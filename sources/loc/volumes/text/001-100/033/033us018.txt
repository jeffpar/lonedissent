SUPREME COURT.

JAMES ERWIN, APPELLANT V. HUGH

M.

BLARE, APPELLEE.

An attorney at law, in virtue of his general authority as sueh, is, eatitled to
take out execution upon a judgment recovered by him for his client, and to
procure a satisfaction thereof by a levy on lands or otherwise, and to receive
the money due on the execution; and thus to discharge the execution.
And if the judgment debtor has a right to redeem the property sold under
the execution within a particular period of time, by payment of the amount
to the judgment creditor, who has become the purchaser of the property,
there is certainly strong reason to contend that the attorney is implicitly
authorized to receive the amount, and thus indirectly to discharge the lien
on the land. At least, if (as is asserted at the bar) this be the common
course of practice in the state of Tennessee, it will furnish an unequivocal
sanction for such an act.

APPEAL from the circuit court of the United States for West
Tennessee.
In the circuit court of West Tennessee Hugh M. Blake, the
appellee, filed a bill on the equity side of the court against
James Erwin, now the appellee, to enjoin further proceedings
in an ejectment brought in that court by Erwin, and to compel
him to convey the legal title of the property described in the
ejectment, according to the provisions of an act of the assembly
of Tennessee passed in 1820, which provides that "it shall
and may be lawful for any debtor, whose interest in any real
estate may be sold, under execution, at any time within two
years after such sale, on payment or tender thereof to the purchasei or purchasdrs, or on payment or tender thereof to any one
claiming under such purchase, the princi. "l money bid at such
sale, with ten per, cent interest per annum thereon, together
with all such other lawful charges, if any there be, to redeem
the interest that may have been sold; and upon payment or
tender thereof as aforesaid, in such bank notes as are receivable
on executions, it shall be the duty of the then claimant, to
reconvey said interest to said debtor, but at the cost and charge
of such debtor.
The substance of the bill, answer and proofs, is stated in the
decree of the circuit court, as follows-:
"The complainant set forth in the bill, that he was a citizen
of the state of Tennessee, and that on the 3d day of September

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v.. Blake.].

1824, he was seised and possessed, in his own right, of a tract of
land situate in Lincoln county, in said state, containing about
three hundred and fifty acres, bounded on the south by the land
of Robert Case, on the north by that of Robert Wilson, on the
east by the land of Joel Cummins, and the west by the land of
John Marr and John W. Blake; that on the said 3d day of Septehiber 1824, the same was sold by the proper officer, under an
execution founded ona decree of the chanceiy court, held at Columbia, rendered in favour of James Brittain, executor of the last
will, &c. of Joseph Brittain deceased against complainant and
others ; that said James Brittain became the purchaser of said
tract of land at said sale, for the price of one hundred and sixtytwo dollars, and received the sheriff's deed therefor; that James
Erwin, a citizen of the state of Louisiana, in the month of September 1823, obtained a judgment against complainant and
others, securities-of one Brice M. Garner, for the sum of upwai'ds
of twelve hundred dollars : that, on the 21st of August 1826,
one John P. M'Connell, having acquired an interest in said
last mentioned judgment, in pursuance of an arrangement with
said James Erwin, and, for the benefit of himself and said Erwin, redeemed said tract of land from said James Brittain, by
advancing the purchase money paid for the same by said Brittain, together with ten per cent interest thereon, and offered to
credit said judgment of said Erwin, against complainant, the
sum of one thousand dollars,.under the provisions of an act of
assembly of the state of Tennessee, passed in the year 1820;
and, therefore, said James Brittain conveyed said tract 5f land
to said Erwin. Said bill further set forth, that the complainant, with a view to avail himself of the privilege of redeeming
said tract of land from said Erwin, did, before the expiration of
the term of two years from the date of said sheriff sale, pay to
James Fulton, the attorney and agent of said Erwin, twelve
hundred and seventy-six dollars and seventy cents, including
the amount advanced by said Erwin and M'Connell to said
Brittain , and also one thousand and ninety-four dollars and
seventy cents of the said judgment of said Erwin against complainant, leaving a balance due on said judgment of two hundred and twenty-three dollars and fifty-five cents, which one
Robert Dickson assumed to pay to said M'Connell, who was
interested in said judgiment of said Erwin to the amount, as

SUPREME COURT.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

complainant was informed and believed, and said M'Connell
accepted said assumpsit in satisfaction of so much of said judgment. Said bill further charges, that said James Fulton was
fully authorized to receive said money by said Erwin, on the
application of complainant toredeem said land, and that MConnell was authorized, and had a right to relieve complainant
from the payment of s- much of said judgment as said Dickson
assumed to pay ; tha', nevertheless he, said Erwin, had refused
to reconvey aid tract of land to complainant, although he,hal
feceived said suni of money, paid to the said James Fulton, his
agent., as said agent had informed complainant; but had.
commenced an action of ejectment in this honourable court-to
recover ppssession of the same. The bill prayed that complainant might be permitted to redeem said land, and that the
legal-title to the same might, by decree of the coL rt, be divested
out of the said James Erwin, and be vested in the complainant,
and his heirs; and for personal relief.
The defendant admitted, in his answer, the purchase of the
tract of land by Brittain under execution, .the day and year
set forth in the bill, and for the price therein specified; that he
had recovered a judgment against complainant, as set forth in
the bill, and that M'Connell had .redeemed the land from James
Brittain, as alleged by.complainant, for his, the defendant's
benefit, and that Brittain had conveyed the land to him. The
defendant denied that M'Connell had any interest in the judgment obtained in the name of the defendant against complainant; but admitted that he had sold the note, upon which said
ptymnent was founded, to M'Connell; that he had received
about two hundred dollars in part payment for the same, and"
that he had taken M'Connell's iote for the balanoe, upon which
he had brought suit and obtained a judgment, before September 1826, but alleged that it was understood between him and
M'Connell, and before that time, that be, defendant, should
have. the benefit of the judgment against Garner 'andcomplainants, and when paid was to be in discharge of the judgment
which defendant had obtained against M'Connell.. The defendant denied that James Fulton, or any other person for him,
was authorized to receive any thing else than specie, or to make
any arrangements in regard, to the payment of the amount,
necessary to be paid by complainant within two years from the

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

date of the sale of said land, than were implied in his instructions to the said Fulton, which he alleges were, that the whole
sum should be paid in specie. Defendant denied that he had
received any money from said Blake,-or any one else, in payment of his claim against said complainant, and insisted that
the provisions of the act of asiembly had not -been complied
with in such manner as to entitle .complainant to redeem.
It appeared from the proofs in the cause, that, some short
time before the 3d:of September 1826, when it appeared' the
term had expired within-which the complainant had a right to
redeem the said tract of land, the defendant Erwin was in the
county of Lincoln, where all the persons concerned, except
himself, resided ; and in the presence of Garner, the principal
in the judgment recovered by Erwin against complainant, and
who was also clerk of the county court of said county, directed
James Fulton, Esq. who had beei the attorney employed in
prosecuting the suit, in which judgment had been obtained
against complainant, to receive the money which might be
tendered by complainant for the purpose of redeeming said
tract of land, and if he thought it a case which was entitled
to specie, to require the payment to be made in specie.. It
further appeared, that Fulton, having business in another
county, appointed one Francis Porterfield to attend to the business for him in his absence, and instructed him to receive from
complainant nothing but specie, or bank notes at such a discount as would make them equivalent to specie. It also
appeared that Brice M. Garner was insolvent and unprincipled;
that a principal-object of said Erwin in requesting Fulton to
receive the money from complainant, was to preventa fraudulent acknowledgement of payment of the redemption money by
Garner, who, as clerk of the county court, had a right to receive
it in the absence of the creditor. For this reason, Fulton
appeared to have been particular in his instructions to Porterfield, to prevent the payment of the money into the -handsof
Garner, and to see that he did not practise any fraud upon
Erwin, in the county court. It further appeared that, on the
2d day of September 1826, the complainant paid into the hands
of Porterfield, under the instructions of Fulton, the sum of nine
hundred dollars, the principal part thereof in specie,.and the
balance in such bank notes, as made them equivalent to specie ;

SUPREME COURT.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

that said Porterfield agreed to accept the promise, or assumpsit,
of William Husbands, the sheriff of the county, for the payment
of three hundred dollars, in satisfaction.of so much, and that
J. P. M'Connell agreed that he would look to one R. Dickson
for the two hundred dollars, the amount to which he alleged
he, was entitled out of the judgment against complainant.
Porterfield, at the same tinio, pledged himself that Fulton, the
lawyer and agent of Erwin, would sanction the arrangement,
and that 'the complainant should sustain no injury in consequence of it. It appeared that Fulton, the agent, did sanction
what had been done by Porterfield in his absence, and, on the
7th day of September 1826, gave complainant a receipt, in the
name of said Erwin, for the sum of one thousand two hundred
and seventy-six dollars and seventy-six cents, and at the same
time recognized the right of said M'Connell to control so much
of said judgment as he claimed an interest in. It further
appeared to the court, by the testimony of the witness present,
that when Erwin requested Fulton to attend to the receipt of
the redemption money, he had given him full authority to act
for him, and that whatever he might do would be acquiesced
in. It also appeared that :Erwin, by his letter of the 8th of
September 1826, to Fulton, written after he had been informed,
by a letter from M'Connell, of many of the most material
particulars of the arrangement of the 2d of September,,admitted
the authority of Fulton to bind him by any thing done under
his, Fultins instructions or authority, or by any one appointed
by him and acting under his instructions. It further appeared,
that M'Connell continued to have an interest in the judgment
obtained against complainant, up to the 2d of September
1826; and that he had employed counsel, and had the managenient of the whole business until the instructions were
given to said Fulton by Erwin, a short time before the day on
which the money was paid. It also appeared, that said Erwin
had notice of the appointment of said Porterfield'by Fulton, to
act in the matter for him, before the 2d of September 1826,
and that lie did not object to his appointment. It-did not appear that the complainant had any notice of the instruction of
Erwin to his agent, that nothing but specie would be received.
The money received by Fulton appeared to havebeen paid
over to the agent of Erwin, but it did not appear that Erwin

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

had ever received it. The alance of the amount he had a
right to demand, and for which Husbands became accountable,
Erwin refused to ;eceive.
The case was argued by Mr Hardin, for the appellant;
and by Mr Bell, for the appellee.
Mr Hardin contended, that the appellee had not complied
with the requisites of the act of assembly-that he had" instructed his attorney and agent to insist on the redemption
money being paid in specie, and had never waived his right to
be thus paid. If a waiver had taken place, it was without his
authority, or that of any one who had a right to do so. He
cited Sugden on Vendors 175, 470, 472. The right to redeem,
under the act of assembly, depends on conditions, precedent,
and must be strictly complied with. Cited, 2 Bl. Com. 11.
119.
As to the contract under which the debt arose, he said it
was made before the act of assembly authorizing the payment
of debts on judgments if bank notes was passed; and so far
as the law affected such contracts, it had been decided to be
unconstitutional in Tennessee. But a part of a law may be
unconstitutional, and a part not; and a party may avail himself of the part which is valid, and reject that which is void.
The appellant had a right to insist on a full compliance with
the act, as to redemption of the property sold under the execution, notwithstanding the unconstitutional provision as to
bank notes.
The case is not like a forfeiture, but is one of an absolute
sale, liable to be defeated by payment of the purchase money,
and this in money, not in bank notes. The provision for redemption is by statute; and time was essential, and could not
be dispensed with.
The whole question in the case turns on the power of F-ulton, and the ratification of his acts by the appellant. He de.
nied both as claimed by the appellee.
Mr Bell, for the appellee, argued, that Blake could not be
called upon to pay specie. The money to redeem the land
was, by the law of Tennessee, to be any money in which the

SUPREME COURT
[Erwin v. Blake.]

debt could be collected in bank notes. If this part of the law
was unconstitutional the whole act was void; and there could
be no right to redeem at all. 'The appellant must abide by
the law in all its parts.
The contract was not that payment should be made in specie-it was not such a contract; and the validity of the law
of Tennessee, relati've to payment in bank notes, is not inv6lved in this case,- because, as Erwin claimed the benefit of.
the same, he was bound by all its provisions, and to accept his
debt in bank notes.
He also contended that the evidence showed that Fulton,
the attorney of Erwin, had f'ull authority from his principal to
waive the demand of specie, and to delegate that authority to
another, which he had done. Under this delegation, confirmed
by Erwin, the arrangement by which the redemption took
place was made and was ratified.
The deed from the sheriff is to be considered as a guarantee
for the debt due on the judgment, and in the nature of a mortgage; and the right to redeem resting entirely on equitable
principles, and time not being material if compensation can be
made for it, .the case is with the appellee. It is not Within the
rule that the condition must be performed, unless prevented.by
absolute necessity.
As to the powers of an attorney, he cited, 12 Vesey 282; as
to equity jurisdiction, Martin's Rep. 83.
Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The principal question, in the case is, whether the plaintiff,
Blake, has entitled himself to a re-conveyance of the land in
controversy against the judgment creditor, Erwin ; the same
land having been sold upon execution, and being, by the laws
of Tennessee, redeemable by the owner at, any time within
two years after the sale: and that question turns upon this,
whether the judgment has been. according to thos6 laws duly
discharged within the two years by the judgment debtor. It
is clear from the evidence, that Fulton, as attorney of Erwin,
did give a receipt discharging the whole of the claim under
the judgment, amounting, on the last day, when the land wag
redeemable, to one thousand five hundred and one dollars and
seventeen cents : and if he either had an original authority:so

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v. Blake.1

to do, or his acts have since been confirmed by Erwin, then
Blake is entitled to the relief sought by the bill.
It is material, in the first place, to state, that the original
demand on which the judgment was rendered, was, before the
suit was brought, assigned by Erwin to one M'Connell ; and
that the suit was commeficed and carried on through all its
stages by.Fulton, for and under the direction of M'Connell, although in the name of Erwin : and the latter never interfered
in the suit until after the judgment had, by the redemption of
Brittain's prior judgment, been levied, and fixed as a lien on the
land. Now, it cannot be doubted that if the assignment to
M'Connell was never rescinded, he alone had a right to control
the judgment and the levy, and the subsequent proceedings as
to the redemption by Blake. And in point of fact, he was not
only connusant of, but party to the arrangement made by
Fulton with Blake, by which the judgment claim against the
land was discharged. Was then the assignment antecedently
rescinded? Erwin in his answer affirms that it was, but the
evidence in the cause does not support his averment: on the
contrary, it is established by Erwin's own acknowledgement,
in his letter of the 6th of September 1826, that M'Connell continued to have an interest in it until long after all these transactions; and M'Connell, in his testimony, asserts his own claim
in the most positive manner: so that, at-most, the case cannot be
judicially treated as one where there had been a total rescision
of the assignment; but only subsequent negotiations, out of
which other equities connected with it arose between the
parties.
But, assuming that the assignment hadbeen rescinded, still it
is clear that Erwin adopted the acts of M'Connell in regard
to the suit, and recognized Fulton as his attorney in the conduct of it. He never repudiated him as his attorney, and never
gave any notice to Blake that he had not as complete authority in the premises as any other attorney in the management
of a suit at law. Now it is not denied that an attorney at law,
in virtue of his general authority as such, is entitled to take
out execution upon a judgment recovered by him for his client,
and to procure a satisfaction thereof by a levy on lands or otherwise, and to receive the money due on the execution ; and thus
to discharge the execution. And if the judgment debtor has a
VOL -VHII.--D

SUPREME COURT.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

right to redeem the property sold under the execution within a
particular period of time, by payment of the umount to the
judgment creditor, who has become the purchaser of the properry, there is certainly strong reason to contend that the attorney is impliedly authorized to receive the amount, and thus
indirectly to discharge the lien on the land. At least, if (as is
asserted at the bar) this'be the common course of practice in
the state of Tennessee, it will furnish an unequivocal sanction
for such an act.
But it is not necessary in the present case to rely on this
ground, if Erwin did in fact give an express general authorty to Fulton to act in the premises, or if he has since ratified
the acts of Fulton in discharging the judgment. Some of the
judges are of opihion, that the evidence in the case establishes
that Erwin expressly delegated to Fulton general authority to
act in the premises, and to receive the money due under the
judgment, according to his own discretion ; and that the direction of Erwin to Fulton to demand the payment in specie, was
not intended to operate as a positive restriction upon that discretion, but was merely a strong expression of the wishes of
Erwin on the subject. Fulton, in his deposition, states, that
Erwin " called upon Kincannon to bear witness that he had
appointed me his attorney in the business, and that I was
authorized to receive the money upon the claim; and that
whatever I should do upon the subject, he would abide by."
Kincannon fully confirms this sta'tement in his deposition ; and
says, "Mr Erwin did call on me to bear witness that Mr Fulton was fully authorized to transact the whole business for
him. From all that was said by Mr Erwin, I did believe that
any course taken by Mr Fulton would be sanctiond by him, and
that he would be bound to all intents and purposes by his
acts." And he adds, in another place, "it was my understanding, and I thought from all that was said by Mr Erwin,
that it was so understood by hirs*elf and all others present, that
Mr Fulton was fully authorized to act for Mr Erwin in relation
to the whole matter. Mr Erwin did say, that he would -ratify
or sanction Mr Fulton's acts, or words of that import." The
conve'sation here detailed is a part of the same conversation
between the parties, in which the direction was given by.Erwin to Fulton to demand specie in payment; and therefore it

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

may properly be taken into consideration as a qualification of
that direction.
Others of thejudges are of opinion, that, taking the fair scope
of the language of Erwin in his letters to Fulton after the transaction, it amounts to a ratification of the acts of Fulton. Thus
in his letter of the 8th of September 1826, written after M'Connell (as it admits) had given him information of what had
been done, he says, " this of course is not a compliance with
the law, and I am induced to think they cannot now have even
a probable right to claim the land, as the deed is now in my
name. They cannot claim any indulgence granted by any
one except you and myself, no one else having authority to
grant any. Whatever you may [have] authorized others to do
in your absence, in accordance with my instructions, or yours, of
course will be adhered to by me ; but nothing more." Now, these
expressions are very significant as to the extent of the original
authority given to Fulton.

They show that specie was not

absolutely to be insisted Upon, or payment at the time absolutely required ; for it is admitted, that indulgence might be
granted by Fulton; "no one else having authority to grant
any." And as to the point of ratification, the language is still
more direct, for it is declared that whatever had been done in
Fulton's absence, in accordance with his instructions, would
be adhered to. Now, at this time, Fulton had ratified all Porterfield's acts, and indeed, except as to the giving time for a
small piart of the money, Porterfield had not deviated from his
original instructions.

On the 9th of September Fulton wrote

to Erwin, giving him a full account of all the transactions, and
why he had deviated "from the strict letter of his instructions."
And he also sent to Erwin the one thousand three hundred
and five dollars received by him ; and offered to pay him the
remaining sum of two hundred dollars then due. In the reply
of Erwin to this letter, on the 12th of September, he declines receiving the money, for reasons, which (he says) he will explain,
when he has the pleasure to see Fulton; and adds, "my
course I am sure, on explanation, will be satisfactory to you,
major Porterfield and to M'Connell." But he no where in thit
letter expresses any disapprobation of the conduct of Fulton;
and he does not attempt to qualify the language of his former letters, or to disavow the acts of Fulton as a breach of his instruc-

SUPREME COURT.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

tions. His object seems to have been, without returning the
money to Fulton or to Blake, or doing any positive act, to retain the whole affair in its then state, that he might make use
of any doubts as to the extinguishment of his claim, for his own
advantage in other business. "The judgment" (says he) "is
in my name, and I alone can control it. I am fully aware 6f
the hold I nov maintain over Garner, or rather over Blake's
land, and I am determined to use it towards the security of my
other claims." Under these circumstances, the evidence is
deemed fairly to establish the conclusion, that the acts of Fulton were ratified by Erwin ; and never were intended to be repudiated by him. Upon these grounds, and for these reasons,it
is the opinion of the court, that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought by his bill. But it ought not to be granted, except
upon the terms, that all the money dueat the time when the
land was redeemed by the plaintiff, should be paid over to the
debtor. The balance of two hundred dollars does not appear
ever to have been paid by Dickson ; and the one thousand
three hundred and five dollars and seventeen cents, for aught
that appears in the record, is still in the hands of Talbert, and
never has been received by Erwin. The decree of the circuit
court, granting relief, must therefore be varied, so far as to
make it dependent upon the payment of the whole one thousandfivehundred and five dollarsand seventeen cents toErwin.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from- the circuit court of the United States for the district
of West Tennessee, and was argued by counsel: on consideration whereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court,
that upon the full payment by the said Blake, of the sum of one
thousand five hundred and five dollars and seventeen cents, due
on the judgment of the said Erwin against the said Blake, as in
the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as has not been
already received by the said Erwin in satisfaction thereof-the
said money to be paid to the said Erwin personally, or brought
into the circuit 'court for his use; all the estate, right, title and
interest in the said tract of land, in the proceedings mentioned,
which was vested in the said Erwin by the deed executed to
him by James Brittain, bearing date the 21st day of August

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Erwin v. Blake.]

1826, in the proceedings mentioned, and under and in virtue of
the judgment of the said Erwin, levied on the same as in the
same proceedings mentioned, ought tobe, and hereby is, declared to be restored to, and revested in him, the said Blake, and
his heirs and assigns, in the same maihner as if the same tract of
land had not been sold to satisfy the judgment of the said
Brittain in the proceedings mentioned. And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said Erwin, upon the
payment of the said money as aforesaid, do forthwith, by a
suitable deed and conveyance, convey the same estate, right,
title and interesL, in and to the same tract of land, to the said
Blake and his heirs and assigns accordingly. And it it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed,- that upon the payment of
the said money as aforesaid, all further proceedings in the ac.
tion of ejectment brought for the recovery of the said tract of
land in the proceedings mentioned be, and the same are hereby
perpetually stayed and enjoined; and that in the meantime, and
until such payment, no further proceedings be had in the said
action. And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that
the decree of the circuit court, so far as it differs fron this decree
be, and the same is hereby reversed, and that in all other respects it be, and is hereby'affirmed: and that this cause be,
and the same is hereby remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings, to carry the present decree into effect.
