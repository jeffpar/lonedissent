SAMUEL

HAZARD'S ADMINISTRATOR,

TIE NEW

PLAINTIFF IN ERROR V.

ENGLAND MAR.INE INSURANCE COMPANY.

Insurance was effected in Boston, Massachusetts, on the ship Dawn, from
New York to the Pacific opean, on a whaling voyage, and until her return.
The letter brdering insurance was written in New York, by the owner of
the ship, who resided there ; and the ship was represented to be a " coppered ship." The ship, on the outward passage struck upon a rock at the
Cape de Verd Islands, and knocked off a part of her false keel, but proceeded
on her voyage and continued cruising, and encountered some heavy weather,
until she was finally compelled to return to the Sandwich Islands; where
she arrived in a leaky condition, and upon examination by competent surveyors she was found to be so entirely perforated by worm, in her keel, stem
and stern post, and some of her planks, as to be wholly innavigable: and
being incapable of repair at that place, she was condemned and sold. The
vessel, on her outward voyage, had put into St Salvador, and both at the
Cape de Verds, and at St Salvador, her bottom was examined by swim'
mers. It was in evidence, that the terms ", a coppered ship, " had a different
meaning, and were differently understood in Boston and in New York.
Held, that the assured, in making the representation in the letter, was
bound by the usage and meaning of the terms contained therein, in New
York, where the letter was written and his ship was moored, and not by
those of Boston, where the insurance was effected.
Insurance. A representation to obtain an insurance, whether it be made in
writing or by parol, is collateral to the policy; and as it must always influence the judgment of underwriters, in regard to the risk, it must be substantially correct. It differs from an express warranty; as that always makes
a patt of the policy, and must be strictly and literally performed.
The underwriters are presumed to know the usages of foreign ports to which
insured vessels are destined; elso the usages of trade, and the political condition of foreign nations. Men who engage in this business: are seldom
ignorant of the risks they incur ; and it is their interest to make themselves
acquainted with the usages of the different ports of their own country, and
also those of foreign countries. This knowledge'is essentially connected
with their ordinary business; and by acting on the presumption that they
possess it, no violence or injustice is done to their interests.
It is upon the representation that the underwriters are enabled to calculate
the risk,and fix the amount of the premium; and if any fact material to the
risk be misrepresented, either through fraud, mistake or negligence, the
policy is avoided. It is therefore immaterial in what way the loss may
arise, where there has been such a misrepresentation as to avoid the policy.
The judge of the circuit court, on the trial of the case, charged the jury, that
" if they should find that in the Pacific ocean worms ordinarily assail and
enter the bottoms of vessels, then the loss of a vessel destroyed by worms
would not be a loss within the policy." By the court: In the form in
which this instruction was given, there was no error.

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]
The circuit court instructed the jury, "that if there was no misrepresentation
in regard to the ship, and she substantially corresponded with the representation, still if the injury which occurred to the vessel at:the Cape de
Verds were reparable, and could have been repaired there, or at St Salvador, or at any other port at which the vessel stopped in the course of the
voyage, the master was bound to have caused such repairs to be made, if
they were material to prevent any loss. And if he omitted to make such
repairs, because he did not' deem them necessary ; and if by such neglect
alone the subsequent loss of the ship by worms was occasioned, the underwriters.are not liable for any such loss." By the court: If the loss by
worms is not within the policy, as has been decided, the court did not err
in giving this instruction. The negligence or vigilance of the master
would be of no importance under the circumstances, in regard to the liability of the underwriters.

IN error to the circuit court of the United States for the Massachusetts district.
In the circuit court, an action of assumpsit was instituted
by thie plaintiff in error,.as the administrator of Thomas 'Hazard, deceased, on a policy of insurance, dated 26th December
1827, whereby the defendants caused to be assured Josiah Bradlee & Co., for Thomas Hazard, Jun., of New York, fifteen
thousand dollars on the ship Dawn, and outfits at and from
New York to the*Pacific ocean and elsewhere, on a whaling
voyage, during her stay and fishing, and until her return to
New York, or port of discharge in the United States, with liberty, &c.
The declaration contained various counts, stating a total
loss of the .1essel, and a partial loss of the cargo, and also a
partial damage to the vessel by perils of the seas.
It appeared in evidence, that the vessel sailed on the 29th of
December 1827; and on her outward passage struck upon a
rock at the Cape de Verd Islands, and knocked off a portion of
her false keel, but proceeded on her voyage, and continued
cruising, and encountered some heavy weather, until she was
finally compelled to return to the Sandwich Islands, where she
arrived in December 1829, in a very leaky condition ; and upon
an examination by competent surveyors, she was found to be
so entirely perforated by worms in her keel, stem and stern
post, and some of her planks, as to be wholly innavigable ; and
being incapable of repair at that nlace, she was condemned and
sold.
It also appeared in evidence, that after the vesset sustained

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. Now England Mar. Ins. Company.]

the injury at the Cape de Verds, she put into St Salvador ; and
that both at tho Cape de Verds, and at St Salvador, the bottom
of the ship was examined by swimmers.
The defence to the action was rested on the following
grounds.
1. That there was a misrepresentation of a fact material to
the risk, in the application made for the insurance, which was
by letter, and in which the vessel was represented to be a coppered ship. It being alleged by the defendants, that by the
terms "coppered ship," applied to a vessel destined upon. a
whaling voyage in the Pacific ocean, it would be understood,
according to the usages of insurance in Boston, that the sides
and bottom of her keel were covered with copper ; and they
adduced evidence to prove this position, and also that the keel
of this vessel was not so covered.
And upon this point the plaintiff produced evidence to prove
that the keel was so covered, or if not, that it was nevertheless
covered with leather, and which was alleged to afford an
equally permanent and effectual protection against worms.
The letter ieferred to was as follows :
.New York, Twelftt month 22, 1827.
JOsIAH BRADLEE & Co., BOSTON.
Respected Friends :.-My ship, the Dawn, of New York,
Henry Gardiner master, is now nearly ready for sea, and will
probably sail in the course of next week on a whaling voyage to the Pacific ocean and elsewhere. I wish you to-have
twenty-five thousand dollars insured for my account, on the
ship and outfit, the ship valued at fifteen thousand dollars, and
the outfit valued at ten thousand dollars, each subject to its
own average-the outfit to be transferred to ny share of the oil,
which will be about two-thirds of the oil, as fast as it shall be obtained; the oil valued at sixty cents a gallon. If any partof the
oil should be sent home by any other vessel or vessels, that part
of the oil not to be deducted from the sum insured on the outfit. Our ships sometimest-ake pil on their outward passage,
and 'wish to send it home ; therefore you will please to have it
stipulated in the policy for liberty to do it, and also for liberty
to stop from time to time to procure refreshments, as is usual
and customary on such voyages. This is the same ship that
you had insured for me in Boston some years since. I will only

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

observe, that I believe her to be one of the strongest and best
ships in the whole fishery: she has been newy coppered to
light water mark, above which she is sheathed with leather to
the wales, and fitted in every respect in the best manner, and
commanded by an experienced, capable and prudent master,
which entitles her to be insured at as low a premium as any
ship in that business. You got her insured for me the last
time, on a similar voyage, against all risks, for six per cent,
although I understand that premiums have risen a little in
Boston. I can but hope that you will be able to get this assurance effected at six and a half or seven per cent-indeed I should
not be willing to give more than eight per cent. Hoping to
hear from you soon on the subject of this insurance, I remain,
with great respect, your assured friend,
THOMAS HAZARD, JUN.

The plaintiff also gave in evidence a letter from his intestate,
of which the following is a copy.
New York, Eighth month 20, 1824.
JosIAH BRADLEE & CO.

Esteemed Friend :-My ship, -the Dawn, of New York,
John H. Butler master, sailed yesterday morning on a whalitig voyage to the Pacific ocean and elsewhere. I wish you
to have twenty-five thousand dollars insured, provided you
can get it effected at seven per cent or under. This ship is
about three hundred and twenty-seven tons, built in this city,
of excellent materials ; is between seven and eight years old,
copper fastened, newly sheathed with wood, which was put on
with composition nails, and then sheathed over the wooden
sheathing with sole leather, which was also put on with composition nails. Ship valued at fifteen thousand dollars, and
the outfit at ten thousand dollars, each subject to its own average ; the latter to be transferred to the oil as fast as it may be
obtained (say my proportion, which will be about two-thirds of
all lhat may be obtained), the same to be valued at forty cents
per gallon ; if part should be sent home by any other vessel or
vessels, that part not to be deducted from the amount insured
on the outfit. Sometimes our ships take oil between here and
the Cape de Verd Islands, and wish to send it home ; therefore
I wish you to stipulate in the policy for liberty to do it. Hop-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

ing to hear from you soon on the subject of this letter, I remain,
your assured and very respectful friend,
THOMAS HAZARD, JUN.

P. S. It must be stipulated in the policy that the ship have
liberty to stop for refreshments, as isusual and customary on
such voyages.
The evidence was submitted to the jury under the following
charge, by the presiding judge of the circuit court.
That, as to the objection taken to the plaintiff's right of recovery, upon the ground, that there was no sufficient abandonment made out, whatever might be his opinion of the validity,
of the objection, he should, for the purposes of the trial, rule,
and he accordingly did-rule, that under all the circumstances of
the case, the abandonment was sufficient in point of law. 2.
That the representation and facts stated in that letter (the
letter of the plaintiff's intestate to his agents, left with the defendants at the time application was made for insurance), so
far as they were material to the risk, must be substantially
true: that if the ship was not coppered, as stated in that letter;
and the ship did nrat, in that respect, correspond with the representation, and the difference between the facts and the representation was material to the risk, then the plaintiff was not
entitled to recover upon the policy : and le left the facts as to
representation and the materiality, to the jury. That, in
ascertaining whether the vessel was coppered, it was for the
jury to determine what constitutes a " coppered ship;" and if.
the jury should find from the testimony, that inorder to constitute what is called a coppered ship, the bottom of the keel,
and the sides of the keel, as well as the sides of the vessel,
must be coppered ; and they should further find that this
vessel was not so coppered, and the deficiency was material to
the risk: then there was not a compliance with the terms of the
letter left with the underwriters, and the underwriters were
not liable upon the policy. Or, if they should find -that a ship
coppered on hersides, and also on the sides of the keel, and
not on the bottom of the keel or,false keel, would meet the representation of a coppered ship on other voyages, but that in
whaling voyages in the Pacific ocean, the usual and customary
mode is to copper the bottom of the keel or false keel; and it is
understood byunderwriters, when application is made for insurVOL. VIII.-3 v

SUPREME (iOURT.
(Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.)

ance on such voyages, that vessels are so coppered, unless the
contrary is'stated ; then, inasmuch as the letter applying for
insurance is an application for insurance of a vessel on a whaling voyage in the Pacific ocean, the underwriters had a
right to consider the representation in the letter as describing
the vessel as coppered, in the manner in which vessels are tually coppered for such voyages: and if the ship was not so
coppered, and that deficiency was material to the risk, the
terms of the letter were not complied with, and the defendants
were not bound by the policy.
1st. The court further charged, that in ascertaining what
is to be understood as a coppered ship in applications for insurance on a voyage of this nature, the terms of the application
are to be understood according to the ordinary sense cind usage
of those terms in the place where the insurance is asked for
and made ; unless the underwriter knows that a different sense
and usags prevail in the place in which the ship is then lying,
and in which the owner resides, and from which he writes
asking for the insurance ; or unless the underwriter has some
other knowledge that the owner uses the words in a different
sense and usage from that which prevail in the place where
the insurance is asked for and made.
2d. The court further charged the jury, that although the
terms of the letter applying for insurance were not to be considered a technical warranty, yet, if the coppering of the ship
as stated in the letter on which the insurance was made, was
substantially untrue and incorrect in a point material to the
risk; such a misrepresentation would discharge the underwriters, although the ship was partially coppered, and although
the loss did not arise from any deficiency in the coppering.
3d. The court further charged the jury, that if there
was no
misrepresentation in regard to the ship, and she substantially
corresponded w*; .h the representation; still, if the injury Which
occurred at the Cape de Verds was reparable, and could have
been repaired there or at St Salvador, or at any other port at
which the vessel stopped in the course of the voyage, the master was bound to have caused such repairs to be made, if they
were material to prevent any loss. And if he omitted to make
such repairs, because he did not deem them necessary; and if,
by such neglect alone, the subsequent loss of the ship by worms

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v New England Mar. Ins.. Company. ]

was occasioned, the underwriters are not liable for any such
loss so occasioned.
4th. The court further charged, that if the jury should
find, that in the Pacific ocean, worms ordinarily assail and
enter the bottoms of vessels, then the loss of a vessel destroyed
by worms would not be a loss within the policy.
5th. The court further charged, that as the decisions of the
courts in Massachusetts had established that damage arising
from injury by worms was not a loss within the policy; the underwriters in Boston must be deemed as contracting in reference
to those decisions, and not liable for losses from that cause.
The court further charged the jury, that if in consequence of
the injury sustained at Port au Praya, in. the Cape de Verds,
the false keel was torn off, whereby the vessel became exposed
to the action of the worms, and that they thereby obtained entrance and destroyed the vessel, that the loss would not come
within the policy; it being a consequential injury., against
which underwriters are not considered as taking the risk.
The counsel for the plaintiff called upon the court to charge
upon the two following points : That if the jury believed that
the undbrwriters would not have charged a higher rate or premium if the vessel had been correctly represented than they did
charge, and that the insured had not intentionally misrepresented the facts; then the representation contained in the letter
is not material, and does not defeat the policy. Second, if they
believed that the object of coppering the bottom of the keel is
to protect it against worms, and if they also believed the leather
an equal protection, and was put on; in that case the letter
would not be considered a material misrepresentation.
1. The court refused to direct the jury in the terms stated:
but upon this point did direct the jury, that if the fact was not
material to the risk, and would not have varied the conduct of
the underwriters, either as to the premium of insurance, or as
to the underwriting at all, if the fact had been correctly represented, and the insured had not intentionally misrepresented
the facts; then the misrepresentation will not prevent the insured from a recovery in this case, or defeat the policy.
. The court refused to give the directions, in the terms
stated ; but upon this pQint directed the jury, that if the object
of coppering the bottom of the keel was to protect it against

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Co ]

worms, and if.they believed that leatheris an equal protection,
still if the fact was, that the letter of instructions did contain a
representation which was, and must have been understood, as
representing that the keel was'coppered ; and if that fact was
material to the risk, and might have induced the underwriters
to ask a higher premium, or not to have underwritten at all ;
then the misrepresentation of its being copper, when it was
leather, would avoid the policy. But if it was not a fact material to the risk, and would not have changed the conduct of
the underwriters, either as to underwriting at all, or in asking
a higher pretniurn ; then the misrepresentation would not avoid
the policy.
The counsel foi the plaintiff excepted to the charge of the
court, on the points above stated ; and the jury having rendered

a verdict in favour of the defendants,the court entered judgment thereon; and the plaintiff prosecuted this writ of error.
The case, was argued by Mr Selden, for the plaintiff in error;
and by Mr Loring, with whom was Mr Webster, for the defendants.
Mr Selden, for the plaintiff in error, contended, that the
charge of the court was erroneous on all the points operating
against the claim on the underwriters.
Upon the evidence in the case he argued, that it was by no
means clear that "a copperedc vessel," in the interpretation
given to the terms by the underwriters in Boston, required that
the coppering should extend over the false keel. The testimony upon this point, in reference to vessels engaged in the
trade of the Pacific ocean, and'sailing from Boston, was con-

tradictory; while it was fully shown by the evidence of witnesses examined in New York, that ",a coppered ship" was not
required to be coppered in any other manner than that in which
the Dawn was coppered.
The charge of the court is erroneous where it adopts the
rule to be, that the interpretation of the letter requesting insurance is to be such as the terms used in it are understood at the
place where insurance is made. The letter for insurance was
in this case written in New York, and it is to be understood
as it would be in New York. The court excluded the inquiry

JANUARY TERM 1834.

[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

a§ to the meaning of "a coppered ship" in the port of New
York.
Underwriters are presumed to know the usages and customs
of all theplaces from or 0 which they make insurances. In
this case the representation, according to the custom and usage
in the port of New York, was faithfully correct.
Nor could any charge of concealment be made, as the letter
of the owner of the Dawn was put into the possession of the
underwriters ; and that letter describes the ship to be what in
point of fact she was. There is not a pretence of intentional.
Upon these principles were cited, Hughes

2. It is not contended that if it ha1 been known to the
assured that the interpretation of the words describing .the ship
as a coppered ship, was different in Boston from that which
prevailed in New York, the difference should not have been
admitted; and'the description of the vessel should have stated
with more precision the manner in which she was coppered.
But no such information was in the possession of the assured ;
and he, as well as his agents, acted in perfect good faith.
Upon the charge of misrepresentation in the description, the
counsel contended, that it should have been shown on the part
of the underwriters, as there was no allegation of mala fides,
that the facts said to -have been misrepresented, materially contributed to effect the loss.
The proposition laid down in the charge of the court is too
broad. The rules of law relative to contracts of insurance,
do not differ so widely from the rules relative to ordinary
contracts. Those rules in reference to othe.r contracts are, that
all that passed before the contracts shall not be considered.
Unless when fraud is charged, a party cannot go back to the
state of things before the contract was made. Recently, the
disposition of courts has been to assimilate the. principles of
law operating oil contracts of insurance to the law of other
contracts.
The rule claimed for the plaintiffin error applies in all the
class of cases where the party has acted under a want of knOowledge, and without any fraud. This is now the established
principle. The court will always say, that in all cases the

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

injury must have been the consequertce of the very fact represented. But by the rule laid down in the charge of the court
in this case, from its generality and breadth, the underwriter
would be discharged in case of any deficiency of outfit, although
afterwards supplied. Cited, I Moody and Neale's Rep. 367;
22 Common Law Rep. 337; Hughes on Insurance 348; Douglas's Rep. 238; 8 Wendall's Rep. 163.
3. The master of the ship should have made the repairs
required in consequence of the accident to the ship; and if he
did not make them, the underwriters are not discharged in
consequence of his neglect to have the repairs made.
It is contended that after the injury happened, the master
became the agent of the underwriters, as well as of the assured,
for the purpose of making the necessary repairs. This was
most certainly the case in the present controversy, as the judgment of the master was exercised upon the subject of the
repairs, and as th.ey might have been considerable., The
master thought the interests of the assurers were promoted by
the course he pursued; but the charge of the court denies
the right of the master to exercise his discretion, and denies to
the plaintiff the benefit of this principle of the law of insurance.
Froni the period of the accident this agency existed ; and the
assured is not to be subjected to the consequences of its rot
having been properly used. This rule does not exten4 to the
cases in which the technical rules relative to abandonments
prevail. The authorities show that the contract of the owner
is fulfilled when he provides a competent master; and sustain
the principle that, under such circumstances as those of the
case before the court, the master is the agent of all the parties
to the contract of insurance. Cited, 2 Barn. and Ald. 82;
Phillips on Ins. 249; 7 Barn. and Creswell 794; 5 Barn. and
Ald. 171.
4. As to the point whether a loss caused by the destruction
of the vessel by worms is within the policy, it was argued, that
but one case, other than that decided in Massachusetts, sustained the principle claimed for the underwriters in this case;
that was the case in I Espin. Rep. 444. The vessel was
engaged in the slave trade, and the destruction was produced
by lier lying in the rivers in Africa. Her death wound was
received during that time. But in this. case the injury from

JANUARY TERM 1834.
(Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

worms took place while the ship was on the high seas, in the
regular prosecution of the voyage insured. The loss was the
consequence of her navigating the Pacific ocean. The destruction was not from the age of the vessel, but by a cause
which operates on new as well as old ships.
The authorities upon the law of insurance do not sustain
the position laid down by the circuit court in the charge to the
jury. The case of Martin v. The Salem Insurance Company,
2 Mass. Rep. 424, is imperfect; and does not establish the
general principle. It rests upon the case in Espinasse, cited;
and the injury occurred while the vessel was at -the wharf,
detained by the embargo. The loss by worms has been likened
to one sustained by rats, but the cases are dissimilar. In
reference to the liability of underwriters for such losses, the
cases are contradictory. Cited, 1 Binn. 592 ; 4 Camp. 203.
Abbott on Shipping does not class this among the lossesfor
which the assurers are not liable. Abbott 257. In 2 Caines
85, Judge Livingston disapproves of the decision in Rohl v.
Parr, 1 Esp. 444.
Mr Loring, for the defendant.
The first question presented for the consideration of.the court,
is one involving the principles of verbal construction. The defendants maintain, that the ruling of the court was correct ;
that the terms " coppered ship," are to be understood according
to the usage and sense prevailing in the place where the insurance was asked for, and the contract was' made, and to be
performed.
The fundamental principle of verbal construction is, that
words are to be understood in that sense in which the party
using them supposes that the party to whom they are addressed
receives them.
The position laid down by the court, seems a necessary corollary of this general proposition ; for the party using terms
to another, in a place in which he knows that a distinct meaning obtains, must presume that to him such will be their only
import. If he knows that they admit two or more senses, he
either knows that the party to whom they are addressed will
construe them in one rather than in the other, or is bound to
explain the meaning; and if he is ignorant of any meaning dif-

SUPREME COURT.
[Ha ard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

fering from that in which he understands them, he should abide
the consequences, if the other p rty, honestly and without fault
is misled ; for the writer is the author or the mistake, however
inadvertently. And in this particular, the case might be likened to that of an inadvertent trespass, in which the party
occasioning the damage is bound to make indeninity, however
unintentional may have been the act.
In the case at bar, if the plaintiff's testator honestly used the
words in one sense, and the defendants as honestly understood
them in-another; there was a mutual mistake, and therefore no
contract between them: and the case is analogous, if not simi.
lar to that of an inadvertent and innocent misrepresentation,.or
concealment of a fact material to the risk ;in which, according
to the established principles regulating the contract of insurance, the policy is held void. Numerous cases have beendecided, illustrative of the application of this principle. Thus, if
a bill of exchange for a given number of pounds be drawn in
London or Dublin or.Bermuda, and the currency be not speoifled, it will be payable in Irish or Bermudian currency, and not
in pounds sterling. So in cases of contracts made between
parties resident in different countries, in which a difference of
weight or measure prevails, they must be construed according
to the import of the terms in that country where the contract
is to be performed; although the party residing in the other
may have been ignorant of such difference. Potter v. Brown,
5 East 130; Bridge v. Wain, 1 Stark. Rep. 504,; Kearney v.
King, 2 Barn. and Aid..; Benson v. Schneide,. 7 Taunt. 272;
Burrows v. Jenins, 2 Strange 733.
In reply to the position taken by the plaintiff's counsel, that
the rule laid down by the court is not applicable, because the
terms in question were not used in the policy, but in a. col,
lateral paper ; it is submitted, that the paper referred to, being
was apthe written representation upon which the insurance
plie'd for, was the basis of the whole contract, and cani with no
more propriety be termed collateral,- than would be the foundation of a building in reference to Iho superstructure.
It is said, that because the letter was written in New York,
it is to be understood as the terms are there used. But if it
was written, it was not to be read, nor understood, nor acted
upon there, but in Boston. If the plaintiff's testator, instead

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v.Now England Mar. Ins. Company.]

of writing, had applied personally, and used the language in
the city of Boston, it is believed that the rule laid down by the
court would be esteemed correct; and it is not perceived that
there is any substantial difference between the two cases.
It is asked by the plaintiff's counsel, what would have
been the consequence if the question before the court had come"
up in the form of one of seaworthiness instead of one of construction, and it had been proved that this vessel was seaworthy for the voyage, according to the understanding of merchants
in New York, though not so considered in Boston ? The answer is obvious. Admitting, that in such case the insurers
would be liable, because by underwriting a New York ship,
they must be presumed to have known, or been willing to take
the risk of such preparation as is usual in that port; still, such
a view does not cover the case at bar. For here the question.
is one of representation concerning a particular fact affecting
the seaworthiness of the vessel, which the insured was not
bound to make, but which, if made, must be strictly true.
And if it prove otherwise, and be of a fact affecting the-risk,
the policy is void, although the vessel might haive been seaworthy.
If there is a material difference between a leatheren and a
coppered keel, and the insured represented it to be coppered,
when in fact it was covered with leather; it is not the less a
misrepresentation, though both be seaworthy. So that the
question rests wholly upon the inquiry as to what is the proper
construction of the particular terms used, without- reference t9
the question of seaworthiness.
Again, it was urged, that insurers are bound to know the
usages of trade, and of course to know the meaning of the
terms used in trade. It is conceded that they. are bound to
know the usages of trade affecting the risks which they assume;
and it may also be admitted, that they are boundto know the
ordinary meaning of the terms used in their contracts; but
they are only bound to know them as used in those places
where the contract ismade, and to be performed; If, in this
case, at the time when the letter was written, there had been
a difference in the currency between New York and Massachu.
setts, so that a dollar in the former was worth ninety cents
only, while in the latter worth an hundred, the plaintiff's tesviii.--3 w

'SUPREME COURT.
[Hazarm's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ing. Company.]

tator would not have been content to have the terms used in

the proposal, construed according to their meaning in New
York.
The second objection taken by the plaintiff, is to the rule
laid down by the court, that the misrepresentation of a fact
material to the risk, defeats the policy, although the subject of
such misrepresentation may not have contributed to the loss.
This rule of law has been so long established, and has been so
universally recognized, that it is more properly to be considered
as an axiom or postulate in the law of insurance, than a subject for argument.
The comments of the plaintiff's counsel upon the evidence
to this point, are believed to be irrelevant ; for the fact of the
misrepresentation of a circumstance material to the risk being
established, we are stopped in limine, we cannot go farther to
argue what effect the want of copper upon the keel might or
might not have had upon the interest, or rights, or obligations
of the parties; for there are no rights, nor obligations, nor parties; there was no contract. That this rule has been universally recognized, appears by all the elementary writers. I
Marsh. on Ins. 453-456 ; Hughes 345 ; Phillips 80-111 ; 3
Kent's Comm. 230 ; Lynch v. Hamilton, 3 Term Rep. ; Lynch
v. Dunsfort, 14 East 394.
But the plaintiff relies upon the case of Kinn v. Tobin, 1
Moo. and Mal. 367, as establishing a different rule;, yet upon
examination, and a strict application of the language of the
court to the facts then under consideralion, it will not be found
to authorize any such inference. The point upon which it
appears to have been decided was, that the alleged misrepresentation was in fact a different executory agreement, which
could not be proved to vary the written contract; but if fraudulently made, for the purpose of inducing the insurer to subscribe the policy, might be proved to vacate it.
The next point arises upon the refusal of the court to charge
the jury, that if they believe that the object of coppering the
bottom is to protect it against worms, and if the leather were
an equal protection, the letter applying for insurance would
not be considered a material misrepresentation. 'The refusal
of the -pourt seems'however obviously correct;' because the
direction,,prayed fbr, if given, would have prevented the jury

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

from inquiring into the other effects of covering a vessel's bottom with leather instead of copper, beside that of protection
against worms; and which other effects might be material to
the risk and vary the premium, although vessels might not be
coppered on account of them only; as for instance, the well
known tendency of leather to become foul and covered with
shell fish and grass, &c., by means of which her sailing is
materially affected, and her chance of escaping from capture
and other perils diminished, and her voyage prolonged, thus
increasing the duration of the risks insured against. And
although these reasons might not apply in their full extent to
the case at bar, the principle is nevertheless the same; and it
may also be added, that there would be a material difference
in a keel newly coppered, as this was represented to have been,
and one covered with leather three years old, as this was
proved to have been ; and that insurers are not bound to run
the hazard of experiments made contrary to their contract, and
without their knowledge.
The next exception taken by the plaintiff was to the instruction, that if the jury should find that in the Pacific ocean
worms ordinarily assail the bottoms of vessels, a loss from such
a cause would not. be within the policy; and that as the decision of the cdurts in Massachusetts had established this doctrine, the underwriters of this policy must be deemed as contracting in reference to them, and so not liable for such a loss.
Thle first part of this propositipn seems manifestly correct.
If. worms infest the Pacific ocean, so that a vessel upon entering
it, and rot properly protected, is necessarily exposed to destruction, the danger is not an extraordinary peril, against which
alone insurance is made; but a certain one, against which the
insured is bound to provide.
A contrary doctrine would involve the absurdity of converting the contract of insurance into one of indemnity against
certain lot, .
This point has been long established and acquiesced in by
insurers and elementary writers, without question of its soundness. I Esp. Cas. 144; 2 Marsh. 492; Benecke 456; Hughes
218; 3 Kent's Comm. 248.
The suggestion in Phillips 251, is unsupported by authority;

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

and however just such a rule might have been in former times,
it cannot be so considered, now tLat repairs of vessels can be
made in all parts of the world. And the application of the
lex loci is indisputable.
A further exception is to the charge, that if the injury to the
copper might have been repaired, and the subsequent loss by
worms happened by reason of the master's neglect to make
such repairs, the insurefs are not liable.
The general proposition, that the assured is bound to keep
his vessel in a suitable condition to perform her voyage, it is
believed, has never before been questioned. This obligation
upon him as owner, in all cases of charter parties and contracts
of affreightment, is perfect; and, it should seem, ought to be so
with regard to insurers. 1 Abbot on Shipping 218, note (ed.
1829) ; Putnam v. Wood, 3 Mass. 481.
It is true, that the original doctrine of implied warranty of
seawor4ahiness has been somewhat mitigated by late decisions;
it having been recently held that'an excess or deficiency in the
condition of the vessel, removed before a loss, restores the contract. 1 M. and R. 673; 7 B. and C. 794. But no change
has been made affecting the implied contract which the insured is under to do his duty, by keeping his vessel in suitable
repair.
The plaintiff rests this part of his case upon these two positions. 1. That the implied warranty of seaworthiness applies
only to the commencement of the voyage, and is not continuous. 2. That the master, after a disaster, becomes the agent
of the insurers as Nell as of the insured ;;and therefore the insurers.are liable for the conseqtlences of his neglect or mistake
in omitting to repair the damage done by such disaster.
The first position is at least of doubtful authority, and however maintainable upon the strength of English decisions, the
American cases seem to establish a contrary doctrine. It rests
upon the authority of the cases above cited. 1 M. and R.
673; 7 B. and C. 794.
It seems opposed to those general principles heretofore supposed the basis of this contract. Good faith to the assurer,
assuming great hazard for small compensation, havingrno possession or right of'possession of the vessel, nor any knowledge

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's.Administrator v. New England Mar. ins. Company.]

of her condition, nor any power to keep her seaworthy, and
relying therefore entirely upon the skill, care and fidelity of tjie
owner and his agents ; requires that they be held strictly to the
obligation of such skill, care and fidelity, as a condition precedent to any rights under this contract. And public policy,
interested in the preservation of vast amounts of property and
of human life, wholly dependent upon the fidelity with Which
this part of the duty is performed by the insured, equally demands his being holdeh to this strict obligation, in order to
visit upon him, in case of a breach of it, the whole loss, as a
just retribution for his carelessness or neglect.
The American cases referred to are, Tidmarsh v. The Washington Fire and Mar. Ins. Company, 4 Mason 439; Peters et
al. v. The Phoenix Ins. Company, 3 Serg. and Rawle 25.
But if this position were sound, it would not avail the plaintiff; for it would not prove that the insurers are liable for a loss
happening even by a peril insured against, if the direct consequence of unseaworthiness. And still less would it prove, that
they are liable for a loss by a peril not insured against, arising.
from that unseaworthiness, which is the case at bar.
The cases-relied on by the plaintiff, tend to establish merely
this doctrine, that the iihplied warranty of seaworthiness relates
only to the commencement of the voyage, so that if complied
with, the contract still subsists, though there be subsequent
unseaworthiness, which might have been repaired. They do
not sftstain the doctrine, that if a lpss happened from such unseaworthiness, the insurers will be liable for that loss, however
they might be for one arising from any-other cause.
These two propositions are entirely distinct. An implied
warranty is in the nature of a condition precedent to the inception of the contract, without the performance of which it never
takes effect.. The duty of keeping the vessel in a seaworthy
state is a continuing obligation, consequent upon the contract;
the breach of which will not destroy it, though it will visit upon
the insured the consequences of such breach.
The doctrine, that insurers may be holden answerable for
losses occasioned by unseaworthiness, which -might have been
repaired, is at variance with principles of public policy, the received-opinions of insurers, and the reasonable construction of
the language of their contract. It would open a wide door to

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

frauds, by tempting the insured to convert small into great, and
partial into constructive losses..
If, for instance, a partial damage should not amount to the
stipulated average of five per cent on the value of the vessel,
which is necessary to create liability on the part of the insurer;
how easily might it be made one, if left unrepaired until sufficiently increased, or connected with others. And if a partial
loss, one-third of the expense of repairing, which must fall
upon the insured, should be worse for him than a constructive
total loss, as very frequently happens, what would be more
easy than to suffer it to become one . And how readily the
insured and their agents yield to temptations of these descriptions, judicial records furnish plenary evidence.
If a party may insure against loss by a breach of his own
contract, occasioned by the neglect or default of his agent appointed to fulfil it; what limit is there to the temptation to
fraud and the exposure of property and life, short of the negligence and avarice of those who may be entrusted with their
preservation?
That this doctrine is opposed to received opinions, is manifest
from the consideration that no decided case, no judicial obiter
dictum, no opinion of an elementary writer, is adduced in support of the plaintiff's position. The doctrine contended for, if
estabfished, would seem to constitute one, if not the only exception to the elementary rule, that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong.
Again, this doctrine is opposed to the reasonable construction
of the language of the contract. The insurers undertake to
indemnify against losses by perils of. the sea. What then is
such loss in any given case ? It is clearly the extent of damage then sustained, to be estimated by the cost of repairing it
at the time and place when and where such reparation can,
by reasonable diligence, be first had. The loss is then ascertained and determined. The peril and its legitimate consequences have then ceased. The insured cannot, by his own
act or neglect, add to such loss, or superinduce further consequences at the expense of the underwriters.
If the vessel be further exposed, and lost, by reason of the
damage which could have been so repaired, such further loss
is not a legitimate consequence of that peril, because neither

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

inevitable nor reasonable. And, if a vessel so circumstanced
be lost, with or without the occurrence of a new peril, which
would not have proved fatal to her but for the omission to repair
the damage, the subsequent loss is not one by a peril insured
against. Thus, if a vessel be strained, and arrive at a port
where repairs can be made, the expense of such repairs is the
amount of the loss. The peril and its legitimate consequences
have terminated. If she sail without repairs, and founder in
smooth weather, the foundering is not bya peril insured against,
for there was none at the- time. So, if she founder in a gale of
wind, which it could be proved that she would have weathered
had she been properly repaired, the result would be the same.
In neither of these cases is the total loss the necessary or fair
consequence of the peril insured against, but is owing wholly
to the neglect of the assured or his agents.
In such a case, however, the partialloss is by a peril insured
against, and to that extent the underwriters are liable : but the
subsequent total loss was not so ; 'for it was not immediately
owing to any peril, nor necessarily consequent upon any.
The case would be otherwise, if the-damlage were such as
could not by reasonable care have been discovered, or by reasonable diligence been previously repaired; for then all the
consequences of the original peril would be properly considered
as immediate or necessary.
Thus, in the case at bar, the loss of the false keel at the
Cape de Verds, and of the copper (if she was coppered), was a
partial loss, which might have been immediately or soon after
repaired; and for the expense of which reparation the defendants
were accountable, cost what it might. , The subsequent loss
by worms, therefore, was neither an immediate nor inevitable
consequence of the peril there encountered.
If the plaintiff's doctrine be sound, then, as it took two years
after the happening of the peril for the worms to complete the
destruction of the vessel, she is to be considered its having
been kept, for that time, under the perpetual and incessant
operation of the consequences of the peril, by the mere will or
neglect of the insured, at the hazard of the underwriters.
If the master, by his omission to make repairs while in port,
may render the insurers liable for a subsequent loss at sea,
happening by reason of their omission ; why would they not

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mai. Ins. Company.)

be answerable for the loss, should he abandon the ship in port,
instead of repairing her ? The consequences would be far less
serious to the underwriters.
The case of a loss, happening in consequence of the previous
neglect or default of the assured to repair his vessel, ;z plainly
distinguishable from the case cited by the plaintiff, in which it
has been decided that underwriters are answerable for losses
immediately owing to perils insured against; tliough the exposure to such perils be occasioned by the accidental negligence of the master or crew. From the imperfection of human
nature, it must be anticipated that the perils insured against
will thus sometimes occur, and it is not unreasonable therefore
to consider them as ccmprehended in the contract; whereas a
neglect or voluntary omission to make necessary repairs is not
accidental, nor to be anticipated, but is likee any other omission
to fulfil a contract, the consequences of which must fall upon
the guilty party.
Thus, if the insured were himself on board the vessel, he
could not preve-tt her loss by the former cause, ,i. e. some sudden or accidental carelessness, but he could keep his vessel in
good repair ;, and the master in thisrespect is his representative.
Paddock v. Franklin Ins. Co., 11 Pick. 227; 3 Serg. and
Rawle 25.
But if the plaintiff's position were tenable, and insurers were
answerable for losses happening by means of perils insured
against, though occasioned by the previous neglect or default
of the insured.to keep the vessel in a seaworthy condition, such
a doctrine would not embrace the case at bar: for herE the
vessel was not lost 'by any such peril, but by worms, which is
not a peril embraced in this policy.
It surely will not be pretended that underwriters are liable
for the negligence or default of the master, as such, where no
peril insured against was in operation: and neither can they
be liable for a loss occasioned by a peril not insured against,
because occasioned by such negligence.
The second proposition of the plaintiff's counsel was, that
the master, after a disaster, is t be considered as the agent of
the insurers. This is believed to be contrary to all hitherto
received opinions upon this subject. He is the agent, of the
Oiwners until abandonment, or until legal cause for abandon-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

ment, and in the latter case, even after such cause, unless the
owners shall within reasonable time have elected to make such
abandonment.
Any other doctrine would throw upon the insurer the whole
responsibility fairly incumobent upon the insured; would annihilate his part of the contract, and expose the underwriters, not
only to the perils of the seas, but to all the consequences of the
frauds, carelessness, ignorance, unskilfulness and neglect of
the insured and his servants; against which, by the nature of
the contract, he stipulates to provide, and which he alone has
the means of preventing.
It was argued by the plaintiff's counsel that the interest of
the insurers requires that the master be considered their agent
after a disaster; as otherwise he would be induced to make
small repairs at great expense, and to their detriment. It is
suggested in reply, that if he knew the actual extent of the
injury, he must make only such repairs as are reasonably
required. If he make more, the insurers will not be answer-able for the excess; and in case of controversy, a jury must
pass upon the propriety of his proceedings. If, on the other
hand, the extent of the injury or its probable consequences be
doubtful, it is better for the interest of all that they should be
ascertained, at any expense short'of a total loss; than that a further one of property, and it may be of life, should be hazarded.
No perfect rule, infallible for the protection of both parties,
can be prescribed; but that which places the responsibility of
honest discretion and reasonable care upon the insured and his
agent, must be far less liable to abuse and to produce injury
and injustice, than that which exonerates them from all responsibility whatever.
The last ground of exception is, to the ruling of the court,
that if by the loss of the false keel the vessel became exposed
to the action of the worms, which thereby obtained entrance
and destroyed her, the loss by worms was a consequential injury, and so not Within the policy. The legal maxim, "causa
proxima, non remota, .spectatur," is recognized by all writers
upon this subject, and in"many adjudged cases. Green v.

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. Now England Mar. Ins. Company.]

These cases are so analogous to that at bar, as to seem decisive of the question.
A cause cannot be said to be immediate, within the meaning
of the law, where the consequence is ndt inevitable; but may
be avoided by reasonable skill, care and diligence. .To say,
as is contended in this case, that the loss of the copper was the
immediate cause of the destruction of the vessel, because the
entrance of the worms is the inevitable consequence; is to beg
the question.
It is true, that such was the inevitable consequence of thu
vessel's remainingin that condition; but not true, that it was the
inevitable consequence of the injury.
The doctrine relied upon by the plaintiff, that a consequence
is inevitable, where it must follow from the cause in the given
conjuncture of circumstances, is too broad. For in that sense,
all consequences from any cause are inevitable. And it would
be just as true to say, that the destruction of a ship by fire was
inevitable after it was communicated to her, though it might,
by reasonable diligence, have been extinguished; or, that her
sinking was the immediate consequence of a leak, which might
by ordinary care have been stopped ; as to say, that in this case,
the destruction by worms was the inevitable consequence of
the damage sustained at the Cape de Verds.
With regard to any claim for a partial loss, none was shown,
amounting to the requisite average of five per cent ; and had
there been one, it was merged ii the subsequent total loss.

Mr Webster stated, that he could add nothing'to the full and
able argument of Mr Loring; and that he submitted the case
to the court upon that argument, without any observation upon
it from him.
Mr Justice M'LEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiffs brought an action of assumpsit, in the circuit
court from the district of Massachusetts, on a policy of insurance, dated the 29th of December 1827 ; whereby the defendants caused to be assured Josiah Bradlee & Co. for Thomas
Hazard, Jun. of New York, fifteen thousand dollars on the ship
Dawn and outfits, at and fiom New York to the Pacific ocean

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

and elsewhere, on a whaling voyage, during her stay and fishing, and until her return to New York, or port of discharge in
the United States.
The declaration contained various counts, stating a total loss
of the vessel, and a partial loss of the cargo ; aid also a partial
damage to the vessel by perils of the seas.
It appeared in evidence, that the vessel sailed the 29th of
December 1827, and on her outward passage struck upon a
rock at the Cape de Verd Islands, and knocked off a part of her
false keel, but proceeded on her voyage and continued cruising,
and encountered some heavy weather, until she was finally
compelled to return to the Sandwich Islands, where she arrived
in December 1829, in a leaky condition ;- and upon an examination by.competent surveyors, she was found to be so entirely
perforated by worms in her keel, stem and stern post, and some
of her'planks, as to be wholly innavigable ; and being incapable
of repair at .that place, she was condemned and sold. The
vessel had sustained an injury at the Cape de Verds, and she
put into the port of St Salvador ; at both of which places the
bottom of the ship was examined by swimmers.
On the trial, a bill of exceptions was taken by the plaintiff's
counsel, to certain instructions of the court to the jury, and the
case is brought before this court by writ of error:
The first instruction excepted to, is as follows. "The court
further charged, that in ascertaining what is to be understood as
a coppered ship, in applications for insurance on a voyage of
this nature, the terms of the application are to be understood
according to the ordinary sense and usage of those terms in the
place where the insurance is asked for and made; unless the
underwriter knows that a different sense and usage prevail in
the place in which the ship is then lying, and in which the
owner resides, and from which he writes asking for the insurance; or unless the underwriter has some other knowledge,
that the owner uses the words in a different sense and usage
from those which prevail in the place where the insurance is
asked for and made."
This instruction refers to the letter written by the plaintiff,
at New York, on the 22d of September 1827, to his agent in
Boston, requesting him to have the ship Dawn insured, and in
which letter he made the following statement respecting the

SUPREME COURT.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Cbmpany.]

ship. " This'is the same ship that you had insured for me in
Boston some years since. I will only observe, that I believe
her to be one of the strongest and best ships in the whale fishery; she has been newly coppered to light water mark, above
which she is sheathed with leather to the wales, &c."
A representation to obtain a'n insurance, whether it be made
in writing or by parol, is collateral to the policy; and as it must
always influence the judgment 6f the underwriters, in regard
to the risk, it must be substantially correct. It differs from an
express warranty, as that always makes a part of the policy,
and must be strictly and literally performed.
The rule prescribed by the circuit court, to govern the jury
in giving a construction to the representation in this case, was
founded upon the fact, supposed, admittpid or proved, that what
"is to be understood as a coppered ship at New York, would
not be so considered at Boston." And th;s presents the point
for consideration, whether the plaintiff, in making the representation, was bound by the usage of Boston, or of New York
where his letter was written and his ship was moored.
It is insisted, that Boston is the place where the contract
was made, and where effect was given to the representation;
and that, consequently, not only the contract, but the inducements which led to it, must be controlled by the usages of
Boston.
This is an important question in the law of insurance, and it
seems not to have been settled by any adjudication in this
country ; and n6ne has been cited from England. The plaintiff's counsel contends, that it is substantially a question of
seaworthiness, and should be governed by the same rule ; and
he refers to a decision in 4 Mason 439, as decisive of the point.
In that case an insurance was made in Boston, upon a British
vessel belonging to the port of Halifax in Nova Scotia, and
the court says, " if the Boston standard of seaworthiness should
essentially differ from that in Halifax, in respect to equipments
for a South Imerican voyage of this sort, it would be pressing
the argument very far to assert, that the vessel must rise to the
Boston standard before the policy could attach. Where a policy
is underwritten upon a foreign vessel, belonging to a foreign
countryj the underwriter must be taken" to have knowledge of
the common usages of trade in such country, as to the equip-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England-Mar. Ins. Company.]

ments of vessels of that class for the voyage on which she is
destined. He must be presumed to underwrile, upon the
ground that the vessel will be seaworthy in her equipments,
according to the general custom of the port, or at least5 of the
country to which she belongs."
In every policy there is an implied warranty of seaworthiness, and this is a condition precedent on the part of the insured.
The policy does not atiach, unless the vessel be " properly
manned and provided with all necessary stores, and in all respects fit for the intended voyage." The equipnent of the
vessel must depend upon the nature of the voyage; as a ship
might be seaworthy fir a voyage across the Atlantic, and not
'for a whaling voyage in the Pacific.
A representation might embrace all the facts of an implied
warranty of seaworthiness ; but this is wholly unnecessary,
and is seldom, if ever done. The representation is designed to
state the quality and condition of the ship, if that be the object
of insurance, so as to induce the underwriters to insure on reasonable terms ; and it is not limited to the facts necessary to
constitute seaworthiness.
A question of seaworthiness is determined by the usages of
the port where the vessel is fitted out, in reference to the destined voyage. But the facts stated in a representation may
go beyond those usages; and the insured is bound to the extent
of his communication, whether verbal or written. In the one
case, the law implies a definite and fixed responsibility ; in the
other, the liability depends upon the express declarations of
the insured.
If the representation in this case fall below the implied warra-nty of seaworthiness, it does not, in any degree, affect such
warranty ; it cannot, therefore, be considered as a substitute
for the implied seaworthiness of the ship, but as a representation which entered into the consideration of the underwriters,
when they fixed the premium of insurance.
The question then recurs, was the plaintiff bound, in describing the ship, to use the appropriate terms according to the
usage in Boston or in New York . It is said,:the- terms used
were calculated to mislead the underwriters, as they resided at
Boston ; and in insuring a " coppered ship," would of course
refer to a vessel which could be so appropriately called at Boston.

SUPREME COURT.
EHazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company.]

The writer of the letter is a resident of the city of New York;
his letter was written at that place ; and he described his vest
sel then in the harbour of that city. What terms would he
be supposed to use in giving this description ; those which are
peculiar to New York, or those which are peculiar to Boston ?
Can he be presumed to know the usages of Boston in this respect; and must he not be presumed to know those of New
York ?
In making a representation respecting his vessel, his mind
would not be directed to Boston, but (6-his ship then in the
harbour of New York ; and in describing her as a "coppered
ship," he would refer to the appropriate designation at New
York.
And would not the minds of the underwriters at Boston,
seeing that the letter was written at New York, and represented a vessel in the harbour of that city, be very naturally
directed to the sense in which the terms used were viewed in
that place. Would they not inquire, whether the words "copered sbip" mean the same thing at New York as at Boston.
in a case of seaworthiness, such is admitted to be the rule;
and if the representation be not a warranty of seaworthiness,
still does not the reason (f the rule apply in the one case as
forcibly as in the other.
The underwriters are presumed to know what constitutes
seaworthiness in a foreign port, and to act under this knowledge; and whymaytheynot, with equal propriety, be presumed
to know, on a representation, the usage at the place where the
vessel lies, and where she is described. It is but a presumed
knowledge of usage in both cases ; and which, in both cases,
musthave the same effect on the rights of the parties. If, therefore, the rule be applicable to a case of seaworthiness, it must
be equally so to a case of representation.
The underwriters are presumed to know the usages of foreign ports to which insured vessels are destined; also the
usages of trade, and the political condition of foreign nations.
Men who engage in this business, are seldom ignorant of the
risks they incur ; and it is their interest to make themselves
acquainted with the usages of the different ports of their own
country, and also those of foreign countries. This knowledge
is essentially connected with their ordinary business; and by

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England.Mar. Ins. Company.]

acting on the presumption that they possess it, no violence or
injustice is done to their interests.,
It would therefore seem to be reasonable to conclude that
the defendants, when they made the insurance, were not misled by the representation of the plaintiff.. That they must
have considered the ship to be described according to the New
York usage; such, at least, is the presumption which arises
from the facts, and in strict analogy to other cases. The circuit court therefore erred in their instruction to the jury, that'
the representation was to be construed by the usage in Boston.
The second instruction of the court to which exception was
taken is, "that although the terms of the letter applying for
insurance were not to be considered a technical warranty, yet,
if the coppering of the ship, as stated in the letter on which
the insurance was made, was substantially untrue and incorrect in a point material to the risk, such a misrepresentation
would discharge the underwriters, although the ship was partially coppered, and although the loss did not arise from any
deficiency in the coppering."
Taking this instruction as disconnected with the first one,
the principle asserted is undoubtedly correct. It is upon the
representation that the underwriters are enabled to calculate
the risk and fix the amount of the premium; and if any fact
material to the risk be misrepresented, either through fraud,
mistake or negligence, the policy is avoided. It is therefore
immaterial in what way the loss may arise, where there has
been such a misrepresentation as to make void the policy.
"The fourth instruction excepted to Will be next considered,
as it embraces the principle asserted in the third. The judge
charged, "that if the jury should find that in the Pacific ocean
worms ordinarily assail and enter the bottom of vessels, then
the loss of a vessel destroyed by worms would not be a loss
within the policy."
This is an important question, and it seems now for the first
time to be brought before this court.
In 1796 the case of Rhol v. Parr was tried, which involved
this question, before Lord Kenyon, and a-special jury, at nisi
prius, reported in I Espinasse 445. His lordship said that "it
appeared to him a question )f fact rather than of law, such as
the jury were competent to decide omi, from the opinion on the

SUPREME COURT.

subject. adopted by the urideiwriters anid merchants." And
" the jury found that it. was not a loss within the term of 'perils
of the sea' in policies of insurance, and of course that the plaintiff could iiot recover for a total loss."
There seemis to have been a general acquiescence in this
decision in.England, as it has never been overruled.
In the case of Arnold Martin and others v. The Salem
Ma'ine Insurance Company, reported in 2 Mass. Rep. 420,
the court expressly recognized the doctrine laid down in the
case of Rhol v. Parr. But this doctrine is controverted in the
case of Garrigues v. Coxe, 1 Binn. 596: and in Depeyster
v. The Commercial Insurance Company, 2 Caines's Rep. 90,
Mr Justice Livingston said that he did not "mean to be understood as subscribing to the nisi prius opinion of Lord Kenyon in
the case of Rhol v. Parr; that it was not necessary to decide in
the case whethe a loss by worms was within the policy'
It was well remarked by Lord Kenyon, that whether a destruction by worms be within the policy was a question of fact
rather than of law, and could be best ascertained by a jury
from the opinion of underwriters and merchants. This was a
nisi prius decision; but it gave such general satisfaction to both
merchants and underwriters and all others conkcerned, as never
to have been questioned in England. It was the establishment of a usage by the opinions of those most competent to
judge of its reasonableness and propriety ; and the approbation
which has since been given to it in England by acquiescence,
may well constitute it a rule in that country by which contracts
of insurance are governed. And independent of the fact of its
having been adopted by the supreme court of Massachusetts,
is not the decision entitled to great consideration in this country ? It comes from the same source from which the principles
of our commercial law are derived, and to some extent, the
forms of our commercial contracts. Would it not be reasonable
to suppose that these contracts are entered into with a knowledge of the rule by which they are construed in the most
commercial country, if our own courts had adopted no rule on
the subject? But in the present case, the opinion of Lord Kenyon having been adopted in Massachusetts, the rule must certainly apply to all contracts made and to be executed in that
state.

JANGARY TERM 1834.
[Hazard's Administrator v. New England Mar. Ins. Company ]

The court, in their instruction, did not lay down the rule
broadly, that a destruction by worms was not within the policy
but the jury were told, that if, "in the Pacific occan, worm
ordinarily assail and enter the bottoms of vessels, then the loss
of a vessel destroyed by worms, would not be a loss within the
policy." In other words, if the vessel was lost by an ordinary
occurrence in the Pacific ocean, it was a loss against which
the underwriters did not insure. In an enlarged sense, all
losses which occur from maritime adventures, may be said to
arise from the perils of the sea ; bui the underwriters are not
bound to this extent. They insure against losses from extraordinary occurrences o*l ; such as stress of weather, winds
and waves, lightning, tempests, rocks, &c. These are understood to be the "perils of the sea" referred to in the policy, and
not those ordinary perils which every vessel must encounter.
If worms 6rdinarily perforate every vessel which sails in
a certain sea; is not a risk of injury from them, as common
to every vessel which sails on that sea, 'as the ordinary wear
and decay of a vessel on otherseas! The progress of the injury
may be far more rapid in the one case than in the other; but
do they not both arise from causes peculiar to the different seas ;
and which affect, in the same way, all vessels that enter into
them? In one sea, the aggregation of marine substances which
attach to the bottom of the vessel may possibly produce a loss ;
in another, a loss may be more likely to occur through the
agency of worms. Can either of these losses be said to have
been produced by extraordinary occurrences ? Does not the
cause of the injury exist in each sea, though in different deglees: and against which it is as necessary to guard, as to
prevent the submersion of a ship, by having its seams well
closed.
In the form in which the instruction under consideration was
given, this court think there is no error. If it be desirable to
be insured against this active agent which infests southern
seas, it may be specially named in the policy.
The third instruction objected to is : " that if there was no
misrepresentation in regard to the ship, and she substantially
corresponded with the representation, still, if the injury which
occurred at the Cape de Verds were reparable, aXpd could have
been repaired there, or at St Salvador, or at any thler port at

which the vessel stopped in the course of the voyage; the master was bound to have caused such repairs to be made, if they
were material to prevent any loss. And if he omitted to make
such repairs, because he did not deem them necessary; and if,
by such neglect, alone, the subsequent loss of the ship by
worms was occasioned, the underwriters are not liable for any
such loss so occasioned."
If the loss by worms is not within the policy, as has already
been considered under the fourth instruction; it must at once be
seen, that the court did not err in giving this instruction. The
negligence or vigilance of the master could be of no importance,
under the circumstances, in regard to the liability of the underwriters.
The other instructions in the case, relate to the loss of the
vessel by worms, and the representation made by the plaintiff;
and as they do not raise any distinct point, which has not already been substantially considered, it is unnecessary to enter
into a special examination of them.
The judgment of the circuit court must be reversed, and the
cause remanded for further proceedings.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States, for the district
of Massachusetts, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this court, that the said circuit
court erred in instructing the jury, that in ascertaining what
is to be understood as a coppered ship, in applications for insurance on .a voyage of this nature, the terms of the application
are to be understood according to the ordinary sense and usage
of those terms, in the place where the insurance is asked for and
made, unless the underwriter knows that a different sense and
usage prevail in the place in which the ship is then lying, and
in which the owner resides, and from which he writes, asking
for the insurance ; or, unless the underwriter has some other
knowledge that the owner uses the words in a different sense
and usage from those which prevail in the place where the
insurance is asked for and made ; but there is no error in the
other instructions given by the said circuit court. Whereupon, it
is ordered and adjudged, that the judgment of the said circuit

court be, and the same is hereby reversed for this error ; and
that in all other respects the said judgment be, and the same
is hereby affirmed. And it is further ordered by this court,
that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the
said circuit court, with directions to award a venire facias de
novo ; and that further proceedings be had in said cause, according to right and jnstice, and in conformity to the opinion
of this court.
