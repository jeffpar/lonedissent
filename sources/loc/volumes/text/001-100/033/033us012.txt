SUPREME COURT.

BANK OF THE METROPOLIS, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR V. WILLIAM

JONES.
In the case of the Bank of the United States v. Dunn, 6 Peters 51, this court
decided that a subsequent indorser was not competent to prove facts which
would tend to discharge the prior indorser from the responsibility of his in-

dorsement. By the same rule, the drawer of the note is equally incompetent to prove facts which tend to discharge the indorser.
The officers of the bank htve no authority, as agents of the bank, to bind it by
assurances which would release the parties to a note from their obligations.
The principles of the case of the Bank of the United States v. Dunn, 6 Peters
51, affirmed.

IN error-to the circuit court of the United States for the county
of Washington, in the district of Columbia.
This was an action on a promissory note, drawn by Betty

H. Blake, executrix of J. H. Blake, for the sum of five thousand two hundred dollars, on the 27th of March 1822-in

favour of the defendant,, and by him indorsed to plaintiffs.
The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit, and the statute of limitation.
On the trial ot the cause before the circuit court. the following bill of exceptions was signed.
1"Be it remembered, that on the trial of
the above cause,
the plaintiff, in order to sustain the issue, gave in. evidence the
following promissory note, oti which the action was brought:
Washington City,* March 27, 1822. $5,200.
Sixty days
after date, I promise to pay to Dr William Jones, or order, five
thousand two hundred dollats, for value received, negotiable
at the Bank of the Metropolis.

above note is due, and that I am bound to pay whatever balance thereof is due, as far as I was originally bound as indorser.

"And the defendant admitted the indorsement thereon, as
well as the memorandum on the face thereof, to be in his hand

writing; and the plaintiff further proved that said note wis
regularly protested for non-payment, and notice thereof duly
given to the defendant, and the defendant waived before the
jury the defence upon the statute of limitation.
"Whereupon the defendant, to prove the issue on his part,
under the plea of non-assumpsit, produced Mrs Betty H. Blake,
the drawer of said note, to whom a release was executed by
defendant, exonerating her from any responsibility for the costs
in this suit, to the form of which release no objection was made.
The plaintiff objected to the competency of Mrs Betty H. Blake
to certify t6 any matters impeaching the original validity of
the said note, or of said indorsement, but the court overruled
-the exception, and permitted the said witness to be sworn and
examined."
The evidence of M's Blake was the following: "that, at
the time of the death of her husband, Doctor James H. Blake,
in the summer of 1819, there were several notes drawn by
him running in said Bank of the Metropolis, Pnd that said deceased was also indebted to other persons in various sums.
That, when the notary came with one of said notes to procure
payment from her, she, being the sole devisee and executrix
of the last will and testament of said deceased, objected to a
renewal. Witness sent to general Van Ness, who was at the
time the president of the said Bank of the Metropolis, and
whom her deceased husband; on his death bed, had recommended to her to consult. Witness informed him that she did
not wish to renew the notes, but he advised her to amalgamate the notes in bank. She informed him that she could not
ask any one to indorse for her ; that she would prefer having
the property sold, and the debts paid. She never heard general Van Ness say any thing upon the subject of the indorsements by the defendant until long after they were made. Her
conversation with general Van Ness was in relation to the indorsement by her son James; he was consulted by her as her
confidential friend and adviser. He advised her against selling the property, as it was very valuable and would increase
daily in value : that witness had better procure some friend to
indorse for her; that the security was so valuable the indorser
would incur no responsibility. He suggested &ier son James
as an indorser. She qaid he was not of age, and that she did

not wish him to commence the world incumbered with liabilities. He said it was immaterial; that the security was
so valuable, he could incur no risk. Under this impression,
and in consequence of this conversation, she procured her son
to indorse said note, and he continued on the. nota until he
left Washington in the autumn of 1820:. and she then mentioned to Dr Jones, the defendant, what general Van Ness had
advised and informed her; who, in consequence, became the
indorser, and so continued upon the renewal of said notes,
until the date of,the note in question. She gave a deed of
trust of certain property of James H. Blake, to secure the Metropolis Bank the amount of the note, which she has been
advised she had no authority to give, because she was not
authorized to give a preference to the Bank of the Metropolis
over other creditors, and she has repeatedly mentioned this
circumstance."
The counsel for the plaintiff moved the court to instruct the
jury, that this evidence was incdmpetent upon the trial of the
issue; but the court overruled the motion; and instructed the
jury that the evidence was competent and proper evidence for
their consideration on the trial.
To this overruling exception was taken, and the plaintiffs
prosecuted this writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr Coxe, for the plaintiff in error;
no counsel appeared for the defendant.
Mr Coxe submitted to the court that the principle of evidence involved in the case, was determined in the case of the
Bank of the United States v. Dunn, 6 Peters 51. The whole
question is, whether any testimony can be given by a party to
a note to invalidate it.
Mr Justice M'LEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
This cause was brought into this court, by writ of error to
the circuit court of Washington county, in the district of Columbia. In that court an action was commenced by the Bank
of the Metropolis against the defendant, on a promissory note

drawn by Betty 11. Blake, tOr the sum of five thousand two
hundred dollars, dated the 27th of March 1822, payable in sixty

[Bank of the Metropolis v. Jones.]

days, and negotiable at the Bank of the Metropolis, which note
was indorsed by the defendant to the bank.
The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit, and the statute of
limitations; but on the trial waved the latter plea.
The plaintiff proved the indorsement-of the defendant, that
the note was regularly protested for non payment, and due
notice given.
On the trial, Betty H. Blake, the drawer of the note, was
offered as a witness, after the defendant had executed to her a
release from any responsibility on account of the costs of the
suit, and the court permitted her to be sworn. Among other
things, this witness gave in evidence to the jury, "that
at the time of the death of her rusband, Doctor James H. Blake,
in the summer of 1819, there were several notes drawn by him
running in the Bank of the Metropolis, and that he was also
indebted to other persons in various sums. That when the
notary came with one of said notes, to procure payment from
her, she being the sole devisee and executrix of the last will
and testament of said deceased, she objected to a renewal.
Witness sent to general Van Ness, who was at the time the
president of the Bank of the Metropolis, and whom her deceased husband, on his death bed, recommended her to consult.
She informed him that she did not wish to renew the notes,
but he advised her to amalgamate them in bank; that she informed him that she could not ask any one to indorse for her,
and would prefer having the property sold and the debts paid.
General Van Ness advised her against selling the property, as
it was very valuable, and would increase daily in value, and
that she had better procure some friend to indorse for her ; that
the indorser would incur no responsibility, as the property was

so valuable. In pursuance of this advice, she procured the indorsement of her son James, who was under age, and afterwards, when he had left the city of Washington, she procured
the defendant to indorse for her, on stating to him the advice
and informatioh given to her by general Van Ness." Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiffs moved the court to overrule
said evidence, and to instruct the jury that it was incompetent
upon the trial of the said issue; but the court refused to do so,
and they instructed the jury that the said evidence was com-

petent and proper for their consideration, to which opinion and
instructions of the court, a bill of exceptions was taken.
The principle involved in this case, is substantially the same
that was decided by this court in the case of the Bank of the
United States v. Dunn, 6 Peters 51. In that case the court
said, "it is a well settled principle, that no person who is a
party to a negotiable instrument, shall be permitted, by his
own testimony, to invalidate it." And this doctrine is sustained by reason and authority. If an individual whose name
appears upon the face of a negotiable instrument, either as
drawer, indorser or acceptor, shall be a Competent witness to
prove facts or circumstances which lessen or destroy its value,
before or at the time he gives it currency, the credit of commercial paper could not be sustained. The rule laid down in
1 Term Rep. 296, on this subject is a sound one; and was sanctioned by this court in the case above cited.
On the part of the defendant in error, it is contended, that the
witness objected to was not the only witness in the case; and
that her testimony was competent as far as it went. That
the court were not called on to decide whether the facts stated
by the witness were sufficient in law to discharge the defendant from his responsibility; but whether they conduced to prove
an imposition practised on him by the bank, which ought to
discharge him.
If the testimony of the witness impaired the obligation ot me
note, it was. inadmissible under the rule stated; and that this
was the tendency of the evidence, appears from the facts stated
and the argument just noticed. In the case cited, of the Bank
of the. United States v. Dunn, this court decided that Carr,
who was an indorser after Dunn, was not competent to prove
facts which would tend to discharge Dunn from the responsi-'
bility of his indorsement. And is it not clear, by the same rule,
that in the case under consideration, the drawer of the note is
equally incompetent to prove facts which tend to discharge the
indorser ?
In both cases the cischarge of tne inidorser was urged on
the ground that certain statements had been made by the officers of the bank, whi~h induced the indorser to sign the paper,
under a belief that by doing so he incurred no responsibility.
As the-ground'already stated is clear, it is unnecessary to add,

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the Metropolis v. ones.]

in this case, as was stated by the court in the case of Dunn,
that the officers of the bank had no authority, as agents of the
bank, to bind it by the assurances which they gave.
The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause
remanded for further proceedings.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington,
and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is
ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the
said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby
reversed; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings to be
had therein, according to law and justice, and in conformity to
the opinion of this court.
