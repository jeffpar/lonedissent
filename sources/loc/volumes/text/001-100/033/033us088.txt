SUPREME COURT.

JANE WATSON

AND

OTHERS, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR V. JOHN

MERCER AND MARGARET MERCER.
In 1785 M. and wife executed a dedd conveying certain lands of the wife to
T., who immediately reconveyed them to M. The object of the conveyance was to vest the lands of the wife in the husband. The deed of M. and
wife to T. was not acknowledged according to the forms established by the
law of Pennsylvania of 20th February 1770, to pass the estates of femes
covert; and after the death of the wife of M., the land was recovered inan
ejectment from the heirs of M. in a suit instituted against him by the heirs
of the wife of M. In 1826, after the recovery in ejectment, the legislature
of Pennsylvania passed an act, the object of which was, to cure all defective
acknowledgements of this sort, and to give them the same efficacy as if they
had been originally taken in the proper form. 'Ihe plaintiffs in the ejectment claimed title to the premises under James Mercer the husband; and
the defendants, as heirs at law of his wife, who died without issue. This
ejectment was brought after the passage of the act of 1826.
The authority of this court to examine the constitutionality of the act of 1826,
extends no farther than to ascertain, whether it violates the constitution of
the United States; the question, whether it violates the constitution of
Pennsylvania, is, upon the present yvrit of error, not before the court.
This court has no right to pronounce an act of the state legislature void, as
contrary to the constitution of the United States, from the mere fact that it
devests antecedent vested rights of property. The constitution of the
United States does not prohibit the states from passing retrospective laws
generally; but only ex post facto laws. It has been solemnly settled by this
court, that the phrase, ex post facto laws, is not applicable to civil laws,but
to penal and criminal laws; which punish no party for acts antecedently
done which were not punishable at all, or not punishable to the extent or in
the manner prescribed. Ex post facto laws relate to penal and criminal
proceedings which impose punishments or forfeitures; and not to civil proc .edings which affect private rights retrospectively.
The act of 1826 does not violate the obligation of any contract, either in its
terms or its principles. It does not even affect to touch any title acquired
by a patent or any other grant. It supposes the titles of the femes covert
to be good, however acquired: and even provides that deeds of conveyance
made by them shall not be void, because there is a defective acknowledgement of the deeds, by which they have sought to transfer their title. So far
then as it has any legal operation, it goes to confirm and not to impair the
contract of the fames covert. It gives the very effect to their acts and contracts which they intended to give; and which, from mistake or accident,
has not been effected.
The cases Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. Rep. 386,1 Cond. Rep. 172; Fletcher v.
Peck, 5 Cranch's Rep. 138, 2 Cond. Rep. 308; Ogden v. Saunders, 12
Wheat. Rep. 26, 6 Cond. Rep. 523; and Satterlee v. Matthowson, 2 Peters's
Rep. 380, fully recognize this doctrine.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

ERROR to the supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania.
In 1826, the defendants in error, John Mercer and Margaret
Mercer, instituted an action of ejectment in the district court
of the city and county of Lancaster, against Jane Watson and'
others, the plaintiffs in error, for the recovery of a tract of land
in Lancaster county, and'a verdict and judgment, under the
charge of the'court in favour of the plaintiffs, were rendered in
their favour.
The plaintiffs prosecuted a writ of error to the supreme court
of Pennsylvania, and in 1832 that court affirmed the judgment
of the ditrict court.
The land in controversy was part of a tract held under a
patent granted by the proprietaries of Pennsylvania to Samuel
Patterson on the 19th October 1743; and by regular descent
became vested in. Margaret Patterson, the .daughter of the
patentee, who afterwards intermarried with James Mercer;
who had five children by a former wife, now represented by
the defendants in error.
For the purpose of vesting the land in controversy in her
husband in fee simple, Margaret Mercer on the 30th May
1785, together with her husband, James Mercer, executed a
conveyance thereof to a certain Nathan Thompson, who on
the same day reconveyed the said land to James Mercer in fee.
This deed was not acknowledged by Margaret Mercer according to the forms prescribed by the rict of assembly of Pennsylvania of 1770, enacted for the purpose of making the coiiveyances of real estate by femes covert valid.
After the death of Margaret Mercer in 1805, David Watson,
in right of his wife, the heir at law of Margaret Mercer, to
whom, if the conveyance of 30th May 1785 was invalid, the
land in controversy hao descended ; instituted an ejectment for
the same, alleging that the acknowledgement of the deed being
defective, the same was absolutely void. In this iuit Watson
and wife recovered the premises, and went into possession
thereof. Afterwards John and Margaret Mercer instituted an
ejectment against Watson, then in possession of the premises,
and in 1823 that suit was decided in the supreme court of
Pennsylvania in favour of the defendants in the ejectment;
thus affirming the decision in the first case.
VOL. V1H.--M

SUPREME COURT
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

On the 3d day of April 1826 the legislature of Pennsylvania
made the following law.
"A supplement to an act entitled ' an act for the better confirmation of the estates of persons holding or claiming under
feme coverts, and for establishing a mode in which husband
and wife may hereafter convey their estates.'
"Whereas, by the act of assembly, to which this is a supplement, it is enacted that the estates of feme coverts may be
ti&ansferred by deed executed by the husband and wife, and
by them acknowledged before certain officers: And whereas,
under this act, estates of great value have been bona fide sold
by husband and wife for a legal and sufficient consideration,
and the deeds therefor have been by them acknowledged before the proper officer; but, in many cases, the mode of making
such acknowledgement hath been imperfectly set forth in the
certificate: And it hath been held by the supreme court, that
deeds transferring the rights and interests of feme coverts are
invalid and void, unless certain requisites of the acknowledgement of such. deeds provided by the said act, shall appear upon
the face of the certificate of such acknowledgement to have
been pursued, and in all such cases it is but just and reasonable
that persons who hold such estates, shouldnot, in any case, be
disturbed in the enjoyment of them thus equitably acquired,
nor divested thereof under any pretence whatsoever: Now, for
the purpose of carrying into effect the real intent of the parties,
and of quieting and securing the estates so transferred,
"Section 1. Be it enacted, by the senate and house of representatives, of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in general
assembly met, and it is hereby enacted, by the authority of
the same, That no grant, bargain, sale, feoffrnent, deed of conveyance, lease, release, or other assurance of any lands, tenements and hereditaments whatsoever, heretofore bona fide
made and executed by husband and wife, and acknowledged
by them before some judge, justice of the peace, or other officer
authorized by law within this state, or an officer in one of the
United States, to take such acknowledgement, orwhich may
be so made, executed and acknowledged as aforesaid, before
the. st day of September next, shall be deemed, held, or adjudged invalid, or defective, or insufficient in law, or avoided
or prejudiced by reason of any informality or omission in set.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

ting forth the particulars of the acknowledgement made before
such officer as aforesaid, in the certificate thereof, but all and
every such grant, bargain and sale, feoffment, deed of conveyance, lease, release, or other assurance so made, executed, and
acknowledged as aforesaid, shall be as good, valid, and effectual in law, for transferring, passing, and conveying the estate,
right, title and interest of such husband and wife, of, in, and to
the lands, tenements, and hereditaments mentioned in the same,
as if all the requisites and particulars of such acknowledgement mentioned in the act to which this is supplementary,
were particularly set forth in the certificate thereof, or appeared
upon the face of the same."
In 1829, the defendants in error, John and Margaret Mercer,
instituted another ejectment for the land, claiming, that the
deed of 30th of May 1785 had been made valid by the act of
assembly of 1826, and a verdict for the plaintiff was rendered
in the district court of the city and county of Lancaster, the
judgment of which court upon the verdict was affirmed in the
supreme court of Pennsylvania. From that judgment of the
supreme court, the case came before this court by writ of error.
The case was presented to the court on printed arguments,
by Mr Hopkins and Mr Montgomery for the plaintiffs in error,
and by Mr Rogers for the defendants. As the court decided
no other points but those in which the constitutionality of the
act of 1826 was presented, the arguments upon the other
questions raised in the case are omitted.
The counsel for the plaintiffs in error contended,
1. That, under the laws and constitution of Pennsylvania,
and the constitution of the United States, the title and possession of the plaintiffs in error to the land in dispute was sacred,
and could be disturbed or violated by no judicial proceedings
known to the said laws and constitutions; and, a fortiori, by
no legislative enactment.
2. That the act of 3d April 1826, as applied to this case, is
unconstitutional and void; divest: g the vested rights of the
plaintiffs in error to the property in dispute, and impairing the
obligation of the contracts under which they recovered and
held the same; transcending the power of the legislative branch

SUPREME- COURT.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

of government; and subverting all the protection, guarantied
to property and contracts by the constitution of the United
States, as well as of the state of Pennsylvania.
For the plaintiffs in error, it was argued by Mr Montgomery,
that the legislature of Pennsylvania could not, by the act of
April 3d 1806, divest the property of the Watsons and vest it
in the Mercers. For if this act be construed to be applied to
this case, and be considered as a constitutional exercise of legislative power, this will be the inevitable result.
The grant of the proprietaries to Samuel Patterson on the
19th October 1753, was recognised by the legislature on the
27th November 1779, and the act of that date, 1 Smith 479481, confirming the tile of the grantees, amounted to a new
grant and a contract, that Samuel Patterson should hold the
land thus acquired to him, his heirs and assigns; and the obligation of this contract was, as he had fully paid for the estate,
that he should hold it according to the laws of the land, and
not be divested of it, except by due course of law. The legislature would have had no right to resume it, or grant it to
another. Terret v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 292; Pawlet v. Clark,
4 Wheaton 683; Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87; New Jersey
v. Taylor, 7 Crai'eh 164. Ahd surely, what they cannot do
directly, they will not be permitted to accomplish by indirect
means. Sarah Watson recovered, in the suits of 1805, by virtue of the obligation of this coitract, as contained in the grant.
The land was withheld from her; she applied for redress to the
judicial power, whose duty it was to expound, administer and
enforce the law, Ogden v. Blackledge, 2 Cranch 272; and
she recovered her estate. Why? Because she had a vested
right to it. A vested right is defined to be "the power to do
certain actions, or possess certain things according to the laws
of the land." 1 Adams (New Hampshire) 203; 12 S. and
R. 360. Immediately upon the death of her sister, the right
descended to her, and it became eo instante, vested in her.
Whence was it derived ? From the patent, and from its confirmation by the act of the legislature in 1779. This was a
contract executed; and it is respectfully urged, that in Pennsylvania, there can be no vested right to land, that is not derived from contract. The whole system of land titles in Pennsylvania rests on this basis, and there is no trace of any title

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

in that state, which did not originate in a grant, 12 S. and R.
371-3, 380; or was perfected by patent, after having incepted
by improvement.
And no vested right can be taken away or interfered with,
except by impairing the obligation of the contract on which
it is based, and whence it springs.
Can it be doubted that this was a vested right? Why the
very terms of the definition embrace it, even to the letter. In
the action of ejectment, the plaintiff must show a right of
entry. Sarah Watson proved she had "the power to da this
thing." But the plaintiff must prove that he has a right to
the possession. Sarah Watson proved that she had a right
"to possess this land according to the laws bf the land." Can
any case come more completely within the very letter of the
definition. The act of 3d April 1826 surely cannot be retrospectively construed, so as to embrace this case; for such a
construction would make the law odious and void; 2 Dall.

But is it applicable to it at all? . The deed of 30th May 1785,
had been judicially declared to be a void thing, utterly inoperative ; and, consequently, incapable of any confirmation.

enforced against Margaret Mercer, in equity; 5 Day 492;
7 Conn. 224. The Mercers had failed in their ejectments,
not from want of proof of the due execution of the deed of
30th May 1715, as it seems to be supposed by the chief justice,
but because that deed was utterly and absolutely void; and
this will be found to have been the express decision in every
case in which the point was mooted. The act of 24th February 1770 imposed a high judicial duty on the examining
iagistrate; and, where it was not performed by him accord-

SUPREME COURT.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

ing to the directions of the statute, the contract was held
utterly void; not because the " grantee had failed in proof of
its execution," but because the grantor, the feme covert, was
utterly incapable of making any contract, oi- doing any act,
except in the mode directed by the statute. 1 Binney 470;
2 Inst. 515; 2 Kent's Com. 168.
How pan the act of 3d of April 1826, operate upon it at all?
If by way of confirmation, then it forms a new rule for a past
case, and transcends the legislative power
2 Cranch 272.
Nay, it does more; for Margaret Mercer, if living, could by no
act re-create this deed, so as to give it validity from its date.
16 John. 110; 20 John. 301; 4 Binney 1. It is calledan
explanatory act; but if it be true that it introduces a new
rule of construction, then it is, quoad hoc, a repeal of the
law of 1770; for it is an undeniable principle that, where
a subsequent statute makes a different provision on the same
subject, it is not an explanatory act, but an implied repeal of
the former, 7 John. 496, 497 ; and if it be a repeal of the act
of 1770, it can have no effect in divesting rights acquired under
the former act. 8 Wheaton 493. So that, quacunque via
data, this case ought not to be held to be embraced by it. It
is, therefore, respectfully submitted, that these cases are not
embraced by the act of 3d'of April 1826; and that, by applying and making it the ground of their judgment, the supreme
court of Pennsylvania have given it a construction which makes
it void, so far as regards them ; for it is in direct opposition to
the first article of the tenth section of the constitution of the
United States, which prohibits any state from passing an "ex
post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts."
A law may be constitutional in its application to some cases,
and void as to others. 3 W. C. C. R. 318, 319 ; 12 Wheaton
261, 262, 299, 302, 304, 327 ; and all the judges of this court,
it is believed, have so held. Indeed, it seems to have been
conceded by all, in the great case of Ogden v. Saunders, that
retrospective legislation, operating upon past contracts, so as to
impair their obligation, would be unconstitutional and void.
It was so held in Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheaton 122;
M'Millan v. M'Neill, 4 Wheaton 209; Smith v. Mechanics'
Bank, 6 Wheaton 131 ; Dartmouth College case, 4 Wheaton
613. Now, the act of 3d April 1826 can enibrace this case

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

only by a retrospective operation; and the question then arises,
does it not impair the obligation of a contract, within the
meaning of the constitution of the United States?1 The extent
of the change made in the contract, or the evidence of it, does
not vary the principle. 8 Wheaton 84, 75, 76 ; 12 Wheaton
327. A change in the evidence, if it go to defeat a right already vested under the contract, would equally impair its obligation. It surely could not be-contended that a will of lands,
not executed according to the statute, could, by a repeal of it,
or a change so as to make it conformable to the very case supposed, be made valid and operative, so as to defeat the estate of
the heir, acquired and vested by descent. Similar illustrations
of the principle are given by all the learned judges who delivered opinions in the case of Ogden v. Saunders; and a most apt
one upon the statute of limitations, by the chief justice, in
Sturges v. Crowninshield.
It has been attempted, and, with great confidence it is submitted, with success, to prove that Sarah Watson could never
have recovered this land but by force of a vested right acquired
by contract ; and that in the same way her grandchildren successfully resisted the claim of the defendants, and obtained a
final judgment against them, on 3d of June 1820. If this act
be construed to apply to this case, the inevitable consequence
is, that it divests this right thus vested under the contracts,
impairs, nay destroys, its obligation, and takes the property
from them to give it to the Mercars, whom the supreme court
twice decided had no title or even the shadow of claim. But
it is said the effect of this act is to affirm, and not destrby a
contract, and that thiscircumstance brings the case fully within
the principle of Satterlee v. Matthewson, decided by this
court. 2 Peters 380. Now, according to the distinction taken
in Ogden v. Saunders, between a contract and its obligation,
it is manifest that the contract between Satterlee and Matthewson was valid as between themselves, although the municipal law gave it no obligation. Each party was competent
to make a contract, for each was sui juris ; and the contract in
that case was betwveen the very parties to the suit. In this
case, Margaret Mercer was wholly incompetent to make any
contract. She was not sui juris, but wholly sub potestate viri ;,
and every thing she did was merely void. , I Black. Com. 444;

SUPREME COURT.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

Litt. see. 669, 670. She would not, and could not, have been
affected by this deed after her coverture ceased. 5 Day 492..
But again : this is an attempt to set up a contract, not between the parties to this suit, but between strangers. What
connexion is there, or ever was there, between Sarah Watson
and Nathan Thompson, from whom James Mercer derived title
immediately; or between her and James Mercer, who conveyed
to Thompson ? They are strangers in blood and estate. So
that there is, itis believed, no analogy between the cases whatever. But there is another all-powerful distinction between
that case and this, which must wholly refute the argument
drawn from this source. No final judgment ever was rendered
in that case; a venire de novo was awarded after the reversal
of the judgment ; and it would have been perfectly competent
to the court to have corrected the error of the first decision :
and so the act of assembly was not essential to the validity of
the claim of Mrs Matthewson. But here, if the Mercers recovered at all it is by mere force of the act of 3d April 1826.
It is a perversion of terms to'say that Satterlee acquired a
vested right bythe decision made in 1825; for no final judgment
was rendered in the case at all. But how different the cause
now under consideration. Here the heir recovered by virtue of
her vested right under the contract, and was put in possession of
the land;. the mesne profits were adjudged her as a compensation for her loss, and she was remitted to her original estate, so as
to make her title, by operation of law and lapse of time, valid
against the whole world. Her grandchildren had defeated the
very persons now suing, and, by obtaining the judgment on 3d of
June 1820, acquired an additional protection from the statutory provisions of the act of the 13th April 1807.
But further: the effect of the judgment in Satterlee's'casewas
not to impair the patent to Wharton under which he claimed:
itwas left in full force, so as to afford him every remedy towhich,
at law, he was entitled. All that the decision of the act of assembly did, was to prevent a particular defence that affected merely
the right of possession to the land in that action, without touching the titles of the respective parties at all. How different is
this case. Here are no conflicting patents : if thesejudgments
be affirmed, the consequence inevitably is, that the estate goes
from the blood of Samuel Patterson and passes to strangers.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

What boots it if the patent be available against the state, if

they have the power to take the land f'rom the heirs of the
original grantee, who paid for it, and give it to strangers ?
Of what avail is it that courts may recognize, and protect and
enforce contracts, and the rights that spring from them, if the
legislature may, at pleasure, thus impair them ? The act in
question may be a perfectly ptoper and legitimate exertion of
legislative powbr, if construed so as to protect the rights in,
tended to be secured by it. But if the construction put upon
'it by the supreme court of Pennsylvania be sustained, then it
is an act of legislative power far tnuscending even the boasted
omnipotence of the British parliament. It breaks down all the
security of property derived from contract, and resolves every,
mans title into a tenure at legislative will ; it overturns solemiti
decisions of the courts o 'the last resort, by which eventhese
courts themselves were so bound that t!hey could not fail to
obey them ; and it leaves eycry thing relating to personal rights
or private property, not under the protection of the constitution,
where the people placed it, to be expounded by the judiciary,
but in the variable and ever changing mind of the popular
branch of the government.
The repeal of laws, the abrogation of treaties, even the disruption of empires, have hitherto been held not to affect private
rights previously acquired and 'vested; but if the doctrine
advanced in Mercer v. Watson be sustained, all these solemnly
settled principles are overturned, apd a simple legislative enactment, is enabled to do that whicli the most violent revolutions
have hitherto ,been unable to effect ; and rights heretofore copsidered as sacred as justice herself, are all consigned to popular
will and popular excitements.
. It is, therefore, sespectfully submitted that the judgments of
the supreme court of Pennsylvania must be reversed, because
they give to the act of the 3d of April 1896, a construction
,which, so far as regards this case, makes it manifestly unconstitutional and'void: for it divests vested rights acquired by
contract ; destroys the obligation of the contracts under which
the Watsons held, and gives their estate to the Mercers in a
way that-even Margaret Mercer herself could not do-for she
could never. have, re-created this deed so as to make it operate
from its date; subverts the judicial power; makes itsubservient
VOL. VI1I.-N

SUPREME COURT.
(Watson and others v. Mercer.]

to the legislative will, and directly contravenes the tenth section of the first article of t4e constitution of the United States;
which, according to the construction given to it by this court,
shields and protects, all cooltracts, executed and executory, real
and personal, from the infl6ence of state legislation that impairs
their obligation.
Mr Rogers, for the defendants in error, argued:
1. That the act of Sd of April is not an ex post facto law,
nor law impairing the obligation of a contract, either express
or implied. And in this particular, it has nothing to do with
the constitution of the United States.,
2. That the act in question is an explanatory law, altering
a rule of evidence merely. It does not divest titles, nor divest
vested .rights; and it is not unconstitutional, if it did.
The considerations of these two propositions will meet the
argument of the plaintiffs in error, before the supreme court of
Pennsylvania, and, it is presumed, will equally answer that
purpose here.
The act of the 3d of April 1826, is retrospective in its operation, and so designed by its framers. It is not for this cause
unconstitutional. The power of a legislature to pass retrospective laws, is no where taken away, or prohibited by the constitution of the United States. It is true, a state cannot pass an
ex post facto lair which is a retrospective criminal law, but it
can a retrospective civil law. Expressum facit cessare taciturn,
says a maxim of the law.
This power of passing retrospective laws by a state, has been
repeatedly decided to be constitutional in Pennsylvania. See
Underwood v. Lilly, 10 S. and R. 97; Barnbaugh v. Barnbaugh, 11 Serg. and R. 72. So also, in tlr supreme court of
the United States, in Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Peters 380.
The same principle was decided in Pennsylvania and is reported in J5 Serg. and R. 72 ; which, in the supreme court of
the United States,. was quoted as authority in the case of Nicholson's hieirs and others, reported in 7 Peters 469.
The act in question is constitutional, unless it is an ex post

facto law, or law impairing the obligation of a contract. Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Peters 580. It is not an ex post
facto law, because such a law relates to criminal matters alone.

Calder v. Bull, -3 Dallas 386, 396 ; Fletcher v. Peck, 6
Cranch 138; Commonwealth v. Lewis, 6 Binney 271.
Then, does the act violate'a contract . What is a contract?
It is an agreement between two or more parties to do or not to
do ce rtain acts.
The contracts embraced by the clause in the constitution
referred to, the first clause of tenth article, include those which
are executed, such as grants, and such as are executory,'and
this, whether between individuals only, or between a state and
individuals. This position is abundantly decided in Fletcher
v. Peck, 6 Cranch 136; Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheaton 1, 92;
Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Peters 514.
The clause embraces no other contracts 6xcept thosa "or
property, or some object of value. See case of Dartmouth College, 4 Wheaton 637, 644. It did not embrace any other
contracts than express. Implied contracts are excluded; except, perhaps, indeed, such, as are implied from the nature or

taken by the supreme court in the case of Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Peters 280. Judge Baldwin says, "Where there is nor
express contract, courts will not create a contract by implication."
But where is the contract impaired by this act of the legiglature of Pennsylvania ? It is contended there is none, either
express or implied. If so,where is it ? , How does it arise, and
who are the parties to it?. The inquiry is important, because the
party complaining must show it. It is not sufficient to allege,
that the constitution has been violated. Courts will not declare
laws unconstitutional for light or trivial causes. "This
power," says chief justice Tilghman, 3 Serg. and R. 73, "'is
a power of high responsibility, and not to be exercised but in
cases free from doubt."
But the iuquiry is important in another sense ; because, if
the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania divests rights which
are vested by law in an individual, if it does not violate a contract, it has nothing to do with the constitution of the United
States. 2 Peters 380.
The error assigned in substance says, "th contract commenced with"the patent in 1743 by the proprietors to Samuel
Patterson ; descended by the laws of intestacy from generation

•SUPREME COURT.

to generation, and was finally confirmed by the decision of
the supreme court."
1st. It is contended that the patent is impaired by this law ?
Did the state attempt to resume the grant, as in Fletcher and
Peck ? Does the question arise between the state, and Patterson or his alienee ? Did he sell? The land on the contrary
is derived under the patent, by both parties, andnot in contradiction to it. , It operates upon a state of things long subsequent
to Patterson's death ; upon a contest between the children.
See 3 Peters 280.
2d. Did the common law, or the statutes of descent, as the
gentlemen call them, create a contract between the feme and
her heir -at law, that if she died intestate, the heir should
have the property? Does the common law, where a feme covert
attempted, though imperfecdly,-to transfer her property, and a
legislature made the attempt valid, declare that t -is legislative
act violated a contract between the heir and feme heir at law ?
Was such a contract contemplated b the clause in the constitution ? Is such tt contract express or implied ?
3d. Did the act of 20th February 1.770, create any contract
which is violated by the legislative act of 1826? This is not
even pretended.
4th. Then, did the supreme court in 1809 (Watson and
Bailey), when, as the plaintiffs in error say, they declared the
deed of the 30th of May 1785 void, create- contract which is
violated by this act ? According to this argument, the court,
in this case, first destroy one -ontract, and then make another
between different parties.
But, admit for one moment, that the deed was void, and as
such declared by the court. 'This act of 1826 did not impair it.
The legislature, say they, make a void deed a valid one : that
is, set up a new contract between the parties. Didthey violate
the contract ? There is a difference between making a new
contract between parties, and impairing one. 2 Peters 412,
413.
But was the deed declared void by the court? This position
is the basis of all the argument of the plaintiffs in error, and if
you remove the foundation, the superstructure must fall also.
The supreme court in- 1809, did'not say so. 1 Binney 480.
Judge Yeates concludes by saying, "I am therefore of opinion,

JANUARYTERM 1834.
(Watson and others v. Mercer.]

that this deed had no legal effect against the heir at law, after
the death of the wife." Here it is admitted that the deed was
good, during the life of the wife-not void ab initio. It failed
of legal effect; says the court ; and how did it fail ? Because
the deed was not sufficiently proven, not that it was void.
The court held the certificate of the judge to be conclusive; and as, on its examination, it did not appear that the
contents were made known, and the act of signing to have
been her voluntary act, the deed was not received as evidence
of title. And parol declarations of the wife, repeatedly riade,
were rejected as evidence, to supply the necessary proof ot Lhe
acknowledgement.
There is anoiher view of this case peculirly applicable in
this stage of the argument.
This deed of the 30th of May 1783, was a good and valid
deed at common law, that is, the common law of Pennsylvania.
See Davey v. Turner, I Dallas I I; and Lloyd v. Taylor, I
Dallas 18. These cases decide, on the principle of comnmunis
error facit jus. That a deed signed by husband and wife,
whether she was examined separate and apart, or whether the
deed was even acknowledged at all ; yet it conveyed the interest of the.parties.
These cases furnish, if nothing more, ample corroboration of
the truth and correctness of the view taken by the chief justice
of Pennsylvania, in this cause, in which lie considers the act
of 1826, not as a law impairing a contract, but as carrying
a contract into effect. Thus validating the deed of the 30th
of May 1785, by the 'substitution of the intention, and carrying
it into operation.
Upon the second proposition of the defendants in ei:ror, Mr
Rogers contended, that the law of 1826 is an. explanatory- law
altering a rule of evidence. This is the first part of the proposition which is primarily to be examined.
The act'of the 24th of February 1770, for which see Purdon's Digest 164, 165; .and Dallas's Laws 535 ; and 1 Smith
307, points out the mode of the acknowledgement, &c. The
court, in putting a constvuction upon this act, construed it
strictly. Deciding that the evidence, and only evidence of the
acknowledgement, being in accordance with the act, was the
certificate of the judge. I Binney 470. So that it mattered

SUPREME COURT.
[Watson and others v. Merqer.]

not how honest the intention to convey, and fair the transaction
between the parties ; nor whether the judge conformed 'to the
requisitions of the act in point of fact : yet if he did not certify
all the particulars, the deed could not be received. Thus violating the maxim omnia presumuntur rite esse acta.
The act of the 3d-of April 1826, which in its title is supplementary to the act of the 24th of February 1770, altered the
rule thus established by the court ; by making the intention of
the parties the legitimate subject of inquiry before courts of
justice. The question then was, was the deed bona fide made
and executed by the husband and wife, and acknowledged
before some judge, &c. If so, then if the acknowledgement
were informal in not setting forth all the particulars, it was
not for this cause invalid, but was cured by the act.
The deed thus acknowledged, bore on its face, when exhibited in a court of justice, prima facie evidence of the good faith
of the parties. That is, furnished a legal presumption in
favour of the deed. But the question is still left open for the
opposite party to show fraud or want of good faith.
Fraud was not alleged, or even pretended : but the opposite
was shown by the reasons for a new trial in 1809, brought forward by the Watsons themselves, The jury found in favour
of the deed a second time as already stated;. thus furnishing a
decision in point of fact and of law, in favour of Mercer.
The remaining part of the second proposition of the defendant in error, relates to the power of a state, by a legislative act,
to divest rights vested by law in an individual. And here it
is contended by the plaintiff in error, that the legislature of
Pennsylvania, by the passage of the act of 3d April 1826, infringed their vested rights to the land in dispute, which were
guarantied by the constitution of Pennsylvania and that of the
United States.
The question, whether a state law, repugnant to a state
constitution, is constitutional or not, is not cognizable by the
supreme court of the United States. It is exclusively confined
to the state courts. Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Peters 280.
As tothe power under the constitution of the United States,
of a state to take away from an individual his vested rights to
property, whatever doubt there'may have been before, since
the case~of Satterlee v. Metthewson. 2 Peters 380, the question

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

has been put at rest. Such a law, if it does not impair a contract, has nothing to 'do with the constitution of the United
States.
But the exercise of such a power, so far as it is applicable to
this case, is denied. The legislature did not divest the vested
rights of the Watsons.
Mr Hopkins, for the plaintiffs in error, contended, that the
act of April 3, 1826, was ex post facto in its operation, and
therefore void. The rights of the appellants were derived
under the patent from the proprietaries of Pennsylvania to
their ancestor; had been established by two verdicts in ejectment, and by the force of the thirteenth section of an act of
assembly of 1807; and the ejectment in this case was conclusively batred.
The section enacts, "whenever two verdicts shall, in any
writ of ejectment between the same parties, be given in succession for the plaintiff or defendant, and judgment be rendered
thereon, no new ejectment shall be, brought, but when there
may be verdict against verdict between the same parties, tnd
judgment thereon, a third ejectment, in such case, andverdict
and judgment thereon, shall be final and conclusive and bar
the right ; and the plea in ejectment shall be not guilty.
All these rights are, by the constitution of Pennsylvania, in
its ninth article, excepted out of the general powers of government, "that the general, great and essential principles of liberty and free government, may be reorganized and unalterably
established."
The first section declares, that all men have certain inherent
and indefeasible rights, amongst which are those of enjoying
life, and liberty of acquiring, possessing and protecting property.
The ninth section declares, that io one can be deprived of life,
'liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers, or the
law of the land. The sixth section provides for the due administration of justice; and the seventeenth section declares, no
ex post facto laws, nor any law impairing contracts shall be
made. And sections fifteen and eighteen protect personal
security. And section twenty-§ix declares, that every thing
in this article-is excepted out of the general power- '-fgovernment, and shall for ever remain inviolate.

SUPREME COURT.
(Watson and others v. Mercer.]

Absolute rights to property, are placed un.ler the safeguard
of the constitution, as completely and effectually as life and
liberty, and with equal justice; as life and liberty would be
dreary things to man, if he could not be secure in the enjoyment of his property, acquired by his honest industry, to make
life comfortable, andl liberty worth preserving.
The arrangement of personal security and private property
is much expanded, and differently cast in the constitution 'of
Pennsylvania, from that which exists in the constitution of the
United States. The fifteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and
nineteenth sections,. are, widely different in their airangement,
and designedly so, to afford to each their fullest operation, to
the whole extent of the expressions used. The imputations of
crime and punishment, are wisely and studiously separated
from those which expressly relate to civil rights, except when
the -protection to the latter would, in its generality, equally
embrace the former.
The seventeenth section associates ex post facto laws and
laws impairing contracts, and makes them, as to their objects,
one and indivisible; as it would be all but useless to preserve
civil rights from being impaired in the least degree, when the
contract itself would be destroyed by legislative enactment,.by
creating something to assail it, which did not exist before, or
by prescribing a rule of evidence which would recreate that
which had been condemned in judgment of law.
Our constitution is formed by the people, out of their original
inherent and elementary power enjoyed as a free people, seeking their security and happiness, against that despotism which
sometimes springs up in the turbulence and listlessness of the
best of governments. The words and phrases used are taken
in their most comprehensive sense, adapted to the common
understanding, excluding all technicality which would be unintelligible to ninety-nine out of a hundred of those who had
the deepest interest in the protection intended and given by it.
.Hence the expression. ex post facto law, is used in its original and general sense, to prevent all retrospective legislation,
and to make an act, which when done was innocent, criminal ; or a right, which when acquired was legal and just,
illegal and unjust. The other clause of the sentence in which
these expressions are found, necessarily imposes on this, from

JANUARY TERM 1834
(Watson and others v. Merer.j

itsconnection, the protection of civil rights. Noscitui' a sociis,
is a very just and rati6nal rule of exposition of the differeit
clauses of the same sentence, which, from the affiliation of its
parts, must be intended to embrace the subject matter of the
sentence, which was the protection of prQperty and person,
otherwise they would nbt'be so united. A complete: absolute
inviolability was. designed for both, which forbids restricting
the terms used from their general meaning.
Our courts, in conformity to this injunction and
ihterdiction
of the people, have uniformly construed acts of the legislature
prospectively, even when their language Would have borne a
different construction.
The late venerable Chief-Justice Tilghman, who united all
the virtues of , judge to an enlightened and profound knowledgeofbis professionbdeclares, "the rule hasbeen, that where
.civil rights are affected, the act shall be conined to a prospective operation.'
The same doctrine was uniformly sustained before, and
formed an impregna bla barrier against unconstitutional power
invading the constitutional rights of the-people. 4 S. and R.
401 ;A2 S.*andR. 380; "1Bin.. 60) ; 3 S. and R. 169, 590;
2 Dall. 312.
And even this very act, of the 3d of April 18g6, has been
adjudged, by. the unanimous, ppinion of the supreme cw~irt, to
operate prospectivelyj only wherecivil'rights are affected.
This uninterrupted.saries of decisions, sustaining the constitutional, rights ot Pennsylvania, had grown with her growth
-and strengthened with her strength, from the fiist foundation
-of the province, resting.on thebenign principles of the common
law.
In England, where the liberty and security of the subject
has no.other basis to rest upon-than the common law, retrospective legislation is uniformly rejected by her courts of justice: T. Jones's R. 108;" 2 Show. R. 27; 2 Mod. 310; 1 Ld.

VOL. vII.-o

SUPREME COURT.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

The same -rule has uniformly prevailed in the courts of the
United States, where it has ever been held, that no law'is to
be construed, so as to impair rights previously vested.
This interdiction, By judicial power, of retrospective legislation upon civil rights, on account of its tyrannous and despotic
character, might bb extensively shown in the judicial code of
most, if not of all our sister states, wherever it has been
attempted. But as the sovereign will of the people has ex-,
cepted this power out of the grant of legislative power, and
has declared, that our bill of rights, contained in the ninth
article of the constitution, shall for ever remain inviolate, its
Pennsylvania will not occur, while the constituextinction in.
tion is maintatined by our courts of justice.
The act of the 3d of April 1826, does not embrace our case.
This is a supplement to the act of the 24th of February 1770,
with which it must be construed to discover its meaning. The
original act is both confirmatory and declaratory. The mode
of conveying by man and wife,- had. been according to dertain
customs and usages, by which "a very-great number of bona
fide purchabers for a valuable consideration, were become the
just and equitable owners," and "to remove some doubts" about
the validity of such conveyances, the act confirms the title of
such purchasers. It stopped upon protecting bona fide purchasers for valuable consideration, who had become the just
and equitable owners; and left husbands, who used their situation tobecome the owners of their wives' property, where they
were. To that extent, communis error facit jus, would probably have supported the customh, because, at the early period.
of tha province, and until 1760, inchoate titles to land, such as
Warrants, locations, &b. not perfected by patents, were transferredby bill of sale as chattels,. The confirmatory part: of the
supplement, just goes the same length and no further. And
that was going much further than the former, where common
errdr made a strong case with the custom, and the unimproved
and uninformed state of the province, at that early period:
whereas the declaratory part of the original law, prescribed a
mode for the husband and wife to convey the estate, which
would prevent injury to purchasers bona fide and for full value,.
who were not guilty of gross neglect. The legislation in the
supplement,- set forth the object to be the same for its enact-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.]

ment as was declared in the original act; that estates of great
value have been bona-fide sold by husband and wife for a legal
and sufficient consideratio', and" that, in all such cases, the
persons who hold, should not be disturbed in the enjoyment of
them thus eqiitably acquired. This specific declaration of the
object and intent, could not, by any just rule of construction,
be expanded by the verbiage f the enactment to embrace this
case.
But if this act, of the 3d of April 1826, upon its. true construction, embraces this case, it is void by the constitution of
the state, and of the United States.
The title of the plaintiff In error, originates in the patent,
granted by the late proprietaries of Pennsylvania, for full value
to Samuel Patterson, their great grandfather, on the 19th of
October 1743, and is the highest 'contract known to the laws
of Pennsylvania, of title to real estate. The act of November
1779, which divested the proprietaries of their. estate in the
province, and vested it in the commonwealth, confirmed all
the grants and contracts made by them to individuals.
This title to the lands in dispute came by succession, through
several courses of descent, to Margaret Patterson, who married
James Mercer, And on her death, in his lifetime, without issue,
came by three successive descents, to the plaintiff in error,
under the act directing the descent of intestate's yeal estate,
passed. the 19th of April 1794. The first of these descents
was established by the judgment of the supreme court, in the
ejectment brought by David Watson and Sarah his wife, the
heir at law, against the executors of James Mercer, on the 31st
of December 1808, against the deed of the 30th of May 1785,
and the two last, by the judgment rendered on the 3d of June
1820, in the ejectment brought by John and Margaret Mercer,
against Samuel P. Watso'n, and on his death, continued against
his heirs, plaintiffs in error, against the said deed.
Margaret Mercer died before the 1st of February 1802, and
our recovery on the. descent, on the 31st of December1808,
remitted to us the possession, according to our title, againstthe deed of the 20th of May 1785, and we continued in possession until the 3d of April 1826-twenty-four years two
months and three day.

SUPREME COURT.
[Watson and others v. Mercer.

By the act of. the 26th of March 1785, twenty-one years, is
the limitation of actionsfor real estate in Pennsylvania.
By the twentieth section of the act of the 13th of April
1791, no writ of error can be brought to reverse-any judgonent,
given in any action, real; personal or mixed, after sev'en years.
By the fourth section of the act of the 13th of Apr l 1807,
after two verdict and 'judgments in succession, no new ejectment shall be broughit.
Under this statement.the following poipts are submitted:
1st. This is an ex post facto law, impairing the obligation
of tontracts: destroying and impairing our Vested rights under
the grant contained in this patent, both by the constitution of
Pennsylvania,. and of the United States.
2d. It is an ex post .facto act, impairing our vested rights,
which descended under the intestate law of the 19th of April
1794, by virtue*of the grant contained in the patent, and depriving the plaintiff in error of the protection of that law.
3d. The act is ex post facto, and impairs the vested right
derived to us under our patent, and the three descents cast
upon us, and confirnIed by the two judgments of the supreme
court, sustaining the said descents against the deed of the 30th
of May 1785, and adjudicating it to be void on points put to
the court, involving its validity, which judgments are conclusive evidence of said deed being no deed-and of our rights
acquired by the three descents being absolute vested rights.
Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a yrit of 'error to the supreme court of the state of
Pennsylvania, brought under the twentieth section of the judiciary act of 1789, chapter 20.
The original suit is an ejectment by the defendants in error
for certain-lands in Lancaster county in the state of Pennsylvania, upon which a final judgment was rendered in their
favour. The facts, so far as they are material to the q!estions
over which this court has ju'isdiction, are these. On the 8th
of May 1785, James Mercer and Margaret his wife executed a
deed of the premises, then being the property of the wife, to
Nathan Thompson in fee, who afterwards, on the same day:
reconveyed the same to James Mercer the husband, in fee;
the object of the-deeds being to vest the estate in the husband.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and others v. Mcrcer.]

The certificate of the acknowledgement of the deed of Mercer
and wife to Thompson by the magistrate who took the same,
does not set forth all the particulars as were required by the law
of Pennsylvania of the 24th of February 1770, respecting the
acknowledgement of deeds of fernes covert. The legislature
of Pennsylvania, on the 26th of April 1826, passed an act, the
object of which was, to cure all defective acknowledgementg of
this sort, and to give them the same efficacy 's if they had been
originally taken in the proper form. The plaintiffs in the ejectmentclaimed title to the premises under James Mercer the husband: and the defendants, as heirs at law of his wife; who died
without issue. The ejectment was brought after the passage of
the act of 1826.
In the case of the lessee of Watson and wife v. Bailey ([Binney 470), the acknowledgement of this very deed from Melcer
and wife to Thompson was held to be fatally defective to pass
her title. But the act of 1826 has been repeatedly held by the
supreme court of Peinsylvania, to be constitutional; and to give
validity to such defective acknowledgements. It was so-held
in Barnet v. Barnet (15 Serg. and R. 72), and Tate and Wife
v. Stooltzfoos (16 Serg. and R. 35): and again, upon solemn
deliberation and argument in the case now before this court.,
The object of the present writ of error is, to revise the opinions
thus pronounced by the highest state court.
Our authority to examine into the constitutionality of the act
of 1826, extends no farther than to ascertain, whether it violates
the constitution of the United States; for the question, whether
it violates the constitution of Pennsylvania, is, upon the present writ of errnr, not before us.
The act of 1826 provides, " that no grant, &c., deed of conveyance, &c., heretofore bona fide made and executed by husband and wife, and acknowledged by them before some judge,
&c., authorised by law, &c. to take such acknowledgement
as aforesaid, before the 1st day of feptember next, shall be
deemed, held, or adjudged, invalid or defective, or insufficient
in law, or avoided, or prejudiced, by reason of any informality
or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgement made before such officer as aforesaid, in the certificate
thereof ; but all and every such'grant, &c., deed of conveyance,
&c., so made, executed and acknowledged as aforesaid, shall be

the
face
of
upon -the
The argument for the plaintiffs in error is, first,, that theact
violates the constitution of the United States; -because itdevests
their vested rights as heirs at law of the premises in queition:
and secondly, that it violates the obligation of a contract, that
is, of the patent granted by the proprietaries of Pennsylvania
to Samuel Patterson, the ancestor of the original defendants,
from whom. they trace their title to the premises, by descent
through Margaret Mercer.
As to the first point, it is clear that this court has no right
to pronounce an act of the state legislature void, as contrary to
the constitution of the United States, from the mere fact that
it devests antecedent vested rights of property. The constitution of the United States does not prohibit the states from passing retrospectivelaws generally ; but only ex post facto laws.
Now it has been solemnly settled by this court, that the phrase,
ex post facto laws, is noi applicable to civil laws, but to penal.
and criminal laws, which punish no party for acts antecedently
.done which were not punishable at all, or not punishable to
the-extent or in the manneT prescribed. In short; ex post facto
laws relate to penal and criminal proceedings which impose
punishments or forfeitures, and not to civil proceedings which
affect. private rights retrospectively. The cases Calder v. Bull,
3 Dall. R. 386, 1 Cond. Rep. 172; Fletcher v. Peck, 5 Cranch's
R. 138,2 Cond. Rep. 308 Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheaton's
R. 266, 6 Cond. Rep. 523; and Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2
Peters's R. 380, fully recognize this doctrine.
In the next place, does, the act of 1826 violate the obligationl
of any contract f In our.judgment it certainly does not, either
in its terms or its principles. It does not even affect to touch
any title acquired by a patent or any other grant. It supposes
the ;titles of the femes covert to be good, however -acquired;
and only provides that deeds of conveyance made by them
shall not be void, because there is a defective-acknowledgement

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Watson and othors v. Mercer.]

of the deeds, by which they have sought to transfer their title.
So far then as it has any legal operation, it goes to confirm, and
not to impair the contract of the femes covert. It gives the
very effect to their acts and contracts which they intended to
give; and which, from mistake or accident, has not been,
effected. This point is so fully settled by the case of Satterlee
v, Matthewson, 2 Peters's R. 380, that it is wholly unnecessary
to go Qver the reasoning upon which it is founded.
Upon the whole,. it is the unanimous opinion of the couxt,
there is no error in the judgment of the supreme court of
Pennsylvania, so far as it is subject to the revision of this
court, and therefore it is affirmed with costs.
