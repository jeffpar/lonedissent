OF NEW YORK, PLAINTIFFS V. TnE HEIRS OF NICHOLAS
WILSON.
Mandamus. The district judge of Louisiana refused to sign the record of a
judgment rendered in a case, by his predecessor in office. By the law of
Louisiana, and the rule adopted by the district court, the judgment, without the signature of the judge, cannot be enforced. It is not a final judgment, on which a writ of error may issue, for its reversal. Without the
action of tho judge the plaintiffs can take no step in the case. They can
neither issue execution on the judgment, nor reverse the proceedings by
writ of error.
On a motion for a mandamus, the court hold: The district judge is mistaken
in supposing that no one but the judge who renders the judgment, can grant
a new trial. He, as the successor of his predecessor, can exercise the same
powers, and has a right to act on every case that remains undecided upon
the docket, as fully as his predecessor could have done. The court remains
the same, and the change of the incumbents cannot and ought not, in any
respect, to injure the rights of litigant parties. The judgment may be erroneous, but this is no reason why the judge should not sign it. Until his
signature be affixed to the judgment, no proceedings can be had for its reversal. He has, therefore, no right to withhold his signature, where, in the
exercise of his discretion, he does not let aside the judgment. The court,
therefore, directed, that a writ of mandamus be igsued, directing the district
judge to sign the judgment.
On a mandamus a superior court will never direct in what manner the discretion of an inferior tribunal shall be exercised, but they will, in a proper case,
require an inferior court to decide. But, so far as it regards the case under
consideration, the signature of the judge was not a matter of discretion.
It followed as a necessary consequence of the judgment, unless the judgment had been set aside by a new trial. The act of signing the judgment

error, a judge is required to sign a citation to the defendant in error; he is
required, in other cases, to do acts which are not strictly judicial.
The writ of mandamus is subject to the legal and equitable discretion of the
court, and it ought not to be issued in cases of doubtful right. But it is
the only adequate mode of relief, where an inferior tribunal refuses to act
upon a subject brought properly before it.
A motion for a new trial is always addressed to the discretion of the court, and
this Lourt will not control the exercise of that discretion by a circuit court,
either by a writ of mandamus or on a certificate of livibion between the
judges.

SUPREME COURT.
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

This case, as stated in the opinion of the court, was as follows.
This suit was conmmenced in the district court of the United
States for the eastern district of Louisiana, on the 26th of May
1826. The action was brought on a mortgage on real property and slaves, in the state of Louisiana, to secure the payment of a'large sum of money. And at the first term the
following judgment was entered. " In this case, the plaintiffs having filed in this court a transaction, entered into between the parties, before Greenbury Ridgley Stringer, Esq., a
notary public in and for the city of New Orleans, and the
same being read to the court, it is thereupon ordered, adjudged
and decreed, that, in pursuance of said transaction, judgment
be entered up in favour of the plaintiffs, for all the notes therein
specified, which have become due and payable, with seven
per cent interest thereon, from the time th -y and each of them
respectively airived at maturity, to wit; the sum o-,eleven
hundred dollars, due on the 18th of November 1824; the gum
of four thousand dollars, due on the 18th of January 1825
the sum of nine hundred and sixty dollars, due on the 18th
day of May 1825; the suim.of seven hundred and twenty-five
dollars, due on the 18th of November 1825; and the sum of
four thousand dollars, due on the 18th of January 1826. It
is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, in pursuance of the
transaction aforesaid, that whenever any of the notes mentioned in said transaction, as yet not arrived at maturity, shall
become due and payable, that then judgment shall be entered
up for the plaintiffs, upon all and every of the said notes, as
they arrive at maturity, with seven per cent interest, from the
time they become de and payable, until their final judgment.
It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that there shall
be a stay of execution on said judgment, until the 18th day
of January 1829 ; and that, if the amount of the judgment in
this suit, is not then paid, including principal, interest and
costs, on said day, that the said slaves and movable property,
"described in the mortgage mentioned in plaintiff's petition, shall
be sold according to law, to satisfy the judgment in the premises."
By the code of practice of Louisiana, sec. 3 and art. 546,
it is provided, that, "'the judge ntist sign all definitive or final

judgments rendered by him, but he shall not do s, antil three
judicial days have elapsed, to be computed from the nay when
such judgments were given."
In conformity with the practice of the state courts under
this law, it seems the district court of the United States in
Louisiana, has adopted a rule which requires all its judgments
to be signed. But the judge who rendered the above judgment,
departed this life before he signed it, and no proceedings were
had in the case until the 21st of May 1832, when a notice was
filed in the clerk's office, to the heirs of Wilson, that at. the next
term, application would be made to the district judge, on behalf of the plaintiffs, to sign the judgment. A motion to this
effect was made, Nhich was overruled by the.court.
At the last term of this court, a rule was granted on the
district judge, to show cause why a mandamus should not be
issued, commanding him to sign the judgment and direct execution. And, at the present term, the district judge, inobedience to the rule, gives the following reasons why he refused
to sign the judgment and award execution in the case.
"At the May term 1826, Judge Robinson caused the judgment to be entered. That he did not sign the judgment,
although he held three terms afterwards, and (lid not die until
in the autumn of 1828. And now the plaintiffs move, that 1,
as his successor, shall sign the judgnent, in order to render it
-executory.
"This application is resisted by the defendants, on several
grounds, but principally, 1st. Because they say there never
was any legal judgment given: and secondly, that the record
of the proceedings does not exhibit such a case as entitled the
plaintiffs to judgment.
"If the first position of the defendants be correct, viz. that
no legal judgment has beei, given, the application of the plaintiffs must fail.
"By a positive law of the state of Louisiana, all judgments
rendered, if not set aside for legal cause within a given num"ber of days, must be signed by the judge before execution can
be taken out upon them; in other words, the judgments are
not complete, or rather are no judgments at all, until they
are so signed. A law of this state expressly requires the signature of the judge, before the judgment can be carried into

dition of a judgment pro forma, and the time allowed for
signing it, 't induce the judge to withhold his signature.
That such reasons did arjse in this case, may be presumed ;
for it is a legal presumption, that public functionaries perforin
their duty when required; and although it is not expected
that a judge will call for and sign judgments, without being
so required ; yet it is strange, that a party so much interested,
should not have made application to the judge in the course
of two years to sign this judgment; and it is also remarkable,
that the plaintiff's attorney of record, who procured the making
of the judgment entries, never has, to this day, made any
such application; but on the contrary, the record shows, that
they subsequently instituted new suits, in thl name of the
assignees of the original plaintiffs, against the same defendants,
to recover the amount now in controversy. Why did they
proceed in this manner, if they had a right to the original
judgment. The judge's signature" to a judgment being, by
our law, al essential part of it, inasmuch as it is a dead letter
without it ; it follows, that he who signs it, thereby makes it
his own judgment. Therefore, were I to give validity to
what is here called a judgment, by affixing to it my signature,
would it not be to pronounce on the rights of the parties whose
cause I have never heard ?"
These, and other reasons assigned in illustration of the
principles above stated, induced the district judge to refuse his
signature to the judgment.
The case was argued by Mr Selden and Mr Jones, for the
plaintiffs; and by Mr Coxe and Mr Porter, for the defendants.
The opinion of the court was given upon no other question
argued by counsel, but the right of the judge to refuse to sign
the judgment.
Upon this question, it was contended, on the part of the
plaintiffs, that the signing of the judgment was a ministerial,
and not a judicial act.

mere formality, not required at common law. It was not required by the Spanish law. That law required, that it should

law 3, 1 Morcau and Carleton's translation, p. 264--5
The statute, (commonly called the practice act, which by the
act of congress of 26th May 1824, adopting the practice of
the state courts, regulates the practice of the United States
courts.in Louisiana) which contains the provision requiring
judgments to be signed, is of the 10th April 1805 (5 Martin's Digest 164) ; and is not to be found in Morcau's Digest.
The code of practice has changed the course of proceeding in
the state courts; but that code is not observed in the district
court of the United States: it was enacted on the 2d October
1825, since the act of congress regulating the practice of the
United States courts in Louisiana. The inquiry, then, is to
be directed to the laws in force previous to the adoption of the
code of practice. The statute of 10th April 1805,.follows the
Spanish law, and requires all judgments to be pronounced in
open court, entered on the minutes, and three days thereafter,
signed-not by the judge who rendeted them-but by the presiding judge of the court; provided they should not be set
aside by motion for a new trial. This statute, in the same section, requires judgments to be docketed, and in the next (5
Martin's Dig. 166) provides that no execution shall issue on
any judgment not docketed in form aforesaid. Will any one
contend, that the docketing is of the essence of'the judgment'?
It is required in the same manner as the signing is; and it is
clear that they are both purely ministerial acts,-the rendition of
the judgment, and the hearing of the motion for a new trial
within the three days, being judicial acts, and after the three
days the judgment is then perfect in all its essential parts, and
is to be completed in its formalities by being signed and docketed.
The present application is not an attempt to controt the
discretion of the judge. Under this Louisiana act one of
three things must be done :-the judge must grant a new trial
-arrest the judgment-or sign it. If he cannot arrest the
judgment, and will not grant a new trial, the only other alternative is to sign the judgment. If no application be made for
a new trial within three days, it in then the duty of the judge

SUPREME COURT
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of Now York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

to perfect the judgment, and the right of the party to have it
perfected. No exercise of judici-l functions is afterwards required, and it only remains for the judge to do the mere ministerial act of signing the judgment, which the parties, by omitting to apply for a new trial, have tacitly admitted must be
carried intoeffect.
No application was ever made for a new trial. Indeed, on

judgment. The case comes then before the court as one in
which no application was iade for a new trial to the only
judge who, according to the argument, could ggant it, and in
which the defendants did not desire to have a new trial.
Though the discretion of a judge will not be controlled, and
though a mandamus will not go to compel huim to decide in a
particular way, it will go to make him decide so that a writ of
error may be had.
A mandamus lies to compel the signing-of a bill of exceptions by the circuit court. Ciane and another, 5 Peters's Rep.
190.- In I Stra. 42, 93, 211, is the case of a mandamus to
a judge of probates to-grant to the next of kin ; though it is a

the-next of kin in preference to any other. So it lies to conpel a court to proceed to judgment. As in the People v. The

a writ of error. The words of a statute of West. 2, (13 Ed. 1)

not more imperative than are those of this' Louisiana act :""if
the party write the exception, ant! pray that the justices may

seals, and if one will not another shall." By the act of con ress

of May 26th, 1790, ch. 38, the "presiding magistrate" is required to certify the proceedings of the court so as to mike
them evidence in other courts. Could he refuse? And w ould
there be any greater interference with judicial discretion in
granting the application at bar than there is in the instances
here enumerated ?
It is not required by the Louisiana statute, that the judge
who rendered the judgment should-sign it. Had such been
the provision of the statute, all impossibility might have been
required. The judge who tried the cause might die within the
three' days, or he might resign, or be displaced before the signing of the judgment. Could his successor, on general principles, in any of these cases, refuse to sign it, after the lapse of
the three days ? The judgment is the act of the court, and
not merely of the individual judge. A court never dies. It
will see that its judgments are completed and carried into effect. It is the duty of the successor to perfect and carry into
effect all acts begun by his predecessor, and pending, in the.
court at the time of his appointment.
And let it not be lost sight of, that no law or decision of Louisiana can be produced requiring the judge rendering the judgment to sign it. Judge Harper, in his reasons, cites a section
of an act of 1817. But that section makes no change in the
act of 1805, as to the formality of signing the judgment, and
the judge by whom that act may be done.

The requisition of

the statute is not, that " the judge rendering a judgment must
remain long enough at the place of holding the court in order
to sign it ;" but that he shall remain three days after pronouncing judgment to hear motions for new trials :-the words are,
"that seven judicial days from that on which a final judgment
shall have been rendered, shall be allowed to make a motion
'for a new trial in the district court for the first district, and
the parish court of New Orleans, and that until then the judgment shall not be signed by the judge ; and that in all the
other district courts of the state, the inotion shall be made and
the judgment signed within three judicial days only, and for
that purpose it shall be the duty of the judges of the district
courts to sit three days longer after the last cause which they
shall have determined in each term." The judge who tried
the cause must remain the three days to hear motions for new

[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]
trials, because no judge can hear such a motion who has not
heard the cause, and because this is a judicial act and not a
ministerial act.
It is not necessary that the judgment should be signed on the
third day : it may be signed afterwards. This is decided in
Thompson v. Chretien et al. 12 Martin's Rep. 250 (1822),
There were other questions in that cause; but one was, whether the judge must not.sign the judgment on the third day,
and whether it is not void if signed afterwards. The court
say: " the object of the legislature in the section quoted from
2 Mart. Dig. 164, was to afford the party a delay of three days
to state his objections, and for this purpose prohibited the judge
to give effect to it by his signature till the expiration of that
delay. It is not intended to require the judge's signature on
that day." In that case, the judgment was not signed till several days after its rendition.
There was no occasion for urgency in signing this particular
judgment. It was confessed in May 1826, with a stay of execution till the 18th January 1829-very nearly three years.
No execution could be issued till then. Why sign the judgment before 7 Signing virtually authorises an execution to
issue. Of what use would signing be until the stay expired and
an execution was wanted? Inadvertently omitted as it was,
still the application for this formal act to be done, would seem
to be in full time, when execution was necessary, and the parties had become entitled to it.
Judge Harper's refusal to perfect the judgment, renders the
condition of plaintiffs and defendants unequal. Had he signed
it, the defendants could have brought a writ of error, and obtained a review of the question, whether he, as the successor of
judge Robertson, was bound to sign the judgment, and also of
the alleged irregularities. But the plaintiffs, by such refusal,
are deprived not only of all remedy and benefit under their
judgment in the court below, but also of the right of suing out
a writ of error to this court. The district judge ought either to
have signed the judgment, and put the defendants to a writ of
error, or arrested the judgment, 'and afforded the plaintiffs the
opportunity of suing out such writ--a right of which they ought
not to be deprived.
This is not a question of practice. There are no precedents

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

on the subject. The death of the judge has occasioned the
difficulty; and judges so seldom die, that there is no jurisprudence yet formed in relation to their demise. It is a question of
law depending upon the statute and the ancient jurisprudence
of Louisiana, and is simply this: Is or not the signing of a
judgment, after the delays for granting a new trial have expired, a judicial or simply a ministerial act ? The signing by the
judge who rendered the judgment is not required by any law of
Louisiana. It is not of the essence of the judgment, but is a
mere formality, which does not affect its substantial properties
and force.
Upon the whole, it is submitted that judge Harper ought to
have signed this judgment. The act is merely ministerial. On
general principles, as the successor of judge Robertson, he
was bound to complete the judgment. So under the Louisiana act of 1805. There is not only nothing in that act which
requires the judge who presided at the confession of the judgment to sign it, but by its express provisions, the signing is required to be by the presiding judge of the court,-presiding at
the time the application t6 sign should be made ;-words used,
no doubt, t6 avoid the diffictilty which would arise from the
death, resignation or removal of the judge who presided at the
trial.
Mr Coxe and Mr Porter contended, that this was not a case
in which a judge was called upon to do an act merely ministerial. The district judge has-given the facts and reasons which
operated on him, judicially, to refuse his signature to the judgment. They are briefly these. The first fact on which he
relies is the laches of the plaintiffs. He states that, from the
records of the court, it appears that judge Robertson held three
terms of the court after the entry of the judgment, and did not
die until more than two years after. He next adverts to the
state law, which requires that to render a judgment valid,
it must be signed within a certain number of days, unless set
aside. He states that this has been the invariable practice of
the court of the United States, in Louisiana; and he draws the
inevitable consequences from the neglect of the plaintiffs in
obtaining this signature, that they were conscious of the existence of good causes that vould have induced judge Robertson

SUPREME COURT.
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

to refuse signing it. He states positively, that the same attorneys who instituted the suit, have subsequently, in the same
court, instituted new suits, in the name of assignees of the
original plaintiffs, against the same defendants, for the same
cause of action. This alone would be sufficient to prevent his
acting.
The signing of the judgment has been improperly called
a ministerial act, a mere formality-it is: neither.
Whatever a judge may do, or may refuse to do, according to
the circumstances of the case, is a judicial act. Here, after a
judge has pronounced his opinion in open court, and had it entered on the minutes, he may refuse to perfect it, if he sees that
injustice has been done, and order a new trial ; or he may arrest
the judgment for such radical errors in the proceedings as show
that no valid judgment can be founded on them. Ordering
the judge to sign this judgment would be directing him what
judgment to render; for it would be saying, You shall not grant
a new trial; you shall not a'rest the judgment; but you must
confirm it. Now this is contrary to an express decision of
this court, in the case of the United States v. Lawrence, 3
Dallas 42.
In his reasons the judge remarks with some Porce on the
injustice of forcing him by a process of this kind to decide a
case on evidence which had not been offered to him, but to
another ; which (if the argument to shov that this is a judgment, not a ministerial act, be correct) would be conclusive
against the motion. Ought he not to be permitted to look into
the proceedings? to see whether the defendant has appeared?
whether he has been cited ? whether the court has jurisdiction
of the case; whether the party who appears by attorney is not
stated to be an infant ? to examine, in short, whether the proceedings Pre in legal form? Should any hardship on the part
of the plaintiffs be urged, the answer is ready. Whatever of
inconvenience exists, is of the plaintiffs' own creation; the
delay has been produced by their own negligence; or worse, by
their desire to overreach-and they are not without remedy.
A new action, avoiding all the irregularities of this, would have
produced a decision on the merits, in less time, and at less
expense, than by this application ; at the same time that the
mortgage, if it be a legal one, binds all the property as effectu-

[Life and Firo Insurance Company of Now York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

ally as a judgment, and carries back the-lien to an earlier date.
Authorities to show that the signature of the judgment is necessary, need scarcely be produced. For the satisfaction of the
court, however, the following statutory provisions are referred
to. I Acts of the Territory of Orleans, p. 234, see. 13 ; 2
Martin's Digest, 164, No. 11 ; Acts of 1817, p. 32, see. 11.
All these acts may he found in'Leslet's Digest, Code of Practice, 546.
The act required of the judge of the district by the mandamus, was entirely judicial. He had refused to sign the judgment, and had given his reasons for the same, and he is now
to reverse this judgrnet.
A mandamus is not the proper remedy. It is never issued
when the act required to be done under it is other than minislerial it is properly to be directed to the judge, and not to the
court ; and in this case it is judicially known that the court is
composed of but one judge.
There was no judgment rendered by judge Robcrtson. The
case was not, therefore, judicially disposed of before his death ;
and the present judge, before he can sign the judgment, must
examine the record. This was done by him, and he judicially
decided that he could not sign the record. This is conclusive ;
if the judge is any thing more than a mere clerk to perfect the
record.
What acts of a judge are ministerial ? They are all judicial.
Does this court act ministeriallyin anycase, or on any occasion ?
The law of Louisiana requires the judge to remain three
days.at the place where the court is held, before lie signs the
judgment, which affords an opportunity to examine if there are
any reasons for a new trial. But in this case no opportunity
for a new trial can be allowed, if the duty of the judge is absolute, if he must sign the judgment. The law does not require
that a new trial shall be asked in three days ; if it is not asked
in that time, and judgment has not been signed, the case is open
for the application.
Upon the authority of the civil code of Louisiana, the judge
may order a new trial up to the time of signing the judgment.
And in this case a new trial could have been given by the judge
of the district court, if he had been required to grant'it. No
application was before him for any purpose but to obtain his

SUPREME COURT.
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

signature to the judgment. The proceedings in this case are
evidently defective, as it is admitted the minors, heirs of Nicholas Wilson, had not notice of the application for signing the
judgment.
Mr Jones, in reply, contended, that after the judgment had
been entered on the minutes, as the oral judgment of judge
Robertson, the proceedings to complete the record were mere
matters of form. In this case, particularly, the form of signing
was all that was necessary, for the party had made no application for a new trial. The state of the record w'as such, as
that the judge could sign the judgment ; as is done when a
warrant of attorney is given, which fully authorises the entry
of judgment. Judges frequently act ministerially. The certificate to a record, and the signature of a judge in allowing a
writ of error, are ministerial acts.
There is no force in the objection, that as the present judge
did not sit on the trial of this cause, he cannot grant a new
trial. It often occurs that new trials are moved for and granted
by other judges than those before whom the cases have been
tried. New trials' are moved for "in bank," before all the
court : trials take place at nisi prius before a singl6 judge.
Mr Justice M'LEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
In the argument, on the motion to make the rule for a
mandamus absolute, various objections were taken against the
jurisdiction of the district court.
It is insisted that the plaintiffs, in their corporate capacity,
can ;oeither make a contract in Louisiana, nor enfoice it in that
state by suit; and if they could, the proceedings in the case
were erroneous, and might be reversed on a writ of error.
In the consideration of the question now before the court,
they do not consider themselves authorised to examine into the
regularity of the proceedings in the case before the district
court, as they would do on a writ of error. The point of inquiry is, whether the district judge, under the circumstances
of the case, was bound to sign the judgment.
The writ of mandamus is subject to The legal and equitable
discretion of the court, and it ought not to be issued in cases

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

of doubtful right. But it is the only adequate mode of relief,
where an inferior tribunal refuses to act upon a subject brought
properly before it.
In this case the district judge seems to think, that as the
judgment was not rendered -by him, he has no power to grant
a new trial, as he is not acquainted with the facts and circumstances which should influence his discretion in making such
an order ; and that, consequently, he is not bound to sanction
the judgment, by his signature.
By the law of Louisiana, and the rule adopted by the district
court, the judgment, without the signature of the judge, cannot be enforced. It is not a final judgment, on which a writ
of error may issue, for its revei'sal. Without the action of the
judge the plaintiffs can take no step, unless it be the one they
have taken, in this case. They can neither issue execution on
the judgment, nor reverse the proceedings by writ of error.
And if the reasons assigned by the judge shall be deemed a
sufficient answer to the rule, the plaintiffs are without remedy
on their judgment.
But the district judge is mistaken in supposing that no one
but the judge who renders the judgment, can grant a new
trial. Ile, as the successor of his predecessor, can exercise the
same powers, and has a right to act on every case that remains
undecided upon the docket, as fully as his predecessor could
have done. The court remains the same, and the charge of'
the incumbents cannot and ought not, in any respect, to injure
the rights of litigant parties.
The case referred to in 6 Wheat. 542, 5 Cond. Rep. 170,
asserts nothing in opposition to this principle. A motion for a
new trial is always addressed to the discretion of the court,
and this court will not control the exercise of that discretion,
by a circuit court, either by a writ of mandamus, or on a certi.
ficate of division between the judges.
After the rendition of the judgment, three days are allowed
by the law of, Louisiana, within which to move for a nvw
trial ; and if no new trial shall have been granted, the judge
is required to sign the judgment at the expiration of this time.
It. may be in the power of a judge, under this law, in the state
court, where the judgment has not been signed, to giant a new
trial after the lapse of a much longer time than is specified in

SUPREME COURT.
(Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York v. Wilson's Heirs.]

the act ; but this question is not raised in the present case, as
the district judge has, in not granling a new trial, decided
against it. It is immaterial what re sons may have influenced
this decision, as it was a matter which rested in his discretion.
But the important inqniry is, whether, after refusing to grant
a new trial, either on a full consideration of the merits, or bocause he had not a sufficient knowledge'of them, he was not
bound to sign the judgmept.
On a mandamus a superior court will never direct in what

manner the discretion of an inferior tribunal shall be exercised ;
but they will, in a proper case, require the inferior court to decide.

But, so far as it, regnads the case under consideration,

the signature of the judge was not a matter of discretion. It
followed as a necessary consequence of the judgment, unless
the judgment had been set aside by a new trial. The act of
signing the judgment is a ministerial and not a judicial act.
On the allowance of a writ of error, a judge is required to sign
a citation to the defendant in error ; he is required in other
cases, to do acts which are not strictly judicial.
The judgment may be erroneous, but this is no reason why
the judge should not sign it. Until his signature be afffixedto
the judgment, no proceedings can be had for its reversal. He
has, therefore, no right to withhold his signature, where, in the
exercise of his discretion, he does trot set aside the judgment.
As well might a judge refuse to enter up the judgment upon a
verdict, which he would not or could not setaside, as to withhold
his signature in the present case. The cause should be placed
in such a posture as to enable the plaintiffs to proceed to another trial, or to take out execution on their judgment. As the
former has not been done, the latter may be claimed by the
plaintiffs as a matter of right.
This court, therefore, direct, that the writ of mandamus be
issued, directing the district judge to sigh the judgment, agreeably to the prayer of the plaintiffs.

On motion of plaintiff for a mandamus to the district court
of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana.
On consideration of the rule granted in this cause by this
