8UPREME COURT.

UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFPS IN ERROR V. TENCH RINGGOLD.
On the opening of the record for the argument of this case, it was found that
the sum in controversy was less than the amount which, according to the
act of congress, authorises a writ of error, except on a special allocatur,
from tise eircuit court of the District of Columbia, to this court. The provisions of the law permit writs of error to be sued out without such allocatur,
when the sum in controversy amounts to one thousand dollars, and upwards.
On the applicatibn of- the counsel, stating, the questions in the case were of
great public importance, and were required to be determined, in order to
the final settlement of other accounts in which the same principles were
involved ; the court gave the special aliocatur.
The marshal of the District of Columbia, upon the settlement of his accounts
at the treasury, claimed an allowance and credit by the United States, for
the sum of one thousand one hundred and eleven dollars and two cents,
being the amount of his poundage fees on a capias ad satisfaciendum,
against John Gates, at the suit of the United States, md upon which Gates
was arrested by the defendant, as marshal, and committed to jail, and afterwards discharged by order of the United States.
Admitting the defendant in an execution to be liable for poundage, if the
plaintiff releases or discharges him, and thereby deprives the marshal of all
recourse to the defendant, there can be no doubt that the Dlaintiff would
thereby make himself responsible for the poundage.
By the statutes of Maryland, relative to poundage fees, in force in the county
of Washington, in the District of Columbia, the marshal is entitled to
poundage on an execution -executed, and they fix the rate. of allowance
those statutes do not designate which of the parties shall pay the poundage.
It is undoubtedly a general rule, that no court can give a direct jtldgment
against the United States for costs, in a suit to which they are, a party,
either on behalf of any suitor, or any officer of the government' But it by
no means follows, from this, that they are not liable for their own costs.
No direct suit can be maintained against the United States. But when an
action is brought by the United -States, to recover money in the hands of a
party, who has a legal claim against them for costs; it would be a very rigid
principle, to deny to him the right of setting up such claim in a court of
justice, and turn him,round to an application to congress. If the right of the
party is flxed by the existing law, there can be ie necessity for an application to congress, except for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity
can exist, when this right can pronerly be set up by way of defence, to a
suit by the United States.
rhe discharge, in this case, is absolute and unconditional; and the marshal
had no authority to hold the defendant in custody afterwards. Admitting
Gates to have been liable for these poundage fees, the marshal's power or
right to compel payment from him, was taken away by authority of the
United States, the plaintiff in the suit. And the right of the marshal to
claim his poundage fees from them, is thereby clearly established.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[United States v. Rinq'old 1

ERROR to the circuit court of the United States for the
county of Washington, in the District of Columbia.
This was an action of assumpsit, instituted by the United
States in the circuit court, to recover the surnof three hundred
and forty-five dollars, money of the plaintiffs ; alleged to have
been received by the defendant as marshal of the District of
Columbia. The defendant pleaded non assumpsit, and issue
was joined thereon. The counsel for the plaintiffs and defendant, submitted the following statement, subject to the opinion
of the court on the law and facts.
This is an action of assumpsit, biought to recover the sum of
three hundred'and forty-five dollars, money of the plaintiffs,
which came to the hands of the defendant as marshal of the
District of Columbia. Upon the settlement of the defendant's
accounts as marshal, with the treasury, he claimed an allowance and credit for the sum of eleven hundred and eleven dollars and two cents (see account marked A), being the amount
of his poundage fees on a capias ad satisfaciendum against
John Gates, at the suit of the United States, and upon which
Gates was arrested by the defendant as marshal, and committed
to jail, and afterwards discharged by order of the president of
the United States. (See statement marked B.)

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Uiited States v. Ringgold.]

The circuit court gave judgment in favGur of the defendant
and the United States prosecuted this writ of error.
The case was arguedby Mr Butler, attorney-general, for
the United States ; and by Coxe, for.the defendant.
On the opening of, the record it was found that the sum in
controversy was less than the amount which, according to the
act of congress, authorises a writ of ieror, except on a special
allocatur, from the circuit court of the District of Cohunbia, to
this court. The provisions of the law permit writs of error to
be sued out without such allocatur, when the sum in controversy amounts to one thousand dollars, and upwards.
The Attorney-General and Mr Coxe requested the court to
give a special allocatur nune pro tune, as the questions in the
case were of grea-t public importance, and were required to be
determined, in order to the final settlement of other accounts
in which the same principles were involved.
The court, on these representations, gave the special allocatur.
The Attorney-General, for the plaintiffs in error, contendeu,
that the judgment of the circuit court was erroneous, for the
following reasons.
1. By the laws of Maryland (to which the acts. of congress
refer), the defendant, and not the plaintiff, is liable to the sheriff
or marshal for his poundage on the-service of a ca. sa.
2. Whatever may be the rule in respect to individuals, the
United States, under the general. terms employed in the acts
of congress and of the state of Maryland, are not liable to the
officer.
The marshal of the District of Columbia is not. entitled.to
poundage fees, under the acts of congress of 1801 and 1803.
By those acts the same fees. are given to that officer, as are
allowed for similar services by the laws of Maryland. No
poundage fees are allowed in a case of this kind, by the Maryland law.
It has been gravely questioned, whether the law of En~gland,
which gave poundage fees, was ever in force in Maryland; the
best opinions are, that it never was in force in that state, and
therefore no right to such fees can exist. No case in which
such fees have been allowed, is to be found. The sheriff (and
VOL. VI.--U

SUPREME COURT.
(United States v. Ringgold.]

by this same rule, the marshal of this district) is not entitled,
in Maryland, to any fees as powudage, unless by the special
provisions of soine statute.
The statutes of Maryland, in reference to the fees of the
sheriff, are those of 1753, 1759.
Upon those statutes there have-bean contradictory decisions
in the courts of Maryland. In 1 S05 it was decided that the
defendant, and not the plaintiff, was, liable for the poundage
fees of the sheriti'; and under the authority of this decision, the
circuit court of this district decided differently from their decision in this case.
Afterwards, in the case of Mason v. Muncaster, decided in
1829, the circuit court of the district of Coluinbia adjudged
that the plaintiff was liable to the marshal for such fees.(a)

the opinion of Mr Justice

This case comes before the court on a motion to quash two writs of fieri
facias, levied on certain lands of the defendant, the sale of which was postponed by agreement of the parties, in order that the opinion of the court might
be had, whether the marshal is entitled to poundage fees on levying an execution upon lands which are not sold.
By the act of congress of 27th February 1801, see. 9, the marshal was entitled to receive the same fees, perquisites and emoluments, as the marshal of
the United States for the district of Maryland. By the act of 3d March 1807,
the marshal, for services not enumerated in that or some other act of congress,
is entitled to such fees as were, on the first Monday of December 1800, allowed
by the laws of Maryland to a sheriff for like services. The poundage fee is
not expressly given or regulated by any act of congress.
By the stat. West. 1, c. 26, no officer shall take any reward to do his office,
but of the king. And by the 29 El., c. 4, no sheriff shall " receive or take of
any person for serving an execution on the body,'lands, goods or chattels of
any person, more or other consideration or recompense, than twelve pence
of and for every twenty shillings that he shall levy or extend, and deliver in
execution, or take the bomdy in execution for, by virtue and force of any such
extent or execution." This act does not contain the word poundage. The
14th see. 3 Geo, 1, c. 15, uses the word C, poundage," allowed by that act:
and (see. 16) " for ascertaining the fees for executing of writs of elegit, so far
as the same relate to the extending of real estates, and for executing writs of
hb. fac. poss. aut seisinam," it is enacted, " that it shall not be lawful for any
sheriff, by reason or colour of office, or by reason or colour of executing any
writ o- writs of hab. fac. poss. aut seisinam, to ask, demand, or receive any
other or greater consideration, fee, gratuity or reward, than twelve pence of
every twenty shillings of the yearly value."
By section 17, reciting
that "it 9ften happens that small sums -only remain due upon judgments, but

[United States v. Ringgold.]

If there is no decision of the courts of Maryland on the question, this court will examine the law of that state, and will
upon executing writs of ca. sa., the sheriff takes for his fees poundage for the
whole money for which such judgments are entered," it is enacted that
"poundage shall in no case be demanded or taken upon executing any writ
of ca. sa. or upon charging any person in execution by virtue of such writ,
for any greater sum than the real debt bona fide due and claimed by the plaintiff," under the penalty of treble damages to the party aggrieved ; but the
statute does not say whether the party aggrieved by the plaintiff or defendant,
nor which of them is bound to pay the poundage. The 8 G. 1, c. 25, sec. 3,
recites that " by the 23 H. 8, there was due to his majesty a fee of one halfpenny in the pound upon every recognizance to be paid on sealing the first
process, which is very heavy on every prosecutor on every such recognizance;
and that the fees taken by sheriffs in getting an extent or execution on such
recognizances are very expensive, and enacts that the prosecutor shall mark
the sum to be extended or levied, which sum the officer shall insert in the
writ to be only extended or levied, and no more, and on which the poundage
of one halfpenny shall be paid. And by the fifth section, the sheriff upon
such recognizances shall take only the same fees as are appointed by the
3 G. 1. By the act of Maryland of 12th October 1753, c. 22, it is enacted,
" that no officer, by reason or colour of his office, shall have, receive, or take
of any person any other or greater fees than by this act are allowed : to the
sheriff serving an attachment or execution, seven pounds of tobacco; and-if
any execution be for above one hundred and under five hundred pounds of
tobacco, then thirty-seven pounds of tobacco ; ifit exceed five hundred pounds,
then fifty-seven pounds, and so on ; and if any execution be for money, the
sheriff to have at the rate of seven per centum for the first five pounds, and
three per centum for the residue in the same specie the execution is issued
for. The act of 1779, c. 25, gives " to the sheriff the same fees on a fieri
facias or replevin, as upon attachments :" " for all goods and chattels which
he shall'attach and take into his possession or wherewith he shall be chargeable, the same fees as on execution." And by section 5, "1on the service
of any execution for money or tobacco, the sheriff for the service of the same
shall charge and receive on the same at the rate of ten per centum for the
first five pounds, &c., and five per centum for the residue ; and no sheriff
shall be chargeable in any action of escape, for more than the sum of money
really due or indorsed to be received on the execution in discharge thereof.
By the act of 1790, c. 59, see. 2, " instead of the poundage fees to the sheriff
by the first-mentioned act (1779, c. 25), he be allowed only at the rate of seven
and a half per centam for the first ten pounds, and at the rate of three per
centum for the residue; and where execution or attachment shall be made
on lands held for yers or a greater estate, only half of the poundage fees ;
but if the estate be not chargeable by appraisement and delivered to the
plaintiff, or by sale of the sheriff, one quarter part of the poundage fees only
shall be chargeable."

a ca. sa. Lord Coke said, "if he has not an action of debt, he has no remedy;
and therefore, forasmuch as the.words are, that he shall have, receive and
take, this makes it a duty in him, and so the action lies: quod fuit concessum
per curiam." Welden v. Vescy, Popham 173, debt by the sheriff against the
creditor, for seven pounds and six pence, for poundage on one hundred and
eighty.one pounds, for which the debtor was taken on a ca. sa. It was decided, that the sheriff should have five per centum on the first one hundred
pounds, and two and a-half on the residue: and Whitlock, J. was of opinion,
that the sheriff may refuse to do execution, until the levying money be paid
to him: but that point was not decided. The sheriff recovered his poundage
against tme plaintiff in the following cases. Brockwell v. Lock, Peacock v.
Harris, 1 Salk. 331; Jayson v. Rash, 1 Salk. 209; Lyster v. Bromley, Cro.
Car. 286; Earl v. Plummer, 12 Mod. 124; Tyson v. Parke, 1 Salk. 333;
Pope v. Hayman, Holt's Rep. 317; Suliard v. Stampe, Moore 468; Gurney
and Some's case, Cro. Eliz. 335.. In all these cases, the action was against
the original plaintiff, in the execution; and there is no case in which the
marshal or sheriff brought his action for poundage, against the original debtor,
in the execution. In Earl v. Plummer, the action was brought by the sheriff,
for his poundage on executing an erroneous writ, and the court said, "that
if the party himself will take out such an erroneous writ, he shall not, under
pretence thereof, cheat the sheriff of his fees." Woodgate v. Knatchbull, 2
T. R. 148, was an action on the case, under the 29th El. c. 4,by the defendant, in a fi. fa. against the sheriff for damages, for taking more than his poundage, for levying the fi. fa. verdict for the plaintiff, for fifty-four pounds and
fourteen shillings. Rule to show cause why tihe verdict should not be set
aside. The council, in arguing in support of the rule, said: "the mischief
intended to be remedied by the act of Eliz., was the negligence of sheriffs in
executing process; persons who had recovered judgments, being obliged to
pay money to sheriffs, to induce them to do their duty properly, in levying
the sums recovered. This was to be remedied, by allowing the sheriff so
much in the pound, for the sum levied as a stimulus to.him ; but to prevent
him from charging the plaintiff in the original suits, with more than was
allowed, the act gave the two remedies therein specified. They, therefore,
were the only persons intended to be benefited by such pecuniary compensations, and not the defendants." Buller J. says, ",if the plaintiff choose to
have .an auction, he must defray the expenses out of his own debt, to be
levied; ibr there is no colour to charge the defendant with it. The sheriff can
only levy on the defendant, that sum which is given by the judgment of the
court." The judgment was for two hundred pounds; but the fi. fa. was indorsed to levy one hundred and sixteen pounds, besides the costs of levying
and sheriff's fees. He said further, "then the only remaining question is,
whether, in this case, it appears that the plaintiff is.the party grieved ? The'
first execution was what struck me as a ground for this doubt. The judgment
there, was for two hundred pounds. The sheriff was at liberty, by the judgment of this court, to raise two hundred pounds, but no more ; and the expenses of levying must have been paid out of the debt. For, in actions on
simple contract, and judgment for a debt certain, the expenses of levying

[United States v. Ringgold.]

2. But whatever may be the law as to individuals, the government is not liable, unless specially declared to be so by
statute.
must be paid by the plaintiff, and not by the defendant; so that, if the sheriff
overcharge, the plaintiff is the sufferer. But if the judgment be for a penalty,
the plaintiff has a right to receive the whole of his debt, independent of the
expenses of the execution, and in those cases, the defendant is the party injured by the sheriff's taking more than he ought. Grose J. said, " at common
law, no fee whatever was allowed to the sheriff; then, if he be entitled to
receive any, it must be by act of parliament. Now, by looking into the act,
it appears clearly to have been the intention of the legislature that the sheriff'
should be paid in proportion to the sum levied, out of the sum levied, and that
the sheriff should only levy what was really due." In Bonafous v. Walker, 2
T. R. 126, which was debt against the sheriff for an escape, the court decided
that the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the sheriff all that he had a right
to receive from the debtor, who had escaped, including the poundage; and
Buller, J. said, " for poundage is part of the debt, and the prisoner could not
have been discharged out of execution without paying the poundage, and
therefore, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all, he was entitled to recover the poundage as well as the debt." Lake v. Turner, 4 Bur. 1981, was
debt by the sheriff for poundage on a ca. sa. in favour of defendant against
Gibbs, who was arrested by plaintiff. The only ground of defence was, that
the ca. sa. was prosecuted at the instance and for the benefit of the king, who,
not being named in the stat. 29 El. c. 4, is not bound by it, and not liable for
poundage. But this defence was upon demurrer adjudged bad, and the plaintiff had judgment. In Alchin v. Wells, 5 T. R. 470, it is held that if the
sheriff levy under'a fi. fa. he is entitled to poundage, though the parties compromise before he sells any of the defendant's goods ; and if the sheriff, notwithstanding the compromise, satisfy himself for the poundage on the debt,
the court will not rule him to return the writ. Fisher v. Beatty, 3 Har. and
M'H. 148, was an action of replevin for goods taken by the defendant, as
sheriff, to satisfy his poundage and other fees due on a writ of fi. fa. and a
venditioni exponas, which last writ was countermanded before execution, and
so returned by the sheriff beforre he took the goods in execution for his poundage. The general court decided that the sheriff could not execute in that
case for his poundage, and that the defendant in an execution is not liable to
the sheriff for his poundage. In Madox v. Cranch, 4 Har. and M'H. 343,
the general court decided that the plaintiff in an attachment was liable for
poundage. In Stewart v. Dorsey, 3 Har. and M'H. 401, the defendant had been
taken in execution by the plaintiff, (the sheriff) at the suit of the state, who
agreed to release the defendant on his paying all legal costs, and the defendant promised to pay the poundage to the sheriff, who thereupon discharged
him. The court gave judgment for the sheriff in an action against the defendant upon that promise. A manuscript report of the case of Howard v.
Justices of the levy court of Ann Arundel, in 1805, was cited in this court
in April 1821, in the case of Ringgold v. Nicholls; in which the general
court, after full argument, decided that the defendant, and not the plaintiff,
is 'liable to the sheriff for poundage, And upon that decision, this court
(Morsell, J. absent, and the other judges doubting) decided the case of Ring-

SUPREME COURT.
(United States v. Ringgold.]

The acts of congress do not profess to give the marshal fees
of this description. They are entirely silent in reference to
them; and, therefore, no right to them exists. They cannot
then be set off in an account with the United States.
The government is not included in any general statute, but
there must be an express provision in a statute, to make it
operate upon the United States. The Antelope, 12 Wheaton

The defendant should have applied to the legislature for relief. If the services were such as to entitle-them to compensation, and this is not denied, they would have been allowed
to him by congress. This was done on the application of
the marshal of the district of Maine, in a similar case.
Mr Coxe, for the defendant, contended, that the law of
Maryland was, that poundage should be paid to the sheriff,in

case of the discharge of the defendant; and that the adjudged
cases upon this point, were conclusive. He referred to the
opinion of the circuit court, in the case of Mason v. Muncaster,
gold and Nicholls. Letters were read by the counsel in that cause, from Mr
Harris and Mr Taney, stating that the question was still open in Maryland,
and from Mr Williams, that the court bf appeals had decided that the plaintiff
is not liable to the sheriff when the defendant is discharged under the i:'qolvent law.
By the consideration of all these cases, we are led to the conclusion:
1. That the plaintiff in a ca. sa. is liable to the marshal for his poundage,
as soon as he has taken the body of the defendant in execution upon that writ.
2. That the plaintiff in a'fi. fa. is also liable to the marshal for his whole
poundage on the debt, if he levy goods to the value of the debt, whether they
be sold or not. If sold, and they produce less than the debt, lie can claim
poundage only on the amount made.
3. The original defendant is not liable in any form of action to the marshal,
nor to the original plaintiff, for the poundage, nor is he or his property liable
for poundage, unless the judgment be for a stim larger than the debt due from
the defendant, to be released on payment of the amount really due, with costs,
for the marshal cannot, on a fi. fa. make more than the amount of the judgment, nor can he detain the debtor upon a ca. sa. for more than that amount.
4. In the present case, the marshal, not having returned the fi. fa. may
proceed to execute it for his poundage; and in this way only, hits the marshal a legal claim on the defendant in this cause, for the poundage ; unless
he shall have promised to pay it upon a good consideration.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[United States v. Ringgqld.]

for the authorities on the point, both in Maryland and in
England.
On the second point presented by the attorney-general, he
argued, that the construction of the acts of congress contended
for in behalf of the defendant, was of equal importance to all
the officers of the courts of the United States. No costs could
be allowed to the clerks, if none were to be allowed to the
marshal.
The exception in favour of the United States, as to costs, is,
that they are not liable to pay the defendant's costs. This is
a hardship ; but it is admitted to be the law. The claim in
this case is not affected byT that rule.
By the provisions of the acts of congress, the costs of the
marshal are required to be taxed by the circuit court, before
they are submitted to the treasury. The court is, by the law,
the judge of the legality of the allowances; and not the officers
of the treasury, as has been asserted in the present case. It
is denied, that such a right exists in the officers of the treasury;
and the court has now to determine the question.
During forty years, the marshals of the United States have
been allowed fees for services rendered to the United States;
and it is now attempted to distinguish the process for which
poundage is claimed, from those which have hitherto been
always allowed on the certificate of the court.
It is admitted, that the marshal must have a compensation
for his services on the execution. The responsibilities are
great, and they entitle him to fee.
From whom was he to
obtain them ? Not from the defendant; he was discharged by
the president, by an order for his discharge directed to the
marshal.
Could the marshal have detained the defendant for his fees
after this order? If, after this order, that right ceased, the
United States stands in the same relation to the officer, as does
any plaintiff.
An application was made to congress, by the marshal of
Maine, for poundage fees, in a case similar to this now before
the court, aud the same were allowed by law, the law of
Maine giving those fees to the sheriff, This shows the views
of the legislature upon the matter.

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Ringgold..

Mr Justice TffoMsoN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The United States brought a suit against the defendant, in
the circuit court for the county of Washington, in the district
of Columbia ; and upon the trial of the cause, the following
statement of facts was, by the agreement of the parties, submitted to the court for its opinion of the law thereupon.
"This is an action of assumpsit, brought to recover the sum
of three hundred and forty-five dollars, money of the plaintiffs,
which came to the hands of the defendant, as marshal of the
district of Columbia. Upon the settlement of the defendant's
accounts, as marshal, with the treasury, he claimed an allow-ance and credit for the sum of one thousand one hundred
and
eleven dollars andtwo cents, being the amount of his poundagefees on a capias ad satisfaciendum, against John Gates, at
the suit of the United States, and upon which Gates was
arrested by the defendant, as marshal, and committed to jail,
and afterwards discharged by order of the United States. It.
,is agreed that this claim was presented to the accounting officers of the treasury, before the institution of this suit, and disallowed."
Upon this statement of facts the circuit court gave judgment
for the defendant.
The matter in dispute, in this case, being under the value of
one thousand dollars, a writ of eror has been specially allowed,
according to the provisions of the act of congress of -April 2,
1816, (Davis's Col. 305) and the cause comes here for revision.
Upon the argument here, it has been contended
by the
attorney-general, on the part of the United States :
1. That by the laws of the state of Maryland, to which the
acts of congress refer, the defendant, and not the plaintiff, is
liable to the sheriff, or marshal, for his poundage, on the service of a capias ad satisfacierdum.
2. That whatever may be the rule in respect to individuals,
the United States, under the general terms employed in the
acts of congress and of the state of Maryland, are not liable
to. the officer.
That the defendant is legally entitled to the fees claimed by
him as poundage, upon the executiol served upon Gates, cannot be denied.
By the act of congress of the 27th of February 1801, Davis's

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[United States v. Ringgold.]

Col. 125, scc. 9, it is declared that the marshal shall be entitled
to receive, for his services, the same fees, perquisites and emoluments, which are by law allowed to the marshal of the United
States for the district of Maryland.
And by the act of congress of the 3d of March 1807, Davis's
Col. 176, provision is made for certain specified services by the
marshal, not, however, including poundage fees, but containing
this general provision, "'that for such services as are not enumerated in this or some other act of congress, the marshal shall
receive, for services performed in the county of Washington,
the like fees and compensation as, by the laws of Maryland in
force on the first Monday in December 1800, were allowed
to a sheriff of a county of Maryland for the like services.
By the Maryland law of 1779, ch. 25, sec. 5, the sheriff, on
the service of any execution for money or tobacco, shall charge
and receive on the same at the rate of ten per centum for the
first five pounds, and at the rate of five per centum for the
residue; and no sheriff shall be chargeable for any action of
escape for more than the sum of money really due or indorsed
to be received on the execution in discharge thereof.
If any doubt could exist whether an execution against the
body was included, or intended to be included under the gene,
ral terms "any execution for money or tobacco;" that ,doubt is
removed by the provision in relation to escapes, which can
apply only to cases where the party was held under an execution against the body.
This provision as to poundage, is modified by a subsequent
act of 1790, c.h. 59, see. 2, which declares, that instead of the
poundage fees to the sheriff by the act of 1779, he be allowed
only at the rate of seven and a half per centum for the first ten
pounds, and at the rate of three per centum for the residue ;
and this is the rate at which the marshal has charged his
poundage in the present case.
Although the right of the marshal to poundage on a capias
ad satisfaciendum, is clearly established by these laws; yet they
are silent with respect to the party who is liable to him for the
payment thereof.
In the case of Fisher v. Beatty, 3 flar. and M'Hen. 148,
in the court of appeals of Maryland, the question was made,
whether on an execution the defendant is liable'to the sheriff
VOL. VIII.-V

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Ringgold.]

for his fees ; and the court decided that lie was not. The
grounds upon which that d.ecision rested are not stated ; and
in two other cases in the same couit, Stewart v. Dorsey, 3 Har.
and M'Hen. 401 ; and Madock v. Cranch, 4 Har. and M'Hen.
343, the same question arose, but accompanied with circumstances that did not call for a direct decision upon the point,
though, in the latter case, the court say the fees must be paid
by the person who issues the attachment. From these cases
it would seem reasonable to conclude, that, in the courts in
Maryland, it is held that the plaintiffin the execution, and not
the defendant, is liable to the sheriff for his poundage.
If there is no statute making the defendant responsible for
such poundage, it follows, as matter of course, that it must be
paid by the plaintiff; and if the defendant is liable, and cannot
pay, the plaintiff will be responsible. By the common law,
costs are not recoverable against the opposite party; and he
who requires the service to be performed, must pay all legal

charges for such service. It may not, however, be amiss, to
observe, that, although, from the cases referred to in the court
ofappeals in Maryland, it is fairly, to be inferred, that, according
to the construction there given to the statutesof thatstateon this
subject, the plaintiff, and not the defendant, is liable to the
sheriff for the poundage fees on a capias ad satisfaciendum
yet a ontrary conclusion may well be drawn, if not necessarily
implied, in the provision contained in the fourth section of the
act of 1779, ch. 25, which declares, that where any writ of
capias ad satisfaciendum shall issue, poundage shall in no case
be demanded or taken, upon execution of such writ, or upon
charging any person in execution by yirtue of such writ, for
any greater sum than the real debt bona fide due and claimed
by the plaintiff, amounts to ; which sum the clerk; or the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, shall, and. are hereby obliged (o
make and specify, on the back of such writ, and no sheriff shall
be obliged to execute such writ before such indorsement ; and
that the defendant in the execution is liable for such poundage,
is strongly fortified by the recital in this section : " whereas,
it often happens that small sums only remain due upon judgments given for great sums and penalties, and, nevertheless,
in these cases, upon executing of writs of capias ad satisfacienduin, the sheriff demands and takes for his fee potundage for

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[United States v. Itinggold.]

the whole money for which such judgments are entered ; for
remedy whereof, be it enacted, &c."
But it is not necessary, in the present case, to decide whether in any, and in what cases the defendant in the execution
would be liable to the marshal for his poundage fees. For,
admitting the defendant to be liable ; if the plaintiff releases or
discharges him, and thereby deprives the marshal of all recourse to the defendant, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff would thereby make himself responsible for the poundage.
2. The next inquiry is, whelier the United- States, in this
respect, stjds upon a different footing than private'parties. It is said, the United States are not included in any
general statute; but that express provision must be made, or the
statute cannot al)l)ly to them. But a sufficient answer to this
is, that the statutes of Maryland do not, in terms, apply to individ ls or private parties, or designate which of the parties is
liable for the marshal's poundage. They only settle, that the
marshal is entitled to poundage ; and fix the rate of allowance.
It is undoubtedly a general rule, that no court can give a direct judgment against the United States for costs, in a suit to
which they are a party, either on behalf of any suitor, or any
officer of the government. 12 Wheat. 550, 6 Cond. Rep. 629.
But it by no means follows from this, that they are not liable
for their own costs. No direct suit can be maintained against
the United States. But when an action, is brought by the
United States, to recover money in the hands of a party, who
has a legal claim against them, it would be a very rigid principle, to deny to him the right of setting up such claini in a
court of justice, and turn him round to an application to congress. If the right of the party is fixed by the existing law,
there can be no necessity for an application to congress, except
for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity can exist,
when this right can properly be set 'up by way of defence, to a
suit 1)y the United States
This rule is fully recognized by this conrt in the case of the
United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Peters 16. That was, like this,
an action brought to recover a balance, certified at the treasury,
against the defendant, andihe set up, by way of defence, a claim
which had been rejected at the treastury, 1ir iervices as agent for
the payment of the navy pension ftinid; and to which claim this

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Ringgold I

court.thought him equitably entitled. It is there said by the
court, that this action is for a sum of iponey which happens to
be in the hands of the defendant, and the question is, whether
he shall be required to surrender it to the government, and then
-petition congress on the subject. The government seeks to
recover money from the defendant, to which he is equitably
entitled for services rendered. This court cannot see any right,
either legal or equitable, in the government, to the money, for
the recovery of whfich this action is brought.
If any thing more could be wanted to show how entirely
unsupported the present suit is, it will be found in the discharge
given by the president of the United States, of Gates, who was
held in custody- by the marshal, under the execution upon
which the poundage is now claimed.
This discharge, directed to'the marshal, after reciting that
Gates had complied with the requisites of the het of the 31 of
March 1817, authorised him to discharge the said Gates from
his' custody, and out of the prison.
This law (6 L. U. S.247) gives to the president full power
to order such discharge, upon such terms and conditions as he
may think proper, and the party shall not be imprisoned again
for the same debt.
The discharge in this case is absolute and unconditional,
and the marshal had no authority to hold him in custody afterwards. So that, admitting Gates to have been liable for 'these
poundage fees, the marshal's power or right to compel payment
from him, was taken, away by authority of the United States,
the plaintiff in the suit. And the right of the marshal to
claim his poundage fees, from them is thereby clearly established.
The judgment of the circuit court is accordingly affirmed.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Waishington,
and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is
ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the
said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed.
