SUPREME COURT.

ALEXANDER B. SHANKLAND, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR VS. THE
MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMON COUNCIL OF WASHINGTON, DEFENDANTS IN ERROR.
The plaintiff was the owner of a half ticket in "the fifth class of the National
Lottery," authorized by the charter granted by congress to the cityof Washington. The number of the original ticket was 5591, whici drew a prize of twenfive thousand dollars. The whole ticket was in the hands of Gillespie, to
whom all the tickets in the lottery had been sold by the corporation of Wash.
ington; and his agent issued the half ticket, which was signed by him as the
agent of Gillespie, the purchaser of allthe tickets in the lottery. After the
drawing of the prize, and before notice of the interest of any other person in
the ticket No. 5591, Gillespie returned the original ticket to the managers, or
commissioners of the lottery, and the agents of the corporation, and received
back from the corporation an equivalent to the value of the prize drawn by it,
in securities deposited by hin with the corporation for the payment of the
prizes in the lottery. Held. that the corporation of Washington were not liable for the payment of half of the prize drawn by ticket No. 5591, to the owner of the half ticket.
The purchaser of tickets in a lottery, authorized by an act of congress, has a right
'to sell any portion of such ticket, less than the whole. The party to whom the
sale has been made would thus Become the joint owner of the ticket thus divided, but not a joint owner by virtue of a contract with the corporation of
Washington, but with the purchaser in his own right, and on his own account.
The corporation promise to pay the whole prize to the possessor of the whole
ticket, but there is-no.promise on the face of the whole ticket that the corporation will pay any portion of a prize to any subholder of a share: and it is not
in the power of a party, merely by his own acts, to split up a contract into
fragments, and to make the protnisor liable to every holder of a fragment for a
share. "
'It is certainly very difficult to maintain, that in a court of law any parol evidence
is admissible, substantially to change the purport and effect of a written instrument, and to impose upon it a sense which its terms not only do not imply, but expressly repel.
It is a general rule of law that a delegated authority cannot be delegated.
This case came before the court under an unusual agreement of the parties, by

JANUARY TERM 1831.

391 -

[Shankland vs. The Corporation of Washington.]

The facts of the case, with the exception of those stated more
particularly in the opinion bf the court, in this caser are the
same with those of the case of Clark against the Corporation of
Washington, reported in 12 Wheat. 40.
The case was argued by Mr Wirt and Mr Swann for the
plaintiff; and by Mr Jones and Mr Key for the defendants.
Mr Justice STony delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a writ of error to the circuit court of the district of
Columbia, sitting in the county of Washington. The original
action was brought by the plaintiff in error, to recover the
amount of one half of the prize of twenty-five thousand dollars, which was drawn in a lottery authorized by the corporation of Washington, by ticket No. 5591, of which the plaintiff asserted himself to be the owner and possessor in the
manner hereafter stated. The declaration was for money had
and received; and it was agreed by the parties to state a case,
and if upon the case so stated, the court should be of opinion
that the corporation were liable to the plaintiff for the half of
the prize sued for, judgment should be rendered upon the declaration for the amount due him accordingly. It was further
agreed that the question of th6 admissibility, competency, nd
sufficiency of the evidence to maintain th6 action, should be
submitted to the court: and that in considering the evidence,
the court should draw from -it, so far as it was admissible and
competent, every inference of fact and law which it would
have been competent for a jury to have drawn from it. Upon.
this case the circuit court gave judgmeht for the corporation,
and the present writ of error is brought to review that judgment.
The loctery was the same which was brought before this
court for consideration in the case of Clark vs. The Corporation of Washington, 12 Wheat. 40; and the leading facts
being the pame, it is unnecessary to do more than advert to
those facts which are peculiar to this case, and furnish the
ground of argument to distinguish it from the former.
The decision in that case was, that the lottery was the lottery
of the corporation; that the tickets issued were the tickets of
the corporation, contained a promise of the corporation;

[Shankland vs. The Corporation of Washington.]

made by its authorized agent to pay such prizes as should
be drawn by them; that the sale of all the tickets in the
lottery to Gillespie, under the contract made by him with
'the managers, wis not a sale of an independent right to draw
the lottery for himself, and on his own responsibility alone,
but was in effect a sale of the profits of the lottery for a given'
sum. And the reasoning in the case shows that Gillespie became the absolute owner of all the whole tickets signed in behalf of the corporation and delivered to him, but not of those
unsigned; and of course the possessors of such signea tickets,
whether himself or subsequent purchasers, were entitled to the
prizes drawn to them from the corporation as promisees. If,
therefore, the plaintiff in the present case had been the possessor of the whole ticket which drew the prize of twenty-five
thousand dollars, he would have been clearly entitled to recover it from the corporation. But the whole ticket was in
the hands of Gillespie, as possessor; and it was (as the state of
the facts shows), delivered by him to the corporation, after
the prize was drawn, without any notice on their part
of any sub-interest in another; and that upon such delivery
rillespie received back from the corporation. an equivalent
value in securities, previously deposited by him with the corporation for the payment of prizes. As between Gillespie and
themselves, the 'corporation -have paid, the prize; they have
paid it to the possessor according to the terms of the ticket;
and the question is whether, under these circumstances, they
are still liable topay to the plaintiff as owner of the half ticket, one half of the amount, notwithstanding they niad no notice of his interest or title.
evidence in the case that all tickets sold in the lotIt is intery were sold by Gillespie, or his agents, and for his beuefit;
and all the moneys arising therefrom were received by him or
his agents. This was on his part a proper proceeding; for by
the very terms of the contract he was entitled to all the tickets
signed and delivered to him; and when he sold these tickets,
be sold them as owner, on his own account, having already
acquired a legal title thereto from the corporation.
No half or quarter tickets were ever signed or issued by the
managers of the lottery, or any of them. But it is in evidance that one Webb, as clerk of Gillespie, was in the habit

EShankland vs. The Corporation of Washington.]

of selling whole tickets, half tickets, and quarter tickets, and
that, as the clerk of Gillespie, he sold to the plaintiff one half
of the ticket No. 5591. The whole ticket No. 5591 was
signed by the president of the board of managers. The half
or sub-ticketrpurchased by the pltaintiff, was in the following
terms: "National Lottery,-Gjllespie's lottery office-No.
5591. This ticket will entitle, the possessor to one half of
such prize as may be drawn to its number, if demanded within
twelve months after the completion of the drawing; subject to a deduction of fifteen per cent; payable sixty days
after the drawing is finished. Washington city, February 7th,
1821. D. Gillespie, per John F. Webb:" and in the margin there was an abstract of the prizes to be drawn in the
lottery.
Does this sub-ticket constitute a contract by which the corporation were bound to pay half the prize to the possessor, or
is it the mere private contract of Gillespie? Upon the face
of the paper it purports to be a contract, not for or on behalf
of the corporation, 'but for and in behalf of Gillespie, by his
agent Webb? -Gillespie, and not the corporation, promises to
pay the half prize drawn to it. In what manner, then, can it
bind the corporation?
In the first place, it was entirely competent foi Gillespie to
enter into such a contract on his own account. As owner and
possessor of the whole ticket, if he had made saleof the whole,
it would have been on his owh account; for he who sells as
owner cannot in any just use of language be said to sell as
agent. He would have conveyed his own title, as he then
hIeld it, and not as agent of another. He would have substituted another as possessor and transferree, to whom the original promise -of the corporation would then have attached.
But Gillespie, as owner, had also a perfect right to sell any
portion of such ticket, less than the whole. The party to
whom he should sell would thus become a joint owner with
him; but not a joint owner in virtue of any new contract
made by the corporation, but by Gillespie, in his own right,
and on his own. account. The corporation promise to pay the
whole prize to the possessor of the whole ticket; but there is
fio promise on the face of the-whole ticket that tfie corporation vill pay any portion of the prize to any sub:holder of a

share; and it is not in the power of a party merely by his own
acts to split up a contract into fragments, and to make the
-promisor liable to every holder of a fragment for his share.
The laiguhge of this court -in Mandeville vs. Weldh, 5
Wheat. 77, 286, leads to a very different conclusion. If
this had been the case of a bank note payable to bearer, there
is no pretence to say that a person claiming a moiety by contract with the bearer, could have maintained a suit against the
bank upon such contract for the moiety; when the note itself had
been surrendered up tb'the bank by the bearer. In what respect does such a case differ from the present? Suppose, after
this sub-ticket was issuedl Gil!esple had sold and delivered
.the whole ticket to another person, having no notice; would
not the latter have been entitled to recover the whole prize
from the corporation? If so, would the corporation still be
liable to pay _the half prize -to the plaintiff? If not, in what
respect does the case at bar differ in principle from that put;
since, inj legal effect, the prize has'been paid.to the real possessor of the whole ticket? By the contract contained on the
face of the whole ticket, the corporation promised to pay the
possessor of it the prize drawn by it. They have done so.
How then can their liability upon the face of the instrument
be extended to claims by persons entering into sub-contracts
with the holder of the ticket?
But in the next place, it is said that Gillespie was the agent
of the corporation in signing and issuing these sub-tickets; and
that they are therefore evidence of a contract by the corporation with the holder of the sub-ticket, that the corporation will
pay tfe proportion of the prizes drawn by them. Let us see
how far this proposition is borne out by the evidence. In
the first place, the only evidence of such a contract with the"
plaintiff, is the sub-ticket itself; and that, as we have seen,
purports on its face to be a contract, not of the corporation, but
of Gillespie. It is certainly very difficult to maintain, that in
a court of law any parol evidence is admissible substantially
to change the purpose and effect of a written instrument, and
to impose upon it a sense which its terms not only do not imply, but expressly repel. Even if it vere otherwise, there
is not the slightest evidence in this case that Webb was ever
-authorized..by the corporatioiito be their agent for any lur-

[Shankland 6B. The Corporation of Washington.]

pose whatsoever. On the contrary, Webb himself expressly
states, that he issued and sold this sub-ticket, and signed the
same, as clerk of, and for Gillespie; and he adds that all the
tickets sold in the lottery were sold for.the benefit of Gillespie. So that- his own view of the matter is that-he was the
agent, not of the corporation, but of Gillespie.
But it has been argued that Gillespie was himself the agent
of the corporation in the sale of the whole tickets, and by fair
implication, in the sale of the sub-tickets also; If it were so,
it would still be difficult to show that he had a right to delegate such authority to his clerk, or that without such delegation the act of the clerk bound the corporation; for the general
rule of law is, that a delegated authority cannot be delegated.
But waiving any consideration of this point, let us see
whether the evidence contains any such authority to Gillespie himself. In the first plac.e, did he act as agent of the corporation in selling the whole'tickets or as owner of them.
The evidence in thp case (as has been repeatedly stated) is
that he was the owfier of the whole tickets; thai he sold them
and received the moneys for them on his own account. And,
if he was the owner, it is difficult to perceive, how he could
act as agent of another in the sale of what was exclusively his
own property. But the whole tickets were signed by the
president of the managers, and with their consent; and thus
bound the- corporation' as the act of their authorized agbnt.
None of the sub-tickets were so signed or issued; but theywere signed in behalf of Gillespie only. This alone shows
that the managers did not cQnemplate the issue of any but
whole tickets to bind the corporation. If they had contemplated any issue of sub-tickets, why were the latter not also
signed by the president and delivered to Gillespie?
The contiact between the managers and Gillespie does not
contain any provision respecting the issue of sub-tickets; nor'
doesit appear that Gillespie ever requested the managers tosign
or deliver any. But it is said that it maybe inferred from the
other circumstances of the case, that Gillespie was authorized
to issue such sub-tickets; and the advertisements published in
the papers by Gillespie, in which he announces the prizes,
the names of the managers, and the offer of whole, half and
quarter tickets for sale, raise an irresistible presumption of the

SUPREME COURT.
[Shankland vs. The Corporation of Washington.)

fact. We do not think so. Those circumstances are, to say
the least, quite as consistent with the exercise of this right on
his own account, as with the exercise of any right as agent of
the corporation. He was owner of all the whole tickets; and
he certainly had a right to dispose of them in any manner
which he might deem best for his own interest, whether it was
in wholes, or halves, or quarters, or ahy other sub-divisions.
The corporation had no authority to obstruict or limit Rim in
the full exercise of this right; and any contract which he
,should make with third persons for the sale of sub-interests in
a single ticket, the corporation had as little to do with as they
would have with a contract to sell a hundred or thousand tickets
to the same persons. Their contract was to pay the possessor
of the whole ticket any prize which it might draw. Beyond
that, they-were not bound to inquire into or take notice of any
sub-interest, whether equitable or legal, acquired under Gillespie. In point of fact it should senm, as well from Webb's
tdstimony as from the conduct of Gillespie, that he so understood the matter; for there is no lvidence that he ever made
any returns to the managers of the issues of such sub-tickets,
or in any other manner consulted them on the subject; or that
they took any step to guard themselves from a double issue
of the whole ticket, or of sub-tickets of the same number.
When the managers-took so much care to lknit and control
the issue of whole tickets, by refusing to sign them except as
Gillespie furnished them with security for payment; is it to
be believed, that they had yet entrusted him with.an unlimited power to issue sub-tickets binding the corporation, which
might and indeed would defeat the whole effect of these precautions? It seems to us not; and the very form of the subticket itself, is strong corroborative evidence to repel the~presumption, that the corporation intended to bnd themselves
otherwise than by the written signature of one of their owh
managers, who were specially deputed to conduct 'the sale
and drawing of the lottery: and there is much reason to doubt
if the managers could have deputed their rights or duties in
this iespect to any third person, so that he could enter into
contracts for and to bind-the corporation.
Upon the whole, it is the opinion of the cour4 that the
plaintiff in this case is not entitled to recover, his contraet-

not being with the corporation or their agent, but solely with
Gillespie.
This view of the case renders it unnecessary to consider
the other question made at the bar, whether t&e lottery was or
was not illegal in its scheme and origin.
This cas6 has come before the court under an unusual agreement of the parties, by which matters of fact properly cognizable by a jury, are submitted to our judgment. We desire to
be understood as not admitting that it is competent for the
parties by any such agreement to impose this duty upon the
court. The peculiar circumstances of this case furnish a sufficient apology for this agreement. But it is not to be drawn
into precedent.
The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed, with costs.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington,'and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is
considered, ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same
is hereby affirmed, with costs.
