EDWVARD LIVINGSTON'S EXECUTRIX, APPELLANT V. BFoNxAmI
STORY.
Louisiana. On the 25th July, 1822, Livingston applied to, and obtained from Fort
& Story, a loan of 22,936 dollars, on a security of a lot of ground in New Orreans,
on which stores were then being built. This sum was received, part in cash, part
in a promissory note, and 8,000 dollars Were to be paid to the contractor'for finish.
ing the stores on the lot. The property was conveyed by Livingston, to Fort &
Story, by a deed of absolute conveyance; and he received from F. & S. a counter
leter, by which they promised to reconvey the property to him, if, on or before the
lst of February, 1823, he paid them 25,000 dollars. By the counter letter, on
payment of the loan, the property was to revert to L.; if not, it was to be
sold by an auctioneer of the city of New Orleans, and the residue of the pro.
ceeds of the same paid to L.; the money advanced by F. & S., with the interest
and the expenses, being first deducted, The agreement for building the storeswas transferred by L. to F. & S., and they agreed to pay the 8,000 dollars, as
the work proceeded, in instalments. On the 1st of Februaiy,1823, the buildings had not been completed, and F. & S. agreed that the payment of the sum
due on that day should be postponed until the 2d June, 1823; the sum of 25,000
dollars, to be increased to 27,500, being at the rate of eighteen per dent. per
annum, for four months, and the residue for expenses of selling the property at
auction, &c. An agreement was made, that if the amount named should not
be paid on the 1st of June, 1823, the property should be sold at auction, and after,
the reppyment of the sum of 27,500 dollars, the expenses of sale, &c., the residue
should be paid to L. By the same agreement, the counter letter was to be delivered up, and the record of it cancelled. On the 2d of June, the money not
being paid by L. to F. & S., it was agreed, that if on 6r before the 5th of August,
1823, the sum due, with interest, at eighteen per cent. per annum, to amount to
27,860 dollars, 76 cents, should not be laid by L. to F. & S., the lbt, and all the
buildings, should become the full and abslute property of F. & S. 'The money
was not paid; and F. &. S..protested, as they had done on the 4th of February, for
noncompliance with the agreement to pay the money agreed to be paid. From
this time, F. & S. continued in possession of the lot and the buildings, until the
feath of Fort, in 1828; when S. purchased the share which had belonged to F.,
and he holds the property to this time. The evidence in the case showed, that
after July, 1822, the contractor did not apply the 8,000 dollars to the completion of
the stores on the property; and although F. & S. knew that he was so neglect.
ing to apply the funds, they continued to pay over the same to him, in weekly
payments, according to the contract. In 1832, L. having become a citizen of New
York, filed a.bill in the district court of the United States, for the eastern district
of Louisiana, claiming to have the property held by S., reconveyed to him, on thie
payment to S. of the sum due to him, and interest on the same, deducting the
rents and profits of the estate; or that the same should be sold according to the
terms of the counter letter; and after the payment to S. of the amount due to him,
with interest, the same deductions'having beon made, that the balance remaining
from the sale should be so paid to him.. By the Court.-After much inquiry and

[Livingston v. Story.]
deliberation, and a comparison of the civil code of Louisiana, with the civil law
from which it derives its origin, and with which it is still in close connexion, we
have come to the conclusion that the original contract, and counter letter, constituted a pledge of real property; a kind of contract especially provided for by
the laws of Louisiana, denominated, " an antichresis." By this kind of contract,
the possession of the property is transferred to the person advancing the money.
That was done in this case. In case of failure to pay, the property is to be sold by
judicial process, and the sum which it may bring, over the amount for what it was
pledged, is to be paid to the person making the pledge. In this case a provision
was made for a sale by the parties, upon thQ failure of payment; but this feature
of the contract is rather confirmatory of the contract and counter letter being an
antichresis, than otherwise; for it is, at most, only a substitution by the parties of
what the laws of Louisiana require." The decree of the Court was in conformity
to those principles.
Under the law of Louisiana there are two kinds of pledges; the pawn, and the
antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned, when a movable is given as a security:
the antichresis is when the security given consists in immovables.
The antichresis must be reduced to writing. The creditor acquires by this contract
the right of reaping the fruits or other rewards of the immovables given to him in
pledge; on condition of deducting, annually, their proceeds from the interest, if
any be due to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt. The creditor is
bound, unless the contrary is agreed on, to pay the taxes, as well as the annual
charges of the property given to him in pledge. He is likewise bound, under the
penalty of damages, to provide for the keeping and necessary repairs of the pledged
estate; and may lay out, from the revenues of the estate, sufficient for such expenses.
The creditor does not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by the failure of
payment at the stated time; any clause to the contrary is null: and in that case,
it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor before the court in order to obtain a
sentence against him, and to cause the objects which have been put into his'hands
to be seized and sold.
The debtor cannot before the full payment of his debt, claim the enjoyment of the
immovables which he has given in pledge; but the creditor, who wishes to free
himself from the obligations under the antichresis, may always, unless he has renounced this right, compel the debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables.
The doctrine of prescription, under' the civil law, does not apply to this case, which
is one of pledge; and if it does, the time before the institution of this suit had not
elapsed, in w~hich, by the law of Louisiana, a Person may sue for immovable property.
The 23d rule of this Court for the regulation of equity practice in the circuit courts,
is understood by this Court to apply to matters applicable to the merits, and not to
mere pleas to the jurisdiction; and especially to those founded on any personal disability, or personal character of the party suing; or to any pleas, merely in abatement. The rule does not' allow a defendant, instead of filing a formal demurrer or
a plea, to insist on any special matter in his answer; and have also the benefit
thereof, as if he had pleaded the same matter, or had demurred to the bill. In this
respect, the rule is nierely affirmative of the general rule of the court of chancery;
in which, matters in abatement, and to the jurisdiction, being preliminary in their
nature, must be taken advantage of by plea, and cannot be taken advantage of in a,
general answer; which necessarily admits the right and capacity of the party to sue.

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

APPEAL from the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana.
The case, as stated in the opinion of the Court, was as follows:
The complainant, the appellant's testator, on the first day of February, 1834, filed a bill in equity in the district court of Louisiana, in
which he stated himself to be a citizen of the state of New York,
against Benjamin Story, a citizen of the state of Louisiana.
The bill charged, that some time previous to the 22d of July, 1822,
the complainant, being in want of money, applied to the defendant
and John A. Fort for a loan, offering as a security a lot in the city
of New Orleans, on which a building, intended for stores, had been
begun; that the defendant and Fort agreed to loan him twenty-two
thousand nine hundrcd and thirty-six dollars; of which apart only
was paid in cash, part in a note of John A. Fort, and eight thousand
dollars of which was afterwards agreed between himself, the defendant and Fort, to be paid by Story and Fort, to one John Rust, a mechanic, who had 'contracted with the complainant, to complete the
stores. That to secure the money borrowed, complainant conveyed
to Fort and Story the lot of ground mentioned, and that cotemporaneously with the deed of sale, they executed, on their part, an instrument in writing, called a counter-lette., by which they promised,
on the payment of twenty-five thousand dollars, on or before the
1st day of February, 1823, to reconvey to the complainant the property which he had conveyed to them. The complainant further
charges, that of the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars to be paid
by him on the 1st of February, a part of it was made up by a charge
of interest at eighteen- per cent. per annum, upon the amount of
twenty-two thousand nine hundred and thirty-six dollars, actually
advanced to hiu, and to be paid on his account to Rust, by Fort and
Story.
The complainant also transferred his written contract with Rust
to the defendant and Fort, rendering himself responsible for the
proper employment of the 8,000 dollars; and which was to be paid
Rust in weekly payments, by the defendant and Fort. Rust, on his
part, consented to the transfer of his contract, and accepted Fort and
Story in the place of the complainant. The stores were to be completed by Rust by the lit of November, 1822, in a workmanlike
manner; and all the materials, except those already provided, were
to be found by Rust; and in his contract, he renounces all claim or

Morse, and Miller, and Pierce, contaning one hundred and twenty feet, or thereabouts, the said parcel of ground sold, together with the buildings, improvements,
and all other appurtenances to the same in any wise appertaining or belonging

[Livingston v. Story.]

The complainant charges, that soon after the transactio n, he left
New Orleans; and that when he returned to it, he found that Fort
and Story had paid to Rust 8000 dollars, on his account, but that
little or nothing had been done toward the completion of the stores;
so that if the property had been sold on the first of February, according to the terms of the counter-letter, it, would not have probefore the st day of February, 1823, then, and in that case, the said Fort and Story
stipulate and bind themselves to reconvay the said property above described, to said
Edward Livingston. And in case of nonpayment of the said sum of twenty-five
thousand dollars, on or before the day as above stipulated, then the said Fort and.
Story covenant and agree to cause the said property-to be sold at public auction, by
one of the licensed auctioneers of this city, after twenty days' public notice, on the

duced any thing like its full value. That under these circumstances
he applied to Fort and Story for further time, which they would not
consent to, but on certain conditions; which were, that the property
should be-advertised for sale, on the 22d of June, 1823; that the sum
due them should be increased from 25,000 dollars to 27,500 dollars;
which was so increased by the addition of 1500 dollars " interest,
at eighteen .per cent. for five months, 800 dollars, for auctjoneer's
commissions, 50 dollars for advertising, and 150 dollarsr, arbitrarily
added by the said Fort and Story. The complainant states, that being
entirely at the mercy of Fort and Story, he consented to those terms,
and executed a paper accordingly.'
The bill further states, that the complainant, on the 2d of June, in
order to obtain a delay of sixty days, was forced to consent to sign
a paper, by which it was agreed that the debt should be augmented to
the sum of 27,830 dollars and 76 cents; and that if the same was not
paid on the 5th of August, then the property should belong to the
said Fort and Story without any sale.t But there is no clause by which
"Agreement between Edward Livingston, and John A. Fort and Benjamin Story

he should be discharged from the payment of the sum so borrowed
as. aforesaid, whereby he would have beef liable to the payment of
the sum so advanced in case the property had fallen in value; and
the bill states, that on the 5th day of August, abovementioned, the
said Fort and Story demanded, by a notary, the full sum of 27,830
dollars and 76 cents, which included the charge of 600 dollars for
auctioneers' commissions for selling, although no sale had taken
place, and all the other illegal charges above stated; and on nonpayment protested for damages and interest on the said sum, thereby
showing their intention to hold him responsible for the sum demanded, if the premises should, by any accident, become insufficient
in value to pay the same. Fort and Story remained in possession
of the said premises until the death of the said John A. Fort, which
took place some time in the year 1828; after his death the said Benjamin Story took the whole of the, said property by some arrangement with the heirs of the.said John A. Fort, and is now, and ever
since has been, in the sole possession thereof; and the bill charges, that
the said John and Benjamin, in the lifetime of the said John, and the
said Benjamin, aftei the death of the said John, have received the
rents and profits of the said property, to the amount of at least
60,000 dollars; and that the complainant is advised, and believes that
he has a right to ask and recover from the said Benjamin Story the
possession of the said property, and an account of the rents and
Edward.Livingston having requested that said sale might not take place, for his own
accommodation, the said Fort and Story hive agreed to the said Liv;ngston's request, on the following conditions, to wit: that on or before the 5ith day of August,
he, the said Livingston, shall pay to the said'Fort and Story, the whole amount of
the consideration money paid by them for the said lot. that is to say, the sum of
127,830 dollars 76 cents, and also any other sum they may be under the necessity of
paying for the preservation of the said property; then the lot and buildings to revert
to the said Livingston, and to become his property: and in case the said Livingston
should fiLil, on the day abovementioned, to wit, the 5th day of August next, to pay to
the said Fort and Story the sums above specified, then and in thftt case the said lot
with all the buildings thereon, are to bbcome the full and absolute property of the
said Fort ind Story; and the said Livingston hereby engages thereupon to surrender
and cancel all and every writing or bther document, in relation to said property, that
may give to him any equity of redemption or other right to the same premises, it
being the true intent and meaning of the parties, that in case of failure of payment,
as afbresaid, that said lot, with all the buildings and appurtenances to the same belonging, are to vest in said Fort and Story a full title in fee simple forever.
Thus done ,and passed-in my office, on the day, month, and year above written, in

having been. made on a contract for the loan -of money, and although
in the form of a sale, in reality only a pledge for the repayment of
the same-' the act by which he agreed to dispense with the sale being
void and of no effect in -law.
The bill also prayed, "That an account may be taken, under the
direction of this honourable court, between your orator and the
.defendants to this bill, in which your orator agrees he shall be
charged:
"1st. With such sum'as shall be shown to have been advanced to

day of July, 1822, with the interest which he agreed to pay, of
eighteen per cent. per annum, to be calculated upon each advance
from the time it was mlide until the 5th of August, 1823, and after
that time at legal interest.
"2d. With all reasonable expenditures judiciously made and incurred by the said John and Benjamin, in building, repairing, and
safe keeping of the-said property, and that your orator be credited
in such account with all such sums as the said John and Benjamin,
or either of them,,have received, or might, if they had used due diligence and care, have received from the said property; and that, in
such account, the rents and profits be applied as the law requires:
first, to the payment of the sums necessarily incurred in building
and repairing; secondly, to the payment of interest on the sums
which shall appear to have been advanced on the said loan; and,
thirdly, to the discharge of the principal of the said loan.
"And that if, on said account, it shall appear that there is a
balance due him, as he hopes to be able to show will be the case, that
the said Benjamin Story he decreed to pay the same to him, and to

due from the complainant, that the said B. Story may be decreed to
delivdr the said property to him, on his paying or tendering to him
the said balance; and that he may have such other relief as the nature of his case may require. That le, the said Benjamin Story, in
his own right, and also as executor of the last will and testament of
the said' John A. Fort, or in any other manner representing the estate of the said John A. Fort, may be summoned to answer this bill;

Louisiana, and now resides in New Orleans."

[Livingston v. Story.]

The protests, made at the request of John A. Fort and Benjamin
Story, on the nonpayment of the money stipulated to be paid by
Edward Livingston, on the 1st of February, 1823, stated, that on
that day the notary had requested from Edward Livingston, payment
of the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, and was answered, that
'he could not immediately pay the sum due to Fort and Story, but
that he hoped soon to be able to do it." The answer to the demand
made, stated in the protest of the 5th of August, 1823, to have been
given by Edward Livingston was, "that owing to the very extraordinary scarcity of money, he was prevented repaying the money he
had borrowed from Messrs. Fort and" Story. at this time, but was
willing to allow them the same interest, at eighteen per cent, with
good personal security, in addition to the real property they now
have, for the renewal of the obligation for six months."
On the 17th of February, 1-834, Benjamin Stofy appeared to the
bill, and demurred to the same; alleging for cause of the demurrer,
that the case made in the bill was not such a one as entitled the
claimant in a court of equity of the state of Louisiana, to any discovery touching the matters contained in the bill, or any'ofher matters, nor. to any relief; and that by complainant's own showing in the
said bill, that the heirs of John A. Fort, who is therein named, is a
necessary party to the said bill; as much as it is therein stated, that
all the matters of which he complains, were transacted with this defendant and John A. Fort, whose widow, the present Mrs. Luzenburg, is the sole heir and residuary legatee.
The district court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill,
on two grounds;
1st. "That this is not a suit that can be maintained in its present
form, in a court'of the United States, sitting in Louisiana."
2d. "That a material party is omitted in the bill."
The complainant appealed to the Supreme Court, and at January
term, 1835, the decree of the district court was reversed; and the case
remanded for further proceedings. 9 Peters' R. 632. On'the 15th of
December, 1835, Benjamin Story filed in the district court of Loiisiana, an answer, on oath, to the original bill, in which he says, :hat'
he does not admit, but if it be the fact, requires proof that the complainant is a citizen of -the state of New York, that at the time of
the transaction mentionql in the bill, and for a long time thereafter,
he was a citizen of the state of Louisiana, and one of her senators
in the senate of the United States; and if he.has ceased to be a citi-

zen of that state, the defendant knows not when or how, and calls
for the proof.
And this defendant further answering, says, that he expressly denies, that on or about the 25th July, 1822, that he and John A. Fort
agreed to lend to the complainant the sum of twenty-two thousand
nine hundred and thirty-six dollars, or any other sum.
That he expressly denies, that any time, either jointly with the
said Fort, or this defendant separately, ever agreed to lend to the
said complainant any suum of money whatever, as alleged in the bill
of complainant.
That so far from there having been any loan intended by the parties, this defendant states, that the negotiation for the sale -of the said
lot, commenced between John A. Fort and Nathan Iorse, Esq.,
since deceased, the latter acting for the said complainant; and that
one of them informed this defendant that the complainant wished to
raise money on mortgage; but this defendant peremptorily and expressly refused to advance any money whatever to the complainant
on mortgage. That during the progress of the negotiation, the complainant having learned that the defendant was to be interested in
the purchase, and was to make the principal payments, mentioncd to
this defendant, that he would prefer obtaining mojiey by mortgage
dn the property, rather than make a sale of it; and this defendant
again repeated to him his refusal, and insisted upon a sale being made
to him.
As evidence of the understanding of the parties, and of the real
nature of the transaction, certain communications which had been
addressed by the alleged agent of 1IVr. Livingston to John A. Fort
and Story, were annexed to the answer.*
To JOHN A. FoRT, Esq., Present.

Messrs. John A. Fort and Story will oblige Mr. Livingston by sending in writing,
their definitive terms, that isWhat sum will they give in cash: what sum they retain in their own hands to appropriate towards the building: what sums, and at what periods they give their
notes: that they must have an absolute sale of the lot and buildings free from all
incumbrances, and a transfer of the contract, and are to be put in immediate possession: the property to be returned in case the money is refunded punctually, at the

1822, containing the clause of non enumerata petunia. The answer
refers to the difierent documents which have been stated, and referred to in the complainant's case.
The money not being repaid, as was provided-in the counter-letter
on the 2d of February, 1823, no sale of the property was made by
auction, because of the request of the complainant; and on the 4th
of March they made another agreement, (note ante, page 356,) by
which they agreed to postpone the sale of the property until the 2d
of June, 1823; and the said Ed,.iard Livingston, in conideration of
allowing him such additional chance to repurchase the said lot and
buildings, or obtain some person to purchase it, agleed to pay to
them a compensation therefor, as is in said agreement stipulated; and
in this agreement it is covenanted between the parties, that the counter-letter should be annulled and given up, so that there then existed
between the parties the absolute bill of sale, and this stipulation of
4th of March, 1823. And finally, the 2d day of June, 1823, having
arrived, and Edward Livingston would not pay the price of said
property, nor was thcre any offer therefor, and at his request an
agreement was entered into before H. Lavcrgne, a notary public,
whereby 'he said Edward Livingston requested that the dale might
not take place for his accommodation, and the said Fort and Story
agreed thereto, on the following conditions: that on or before the 1st
day of August, 1823, the said Edward Livingston should pay the
said sum of twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars
and seventy-six cents, and any further sum by them expended for
the care and preservation of said property, and that then the said lot
and buildings were to become the property of said Livingston; and
in case the said Livingston should fail on the 5th August, 1823, to
pay to the said Fort and Story the sums above specified, then the
said lot, with the buildings thereon, were to become the full and absolute property of Fort and Story, and the said Livingston engaged
thereupon to surrender and cancel all and every writing or other
document in relation to said property, that might give to him any
equity of redemption or other right to the said premises; it being in
said act expressly stated, that it was the true intent and meaning of
the parties, that in the case of failure of payment as aforesaid, that
said lots, with all tie buildings and appurtenances to th0 same belonging, are to vest in said Fort and Story a full, free, and absolute
title in fee simple forever.

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

The answer denied that at the time of the purchase, the property
was worth more than the money Fort and Story paid for it, and that
any loan of money was made; but it was an absolute sale, with power
to redeem, which was twice extended to the complainant, and was
finally closed by the last agreement; and on the 5th of August, 1823,
a demand was made, and'payment refused; whereby all clauses of
redemption were annulled, by articles 93, 94, of the act then in force
in Louisiana, and the property became absolutely and irrevocably
the property of Fort and Story.
The answer also denies that the property has become as valuable
as is represented by the complainant; and it states, that on the 10th of
March, 1832, he, the respondent, by a purchase from the widow of
John A. Fort, now Mrs. Luzenburg, became the owner of the moiety
of the property which had belonged to John A. Fort, for which the
sum of fifty thousand dollars was to be paid. A liability by Mrs. Luzenburg and her husband to repay this money in case of eviction, is
alleged to exist under the laws of Louisiana, and that the purchaser
has a right, under those laws to call on the vendor, to assist in his defence; "and the respondent submits to the Court, .-ihether by the
proceedings having been instituted in the district court of the United States, Mrs. Luzenburg is to be precluded from claiming and
defending the ownership, when, being vendor, she is interested in the
case."
The answer prays a citation to the widow of John A. Fort, who
intermarried with Dr. Luzenburg; that they may appear and defend
the sale, and abide by any decree of the Court.
To the answer, is annexed a statement of the moneys paid and received, on account of the estate, by the respondent, and John A.
Fort. The sums paid for the estate from July 26, 1822, to May 27,
1827, amounted to fifty-one thousand five hundred and thirty-seVen
dollars and twenty"ients, the interest at ten per cent., which is twen-'
ty-six thousand two hundred and sixty-one dollars and twelve cents;
total seventy-seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight dollars
and thirty-two cents; the sums received, up to January 26, 1829,
amount to twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and five dollars and
sixty-nine cents--interest seven thousand and seventy-three dollars
and eighteen cents. Total thirty-six thousand seven hundred .and
seventy-eight dollars and eighty-seven cents. The answer claims
the benefit of the proscription of five or ten years, under the laws of
Louisiana, as constituting a bar to the suit

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

Afterwards, on the 14th of March, 1836, the defendant filed an
amended answer, stating, that Mary C. Luzenburg, the widow of
John A. Fort, deceased, had, since the filing of the original answer,
set up a claim to the moiety of the estate in controversy, and had
instituted a suit in the judicial district court of the state of Louisiana,
against the respondent, for the purpose of vacating the contract by
which he became invested with a title to the interest of which Fort
died possessed, and to recover the same from him; and as the claim
is not admitted, but in the event of the success of the appellant, she
and her husband would be liable to the respondent, and consequently,
the rights of the respective parties could not be fully, fairly, and
finally decided, unless Luzenburg and wife be made parties to this
suit. The amended answer prays they may, by the complainant, be
made parties to the bill.
A copy of the bill of Mrs. Luzenburg to the judge of the district
court of the first judicial district of.the state of Louisiana, is annexed
to the amended answer. It alleges a sale of the moiety of the property
which belonged to John A. Fort, to have been made to Benjamin
Story, on the 10th of March, 1832, for fifty thousand dollars; whtn
in truth and in fact, the said moiety was worth one hundred thousand
dollars.
The testimofty of two witnesses was taken in open court. Hughes
Lavergne, the notary before whom many of the documents in the
case had been executed, deposed, "Mr. Nathan Morse came to his
office accompanied by Mr. Story, at the period named, for the purpose of making the sale above referred to. Mr. Morse appeared in
this transaction to be the legal adviser of Messrs. Story and Fort;
at this time Mr. Livingston was and had been for some time a member of the New Orleans bar, of great practice and celebrity, and it
was not probable that Livingston would employ a lawyer to advise
him.
Cross-examined by the defendant's counsel to the question, if-deponent does not know that Mr. Morse was the financial agent of Mr.
Livingston? He answers that he does not know that he was.
Money was very scarce in New Orleans, in 1822.
"H. Lockett, Esq. the agent of Mr. Livingston, deposed, that the
complainant has not been in Louisiana since 1829; that he has wriAten to deponent often, that he had changed his domicil to New York;
he has property there and votes there.
"Cross-examined: 'deponent states, that Mr. Livingston was the

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

senator from Louisiana until the year 1831, when he was appointed
secretary of state at Washington; it was then that Mr. Livingston
changed his domicil to the state of New York; deponent never saw
Mr. Livingston in New.York, as he has never been there; but he
has received letters, and still receives letters from E. Livingston,
dated and postmarked New York."
On the 3d of June, 1836, the district court made a decree, that the
bill of the complainant should be dismissed.
The complainant, Edward Livingston, having died, his executrix
was made a party to the proceedings, and she prosecuted this'appeal.
The case was argued by Mr. White for the appellant, and by Mr.
Crittenden and Mr. Clay for the appellee.
Mr. White for the appellant.
An attempt is made by the appellee to raise up a question of jurisdiction in this case. If the right of Mr. Livingston to sue in the
court of the United States in Louisiana, resting upon his having
been a citizen of that state when the suit was commenced, is contezted$
the exception should have been presented to the district court of the
United States in Louisiana, by a plea to the jurisdiction. Proof
could then have been regularly given, that he became a citizen of
New York in 1831, and continued such until his death, in 1836.
Proof of this is in the record.
The whole of this attempt is made to cover the real character of
this transaction; and it is sought to make it a sale of the property)
and not a loan, as the penalties of usury are heavy under the laws
of Louisiana. The facts of the case show that it was a loan by John
A. Fort and Benjamin Story, to Mr. Livingston; of this the Court
will be fully satisfied.
Nothing is so common under the civil law, as to make a deed of
absolute transfer of real estate, and to t.ike an agreement from the
tender of the money, to secure whom the deed is made, which is called
"a counter-letter." This is an advantage to the borrower; it puts him
in possession of the evidence of the real nature of the transaction,
and gives him full power over the deed of conveyance. The counter-letter is the contract between the parties. In this case it contradicts the answer of the defendant to the plaintiff's bill. He says it
was an absolute sale of the land. That is entirely disproved by the
counter-letter. The counter-letter shows it was not a sale, but

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

a loan oin the seturity of the real estate; and the law of Louisiana
takes charge of the borrower, and will not allow him, under the
pressure of his difficulties, to surrender the protection the law gave
him. A sale by an auctioneer, or a judicial sale, is required; and ibis
the borrower cannot relinquish.
The purpose of the lenders was to embarrass the borrower, and
thus prevent the redemption of the property. The stores were not
completed, as they ought to have been; and as the contractor, Rust,
should have been obliged by Fort and- Story to tomplete them; they
having an assignment of the contract for their completion. Nothing
was done by them. Had the contract With Rust been insisted upon,
and the stores completed, ample means to pay the whole sum borrowed would have been in possession of Mr. Livingston. The extravagant interest which was made a part of the consideration for the
loan, would have been fully paid; and this most willingly. The appellant has no wish to escape from the payment of that interest; and
he has instructed his counsel -et to ask any thing which will prevent its allowance, according to the agreement.
The property, at the time of the transaction, was far greater in
value than the amount loaned by Fort and Story. In 1832, it was
worth one hundred thousand dollars. It is now of much greater
value5 and all the appellant asks, is, that she may be allowed to repay
to the lenders, all they advanced, all they expended, and the legal
interest on the amount since the debt became payable; taking back
the estate, and having the advantage of the proceeds of it since that
time. No injustice will be done by this settlement; and .all parties
should be satisfied with it.
This was not a conditional sale of the property by Mr. Livingston. It was a pledge of real estate, which cannot be enforced by a
sale of the pledge without a judicial proceeding. This is what, in
the civil law of Spain, is called "antichresis."
The code of law prevailing in Louisiana, is difficult to be understood. It has gr6wn up since the first establishment of the province.
Originally it was adopted by a proclamation of Governor O'Riley,
in 17685 and was afterwards confirmed by the king of Spain. This
was "The Corpus jure Civilis," and the "Partidas," and "The Recopilacion de leyes de las Indias." The French inhabitants of the province bbcame dissatisfied, and the "Les Coutumes de Paris," wdre
declared to furnish the rules of practice: the principles of the established laws to remain in full force.

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Stoly.]

This was the state of things when the United States acquired the
territory; and great embarrassments arose on the introduction of the
provisions of 'the laws of the United States, and the forms of proceedings under the same. A code was prepared by authority of the
legislature of the state, which is called the civil code, and is in most
of its provisions the code Napo]eon; and allows the Spanish laws to
prevail, in all cases to which they will apply.
By the civil laws of Spain, the transaction was an antichresis; and
by these laws Mr. Livingston was to be treated as a minor, and
could, by no acf of-his, change the contract, far less dissolve or annul
it. Civil laws of Spain, translated by Johnson, 149, 156. "A pledge
must be sold by some judicial process. The right of property in a
pledge cannot be transferred, except by some judicial proceeding,
whatever may be the stipulations between the parties;" lb. 159. The
counter-letter stipulates that the surplus shall go to Mr. Livingston.
Civil Code of Lou. article Pledge; tit. 22, art. 3100.
In article 3143, Civil Code of Louisiana, will be found the regulations relative to unremovable pledges, called antichreses; and
article 3146, declares, that any clause which passes the property
of a debtor on a failu're to pay, is inoperative and void. At common law, the mortgagee may become the owner of the property
by a-release of the equity of redemption; but the civil law does not
allow this.
Mr. White then read to the Court, an argument prepared by Mr.
Hunt, of New Orleans, who was the counsel for Mr. Livingston, in.
the district court of Louisiana; to show the character of the loan,
by the laws of the state of Louisiana, derived as they are from the
laws of Spain and of France; and contending, that by the provisions
of the law, the property was pledged, not sold; cited, 4 Kent's Com.
135, 136; Civil Code, S62, ch. 5, art. 91; Ibid. 344; 2 Vez. 405;

N. S. 21, 4.
The authorities referred to in this argument, show that the whole
transaction was one protedted by the law.
The protests which Fort and Story made on the nonpayment of
the sum borrowed, were intended to destroy the credit of the borrower; and thus prevent his obtaining from other sources the funds
reauired for the redemption of the property.

[Livingston v. Story.]

In the case cited from 2 Martin's Reports, N. S. 21, 4, the Court
will find the opinion of Judge Porter, showing that a right to land
pledged, cannot be acquired without some judicial proceeding; and
so all measures to destroy the rights of the original owner of the
property, will be of no avail. Once a mortgage, always a mortgage;
cited 4 Miller's Lou. Rep. 3, as to the nature and effect of a counterletter.
Mr. Crittenden, for the defendant.
This is a suit in Chancery which has heretofore been before this
Court. After it was remanded, the Louisiana court proceeded to
enforce the decision of this Court. The defendant filed "his answer
to the complainant's bill, to which the complainant replied, and the
cause was tried on its merits, and the court dismissed the bill with
costs, from which this appeal is prosecuted.
The case attempted to be made out by the complainant in his bill,
is, that he made a loan of the defendant and a certain Fort, was to
,give them an exorbitant interest; and, as a security for the repayment of the money advanced to him, that he conveyed the lot, which
is the subject of controversy, in New Orleans, in mortgage.
On the contrary, the defendant denies, peremptorily and positively, that the transaction was a loan; and avers that he and his associate, Mr. Fort,-absolutely refused to make any loan to the complainant. He denies that the conveyance of thd lot in dispute is a
mortgage. He alleges that the lot was purchased by him and his
associate of the complainant; with a privilege secured to him of repurchasing it by a given day. That this privilege, although extended
from time to time, was never exercised by him; and that the lot,
therefore, became the absolute property of the defendant and his
associate.
The whole controversy, so far as the merits are concerned, turns
upon the fact, whether the parties to the transaction intended a sale
of the property, or a loan; and the conveyance of the lot as a security
for the reimbursement of that loan.
The complainant sues as a citizen of the state of New York, and
the defendant denies that he was a cftizen of that state at the time of
the commencement of the suit. The proof attempted on this point
by the complainant is irregular, and not to be regarded. -With the
exception of that testimony, all the evidence is documentary. The
transaction originated in an absolute conveyance of the property,

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston y. Story.]

with a separate instrument, called 'a counter-letter, both under date
of the 25th July, 1822; and by the1r terms it was to have been consummated on the 1st of February, 1823; but at the instance of
Livingston, and it virtue of new agreements, materially variant
from the first, this consummation was deferred to the 2d of June,
and then to the 5th of August, 1823. 13y these new agreements, the
counter-letter of the 25th of July, 1822, was annulled; and it was
finally settled between the parties, that if Livingston paid the'sum
specified on or before the said 5th of August, 1823, the property
should (Irevert to said Livingston and become his property;" and
that if he should fail to pay by that day, then that said lot and appurtenances to be the "absolute property of the said Fort and Story;"
the said Livingston to surrender and cancel every "writing or document that might give him any equity of redemption, or other right
to the said premises: it being the true intent and meaning of the
parties" that, in case of the failure of payment, &c., the said lot and
appurtenances "are to vest in the said Fort and Story a full title in
fee simple forever."
The m-in question in the cause turns upon the law of Louisiana,
where the civil law prevails, and where they have no code of equity,
nor of common law: except as it has been introduced, in a very
limited extent, since the annexation of Louisiana to. the United
States.

suit.
It is denied that the court had jurisdiction of the case; as Mr.
Livingston was, at the time the suit was brought, a citizen of Louisi.
ana. The answer denies his citizenship, and the proof which was
given on the part of Mr. Livingston, by no. means shows he had
ceased to belong to Louisiana.
The appellees have full right to raise the, question of jurisdiction
here. Jurisdiction was denied in the district court, and evidence
given upon the question. - The Court will look at that evidence. If
there is no jurisdiction, the Court will dismiss the cause. Having

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

been brought into question, and the whole of the testimony appearing which was given to establish it; this Court will consider the
point as regularly before them; cited Brown v. Keene, 8 Peters, 125.
It is known, that when Mr. Livingston became the secretary of
state, he was a citizen of Louisiana. While at the city of Washington, he could not acquire, the right of -a citizen in any other state;
although it is admitted that a residence at Washington in the public
service, could not affect his citizenship in the state from which he
came. He could only become a citizen of New York, by actual
residence there; and this did not take place until after he filed the
bill in this case, in the district court of the United States for the
eastern district of Louisiana. As to jurisdiction, cited 4 Cond. Rep.
127, note. Brown v. Keene, 8 Peters, 125.
The appellee, in this case, is protected by time. This suit was
not brought until ten years- after the transaction between the parties
was closed. Civil Code of Louisiana, 302. The allegation of the
operation of the act oti limitation is in the case, and the Court will
regard it.
Upon the merits of the case, the question will be, whether the arrangement between Mr. Livingston, and Fort and Story, was a sale of
the property, or a pledge. The appellee asserts it to have been originally a conditional sale; which afterwards was made absolute by
Mr. Livingston, who had a perfect right to make it such.
The provisions of the civil law, and of the Louisiana code, which
have been referred to by the counsel for the appellant, apply to mortgages. If this was a case of mortgage, then the ability of the mortgagor to change it, and relinquish his right to have a judicial sale of
the property, may exist.
It is difficult, under the common law, to distinguish between a conditional sale, and a mortgage. What this is, must be decided by
the code, and by the decisions of Louisiana.
The counter-letter speaks of the deed from Mr. Livingstonas a
conveyance; and the recital admits the transaction to be a sale. The
purpose of the counter-letter, was to secure a reconveyance.
If the civil law allowed Mr. Livingston the ability to cancel the
counter-letter, the evidence to shovi that he did so, and waived his
right of redemption, is conclusive. The authorities cited by the
counsel for the appellant, apply to admitted mortgages; and they
have no application to this transaction, which never was a mortgage.
VOL. XI.-3 A

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

But'if it had been such, still the kight to release the equity of redemption,-existed; and under the civil law, that right may, by agreement, be extinguished. Civil Code of Louisiana, 472.
The civil code of Louisiana, of 1808, was in force when this transaction took place. The provisions which apply to it, will be found
in pages 344, and in 272, 274. The contract comes within the definitions of a conditional sple, in the articles referred to. A sale is,
where one agrees to give a thing or property for a particular- sum of
money. This was a sale; but subject to an expressed condition,
which suspended its operation for a certain time, within which the
vendor had a right, expressly reserved, to cancel it.
The papers all show it was such a sale., It is no where called a
mortgage, or a security for money loaned. The counter-letter does
not contain an engagement to repay the money received from' the
purchaser of the property. The deed is absolute. The only stipulation is that of Fort and Story, to reconvey the property; but there
is no obligation on the part of Mr. Livingston, to repay the money
he had received. It is essential that there should -have been such an
agreement, to constitute a loan. Both parties, in the case of a loan,
are bound; one to receive the money, when offered, the other to repay it, according to the agreement. It would be vain to search for
such provisions'in the instruments executed by the parties. They
import any thing but such an arrangement.
But if, originally, it was not a sale, it afterwards became such.
The surrender of the counter-letter, and the subsequent agreement
of the parties, converted it into an absolute transfer of the estate; and
this, after all the indulgence which Mr. Livingston had asked, had
been fully conceded to him. The postponement from the 4th of
March, 1823, was made at the instance of Mr. Livingston, and on
entering into the agreement; which, after a further postponement
from June to August, in the same year, he terminated, with his free
and full consent; gaye up all his right or claim on the property. The
rights of Fort and Story thereby became absolute and irrevocable.
It is contended, that although this agreement was made, yet by the
civil law it was of no avail, and was void. If this is not the law,
then the agreement must have full effect. The Court must be satisfied that this is the law of Louisiana; and unless they are so satisfied, the decree of the district court will be affirmed.
The authorities referred to by the counsel for the appellant, if they
have any application, apply to loans on mortgage, and they may show

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

371

[Livingston v. Story.]

that, in case of a mortgage, such agreements are void. They can
have no other application.
It is true, that once a mortgage always a mortgage; but certainly
a party may give up his right of redemption; Code of Louisiana,
472. Mortgages may be extinguished by raction or agre6ment.
This is a paction, or agreement.
By the original agreement between the parties, the property was
to be put up to sale; but Mr. Livingston afterwards gave this up,
considering that this would be more advantageous than to offer the
property for sale. Mr. Livingston was fully competent to do.this;
and yet it is contended by the appellant, that by some law of Louisiana, the power to do so is taken away.
If the transaction was a sale on condition, then it is not asserted
that Mr. Livingston had no power to make it absolute. The civil
code of Louisiana is explicit to this effect.
The very form of a sale, on condition, has been adopted in this
case. The deed is an absolute and complete transfer; the couniterletter declares the conditions of the sale. This, by the civil 6ode, is
a paction, by which the vendor reserves the right to take back the
property; and in the instrument the very terms of the law are
adopted. May I not sell my property, on a condition that if I do
not repay the money named, the estate shall be sold by auction; the
proceeds of the sale to repay the same, and I to receive the residue?
This may be done biy our laws.
Courts of chancery have sought to make such a. transaction between parties, more than they intended it to be: but the law of Louisiana will not allow this; Title Mortgage, art. 1, 452; art. 6, 452.
Under the law of Louisiana, no conditional mortgage can exist
between parties, except that which .is expressly stipulated. None
can be inferred from any thing but the express agreement of the parties. Authorities will sustain these positions; 1 Martin's Rep., New
Series, 522, 528.

Strong apprehensions have prevailed in Louisiana, that in consequence of the decisions of this Court, in cases from the district of
Louisiana, the laws of Louisiana are not to govern the cases which
may be brought hbre; but that they are to be decided by the chancery law of other states, and biy the chancery laws of England.
This is an error in those who entertain such apprehensions. The
courts of the United States adopt the forms of proceeding in ehan-

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

cery cases, where they are brought into those courts; but they will
apply the laws of the place to contracts made under them.
It.has been said that the civil code of Louisiana is but a part of
the law of that state, and that they have there, in full application, the
corpus juris civilis, and the Partidas of Spain. Whatever system
of laws prevailed before 1808, after that time the laws then established alone prevailed. After that time we are not to look to the
laws of Spain, or of any part of the continent of Europe. In the
formation of the code then adopted, such of the provisions of those
laws as were approved, were taken from them; and Louisiana having
a right to make her laws, did thus make them. No other, code
now exists.
By the law then established, the transaction in this case was a contract of sale on condition; and the time for the performance of the
condition is not, by the law, permitted to be extended. After the
time fixed, no redemption can take place. Possession of the property was given when tie sale was made, and has continued from
that time. This is stated in the bill. The possession shows the
character of the arrangement, and proves that no mortgage, but a
sale only, was intended.
The fact that it was a loan of money, and not a sale, is asserted
in the bill; and in the answer this is denied, and it is asserted by
the respondent to have been a sale. No proof to support the allegations in the bill is given, and the facts in the answer are to stand
until disproved. This is the rule in chancery.
But if evidence were required to show that the negotiation was
as represented by the respondent, it will be found in the notes which
were written before it was concluded. Mr. loss asks what sum
Fort and Story will give for the property, to be redeemed by Mr.
Livingston.
The allegation of the increased value of property is not supported
by evidence. The bill filed by the widow of Fort is no part of the
case. But whatever may be the present value of the property, it
can have no influence in the cause.
Suppose the property was now worth one-half of what it was in
.1823, could the respondent apply to the district court of Louisiana,
and :fter making a sale at auction, claim from the legal representafives of Mr. Livingston. the deficiency? This right should be found
in the proceedings in favour of the defendant; or it cannot exist in f&iyour of the representatives of Mr. Livingston.

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

Mr. Clay, also of counsel for the appellee.
This case stands before the Court under no favourable appearances.
A transaction closed in 1823; finally closed; viihout an expression of
dissatisfaction; and in harmony with the written agreements between
the parties: is brought up ten years afterwards, and a claim is made
to put aside all that was then considered completed. Mr. Livingston
was in Louisiana for many years after 1823, in New Orleans; and
no suit was instituted by him to avoid what he had done, and no
complaint made by him. The situation of Mr. Livingston, his profound legal knowledge, and his professional experience, gave him
every opportunity of knowing the import and effect of the instruments executed by the parties. On the other hand, the purchasers
of the property were ignorant of the law, were merchants, not knowing the effect of these instruments. They took them to be what
they imported; and trusted to them upon the plain construction of
their terms.
The first question in the case is, by what law is it to be tried?
The case shows the high and august character of this Court. Accustomed to the rules of the common law, and to the principles and
practice adopted in courts of equity; they are called upon, from a
distant state, to expound laws different from those which their deep
studies have made familiar to them; and a knowledge of which, and
their eminence as jurists, learned in the common law, and the law of
equity, have given them the high positions they hold.
The effect of the decree in this case, when it was formerly before the Court, was no more than to give to the district court of the
eastern district of Louisiana chancery jurisdiction over the cause.
The llan of the constitution of the-United States, was not to create
or apply any laws in the states of the Union in the courts of the
United States, in cases brought before those courts, other than the
established laws of the state; but to give a right to administer those
laws in the cases 16gally brought before those courts. In cases
brought from any state to this Court, thu only power the Court has
is to apply the laws of the state; and in this case the law of Louisiana
will be applied. It is essential to secure confidence in the Court, that
this shall always be done.
In looking at this case, under the laws of Louisiana, the Court
will find that there are no laws which impose penalties on usury;,
and although*the civil code declares the rate of interest in certain

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

cases, and in particular contracts; it does no more. These provisions
will not be filled up by penalties.
It was, in the district court of Louisiana, presented on new pleading, and the facts as exhibited in the defendant's answers, in the contracts 'between the parties, and on the oral evidence, are now, for the
first time, to be considered by this Court.
The question of jurisdiction, from the citizenship of the parties,
was brought before that Court, and the evidente does not show
that the complainant, when the bill was filed, was a citizen of any
other state than Louisiana. This Court will now consider this
question. If, according to the strict rules of pleading, under the
common law, and the practice of courts of chancery, a plea in abatement should have been filed, this is not required by the civil law,
and it will not be now insisted upon. A suggestion of a want of
jurisdiction is always in time; and even if the principles applied in
chancery cases, shall govern in the final decision of this cause, the
practice of the courts of the United States, in Louisiana, are by the
acts of congress, to be conformable to the rules of practice in the
state -courts.
As to the merits of the case, all the allegations of the great value
of the property, are without any evidence to support them. If at
the time of the transaction, the property was of greater value 'than
the sum the defendant and Fort agreed to pay for it, this could have
been, and should have been proved. No testimony was offered on
this subject; and the conclusion is, that such was not the fact. If
afterwards it became of greater value, it did so in consequence of the
improvements made upon it by the purchasers, by the expenditure
of their capital upon it; and by the rise of property in value from
the great prosperity of the city of New Orleans.
But if the value of the estate is to be determined by this Court,
and is essential to the disposition of the case; the Court have evidence
before them, which entirely contradicts all the assertions of the appellant., The accounts rendered by the appellee, show that no proceeds of the property, which will justify or sustain the allegations
of such value, have come into his hands. This is the best testimony
which the case admits of; and the appellant has not attempted to contradict the statements in these accounts.
The liberty of purchasing property, and, the privilege of disposing of it, are among the highest we enjoy. May they not be exer-

[Livingston v. Story.]

cised in the manner which those who acquire or will dispose of property think proper, and on such terms as may be agreed upon?
May not a loan of money on property to-day, be converted into a
sale to-morrow for the money borrowed? Nothing in the laws of
Louisiana to prevent this has been shown; and no such 'provisions
exist. While courts may have looked into transactions of this kind
with a jealous scrutiny, to prevent usury; they have 'not claimed the
powers to make void an absolute sale, made by a person fully competent to act, and who deliberately acted in making the sale; and this
where no evidence has been offered to show that the full value of
'the property sold, was not paid. The whole argument of the appellant assumes that the transaction was that of a loan; and this in direct opposition to the other evidence in the case. It assumes that it
was a loan on the property by Fort and Story; and being s6ch, the
law of Louisiana deprived the borrower of the right to change the
transaction, and make it a sale. To support this position, the law
prevailing in Louisiana has been referred to without success.
Mr. White, in reply, insisted that there was evidence in the case
which fully proved that Alr.. Livingston was, when the bill was
filed, a citizen of the state of New York. He became a citizen of
that state, when he ceased to be a senator from tle state of Louisiana; and his residence in the District of Columbia, while acting as
secretary of state, did not affect, or impair his New York citizenship. He asked, if an exception to the jurisdiction of this Court,
on the allegation that the appellant could not sue in the district court
of the United States of Louisiana, could be admitted; when it did
not appear, that the question of citizenship had been made before
the judge of that court?
As to the operation of the act of limitation, no such point was
made in the court below. If it had been presented, the law of
Louisiana would not have sustained it. Cited, Civil Code, art. 1082,
1084, art. 67, page 436; Title Prescription. In 3 Martin's Rep. 458,
the law on this subject is found. Prescription does not apply
to pledges, and is always interrupted by judicial proceedings; and
it does not run until twenty years. Cited, as to Prescription, or Action of Nullity, Civil Code, 722, 1084.
The argument for the appellant has been mistaken by the counsel
for the defendant., It has not been said that this is the case of a mort-

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

gage. Possession of the property mortgaged, does not expressly, nor
does it ever in Louisiana pass with the execution of the instrument.
This was not then a mortgage. Was it an absolute sale? The demand
of the money at the several succeeding periods when it became payable, and the protests at each period, even at the last, when by the
surrender of the counter-letter, and the new agreement, the transaction had assumed a new aspect; show that it was always considered
and treated as a loan.
The only right Fort and Story acquired by the last agreement, was
the right to procure from a competent court a decree of sale; this
decree they could not legally obtain, until the complainant was
legally put in default, by the sentence of a court.
The complainant was never put in legal default; no legal demand
was made; no sale ordered. The property remains the property of
Livingston in pledge.
The contract was usurious by the law of Louisiana. Interest on
a judicial proceeding is five per cent.; bank interest is six per cent.;
and conventional interest may be ten per cent. No one can recover
on a contract, where the interest exceeds ten per cent. In this case
the contract being usurious, was tainted and corrupted throughout.
The transaction not being one of mortgagc, not being a conditional
sale, or an absolute sale, after the surrender of the counter-letter,
what is it? This is shown in'the laws of Louisiana.
Under ,that law, as under the civil law, the security is one of the
highest order, and one under the peculiar guardianship of the law.
The contract being made, is to be carried out according to its original terms, and no other. If the amount loaned is not repaid, the
lender mut adopt the course which was originally agreed upon; and
which he stipulated to pursue. He can only sell the property by a
judicial sale; and from the sale receive the sum due to him. This is
called an antichresis by the civil code; and all its characteristics and
its incidents are well defined, established,, and declared. Cited, art.
974, 984, Civil Code.
The nature of the antichresis'is, that the lender has the property
in his possession, and receives the profits. These go towards-paying
all expenses to which he may be subjected, and discharging the interest on the loan. The rule of the civil law, both in Louisiana, and
wherever it 1revails, is, once a pledge, always a pledge. Cases have
existed, and the rulesof the law have been applied to them, in which

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.)

as many as one hundred years have elapsed since the transaction
was commenced. 13 Seirey, 223.
The stipulation which was afterwards entered into, that the title
to the pledge should become absolute, and become a title in fee
simple, was void and null by the civil code; and by the decisions of
the courts of Louisiana. Civil Code of 1808, art. 25, tit. Pledge;
Code Napoleon, art. 20, 88. It is here said, the creditor cannot sell
the immovable property pledged, in default of payment, or by the
consent of the contracting party.
The code of Louisiana is borrowed from this article. Under this
article, the French courts have proceeded, and have held that a
creditor cannot sell the pledged article with the consent of the
debtor. 12 Seiiey, 20; 13 Seirey, 233; 7 Seirey, 872. Cited 1
Martin's Rep., New Series, 417; 2 Ibid. 22 , -24,17; 3 Ibid. 17, 168;

The Court will apply the law, which is thus established, to the
case before them. -The appellant asks a restoration of the property
on the restoration of the sum loaned, and the interest, including all
costs and expenses. This is reasonable. It, has been shown that
this may be, and has been done after one hundred years; and in the
case before the Court, little beyond ten years had passed, before the
claim, which is now before the Court, was made. By the decree
which the Court are asked to give, the defendant will sustain no injustice. The appellant, as was said in the argument in chief, does
not place the claim on the law of usury. He asks, that all the interest he agreed to pay, shall be allowed to the defendant; and this
being allowed, and all the capital advanced repaid, the property, is
asked for; or that a sale of the same shall be made, and the residue
of the proceeds paid over, after all that the defendant is entitled to
shall have been fully reimbursed to him.
Mr. Justice WkwE delivered the opinion of the Court
The legal question to be decided in this case, depbnds altogether
upon the facts disclosed in the bill, answers, and documentary evidence on the record.
The complainant charges, that some time previous to the 25th
July, 1822, being in want of money, he applied to the defendant,
and John A. Fort, for a loan, offiering as security, a lot on the batture
of the suburb St. Mary, between Common and Gravier streets, in
New Orleans, on which a building intended for stores, had been

[Livingston v. Story.]

begun; that the defendant and Fort, had agreed to lend him twentytwo thousand nine hundred and thirty-six dollars, of which a part
only, was paid in cash, part in a note of John A. Fort, and eight
thousand dollars of which, was, afterwards, agreed between himself,
the-defendant, and Fort, to be paid by Story and Fort, to one John
Rust, a mechanic; who had coritracted with complainant, to complete
the stores; that to secure the payment of the money borrowed, complainant- conveyed to Fort and Story the lot of ground mentioned;
and that contemporaneously with the deed of sale, they executed on
their part, an instrument in writing, called a counter-letter, by
which they promised, on the payment of twenty-five thousand dollars, on or before the 1st day of February, 1823, to reconvey to the
complainant the property which he had conveyed to them. i The
complainant further charges, that of the sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars, to be paid by him on the 1st of February a part of it was
made up by a charge of interest, at IS per cent. per annum upon the
amount of twenty-two thousand nine hundred and thirty-six dollars)
actually advanced to him, and on his account to Rust, by Fort and
Story. The complainant also' transferred his written contract with
Rust, to the defendant and Fort, rendering himself responsible for
the proper employment of the eight thousand dollars by Rust, and
which was to be paid Rust in weekly payments, by the defendant'
and Fort. Rust, on his part, consented to the transfer of his contract,
and accdpts Fort and Story in the place of complainant. The stores
were to be completed by Rust, by the first of November, 1822, in a
workmanlike manner, and all the materials, except those already provided, were to be found by Rust; and -in his contract, he renounces
all claim or prix.lege upon the building, beyond the eight thousand
dollars which was to be paid him by Fort and Story, for the complainant. For the deed of sale from Livingston to Fort and Storythe counter-letter to Livingston-Rust's contract, and the transfer of
it-all of the same date, see documents, A B, C, ante, page 354. The
complainant further charges, that soon after the transaction, he left
New Orleans, and that when he returned to it, he found that Fort
and Story had paid to Rust eight thousand dollars on his account;
but that little or nothing had been done towards the completion of
the stores; so that if the property had been sold on the 1st of February, according to the terms of the-counter-letter, it would not have
produced any thing like its full value. That under these circumstances, he applied to Fort and Story for further time to make the

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

payment of the sum loaned, which they would not consent to, but
on the following onditions: that the property should be advertised
for sale on the 2d of June, 1823; that the sum due them should be
increased from twenty-five thousand dollars to twenty-seven thousand five hundred- dollars; which was so increased, by the addiiohi
of fifteen hundred dollars as interest, at eighteen per cent for four
months, eight hundred dollars for auctioneers' commissiohs, fifty

dollars for advertising, and one hundred and fifty dollars, arbitrarily
.added by the said Fort and Story. The complainant states, that
being entirely at the mercy of Fort and Story, he consented to those
terms, and executed a paper accordingly; ante, page 356. On the
2d June, the complainant being still unable to repay the actual sum
advanced to him, and the additions made by the charge of interest
at eighteen per cent. &c. &c., he applied to Fort and Story for a further extension of the time of sale, which they consented to for two
months longer, to the 5th of August, by which his debt to them was
augmented to twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and thirty dol-

lars seventy-six cents; he agreeing in writing, that if, on the last
mentioned day, he should fail to pay twenty-seven thousand eight
hundred dollars, seventy-six cents, then the lot and all the buildings
thereon were to becbime the full and absolute property of Fort and
Story; ante, page 356. The day came, and the complainant did not
pay. The defendant had him protested, as he had before done on
the 4th of February, for his noncompliance with .his agreement to
pay the sum of twenty-frye thousand dollars: and on that of the 5th
of August, for his noncompliance with his agreement to pay twentyseven thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars, seventy-six cents;
and for all damages, costs and charges, and interest, suffered or to
be suffered by the said Fort and Story. The defendant and Fort
after this, continued in possession of the lot and buildings, until the
death of Fort, which took place in 1828; and after th& death of Fort,
the defendant Story retained or tdok possession of the property by
an arrangement with the heirs of Fort. It is to be remembered that'
the possession of the property wag given by Livingston to Fort and
Story, on the 22d of July, 1822, when the deed of sale and counter-,
letter were executed.
Here it is proper, for a full understanding of the transaction between these parties, to set out, what were the rights of Livingston,
and obligations of Fort and Story to Livingston, growing out of the "
counter-letter,'and continued by them on the subsequent agrdement,

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

until that of the 2d of June; when it was stipulated by Livingston,
that if he failed to pay on the 5th of August, the property was to
become absolute in them.
The counter-letter, after reciting that Livingston had sold and
conveyed to them the lot, buildings and improvements, for the sum
of twenty-five thousand dollars in cash, declares it to be the true
intent and meaning of the parties to said deed of sale, that if Livingston shall pay and reimburse to Fort and Story, twenty-five thousand
dollars, or, or before the 1st of February, 1823, then Fort and Story
stipulate and bind themselves to reconvey the property to Livingston. And in case of nonpayment, at the stipulated time, then Fort
and Story "covenant and agree to cause the said property to be
sold at public auction, by one of the licensed auctioneersof this
city, after twenty days' public notice, on the following terms, to
wit, twenty-five thousand dollars in cash, and the residue in
equalpayments, at one and two years; the purchasersgiving satisfactory endorsed notes, and special mortgage on the property
until final payment. The residue, after deducting the costs attending the sale, to be delivered over to the said Edward Livingston.
When the first extension of the time of payment was given, we
find, substantially, the clause of the kind just recited. It will be
Well to give it in terms.
Agreement between Edward Livingston and John A. Fort and
Benjamin Story:
1st. The sale of lot No. 1,. on the batture, with the buildings
thereon, to be postponed until the 2d of June next
2d. On that day it shall be sold by M'Coy & Co., unless sooner
redeemed, after being advertised in the Courier de la Louisiane, in
,French, and the Orleans Gazette, in English, from the 1st day of
May previous to sale.
3d. The conditions of the sale shall be 27,350 dollars cash, and
the residue at one and two years, with special mortgage: but in
this sum is included 850 dollars, at which the auctioneers' commission and charges of advertisement are calculated,which are
to be deducted or reduced to what they shallreally amount to, if
payment be made before the 1st of June.
4th. The overplus, after dedueting the cash payment, is to be
delivered to Edward Livingston.
5th. The counter-letter, executed by Messrs. Fort and Story,

JANUARY- TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

shall be delivered up, and the registry thereof annulled immediately after the signature of this agreement, made by duplicate, &c.
The defendant begins his answer by denying the right of the
complainant to sue in the district court of the United States for
the eastern district of Louisiana, on account of both being citizens
of the same state; equivalent to a denial of the jurisdiction of the
court over the case.
He then denies, positively and repeatedly, that Fort and himself,
either jointly or separately, ever agreed to lend the complainant
22,936 dollars. So far from any loan having been intended by the
parties, he says, the negotiation for the sale of the lots began between
Fort and Nathan Morse, (the latter of whom he states as having
acted for the complainant;) and that one of them informed himthat
the complainant wished to raise money on mortgage; that he peremptorily refused to advance any money to the complainant on
mortgage. That this refusal was afterwards made by him to the defendant himself; and for a confirmation ofhis refusal and understanding of the parties, he refers to two notes of Morse, as a part
of his answer, both of them addressed to Fort; the first dated the
13th of July, and the other on the day the conveyance of the lot
was made to himself and Fort, by Livingston. Ante, page 360.
He then state the sale of the lot to himself and Fort; refers io
the deed of sale; and, generally, declares himself a1id Fort have
paid more than the price agreed on for the property so purchased.
'He then admits the execution, by himself -and Fort, on the day oa
the sale, of an instrument in writing giving to Livingstbn the poweto redeem; whereby, upon the payment of 25,000 dollars, on or before the 1st of February, they were to reconvey the property to
Livingston; and if he fail-d t6 pay, that Fort and Story were to
sell the property so acquired and purchased, and if it brought more
than 25,000 dollars, that they would give the surplus to the comiplainant. The answer then contains the failure of Livingston to
pay; the extension of time to him by another agreement, to the 2d
of June, on which they agreed to postpone the sale; and that Livingston was to give them a compensation for the additional chance which
the tinie allowed gave him to repurchase the lot. Upon this agreement the defendant relies to prove an absolute bill of sale of th,,property to himself and Fort at the time of its execution; because
the fifth and last clause of it annulled the counter-letter. The defendant recites the second failure of Livingston-lo pay; the fur-

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

ther extension of time to him to the 5th of August, and Livingston's stipulation, ante, page 356, by which, on Livingston's failure to
pay 27,830 dollars 76 cents, and any further sum that Fort and Story
may be uider the necessity of paying for the care and preservation
of the property; the lot and buildings were to become the full and
absolute property" of Fort and Story; and Livingston's obligation to
surrenderand cancel all and every writing or other document in
relation to the property, that may give him any equity of redemption, or other rightin the premises; it being the true intent
and meaning of the parties,that in case of failure of payment,
that the lot and buildings,and appurtenances,are to vest in Fort
and Story a full title in fee simple, forever. The defendant insists that Livingston was the guarantee of Rust, for the application
of the 8000 dollars to the completion of the buildings. He then
relies upon the ninety-third and ninety-fourth articles of "the Civil
Code of Louisiana, then in force in the state; to give himself and
Fort an absolute and irrevocable title to the property, on Livingston's failure to pay on the 5th of August. The articles relied on
are: "The time fixed for redemption must be rigorously adhered to,
it cannot be prolonged by the judge;" and "if that right has not
been exercised within the time agreed on by the vendor, he cannot
exercise it afterwards; and the purchaser becomes irrevocably possessor of the thing sold."
He reiterates his denial of any loan, or
that time was given to Livingston to repay a loan: but that the extension of time was to enable Livingston to repurchase, or to effect
the sale of the property; and, that the increase of the sum from
25,000 dollars to 27,830 dollars 76 ,cents, was the sum demanded by
them as the consideration of their waiver of their right to have the
sale made at the time the money was payable. The defendant denies the deduction of interest at eighteen per cent. per annum, or
any other.
To the second interrogatory in the&bill, he answers, tfiat, at the
time of the purchase, he paid Lifvingston in a check on the United
States Bank, twelve thousand hnd six dollars fifty-seven cents, in a
note of John A. Fort, in favour of defendant, due and paid November
25th; 1822, two thousand seven hundred and sixty-four dollars
eighty-three cents; and to Nathan Morse, Esquire, the attorney of
,Edward Livingston, one thousandAollars; which sum, Morse stated
to Story, he considered ought to have been paid him by Livingston,for effecting a sale of the property. To the fourth interroga-

tory; which is, if Fort and Story did not consent to postpone the
sale of the property to the second of June, and did not exact, as a
condition of such postponement, that the counter-letter should be
cancelled, and that the complainant should pay -the sum of two thousand ,five hundred dollars, in addition to the twenty-five thousand
dollars: and whether the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars
was not made up of interest, charged for four months, at 18 per
cent. per annum, of eight hundred dollars auctioneers' commission,
fifty dollars for advertising, and an arbitrary sum of one hundred and
fifty dollars, the defendant answers, that Fort and himself did consent to postpone the sale: but that he does not know, except from
the act, how the additional sum stipulated to be paid by them was
composed; nor does he recollect any memorandum containing the
-items of the additional sum.
In an exhibit by the defendant, we, however, have a more precise statement of the sum paid to Livingston.

Thus, substantially confirming the allegation of the complainant,
that the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars expressed on the deed
of sale, as the consideration for the purchase, was made up in part of
an amount of interest upon that sum, deducted by Fort and Story,
contemporaneously with the execirtion of the deed of sale, and
counter-letter. There is this difference too between the answer of
the defendant and the exhibit, that it appears, from the latter, the
sum of one thousand dollars paid to Morse, which the defendant, in
his answer, alleges to have been paid by him as a part of the consideration for the lot, or on account of Livingston; was not paid to
Morse until the 12th of February, 1824; more than six months after
the time when the defendant considered himself and Fort, to have
acquired a full and absolute title to the property, from the failure of
Livingston to pay on the 5th of August preceding. Upon this item
of money paid to Morse, we remark, that the letters of Morse, ante,
page 360, do not prove Morse to have been the agent of Livingston
in negotiating the transaction between the parties; but rattier that he
was, if not altogether the agent of Fort and Story, the agent of both

-SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

the parties: and that the defendant, without consulting Livingston,
graduated the compensation of Morse by his own ideas of the service
rendered by him; and chose to pay Morse one thousand dollars,
after he considered Livingston had forfeited his right to redeem the
property. The answer and exhibit are contradictory upon -this
point; but the latter being more detailed and certain, it forces, the
conclusion to which we have come as regards that item. We must
remark, too, that the answer and exhibit are also contradictory in
a more essential particular, as regards the interest alleged to have
been deducted from the twenty-five thousand dollars;at the time the
deed of sale was executed; the exhibit stating the fact of interest
being then deducted, and the answer denying that 18 per cent. interest was deducted,or any other.
Soon after the transaction of the 25th of July, 1822, the complainant left New Orleans, and did not return to it until after the
time within which Rust was to have had the buildings completed.
They were not finished, however; and this incidefit deserves a passing notice. The defendant and Fort had required- an assignment
of Rust's contract to them; indeed it is of the same date with the
deed of sale and counter-letter, and seems to hay. been made by
Livingston and Rust for them. It was transferred with Rust's
consent, they undertaking to make weekly payments to him of 666
dollars during the progress of the work, to the amount of 8000 dollars; and Livingston rendering himself responsible for the proper
employment of the money by Rust. In a short time, however, the
defendant admits that he discovered Rust misapplying the money to
some other contract; and that, upon remonstrating with him against
such conduct, Rust persisted in a declaration of his intention to expend the money otherwise than in the execution of his contract.
Under these circumstances, what should the defendant and Fort have
done? We think, good fAith with Livingston, as they had mde
themselves his agent to disburse 8000 dollars for a particular object,
to which'they had become parties by the transfer of the contract,
required from them in Livingston's absence, to have stopped further
payments to Rust, notwithstanding Livingston's responsibility for
the proper employment oT the money: for Rust's obligation to them
under the transferred contract, was to have the stores finished by
the 1st of November; and as they held the funds to ble applied to
that object, they should have withheld them from Rust, when he
declared his intention not to do so, and had ceased to work upon the

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

buildings. Rust's conduct was as much a breach of his contract with
them as it was with Livingston; and they should have piotected
themselves and Livingston, which they could easily have done. histead of this being done, the defendant admits he continued the
weekly payments to Rust after he- had discovered the misapplication
of the money; ,and that but one thousand dollars of the eight thousand dollars were applied to the buildings., They neither protected
themselves, nor Livingston: and it cannot be disguised that the misapplication of the money was much more fatal to Livingston than
themselves; for the buildings being unfinished in November, Livingston was deprived of any further resources from them to aid him in
redeeming the property on the 1st of February, by paying the money
advanced by them. This incident gave Livingston a strong claim
upon the defendant for an extension of time; and we cannot but remark, that it has a bearing in favour of the allegation of the complainant, that by the contract of Jdly, 1825, an absolute sale Was not
intended. Is it reasonable to suppose that the defendant and Fort,
if an absolute sale had been intended, would have calmly seen the
misapplication of eight thousand dollars from -whatthey-deem their
property, and taken Livingston as a security, upon his general responsibility for Rust; when the defendant himself declares he would
not have loaned Livingston money on any account? The consequence of this misapplication of seven thousand dollars by Rust,
was to take so much from Livingston's ability to redeem the property. The complainant, however, does not pray to be discharged
from this sum, on a settlement of the transaction with the defendant;
and, therefore, the payment to Rust, of eight thousand dollars, must
be allowed to be a charge against Livingston.
We do not deem it necessary to make a further synopsis of the
bill and answer.
. They are contradictory in several points: but a careful examination of them, and of the, documents and exhibits attached to the
answer, has enabled us to fix the legal character of the transaction,
throughout, under the laws of Louisiana; whatever, may have been
the designs of the parties'upon each other, or their individual intentions, when the contract was made, on the 25th of July, 1822.
The law of Louisiana controls the controversy between these parties: and the first, indeed, only question, to-be determined, is, what
was the legal character of the contract between them, from the execution of the first papers to the last, on the 2d of June, 1823?

The defendant's counsel do not contend that it was an absolute sale. The -defendant's apswer shows it was not. He admits
Livingston's power to redeem, and their obligation to reconvey, as
expressed in the counter-letter. For although the conveyance of
the 25th of July, 1822, is, in form, a positive sale, yet, the counterletter explains its nature as fully as if it were inserted in that conveyance. Executed, as it was at the same ti'me, it is a part of the
contract; a separate clause, modifying and explaining the other
clause, states the deed of sale. The two must be construed together.
The Civil Code of Louisiana says, 4 all clauses of agreements are
interpreted 'the one by the other, giving to each the sense which
results from the entire act;" Civil Code, 1808, p. 270, see. 5, art 61.
It can make no difference whether these clauses be on one piece
of paper, or on two pieces; whether there be two separate instruments, or one instrument containing the substance of the two. The
Civil Code of Louisiana does not require that the stipulation of parties, relative to a sale of property, should be in one instrument.
They are to be reduced to writing, and the Darts necessarily make
up the entire contract; in this regard, corresponding with the sale
in equity, which makes a defeasance attach itself to a conveyance,
absolute in the first instance, converting the latter into a mortgage,
as it is expressed by chancellor Kent, in Com. 4 Vol. p. 135, treating of mortgages. "The condition upon which the land is conveyed is usually inserted in the deed of conveyance, but the de,
feasance may be contained in a separate instrument; and if the deed
be absolute in the first instance, and the defeasance be executed
subsequently, it will relate back to the date-of the principal deed, and
connect itself with it, so as to render it a security, in the nature of a
mortgage."
We do not mean to be understood as applying this rule to make,
under the laws of Louisiana, a constructive mortgage out of an absolute conveyance or deed of sale, on account of some other papei explaining or controlling the first; but have used it only as an illustration, that by the law of Louisiana, a contract of sale, and a power
redeem, need not be in one instrument.
The contract of the 25th of July, 1822, not being an absolute sale
then, what is it? It is either a conditional sale, vente a r6m~r6, (sale
with the right of redemption,) a mortgage, or a pledge. Thb defendant's counsel say it is the first, a conditional sale, vente a r6m6r6.
We will use their language. They say it is a contract of sale, not a

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.)

pure and simple sale, but a sale with conditions, and i right or power
of redemption annexed, vente a r6m6r6; that the right and power of
redemption stipulated for in this case, is in exact conformity with
the provisions of the same code of 1808, in form and substance, and
identifies it still further as a sale, vente a r~m~r6. That is defined
to be "an agreement or paction, by which the vendor reserves to
himself the power of taking back the thing sold, by returning the
price paid for it;" Civil Code, 245; 'and the provision of the code
regulating the right of redemption, or that " the time fixed for redemption must be rigorously adhered to, it cannot be prolonged by
the judge;" and "if that right has not been exercised within the time
agreed on by the vendor, he cannot exercise it afterwards, and the
purchaserbecomes irrevocablypossessed of the thing sold;" just as
at common law and in equity, in the case of an absolute sale with
an agreement for a repurchasp, the time limited for the repurchase
must be precisely observed, or the vendor's right to reclaim his property will be lost. 1 Poth. on Sale, 183; 1 Vesey, 405.
But in this instance there was no sale corresponding to the vente
a r~m6r6, unless other provisions in the counter-letter than Livingston's right to redeem, shall be altogether disregarded. By the
counter-letter, Fort and Story covenant with Livingston upon his
failure to pay, that the property shall be sold at auction, and that
the residue of what it might bring over the sum which they claimed,
should be paid to Livingston. Upon failure to p&y, the land and
buildings did not become the property of Fort and Story. The
failure to pay only gave to them the right to have it sold; according
to the terms prescribed, for theiL own reimbursement. Had the
contract been a vente a r~m6r6, the land would have become their
absolute property; for the code is, "if the right to redeem has not
been exercised within the time agreed on by the vendor, he cannot
.exercise it afterwards, and the purchaser becomes irrevocably possessed of the thing sold."
The exclusion of- that irrevocablA possession by Fort and Story
in the counter-letter, upon Livingston's failure to pay, destroys so
principal and effective a provision of the vente a r6m~r6, that *the
law will not permit us to consider the contract to have been one bf
that kind.
The question then recurs, what was the nature of the contract of
the 25th July, 1822? It is not a mortgage, because no property on
the soil, nor right of possession, is given by the contract of mort-

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

gage by the lam of Louisiana. By that law, a mortgage is defined
to be "a contract, by which a person affects the whole of his property, or only some part of it, in favour of another, for security of
an engagement; but without divesting himself of the possession
thereof." In this instance possession accompanied the execution of
the deed, and has continued in the 'defendant. It was a part of the
contract, and a feature of it entirely inconsis~nt with a mortgage
under the laws of Louisiana. The contract thet, being neither a sale
upon condition with a power to redeem annexed, a vente a r6m6r6;
we must seek further in the laws of Louisiana, to establish its
legal character. After much inquiry and deliberation, and a comparison of the Civil Code of Louisiana with the civil law from which
the former derives its origin, and with which it is still in close connection; we have come to the conclusion, that the original contract
and counter-letter constituted a pledge of real property; a kind of
contract, especially provided for by the laws of Louisiana, denominated "an antichresis." By this kind of contract, the possession of
the property is transferred to the person advancing the money.
That was done in this case. In case of failure to pay, the property
is to be sold by judicial sentence; and the sum which it may bring
over the amount for which it was pledged, is to be paid to the person nmaking the pledge. In this case, a provision was made 'for a
sale by the parties upon the failure of payment; but this feature of.
the contract is rather confirmatory of the contract and counter-letter,
being an antichresis, than otherwise; for it is, at most, only a substitution by the parties of what the laws of Louisiana requires; and
what we think the law requires to be done by itself, through the
functionaries who are appointed to administer the law. But upon
this point, let the"1av spea for itself. The Civil Code of Louisiana
says, "the pledge is a contract, -by which the debtor gives something
to his creditor as a security for-his debt." Tit. 20, art. 3100,
' . There are two kinds of pledges; the pawn, and antichresis."
"A. thing is said to be pawned, when a movable thing is given as
security. • The antidresis is, when the security given consists in immovables." Tit. 20, art. 3102.
' The antichresis shall be reduced to writing. The creditor acquires by this contract, the right of reaping the fruits or other revenues of the immovables to him given in pledge, on condition *of
deducting annually their pyocceds from the interest, if any be due
to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt." Art. 3143.

TANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

"The creditor ig bound, unless the contrary is agreed on, to pay the
taxes as well as the annual charges of the property given to him in
pledge. He is likewise bound under the penalty of damages to provide for the keeping, and useful, and necessary repairs of the pledged
estate, and maylevy out of the revenues of the estate sufficient for
such expense." Art. 3144.
"The creditor does not become proprietor of the pled ged immovables by failure of the payment at the stated time: any clause to the
contrary is null: and in this case it is only lawful for him to sue
his debtor before the court, in order to obtain a sentence against
him, and to cause the objects which have been put in his hands to
ibe sezed and sold." Art. 3146.
"The debtor cannot, before the full payment of the debt, claim the
enjoyment of the immovables which he has given in pledge. But
the creditor, who wishes to free himself from the obligations mentioned in the preceding articles, may always, unless he has renounced
this right, compelthe debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables. Art. 3145. These appear to us to be equitable provisions, affording ample security to the creditor, and fully protecting the-rights
of the debtor. Especially protecting the latter from a rapacious creditor, who might otherwise push his debtor's necessities into a relinquishmhent of all his rights in such a contractLto make himself the
proprietor of the thing pledged, upon the failure of the debtor to
pay. This is a high species of security, over which the law watches
benignantly; because., though one of choice and convenience, very
frequently; it is commonly the resort of distress in the last alternative, when all other means of raising money have failed.

It was

this high species of security, that Fort and Story received from
Livingston; or their contract cannot be-comprehended within any of
the provisions of the Civil Code of Louisiana. If any thing else, it is
a'contract unknown to the laws of that state. We class it with the
antichresis: not because the instrument between the parties provides specifically in every particular for the rights and obligations of
parties to the antichresis; but because it does so, in the main and substantial requisites of such a contract, and from those main and sub.,
stantial particulars in this contratt, being irreducible to any other
kind of contract provided for by the laws of Louisiana. The property was put into the possession of Fort and Story; they looked to
it to reimburse them upon the failure of 'Livingston to pay; -upon
that failure it did not, from the terms of thd counter-letter, become

SUPREME COURT
[Livingston'v. Story.]

theirs absolutely; as we see would have been the case if it had-been
a vente a r6m6r6. It was to be sold at public auction; and if a sale
should be made for more than they had advanced, the residue was
to be paid to Livingston. But no such sale could be made without
a judicial sentence; such a decree was not obtained; no sale was
made; so .the parties stood under the contract on the 1st of February,
when Livingston first failed to pay, as ihey did when it was first
entered into. It is therefore plain, that Fort and'Story acquired no
absolute property in the lot and buildings, under the contract of the
25th of July, 1822; and if they did not, it was only a pledge or antichresis for their ultimate reimbursement..
We now proceed to inquire whether the antichresis was converted
into a sale, by the annulment of the counter-letter after the 1st of
February, 1823, under the agreement of the 4th of March. It appears by the-document, ante, page 356, that the complainant did, on
the last mentioned day, execute a paper annulling the counter-letter
of the 25th July. But supposing the first to have been so annulled;
was not the second in effect and in terms,.another instrument of the
same kind, only extending the time for redemption upon consideration of Livingston's paying a larger sum than. the twenty-five
thousand dollars originally expressed in the first deed of sale; and
providing still for a sale in the event of Livingston failing to jay a
second time, and giving to him the residue, if any should remain,
after they were reimbursed. Consequently, until the 2d of June, the
pledge continued. Livingston, under the agreement of the 4th March,
could, by paying the money at any time on or before the 2d of June,
have prevented the sale; and if a sale was made, he was entitled to
the overplus.
The defendant, in his answer, says, that he and Fort agreed with
Livingston to postpone the sale until the 2d of June, for which
Livingston agreed to pay them. a compensation, &c. &c.; that he
had until the 2d of June to redeem, but did not do so; that then the
property was to have been sold, &c. &c. Thus showing, that the
property in his possession continued to be a pledge; and in case of
Livingston's not paying, that a sale was to be made, notwithstanding
the annulment of the counter-letter. But for what purpose was the
counter-letter annulled? Clearly, because an increased sum was to be
paid to Fort and Story by the second agreement; and not because it
was the intention of the parties to alter, substantially, their respective
rights in the property. The counter-letter, the agreement to sell at

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

391

[Livingston v. Story.]

a fixed day, and after reimbursing the defendant and Fort, to deliver
the surplus proceeds of the sale to Livingston; thc prolbagen agreement to sell after annulling the first counter-letter, withpt any renunciation of Livingston's right to the overplus, as set forth in defendant's answer; prove conclusively, to us, that Story regarded the
contract to be, what is really made by the law of Louisiana, a con.tract of pledge; a security for money advanced upon property. We
think it was in its inception an antichresis; and that it continued so
until the 2d of June, 1823. Did it after that time retain its original
character?
The agreement of the 2d of June recites, " that it being the day
fixed upon by the contract between Livingston, and Fort and Story,
for the sale t auction of the lot, &c. &c.; and Livingston having
requested that the sale might not take place for his own accorijmodation; on condition that Fort and Story would assent to that request,
Livingston agreed to increase the sum due to them to twenty-seven
thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars, (which they deem the
whole of the consideration money paid by them for said lot,) and to
pay the saiie on the 5th of August, then- next, and any further sum
that they may be under the necessity of paying for the care or preservation of the property; in" which case the property should revert
to Livingston. But if he should fail to make such payment on the
5th of August, the said lot shoild become the absolute property of
Fort and Story; it being declared to be the true intent of ihe parties,
in case of failure of payment, that the said lot, with all the buildings
thereon, are to vest in Fort and Story, a full, free and absolute.title,
in fee simple, for ever."
Such an instrument as this would have the effect to vest in Fort
and Story an absolute title in the pronerty, if it were not positively
controlled by the law of Louisiana. We must administer the law as
it is; and having established that the original transaction was an antichresis, and cofitinued so up to the 2d ot 'June, it was not in the
power of the parties to give to it such a character, as to vest oy the
act of Livingston an absolute title-in Fort and1 Story. " In the language
of the Code, 1808, tit. Pledge, art. 28, already cited, the creditor does
not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by failure of
payment at the stated time, any clause to tIe .contrary is .nul:"
"and in this case it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor, before
the court, in order to obtain a sentence against him, and to cause the
objects which have been put laro lUG hands, in pledge, to be seized

SUPREME -COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

and sold." If such a clause had been inserted in the original agreement, it would have been void. Can it be more valid, because subsequently introduced in a paper having a direct relation to the first
contract; and which was intended to alter its character into something which the law prohibits, when it determines the original contract to be one of pledge? We think not. Such an allowance to a
creditor would be a precedent, giving to all creditors in cases of
pledges the power to defeat the benevolent vigilance of the law, preventing them from becoming proprietors of the debtor's property,
unless by a decree of the court. We think it immaterial whether
such covenant be in the'original agreement, or in a subsequent instrument. In either case the law is express; the creditor does not
become the proprietor by the failure of the debtor to pay; any clause
to the contrary is null.
It would be difficult to find a case more clc rly illustrating the
wisdom of this rule, than that under our conside:ation. Story and
Fort advanced to Livingston twenty-two thousand nine hundred andi
thirty-six dollars, and took possession of the lot; looking to Livingston, in the first instance, for reimbursement, and, on his failure to
pay, to a sale of the lot. Livingston being unable to pay at the time
fixed, applied for an extension of time; it is granted, but only upon
condition of an addition of twenty-five hundred dollars to his debt,
for a delay of four months: thus creating a debt of twenty-seven
thousand five hundred dollars, in ten months, upon an advance of
twenty-two thousand seven hundred and seventy-one dollars. forty
cents. This increase, the exhibit attached to the defendart's answer proves was not on account of expenditures upon, or in 'the
care of the property; for that account shows the disbursements of
the defendant, in the care of the property, up to the 5th of August,
1823, did not amount to four hundred dollars. When the 2d of June
came, Livingston was still unable to pay, and asked for a further extension of time; it was granted; but by another addition to the debt,
or to the amount for which the property was already encumbered;
-ind only upon condition that upon a third failure, the property was
tL vest absolute in Fort and Story. This final result is what the law
of Louisiana intended to prevent in cases of pledge; and we know
not a case to which it can be more fairly applied.
In the enforcement ot the law, in this case, we are pleased to find
authorities for doing so in the courts of Louisiana. We refer to the
'cases of Williams et al. v. Schooner St. Stephens, 1 Mart. Rep. N. S.

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

393

[Livin~gton v. Story.]

417; to the case of Syndics of Bermudez v. Hanez & Milne, 3 Mart.
Rep. 17, and 168.
In regard to the plea of prescription urged in the defendant's
answer, we think it inapplicabli to a case of pledge; and if it be so,
then that plea cannot prevail in this case, because the time had not
elapsed, which the law of Louisiana gives to a person to sue for immovable property.
It now only remains for us to dispose of the defendant's protest,
in the beginning of his answer, against the jurisdiction of the Court
in this case. The 23d rule of this Court, for the regulation of equity
practice in the circuit courts, has been relied on to show that it is
competent for the defendant, instead of filing a formal demurrer, or
plea, to insist on any special matter in his answer; and have the
same benefit thereof as if he had pleaded the same matter, or hiad demurred to the bill. This rule is understoQd by us to apply to matters applicable to the merits, and not to mere pleas to the jurisdiction, and especially to those founided on any personal disability,
or person,-l character of the party suing, or to any pleas merely in
abatement. In this respect, it is merely affirmative of the general
rule of the court of chancery; in which matters in abatement and to
the jurisdiction, being preliminary in their nature, must be taken advantage of by plea; and cannot be taken advantage of in a general
answer, which necessarily admits the right and capacity of the party
to sue. 1 Sumner's Rep. 506, Wood v. Mann.
In this case, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and a
decree will be entered accordingly.
Mr.Justice BA DWIN, dissenting.
When this case was before the Court at a former term, I dissented.
from the judgment then rendered, being of opinion that the case
ought to be decided by the law of Louisiana, not the code of equity
adopted from the" English system into the jurisprudence of the
United States, as the Court then decided.
As the civil law was admitted to have been in force in that province, before its cession to the United States, and remained afterwards the basis of the jurisprudence of the state, with only such
modifications as were made by their local laws; I felt itto be the
duty of this Court to administer it as it does the law of other states,
"precisely as the state courts should do." 2 Pet. 656; 5 Pet. 400. It

tion between the law and equity jurisdiction of its courts, either in
the principles, or mode of proceeding; the process and rules of judgment are the same, without regard to the nature of the right asserted,
or the remedy sought. This contradistinction exists only in the jurisprudence of England, and the states which have adopted it; nor can it
exist elsewhere, unless the common law prevails. The jurisdiction of
courts of equity, separately from those of common law, is a necessary
part of the common law; though the forms of proceeding are borrdwed from the civil law, yet the principles and rules of decision are those
of the law of England, by which the judge is as much bound as in a
court of law. By the adoption of its forms, an English court of chancery no more adopts the civil law, as a code or system of jurisprudence, superseding the common law, than it does the decrees of the
emperor in place of acts of parliament. Both systems remain as
distinct, as if the modes of proceeding differed as much as the two
systems; and though.the civil law forms are better adapted to equity
proceedings than those of the common law, there is another incompatibility between the two systems. The separation of cases in law
from those in equity, is a necessary incident of the common law;
one part of the system cannot be engrafted on the civil law without
the other: of consequence the introduction of the equity part of the
common law into a state which has adopted the civil law, necessarily
displaces it; and introduces a, system of jurisprudence wholly at
variance therewith.
This conclusion is the result of the opinion and reasoning of the
Court, which is applied to all civil causes in the courts of the United
States, in that state: 9 Pet. 656, 7: for if the English system of
equity is in force, because there is no court of equity; the whole
common law is also in force, because there is no court of law, contradistinguished from equity; on this ground alone, my objections
t the former decision were insuperable. By the third article of the
Louisiana treaty, the inhabitants are guarantied " in the free enjoyment ot iajir liberty, property, and the religion which they profess."
1 Laws U. '2 36. "That the perfect inviolability and security of
property is amo g these rights, all will assert and maintain. 9 Pet.

till altered by the new sovereign." 9 Pet. 747. This principle was
recognised by congres' by the I1th section of the act of 1804, organizing the government of Louisiana; the 4th section of the act
of 2d March; and the 9th section of the act of 3d March, 1805.
"The laws in force in the said territory, at the commencement of this
act, and not inconsistent with the provisions thereof, shall continue
in force until altered, modified, or repealed by the legislature." 2
Story, 937, 964, 973. Congress extended none of the provisions of
the judiciary or process acts to Louisiana; and iuistead of reserving to
themselves the power of altering the local laws hy those acts,
expressly declared that power to be in the local legislature. These
were solemn pledges, which the legislative power of the United
States had never attempted to violate; or in my opinion could violate, witnout disregarding the faith of the treaty: to my mind a
guaranty of property is inconsistent with the abrogation of the laws
under which property is acquired, held and regulated, and the consequent substitutioh of a code, to which the people were utter strangeru. Satisfied that if there could be a power to change the laws of
a ceded country, it was in the legislative, and not the judicial department of the government; I considered these provisions of the
acts of congress to be as imperative on this Court, as any other laws
were, or could be.
A reference to the terms of the-process act of 1792, will show
that it could not apply to a state idf which the civil law prevailed;
-for it directs the modes of proceeding "in suits at common law,"
and "in those of equity, and maritime, and admiralty jurisdiction,
according to the rules" &c. which belong to courts of equity, and to
courts of admiralty, as contradistinguished from courts of common
law; 1 Story, 258. These terms necessarily exclude its application
to a system, in which there was no such contradistinction; but in
the act of 1824, the term is peculiarly appropriate -to the law of
Louisiana. "That the mode of proceeding in all civil causes, &c.'" 3
Story, 1971. The reason was obvious; there was but one mode of
suing, whatever may be the cause of action. Congress thus declared,
that the laws of the state regulating the practice of their-courts, shall
be the rule in the courts of the United States therein; so it had been
for twenty years, and the state practice was confirmed, subject to
such rules as the district judge might make. So it was construed and
declared by this Court in 1830. "If no such rule had been adopted,
the act of congress made the practice of the state the rule for the

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

Court of the United States. Unless then, such a special rule existed,
the Court was bound to follow the general enactment of congress on
the subject, and pursue the state practice." 3 Pet. 445. Parsons v.
Bedford, 3 Pe . 424, S. P; Parsons v. Armor et al. In Duncan v. The
United States, the Court, after reciting the act of 1824, are still more
expliciL "This section was a virtual repeal within the state of Louisiana, of all previous acts of congress which regulated the practice
of the courts of the United States, and which come within its province. It adopted the practice of the state courts of Louisiana, subject to such alterations a the district judge might deem necessary
to conform to the organization of the district court, aid avoid any
discrepancy with the laws of the Union." 7 Pet. 450. "As the act
of 1824 adopted the practice of the state courts; before this Court
could sanction a disregard of such practice '± must appear that by
an exercise of the power of the district court, or by some other
means, the practice had been altered. On a question of practice
under the circumstances of the case, it would seem that the decision
of the district court as above made, should.be conclusive. How
can the practice of the Court be better known or established, than by
its own solemn adjudication on the subject?" Ib. 451, 2.
The act of 1828, is still more conclusive, when taken in connection with the decision of this Court on the process act of 1792.
"In order to understand the bearing which the instructi6n moved
for, has upon the cause, it is necessary to remark, that the state of
Ohio was not admitted into the Union till 1802; so that the process
act, of 1792, which is expressly confined in its operation to the day
of, its passage, in adopting the practice of the state courts into the
courts of the United States, could have no operation in that state.
But the district court of the United States, established in the state in
1803, was vested with all the powers and jurisdiction of the district
court of Kentucky, which exercised full circuit court jurisdiction,
with power to create a practice for its own government." 1 Pet. 612.
This decision was made in 1828; and the same view was taken
five years afterwards, in Duncan v. The United States. " Nor did the
act (of 1792) apply to those states which were subsequently admitted
into the Union. But this defect was removed by the act of the 19th
of May, 1828, which placed all the courts of the United State; on a
footing in this respect, except such as are held Jn the state of
Louisiana." 7 Pet. 451.
This act uses the same terms as the process act of 1792, in referring

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

397

[Livingston v. Story.]

to cases in law, equity, and admiralty; and so would not be applicable
to Louisiana. Congress, however, did not leave this matter open to
any doubt; the fourth section is peremptory: " That nothing in this
act contained, shall be construed to extend. to any court of the United
States, which is now established, or which may hereafter be established in the state of Louisiana." 8 Laws U. S. 63.
There is no phrase so potent as this, "nothing in this act shall
be so construed:" it has not only the effect of an exception, a limitation or proviso; it is a positive and absolute prohibition against any
construction by the judicial power, by which the thing prohibited
shall be sanctioned. The effect of these words in the 11th amendment of the constitution, hag been adjudged by this Court to annul
all jurisdiction over cases actually pending therein, past, present and
future; though the constitution had expressly given jurisdiction in the
very case. 3 Dall. 382, 3; 6 Wh. 405, 9.
"A denialof jurisdiction forbids all inquiry into the nature of the
case." 9 Wh. 847. "The constitution must be construed, as it would
have been had the jurisdiction of the Court never been extended to
it." 9 Wh. 858, S. P; 9 Wh. 206, 7, 16; '12 Wh. 438, 9.
No construction, therefore, can be put on the act of 1828 which
will make it applicable to the practice of Louisiana; how, then, this
Court could apply the act of 1792, in direct oppogition to the subsequent acts of 1804, 1805, 1824 and 1828, was, and is, to me, a
matter of most especial surprise. The provisions of the acts 'of
1792 and 1828, so far as they refer to the rules &c., of courts of law
and of equity jurisdiction, as contradistinguished from each other, are
identical; it was, therefore, perfectly nugatory to exclude Louisiana
from the operation of the act of 1828, and leave the act of 1792 in
force within that state. It was worse than idle; it was a solemn
mockery, a legislative farce, a trifling with the people of that state,
after a uniform course of legislation, for twenty-four years; on a subject upon which all people are peculiarly sensitive; their local laws,
usages and 'customs.
Accustomed to the civil law, the first settlers of Louisiana, their
descendants and emigrants'thereto, cling to it, as we of the old,
states do, and our ancestors' did cling to the common law, as a
cherished inheritance. Had congress declared in 1804, what this
Court did in 1835; or had there been a fifth section to the act*of
1828, enacing, that the process act of 1792, was in force in Louisiana,
it may well be imagined, what would have been the state of public

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

opinion. No such imputation rests on the legislative department as
would be fastened on its faith, if in either their first or last act, in
professing to imaintain and protect the people in their property, according to the plighted faith of the treaty of cession, had been to
deprive them of their laws, and force a foreign system upon them.
Nor for more than forty years after the act of 1792, ana thirty years
after the acquisition of Louisiana, had there been an intimation from
this Court, that that act applied to the courts of the United States
within it, either as a territory or a state. of the Union; the contrary
had been declared and adjudged.
In 1828, it'was decided that this act applied only to the states
then composing the Union; 1 Pet. 612. The declaration was repeated in 1833; 7 Pet. 451: and to leave no room for even discussion, this Court, at the same time held, that the act of 1824 was a
virtual repeal of all previous acts of congress on the subject; 650.
When this case came up, in 1835, it had been decided by this Court,
that the act of 1792 never was in force in the new states, and that it
was repealed as to Louisiana; the act of 1828, which applied to the
other new states, was expressly prohibited from being applied to
Louisiana; yet the act of 1792 was declared to be in force then.
If I am capable of comprehending this decision, it repeals five acts
of congress; directly overrules three previous solemn decisions of the
Court; revives an act which had been repealed; extends to Louisiana
a law which never applied to any other new state; and overthrows
every thing which carries with it legislative or judicial authority.
As a precedent, it is of the most alarming tendency; no question, in
my opinion, can be settled, if this was an open one in 1835. Congress
may legislate, and this Court adjudicate in vain; if the acts of the one,
and the judgments of the other, are thus to be contemned. My respect for both, forbids my assent to such a course, or my acquiescence
in a principle which must absolve judges from their obligation to
follow the established rules of their predecessors; in the construction
of laws, and the settled course of the law.
Having entirely dissented from a rule laid down oy this Court in
Green v. The Iessee of Neal, 6 Pet. 299; wherein the majority of
the Court put and answer the question, "Would not a change in the
construction of a law of the United States by-his tribunal, be obligatory on the state courts? The statute, as last expounded, would be
the law of the Union; and wily may not the same effect be given to
the last exposition of a local law, by the state court?"

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

That the principle of "legis posteriores priores contrarias abrogant," is sound, when applied to legislative acts, all admit; but it is an
innovation upon all rules, to apply it as a general rule to the exposition of statutes, which have received a settled construction by a court
of the last resort. It is an assumption of legislative power, and a
reversal of the established principle, that judges cannot amend or
alter the law, but must declare what it is; and from the very nature
of such a rule as is laid down in Green v. Neal, the law can never be
settled, so as to be binding on the judges of this Court; as is most
clearly illustrated in this case.
In 1835, there had been three solemn decisions, either of which
was conclusive; that the act of 1792 was not in force ifi Louisiana;
and there had been an uninterrupted course of practice in the district
court of the United States, sanctioned by acts of congress and this
Court, for more than thirty years. One judge only dissented in the
case of Parsons v. Bedford; but it was because, in his opinion, the
Court did not adhere, with sufficient strictness, to the state practice;
3 Pet. 452. In the cases in I Pet. 612, and 7 Pet. 450, the Court
appear to have been unanimous; all the judges had then concurred
in opinion on the very point which arbse at the former argument;
and the act of 1828, was a direct legislative sanction of the judgment of the Court in the former case, being adopted to cure the
defect of the nonapplication of the act of 1792, to the new states.
There were but five judges present, who took part in the former decision, two of whom dissented; so that the case was determined by
only three judges. I do not mean to assert, that the effect of a judgment depends on the mere number of judges who concur in it; but
I do assert, most distinctly, that such a decision does not settle the
law, in opposition to three previous solemn and unanimous adjudications. If the question thus decided, remained open; there is, to my
mind, neither reason, precedent, nor principle, to sanction the doctrine that any judge is bound by the last decision, when he is not
bound by former ones. When three last decisions can be overruled,
it is strange that one cannot be. The decision of 1833 was. the last,
befre another was made. The act of 1792 was then declared to have
been repealed, and never to hrve been in force in Louisiana; yet no
respect was paid to it, or the one in 1830 or 1828; neither of them
were thought deserving of even a passing notice, or the roost remote
reference to them. The act of'1828 was treated in the same manner.,
as alike unworthy of attention.

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

Had any other department or officer of the government, any circuit
or district court of the United States, or any state court; thus drawn
a sponge over these acts of congress, and our repeated decisions upon
them; it would have been justly deemed a disregard of the constituted
authorities.'
I freely admit that a court may and ought to revise its opinions;
when, on solemn and deliberate consideration, they are convinced of
their error. It is often done, though never without the fullest investigation; even then, one decision does not settle the law; when they
are contradictory, the matter is open for future research. There is
no more certainty that a last opinion is more correct than the first.
Generally speaking, a construction of a law nearest the time of its
passage, is most respected; and is adhered to, though there may be

lieved to be unprecedented, to consider a subsequent 'decision that
omits any reference to prior ones, and from some cause overlooks
them, though they are in point, and by a court of the last resort; as
having settled the law. If, however, such is the rule, it necessarily
follows, that it can only remain until another last decision shall be
made, restoring the old law, or making a new veysion of it.
A judge who, in 1835, was at liberty to make a last construction
of a law, is certainly as free in 1837, as he was two years before.
The very principle of this caso is, that prior decisions, though unanimous, are not binding; the next, in point of time, by a divided
court, can then be of no more authority; and a fortiori, one such
opinion cannot outweigh three contrary ones, unless every last decision has the same effect, whenever a present majority may think fit
to make one. To such a principle I can never yield assent, unless in
the last judgment of this Court, all prior ones have been fully considered; the more especially on such a subject as is involved in this
case; in which we were called on to repudiate the laws of a state of
this Union, and substitute therefor, by judicial power, a system
equally repugnant to the habits, the customs, and the choice of the
people. In introducing into Louisiana that part of the common law
which constitutes the law and practice of courts of equity, th6 other
part of the same system being concomnitaat, cannot be excluded; if it
is to be done, or can be done, it is oniy 'by the legislative power.
These were my reasons for dissenting from the judgment heretofore rendered in this cause; they still operate on my mind, in their
full force; they are, indeed, strengthened by the judgment noiw

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

given; which seems to me as repugnant to the former, as that was to
all former ones, and the existing laws.
The controversy between these parties is xespecting real property
of great value; the plaintiff claims it, subject to the payment of a certain sum of money; the defendant claims it as his own absolutely, by
purchase from the plaintiff, pursuant to several contracts made according to the forms of the law of Louisiana. The suit was commenced by a bill in equity, according to the form of process adapted
to such courts; and contrary to the practice of the district court, fizom
the first organization of a territorial government in Louisiana,' in
1804, till the filing of the bill in 1834; vide Record, 2 to 6, 8 to 12.
A demurrer was put in, assigning two causes. 1. That plaintiff had
not set out such a case as entitled him to any discovery or relief in
any court of equity in the state. 2. That by the bill it appeared
that the transaction complained of, was between the plaintiff or one
side, and the defendant and one'Fort on the other, whose heirs were.
not made parties, Record, p. 7; 9 Peters, 6, 36: that this was necessary by-the law and practice of Louisiana, was admitted. It -wasnot
a matter of mere form or practice, that the heirs of Fort should be
made parties; the transadtion was a joint one. Story had purchased
from Fort, and paid him a large sum of money for his interest in th6
property. To Story therefore, it was highly important, that when the
original transactio yeas to be unravelled, he should not alone be held
ahswerable to the plaintiff, and be compelled to reconvey, without
his partner being compelled t9 contribute. By the law of the state,
he had a right to this protection; it was equitable too, that the plaintiff should be compelled to call into court all the parties who had
been concerned: to th6 defendant it was but justice that he should
not be put to his remedy against his associate, and the consequences
be visited -on him alone. This right to have the heirs of Fort
brought in, was absolute, had the plaintiff sued in the mode prescribed by the law and practice of the state; it was a substantial
benefit to Story, of which he could have been deprived in no other
way, than on abrogation of the established course of proceeding, then
in force in the state. This was done by the Court in overruling the
demurrer on both points: tt declared that the process act of 1792
applied tothe case; and as the defendant, at the time of filing the
bill, was the only person claiming or possessing the property, none
other need be made a party, 9 Pet. 658, 9. By the terms of this act,
"the forms and modes of proceeding in suits in equity, &c., which
VOL. XI.-3 E

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

are to be pursued in the federal courts, is not confined to the mere
process employed;" it is to be "according to the principles, rules,
and usages, which belong to courts in equity," &c. 1 Story, 258.
When it is recollected, that there is no statute in England which defines the jurisdiction of these courts, or prescribes their course, the
whole law or code of equity jurisprudence is necessarily made up
of its own "principles, rules, and usages," which make it a system,
as contradistinguished from that which prevails in courts of law.
When too, we look to its adoption by the judiciary and process acts,
it is at once apparent, that its effects go far beyond forms and practice; if it is in force in Louisiana, it does not stop at substituting an
English bill, for a civil law petition; the whole law of equity, as
a distinct code, neceisarily accompanies it, by the very words of
the act of 1792. So it must have been understood by the court, or
they would have directed the heirs of Fort to be made a party to "a
bill of equity;" as they must have done, had the proceeding been
by petition. On this point their language is most explicit in using
the very words of the act of 1792. "And that in the modes of proceeding, that court was required to proceed according to the principles, rules, and usages, which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of law," 9 Pet. 655. So again; "as the
courts of the Union have a chancery jurisdiction in every state, and
the judiciary at confers the same chancery powers on all, and gives
the same rules of decision, its jurisdiction in Massachusetts," (and of
course in Louisiana,) "must be the same as in other states." 656.
And if no such laws and rules applicable to the 6ase exist in Louisiana, then such equity powers must be exercised according to the
principles, usages, and rules of the circuit courts of the United
States, as regulated and prescribed for the circuit courts in the other
states of the Union, 660. There can, therefore, be no mistake in
considering, that the whole system of English equity jurisprudence
henceforth is the law of Louisiana, both in form and substance, vide,
659; if the judgment first rendered in this case is the settled law of
the land.
, In its present aspect then, the suit must be taken as a bill in equity,
to be decided on, and by the same principles, rules, and usages, which
would form the law of equity in a circuit court of any other state.
In so viewing this case, there seem to me insuperable objections
to the relief prayed for in the bill; even on the plaintiff,'s own showing, and the documents referred to.

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]
The first contract between the parties was, in form, an absolute
sale, in July 1822, for the consideration of twenty-five thousand dollars; of even date there was a defeasance or dounter-letter, stipulating for a reconveyance, on payment of that sum in February 1823,
and in case of nonpayment the property to be sold. In March 1823,
an agreement was made, extending the time till June, stipulfting the
terms. The sale was postponed at plaintiff's request, and a new
agreement made, whereby he was to pay Fort and Story twentyseven thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars, on the 5th of-August, otherwise the property was to be absolute in them, and the defeasance to be cancelled, so as to bar any equity of redemption; the
declared intention being, "to vest in Fort and Story a full title, in fee
simple, forever." The plaintiff not paying the money, the defeasance
was cancelled; and Fort and Story remained in the possession and
enjoyment of the property In his bill the plaintiff alleges, that the
original transaction was a loan of money, for the security of which
the contracts were executed; and rests his whole case upon that allegationt he avers no fraud or unfairness on the part of Story or Fort,
no ignorance of his rights, of any fact or matter in any way material
to him, when the subsequent agreements were made. His only
equity is in averring, that the property was worth more than the
sum he had received, his inability to repay it, owing to the -great
pressure for money in 1822 and 3, the nonapplication of seven thousand dollars, which sum was to have been expended in improvements
on the property; and that it was worth one hundred and twenty
thousand dollars at the time of suit brought, in 1834. In such a case,
a court of equity would look for the equity of the case in the acts
of the plaintiff in March, June, and August, 1823; and if not satisfied
that the release of all right of redemption, and the agreement that
the right of Fort and Story should become absolute in fee simple,
was made in ignorance by the plaintiff, or by fraud, or imposition by
the defendant, the plaintiff could have no standing in court. Admitting the first contract to have been a mortgage, the parties voluntarily changed its nature on the application of the plaintiff; his object
was to avoid a sale, and to gain time till the pressure subsided; but
finding it continuing, he preferred making the transaction an absolute sale, rather than expose the property to a public sale during the
pressure.
If better terms could have been obtained than were offered by
Fort nmd Storv, or if the avermnefit in the bill that it was worth

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston.v. Story.]

60,000 dollars, in 1823, was true, it is incredible that the plaintiff
should have be~n so desirous of keeping it out of the market; or that
he would have entered into the agreement of June, if he .could have
obtained a better price from others. Be this, however, as it may,
the mere inadequacy of price is of no consequence in equity; courts
will never set aside a contract on this ground, if it is free from all
other objections: the agreements of March and June were solemn,
deliberate, and executed according to the solemnities of the civil law;
and were binding by all the rules and principles of the English system of equity. By that law, Mr. Livingston was not a minor,
deemed incapable of managing his own affairs; neither is ignorance
of the law or facts of his own, case, imputable to him; and he shows
iihis bill no reason why he should not be bound by his contracts,
or why le should have them annulled.
As a mortgagor in the first instance, a court of equity would protect him against any unfair release of his equity of redemption to the
mortgagee; yet, if fairly made, it would be as valid as if he had conveyed it to a third person. So far from any equity arising to him
from the rise in the value of the property from 1823, till 1834; it is,
in my opinion, a strong circumstances in favour of the defendant,
who advanced his money during a severe pressure, when he could
have purchased this property at auction, at a rate below its estimated
value, proportioned to the demand for .money, or have purchased
from others. This ground of relief, however, entirely fails, when
we consider the answer of the defendant; he denies the whole equity
of the bill, as well as every aliegation on which it rests; the answer
is responsive to the bill, is full and explicit; and the plaintiff has not
disproved one fact or averment contained in it; or proved any one
matter averred in his bill. It is distinctly denied, that the original
transaction was a loan; that the property was worth more than the
sum' to be paid for its reconveyance, or to.prevent a sale; the nonapplication of the 7000 dollars i§ accounted for in a manner which
throws on the plaintiff all its .consequences; and shows it to have
l6een by his own acts, and those of the person for whom he was surety
to the defendant. These circunistances alone, would take from him
any. standing in a court of equity in England, or any circuit court of
a state. Another view of the case is equally conclusive; on an inspection of the bill, answer, and exhibits.
The plaintiff did not rest his ease on the documentdry evidence;
he averred the transaction to have been different from what was ex-

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

pressed in the written agreement; and called for the aid of a court of
equity to compel the defendant to disclose the real nature and character of the original contract, and the true intentioni of the parties,
on his oath. By this, be made the answer to the bill and interrogatories, evidence; it is directly responsive, full, and positive, and supported by evidence of the most satisfactory kind; the written application of the plaintiff's agent to Fort and Story, on the 13th July,
preceding the first agreement. Vide ante, p. 360. No attempt
was made by the plaintiff to prove the averment, that a loan was intended; so ihat there was nothing in the case which could vary the
terms of the writing. The only original contract, was, then, the
conveyance; and the defeasance, or counter-letter, taken in c6nnectidn as one agreement, the terms of which show its legal character
to bc a conditional sale, and not a imortgage; when tested by the
rules of equity as recognised by this Court.
To make such a transaction a mortgage, it is indispensable to show
that the party receiving the money was bound to repiy it; unless it
clearly appears, from the evidence, that a loan was intended; and
that the form of a sale was adopted as a cover for usury. The principal and interest must be secure; there must be h remedy against
the person of the vendor or the borrower, and clear proof that he
was liable. 7 Cr. 236, 7; 9 Pet. 445, to 454. If it is not proved
by extrinsic evidence that a loan was intended, and the party bound
to repay it, it matters not how extravagant the terms of repurchase
may be: the redemption must be on the day stipulated; or the estate vests absolutely, if the principal was at hazard. lb. 455, 469.
Inadequacy of price is not a circumstance which will convert a conditional sale into a mortgage. 7 Cr. 241; and if the party makes ne
claim to the property while the other i s in possession, making valuable improvements on it without any notice of an intention to assert
a right of redemption, a court of equity will not aid him. 7 Cr. 240.
In the counter-letter, Mr. Livingston is not bound to repay the
money; Fort and Story had no remedy against him; had the property sold for, or been worth less than the sum advanced, the loss
was theirs. There is an averment in the bill 'that the plaintiff was
liable; but it is expressly denied by the answer, and the plaintiff has
nottffered a spark of evidence to contradict it; the protest made in
August was not to found an action; but was made as authentic evidence of the fact of nonpayment, and to silence the pretensions of
the plaintiff, as is expressly sworn to in the answer. Rec. p. 19. It

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

is also positive as tQ the value of the property at the time, and afterwards. "This deponent was repeatedly offered, after 1s23, by John
A. Fort, the half of the property at cost and charges; which he refused, considering the property not worth it. It has been only the
rise of all property in that part of the city where it is situated, that
has saved them from loss." Rec. 22.
Should it be thought worthy of inquiry, why they should pay for
the property more than it was worth in 1822 or 1823, the answer is
at hand. By the contract, eight thousand dollars of the money was
to be expended in improvements, which would have been so much
added to the value of the property; the plaintiff was security that
this sum should be so applied by Rust: trusting to this guaranty,
vide Record, 29, Fort and Story advanced the eight thousand dollars
to Rust, who misapplied it in the manner stated in the answer to the
interrogatories of the bill, Record, 22. In the answer if is also stated,
that plaintiff represented that a quantity of joists and iron work had
been found for the buildings then erecting; but, on inquiry, defendant found they had not been paid for, and he and Fort had been compelled to purchase them at a cost of one thousand three hundred and
seventy dollars. This sum, added to the seven thousand dollars misapplied by Rust, was a diminution of the value of the property more
than eight thousand dollars below what it would have been, ir the
plaintiff had fulfilled his guaranty, and made good his representation;
and the work done would be worthless unless the buildings had been
made' tenantable. Fort and Story had no option but to submit to
this loss, inasmuch as they had confided in the plaintiff, that he
would do what he had engaged to do, without holding him personally
bound to repay them the twenty-five thousand dollars; eight thousand three hundred dollars of which was lost to them in the manner
stated. To save themselves, they were thus compelled to advance
this sum, to put the buildings in the state they were stipulated for,
when they made the agreement. Under such circumstances, no
court of equity could have considered the transaction a mortgage; or
the plaintiff as entitled to any relief,'
On another ground, the plaintiff's case was divested of all semblance
of equity. He had laid by eleven years, after he had voluntarily
cancelled the counter-letter,- and surrendered the property by an absolute title in fee simple; during which time he had given no notice
of any claim on his part, or any intention to assert a right of redemption; while Fort and Story, to hlskaovledge, were making costly

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

407

(Livingston v. Story.]

improvements, undei the full belief that they owned it; as the plaintiff had solemnly engaged that they should own and hold it. He
waited till all risk was out of the question, when the speculation
was a certain great one; and, in his own good time, comes into a
court of equity, demanding a reconveyance, and offers to allow to
Story five per cent. per annum for the use of his money: but refusing even to make the heirs of Fort a party; though the plaintiff
knew, and stated in his bill, that Story, relying on his contract, had
purchased out his interest at a large advance.
For this delay the bill assigns no reason or excuse, nor can any be
'fourid in the whole record; none has been offered in argument, none
can exist to which any court of equity would listen, while it respected the principles laid down by this Court, at the same term in
which this cause was first before it.
"A court cf equity, which is never active in kelief against conscience, or public convenience, has always refused its aid to stale
demands, where the party slept upon his rights, or acquiesced for a
great length of time. Nothing can call forth this Court into activity,
but conscience, good faith, and resonable diligence. When these
are wanting, the Court is passive, and does nothing; laches and neglect are always discountenanced; and, therefore, from the beginning
of this jurisdiction, there was always a limitation of suits in this
Court. The same doctrine has been repeatedly recognised in the
British courts, as will abundantly appear from the cases already
cited. It has also repeatedly received the sanction of the American
courts, &c. And it has been acted upon in the fullest. manner by
this Court, especially in," &c. Piatt v. Vattier, 9 Pet. 416, 17.
With submission,.then, it must be asked, vhy this principle should
not be applied to this case? There can be none which calls more
loudly for it; it is a fundamental rule by which all courts of equity
act: it is an essential part of that system of equity, which, in this
very case, this Court, two. years ago, held to be in force in Louisiana;
as well in the principles and rules of decision) as in matterdof practice, furnishing the law of the.case, in place of the local law which,
was then suppressed. In Louisiana, ten years is a positive bar 'by
limitation, when the law is.applied; the principle of analogy, therefore, would apply to .Ashorter period than in other states, where the
time of limitation is twenty rears. In such a case, and circumstanced as this case is, the lapse of eleven years, wholly unaccounted
for; would be as fatal to the plaintiff's claim in any court of equity,

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.] .

in England; in any of the states, or in this Court; as if it had continued for -any period, howevr long. The same question may be
put as to the rules and principles on which equity acts, or would act,
in annulling contracts like those of March, June, and August, 1823;
also as to the established rules in deciding on what is a conditional
sale, or a mortgage, as likewise declared at the same. time; 9 Pet.
445, &c.
One answer has been given to all questions which can be put, if
this case is to be decided by the English system of equity jurisprudence, as adopted by the process act of 1792; and declared to be a
part of the law of Louisiana in 1835. It is now most solemnly adjudged, that this case is not to be determined by "the principles,
rules, and usages, of courts of equity, as contradistinguished from
courts of law;" that it depends on, and is governed-by the Louisiana
law of- antechresis or mortgage; by which no length of possession,
no amount expended in improvements, no laches of a mortgagor,
however incompatible with every principle of common justice, or
English equity, can bar a redemption without a sale. Nay, this law
by the decree as now made, declares Mr. Livingston to be a minor,
under a pupilage so strict, that his contracts, in relation to this property, are mere paper and packthread; and his pledged faith, that
Fort and Story should hold and enjoy,it, idle wind; because no sale
was made, on account of his repeated and most urgent efforts to prevent it. He too, the distinguished jurist who revised and compiled
codes for Louisiana, and was deeply versed in all the details of its
laws; asks this Court to give him the benefit of this law of antichresis, on the only ground on which it can give him a decree for
property, without irretrievably compromitting that, which he deemed
far more valuable-his character.
Fort and Story did not intend to pay their money on such a contract as an antichresis. Mr. Liingston did rit intend to mislead or
deceive them by persuading them to waive a sale, which, under such
a contract, was indispensable to bar his right of redemption; he did
not cancel the counter-letter, and pledge himself that his equity of
redemption wag forever extinguished, knowing that the law incapacitated hip from doing it. Fort and Story never contemplated that
their only right to the property, was only a pledge upon it for their
money and legal interest; nor could it have entered into their minds,
that by indulging Mr. Livingston in avoiding a public sale, they were
thereby giving him the sole benefit of their capital,, expended in the

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

409

[Livingston v. Story.]

purchase and improvements, as well as the appreciation in value of
the property. That an antichresis was ever in their -minds, cannot
be pretended; or that he knew that the contract was of that-nature,
and intended to alail himself of it, if a change of times should make
it his interest to do so, when the property rose to a sufficient value,
while he held out to Fort and Story that their title was perfect; is incredible. He must have been as ignorant of the law as they were,
and both have intended the tfansaction as a conditional sale; in such
a case, a court of equity would so reform the contract, as to make it
conform to the real intention of both parties: On the other hand, if
they intended the contract to be a conditional sale, and he intended it
to be a mortgage; there is a fatal bar to this case.
It was laid down by this Court, in 1835, that where the contract
was in terms a conditional sale, it would not be turned into a'mortgage, or the money be deemed a loan; -unless the 'intention to do so
was mutual. 9 Pet. 450. That it was not so in: this case, is manifest
from the conduct of the defendant, and his positive oath in his answer; which decidedly negative any mutuality of intention.
There are, then, the following distinct grounds of defence, on equitable principles, to the plaintiff's bill. 1. He has failed in adducing
any evidence, competent to vary the terms of the original contract.,
2. He has shown no ground for annulling the subsequent contracts,
or why they are not binding on him in equity. 3. All the averments
in the bill are positively denied by an answer directly responsive,
which remains uncontradicted, without an attempt to disprove any
part of it, or to support the bill. 4. The plaintiff was never bound to
repay the money;" and the defendant incurred the whole risk of a depression in the value of the property. 5. The defendant never intended to enter into a contract of loan or mortgage. 6. The plaintiff
is barred by the lapse of time and acquiescence, without, notice.
If then the decree of this CStnt, at this term, had been.rendered in
accordance with those "principles, rules, and usages of a court of
equity," which they adjudged two years before, to be the law of the
case, the decree of the court below must have been affirmed; yet is
now reversed, because the local law, which was wholly repudiated
then. is applicable now. Herein there seems to me an utter discrepancy, between the two decrees of this Court. In 1835, the practice
and law of Louisiana was displplced by the practice and law of equity;
by the rules of which the demurrer was overruled, when- it must
have been sustained; if the act of 1792 had not been in force in that
VOL. XI.-3 F

[Livingston v. Story.]

state. In 1837, the forms and modes of proceeding in equity are retained; which deprive the.defendant of the benefit of the law of the
state, compelling a plaintiff who sues for the redemption of mortgaged propbrty, according to the law of antichresis, to join all the
original parties; in consequence whereof the plaintiff retained his
standing in court, which he must otherwise have lost. The law'of
equity having thus performed its appointed office, is, in its turn, displaced by the state law, and ceases to be a rule of decision: the law
of antichresisis then brought in, to perform the final office of annulling the contracts of the parties; taking the property from the defendant, and awarding it to the plaintiff. Now, if the law of antichresis must govern this case, it is by sheer, dry, legal right; as destitute of any equity -as it is contra.y to its most sacred principles,
when applied to such a tase as this: by every rule of its action,
equity calls on the plaintiff to show "conscience" in his claim; "good
faith" in his conduct; and reasonable diligence ip pursuing his rights,
before it moves one step. Let the record answer how these calls have
been met. In his bill, the plaintiff holds the defendant to the most
strict rules of accounting, as a trustee or agent; he offers to pay, legal
interest, (which is five per cent.) on the money due in August, 1823;
say twenty eight thousand dollars; which, for eleven years at the time
of filing the bill, amounts to fifteen thousand four hundred dollars: so
that defendant would be entitled to a credit, in account, of forty-three
thousand four hundred dollars, from which must be deducted twentynine thousand seven hundred dollars, he had received f6r rents up to
1829, Record, 50; and at the rate stated, he would be indebted to the
plaintiff in 1834. The plaintiff would then regain a property, stated
in his bill to be worth"one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, and
by Mrs. Fort to be two hundred thousand dollars, and by the use of the
defendant's money; while Story is left to seek his remedy against her
for the fifty thousand dollars, paid her in 1832, for her share. In his
offer, the plaintiff omits any credit to the defendant, for taxes on the
property, or compensation as his bailiff and receiver, for collecting
the rents of the buildings erected with his own money; as it now
seems for the plaintiff's use; on an interest of five per cent. in New
O.leans. This is the conscience of the case. Its good faith can
be ascertained by the stipulations, and solemnly declared intentions
of the plaintiff, in the contracts of VIarch and June, 1823; Record, p.
278; the cancellationof the counter-letter; and after an utter silence
for eleven years, then, for the first time, asserting the contract to be

JA NUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

an antichresis; with a perpetual right of redemption, till a sale
was made by its authority. Reasonable diligence would seem to
consist in the plaintiff's pleasure; eleven years must be held not to
be "a great length of time," under the circumstances of this case; or
the utter silence, and want of notice for this period, must be held not
to be an "acquiescence" in the defendant's right. It has been a truly
fortunate result for the plaintiff, that with a case not sustainable by
either the practice or law of Louisiana, or by. the rules and princitiles
of a court of equity, separately; he has been able to attain his object
at one term, by one law, and at another term by the other; so happily applied, as to meet the exigencies of his case at both terms.
Had the one law been made the rule of decision on the whole case,
I might have acquiesced in the result: as it is, I am constrained to
dissent from the whole course of proceeding; as in my settled judgment, in direct conflict with the acts of congress, as *well as the
repeated and most solemn adjudications of this Court.
I have not examined into the law of antichresis in Louisiana, for
the want of the necessary books; conceding, however, that it is as
the Court has considered it, it gives the plaintiff a sheer legal right,
for the violatiori of which a court of equity is riot the proper'forum
to resort: the right being in contravention of the fundamental principle of such courts, the remedy must be in a court which decides
by the rules dnd principles of the civil law; to which code alone
such a contract is known.
There is one other matter, on which I also dissent from the opinion
of the Court; which has tao important an effect on the rules of pleading and practice in suits in equity, to be passed unnoticed; and is in
my opinion, a dangerous innovation, unsupported by principle or
precedent.
From the preceding view of this case it is apparent, that if' Mr.
Livingston had been a citizen of'Louisiana he could have sued only
in the cdurt of the state; his proceedings must have been according
to its practice and laws, by which he must have made Mrs. Fort a
party. Admitting his right to the property to be what this Court
have held it, it would have placed the defendant in a very different
position from that in which he now stand., without the least injury
or inconvenience to the plaintiff. Mrs. Fort would have been compelled to refund the rents she 'had received, which, by the decree,
the defendant must pay; together with the fifty thousand dollars she
xeceived from him, with. the accruing interest; as well as the loss
sustained by.receiving only five per cent. on their capital; and pro-

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

bably paying to banks eight or ten per cent. as is usual in Orleans.
Vide 3 Wheat. 146. By suing in a court of the United States, the
plaintiff, by the aid of the process act of 1792, has protected Mrs. Fort,
and thrown the whole loss on Mr. Story: leaving him the chances
of a suit with her, in place of the certain remedy, that a state court
would give him. To him it was no matter of form, practice, or
mode of proceeding, whether he was sued in the one or the other
court; it may be that his whole indemnity from Mrs. Fort depended
on it: to the plaintiff it mattered not, so that he obtained the benefit
of the law of antichresis, which the state court was bound to administer, as much as the court below was. The measure of justiceto
him was the same in both courts. It was by being a citizen of New
York, that this court enabled the plaintiff to overrule the demurrer;
by the application of the process act of 1792, the law of the case was
changed; so that it was a most important fact in its bearing on the
merits of the cause, .not one affecting the form or mode of proceeding
in the suit. It was averred in the bill, that the plaintiff was a citizen
of New York:. the defendant, in his answer, says, "that he does not
admit, but if it be the fact, requires proof that the complainant is a
citizen of the state of New York; that at the time of the transaction
mentioned in the bill, and for a long time thereafter, he was a citizen
of the state of Louisiana, and one of her senators in the congress of
the United States; and if he has ceased to be a citizen of that state,
the defendant knows not When, or how, and calls for proof." Rec. 16.
To this part of the answer an exception"was made, because the objection came too late after a demurrer had been overruled. Rec. 33. The
exception was overruled, 36, and the general replication was filed.
On the hearing, one deposition was read on the part of the plaintiff,
to prove the fact; but in my opinion it failed to do so. This, however, was not deemed material by the court; who held, that the averment of citizenship could be controverted in no other way than by
a plea in abatement: and that not having-done so, the defendant was
too late in reserving the denial till he answered; applying to the case
the same rule which prevails as to pleas to the jurisdiction of a court
of equity.
Had this been a suit by petition, according to the practice of the
state, a denial of the citizenship or alienage could have been made
in the answer', after a plea in bar, and the cause ordered for trial; it
was so, decided by this Court in 1833, declaring, that "the courts of
Louisiana do not proceed by the rules of the common law;" "their

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Li~ingston y. Story.]

code is founded on the civil law, and our inquiries must be confined to
its rules." 7 Pet. 429. This plea was offered after issuejoined on a
plea in bar, and after the argument had commenced. The court might
admit it, and the court might also reject it. It was in the discretion
of this Court to allow or reject this additional plea, Ib. 432. In 1
Pet. 612, it was decided, that a district court in a new state had
"power to create a practice for its own government" The practice
of the state courts adopted jy the district judge of Louisiana, has
been always recognised by this court, and acted on. 6 Pet. 198; 7
Pet. 429, 30; 8 Pet.303. In Brown v. Keene, this very objection was
taken in the answer, and considered by the Court; 8 Pet. 112, ll.
Such being the established practice of the court below, sanctioned
by this Court, and the act of 1824; the plaintiff would have been
bound to prove this averment, and considered himself so bound by
the attempt to do it; but this Court has relieved him by expunging
the state practice, and substituting what they assume to be the equity
practice of courts of chancery in England. The consequence of
which is, that the defendant is not allowed to deny by his answer,-a
fact averred in the bill, unless by a plea in abatement, in which he
takes on himself the burthen of disproving it: of course, if he fails
in doing so, the averment must be taken to be true, without any
proof offered by the plaintiff to sustain it. That this decision of the
Court is as repugnant to its ow'n principles often declared, and to the
rules of pleading in equity cases, as it is to the recognised practice of
the court below; is clear to mymind.
By the 18th rule prescribed -bythis Court, "for ihe practice of the
courts of equity of the United States;" "the defendant may at any
time before the bill is taken for confessed, or afterwaids with the
leave of the Court, demur or plead to the whole bill, or part of it;
and he may demur to part, plead to part, and answer to the residue,"
&c. 7 Wheat. ix.
By the 23d rule, "the defendant, instead of filifig a formal demurrer orplea, may insist on any special matter in his answer; and have
the same benefit thereof, as if he had pleaded the same matter or had
demurred to the bill," lb. x.
When this case was before this Court two years agb, this was their
language. OIt is an established and universal rule of pleading in
chancery; that'a defendant may meet a complainant's bill by several
mdes of defence. He may demur, answer and plead to different
parts of a bill," 9 Pet. 658. Such were the rules- of equity then.

SUPREME COURT.
[Livingston v. Story.]

There must have been a great change in equity practice since, if a
defendant may not now deny in his answer any averment in the
bill; or call for proof of any fact averred, as to Which he has not sufcient knowledge, to be safe in admitting or denying it.
When he answered this bill, there was no rule of this or any court
of equity, by which the averment of citizenship was exempted from
the special rules of this Court, or 'the established and universal rule
of pleading in chancery:" it was not a privileged allegation, but like
all others material to the plaintiff's standing in Court, he was bound
to prove it when called on by an answer, which did not admit, or
put it in issue by a denial. It is hard, indeed, on the defendant, that
he suffers under the adoption of a rule unknown to the law or practice of equity; when he put in his answer, his counsel looked to the
existing rules, after he found that the rules of the state practice had
been superseded; and must hive felt safe in following those which
had been laid down as universal, in that opinion which fastened the
equity code of England on the state and people of Louisiana. They
had a right to .confide in its future administratipn, according to the
rules and principles promulgated by that tribunal; which by its own
power imposed it on them. It has been held by this Court for more
than forty years, that an express averment of citizenship is necessary
to enable a citizen of one state to sue in the federal court of another;
,that it is a special privilege, conferred by the constitution and the
judiciary act, to which the plaintiff must show his right by the
record; that the averment must be positive, and not in the alternative, 8 Wheat. 112; that it must be in the body of the bill, and does
not suffice that it is in the title or caption; that it is not only a fatal
defect after a final decree; but is deemed so important that the judges
feel bound to nctice it, though counsel do not, 8 Pet. 148.
When the whole action of a court of equity on a bill, which does
not, in its body, contain .this averment in positive terms, is thus a
mere nullity, and a final decree does not cure the defect: it is a most
strange conclusion, that it cannot be denied by the answer, or the
plaintiff be put to its proof; that as one of the allegataof the bill it
is indispensable, while as one of theprobata,it is immaterial. As the
defect goes to the jurisdiction of the C9urt, it would seem consonant
to reason, as well as to law, that if the averment of the fact was material, its truth was equally so ; yet if the doctrine of the Court is
sound, the defendant cannot put the plaintiff on proof of it, or make
it a matter in issue on which he can adduce negative evidence. By

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

putting the defendant to his plea in abatement, the Court seem to me
to have overlooked its requisites. Such a Plea must be on oath; and
it must give the plaintiff a better writ or bill, by pointing out how
he ought to sue: such are its requisites in a suit of law or equity. I
Day's Com. Dig. 151; 1 P. Wins. 477; Beame, 92, 3; 1 Ves. Sr.
203, 4.

The requisites of all pleas in equity are also overlooked. A plea
must set up matter not in the bill; some new fact as a reason why the
bill should be delayed, dismissed, or not answered; or the plea will
be overruled; Mit. 177, 9; Beame, 2,-7; 2 Madd. R. 346, Am. ed.
The nature and effect of a plea to the jurisdiction of a court of
equity, are also wholly misapprehended. It does not deny tfie plaintiff's right to relief; or that the bill does not contain matter pr'oper
for the cognisance of a court of equity; but.it is made on the ground,
that the court of chancery is not the prope'r one to decide it: it admits the jurisdiction of equity, but asserts that some other court can
afford the remedy,; Mit. 180; Beame, 57. This" must be done by
matter set up in the plea; because the court of chancery, being one*of
general jurisdiction in equity, an exception must be made-out by the
party who elairms an exemption, in order to arrest its jurisdiction.
Mit. 186; Beame, 57, 91; 1 Vern. 59; 2 Vern. 483; 1 Ves. Sr. 264.
This objection must be by plea, and cannot be taken by demurrer: it
must show what court has cognizance of the case: 'that it is a court
of" equity, and can give the plaintiff a remedy: if no circumstance
can give jurisdiction to the court of chancery, then no plea is necessary; a demurrer is good; Mit. '123, 4; Beame, 100, 1; 1 Atk.
544; 1 Saund. 74; 1 Dick. 129; 3 Br. Ch. 301; 2 Ves. Sr. 357.
From this view of a plea to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery in England, it must be manifest that there is and can be no
analogy between its jurisdiction and that of a circuit or distfict
court, sitting as such: the former being general, attaches to every
case not brought within an exception, by ma'ter specially pleaded,
showing that the case is cognizable in some inferior court of equity,
competent to give the relief prayed: the latter is special, and limited
to the cases specially enumerated, within which the plaintiff must
bring himself, by averment and proof of the necessary fact. A denial of this fact does not oust an existing general jurisdiction; it puts
in issue the only fact which can give the Court cognizance of the
case: no fact or matter not in the bill, is set up by way of avoidance
or delay, or as a reason for not answering; nothing is put in issue

[Livingston v. Story.]

I

but the truth of the allegation, in which the plaintiff claims a right
and pfivilege,.denied to the*citizens of Louisiana.. He has claimed,
and the Court have granted him a much higher privilege, than that
of merely suing in a federal court; he is exempted from the obligation of suing, according to the law and practice of the state; the
benefit of the-equity code of England is given to him, and the defendant deprived of the right secured to him by the law of. the state,
that. of having the heirs of his former partner made a party. The
plaintiff's privilege is the defendant's oppression; the plaintiff is a
favoured suitor; not because he is a citizen of New York in truth or
in fact, but merely because he says in his bill that he is; and the defendant must submit to all the consequences of the averment being
true, unless he will also consent to undergo the perils and inflictions
of a plea in abatement. We have seen what its requisites are: now
letthem be applied to this case, and the consequences of such a plea.
It must be on oath, the.fact is-not within his knowledge; he swears
to a negative of-a fact asserted in the bill, whereby he is compelled
to incur the risk of perjury. As pleas in abatement in the court of
chancery are governed by the same rules as. in a court of law, 1"
Yes. Sen. 203; Beame, 89, 90; there is another rule worthy of notice:
"If the plaintiff take issue on a plea in abatement, and it be found
against the defendant, then final judgment is given against him." 2
Saund. 111, a, note 3, and cases cited. He must therefore incur the
danger of a final decree against him, if he does not make out his
negative issue. His plea must be overruled, because it sets up no
matter not in the bill. 'He must give the plaintiff a better writ or
bill, by showing that some other court of equity has cognizance of
the case: this is impossible in Louisiana, in which there is no such
court: his plea is then bad, because he cannot comply with the requisites, unless it is incumbent on him to do it, in the only possible
way left him. He can set up new matter,by averring that the plaintiff is a citizen of some other state than New York or Louisiana, and
thus give the plaintiff a better bill:. but then the same court would
have jurisdiction, so that the plea would be nugatory, and subject
the defendant to all the consequences which he sought to avoid.
The. reason given for the rule of pleading, in chancery, shows its entire inapplicability to a suit in a federal court. "The reason of this
is, that in suing fdr his right, a person is not to be sent every where
to look for a jurisdiction; but must be told what other court has
jurisdiction, or what other writ is proper for him, and this is matter

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Livingston v. Story.]

of which the court, where the action is brought, is to judge." 1 Ves.
Sr. 203. The plaintiff knows his own residence.
It would be the most perfect anomaly in pleading, to draw up a
plea to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery- in the English form,
and apply it to a bill in equity in a circuit court of the United States,
so as to meet the averment of citizenship of the plaintiff; according
to the present decision of this Court. Its exhibition to an equity
pleader in Lincoln's Inn, who would read our constitution, the judiciary act, the rules and decisions of this Court, would not fail to
cause him to admire it as an improvement in the science of pleading. For myself, I am utterly unable to comprehend, that the denial of an averment of a fact in a bill can be deemed aplea of any
kind, unless it is the general issue, or a special issue on that fact; to
be a plea in abatement, or in bar, every rule of pleading in law or
equity requires that it should set up some matter not in the bill.
And I can imagine no greater departure from the practice and principles of equity, than to deprive a defendant of the right of denying
a fact stated in the bill, unless by exposing himself to the perils, add
incurring the consequences of a plea in abatement. If the decision
now made, remains the law of the Court, the rule must be carried
out to all its consequences. Equity pleading is a science; its settled
rules form an admirable system; but an innovation upon them would
produce the most crying injustice. To my mind, there cannot be a
case which can more forcibly illustrate the dangerous effects than the
present; when the record is examined, and its judicial history compared, throughout its progress to its present state, with the acts of
congress, the rules of practice, and decisions of this Court.
For these reasons, I feel constrained to express my dissent to the
whole course of the Court in this case: whether it is tested by the
practice and law of Louisiana, or the English system of equity, it is
an entire departure from both, if I can understand either. The transition from the one system to the other, in the different stages of the
cause, each operation to the manifest prejudice of the defendant; tends,
in my opinion, to the worst of all consequences; utter uncertainty in
the administration of the law in Louisiana. If the legislative or judicial authority of the Union could, command any respect, the process act of 1792, never did or could apply to that state: if both are
overruled by one decision, it cannot be expected that the solemn adjudications of this Court will'hereafter be deemed better evidence of
its rules of practice, or the principles of equity, than they have been

in their bearing on the present case. My opinion on the general
equity and merits of the case is as much at variance with that of the
Court, as it is on the subjects to which my attention has been mainly
directed: I have forborne an examination of this part of the case,
for obvious reasons. Whether the property in question, however
valuable, shall be held by the plaintiff, or defendant, is a matter of
small concern, compared with the consequences which must follow
from the decrees rendered; if the opinions and reasoning of the Court
must henceforth be taken as the established law.

This cause came on to be heard on'the transcript of the record
from the district court of the United States, for the eastern district
of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,
it .is ordered and adjudged, and decreed, that the decree of the said
district court, dismissing the bill of the complainant, be, and the
same is'hereby reversed and annulled; the Court being of opinion
that the transaetion.of the 25th of July, 1822, between John A,
Fort, Benjamin Story, ahd Edward Livingston, was a loan to the
said-Edward Livingston, secured by a pledge, denominated an aitichresis, in the law of Louisiana. And it is hereby further ordered,
adjudged, and decreed, that the cause be sent back for further proceedings in the court below, with directions that the cause be referred to a master, t6 take an account between the parties. And it is
herebyTurther ordered, adjudged,.and decreed, that in taking said
account, there be allowed to the defendant all advances which shall
be shown to have been made by him, or paid on account of the loan
made to Edward Livingston, on the 25th day of July, in the year
1822, with the interest which the said Edward Livingston agreed to
pay, of eighteen per cent. per annum, to be calculated upon cash advances, from the time it was made until the 5th of August, 1823, and
after that time, at legal interest. And further, that in taking said
account, the. defendant be allowed alLreasonable expenditures made
by the defendant, and John A. Fort, in building, repairing, and safe
keeping of the property pledged.by the said Edward Livingston, to
secure the loan made to him on the 25th day of July, 1822, and that
the -complainant be credited in such account .with all such sums as
the defendant, or John A Fort, or either of them have 'eceived from
the said property; and that, in taking such account, the rents and
profits be applied first, to the payment of the sums necessarily incur-

red in building and repairing. Secondly, to the payment of the
interest on the sums which shall appear to have been advabce.d on
the said loan, or in the improvemert of the lot. And thirdly, to the
discharge of the principal of the said loan. And if, on taking said
account, it shall appear that there is a balance due to the complain-'
ant, it is hereby further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the defendant pay to the complainant such balance, within six months from
the time of entering the final decree in the cause, and shall surrender
and reconvey the said propertyto the comlilainant, or such person.
or persons as shall b shown to be entitled to tie same. And if,
upon the taking of said account, it shall be found that any balance is
due from the estate of the said Edward Livingston, deceased, to the
defendants, itis hereby further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that
on paying or tendering to the defendant the said balance, he shall
deliver up the possession, an&y reconvey to the person or persons who
shall appear to be entitled to the same, the property so pledged, to
secure the aforesaid loan. And it is further ordered, adjudged, and
decreed, that in case a balance shall be' found due to the defendant,
and shall not be paid within six months after", 4Tnal decree of the district court, then the said property shall be sold at such time and on
such notice as the said court shall direct; and that the proceeds be
first applied to the payment of the balance due the defendant, and
the residue thereof be paid to the complainant
