JACKSON, A CITIZEN OF THE

STATE OF VIRGINIA, AND

OTHERS, CITIZENS OF THAT STATE V. THE REVEREND WILLIAM

E.

ASHTON, A CITIZEN OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

The appellants filed a bill in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, claiming-to have a
bond and mortgage cancelled and delivered up to them. They.alleged that the
same was given without consideration; was induced by threats of a prosecution
for a criminal offence against the husband of the mortgagor; and that the instruments were, therefore, void; and that they were obtained by the influence the
mortgagee exercised over the mortgagor, he being a clergyman, and her religious
visiter; and her mind being weak or impaired. ...The circuit court of Pennsylvania
dismissed the bill; and on appeal to this Court the decree of the circuit court was
affirmed.
A court of chancery will often refuse to enforce a contract, when-it would also refuse to annul it. In such a case, the parties are left to their remedy at law.
No admissions in an answer to a bill in chancery can, under any circumstances, lay
the foundation for relief under any specific head of equity; inless .it be substantially set forth in the bill.

APPEAL from the circuit court of the United States for the Pennsylvania district.
The principal facts of the case, as stated in the opinion of the
court, were as follow:The appellants, who are the devisees of Maria Goodwin, brought
their bill to set aside a bond and mortgage executed by Maria Goodwin, and her trustee, Kenneth Jewell, to the defendant, on the 5th
of January, 1829, to secure the payment of 3000 dollars. The bill
represents that the mortgage was given without consideration; that
shortly after the decease of Thomas Goodwin, the husband of Mrs.
Goodwin, which took place in February, 1828, the defendant stated
to her that he had a demand against her husband, to whom she had
been much attached, and who had treated him extremely ill; that he
had it in his power to render his memory odious, by exposing his con-.
duct; but that he would conceal the transaction, if she would execute
a mortgage to him on her own property, to secure the debt; that
she refused to execute the mortgage, or give any other security, by
the advice of her counsel; and afterwards avoided his visits to get
clear of his importunities: that shortly after this Mrs. Goodwin was

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

taken 'ill, and being executrix, her husband's affairs pressed much
upon her, and she fell into a Irw nervous state of spirits, which impaired her memory and affected her mind; that whilst she was in
this state, the defendant renewed his visits; and, professing great
kindness for her, took upon himself the management of her business;
and, having gained her confidence, prevailed upon her, in the absence of any friend or legal adviser, to execute the mortgage, and a
corresponding bond, and to direct that her trustee should join in
the execution; the defendant, as a clergyman, saying she ought to do
so: that these representations had great influence on Mrs. Goodwin,
who was a woman of devout religious feelings.
The complainants further represent, that at the time the bond and
mortgage were executed, Mrs. Goodwin was utterly incapable of understanding or comprehending their meaning and effect; that after
the death of Mrs. Goodwin, the defendant stated to the complainants, that the mortgage was executed as collateral security for any
sum that might be due to him from the estate of Thomas Goodwin,
deceased.
In his answer, the defendant admits the execution of the bond and
mortgage, and states, that in eighteen hundred -and twenty-two, being
about to receive a sum of money, he consulted Thomas Goodwin,
who N4as then a broker in Philadelphia, in what way he could most
advantageously invest it. That Goodwin advised him to leave the
money in his hands, and that he would loan it out on good security.
That the defendant, in pursuance of this advice, placed three thousand
four hundred dollars in his hands, and also loaned him two hundred
and seventy-five dollars; and took his notes by way of acknowledgment,
That Goodwin received a bond and mortgage for twenty-six hundred dollars, in favour of defendant, from Samuel Jones, covering
an estate which was under prior mortgages for twenty-five hundred
dollars, which, with the money of the defendant, Goodwin was to
satisfy; but that he paid but one thousand dollars of the amount, and
fraudulently withheld the balance. And to cover this. fraud, that he
obtained from the recorder of deeds, copies of the prior mortgages
on the estate of Jones, and at the foot of the certificate of the recorder, wrote himself" paid and satisfied ;" and then exhibited the papers
to Jones and the defendant, to show that he had discharged the mortgages. And as there also remained on the estate a prior lien of a

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

judgment for seven hundred dollars, that Goodwin took a bond of
indemnity from Jones against it.
That defendant often solicited Goodwin to deliver up to him the
mortgage, which under variot~s pretexts he declined doing, but assured the defendant that he had discharged the prior mortgages: at
length the defendant becoming uneasy, he called at the recorder's
office, and there found that the mortgage for fifteen hundred dollars had not been discharged; and that the endorsement upon it of
"paid and satisfied," must have been made by Goodwin. On the
same day that the defendant made this discovery, Goodwin informed
him that he was about to stop payment; but he assured the defendant that he should not loge a cent.
Goodwin admitted to the defendant that he had used the money
for his own purposes, instead of paying off the mortgage, and that he
had'deceived both the defendant and Jones. And at the same time,
Goodvin placed a mortgage in the hands of the defendant for twentyfive hundred and seventy-five dollars, to secure him against the
mortgage on the property of Jones. which should have been discharged. That Goodwin assured him the property mortgaged was
unincumbered, which was untrue; and the defendant reproached
Goodwin with having again deceived him, and threatened him with
an exposure, unless he should make payment or give security. Goodwin replied, "what can you do? if you push me I will take the
benefit of the insolvent law;" the defendant rejoined, "have you forgotten the certificate which you forged? Aly attorney informs me,
that if Mr. Jones, or myself, shall come into court with that certificate, that you would be sentenced to hard labour." Goodwin became
alarmed, and stated, that he would sell the property and make good
the deficiency, if the defendant would not expose him.
This conversation took place in the presence of Blrs. Goodwin,
who, when the defendant was leaving the house, accompanied him
to the.door, appealed to his friendship for her, entreated him not to
expose the transaction, declared that she would not have it known,
especially in the church, and among the congregation at Blockley,
foi'-any consideration whatever. She added, that Mr. Goodwin
would sell the property, and make provision for the payment, and
that she would make up the deficiency out of her separate estate; and
that neither the defendant nor his child, whose deceased mother she
greatly esteemed, should lose any thing.
A few days after this Mrs. Goodwin saw ihe ceitificate, and

SUPREME COUR!1.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

acknowledged that it was in the hand-writing of her hI.sband; and
she again entreated the defendant not to expose him, and said she
would pay him if. her husband did not. This assurance was frequently repeated on various occasions, up to the death of Goodwin,
which took place -suddenly in February, 1828. At the moment of
his death, Mrs. Goodwin sent for the defendant, desired him to
superintend the interment, and she threw herself upon his kindness
for consolation. After the interment, the defendant spent the evening with Mrs. Goodwin, engaged in religious conversation; and
being about to leave, she said, Mr. Ashton, I hope you will not forsake me. If you cannot come in the day time, come in the evening,
and pray with me. I will be pleased to see you at any time, and as
soon as I get a little over my trouble, I will fulfil my promise and
settle with you. The defendant replied, that he hoped she would
not let his concern trouble her at that time; that it gave him not a
moment's uneasiness.
This promise was repeated by Mrs. Goodwin ag;ain and again; and
on one occasion, when the defendant was ill, she expressed uneasiness lest he might die before the matter was arranged. On consulting counsel, she was advised to do nothing with her property for a
year, and he refused to draw adeed. But she said the advice was
unjust, that she would pay the defendant, and felt herself bound to
do so as a christian. And she delivered a covenant to the defendant, binding herself to make good the deficiency, should there be one
on the sale of her husband's estate. Up to this time, the defendant
had not expressed a desire to Mrs. Goodwin that she should pay any
part of her husband's debt.
I In December eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, the
defendant
stated, to Mrs. Goodwin that she had acted voluntarily in the matter
and not through his persuasion. That if he might be permitted, for the
first time, to become active in the business, he would suggest, that as
her property was held in trust, the covenant which she had executed
to him was not valid. She expressed surprise, and a willingness to
secure him ; and the bond and mortgage in controversy were prepared and executed at the office of Thomas Mitchell, a scrivener.
.n agreement was executed by the defendant, declaring that the
bond and mortgage were given as collateral security, &c.
With the exception of the execution of the bond and mortgage,
the defendant denied all the ma'erial allegations of the bill.

JANUARY TERM. 1837
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

The other facts are stated in the- opinion of the Court; and by the
counsel, in the argument
The case was argued by Mr. Key, for the appellants; and by Mr.
Ingersoll, for the appellee.
Mr. Key, for the appellants, contended:1. There was no consideration for the bond or mortgage.
2. That they were executed by a weak woman, who, at the time1
was incapable of making such a contract.
3. That they were extorted by a threat to prosecute her husband.
4. That the relation in which the defendant stood to Mrs. Goodwin, as her pastor and religious visiter, and as agent and adviser in
her affairs, prohibited any contract with her; especially when made
in the absence of her counsel, and with his known disapprobation.
Mr. Key, in opening the case, represented the contract which gave
rise to this controversy as having a remarkable origin, and-followed
by very singular circumstances.
The origin, as exhibited by defendant in his answer, and the proofs,
was this: he had been defrauded by Mr. Goodwin; the fraud, as defendant thought, was accompanied bytorgery, and he goes to Goodwin,
and finds him at his house, and in the presence of his wife charges
him with the fraud, and threatens him with a prosecution for forgery:
he says he has taken counsel, and that he has a paper, which he is
advised, proves the forgery, and would send Goodwin to hard labour.
Goodwin is alarmed; begs him to keep the matter secret; and promises to pay or secure him.
On leaving the room, Mrs. Goodwin follows him: the defendant was
a clergyman, Mrs. Goodwin was a pious woman, of the same church,
and had been a communicant in defendant's congregation. She begs
the defendant "not to expose the transaction," saying "she would
not have it known, especially in the church and among the congregdtion at Blockley, for any consideration whatever:" and she added,
that Mr. Goodwin would sell the property and pay it, and "she
would make up the deficiency out of her separate estate." After a
few days she called on defendant, and asked to see the certificate,
which defendant had charged to be a forgery: it was shown to her,
and she observed "it was her husband's hand-writing; and again entreated the defendant not to expose it, and said that she wovld pay
VOL. XI.-2 G

SUPREMIE COURT
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

him if her husband did not:" this was in 1824: Goodwin died suddenly inFebruary, 1828. The answer says, "the defendant continued to rest upon the assurances which had been so often given to
him, by both the husband and wife; and especially upon the good
faith of the latter, in which he placed great reliance after the repeated solemn voluntary promises which she had made to him; which
he believed she had both the inclination and ability to make good."
At the death of her husband, Mrs. Goodwin "sent for defendant,"
"asked his friendly assistance, and threw herself upon him for consolation; and the defendant passed the evening at her house in religious conversation." He continued to visit her till he was taken sick.
She then went to see him, and on her second visit said, "she came
to fulfil her promise by offering him further security; that she would
deed him the house in Lombard street, to hold as collateral security
till Mr. Goodwin's property was sold:" the defendant expressed
himself satisfied with whatever she thought right. Goodwih (it
should be observed) in his life time, had given the defendant some
property as security; and the defendant himself, as he himself stated,
only thought himself unsecured to the amount of 500 or 600 dollars.
The conversation ended by her assuring the defendant, that "slhe
would call on Mr. Ingraham, her attorney, to draw the deed, and
bring it as soon: as it was ready." A few days afterwards she called
again, and said "she had called on Mr. Ingraham agreeably to her
promise, but he refused to draw the deed; stating it would be wrong
for her to pay any of her husband's debts; and that she must do
trothing with her property any way for a yeai." "She added, that
the advice of Mr. Ingraham was very unjust, that it did not move
her in the least from her intention to pay all Mr. Goodwin's friends
to whom he was indebted, and that she felt bound in conscience as a
christian to do so." She therefore delivered to the defendant a
covenant, whereby she agreed to make good the deficiency, should
there be one after the sale of her husband's property, in the payment of the defendant's claim of 2,575 dollars, with the interest due
thereon. This covenant bears date July 17th, 1828.
After this, the answer stated, about the 31st of December, 1828,
the defendant informed her this covenant did not bind her property,
as"it was held by trustees.. She expressed her surprise, and said she
had executed a mortgage to the Bank, and "would execute a similar
one in favour of the defendant." "A mortgage was accordingly
prepared and executed by herself and Kenneth Jewell, her trustee,

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

[Jackson v. Ashton.]

with a bond conditioned to pay 3,000 dollars to defendant, and a
warrant of atforney t) confess judgment; all dated on the 5th of
January, 1929. A defeazance was drawn at the same time, to be
signed by defendant; showing the true consideration of the mortgage
was not the bond, but to pay the deficiency of defendant's debt from
Thomas Goodwin, after applying thd proceeds of Goodwin's property
to that object. This defeazance was never, in point of fact, delivered
to Mrs. Goodwin or her trustee. The scrivener did not knoiv when
it wag executed. Defendant was to come back and execute it; it was
then to be sent to Kenneth Jewell by the scrivener. 'This never
was done; and there was never any other delivery of it than leaving
it with the scrivener, when it was signed. Nor. was it ever aTterwards produced till after this suit was brought, when it was produced by defendant, who was said to have borrowed it. It appears,
by the evidence of B. G. Mitchell, that neither, he, nor his father,
nor the defendant, about a year before, the suit was brought, knew
where it was; and that it was then said defendant had borrowed it.
The mortgage is not only for the house in Lombard street, but for
two others; and, as far as the case shows, for all her property.' This is
the bond and mortgage, which the defendant now asserts the right to
establish; in opposition to the hill filed in the court below, by the representatives ofMrs. Goodwin, to set them aside as made without consideration, as being obtained from a weak woman "utterly incapable
at the time of execution, from her state of health and mind, of understanding or comprehending the meaning of the same;" and, in favour of a person "who, having gained her confidence, prevailed upon
her, in the absence of any friend or legal adviser, to-execute to him
the said bond and mortgage, and to direct her trustee to join in the
execution, representing to her, as a clergyman, that she ought to do
so: which said representation, she being of a devout disposition and
religious inclination of mind, had in her then state of health and
mind great influence upon her." He contended, that from the bill,
answer and proof, it appeared,
1st. That there was no consideration, or an illegal consideration
for this bond and mortgage.
The answer represented the covenant of July as the consideration
for the bond and mortgage; and the previous parol promise of Mrs.
Goodwin, in the life of her husband, as the consideration for the covenant. But if that previous parol promise was without consideration,
(aR it clearly was,) then the giving the covenant, and, subsequently,

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

the mortgage, under the influence of the previous promise, and the
impression that it was obligatory, is no confirmation. Under this
head, he cited 3 Bos. and Pul. 249;, 7 Cowen, 57; 2 Bro. Ch. Rep.
400; 3 Bro. C. R. 117; 2 Vern. 121.

He further contended, under this proposition, that-an illegal consideration appeared, and was, of itself, alone, conclusive against the
validity of the contract; the original consideration, which tainted all
the subsequent contracts, was the suppression of a prosecution. This
is shown by the answer and by the testimony of Dodge; who states
that the defendant told him "the consideration related to unfair con,uct-the forging of a crtificate from the recorder's office; and he
was to let the matter rest, and not to prosecute, if she would pay."
In the defendant's proof, a similar statement is shown to have been
made by Mrs. Goodwin.
That such a consideration vitiated the contract, he cited Brooke
v. Marbury, 7 Wheat. 575; 3 P. Wins. 279; Powell on Contracts,
354, 5, 6.

It is said there was here no forgery in fact; and that therefore,
,there could be no prosecution. Powell on Contracts, 356, shows that
if there was any colour for the charge, it is enough: that it is not
necessary the crime should appear to have been committed.
And if, again, it is said that complainants are not entitled to relief,
if compounding the felony was the consideration, being in pari delicto; he answered that that principle, and all the cases cited in support of it, only applied where the party himself who had assented to
the contract, came to a court of equity for relief: the representatives
of such a party, were not in pari delicto, and not liable to the objection; this distinction was taken, and relief allowed to the represen.
tatives in Matthew and Hanbury, 2 Vern. 187; and the same case
also answers the objection, that the bill does Dot change the illegal
consideration, or the fraud; 9 Pick. R. 212; 3 Cow. 538.
If, then, there was nothing more in the case, this illegal considera-.
tion being fully proved by the defendant himself in his own evidence,
and admitted by his own statement of the consideration to Mr.
Dodge; vitiates these securities.
2d. He next contended, that these instruments were obtained from
a weak woman, incapable at the time of making such a contrast; and
artfully extorted from her by exciting her fears for her husband.
He compared the testimony of complainants and defendant as to
her state of mind and body, when thesa contracts were made; and

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

237

[Jackson v. Ashton.]

contended, that the weight of evidence was against her competency:
the contracts she did make at that time, were all made with the approbation of her legal advisers; and three of these witnesses say they
would not have made a contract with her otherwise.
Further, the complainants' witnesses 'are her intimate acquaintances, and on most familiar and confidential terms of intimacy; and
those of the defendant had but a slight acquaintance with her.
The defendant, on the contrary, is shown by all these transactions
to have been a shrewd man.
He gets security for 3000 dollars, to save him from a probable loss
of 500 or 600 dollars; is to give a defeasance, which she never gets;
which he borrows, and nobody knows where it is, till its production
is necessary for him.
She offers one house, he gets three; and apparently all the propefty
she had.
He does not move in the business during her husband's life, because he feared he would not have suffered his wife to be so imposed on. When she complains of the transaction, he 4uiets her by
promising to wait for his money till after her death. And above
all, by his art in making his threat of prosecution in her presence,
knowing her affection for her husband would prompt her by securing him, to prevent the prosecution.
Such a contract, he contended, could not be sustained between any
persons: but here:
3. The relation subsisting between the parties, the defendant being
her pastor and religious visiter; on ,iiom, as he himself states, " she
liad thrown herself for consolation;" and being, further, her agent
and adviser, in attending to her property and managing her affairs,
as the proof shows; gives to the contract a character which a court
of equity, on principles of public policy, riust condemn. The relation being proved, the presumption of -the undue and irresistible influence of such a relation is enough for the complainants.
Under this head he cited, 12 Ves. 371, in which the Lord Chancellor says, " without any consideration of fraud, or looking beyond
the relation of the parties, the contract is void." Also 2 Jacob and
Walk. 413; where the absence of the legal adviser in a bargain
made between'such parties, is considered an objection.
Here there was not only the absence of the legal adviser, but his
decided advice against the contract, and his refusal to assist in it; and

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

that advice and refusal known to the defendant. Cited 2 Scho. and
Lefroy, 31; 3 P. WVms. 130; MAilue and Keene, 271; 14 Vesey,
273; 3 Mad. Griffith and Robins, 105; 1 Ves. 503; 1 Cox, 112;
1 Ho. 146; 8 Price, 161; 16 Ves: 107; 2 Eden, 290; 5 Pothier,
572, 432; 1 Jon. Ch. R. 350.
The defendant has thought himself safe, because he presumed
the complainants could not prove that he used the influence this relation gave him in gaining his object. But these cases show that the
complainants need not prove it. The whole burden of proof is on
him. He -must show, that it was a fair and reasonable contract, for
a woman in distressed circumstances to make; that she made it with
full knowledge, and freely, and with the advice of competent friends
or counsel.
He has shown nothing of this. It was most unreasonable to strip
herself of her property, for no benefit. She was most cruelly tortured; and her fears, not her free will, gave the promise; and she
had the approbation of no friends, for she did not consult her trustee, who disapproved of it; and if consulted either by her or the defendant, would have prevented it: and her counsel had refused tc.
draw the instrument, and the defendant knew of his refusal. It is
to be hoped that the high sanction of this Court will never be given
to such a contract; which is a temptation thrown in the way of the
ministers of religion, which they may not always be a*ble to resist.
This most important and solemn relation that can subsist between
individuals, ought, above all others, to be guarded, even from the
possibility of abuse; and hallowed by the most exalted purity.
Mr. Ingersoll for the defendant.
The case of the appellee, as it stands without dispute or contrariety
of testimony, exhibits strong claims for the consideration of a court
of equity. A gentleman was defrauded of a considerable sum of
money in the course of arrangements for a mere investment, from
which he could not possibly have gained a farthing; and could not,
in the ordinary and even cautious estimate of results, have anticipated
a loss. The broker in whose hands he regularly places his funds in
mere and necessary deposite, fails to procure the promised security;
and the funds are dishonestly withdrawn from the use of their lawful
owner. This state of things continues unchanged, during the joint
lives of the parties to the transaction., One of them is a perfectly

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

fair and honest sufferer; without being subject to the slightest imputation of misconduct or even indiscretion. The other is a gainer
precisely to the extent of the impropriety of his conduct; and lives
and dies in the enjoyment of his ill-gotten gains.
After the death of the fraudulent party, his wife executes an instrument, calculated merely to indemnify the party wronged. In
doing so, she interferes with no just demand upon herself or her
buried husband. She deprives no credifor of his claim. She does
not even take from child or relative, a portion needed for education
or support. She does an act which comes as near to tlhe performance of an absolute duty, and a compliance with the exactions of positive right, as can be conceived; without a positive provision for it in
the municipal code. It is an act which, in effect, some systems of
legislation have enjoined; which in the"code of morals comes within
a cardinal regulation; and which, in practice, is an honourable -and
not an unfrequent exhibition. Montesquieu highly commends a law
of Geneva, which denies to the children of an insolvent parent the
enjoyment of office, until they have paid his debts.
Mrs. Goodwin herself did the like with other creditors of her
husband, without any complaint on the part of her devisees.
The case thus presented, is'one of those correct and even laudable
transactions to which popular sentiment does h 6 mage, as to a useful.
example: and to which courts of justice will lend their aid as directly
within the just promotion of the purposes of all law, the good conduct and the happiness of those who live under it.
The complainants must go far out of the case in order to succeed.
They.must show something stronger than a contract, to destroy such
an arrangement, as is stated to exist. It is within the limits of
legal possibility to do so. A contract, however clearly made, is liable to be overturned, if it be found wanting in the necessary legal ingredients which must contribute to sustain it.
The complainants assume this burthen of disproof. Fraud will
vitiate any contract, unless it be mutual fraud. The pleadings neither
allege the existence of fraud, nor the existence of the relation of pastor and member of a flock, from which it is argued that influence
was fraudulently exercised. Such allegation is required, according
to the best authorities. Flint v. Field, -2 Anstruther, 543; Gordon
v. Gordon, 3 Swanston, 472i Gouverneur v. Elmendorf, 5 Johns,
ch. 79; E. I. Company v. Henchman, .1 Ves. jr. 289; Handy v.
Handy, 11 Wheat. 103.

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

This want of allegation is relied upon no further than to the extent
of its preventing a suitable denial in the answer; and thus exposing
the case to the uncertainties which arise from conflicting assertions in
argument. Every allegation in the bill, which is material, is denied;
and not one is sustained by testimony, to the disproof of the assertions in the answer. The bill relies upon the following positions;
all of which are denied.
1. That the complainant, Jackson, in the summer of 1819, discovered the mortgage recorded, and called on the defendant to know
how the debt was contracted, &c.
2. Thafthe defendant urged Mrs. Goodwin, shortly after her hlisband's death, to execute a mortgage.
3. That she refused to do- so; and that such refusal was by the
advice of counsel.
4. That to avoid his importunities, she refused to receive his visits, or to see him.
5. That in December, 1828, (before the mortgage was executed,)
she was taken ill.
6. That after her being taken ill, in December, defendant renewed
his visits; took upon himself the management of her affairs; and
having gained her confidence,-and represented to her, as a clergyman, that she ought to execute the mortgage, prevailed on her to do
so in the absence of any friend or legal adviser.
7. That she was utterly incapable of "understandin g or comprehending" the meaning of the mortgage,
These assertions are made by one who does not pretend to know
the truth of them, or to assert any thing of his own knowledge. He
is irresponsible, because he is uninformed. They are unfounded in
proof. They are all contradicted by the answer, in terms which are
unmeasured and unequivocal. They are all, as far as negative proofs
can go, contradicted by other testimony. They remain, therefore,
assertions, only; ineffective words.
We deny that any'relationship subsisted, which justifies the imputation of undue influence. Mr. Ashton -was a clergyman, and Mrs.
Goodman was a religious woman; that is all that existed, and it is all
that is alleged. There are relations which induce a high degree of
confidence on the one side, and influence upon the other. They are
stated in 1 Story's Equity, 306, &c. Wherever they exist, all arrangements between the parties are narrowly observed. It is equally
true as to, quasi,guardians or confidential advisers. But neither these,

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

241

[Jackson v. Ashton.]

nor the positive relations between trustee and cestui que trust, vitiate
necessarily a contract. A man cannot buy of, or sell to himself, if
he stands in the double capacity: but a trustee may, anrd often does
purchase of his cestui que trust. Coles v. Trecothick, 9 Ves. 246;
cites Fox v. Mackreth, 2 Br. C. C. 400; Morsen v. Royal, 12 Ves.
355; Whicheote v. Lawrence, 8 Ves. 740; Lessee of Lazarus v.
Bryson, 3 Binney, 63; Wormley v. Wormley, 8 Wheat. 471.
The doctrine of the complainants, would vitiate every contract
between a pastor and the members of his congregation. He would
become civiliter mortuus, and perhaps starve. No gift can be
accepted, no purchase made from those who are about him; .and the
consequence would be, a condition of absolute seclusion and nonintercourse with his fellow-men.
The charge of imbecility of mind, is positively denied. It is denied in all its stages and degrees. It is repelled throughout. Mrs.
Goodwin was not only not a woman "utterly incapable of understanding and compreiending what she did;" but she was a womav
of strong, active, vigorous, and acute intellect. The idea of insanity
is more than absurd; although it is suggested by one, at least, of the
witnesses for the complainants. The act itself, conducted with infinite prudence and care in all its stages, proves her strength of mind
and firmness of purpose. It was a fortnight or three, weeks in progress. It was conducted with great correctness and propriety; with
no undue haste, and no sort of surprise or irregularity. Much importance is always attached to the manner of conducting the very
thing which is sought to be avoided by, reason of alleged imbecility
of mind. Cartwright v. Cartwright, 1 Ecc. Rep. 51. During her
lifetime, not a suggestion was made of the invalidity of the act, or her
incapacity to perform it. The complainant himself, her agent in
business, as well as her successor in interest, and guardian by affinity,
knew of the mortgage, and of the determination of the defendant to
pursue it; of his refusal to compromise; and of his 9tern demand of
the uttermost farthing as a clear right. Yet he permits it to pass.
So does she. She does more. She confirms it, in the belief which
has been verified, that it would not be eiforced during her life. All
this omission to objeet in due and proper season, was the result of a
conviction, that the presence of Mrs. Goodwin would have put down,
at once, an attempt to avoid the mortgage. She never denied or
doubted it. Her whole life was its confirmation; and she would

It has been argued by counsel, although not. suggested in the
pleadings, that the mortgage is void; because -in furtherance of an
attempt to compound a prosecution for a crime. We deny that any
such arrangement was at any time made. The cases Which have
been decided on the subject of agreements, contrary to the policy of
the law, do not apply to this. Leading ones are to be found, 2 Wils.

Hardacre, I Camp. 45; Brett v. Close; 16 East, 298.
No forgery in fact had been committed. There was a gross fraud;
and Mrs. Goodwin anxiously desired that it should not be made public. That end was gained by the forbearance to sue during her husband's life. After his death the fears of a prosecution were over.
There was none to be dre-qded, and none to be stifled. All that she
did was purely voluntary. If she made any engagements before, (she
being a married woman,) they were legally Ron entities. 1 Sid. 120;

Were it otherwise, the case of the complainant would not be aided.
A mutual agreement to violate the law, will not justify the application of either party to a court of justice for relief. This is not our
attempt to enforce the mortgage. It is the attempt of the complainants to have it delivered up to be cancelled. If their views are cor-

rect as to the nature of the contract, neither party can succeed. The

bill like this, is well understood. Smyth -.- Smyth, 2, Mad. 387;

We know nothing of the source from which the trust estate of
Mrs. Goodwin was derived. If from her husband, it is a fund peculiarly appropriate for the payment of this debt; and it is fraud to
withhold it. Inducements stronger even than those of honest pride
and affection, may have led her to provide this security. Under the
consciousness, if it existed, that she held property which belonged to
her husband; it was the simple dictate of moral honesty, to yield it to
so sacred a claim as that of the defendant. With or without the
motive, she was sensible that the money of which the defendant had
been spoiled, belonged to the child of a deceAsed friend; and she
therefore anxiously and naturally sought to secure its restoration.
Much has been said of the extent of pecuniary effort which Mrs.
Goodwin's estate must make, to meet this engagement. It is supposed that all her property was pledged for the purpose; and more
than once, she is declared to have stripped and beggared herself, to
meet the object. It is easy to show how erroneous is this presumption; and hence to defeat the argument drawn from the supposed unreasonable character of the sacrifice, and the appeal which it involves
to our feelings of kindness for her descendants.
1. The mortgage contains only three small lots in the city of Philadelphia, and it is in evidence that she had property in the country;
especially the seat where she was visitec. by Dr. Beatty, during one
of her attacks of indisposition.
2. The bill states, that Mrs. Goodwin's will devises, among other
things, the mortgaged premises. The general character of the will
does not enable us to judge of the comparative value of the property
mortgaged, and that which was left free from liability.

Something has been said with regard to the possession of the defeasance by the defendant. It warted explanation, in'proof, before
the circuit court. But it is now fully explained by the testimony of
Daniel R. Ashton; who states that it was borrowed of the scrivener
for the purpose of preparing the answer. It had remained in the
hands of the scrivener, in consequence of the inadvertent omission
of Mrs. Goodwin's trustee to call and receive it. Besides, there is
nothing in the bill in relation to it: if there had been, it would have
enabled the defendant himself fully to account for whatever there is
supposed to be of mystery. It was executed in perfect good faith
'and form. It was left with the scrivener according to agreement,
and it was so left for the proper party, (the trustee,) and it remained
subject to his call. A failure of memory in the scrivenery who did
not chance to recollect how it passed out of his hands; or a little neglect in the trustee to call for it in season; cannot surely ipvolve a
case in jeopardy, or a party in so grave a charge as that of withholdmg a document necessary for the protection of the complainants
against absolute liability. The. defendant never alleged that the
mortgage was other than collateral.
Mr. Justice M'LEA delivered the opinion of the Court.
This suit in chancery is brought before this Court, by an appeal
from the decree of the circuit court of Pennsylvania.,
The appellants, who are the devisecs of Maria Goodwin, brought
their bill to set aside a bond and mortgage executed by Maria Coodwin, and her trustee, Kenneth Jewell, to the defendant, on the 5th

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

of January, 1829, to secure the payment of 3000 dollars. The bill
represents that the mortgage was given without consideration ; that
shortly after the decease of Thomas Goodwin, the husband of Mrs.
Goodwin, which took place in February, 1828, the defendart stated
to her that he had a demand against her husband, to whom she hal
been much attached, and.who had treated him extremely ill; that le
had it in his power to render his memory odious, by exposing ljs
conduct; but that he would conceal the transaction, if she would e~ecute a mortgage to him on her own property, to secure the delt: t it
she refused to execute the mortgage, or give any other security, )y
the advice of her counsel; and afterwards avoided his visits to get
clear of his importunities: that shortly after this Mrs. Goodivin vas
taken ill, and being executrix, her husband's affairs prissed mrech
upon her, and she fell into a low nervous state of spirit- which impaired her memory and affected her mind; that whilst she was in
this state, the defendant renewed his visits, and profissing great
kindness for her, took upon himself the management of ier business;
and, having gained her confidence, prevailed upon he, in the absence of any friend or legal adviser, to execute the mcrtgage, *and a
corresponding bond; and to direct that her trustee mould join n
the execution; the defendant, as a clergyman, saying she ought to do
so: that these representations had great influence on Mrs. Goodwin,
who was a woman of devout religious feelings.
The complainants further represent, that at the time the bond and
mortgage were executed, Mrs. Goodwin was ulterly incapable of
understanding or comprehending their meaning and effect; that after
the death of Mrs. Goodwin, the defendant stated to the complainants, that the mortgage was executed as collat.ral security for any
sum that might be due to him from the estate ol Thomas Goodwin,
deceased.
In his answer, the defendant admits the execufon of the bond and
mortgage, and states, that in 1822, being about to receive a sum of
money, he consulted Thomas Goodwin, who was then a broker in
Philadelphia, in what way he could most advantageously invest it;
that Goodwin advised him to leave the money in his hands, and that
he would loan it out on good security. That the defendant, in pursuance of this advice, placed 3400 dollars in his hands; and also
loaned him 275 dollars, and took his notes by way of acknowledgment.
That Goodwin received a bond and mortgage for 2600 dollars, in

SUPREME COURT.
(Jackson v. Ashton.]

favour of defendant, from Samuel Jones, covering an estate which
was under prior mortgages, for 2500 dollars, which, with the money
of the defendant, Goodwin was to satisfy; but that he paid but 1000
d-)lars of the amount, and fraudulently withheld the balance. And to
cover this fraud, that he obtained from the recorder of deeds, copies
ofth'e prior mortgages on the estate of Jones; and at the foot of the
ca-tificate of the recorder, wrote himself "paid and satisfied ;" and
thn exhibited the papers to Jones and the defendant, to show that he
hal discharged the mortgages. And as there also remained on the
esiate a prior lien of a judgment for 700 dollars, that Goodwin took
a Iond of indemnity from Jones against it.
That defendant often' solicited Goodwin to deliver up to him the
mo tgage, vhich under various pretexts he declined doing; but assured the dtfendant that he had discharged the prior mortgages: at
length'the lefendant becoming uneasy, he called at the recorder's
office, and here found that the mortgage for 1500 dollars had not
been disehamed, and that the endorsement upon it of "paid and
satisfied," mist have been made by Goodwin. On the same day that
the defendam made this discovery, Goodwin informed him that he
was about to stop payment ; but he assured the defendant that he
should not lose at .ent.
Goodwin admitted to the defendant that he had used the mdney
for his own purposes, instead of paying off the mortgage; and that he
had deceived both the defendant and Jones. And at the same time,
Goodwin placed .mortgage in the hands of the defendant for 2575
dollars, to secure tin: against the mortgage on the property of Jones,
which should have bten discharged. That Goodwin assured him the
property mortgaged ,as unincumbered, which was untrue; and the
defendant reproachel Goodwin with having again deceived him, and
threatened him witl an exposure, unless he should make payment or
give security. Gocdwin replied,." what can you do? if you push me,
I will take the benefit of the' insolvent law;" the defendant rejoined,
"have you forgotten the certificate which you forged? My attorney
informs me, that if Mr.Jones, or mysclf, shall come into court with
that certificate, that you would be in danger of being sentenced to
hard labour."
Goodwin became alarmed, and stated, that he would
sell the property and make good the deficiency, if the defendant
would not expose him.
This conversation took place in the presence of I'Irs. Goodwin;
who, when the defendant was leaving the house, accompanied him

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

Lo the door, appealed to his friendship for her, entreated him not to
expose the transaction, declared that she would not have it known,
especially ii the church, and among the congregation at Blockley,
for any consideration whatever. She added, that Mr. Goodwin
would sell the property, and make provision for the payment; and
that she would make up the deficiency out of her separate estate;
and neither the defendant nor his child, whose deceased mother she
greatly esteemed, should lose any thing.
A few days after this Mrs. Goodwin saw the certificate, and
acknowledged that it was in the hand-writing of her husband; and
she again entreated the defendant not to expose him, and said she
would pay him if her husband did not. This assurance was frequently repeated on various occasions up to the death of Goodwin;
which took place, suddenly, in February, 1S28. At the moment of
his death, Mrs. Goodwin sent for the defendant, desired him to superintend the interment, and she threw herself upon his kindness for
consolation. After the interment, the defcndant spent the -evening
with Mrs. Goodwin, engaged in religious conversation; and being
about to leave, she said, Mr. Ashton, I hope you will not forsake me.
If you cannot come in the day time, come in. the evening, and pray
with me. i will be pleased to see you at any time; and as soon as I
get a little over my trouble I will fulfil my promise and settle with
y9u. The defendant replied, that he hoped she would not let his
concern trouble her at that time; that it gave him not a moment's
uneasiness.
This promise was repeated by Mrs. Goodwiii again and again, and
on one occasion, when the defendant was ill, she expressed uneasiness lest he might die before the matter was arranged. On consulting counsel, she was advised to do nothing with her property for a
year, and he refused to draw a deed. But she said the advice was
unjust, that she would pay the defendant, ant felt herself bound to
do so as-a christian. And she delivered a covenant to the defendant,
binding herself to make good the deficiency, should there be one, on
the sale of her husband's estate. Up to this time, the defendant had
not expressed a desire to Mrs. Gdodwin that she should pay any part
of her husband's (lebt

business, he would suggest, that av her property was held in trust.

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

the covenant which she had executed to him was not valid. She
expressed surprise, and a willingness to secure him; and the bond and
mortgage in controversy were prepared and executed at the office of
Thomas Mitchell, a scrivener. An agreement was executed by the
defendant, declaring that the bond and mortgage were given as collateral security, &c.
With the exception of the execution of the bond and mortgage,
the defendant denies all the material allegations of the bill.
The counsel for the complainants contend, that the proof sustains
the charges in the bill; and that they are entitled to the relief prayed
for, on the following grounds:
1. That there was no consideration for the bond and mortgage.
2. That they were executed by a weak woman; who, at the time,
was incapable of making such a contract.
3. That they were extorted by a threat.to prose 2ute her husband.
4. That the relation -in which the defendant stood to her, as her
pastor and religious visiter, and as agent and adviser in her affairs,
prohibited any contract wtth her; especially when mad in the absence of her counsel and with his known disapprobation.
As to the want of consideration alleged in the first position, it
must be observed, that this is not an application to the Court for
the specific execution of a contract; but to set one aside which is
clothed with the highest solemnities known to the law. A contract
under the hand and seal of the party; duly acktnowledged, and placed
upon the public records. This deed "purports upon its face a consideration, whether it be considered at law or equity.
A court of chancery will often refuse to enforce a contrazt, specifically, when it would also refuse to annul it. In such a case, the
parties are left to their remedy at law.
In the present case, as the deed purports a consideration, it is
unnecessary for the defendant to prove one; and the deed is not
vitiated, if the complainrants show that it was given without a valuable consideration; unless there be connected with the transaction,
mistake, deception, incapacity or fraud. The mortgage deed is impeached by the counsel on several of these grounds; all of which
will be considered under the appropriate head s.
The second position assumed, is a want of capacity in Mrs. Goodwin to make a contract at the time the deed was executed.
This is the principal ground stated in the bill, and it covers a great
portion of the evidence in the case. -It is intimately connected with

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

the third position assumed, that the deed was extorted from Mrs.
Goodwin by thfeats to prosecute her husband; and they w;ll both be
considered as one proposition.
Was Mrs. Goodwin of sound and disposing mind, at the time the
mortgage deed was executed ? Did she act freely and voluntarily?
The answer of the defendant is broader than the allegations in the
bill, and although such parts of the answer as are not responsive to
the bill, are not evidence for the defendant; yet the counsel on both
sides have considered the facts disclosed, as belonging to the case.
And, if the facts in the answer, not responsive to the bill;are relied
on by the complainant's counsel as admissions by the defendant; lbe
is entitled, thus far, to their full benefit.
It may be proper also to observe, that no admissions in an answer,
can, under any circumstaices, lay the -foundation fo..relief under any
specific head of equity, unless it be substantially set forth in the bill.
Several years ago, it geems, the defendant being a clergyman of
the Baptist denomination, had the charge of a congregation at Blockley, in or near to Philadelphia; and Mr. and TM
rs. Goodwin were
mhembers of that church. But some time before the deed was executed, they removed from the limits of that congregation and resided
in another.
From the business of Goodwin, he being a broker, and the connection which existed between him and the defendant, it was natural
that the defendant should consult him, as tothe investment he was
desirous of making in 1822. And it is not extraordinary that the
defendant should have confided in the integrity of Goodwin. It
seems that this confidence was not easily shaken; for although the
money was placed in his hands for investment, in March, 1S22, yet
the defendant did not discover the fraud of Goodwin, until the last
of January, 1823; and then another fraud was practised by Goodwin, by giving another security of little or no value. It was under
such circumstanc6s, and with a knowledge that Goodwin was about
to stop payment, that the defendant called at his house; charged him
with another deception, and insisted on security or immediate payment. Goodwin threatened him with taking the benefit of the insolvent act; and then the defendant asked him if he had forgottcn
the certificate he had forged, and said if it were brought into court,
he would be in danger of "going to hard labour."
That these were words of heat and passion, is evident. That there
was strong provocation,," equally clear; still it had been better, na1
VOL. XI.-2 I

SUPREME COURT.
_Jdfckson v. Ashton.]

he not uttered them. The high and holy calling of the defendant
should have guarded him against the influence of passion. He
should have remembered that those who are most'sceptical, not unfrequently, make the highest exaction of purity in the station he occupied. But he was a man of like passions with others, and liable
to err.
Did the defendant visit the house of Goodwin with the premeditated design of making this charge, in order to extort from Mrs.
Goodwin a promise to indemnify him? That he did, is most earnestly contended by the counsel for the complainants; and he is
charged with the greatest impropriety in making the charge against
Goodwin in the presence of his wife.
This inference is not authorized by the facts and circumstances of
the case.
As was very natural, Mrs. Goodwin felt great anxiety when she
heard the charge, and was solicitous that her husband should not be
exposed.

She promised to make up any part of the debt to the de-

fendant, which her husband should be unable to pay. This was
about six years before Mrs. Goodwin executed the mortgage deed.
On various occasions, during the lifetime of her husband, she repeated this promise to the defendant, as appears from the evidence,
without his solicitation; and she made similar declaratiois to other
persons.
As might bE expected, the intercourse between the defendant and
the family of Mr. Goodwin was, perhaps, after thi , less frequent
than it had been. On one occasion, however, his good offices were
requested, to prevent the exhibition of the forged words, as evidefice,
in an action of slander brought by Goodwin. ie interposed, but
could not prevent the evidence from being offered.
It does not appear that the defendant threatened to commence a
prosecution against Goodwin, but only saidvhat he was informed
would be the effect of a prosecution. The facts do not justify the
conclusion thnt the defendant agreed to suppress the prosecution, on
consideration of the promise of Mrs. Goodwin. Thai he confided in
her promise is extremely probable, from the fact that he seems to
have made little or no effort froaih this time until the dealh of Goodwin, five years afterwards, to obtain hismoney or additional security.
At length, in February '1S2, Goodwin died very suddenly. In
her distr'ess; Mrs. Goodwin sent fo" the defendant to superintend
the last offices to her departed husband, and to impart to her the con-

JANUARY TERM, 1837.

251

[Jackson v. Ashton.]

solations of religion. This is admitted to afford the highest evidence
of the confidence which she reposed in the friendship and piety of
the defendant.
Did he abuse that confidence? It is- said that he did. That he
seized the .occasion while the heart of Mrs. Goodwin was broken
under the weight of her afflictions, to insinuate himself into her confidence, and acquire an ascendency over her; that he might wring
from her the debt of her husband. And here the eloquence of the
counsel has depicted, in strong colours, the base, hypocritical, and
mercenary spirit of the defendant.
If, indeed, the picture is drawn from the life, and is not the work
of the imagination; it presents human nature in so odious an aspect,
as to create loathing and disgust.
Called to give consolation to a female overwhelmed by the sudden
death of a husband, to whom, with all his imperfections, she was tenderly attached, and that husband lying a corpse in the house, or
just deposited in the grave; can itbe supposed, without the strongest
evidence, that a wretch exists, so lost to all the better feelings of the
heart, as to use such an occasion to extort from the widow the payment of a debt?
Both Mrs. Goodwin aiid the defendant have gone to their last and
solemn. account, and are alike beyond the reach of censure or
praise; but no one could wish the charge against the defendant, in
this respect, to be true. There is nothing in the evidenceto justify
it. He did not name the subject of the debt t6 Mrs. Goodwin, and
when she mentioned it, as he was about taking leave, he begged her
not to give herself any uneasiness on the subject; and it was not until
near a year after this, that the mortgage deed was executed.
Six witnesses were examined by the complainants to show that at
the time Mrs. Goodwin executed the deed, she had not the capacity
to make a contract; and that she laboured under an improper influence exerted by the defendant.
Some of these witnesses resided with Mrs: Goodwin, and they all
speak of her being ill, more or less, at different periods of time; as
well before, as after the decease of her husband. She appears to
have been rather of a dejected and melancholy cast of mind, and was
often in a state of despondency. Some of the witnesses speak of
times when her mind was shattered or impaired, while labouring
under physical debility; and they state certain acts, which they considered as resulting from a mind somewhat insettled and wandering.

252

SUPREME COURT..
[Jackson v Ashton.]

At one time she refused to attend her grand-daughter to church,
who was to be received as a communicant; she declined fafnily worship; would sometimes not answer qqestions; and on returning
from a former country residence, shortly after the death of her husband, she seemed to be agitated, sat down in a chair, and burst into
a flood of tearst She kept a boarding-house some time, and involved
herself in debt. Miss Jackson, who refers to these circumstances,
remarks, that she never knew Mrs. Goodwin to say a foolish thing,
or do a foolish act; and except on the occasions specified, her conduct and conversation were intelligent and rational.
It would seem from the statement of the witnesses, that she was
as subject to depression of spirits before the death of Mr. Goodwin,
as afterwards.
Dr. Beatty attended Mrs. Goodwin, as a physician; first saw her
in Lombard Street, in 1827. She laboured under great mental torpor, but had no serious orfganic disease. During the time she kept a
boarding-house in Twelfth street, she managed her. own concerns;
did the principal work of the house, and often went to market. Mr.
Dodge-states, that after-the death of Mr. Goodwin, she having more
business to transact, was more active than she had been; but in two or
three months she-relapsed into her former-state of mind, and seemed
much depressed on the subject of her business. The witness hardly
thinks she had sufficient capacity to transact any other than the ordinary business of life.
Some of the vitnesses did not think her capable of conducting the
business of a boarding-house; and certain acts of supposed miscalculatibn or extravagance are named.
It seems that the defendant occasionally Zalled to see Mrs. Goodwin, but less frequently than she desired. In July, after the death
of Mr. Goodwin, Miss Long, who lived with Mrs. Goodwin, was
called down stairs to witiess a written paper; and, after signing it,
observed to the defendant that'she did not kfiow what she had signed.
Mrs. Goodwin was present. -The defendant said,'it was a piece of
writing between Mrs: Goodwin and himself. Mrs. Goodwin once
or twice expressed'herself uneasy about the business of the defendant; but there is no evidence that -at any of his visits he importuned
her on the subject of his claim, or that he took any active agency in
the matter until about the time -the mortgage was executed.
The scrivener who drew the bond and mortgage, and whose son
drew the defeasance, states that Mrs. Goodwin, her trustee, and the

JANUARY TERM, 1837.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

defendant, were present when they were signed. Much eonversation was had on the subject of the papers, and Mrs. Goodwin was
very attentive to the business. She did not seem to be labourihg
under any remarkable feebleness of body or mind. ' The mortgage
was intended as collateral security; and the defeasance was drawn on
a separate paper. Since the commencement of the present suit, the
defeasance was handed to the scrivener by the defendant, who'said
he had borrowed it from the office; the paper had not .been called
for by the trustee.
Jewell, the trustee of Mrs. Goodwin, -states that the defendant
and Mrs. Goodwin called on him, and she observed that she wished
to execute a mortgage on her 1iroperty, to secur6 the defendant in a
claim he had on her late husband; and on being asked' if she had
consulted Mr. Ingraham, her counsel, she replied, that she had not,
and*that he had treated her with coolness. She said the mbrfgage
was intefided as collateral security.
Some time after this, Mrs. Goodwin becoming somewhat embarrassed in her circumstances, relinquished her house; and the defendant undertook the settlement of her accounts.
Some ten or twelve witnesses, who were well acquainted with
Mrs. Goodwin, before and after her husband's death, and about the
time the deed was executed; were examined by the defendant to
prove that she was of capacity to contract generally. Some of these
witnesses had business with her, and speak of her acuteness and uncommon smartness. Others say that she was a woman of more than
ordinary intelligence; that on religious subjects she was very well
informed. One of the witnesses speaks of her as a remarkably sensible woman; heard her speak of the defendant as having been injured by her husband, and that it was right he should be made
secure. She spoke of the defendant's kindness in not prosecuting
her husband; and said, as the witness understood, partly for that,
and other acts of kindnesi, the defendant ought to be made secure
from loss.

On a careful examination of the whole evidence, as fo the competency of Mrs. Goodwin to execute the mortgage at the time it'was
given, we are brought to the conclusion, that the ground of incapacity is not sustained. On the day the mortgage was executed, sh&
was at the scrivener's with her trustee and the defendant; and it does
not seem to have occurred, either to' her trustee or the scrivener,
that she was labouring under any incapacity of mind. She took an

SUPREME COURT.
[Jackson v. Ashton.]

active part in the business; understood perfectly the nature of the
writings: and her whole deportment, on that occasion, showed that
she -was capable of acting for herself, in giving the security on her
property.
Prior to this period, Mrs. Goodwin had given to the defendant a
covenant to indemnify him; this was the paper witnessed by Miss
Long, in July, 1828, and which was supposed not to be valid; the
mortgage, was given in lieu or this paper.
Was this mortgage deed executed through any threat by the defendant, to render the charactez of Goodwin infamous? There is not
a shadow of proof to sustain this allegation of the bill, and it is denied by the answer.
The threat must be carried back to the conversation between the
defendant and Goodwin, in the prcsence of his wife, respecting the
forged certificate; and this was about six years before the deed was
executed. And this circumstance is relied on to show that this mortgage was extorted from Mrs. Goodwin.
The forgery, as it was improperly called, had been fully exposed
in the action of slander brought by Goodwin; so that no apprehension, on that score, could have been felt by Mrs. Goodwin. Her
husband lived about five years after the threat; and it appears, if, until
the time of his death he did not continue on terms of particular intimacy with the defendant, there seems to have been no hostility between them. And can it be supposed, that the conversation could
have so operated on the mind of Mrs. Goodwin, six years afterwards,
as to extort from her the deed in question? The facts of the case
authorize no such conclusion.
Did the defendant exercise any influence over the mind of Mrs.
Goodwin, which can affect the contract?
That he relied on the repeated assurances givenby her to indemnify
him'is clear. During the lifetime of her husband he does not appear
to have resorted to any means to compel payment; and, after the death
of Goodwin, he did not obtrude himself into the house of mourning
as a creditor. He was there, but to perform the office of a comforter;
and there is no evidence which shows any improper anxiety on his
part to secure his debt. Until a short time before the execution of
the mortgage deed, so far as the history of the case is known, Mrs.
Goodwin was the first to introduee the subject; and, on one occasion,
expressed no small anxiety to give the indemnity.
It was not until the covenant was found to be invalid that he be-

[Jackson v. Ashton.]
came active in the business; and then, it would seem, that he introduced the subject in the most delicate manner. On being informed
of the invalidity of the covenant, she expressed a perfect willingness
to give the mortgage.
The mortgage does not cover the entire estate of Mrs. Goodwin;
so that, by giving it, she did not strip herself of the means of support.
It seems, that some time after the mortgage was executed, on being
told that the defendant would distress- her, she expressed a determination to dispute the deed; but on being assured by the defendant,
that during her life he should not embarrass her by pressing the
claim, she became perfectly satisfied. This dissatisfaction seems to
have been excited by one of the persons named as complainant
That the defendant should have felt some anxiety to secure the
claim, was very natural. It was money which came into his hand as
the guardian of his child, whose mother was deceased. But there
was no part of the defendant's conduct, either before or after the
death of Goodwin, which shows a disposition to exercise a fraudulent or imprqper influence over Mrs. Qoodwin in this matter. She
acted voluntarily; and, so far as appears in the evidence, free from
any influence that goes to impeach the contract.
In taking the defeasance from the office of the scrivener, the
defendant seems to have had no improper design. He borrowed it
from the clerk in the office; probably, and most likely, forgot to return it. He returned it since the commencement of this suit; which
he would not have done had he taken, the paper with a dishonest or
fraudulent intention.
The motive which led Mrs. Goodwin to give this indemnity, was
highly honourable to her feelings as a wife, a christian and friend.
She had property of her own. She saw that her friend had been injured by the fraudulent conduct of her husband; and, whilt she
threw a mantle over the imperfections of her husband, she endeavoured to repair the injury he had done.
We come now to consider the fourth ground taken by the complainants; which is, that from the relation which existed between the
defendant and Mrs. Goodwin, she could make no valid contract with
him. He was her pastor and agent.
After her embarrassments commenced, at the request of her trustee, the defendant did undertake the settlemend of her aflirs; to
which service he seems to have been prompted by the kindest feelings towards her. We cannot suppose that this agency, which wa,%

in fact undertaken after the mortgage was executed, could vitiate any
contract. About the time the mortgage was executed, and before
that time, he seems to have had no special agency in the business. of
Mrs. Goodwin.
But he is represented to have been her pastor. Some years before
the mortgage deed was signed, Mrs. Goodwin did belong to the
church under the chargeoof the defendant; but this relation had
ceased long before the death of Goodwin: but if this relation existed
in fact, it is not, charged in the bill.
Does the profession of a clergyman subject him to suspicions
which do not attach to other men ? Is he presumed to be dishonest?
It would, indeed, exhibit a most singular spectacle, if this Court by
its decision should fix this stain on the character of a class of Inen,
who are generdlly respected for the purity of their lives, and their
active agency in the cause of virtue. They are influential, it is true;
but their influence depends upon the faithfulness and zeal with
which their sacred duties are performed.
Acquainted as we are with the imperfections of our nature, we
cannot expect to find any class of men exempt from human infirmities. But why should the ministers of thd gospel, who as a class aye
more exemplary in their lives than any other, be unable to make a
contract with those who know them best and love them most.
Their influence, by precept and example, does more to reform the
actions of men, and restrain their vicious inclinations, than all the
institutions of society. And yetwe are called upon to denounce this
whole class, and hold them incapable of making a contract with
those Who are under their pastoral charge, and who, like Mrs. Goodwin, are distinguished for their piety.
Why not give theh the same measure of right which is enjoyed
by others ? If any minister should become a traitor to his master,
.and disgrace his high and holy calling by using, for fraudulent purposes, his influence over the weak or unwary, the law affords a
remedy: and the ]jroceedings in this case show, that the disposition
will not be wanting to bring him to an account.
Upon a deliberate consideration of the facts and circumstances of
this case, we are of the opinion, that the decree of the circuit court
ought to be affirmed, with costs.
