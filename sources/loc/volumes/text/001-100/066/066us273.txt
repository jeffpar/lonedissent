ter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dol:
lars, exclusive of costs." This has always been held to mean
a property value, and without the fact of value being shown
oil the record, or by evidence aliunde, the court has no jurisdiction to heait or re-examine the case. The cases of Weston

vs. The City Council of South Carolina, (2 Peters, 449,) and
Holmes vs. Jennzson, (14 ib., 540,) referred to, were brought
up from State courts under the 25th section of the judiciary
act, in which case no value is required. We do not doubt but
that the order discharging the defendants was a final one, and
that the only objection to the jurisdiction is the one above
stated.

Erroi to the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern district of Ohio.
The plaintiff in error, who was also plaintiff below, filed a
declaration in case against defendants in error, for the infringement of letters patent of the United States, granted to
him November 80, 1852, for an improvement in grain separators. This declaration was filed March 22d, 1859. On the
25th of October following, one of the defendants filed the following plea. "And now comes the said John M. Garr and
says that the said John R. Moffitt ought not further to maintain this action against him, because, he says, that since the
commencement thereof and before the 17th day of May, 1859,

brought, and this he is ready to verify Wherefore," etc. To
this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the court overruled the
demurrer. Judgment for defendant. The plaintiff took this
writ of error.
Mr Lee and 1!-r Fisher, of Ohio, for plauiitiff in error
There may be a surender of letters patent which is not made
for the purpose of reissue under the 13th section of the act of
July 4, 1836. The plea does not aver that the plaintiff's patent
was surrendered under, or by virtue of,the 13th section of the
patent act; nor does it aver that it was surrendered for the purpose of obtaining a reissue, or that it was surrendered because
of a defective or insufficient description or specification, or
because the claim was too broad, or because the patent was
from any cause void or voidable, nor even that the patent
was cancelled.
The question of the right of a patentee to surrender his patent, before the act of 1836, and independently of any statute
authorizing him to do so, was fully considered in the discussion of the case of Grant vs. .aymond, (6 Peters, 218;) but
neither the court, nor either of the distinguished counsel,
seemed to doubt, for a moment, that he possessed such power.
Batten vs. Taggart,(17 How., 74.) If the right to make such a
surrender exists independently of any statute, the making of
the surrender does not imply or involve any statutory or other
defect in the patent. And where a patent has been so surrendered or abandoned, an action may still be maintained for infringements committed before the surrender or abandonment.
If the patentee surrenders his patent at the end of six years, it
is the same as if it had been originally granted to him for six
years, and that, for violations of his exclusive privileges committed during those six years, his remedy is as complete as if
the patent had stood to the end of his term. It would seem
as if this proposition did not admit of doubt or arguraent. If
the surrender of the patent vacates it from the first, then the

275,

Mofftt vs. Garr et at.

patentee has been a trespasser from the beginning. He may
have been the first and original inventor of a useful improvement; his patent may have been regularly issued, it may have
been tested and declared valid in the courts of last resort; and
his right to enjoy his monopoly to the end of the full term
may have been indisputable. Yet, if he surrenders the latter
half of that monopoly to the people, he renders the first half
void. He ought to be compelled to refund every penny he had
received as patentee, whether peaceably or by the judgment
of a competent tribunal. This would be monstrous. But, if
he has any rights under the first half of the grant, he is entitled to full rights. If he is entitled to keep the pay received
from those who have used and paid, he is also entitled to demand and recover his pay from those who have used and not
paid. He might have brought and maintained such aii action
before the surrender. Why not as well afterward, when suits
may be brought any time within six years after the expiration
of a patent for infringements committed before? The right
of the patentee, we insist, is not divisible. That portion of it
which is in possession is no more legal than that which re
mains in action.
The application of these principles to the present case is obvious.
The plea avers a simple surrender of the patent, made two
months after an action had been actually brought to recover
damages for a previous infringement. It does not aver cancellation or reissue. The court, by overruling the demurrer,
held such a plea to be a bar to such an action. We think the
error obvious, upon the principles above set forth.
But if this surrender were, in fact, made under the authority
of the 13th section of the act of July 4, 1836, and only by virtue
of that section, then we maintain A surrender of a. patent for
correction and reissue, by virtue of the statute, does not render
the patent void ab niio. If the patentee still chooses to risk a
suit upon the original patent, he may recover upon it for infringements committed before it was surrendered. In support
of this proposition we submit the considerations just urged.

SUPREME COURT.
Moftitt vs. Garret aL

If the patent is vacated from its issue, then every exercise of
exclusive ownership has been illegal. If not, then infringers
ought, at least, to be compelled to pay that which honest men
have been willing to give the patentee.
This court has, as it seems to us, expressly refused to affirm
the English doctrine, that a surrender and reissue vacated the
original patent. Shaw vs. Cooper, (7 Pet., 314,) Grant vs. Raymond, (6 Pet., 220.) See also Ames vs. Howard, (1 Sumner,
488,) Stanley vs. WhTpple, (2 McLean, 37;) Woodworth vs. Stone,
(3 Story, 753, 754,) Woodworth vs. Hall, (1 Wood & Minot, 257;)
Eastman vs. Bodfish, (1 Story, 529.)
But, again. It is urged, and as the main objection, that, by
the very act of surrender, under the statute, the patentee admits
that his original patent is void, and, therefore, he is estopped
from asserting its validity in a suit for its infringement.
To this we answer, that he makes no such admission, even
by the act of statutory surrender.
The 13th section provides, "thatwhenever any patent which
has heretofore been granted, or which shall hereafter be granted,
shall be inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming in his specification more than he had or shall
have a right to claim as new, if the error, &c."
A patent, then, may be reissued, if it be-st, inoperative; or,
2d, invalid. Looking to what follows, the word "inoperative"
manifestly refers to the defective specification, and the word
"invalid" to the claim of "too much," which, under the act
of 1836, rendered the patent absolutely void.
A patent "inoperative" because of a "defective or insufficient" specification is not necessarily void. The specification
may not describe the invention as clearly as might be desired,
or so comprehensively as to cover a particular evasion of thu
patent, or it may fall short of describing the whole of the invention, illustrated by the model and drawings. In such case,
this court (Batten vs. Taggart, 17 How., 84) held that the patentee had a right "to restrict or enlarge his claim, so as to give
it validity and to effectuate his invention."

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

27

Hofhfit
vs. Garr el al.

But an enlargement of tat, claim is a claim for something
more, and if such a claim be valid, the original claim must be
valid also, for "the greater includes the less."
The history of the litigation upon patents shows that many
patents have been surrendered and reissued after they had
been the subject of fierce contro-ersy, and had repeatedly been
declared valid by the courts of the United States. The validity of the famous Woodworth patent had been established in
Massachusetts and Ohio. See Brooks vs. Bilawell, (3 McLean,
250 ,) Washburnvs. Gould, (3 Story, 122 ,) Woodworth vs. Sherman, (8 Story, 171.) And yet the patent was afterwards reissued. Woodworth vs. Stone, (3 Story, 751,) Woodworth vs. Edwards, (3 Wood & Minot, 136 et seq.)
So also with the Howe Sewing Machine patent.
The plea having averred surrender only, but not cancellation, the court could not know judicially but that the original
patent was still in existence. The acts of surrender and cancellation are distinct, and are so recognised by the court in
the case of Batten vs. Taggart, (17 How., 80.)
Mr Stanbery, of Ohio, for defendant in error. I will
c)nslder, in their order, the grounds for reversal relied on by
the plaintiff.
1. "That there may be a surrender of letters patent, which
is not made for the purpose of reissue, under the 13th section
of the act of July 4, 1836."
It does not seem of any moment to consider whether there
may not be a surrender, under that 13th section, without a reissue, for if such surrender is allowable, as the pla'intiff
alleges, still it is a surrender under-that section, and the question remains, as to the effect of the surrender.
The plaintiff argues, that there may be a surrender independently of the statute, and that such a surrender would not nenessarily imply that the patent was invalid. In support of
this position, G-rant vs. Raymond (6 Peters, 218) is cited.
No such question arose in that case, for the surrender in that
case was in virtue of the statute then in force. The real question was as to the new patent issued after the surrender; for

SUPREME COURT.
.Aoffitt vs. Garr et al.

the statute then in force only provided for a surrender, and
did not expressly authorize the reissue.
I find it difficult to understand what the plaintiff means by
a surrender of a patent, independent of the statute. A patentee may, herhaps, (though it is by no means clear,) destroy
his patent by cancellation. That is his own act, but he cannot surrender his patent to himself. The act implies a party
capable of receiving the surrender.
Now, what is alleged in our plea is a surrender to the United
States-that is, to the party from which the grant emanated.
This sort of surrender is authorized by law, and it ]s the only
sort of surrender contemplated by the statute. We have,
therefore, under this plea, nothing to do with any other surrender than that authorized by the statute.
It is further claimed by the. plaintiff, that "a surrender, under the 13th section, does not render the patent void ab rniio.
If the patentee chooses to risk a suit upon the original patent,
he may recover upon it for infringements committed.before it
was surrendered."
-Ido not consider it necessary to go into the inquiry whether,
for all purposes and in all aspects, the original patent, after its
surrender, is to be considered as void from its inception. We
are only concerned, in this case, as to the operation or effect
of the original patent as a cause of action, or a continuing
cause of action after the surrender. We do not aver that, at
the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff's patent was void,
but we merely say, that, after the suit was brought, the plaintiff surrendered his patent. This the plaintiff admits. What,
then, is the effect of a surrender upon an action pending at the
time ,of the surrender 9

The surrender is to be allowed when the patent "shall be
inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient
description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming in his specification, as his own invention, more than he
had, or shall have, a right to claim as new"
These are the conditions on which alone, according to the
statute, the surrender is authorized. When, therefore, the patentee avails himself of this permisson, he must be taken to

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

279

.offitt vs. Garr et al.

admit that his patent is inoperative or invalid, at least until
there is some averment to the contrary
But further, the act of surrender extinguishes the right of
action so far as the old patent is concerned, for there is uo reservation of any right, either for prior or subsequent infringements, or for actions pending, to ,be asserted upon the old
patent after the surrender. The only right saved is under a
reissue, and in virtue of the new patent, and this new right is
confined by the express terms of the staGute to "actions hereafter commenced for causes subsequently accruing." In the
case at bar, the plaintiff counts upon a cause of action which
accrued prior to the surrender, but the only rights which
survive the surrender, survive alone by virtue of the new
patent. Consequently, if the new patent does not sustain the
pending action, the old one cannot have that effect.
In the case of Woodworth vs. Stone, (3 Story's Rep., 749,) a
question arose upon the effect of a surrender and reissue pendente lite. The case was upon a bill for an injunction. Judge
Story held that the case might proceed, notwithstanding the
surrender or reissue, to prevent future and threatened infringements, and carefully distinguishes such a suit from an action
at law, which only regards the past.
I do not find that the precise question now under consideration has been decided by this court. In Stimpson vs. Westchester 1?. B., (4 How., 402,) the court say "The charge of infringement in the declaration is laid some years after the new
patent, so that the question does not arise whether an action
could be sustained for a violation of the right prior to the corrected patent."
The case from which the above quotation was made arose
under the 3d section of the act of 1832, which first provided
for a reissue. It will be found that it did not contain the provision contained in the 13th section of the act of 1836, confining the new patent to "causes subsequently accruing," and it
would seem that this provision was added to settle any question which might arise upon the act of 1832.
In the case of Batten vs. Taylor, (17 How., 74, ) the court

SUPREME COURT.
Moffitt vs. Gan" et al.

;cqame very near to a decision of this question, for it is said
"The plaintiff, by a surrender of that patent and the procurem ent of the patent of 1849 with the amended specifications,
abandoned the first patent, and relied wholly on the one reIssued."
Mr Curtis, in his Treatise on Patents, (sec. 255,) seems to
Sake it for granted, that, after the surrender, the infringement
,Must be subsequent.
See also Ames vs. Howard, (1 Sumner, 482, 488.)
The counsel for the plaintiff cite the case of Eastmanvs. Bod,sh, (1 Story, 529.) That case has no relation to a surrender.
It was a suit upon an extended patent, and simply decides that,
as the time laid for the infringement fell within the time of
,extension, the.plaintiff could not rely upon an infringement
prior to the extension, but must be confined to the time laid
n the declaration. Nor does the case decide that if the time
had been laid prior to the extension the plaintiff might have
recovered. However that may be, a patent extended is quite
another thing from a patent surrendered.
I find only one case in the English books which has any re)tion to the case at bar-Perrjvs. Skanner, (Webster's Patent
Reports, 850.) That case was upon a disclaimer, under a statuate which made the amended specification part of the original
patent, and the reporter adds this note at the close of the case
.. The result of the above decision would appear to be that
the party entitled to letters patent in the title or specification,
pf which any disclaimer or memorandum of alteration has been
enrolled, has no remedy at law in respect of an infringement
prior to the date of the enrolment of such disclaimer or memorandum of alteration, but from the date of such enrolment the
patentee acquires a new title."
If this is the consequence of a disclaimer, which becomes
part of the old patent, how can there be a doubt that the same
,consequence results from a surrender and reissue 9 If the disclaimer works a new title by implication, the surrender and
reissue do the same thing expressly
.In England the surrender of a patent works a total extinc-

DEOEMBER TERM, 1861.
ffoffltt vs. Garr et al.

tlion of the grant for all purposes. I do not claim such an effect
from our statutory surrender, except as to infringements prior
to the surrender.
It is very certain that, from the date of the surrender and
reissue, there is only one patent ?n esse, for there cannot be
two patents for the same invention existing at the same time.
'Whatever rights survive the surrender must be-asserted under
the reissued patent, which, for some purposes, has relation to
the original grant. The idea suggested by the plaintiff's counsel, that, after the original patent has been surrendered, that
patent may be used as the foundation for an action, or introduced in proof as a valid title, seems to me wholly inadmissible.
The plaintiff also claims that the plea is bad, because it does
not aver a cancellation of the surrendered patent, and cites 17
How., 80. The case warrants no such conclusion. There is
nothing in the statute about cancellation, and this word, whenever used by this court, is used as an equivalent term for
surrender. In England no surrender can be made without a
record, and perhaps a cancellation, but there a surrender works
a total relinquishment of the grant, and as the Crown cannot
ruceive such a relinquishment without a record, this ceremony
is necessary Uindmarsh on Patents, 246.
In conclusion, I beg to call the attention of the court to the
following facts shown by the record. The original patent was
granted to the plaintiff on the 80th November, 1852. This
patent was surrendered on the 2.3d March, 1858, as is alleged
in the declaration, "in consequence of an insufficient and defective description and specification of said invention, and such
proceedings were then had, that, on said 23d day of March,
1858, a new patent was granted to said plaintiff on an amended
description and specification, previously filed in the Patent
Office, for the same invention and improvement, and in accordance with said amended description and specification, which
said new letters patent bear date March 23, 1858;" and then
profert is made "of said reissued letters patent."
The infringement is next alleged to have been made or committed "after the making of said letters patent, after the reissue thereof," to wit, "on the 25th day of March, 1858, and

SUPREME COURT.
.offltt vs. Garr et al.

on divers other days and times between that day and the commencement of this suit." There is no question that these averments confine the plaintiffs to infringements after the reissue
under the new patent. The plea then alleges "a surrender
was made after the commencement of the suit of the patent
before that time issued to him, and for the alleged infringement
of which this action is brought." NVow, it is perfectly clear
that the original patent cannot be resorted to as a foundation
for suit for infringements after its surrender, and during the
life of the reissued patent. So, too, it is equally clear that infringements during the time of the new patent cannot after its
surrender survive such surrender; for all rights of action under
the reissued patent are totally gone, and whatever rights survive, as to duration of the term, &c., have relation only to the
first patent.
The suit was brought by Moffitt
Mr. Justice TELSONS.
against the defendants, for the infringement of a patent for an
"improvement in grain separators."
The defendants plead to the declaration, that since the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff had surrendered his patent
to the United States, for the alleged infringement of which
the action was brought. To which the plaintiff put in a general demurrer. The court overruled the demurrer, and sustained the plea, and gave judgment accordingly
The 13th section of the act of Congress of July 4, 1836,
provides, "that if a patent shall be inoperative, &c., it shall
be lawful for the Commissioner, upon the surrender to him of
such patent," "to cause a new patent to be issued, &c., and
the patent so reissued" "shall have the same effect and operation in law on the trial of all actions hereafter commenced, for
o)auses subsequently accruing, as though the same had been
originally filed in the connected form," &c.
Now, the point in the case is, whether or not the patentee
may maintain a suit on the surrendered patent instituted before the surrender, if he has not availed himself of the whole
of the provision, and taken out a reissue of his patent with an
amended spalcfication. The construction given to this section,

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

283

United States vs. JFallejo.

so far as we know, and the practice under it, in case of a surrender and reissue, are that the pending suits fall with the surrender. A surrender of the patent to the Commissioner within
the sense of the provision, means an act which, in judgment of
law, extinguishes the patent. It is a legal cancellation of it,
and hence can no more be the foundation for the assertion of
a right after the surrender, than could an act of Congress which
has been repealed. It has frequently been determined that
suits pending, which rest upon an act of Congress, fall with
the repeal of it. The reissue of the patent has no connection
with or bearing upon antecedent suits; it has as to subsequent
suits. The antecedent suits depend upon the patent existing
at the time they were commenced, and unless it exists, and is
in force at the time of trial and judgment, the suits fail.
It is a mistake to suppose, that, upon this construction,
moneys recovered on judgments in suits, or voluntary payment
under the first patent upon the surrender, might be recovered
back. The title to these moneys does not depend upon the
patent, but upon the voluntary payment or the judgment of
the court.
We are satisfied the judgment of the court below is right,
and should be affirmed.
