UNITED STATES VS. VALLEJO.

1. The decree of the Spanish Cortes relative to crown lands passed in
1813, being inapplicable to the state of things which existed in
Mexico after the revolution of 1820, could not have continued in
force there unless expressly recognised by the Mexican Congress,
and not then without being essentially modified.
2. The Spanish system of disposing of public lands was very different
from that provided for by the Mexican law of 1824, and the regulations of 1828. The two laws being repugnant and inconsistent,
the former was repealed by the latter.
3. The law of 1824 and the regulations of 1828 are the only laws of
Mexico on the subject of granting the public lands in the territories,
(excepting those regulating towns and missions,) and the authority
of the governors and other officers is defined by them.
4. A paper, purporting to be a grant of public land, but not registered,
recorded, or noted in the proper book, is inconsistent with the known
practice of every well regulated government, which requires that
all such acts shall be enrolled.
5. A false note of the attesting secretary at the bottom of the grant, to
the effect that it has been registered, is a serious objection to the
claim under it.
Don Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo petitioned the Land Com-

mission at San Francisco for confirmation of his claim to the
tract known by the name of Suscol, bounqed on the north by
Tulucay, and Suisun 'n the east, and south by the Straits of
Carquines, Mare Island, and Napa Bay. It includes the city,
of Benicia, the town of Vallejo, the navy-yard of the United
States, and the depot of the Pacific Steamship Company, and

contains altogether about eighteen square leagues.
The documents introduced to show title in the claimants
were: 1. A colonization grant to Vallejo, dated 15th March,
1843, in the usual form, and with the usual conditions, signed
by Micheltorena as Governor, and countersigned by Francisco
Arce as Secretary ad interim. 2. Another grant, bearing the
date of June 19, 1844, reciting that Vallejo had requested the

purchase of the tract for the sum of five thousand dollars; that
the Governor had sold it to him for that sum, and received
payment; and declaring him to be owner of the land without restriction. This paper also purported to be signed and
countersigned byMicheltorena andArce. 8. A certificate dated
26th of December, 1845, signed by Pio Pico as Governor, and
attested by Jos6 Maria Covarrubias, setting forth that both
the-grants above mentioned had been approved by the Departmental Assembly on the 26th of September, 1845. These papers
were all produced from the private custody of the claimant
himself. Neither of the grants is referred to in Jimeno's catalogue, or recorded in the Toma de Razon, nor is any espediente found for either of them among the archives. The journals of the Departmental Assembly show that these grants
were not before that body, either on the 26th of September,
1845, as certified by Pico, or on any other day. The following
official letter, dated at Angeles, March 16, 1843, addressed to
"Colonel D. Guadalupe Vallejo, military commandant of the
line from Santa Juez to Sonoma," signed Micheltorena, and
sealed with the seal of the Departmental Government, was also
produced by the claimant, and proved to be authentic by reference to the recorded correspondence of the Governor for the
period to which it belonged:
"I transmit to you the title of the place named Suscol, this
Government regretting that it cannot accept the first of the
offers which you made; because the supreme government of
the nation has ordered that all back paki be suspended, which
became due before the 1st of October, 1841, which will serve
you as a rule with respect to your subordinates; which suspension was made to continue until the public treasury should
be released from its embarrassments, and by which even I had
to suffer a loss of a considerable amount, of some thousands
of dollars; but I do accept the offer of the five thousand dollars in articles of the produce of the country for the troops, on
account of the imperious necessity which I have for them, in
order to maintain them, for which purpose I send the schooner
California,, that you may have the goodness to load her with

five hundred fanegas of maize, two hundred and fifty of flijoles,
two hundred arrobas of dried meat, and five hundred pairs of
shoes, or the material for making them, which I am told it
will not be difficult for you to send; and surmising also that it
will not be very inconvenient for you, I earnestly request that
you will send me two thousand dollars in silver, in consideration of the fact that the treasury of the department is short of
funds, as it has not received anything" since my arrival, there
having been no arrivals of vessels; and besides this, the troops
of my expedition are daily furnished with cash in hand, as they
are subject to a mode of payment, administration, and customs
different from the presidial troops, as you know, in the same
manner as the rest of the national army, and for which sum it
will be exceedingly grateful. All of which I communicate to
you for your information, assuring you at the same time of my
consideration and esteem. God and Liberty!"
J. B. R. Cooper testified that he was captain of the California, a goleta or schooner of eighty-five tons burden, belonging
to the department, and used to carry mails, troops, and supplies
up and down the coast; that about the year 1842, or 1843, he
took a full cargo of supplies, consisting of wheat, corn, barley,
beans, peas, blankets, tanned leather, shoes, and deer skins,
from Petaluma to San Diego; that these supplies werefor Governor Micheltorena, and furnished by Vallejo; that the Governor told him Vallejo had offered $20,000 for Suscol, and the
witness understood these supplies were to go in payment.
Four witnesses (but the character of one was impeached) testified that the ranch was occupied by Vallejo for a long time
before, as well as after, 1843; they speak of ro occupancy by
any other person, and say that he had buildings on it, many
thousands of horses, cattle, and hogs, with extensive cultivation. It appeared, however, that the ranch was originally used
by the mission of San Francisco Solano, and the first improvements on it were made by the padres. In 1839 it was taken
by the Government for military purposes, and it was under the
supervision of Colonel Vallejo, because he was the com'mandant of the northern frontier, with his headquarters at Sonoma

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. rFallijo.

and his private residence near by, at Petaluma. Three witnesses on the part of the United States testified that they knew
the land; that it was called the "iRancho :Nacional;" that it
was occupied and cultivated by soldiers of the Mexican army
down to the time of the American conquest, when they were
driven away; that all the stock upon it was public property,
and used as such to supply the soldieri with beef, &c.; and that
Vallejo had possession of it for the Government as a military
officer; but they never heard of any private claim to it until
long after the conquest.
Watson, a witness produced by the United States, swore,
that in 1848 he proposed to purchase a part of the land from
Vallejo, and Vallejo then told him that he had bought it from
the Suscol Indians; but he expected the United States Government would swindle him out of it, and refused, for that
reason, to sell with a warranty of title.
The evidence given by the claimant to establish the authenticity of the grants was contained in the deposition of Pablo
de la Guerra, who declared on his oath that he knew the handwrifing of Micheltorena and Arce, and that their signatures to
the two grants were genuine, to the best of his knowledge and
belief. Arce, the attesting and official witness, was not called.
After the evidence was closed and the cause submitted, a motion was made on the part of the United States to open it for
the purpose of calling Arce on their part. This motion was
founded on two affidavits expressing the belief of the affiants
that Arce would prove the grants to be false. It was resisted,
and the court refused to take off the submission.
The claimant took the deposition of I. D. Marks, who testified to conversations with Micheltorena in Mexico after he
was Governor of California, in which Micheltorena told him
that he had extraordinary powers as Governor, and that his
acts had been approved. The same witness was also told by
Jose Fernando Ramirez, Secretary of State of Mexico, that full
powers to grant lands in California had been delegated to
Micheltorena by Santa Anna, under the Bases of Tacubaya.

mission, approving the title and confirming the claim for the
whole tract described in the petition; whereupon the United
States took this appeal to the Supreme Court.
3fr. Black, of Pennsylvania, and lMr. Green, of Missouri, for
the United States. Both these grants are destitute of what
the court has often held to be indispensable-namely, a record.
The grant of 1843 is not on Jimeno's index, and that of 1844
is not on the Toma de Razon. Neither is there an espediente
for either of them. These defects are so clearly fatal, that an
argument concerning them is useless. The absence of a registry and an espediente, prove that no such grants were ever
issued. The journals of the Departmental Assembly show
that the certificate of approval is also a sheer fabrication.
The evidence in support of these grants would be wholly
insufficient to establish even a private paper. The claimants
called Pablo de ]a Guerra to prove the handwriting of the signatures, and did not call Arce, who was in full life, and within
the jurisdiction of the court. Nay, when the claimants closed
the evidence without calling the subscribing witness, the
United States proposed to call him, but the motion was successfully resisted. This court is bound to presume that the
claimants kept away the only witness in the world who knew
when, how, and by whom the papers were made, for fear that
the truth, if told, would overthrow their case. The law does
not allow any other construction to be put on such conduct.
The only genuine paper produced is the letter from Micheltorena to Vallejo. But it is really inconsistent with every
part of the case which the claimants have attempted to make
out. It refers to a title for the place called Suscol. What
title? In whose favor? It is dated the day after the first
grant, and more than a year before the other. Would the
Goiernor have made a, colonization grant if he intended to
sell? And after making a bargain to sell, would he transmit
a title reciting a naked grant, without a consideration, before
he received the purchase money? Of the two ofers, which
the Governor says Vallejo has made him, neither is intelligibly
defined. Te says he cannot accept the first, because back pay

is suspended; but he accepts the offer of $5,000 in produce, and
he urgently requests that Vallejo will send him $2,000 besides
in silver. There is not a word in all this to indicate that the
offers had any reference to the land. No doubt Vallejo was
in debt to the Government; Micheltorena was dunning him,
and Vallejo was offering to set off his back pay or to discharge
a part of the claim in produce. The latter proposition the
Governor acceded to, but insisted at the same time on having
some cash besides. If the other side of the correspondence
had been produced-that is, Vallejo's letter containing the offers-tbe whole could have been understood. Why was it kept
out of sight? For the same reason that Arce's testimony was
withheld-the truth did not suit the purpose.
Three other grants with which Vallejo was connected are
referred to as throwing light on this one: the Petalurna Sobrante, concerning which the evidence is found on this record;
the Lup Yumi, (22 How., 392;) and the Yuiupi, (22 How., 416;)
which have been already investigated in this court. These
three grants, together with that for Suseol, are all dated in
1844; all countersigned by Arce; none of them is recorded,
and are all falsely certified to have been recorded. Here is a
printed copy of all the grants, dated in 1844, on which claims
were set up before the Land Commission; (Limantour Exhibits,)
and it shows that Jimeno was at his post during the whole of
that year, and attested every registered grant except one to
himself. It is worthy of notice, too, that Arce was never
called as a witness to prove any of the unregistered grants to
which his name is appended.
The power of the political chief was limited by the colonization laws of 1824 and 1828, and they give him no power to
sell lands; nor had he any authority either to give or sell lands
which were not vacant, but occupied and used like this Rancho Nacional, by the Government, for its special and necessary
purposes. The effort to change the law by proving the loose
conversations of Micheltorena and Ramirez is, of course, unavailing. A book was cited by the judge below entitled Leyes
Vigentes, published at Mexico, and page 58 is referred to. Here
is Leyes Vigentes, ar d1here is page 58. It contains a decree of

DECOEIBER TERM, 1861.

the Spanish Cortes made in 1813 on the subject of the crown
lands, but not a word affecting this question in the remotest
degree. The provisions it does contain are inconsistent with,
and therefore repealed by, the law of 1824.
But, assuming that the Governor bad a power not given by
tho colonization law, and conceding that he could sell a public
ranch occupied for military purposes, does it follow that he
could convey it without making his act a matter of record?
On general principles this must be answered in the negative.
A grant not recorded is but the private deed of the officer who
makes it, says Judge G6'er in Luco's case. In every well regnlated Government, the deeds of its officers are enrolled, says
Judge Campbell in Sutler's case. A private deed made by a
public officer for a part of the public domain, upon a consideration paid to the officer himself, is not binding on the public
either in law or equity.
The opinion of the judge below is based on a mistaken view
of the law, and on erroneous assumptions of fact, to wit: that
the title-papers were admitted to be genuine; that there was a
money considerationpaid for the grant, and that possession was
taken as ordinary under Mexican law. This is wholly wrong.
There was no such admission; the grant was denounced as false
from first to last, and the record shows it. There is no reliable evidence that a penny was ever paid for it; and no pos-"
session was ever given or taken according to any law, custom,
or usage.
Mr. -Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, and 31r. .XeCaWl, of
Kentucky. The genuineness of these title-papers was admitted. The statement of that fact in the written opinion of the
court below is not only ample, but conclusive evidence of it.
This being settled, the United States will not be permitted
here in the appellate court to raise the question again. Besides, the evidence was sufficient without the admission to
show that the papers were executed. The non-production of
an espediente and the failure to call Arce are not, under the
circumstances of this case, any grounds for rejecting the blaim'
here. The want of a registry does not prove that the titles

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Valeo.

were not issued. As to the certificate of approval by the Departmental Assembly, it makes no difference whether that be
true or not, foran approval is not necessary to the validity of
the title.
The counsel of the other side rely upon the cases in which
the court has decided against claims under colonization grants.
This claim is under a sale made by the Government to a citizen
for a consideration paid, and is, therefore, not within the principle of those cases. The law of 1824 and the regulations of
1828 do not apply to it.
The power of the Governor to make such a sale is not a
thing to be doubted. It existed anterior to the colonization
law of 1824, and was not taken away by that law. The testimony of Marks shows that it was claimed and exercised by
Micheltorena, and that it was conceded by the official authorities of the Supreme Government.
But even if the Governor had transcended the strict limits
of his legal authority, yet, as it was made on a valuable consideration, it constitutes an equitable claim which ought to be
confirmed. A title that would have been confirmed by the
Mexican Government will be confirmed here; and this court
is bound to presume that Mexico would confirm any title which
in good conscience ought to be confirmed. With what regard
to her faith and honor could Mexico refuse to admit the justice
and honesty of a title which was paid for by the grantee, and
of which she had the price in her.treasury, or applied it to the
public service? It would be monstrous to suppose that she
could quibble with one who had paid her his money about the
technical form in which his contract was made.
The letter of Micheltorena to Vallejo is admitted to be genuine. That letter, taken in connection with Cooper's evidence,
shows very conclusively that an honest and fair price-the price
demanded -by the Government-was paid for the land in question.
General Vallejo was one of the most distir guished men of
the Mexican Republic; performed for many years the most important and valuable services, and was highly appreciated by
the Supreme as well as the Departmental Government, He is

now one of the most respectable citizens of California. IHis
character makes it impossible to suppose that he would assert
a claim to land which was not his own. In point of fact, no
such suspicion as to this title ever entered the minds of Californians. They knew it was all right, and in that conviction
large numbers of persons have bought these lands. Thousands are interested in the confirmation, and there is no oppoII
sing interest which deserves the slightest favor.
Mr. Justice NELSON. This is an appeal from a decree of
the District Court of the United States for the northern district of California.
The claim of Vallejo and his assigns covers a tract of land
known by the name of Suscol, in the county of Solano, California, bounded on the north by lands named Tulucay and
Suisun, on the east and south by the Straits of Carquines, Ysla
del a Yegua, and the Estero de Napa, without any limitation
as to quantity, and embraces from ninety to one hundred thou.
sand acres, including Mare Island, on which the United States
have established their navy-yard on the Pacific, and the city
of Benicia, situate on the bay of San Francisco. Two grants
of the tract to Vallejo were given in evidence-one a colonization grant, dated 15th March, 1843, and the other a grant
founded on a sale for the consideration of $5,000, dated 19th
June, 1844. Both grants purport to be signed by Micheltorena, Governor, and Francisco Arce, Secretary ad interim.
From a letter of Micheltorena to Vallejo, 16th March, 1843,
one day after the date of the colonization grant, in which he
states that he transmits to him a title for the place named
Suscol, and that he accepts the offer to pay $5,000 for the same,
it is reasonable to conclude that the colonization grant was
intended to be founded on the contract of sale; and doubting,
perhaps, that the grant could not be maintained in this form,
the second was executed without any reference to the colonization laws.
A paper purporting to be a decree for the formal approval
of these two grants by the Departmental Assembly, dated 26th

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. liallejo.

September, 1845, and signed by Pio Pico, and Jos6 Ma. Covarrubias, Secretary, is in the record, but there is no evidence of
its genuineness. It seems to have been given up as spurious.
The evidence of possession and cultivation is slight. Indeed, considering the magnitude of the tract granted, it is entitled to very little weight. As the grants were dated 1843
and 1844, and the country taken possession of by this Government in 1846, there could be but two or three years' possession
or occupation under them at the time of our taking possession.
The evidence that Vallejo occupied and cultivated the tract
previous to the grants, which, of itself, is slight and unsatisfactory, is still further weakened by the fact, which is shown,
that the ranch had been occupied by the claimant as a military
commandant with soldiers and Government property.
The witnesses, who speak of the possession as early as 1841,
might very readily have confounded this possession for the
uses of the Government with a possession for Vallejo himselF.
We can give very little weight to a possession so limited as to
duration and in extent, when offered in support of a grant of
ninety or one hundred thousand acres of land. If the grant
cannot be maintained by its own force and effect, this possession will scarcely uphold it. Coming then to the grants, we
may as well lay aside the first one, the colonization grant, at
once, as entirely defective within the law of 1824 and the
regulations of 1828. The only document in evidence is the
naked grant itself. It would be a waste of time, after the
numerous caseA in this court on these titles, to go over the
objections to this source of title.
The next is the grant founded on the sale, and which is the
only one entitled to consideration.
The main objection to this grant is the want of power in
the Governor to make it; and this raises the question, whether
or not the Governor possessed any power to make grants of
the public lands independently of that conferred by the act
of 1824 and the regulations of 1828.
1 The Mexican Congress, after the country had thrown off the
government of Spain, and had erected a new and an independ.

ent government in its place, representing the sovereign power
of the nation, passed the law of 1824 providing for the grant
and colonization of the public lands.
The second section provides that the lands of the nation;
which are not the property of any individual, corporation, or
town, are the subject of this law, and may be colonized. Section third: For this purpose the Congress of the States shall,
with the least delay, enact laws and regulations for colonizing
within their respective boundaries, conforming in all respects
to the constitutive act, the general constitution, and the rules established in this law.
The act then prohibits the colonization of any lands within
twenty leagues bordering on any foreign nation, or within ten
leagues of the sea-coast, without the consent of the supreme
government; and further, that in the distribution of the lands
preference is to be given to Mexican citizens; that no person
shall be allowed to obtain a grant of more than eleven leagues;
and that no person who may obtain a grant under the law shall
retain it if he resides out of the limits of the republic.
The sikteenth section then provides, that the Executive shall
proceed, in conformity with the principles established in this
law, to- the colonization of the Territories of the republic.
The Supreme Executive Government, acting under the above
sixteenth section, on the 21st November, 1828, established regulations for the granting and colonization of the public lands
in the Territories, and, among others, in California.
The first section declares, "that the political chiefs (the Gov.
ernors) of the Territories are hereby authorized to grant vacant
lands within their respective Territories," "to either Mexicans
or foreigners who may petition for them, with the object of
cultivation or settlement. Said grants shall be made according to the laws of the general Congress of 18th August, 1824,
and under their qualifications."
Then follows a series of preliminary proceedings, specially
enjoined for the purpose of ascertaining the fitness of the petitioner to receive a grant, and also of ascertaining if the land
asked for may be granted without prejudice to the public or
individuals; and it is declared, in view of these, the Governor

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs.

ialloro.

will grant or not the land; but if the grant is made, it must be
in strict conformity with the laws upon the subject, and especially with reference to the law of 1824; and the grants made to
individuals or families shall not be definitively valid without
the previous consent of the Departmental Assembly.
Section eighth. The grant petitioned for having been definitively made, a patent, signed by the Governor, shall be issued,
which shall serve as a title to the party, expressing therein that
the grant has been made in strict accordance with the provisions of the law, by virtue of which possession shall be taken;
and section nine, of all petitions and grants a record shall be
made in a book kept for that purpose, with the plats of the
land granted.
There are many other stringent provisions and conditions
imposed which it is not important to refer to specially; it is
sufficient to say, that the system thus established by the sovereign power of the nation for the grant and distribution of
the public lands, exhibits a deliberation and care over the subject that is in striking contrast with the system of granting
the public lands under our Government, and furnishes the
highest evidence of the extreme interest the Mexican Government took in guarding against impositions and frauds, by or
upon the political chiefs in the execution of the law.
Now, the above are the only laws of the Mexican Congress
passed on the subject of granting the public lands, with the
exception of those relating to the missions and towns, which
have no bearing upon the question. 1o others have been
produced on the argument, nor have our researches found any,
nor were any others discovered by the public agents which
were authorized by this Government to inquire particularly
into the subject. (See Halleck's Rep., March 1, 1849, Exec.
Doe., 1st Sess. 31st Cong., p. 119; Jone's Rep., April 10, 1850,
Senate Doe., 2d Sess..31st Cong., p. 18; see also Calif. 3 Rep.,

24 ib., 349.)
The ground taken to uphold this grant concedes that no
other power has been conferred upon the Governor by any express act of the Mexican Congress; but it is insisted that the

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

law of 1824, and regulations of 1828, did not repeal the power,
if it previously existed, to make a grant of the public lands by
sale for a pecuniary consideration; and the decree of the Spanish Cortes, of January, 1813, is referred to as confirming that
authority.
But any one looking into this law will see that it provides
for a very different system of disposing of these lands from that
found in the Mexican law of 1824, and the regulations of 1828;
and unless specifically recognised or excepted, would necessarily be repealed as repugnant and inconsistent with the system
adopted. After providing for the reduction of the public lands
to private ownership in the way and with the qualifications
stated, the act declares, that half of the vacant and crown lands
of the monarchy shall be reserved as a security for the payment of the national debt, and of those to whom the nation is
indebted, who are inhabitants of villages to which the lands
ace adjacent; and provision is made for the distribution of
them to the public creditors belonging to these villages; also
for distribution among the officers and. soldiers of the army;
and then provides, that the location of these tracts shall he
made by a board of magistrates of the villages to which the
lands are adjacent, and the proceedings are afterwards to be
sent to the provincial deputation for approval.
The law then provides for grants of the residue of the vacant
or crown lands to every inhabitant of the villages who ask for
them for the purpose of cultivation, and has no land of his
own. The patents are to be made by a board of magistrates
free of charge, and the provincial delegation are to approve of
them. The decree was to be published not only among all
the people of the kingdom, but among the national armies, aind
in every way, so that it might come to the knowledge of all the
subjects.
This law may be very properly referred to as the foundation
and source of many titles to the public lands 'n the Mexican
Government, and also of titles in the province or Territory of
California, if any were derived under it during the authority
of the Spanish Government. The change of Government would
not affect them. But grants made after this change, and the

SUPREME COURT
United States vs. Yalleo.

establishment of a new and independent Government, present
a very different question. Grants under this law were to be
made to the creditors, officers, and soldiers of the old Government. They were called rewards for patriotism, and were not
to be extended to individuals other than those who may serve
or who have served in the pres'ent war, (war between the Emperor Napoleon and Spain then existing,) or in quelling disturbances in some of the provinces beyond sea. Individuals,
not military men, who had served in their districts, or contributed in -any other way in this war, or in the disturbances
in America, and who were injured or crippled, or disabled in
battle, were included in the grants to be made. Serious disturbances existed in the vice-royalty of Mexico at this time,
arising out of revolutionary struggles, headed by tidalgo Morelos and Bravo. One of the objects of the law was to compensate and encourage the defenders of the mother Government against these revolutionary movements.
Without pursuing the inquiry further, we think it quite
clear that this law could not have been in force after the change
of Government, unless expressly recognised by the Mexican
Congress; and not then, without being first essentially modified in its policy and purposes; and ceiLtainly, unless thus
modified, and the power in express terms conferred on the
political chiefs of the Territories to grant the public lands on
sale, no such power can be derived from its provisions.
There are other serious objections to this claim. It is directed in the title-paper that a "note be made of it in the respective book;" and the Secretary ad interim declares at the
foot of the grant, "note has been made of this title in the respective book." The grant, as we have seen, was made 19th
June, 1844. The book of records of that year is in existence,
and in good condition. No record was made of the title. The
note of the Secretary is untrue. It was well said, in The United
States vs. Sutter, (21 How., 175,) that "in every well-regulated
Government the deeds of its officers, conveying parts of, the
public domain, are registered or enrolled, to furnish permanent evidence to its grantees of the origin of their title." An
exemplification of such a record is admissible as evidence of

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

the same dignity as of the grant itself. (5 Peters, 233; 15
How., 1.)
This rule exists in States which have adopted the civil law.
In those States the deed is preserved in the archives, and copies
are given as authentic acts-that is, acts which have a certain
and accredited authority and merit confidence. The acts thus
preserved are public instruments, and all doubts that arise
upon the copies that may be delivered are resolved by a reference to the protocol from which the copies are taken, and without which they have no authority.
We add, it is important, also, that a record should be made
of these grants, so that the Government may be advised in
respect to the portions of the public domain that have bee'a
soldeor disposed of, and as a security against the frauds of the
public officers upon whom the power of making the granis
has been conferred. Grants of this description, when made
in due and orderly form, are either made at the seat of government, where the public records are kept, and a record can be
readily made, or, if signed by the public officer residing at a
different place, are not deemed grants till the proper record is
made.
Without this guard, the officers making the grants, as, in the
present instance, the Governor and Secretary, would be enabled
to carry with them in their travels blank forms, and dispose
of the public domain at will, leaving the Government without
the means of information on the subject till the grant is produced from the pocket of the grantee.
Without pursuing the examination further, in every view
we have been able to take of the case, we are satisfied-that the
grant is one that should not be confirmed, and we shall order
the judgment below to be reversed, and the record remitted
to the court to enter judgment for the United States.
Mr. Justice GRIER. I cannot consent, by my silence, that
an inference should be drawn that I concur in the opinion
just delivered. I cannot agree to confiscate the property of
some thousand of our fellow-citizens, who have purchased under this title and snade improvements to the value of many

millions, on suspicions first raised he-re as to the integrity of a
grant universally acknowledged to be genuine in the country
where it originated. I do not intend to enter into any argument with my brethren of the majority. If they are satisfied
with the conclusion, the presumption is, that the minority ie
mistaken. And I would not wish to weaken any arguments
that may be urged to justify this wholesale confiscation. I
shall merely mention a few of the facts and principles on which
I have been constrained to dissent.
. This Government has bound itself by a solemn treaty to respect all just claims which the citizens of California held at its
date. I shall not comment upon the good faith with which
this obligation has been observed, or whether it was acting in
good faith to these new citizens to compel every owner of a
grant or title under Mexico to enter into a long and expensive
litigation, beginning at home and ending here; a litigation,
too, with one who paid no costs, while it was ruinous to the
claimant, who, if he retained one-half for himself, when successful, was considered fortunate. Instead of protection of
their possessions, they were, in many instances, left a prey to
squatters and champertons' attorneys. This was a great evil,
but perhaps a necessary one. The change of sovereignty from
Mexico to this Government at once gave value to lands which
before had none, and which Mexico was glad to give away to
colonists for nothing. There unit of measurement was a square
league, and eleven of these (nearly equal to 50,000 acres) was
the only maximum. The sudden affluence of those of the
former settlers who had retained any considerable proportion
of their square leagues, and of those who purchased their titles
for a trifle, caused not only a mania for land speculation, but a
system of extensive frauds, with forged grants and pejured
witnesses, such as the world has seldom witnessed. If a large
grant of land in California, like the one before us, were suddenly produced from the pocket of some obscure person, such
as Jose de ]a Rosa or Santillan, it should excite suspicion and
be scrutinized with the utmost rigor. But where a grant is
public and notorious, without suspicion of fraud or forgerywhere a large consideration was paid to the Mexican Govern-

ment-where possession has been taken and held for sixteen
years-where numerous purchasers have made improvements
worth millions, it is the duty of the court to deal with it according to the rules of equity and justice, instead of applying
sharp rules of decision to inflict a forfeiture.
In a country where land had no value, where it was freely
given to all who asked, without money and without price, in
amounts not to exceed fifty thousand acres, it will be supposed
that there are few cases to be found where the Government
could raise money by the sale of it. This is, perhaps, the only
case to be found where such a sale has been made. The laws
of 1824 and 1828 were colonization laws; they regulated grants
of land madefor this purpose, and restrained the power of the
local gover'ment as to the amount to be given to one person.
They prescribed the proceedings and forms necessary to the
validity of such grants. This sale to Vallejo was not a colonization grant, nor were the regulations of 1824 and 1828 applicable to it, nor the decisions of this court in the ratification
of grants under them.
That there was a sale by the Governor to Vallejo for.a consideration paid, when the Governor could find no other way
to raise funds for the support of the Government, is satisfactorily proved. It was a matter of general notoriety at the time.
The copy of a letter from the Governor to the grantee accompanying the title is found among the archives. The first title
being defective in form, another was given confirming the sale
and acknowledging a consideration paid. Possession has followed in pursuance of it. Its authenticity was admitted in the
court below. But we are about to forfeit the title on the
ground that the Goveinor, though he might give away land
to any amount, had no authority to sell it for money. It is
assumed, that because there was a special power given by
statute to grant to colonists, therefore he had no other power.
This court has frequently decided that the authority of a Governor to make such a grant will be presumed from the fact
that he did make it, and that it lay upon those who deny the
power to prove the want of it.
But it is assumed that the power did not exist since the reg-

ulations of 1824, because it was not exercised. It is a much
better reason for the want of a precedent that land would not
be sold where it had so little value that it might be had as a
gift to the extent of 50,000 acres.
If this treaty is to be executed in good faith by this Government, why should we forfeit property for which a large price
has been paid to the Mexican Government, on the assumption
that the Mexican Government would not have confirmed it,
but would have repudiated it for want of formal authority?
Vallejo was an officet of the army, high in the confidence of
the Government. His salary as an officer had been in arrear.
In a time of difficulty he furnishes provisions and money to the
Government of the Territory. How do we know that Mexico
would have repudiated a sale of 80,000 acres as a robbery of
its territory, when any two decent colonists, having a few
horses and cows, could have 100,000 for nothing?
I believe the Mexican Government would have acted honestly and honorably with their valued servant, and that the
same obligation rests on us by force of the treaty.
INow that the land under our Government has become of
value these grants may appear enormous; but the court has a
duty to perform under the treaty, which gives us no authority
to forfeit a bona fide grant because it may not suit our notions
of prudence or propriety.
We are not, for that reason, to be astute in searching for
reasons to confiscate a man's property because he has too much.
Believing, therefore, that in the case before us the claimant
has presented a genuine grant for a consideration paid, which
the Mexican Government would never have disturbed for any
of the reasons now offered for confiscating it, I must express,
most respectfully, my dissent from the opinion of the majority
of the court, with the hope that Congress will not suffer the
very numerous purchasers to forfeit the millions expended on
the faith of treaty obligations.
Mr. Justice WAYNWE. I have examined this case with
much attention, and concur in the conclusions of my brother,
Mr. Justice G-ier; and will adcd,, that as I have neither seen

nor heard anything in the case so conclusive as the judicial
opinion of our brother, Judge -McAllister,I have determined
that the best course-which I can take to counteract the con-elusion to which this court has come in this case, will be to
adopt his opinion on the law of the case as more expressive of
my dissent than anything I could add. The part of it which
I refer to is as follows:
"This case is to be considered as one in which the titlepapers are admitted to be genuine, the payment of a money
consideration paid, and the possession of the claimant, as was
ordinarily taken under the laws and usages of Mexico, established. The sole grounds taken by the Government, on which
the validity of this claim is resisted, are:
"1. That no witness proves that a house was built within
one year from date of the grant of 1848. That a house was
built upon the land prior to the date of either grant by the
claimant is clearly proved. That a second house was not
built, (as subsequent condition,) especially in the case of an absolute sale, could not authorizea court of equity to forfeit any
interest which has become vested in the claimant.
"2. The second ground is, that the grant of 1844 is invalid,
because it is without restriction, and for a consideration of
$5,000 in money.
"8. Because the Governor has exceeded his power in making
a grant for the excess of eleven leagues.
"The two last objections, which urge the grant to be void
because it was a sale for a money consideration, and because
it exceeds in quantity eleven leagues, will be considered together. These objections apply to the second grant of 1844,
which purports to be on its very face an absolute sale.
"This grant cannot be deemed, in the language of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Cambuston case, (20
How., 64,) 'a pure donation without pecuniary consideration
or meritorious services rendered to the Government.' Nor
does it purport to be issued under the Mexican colonization
law of 1824, or the regulations of 1828. It is treated by the
Government attorney for what it really is, an unrestricted sale
for a pecuniary consideration. Had it been a pure donation,

United States vs. 'alleo.

made professedly under the laws of M¥exico, professing to have
been issued by virtue of those laws, and in pursuance of the
terms and provisions prescribed by them, proof of a compliance with the restrictions by the Governor would not have
been afforded by the recitals in the grant of his having done
so, especially if there had been doubt of the bona fides of the
grant. This is the extent to which the court went in the
Cambuston.case.
"It does not apply to a bona ftdes; all made to supply the
necessary wants of the Government, and applied to the removal
of them. If so intended, its practical effect would be in the
present and all analogous cases to nullify the applications of
the 'principles of equity,' which are made one of the rules
of decision by the act of Congress for this court in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it. Nothing was said by
the Supreme Court to justify such conclusion. In that case
they use language which indicates that if the grant had not
been a mere donation, had been free from suspicion, for meritorious services rendered to the Government, or a pecuniary
consideration, the claimant would have stood on a different
footing. They say, (20 How., 64,) 'In the examination of
this case, we have found it very difficult to resist a suspicion
as to the bona fides of the grant. It is a pure donation, without pecuniary consideration or meritorious services rendered
to the Mexican Government.'
"In the case of --remont vs. United States, Taney, C. J., says:
'And the grant was not merely to carry out the colonization
policy of the Government, but in consideration of the public
and patriotic services of the grantee. This inducement is
carefully set out in the title-papers; and although this cannot
be regarded as a money consideration, making the transaction
a purchase from the Government, yet it is the acknowledgment
of a just and equitable claim, and when the grant was made
on that consideration the title in a court of equity ought to be
as firm and valid as if it had been purchased with money on
the same conditions.'
"Now, in this case the grant was made for a money consideration by the Govern6r, to obtain, and who did obtain by it,

the means to maintain the starving soldiers of the country at
a critical moment of its then condition. This fact is ascertained by the official communication of the Governor to the
grantee, found in the Mexican archives for the year 1843, and
referred to in another record for the same year. The grantee
was in possession, open and- notorious, for three years, undisturbed, prior to the occupation of this country by the Americans. Under such circumstances, could the Mexican Government, had it continued, have refused to have recognised the
cldim of the grantee with justice or equity?
"If the facts, that' the Government received a pecuniary,
and, for aught that appears, adequate consideration, must necessarily avoid the grants, with the other circumstance, that
the quantity of land granted exceeded eleven square leagues,
it must be done because these grants are within the operation
of the colonization law of Mexico of 1824, in relation to ths
distribution of lands by donation, to carry out the colonizatio -i
policy exclusively, and which restricts the quantity of lands
to any one individual to eleven leagues.
"The power to give under certain restrictions, made evidently to prevent fraud in the distribution, did not, by implication, repeal the power, if it previously existed, to sell for a
pecuniary consideration, if bonaz fide exercised.
"That such power did exist in the Governors, the court will
now consider, and give its reasons for the conclusion to which
it is arrived.
"In a work published in 1829, in the city bf Mexico, among
the laws supposed to be retained in Mexico is the decree of
the Spanish Cortes of January 4th, 1813. This law evinced a
spirit and policy evidently more liberal than bad previously
animated Spanish legislation, and which probably did not operate in Spain, or any of its then colonies, but, it is reasonable
to believe, that in common with other decrees bf the Spanish
Cortes was called into active existence by the Spanish revoldtion of 1819, and was in force at the time of the independence
of Mexico.
"Such is the view enunciated by- the board of Land Commissioner s in the case of the City of Sn .ranisco vs. Unid

tates, and the publication of the decree in Mexico, in 1829,
-ao:neof the retained laws, as of force, confirms the opinion
.of the board.
"The Supreme Court of this State, in the case of Gokas vs.
-Rai n, (3 Cal., 443,) distinctly affirm its existence, and cite the
compilation in which it is given as 'Leyes Vigentes,' p. 58.
"That tribunal, in the case of Welch vs. Sullivan, (8 Cal., 168,)
again affirm the existence of this decree. The say the decree
of the Cortes in 1813 directs, etc.
"But there is internal evidence afforded by the Mexican le.gislation on the subject of colonization, that the existence of
the decree of 1813 was known, and legislation was enacted in
-view of some of its provisions. The diseno making the boundaries of the land petitioned for, which is required to accompany
ithe application to the Governor, is in conformity to the decree
of 1813. Again, the conditions usually inserted in the colonization grants under the Mexican law and regulations are similar to those prescribed in the 2d section of that decree. This,
in its.preamble, among other things, declares its object to be
'.to furnish with this class of lands (public lands) in aid of the
public necessities (wants) to reward meritorious defenders of
their country, and citizens who have no property.' The evident intent of this decree, declared on its face, is, that common
0.r.public lands should be converted into private property, and
lands granted should be distributed in full property, and with
established metes and bounds. Upon a careful revision of this
decree the conclusion must be, that in the absence of other legislation the carrying out this decree must have devolved on
the executive department, and the Governors of California,
under the instructions of the Supreme Government, would have
the power to grant common lands. lfow by that decree the
quantity of land granted to one individual was not limited to
any given quantity; but as to persons, it was limited to citizens.
"The only instance in which quantity is limited is in certain
donations to certain official persons, to whom small lots of prescribed extent were to be granted. This decree authorized
grants to meritorious defenders, and a sale of land to aid the
public necessities; and such sale, made in good faith, would

be the legitimate exercise of power, unless the provisions of
the decree confirming the power have been repealed by subsequent legislation. Have they been repealed, expressed or. by
fair implication, by the colonization law of 1824 of Mexico, or
by the regulations of 1828?
"Animated by a more liberal view of her interests, Mexico
determined to afford inducements to emigration, and she
opened her public lands to foreigners as well as citizens, and
determined to make donations for colonization purposes to all
who strictly complied with the terms which, in the distribution of the land, she prescribed to prevent fraud. Among
these was limiting the quantity of land in any donation to a
single person to eleven leagues. There are many reasons for
the legislation of Mexico to surround her system of colonization with checks and limits when the Governors were to dis-:
tribute the public lands, which do not apply to a bona fide sale
for money consideration. Such is not a case which, by implication, should be brought within the colonization laws. The
construction of a law, from the action of those whose duty it
is to carry it out, should be considered when endeavoring to
ascertain the intention of the Legislature. The fact that
sales have been made by Governors of lands in quantities of
more than eleven leagues, who would grant by donation to a
colonist not more than eleven, is a circumstance not to be disregarded.
"By the records of the case, United States vs. .odriguez, No.
479, among the files of the papers of the board of Land Commissioners, it is made to appear that Governor Pio Pico issued
a grant for twelve leagues in consideration of the sum of
$12,000, past indebtedness to the Government. The board
of Land Commissioners confirmed the claim. The land in
that case is situated in the southern district, and the records
inaccessible to us, and it is impracticable to ascertain whether
any appeal is pending, has been made, or been dismissed. The
opinion of the board is, however, on file among the archives
in the Surveyor General's office. In that opinion it is stated,
'that in consectuence of the importance of the two question

United States vs. Valljo.

involved, the court took the case under advisement, and also
for the reason that the determination of the case would settle
the fate of a large number of cases undetermined, so far as the
action of that tribunal was concerned.' The first of those
4uestions involved the only two 'grounds taken in the present.
It was, whether the power of the Government of California,
under the Mexican authority, existed to sell or grant for a
consideration of money, or with limits to exceed in amount
eleven leagues. The board decided that he had such power.
"In the case of The United States vs. rG. Vallejo, N o. 321,
the same tribunal affirmed the principle decided in the previous case, and confirmed the claim to fifteen leagues. In
their'opinion the board say, 'there appears no objection to the
confirmation of this claim, except that it exceeds in amount
the maximum authorized to be granted under the provision of
the colonization law. The last five leagues do not appear tD
have been granted under those provisions, but a sale for a:a
actual consideration received by the Government of two thousand dollars. This point was fully considered and decided by
the court in case 479, and the doctrine recognised that a bonL
fide sale, made for a full consideration, by the Governor of California., under the Mexican laws, vested in the purchaser both
a legal and equitable interest, of which he would not be divested by the Government by any rules of law or equity.' No
power, certainly, was given by the colonization law of 1824,
authorizing the Governor to grant by way of sale, under any
circumstances. If,therefore, he does not possess the power
independently of that law, it exists nowhere, and a money consideration -need not to have been referred to the U. S. Supreme
Court to illustrate the equities of parties applying for a confirmation of their grants.
"In the Cambuston case, (20 How., 4,) they assign as a reason
for a strict interpretation of the claimant's grant, and its want
of equity, that there had been no pecuniary consideration paid.
In Fremont's case, (17 How., 558,) they refer to the fact that
the grant was given for meritorious and patriotic services, and
should place the claimant on a footing with one who had pur-

chased with money, and thus give a just and equitable claim
against the Government, the title to which in a court of equity
would be firm and valid.
"No sale, it would seem, for any amount of money, could
be legal so as to pass a title, if it be conceded that no power
on the part of the Governor to make a grant of the kind existed. It does appear to me, that when the Supreme Court
refers to the money consideration of a grant as vesting in the
holder of it a superior equity, by so doing they have at least
not decided that the Governor's act was void.
"They must have acted under the impression that the power
to sell in good faith was in the Governor, or that the equity of
the case was such as gave 'a just and equitable claim againsf
the Government,' the title to which in , court of equity would
be 'firm and valid.' In either view, but especially on the
ground of a power in the Governors of California, apart from
the colonization law, to aid in good faith, by a sale of laud,
the public necessities, this court considers that a decree affirming that of the board of Land Commissioners in this case must
be entered."
The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Catron, Mr. Justice Clifford,
and Mr. Justice Swayne, concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nelson.
Decree of the District Court reversed and record remitted, wilh a
mandate ordering that the claimant's petition be dismissed.
