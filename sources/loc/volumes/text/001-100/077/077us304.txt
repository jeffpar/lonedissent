GUNNELJL v. BIRD.

[Sup; Ct.

Statement of the case.

GUNNELL V. BIRD.
1. In stating partnership accounts, where one partner has had entire
charge of the business, he is to be debited with the whole capital placed
in his hands, as well as with the proceeds of sales realized by him.
2. If part of the capital consisted of stock, which has been used in the business, or disposed of and the proceeds charged against him, he should be
credited with such stock as a disbursement, to the amount at which it
was originally charged against him.
8. An allegation in an answer entirely impertinent to the bill cannot be
used as evidence for the defendant, even though the plaintiff neglect to
file a replication.
APPEALS from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia; the case, as clearly proved, or admitted by the parties, being thus:
On the 1st of May, 1845, Gunnell on one side and Bird
and Hepburn on the other, entered into copartnership in
the lumber business as equal partners, entitled to an equal
share of the profits. Gunnell was the active partner, and
put in, as his part of the capital, a stock of lumber valued
at $6627.56, and Bird and Hepburn put in $7775.65 in
cash, making a joint capital of $14,403.21. The business
was carried on for four years, during which period the gross
amount of 'sales was $93,471.11, and the disbursements
were, for lumber purchased of others, $55,146,55; for genera] expenses, $12,242.95; for lime, $732.18; and for rent,
not contained in the other accounts, $111, making a total
of $68,232.68. At the termination of the partnership the
stock on hand, books, and unsettled hccounts, were turned
over by Gunnell to Bird and Hepburn, who collected
$7775.68 (including what they had previously received),
and retained in hand bad and uncollected debts to the
amount, in 1852, when, as hereafter mentioned, the case
came before the auditor, of $5461.56.
The parties were unable to agree upon a settlement of the
partnership accounts, and Bird and Hepburn filed their bill
in August, 1850, against Gunnell to obtain an adjustment.
After answer an auditor was appointed, who reported in

Dec. 1869.]

GUNNELL V. BrRD.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Both the complainants having died, a bill of rovivor was'
afterwards filed; a pure bill of revivor, stating only the facts
nedessary to have the cause revived, and the proceedings
continued from the point reached when the complainants
died, and concluding with the prayer for a writ to the defendant to show cause why the suit should not be revived.
Rule No. 50, regulating equity proccedings, provides in
such case that if no cause to the contrary be shown by next
rule-day, "the suit shall stand revived, as of course." The
subponra was served in June, 1859. No answer was made
by the defeiidant until October following, and so the suit
stood revived on the first Monday of August at latest.
Then the defendant, in October, filed an answer to the
bill of reviver, admitting the facts stated in the bill, but
going on to state new matter as to the conduct of the complainants in regard to the books, &c., and setting up that
Bird aud Hepburn should be charged with all the bad and
uncollected debts, because by the use of due diligence they
could have collected therui, but had failed to do so.
To this aiswer no replicalion was put in. The matter being
referred again to the auditor, he simply affirmed his old
report.
Exceptions were taken to the report by both parties, but
it was confirmed by the special term of the court, whose decision was affirmed by the general term. From that decision an appeal was taken to this court, and the question
now.before this court was, whether the auditor's report was
correct.

Mr. .. Il.Bradley, in support of it.
Jlessrs. Carlisle and McPherson, contra.
Mr. Justice :BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the
court.
The opinion of the court is that the auditor committed
an error, and we should refer the cause back for a further
report if we deemed it necessary to do so; but the facts are
confined within such narrow limits, and are so clearly ascer-

tained by the proofs and admissions of the parties before
the auditor, that we deem it a useless formality.
The error of the auditor consists inl not charging Gunnell
with the capital contributed by the partners and placed in
his hands, and not crediting him with the cost of the lumber
originally contributed by himself.

On the other hand, it is equally plain that he should be

the proceeds instead.

The original capital had been increased to this sum, and
had the assets all been good, there would have been a clear
profit of $18,610.87. But the bad and uncollected debts
being deducted, the profit is reduced to $13,149.31; onehalf of which, besides his or their original capital, belonged

COOPER V. REYNOLDS.

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

There remains to be adjusted a question of interest due
to Bird and Hepburn for having contributed more capital
than Gunnell whilst the business was being carried on. The
auditor makes this interest $183.52, one-half of which should
be deducted-from the share of Gunnell, and added to that
of Bird and Hepburn. This would reduce the former to
$13,110.45, and raise the latter to $14,442.07.
Now the books show that Bird and Hepburn drew and
collected only $7552.68. This left a balance still due them
of $6889.39 to be accounted for by Gunnell.
In this account neither party is charged with the bad and
uncollected debts. They are simply deducted from the
profits, and the loss is thus equally divided. It is claimed
by the defendant that Bird and Hepburn should be charged
with the whole of this loss because they had the securities
and failed to collect them, when, by the use of due diligence,
they might have done it. This fact does. not appear in the
case except by the unsupported allegation of the defendant,
made in his answer to the bill of revivor This portion of
the answer was entirely impertinent to the bill, which was
strictly and purely a bill of revivor. No formal replication
was required to avoid its effect as evidence in the cause.
The result is that the complainants are entitled to a decree
against the defendant for the sum of $6889.39, with interest
from the 1st day of May, 1849, and costs. The decree of
the District Court must be REVERSED, and a decree rendered
FOR THE COMPLAINANTS ACCORDINGLY.

COOPER

v.

REYNOLDS.

1. It is an axiom of the law that when a judgment of a court is offered in
evidence collaterally in another suit, its validity cannot be questioned

for errors which do not affect the jurisdiction of the court that, rendered it.
2. Proceedings to enforce a debt or demand by attachment of the defendant's property partake of the character of suits, both in rem and in
personam.
