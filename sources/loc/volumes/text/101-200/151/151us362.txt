OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

UNITED STATES v. ALGER.
APPEAL FROM THE COUeT OF CLAIMS.
No. 885.

Submitted January 8,1894.-Decided January 22, 1894.

Under the act of March 3, 1883, c. 97, 22 Stat. 473, an officer in the Navy,
who resigns one office the day before his appointment to a higher one,
is only entitled to longevity pay as of the lowest grade, having graduated
pay, held by him since he originally entered the service.

THIs was a claim by a professor of mathematics in the
Navy for $32.87, alleged to be due him for longevity pay
from November 11, 1890, to November 30, inclusive. The
petition alleged that during that period he had been allowed
and paid at the rate of $2400 per annum, being the shore pay
of a professor of mathematics in the first five years after the
date of appointment; whereas, as he contended, he should
have been paid at the rate of $3000 per annum, being the pay
of a professor of mathematics in the third five years from the
date of appointment, by reason of his prior service in the Navy
from September 22, 1876, to November 10, 1890, by virtue
of the provision of the Naval Appropriation Act of March 3,
1883, c. 97, which is as follows:
"And all officers of the Navy shall be credited with the
actual time they may have served as officers or enlisted men
in the regular or volunteer Army or Navy, or both, and shall
receive all the benefits of such actual service in all respects
in the same manner as if all said service had been continuous
and in the regular 'Navy in the lowest grade, having graduated
pay, held by such officer since last entering the service:
Provided, that nothing in this clause shall be so construed
as to authorize any change in the dates of commission or in
the relative rank of such officers: Provided further, that
nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to give any
additional pay to any such officer during the time of his
service in the volunteer Army or Navy." 22 Stat. 173.
The petition also alleged, and the Court of Claims found,

Opinion of the Court.

the following facts: "Claimant was appointed cadet midshipman September 22, 1876; graduated June 22, 1882, and
promoted to midshipman the same day; commissioned ensign
June 26, 1884. Resigned November 10, 1890, and resignation
accepted to take effect the same day. November 11, 1890,
appoiuted professor of mathematics, to rank from November
1, 1890; accepted the appointment and took the required
oath of office the same day. He was given credit, upon his
commission as ensign, for his services as cadet midshipman,
and as a midshipman, and was paid the pay of an ensign after
five years of service, from June 26, 1884, to the date of his
resignation. He has not been allowed credit under* the act
of March 3, 1883, in the lowest grade, having graduated pay,
since be entered the Navy as professor of mathematics by
appointment as aforesaid."
Upon these facts, the Court of Claims decided, as a conclusion of law, that the claimant was entitled to recover the
sum claimed, and gave judgment accordingly. The United
States appealed to this court.

JUSTICE GRAY,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The theory of longevity pay was well stated by Chief Justice Drake, speaking for the Court of Claims, in an opinion
cited by both parties in this case, in which he said: "There
was, no doubt, an underlying principle and purpose in the introduction of longevity pay into the Navy. We think it was
intended, first, to induce men to enter the Navy and remain in
it for life ;. second, to remove the depressing influence of long
periods of service in one grade without an increase of pay ;
third, to compensate for increased professional knowledge
and efficiency in officers by increasing their pay in advance of

promotion. If these views are correct, the whole basis of longevity pay is the. officer's capacity for duty, and his performance of it. In other words, longevity pay is for longevity in
actual service." Tkornley v. United States, 18 0. C1. 111, 117.
Accordingly, a retired officer is not entitled to have active
service credited in regulating his pay after his active service
has ceased. Tkornley v. United States, 113 U. S. 310, and 18
C. Cl. 111; .Roget v. United States, 148 U. S. 167, and 21 C.
01. 165.
But every officer in active service is entitled, by the Naval
Appropriation Act of March 3, 1883, c. 97, to be credited with
the time of his actual service in the Navy in any grade, "as if
all said service had been continuous and in the regular Navy
in the lowest grade, having graduated pay, held by such officer
since last entering the service." 22 Stat. 473.
The whole aim and scope of the act are to give the officer,
in the grade held by him after its passage, the benefit of the
whole time of his actual service, and to fix the rate of increased compensation by the lowest grade, having graduated
pay, held by him "since last entering the service." Barton v.
United States, 129 U. S. 249, and 23 C. C1. 376; United States
v. Foster,128 U. S. 435. The act is as applicable to those
officers whose actual service has been continuous, as to those
who have actually served at two or more distinct periods. If
an officer has been twice in the service, the grade, the pay of
which is the test of computation, is the lowest held by him
since entering the service for the second time. United States
v. Rockwell, 120 U. S. 60, and 21 C. Cl. 332. But if he has entered the service but once, his first entry is to be taken as his
last entry, within the meaning of the statute. United States
v. Xullan, 123 U. S. 186; United States v. Green, 138 U. S.
293.
By section 1556 of the Revised Statutes, fixing the rate of
pay of officers in the Navy, the pay of cadet midshipmen or
of midshipmen is not graduated by length of service; but the
pay of ensigns, as well as of professors of mathematics, is so
graduated.
This claimant was continuously in active service from Sep-

Opinion of the Court.

tember 22, 1876, to November 10, 1890, first as cadet midshipman, then as midshipman, then as ensign. On November 10,
1890, he resigned the office of ensign, and his resignation was
accepted to take effect on the same day. On the next day,
November 11, he was appointed professor of mathematics, to
rank from November 1, and immediately accepted the appointment and took the oath of office.
There is no doubt that the time, with which he is to be
credited, began on September 22, 18'16, the date of his appointment as a cadet midshipman. United States v. Hendee, 124
U. S. 309; United States v. Baker, 125 U. S. 646; United
States v. Cook, 128 U. S. 254.
The controverted question is as to the grade, by which his
longevity pay as a professor of mathematics is to be computed;
and this depends upon the question whether the date of his
"last entering the service" is the date of his appointment as
professor of mathematics, in which case the pay of that office
is the test; or the date of his original appointment as cadet
midshipman, in which case the test is the pay of an ensign,
that having been his lowest grade with graduated pay. The
question is, in short, whether his actual service was for two
distinct periods, or for a single and continuous period of time.
This court is of opinion that, in substance and in law, it was
for one continuous period. His express resignation of the
lower office, the very day before his appointment to the higher
office, and when he must have known of and counted upon
the coming appointment, was evidently tendered with no intention of leaving the service, and was but equivalent to the resignation which the law would have implied from his acceptance
of the higher office. The fact is therefore immaterial (which
might otherwise be significant) that his new appointment was
to rank from a date before his resignation of the old one. If
such a formal resignation were sent in for the purpose of
eluding the statute and claiming longevity pay on the higher
scale, the attempt would be as unbecoming in the officer or
his advisers, as it would be ineffectual to charge the United
States.
The result is that the longevity pay to which the claimant

is entitled since his appointment as professor of mathematics
(as before this appointment) is that.of ensign only, that having
been "the lowest grade, having graduated pay, held by such
officer since last entering the service," within the meaning of
the statute.
Judgment reversed, and case remandedforfurtherproceedings in conformity with this opinion.

-UNITED STATES v. STAHlL.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 886. Submitted January 8, 1894.-

Decided January 22, 1894.

United States v. Alger, ante, 362, followed.
In a suit in the Court of Claims for longevity pay, alleged by the claimant,
and denied by the United States, to be due him, "after deducting all just
credits and offsets," a sum previously paid him for longevity pay to which
he was not entitled may be deducted from the sum found to be due him.

THIS was a claim for $1000, alleged to be due for longevity
pay as an assistant engineer in the Navy from June 10, 1882,
to August 10, 1887. The petitioner alleged that he was entitled
to this amount, "after deducting all just credits and offsets."
The answer was a general traverse.
The findings of fact by the Court of Claims were as follows:
"Claimant entered the Naval Academy, September 14, 1816;
graduated June 10, 1880; and was commissioned assistant
engineer June 10, 1882. On August 10, 1887, he resigned his
commission as assistant engineer. On August 11, 1887, he
was duly appointed and commissioned an assistant naval constructor. Claimant has never received any credit upon his
commission as assistant engineer for his service in the Navy
from his entry into the Naval Academy, September 14, 1876,
till the date of his said commission, June 10, 1882. On
December 30, 1888, claimant was given credit, for his prior
service at the Naval Academy and as assistant engineer, upon
the commission then held by him of assistant naval constructor.
The amount due claimant' is $1000, as unpaid longevity pay."
