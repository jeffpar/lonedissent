OCTOBER TERAI, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

The decision of the Supreme Court reversed the lower court,
which had proceeded exactly upon the same theory adopted
by the Circuit Court in the case under consideration. The
principles laid down in this and the other cases cited clearly
establish that the general instruction to the jury complained
of in the present case was erroneous.
Judgment reversed and case remanded with instructions to
set aside the verdict and to order a new trial.

Opinion of the Court.

1889, entitled "An act to provide a system of taxation of
railroad property in each of the counties of this State through
which said railroads run, and to provide a mode of assessing
and collecting the same, and for other purposes," Laws of
Georgia, 1889, No. 399, p. 29, violates that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
which declares that "no State shall deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws."
The act complained of provides as follows:
"SECriN I. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of this
State, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same, That
hereafter in each and every year, on or before the first day of
May, each and every railroad company in this State shall
make an annual return to the comptroller-general of this
State, for the purposes of county taxation in each of the counties through which said road runs, in the following manner:
Said return shall be under the oath of the president or other
chief executive officer, and shall show the following facts as
they existed on the first day of April preceding, to wit: First,
showing the aggregate value of the whole property of said
railroad company; second, showing the value of the real
estate and track bed of said company; third, showing the
value of the rolling stock and all other personal property of
said company; fourth, showing the value of the company's
property in each county through which it runs.
"SEC. II. Be it further enacted, etc., That, whenever the
amount of the tax levy of any county through which the said
railroad runs is assessed by the authority of such county, it
shall be the duty of the ordinary thereof to certify the same
and transmit such certificate to the comptroller-general; and
the property of such railroad companies shall be subject to
taxation in each and every county through which the same
passes to the same extent and in the same manner that all
other property is taxed, in the manner hereafter set out.
"SEc. III. Be itfurther enacted, etc., That, whenever such
certificate is received by the comptroller-general, it shall be
his duty to proceed to assess the amount of each and every
railroad company's property, in each and every of said coun-

ties, in the following manner: First, it shall be assessed upon
the property located in each- county upon the basis of the
value given by the returns required by section first of this
act; second, the amount of tax to be assessed upon the rolling stock and other personal property is as follows: As the
value of the property located in the particular county is to
the value of the whole property, real and personal, of the
said company, such shall be amount of rolling stock and other
personal property to be distributed for taxing purposes to
each county. These two, the value of the property located
in the county and the share of the rolling stock and personal
property thus ascertained and apportioned to each of such
counties, shall be the amount to be taxed to the extent of the
assessment in each county.
"SEc. IV. Be itfurtherenacted, That should the property
of any railroad company in this State be not subject to taxation, as hereinbefore provided, but taxable upon its net income,
such railroad company shall report to the comptroller-general
the entire length of its road, the different counties through
which such road runs, and the number of miles in each county,
which report shall be made at the time that railroad companies are required to return their property for taxation.
When the income of such road is returned to the comptrollergeneral, he shall estimate the amount of income for each
county through which such road runs, upon which shall be
levied for such county a tax to be ascertained in the following
manner: In the proportion that the road in each county bears
to the whole length of the road, in that proportion shall the
income returned by said road be taxed by each county through
which it passes. Such income shall be taxed at the rate fixed
by the charter of such railroad company, which tax shall be
assessed and collected by the comptroller-general, and by him
paid over to the county entitled to such tax. If any railroad
company refuses to pay such tax, the comptroller shall issue
execution for the amount of said tax due to each county,
which shall be levied on any property of said company. The
railroad company may resist such tax as is herein provided in
case of tax on property of railroad companies.

Opinion of the Court.
"SEC. V. Be it further enacted, etc., That whenever the
comptroller-general shall ascertain and levy in the manner
specified in the preceding section, the amount of tax due by
such company to each of such counties, it shall be his duty
at once to notify the president and treasurer of such railroad
company of the amount due in each of said counties for
county taxes of said railroads, and each and every road is
hereby required, within sixty days from the receipt of such
notice, to pay to the tax collector of each county through
which the railroad runs the amount mentioned by the comptroller-general, as the tax due to such county.
"SEC. VI. Be it further enacted, etc., If any railroad company shall refuse to pay, within sixty days, the amount thus
ascertained and due by it, to the tax collector of any county
to which the same is due and payable, it shall be the duty
of the comptroller-general to at once issue a ft. fa. in the
name of the State of Georgia, against such railroad company,
for the same; to be issued, levied, and returned in the same
manner as tax ft. fas. are issued for state taxes due in the
State by said companies.
"SEC. VII. Be itfurther enacted, etc., If any railroad company shall dispute the liability to such county tax, it may be
done by an affidavit of illegality, to be made by the president
of said railroad in the same manner as other affidavits of
illegality are made, and shall be returned for trial to the
Superior Court of the county of Fulton, where such cases
shall be given precedence for trial over all other cases, except
tax cases, in which the State shall be a party.
"SEC. VIII. Be it further enacted, etc., That all laws and
parts of laws in conflict with this act be, and the same are
hereby, repealed."
By an act approved in 1874,"(Act of February 28, 1874,
No. 107, p. 109, Laws of 1874,) provision was made for the
taxation of railroad property for state purposes, but this act
of 1889 was the first statute enacted providing for the taxation of railroad property for county purposes.
The plaintiff in error is a.corporation organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Georgia, having its principal

office or domicil in the city of Columbus, Muscogee County,
in that State, with its line of railway extending through the
counties of Chattahoochee, Stewart, Terrell, Webster, and
Lee, to the city of Albany in the county of Dougherty.
With the exception of its right of way, road-bed, superstructure, depots, and usual appurtenances along the line of
its road, the undistributed property of the corporation, such
as its choses in action, etc., is situated in Muscogee County.
Under the provisions of the first section of the act set out
above, the railroad company made return of its property for
the year 1890. Upon the basis of that return the comptrollergeneral of the State assessed and levied taxes for the benefit
of the several counties through which the railroad extended,
(after such counties had certified to him their respective tax
rate and levies,) and on October 27, 1890, notified the company that the taxes so levied must be paid to the respective
tax collectors of the several counties within sixty days from
the date of that notice.
The tax rate upon the property thus assessed, as stated in
the notice of the comptroller-general, was different in the
different counties. For Muscogee County it was 2- mills;
for Chattahoochee it was 8 mills ; for Stewart it was 5 mills ;
for Terrell it was 5.34 mills; and for Webster County it was
3.47 mills, these rates of taxation being imposed by the
respective counties on other property situate therein, and
subject to taxation.
Before the expiration of the sixty days, within which the
railroad company was required to make payment of the taxes
thus assessed, it filed its bill, or equitable petition, in the Superior Court of Fulton County against William A. Wright,
comptroller-general, for an injunction and relief against the
payment of these county taxes.
In the petition it was alleged that the act was repugnant
to the constitution of the State of Georgia, for various reasons: First, that it was inconsistent with that provision of the
constitution which required that "all taxation shall be uniform
upon the same class of subjects and ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits of the

COLUMBUS SOUTHERN RAILWAY v. WRIGHT.

475

Opinion of the Court.

authority levying the tax;" second, that the act was a special
one, whereas the constitution required that all taxes should be
levied and collected under general laws; third, that the act
provided for a tax to be levied and collected by the State for
the benefit of the counties, when the State had no authority
under the constitution to tax for such a purpose; fourth, that
the act embraced two subjects-matter, viz., the "property of
certain railroads," and also the "net incomes as to certain
other railroads," while the constitution declares that "no law
or ordinance shall pass which refers to more than one subjectmatter;" fifth, because the affidavit of illegality which a railroad company was authorized to file against an execution to
collect the taxes authorized by the statute was required to be
filed and tried in the Superior Court of Fulton County without reference to the domicil of the company, thereby conferring upon that court a greater jurisdiction than the constitution
allowed; and, sixth, that the act violated the Constitution of
the United States, in that it conflicts with the clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, which declares that "no State shall
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of its laws."
The defendant interposed a general demurrer to the petition, which the Superior Court of Fulton County sustained,
and dismissed the petition, holding that the act was not repugnant to the provisions of either the State or the Federal
Constitutions in any of the respects alleged. From that judgment the railroad company prosecuted a writ of error to the
Supreme Court of the State, which court fully reviewed and
considered the questions, and in affirming the judgment of
the court below held that the act of 1889 in no way violated
the constitution of the State and in no way discriminated
against the railway company so as to deny it the equal protection of the laws, and was not, therefore, repugnant to the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. 89 Georgia, 574. The present writ of error was sued
out to reverse this judgment.
Upon this writ of error we cannot, of course, review the
construction which the Supreme Court of the State has placed

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

upon its own constitution and the act in question. The Federal question sought to be raised by the plaintiff in error is
embodied in the two general propositions that "the rolling
stock and other unlocated personal property owned by the
railway company. is, by the provisions of the act, distributed
for taxation purposes to and for the benefit of the several
counties traversed by the railroad, while personal property of
all other persons and companies is taxed in and by the county
in which the owner resides; and, secondly, that the unlocated,
intangible personal property of railroad companies is distributed for taxing purposes to the several counties, while the
intangible personal property of all other persons follows the
domicil of the owner, and is there taxable."
These two objections embody substantially the single
proposition that the act in question discriminated against the
railroad company in not taxing its unlocated or intangible
personal property at the place of the railroad company's
domicil or principal office; in other words, in the county of
Muscogee. This proposition was disposed of by the Supreme
Court of the State as follows, pp. 593-595:
"The next objection made by the petition is that the requirement of the constitution as to uniformity in taxation is
violated, because certain personal property of railroads is
taxed for the benefit of counties, though not situated therein,
while as to other corporations and individuals county taxation
is imposed, so far as any particular county is concerned, only
on property within its territorial limits. This objection is
disposed of by what has already been said. We have shown
that in each county its rate of taxation is applied to the property of the railroad actually located therein, and that it is
perfectly just and proper to distribute the unlocated personalty of the road for taxing purposes in fair proportion
among the several counties, the corporation residing 8ub modo
in all the counties along its line of road, and therefore in one
as much as in another.
"In the next place, it is contended that the same paragraph
of the constitution is violated because the act prescribes a
different rate of taxation in each of the several counties through

COLUMBUS SOUTHERN RAILWAY v. WRIGHT.

477

Opinion of the Court.

which a railroad passes. The obvious answer to this objection
is that the act does not thus impose any tax substantially
different from the county taxes imposed on all other taxpayers. Certainly it does not, in any view of the question,
impose any tax for state purposes. It merely provides a
means for the county to apply to railroad property its own
rate of taxation and collect the tax for county purposes. The
vital thing is the rate, and the State has nothing to do with
fixing it in any county beyond general regulations restricting
its amount and the like. It is entirely immaterial whether
mere ministerial acts and calculations, which when correctly
done and made can have but one possible result, are the work
of the comptroller-general or of the county authorities. If
the act provides, as we think it does, a constitutional scheme
of taxation, what possible difference can it make whether the
amounts upon which taxes are to be paid are arrived at by
one officer or another, such amounts being necessarily the
same in either event? As the tax is for the exclusive benefit
of the county, and it fixes the rate, it is a county tax, and so
long as a county taxes all property within its jurisdiction ad
valorem and at the same rate, the uniformity required by the
constitution is observed, and this is true no matter what functionary acting by law for the county does the necessary ministerial acts. The question is all the more free from difficulty
because under our system each taxpayer values his own property for taxation and makes his own returns. So under the
present law the railroad can and does make returns to the
comptroller-general, which serve the same purpose as if it
made separate returns to the tax receivers. It fixes the
amounts on which it must pay taxes, and each county fixes
its own rate. Hence under this law a railroad would not
have to pay more tax than if each county by its own officials
attended to the whole business. Not being therefore really
injured, the railroads have in this respect no ground of complaint. Indeed, uder this law these corporations have one
advantage over other taxpayers. Returns made to tax receivers are overlooked by the grand juries, and a system is
provided for increasing the valuation of a taxpayer's property

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

when he undervalues it. Code, §§ 923 (b) et 8eq. No such
rule is applied to railroads by this act, but their returns stand
as they make them, whatever may be the law as to their
returns for state taxation. We will only add that as the act
allows corporations, whose property is taxable under it, to
designate in their returns what part of their property (real
and personal) is located in a particular county, there is no
ground for the complaint that the law may subject property
located in one county to the rate of taxation prescribed by
some other county. If, for example, the plaintiff in error
returns a switch engine as a part of its property located in
i iuscogee county, it will be taxed at the rate prescribed by
the authorities of that county, and none other."
This decision of the Supreme Court of the State establishes,
what is conceded by plaintiff in error, that the rate of taxation and the mode of valuing the railroad property for assessment was in all respects the same as the rate and mode prescribed for other taxpayers. S', that, the only difference
between the county taxation upon railroad property, real and
personal, and that of other persons or companies consisted in
the method of distributing the transitory or unlocated personal property of the railroad company, as valued by itself,
among the several counties entitled to share therein, for the
purposes of taxation. In other words, the question is whether
the railroad company has any constitutional right to have its
transitory property assessed for taxation alone in Muscogee
County, and whether the distribution, among the several
counties, of such property is such a discrimination against
the railroad as denies to it the equal protection of the laws ?
This is hardly an open question. Various modes of taxing
railroad property are adopted by the different States. In
some, railroad companies are taxed upon their property as a
unit. In others, the road and the property in each county are
separately assessed, and in still other States, the whole road
is assessed, and then the assessment apportioned among the
several counties and towns. These and all similar modes of
taxation are subject to the legislative discretion of the respective States, and do not ordinarily present any Federal question

COLUMBUS SOUTHERN RAILWAY v. WRIGHT.

479

Opinion of the Court.

whatever. But the mode of distribution of the unlocated or
transitory personal property is a matter of regulation by the
state legislature, which in no way involves a violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
In Hansas City &c. Railroadv. Severance, 55 Xissouri, 378,
388, the Supreme Court of Missouri, in dealing with this question, said: "The proposition is undoubtedly true, that where
a corporation has its residence, there the property of this description is liable to assessment and taxation if the law has
prescribed no different rule on the subject. This notion of
the situs of personal property following the personal residence
of the corporation is a legal fiction, but is not an unbending
and uncontrollable principle of law. It may be modified by
the legislature. The rolling stock of a railroad company has
no more local existence in one county than another.
This machinery by which the road is operated is constantly
passing from one terminus to the other of the entire road,
and to save all cavil and dispute in respect to it, it was perfectly
competent for the legislature to say that it should become a
part of the road itself and become property the same as the
road, and that for the purpose of taxation it should be equally
distributed through the counties, cities, or towns through
which it passed in proportion to its length in these respective
localities."
The principle here announced is repeated in the well-considered case of .F'an~din County v. Railroad Co., 12 Lea,
(Tenn.,) 521, 537, 538, 539, which involved substantially the
same question of the situs for the purpose of taxation of the
rolling stock and personal property of railway companies. It
was there said by the Supreme Court of Tennessee: "The
property of a railroad company for purposes of taxation consists of its realty, its local personalty, its rolling stock, its
choses in action, and its franchise. The franchise is the privilege conferred by the charter of incorporation, namely, the
right to exercise all the powers granted in the mode prescribed
for the purpose of profit. It is a unit, not confined to any
-one county in which it may be exercised. The principal part
.of the franchise is the right to charge for freight and pas-

Opinion of the Court.

sengers, the charge being limited within a prescribed or reasonable rate for carriage in the proportion of the distance of
transportation. Obviously, after ascertaining the value of the
entire franchise in the State as a unit, no more approximate
or just division of this value can be made for purposes of
taxation than to allot it among the counties through which
the track runs in the proportion of the length of track in the
county to the entire length of road in the State. And this is
what was done by the acts under consideration. The choses
in action of a corporation, its rolling stock, and personal property, according to the principles of the common law, have
their situs at the domicil or place of business of the company.

The rolling stock of a corporation,

used in transporting passengers and freight over any and all
parts of its line of road, cannot be said to have a situs which
would give a preference to any county through which the road
may run over any other county in like situation. The choses
in action of a railroad company, created by the exercise of its
franchises, on every part of its track, may be equally said to
be without a situs so as to give a preference. The legislature
might well treat them as the franchise itself, for, or by, the
exercise of which they are created, and proportion the general
valuation among the counties through which the road may
run according to the length of road in each county. The
roadway itself of a railroad depends for its value upon the
traffic of the company, and not merely upon the narrow strip
of land appropriated for the use of the road, and the bars
and cross-ties thereon. The value of the roadway at any
given time is not the original cost, nor, a fortiori,its ultimate
cost after years of expenditure in repairs and improvements.
On the other hand, its value cannot be determined by ascertaining the value of the land included in the roadway as-

COLUMBUS SOUTHERN RAILWAY v. WRIGHT.

481

Opinion of the Court.

sessed at the market price of adjacent lands, and adding the
value of the cross-ties, rails, and spikes. The value of land
depends largely upon the use to which .it can be put, and the
character of the improvements upon it. The assessable value,
for taxation, of a railroad track can only be determined by
looking at the elements on which the financial condition of
the company depends, its traffic, as evidenced by the rolling
stock and gross earnings in connection with its capital stock.
No local estimate of the fraction in one county of a railroad
track running through several counties can be based upon
sufficient data to make it at all reliable, unless, indeed, the local
assessors are furnished with the means of estimating the
whole road."
The principle set out in the above quoted authorities is
clearly sanctioned by this court in the State Railroad Tax
Oases, 99 U. S. 575, 607, where the same objection to the
system of taxation by the State, as here presented, was made
that the rolling stock, etc., was personal property, and that
it and other personal property had a situs at the principal
place of business of the corporation, and could be taxed in no
other county but the one where it was situated. This court
met that objection by saying: "It may be doubted very
reasonably whether such a rule can be applied to a railroad
corporation as between the different localities embraced by
its line of road. But, after all, the rule is merely the law of
the State which recognizes it. . . . Like all other laws
of a State, it is, therefore, subject to legislative repeal, modification, or limitation, and when the legislature of Illinois
declared that it should not prevail in assessing personal
property of railroad companies for taxation, it simply exercised an ordinary function of legislation. Whether allowing
the rule to stand as to taxation of individuals, and changing
it as to railroads or other corporations, it violated any rule
of uniformity prescribed by the constitution of the State, we
will consider when we come to the constitutional objections
to the statute."
In its further consideration of that case the court held that
changing the situs of such unlocated property of a railroad
VOL. CLI-31

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

company, and distributing it to the counties through which
the road extended, in no way violated the rule of uniformity
or discriminated against the railroad company. In that case,
as in this, there was no claim that the rate of taxation levied
by any county on the assessed value of the property within
its limits was greater than on other property; nor was the
valuation different from that placed upon other property.
In the present case the railroad company, like other property
owners, placed its own valuation upon the property. It was
also held, in the case just cited, that taxes are uniform when
the rate of taxation is the same on assessments ascertained
by the same method.
Without reviewing authorities on this subject, the principle
involved in the case under consideration is not distinguishable
from the principle involved in State Railroad Tax Cases, 92
U. S. 575; and in Ifentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S.
321, 339; .Xinneapolis & St. Louis Railway v. Beckwith, 129
U. S. 26; and in Charlotte, Columbia & Augusta Railroad v.
Gibbes, 142 U. S. 386.
The whole complaint made by the plaintiff in error is that
it had a constitutional right to have its rolling stock, and
other unlocated personal property, taxed in the county of
Muscogee, where it had its principal office, and to give such
property a different situs, under the act complained of, by
distributing it among the counties through which the road
extended, was an unjust discrimination, and violated its constitutional rights. This proposition cannot be entertained for
a moment, for the reason already stated, that it was clearly
within the province of the legislature of Georgia, to give such
personal property a different situs, for purposes of taxation,
from that of the company's principal office. The act in question having apportioned the transitory and unlocated property
of the railroad company among the several counties through
which the road extends for the purpose of taxation, and
having subjected such property to the same rate of taxation
imposed upon all other property in the respective counties,
the fact that the rate of taxation varied in the different
counties, according to their respective wants and necessities,

Statement of the Case.

involved no discrimination against the railroad company.
The State having the undoubted authority to fix the situs
of such property, and having lawfully distributed it proportionately between the several counties traversed by the
road, it thereby became subject to the same rate of taxation
as other property in the respective counties. This involved
no inequality, and violated no provision of either the state
or Federal Constitution. It certainly did not involve a failure
to extend to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the
laws.
