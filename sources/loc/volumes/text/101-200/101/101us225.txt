JONES v. CLIFTO1T.
1. Unless existing claims of creditors are thereby impaired, a voluntary settlement of property made by a husband upon his wife is not invalid.
2. The technical reasons of the common law arising from the unity of husband
and wife, which would prevent his conveying the property directly to her
for a valuable consideration, as upon a contract or purchase, have long
since ceased to operate in the case of his voluntary transfer of it as a settlement upon her.
3. The intervention of trustees, in order that the property may be held as her
separate estate beyond his control or interference, though formerly held to
be indispensable, is no longer required.
4. His reservation of a power of revocation or appointment to other uses does
notimpair the validity or efficiency of the conveyance in transferring the
property to her, to hold until such power shall be executed; nor does it
tend to create an imputation upon his good faith and honesty in the transaction.

MR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.,

This is a suit by Stephen E. Jones, assignee in bankruptcy
of Charles H. Clifton, to set aside two deeds executed by the
latter to his wife, and to compel a transfer of the property embraced in them to the complainant. Clifton married in 1870,
and was possessed at the time of a large estate. Previously to

his marriage he had taken out three policies of insurance on his
life, each for $10,000. Soon after his marriage he took out
two additional policies on his life, each for the same amount as
the previous ones. In October, 1872, by his deed-poll he conveyed to his wife, in consideration of the love and affection he
bore her, to hold as her separate estate, free from his control,
use, and benefit, a small parcel of land in the city of Louisville,
in the State of Kentucky, and by the same instrument, upon
the like consideration, and to be held for the same separate use
of his wife, he assigned to her the five policies of insurance on
his life. The deed contained a clause reserving to himself the
power to revoke the grant and assignment, in whole or in part,
and to transfer the property to any uses he might appoint, and
to such person or persons as he might designate, and to cause
such uses to spring or shift as he might declare.
In April, 1873, by another deed-poll he conveyed to his wife,
upon like consideration of love and affection, to hold as her
separate estate, free from his control, use, or benefit, two other
parcels of land; one consisting of a lot in the city of Louisville,
Kentucky, and the other his country place in the county of
Jefferson, in that State, comprising thirty-eight acres. The
instrument contained a reservation of a power of revocation
and appointment to other uses similar to that of the first deed,
the power of appointment, however, being somewhat fuller,
in providing for its execution either by deed or writing, to
take effect as a devise under the Statute of Wills in Kentucky.
These deeds were properly acknowledged and recorded in
the counties where the real property was situated. At the
time of their execution, the grantor was not in any business,
and did not intend engaging in any; was worth about $250,000,
and owed only a few inconsiderable debts, which were soon
afterwards paid. The deeds were made at the urgent solicitatioll of his wife, who perceived that his habits were those of an
indiscreet young man, somewhat inclined to dissipation, and
she was naturally desirous of providing against a possible waste
of his property.
In 1873, a general financial panic passed over the country;
the values of all kinds of property greatly depreciated in the

market, and land in the country could scarcely be disposed of
at any price. By the shrinkage in values and losses in the subsequent years of 1874 and 1875, by his being surety for others,
and by bad management, his estate was wasted, and he became
hopelessly insolvent. In December, 1875, upon his petition,
he was adjudged a bankrupt by the District Court of Kentucky.
The complainant was subsequently appointed assignee of his
effects, and received an assignment of his property. The proved
debts against him amounted to $13,000, and his estate in the
hands of the assignee was of little value.
The assignee seeks to set aside the deeds upon various
grounds, which, however, may be embraced in the following:
1st, Thdt they are void, because made directly to his wife, without the intervention of a trustee, and so passed no interest to
her; 2d, That, by the reservation to the grantor of a power of
revocation and appointment to other uses, they were designed
to hinder and defraud his future creditors, whilst he retained
the control and enjoyment of the property; and, 3d, That the
power of revocation and appointment were assets which passed
to the assignee in bankruptcy, and can be executed by him for
the benefit of creditors.
The questions thus presented, though interesting, are not
difficult of solution. The right of a husband to settle a portion
of his property upon his wife, and thus provide against the
vicissitudes of fortune, when this can be done without impairing existing claims of creditors, is indisputable. Its exercise is
upheld by the courts, as tending not only to the future comfort
and support of the wife, but also, through her, to the support
and education of any children of the marriage. It arises, as
said by Chief Justice Marshall in Sexton v. W-zeaton, as a consequence of that absolute power which a man possesses over
his own property, by which he can make any disposition of. it
which does not interfere with the existing rights of others. In
that case the husband had purchased a house and lot within
the District of Columbia, and taken the conveyance in the name
of his wife, and afterwards made improvements upon the property.. Subsequently he became involved in debt, and his creditors, having obtained a judgment against him, filed a bill to
subject this property to its payment, contending that the con-

JONES V. CLIFTON.

[Sup. Ct.

veyance to the wife was fraudulent and void as to them, and
praying that if the conveyance were upheld the wife might be
compelled to account for the value of the improvements. But
the court held, after an extended consideration of the authorities, that as the husband was at the time free from debt, the
conveyance was to be deemed a voluntary settlement upon her;
and as it was not made with any fraudulent intent, it was valid
against subsequent creditors; and that the improvements upon
the property stood upon the same footing as the conveyance, it
appearing that they had been made before the debts were contracted. 8 Wheat. 229. That case does not differ in principle
from the one before us. The husband in this, as in that one,
was free from debt when he made the deeds, which were voluntary settlements upon his wife. It cannot make any substantial difference that in the case cited the money of the
husband was expended in the purchase of the property, and the
conveyance was taken in the name of the wife; and that in
the present case the property was owned at the time by the
husband, and was transferred directly by him to her. The
transaction, in its essential features, would have been the same
as now, if the husband had sold his lands and invested the proceeds in other property and taken a conveyance in her name.
The circuity of the proceeding would not have altered its character nor affected its validity. In all cases where a husband
makes a voluntary settlement of any portion of his property for
the benefit of others who stand in such a relation to him as to
create an obligation, legal or moral, to provide for them, as in the
case of a wife, or children, or parents, the only question that can
properly be asked is, Does such a disposition of the property
deprive others of any existing claim to it? If it does not, no
one can complain if the transfer be made matter of public
record, and not be designed as a scheme to defraud future creditors. And it cannot make any difference through what channels the property passes to the party to be benefited, or to his
or her trustee, - whether it be by direct conveyance from the
husband, or through the intervention of others. The technical
reasons of the common law arising from the unity of husband
and wife, which would prevent a direct conveyance of the property from him to her for a valuable consideration, as upon a

contract or purchase, have long since ceased to operate in the
case of a voluntary transfer of property as a settlement upon'
her. The intervention of trustees, in order that the property
conveyed may be held as her separate estate beyond the control
or interference of her husband, though formerly held to be
indispensable, is no longer required. This has been established
in courts of equity, says Story, for more than a century, so
"that whenever real or personal property is given or devised
or settled upon a married woman, either before or after marriage, for her separate and exclusive use, without the intervention of trustees, the intention of the parties shall be effectuated
in equity, and the wife's interest protected against the marital
rights and claims of her husband, and of his creditors also."
Eq. Jur., sect. 1380. And he adds to this observation, that
"it will make no difference whether the separate estate be
derived from her husband himself or a mere stranger; for, as
to such separate estate, when obtained in either way, her husband will be treated as a mere trustee, and prohibited from
disposing of it to her prejudice." There is nothing in the circumstances attending the execution of the deeds in this case
which should prevent the full application of the doctrine stated
for the protection of the wife's interest against the claim of the
assignee for the benefit of the creditors of the husband. Lloyd
v. Fulton, 91 U. S. 485.
The powers of revocation and appointment to other uses
reserved to the husband in the deeds in question do not impair
their validity or their efficiency in transferring the estate to
the wife, to be held by her until such revocation or appointment be made. Indeed, such reservations are usual in family
settlements, and are intended "to meet the ever-varying interests of family connections." Biggs v. _Murray, 2 Johns. (N. Y.)
Ch. 565. So frequent is the necessity of a change in the uses
of property thus settled, arising from the altered condition of
the family, the addition or death of members, new occupations
or positions in life, and a variety of other causes which will
readily occur to every one, that the absence of a power of
revocation and of appointment to other uses in a deed of family
settlement has often been considered a badge of fraud, and,
except when made solely to guard against the extravagance and

JONES V. CLIFTON.

[Sup. Ct.

imprudence of the settler, such settlements have in many instances been annulled on that ground. Several of them are
cited in the very able and learned opinion of the district judge
who presided in the Circuit Court when this case was there
heard. The law in England, by which property can be kept in
the same families for many years, has, perhaps, caused greater
importance to be given in that country than in this to the
insertion in deeds of settlement of a power of revocation and
appointment to other uses. Here the absence of the reservation is only a fact to be explained, and is to have more or less
weight, according to the circumstances of each case. In the
case before us the husband does not appear to have had his
attention drawn to the reservation. He desired to have the
property settled upon his wife, and he intrusted the preparation of the deed to ,his counsel. There was clearly no fraudulent intent on his part; no proof of any such intent was
produced or stated to be in existence. The only fraud asserted
in argument to exist is constructive fraud arising from the
reservation in question. But its presence in the deed, as is
clear from all the authorities, does not tend to create an imputation upon his good faith and honesty in the transaction.

8 Eq. 558; Wollaston v. Tribe, 9 id. 44 ; Everitt v. Everitt, 10

Rep. 7 Ch. 244 ; Hall v. Hall, 8 id. 430 ; Toker v. Tolcer, 3 De
G., J. & S. 486.
As is very justly observed in the opinion of the court below,
the insertion of the power of revocation and new appointment,
so far from proving that the grantor contemplated a fraud upon
his future creditors, tends to show the contrary. Should he
revoke the settlements, the property would revert to him, and,
of course, be liable for his debts; and should he exercise the
power of appointment for the benefit of others, the estate
appointed would be liable in equity for his debts.
The title to the land and policies passed by the deeds; a
power only was reserved. That power is not an interest in the
property which can be transferred to another, or sold on execution, or devised by will. The grantor could, indeed, exercise
the power either by deed or will, but he could not vest the
