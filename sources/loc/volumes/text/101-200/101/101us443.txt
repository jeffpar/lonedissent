BROOKS v. RAILWAY CO.

The equitable doctrine upon which the appellants' claim is
founded undoubtedly obtains in Louisiana. It is derived from
the principles of the civil law, which is the basis of the civil
code of that State; and it is supported by the authorities cited
from the Louisiana reports. See Civil Code La., art. 1965; Williams v. Winchester, 7 Mart. N. s. (La.) 22; Citizen's Bank v.
-Dugui and Louisiana State Bank, 5 La. An. 12; Braden v.
Louisiana Insurance Co., 1 La. 220.
Our conclusion is, that the decree of the Circuit Court
should be reversed, and the case remanded with instructions
to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion; and it is
So ordered.

BRooKs v. RAILWAY Co~mANY.
1. Where a contractor performs labor and furnishes materials upon a section or
division of a railroad in Iowa then in the process of construction, and there
was a pre-existing and duly recorded mortgage executed by the company on
its entire line of road to secure its bonds, - Held, that on filing his claim
within the time, and in the mode prescribed by the statute, he has, as against
the mortgagees, a paramount lien upon the entire road.
2. A sub-contractor, between whom and the contractor a settlement had been
made and the balance ascertained, filed within the required time in the
clerk's office of tie proper court his claim in due form against the contractor
and the company, and, in a suit whereto they were all parties, judgment
establishing his lien on the road was rendered. In a foreclosure suit subsequently brought against the company and him, the mortgagees objected to
the validity of his lien because he had not also presented to the company
that settlement certified by the contractor to be just. Hdd, that the objection was not well taken.

Company on its road and other property to secure $1,800,000
of bonds put on the market and sold. They instituted this
foreclosure suit against the company, and brought in, during
its progress, other parties who were asserting mechanics' liens
on the road. Of these parties only the interest of O'Hara
Brothers and Wells, French, & Co., whose liens were by
the court held to be paramount to that of complainants, remain to be considered in the appeal of the trustees from that
decree.
The company was organized under the laws of Iowa to build
a railroad from Burlington, on the Mississippi River, in a southwestern direction to some point on the Missouri River. From
the initial point, at Burlington, to Viele, in Lee County, Iowa,
they by contract used the track of a road already built between
Burlington and Keokuk. From Viele to Bloomfield, in Davis
County, they built and paid for their own track. From Bloomfield to Moulton, in Appanoose County, fourteen miles, they
used the road of another company, already built, and from
Moulton to Unionville, in Missouri, they built their own road.
It is for the work and labor done and materials furnished on
the latter piece of the road that the lien of the appellees was
allowed by the court on the road and right of way, stations,
&c., of the company from Viele Junction, in Lee County, to
the South Iowa State line, in Appanoose County, in favor of
O'Hara Brothers for $39,763.24, and in favor of Wells, French,
& Co., for $8,528.83.
It is conceded that the work for which these liens were
allowed was done for the company by the parties claiming 'them,
and no question is raised here as to its value, or to the liability
of the company to pay for it. The fact is undisputed that before any of it was done, or the contract therefor made, the
mortgage to the complainants had been executed and duly
recorded.
It was also undisputed that both the appellees, whose claim
is now contested, were sub-contractors, and that the only contract which the railway company made for labor and materials
was with another organization, known as the Mississippi and
Missouri Construction Company.
This purely artificial being, composed of the officers and some

BROOKÂ§ V. RAILWAY CO.

of the stockholders of the railway company, was organized for
the purpose of building this road. It belongs to a class of corporations which have become well known of late years as instruments to enable the officers of railroad companies to make
contracts with themselves to build the roads for their stockholders. In the present case, this construction company having
sublet all the contract to one J. W. Barnes, very soon took itself
out of the way, and by an agreement between it and the railway company, of which the following extract is found in the
record, its existence ceases to be of any further significance in
this contest: "Contract between -B. & .TV. Railway Company and the .M.&
. Construction Company. Dated Feb. 6,1873.
"The railway company assumes all outstanding liabilities of the
construction company, except officers' salaries. All previous contracts between the two companies are annulled.
"The railway company assumes the contract of J. W. Barnes for
construction of portions of the main line and branch of the B. & S.
W. Railway Company, and the payment of all estimates due and to
become due thereon."
This leaves to be considered here the railway company, J. W.
Barnes, the principal contractor for construction of the road,
O'Hara Brothers, and Wells, French & Co., sub-contractors, and
the complainants. It is also to be observed that before the
present foreclosure suit was begun O'Hara Brothers and Wells,
French & Co. had both commenced legal proceedings in the
proper courts of the State, and had, after a contest with the
railway company, obtained judgments establishing their liens.
It was after this that they were made defendants to this suit.
To those proceedings, Barnes, the principal contractor, and
the railway company were parties, and we take it for granted
that as against them the judgments establish the validity of
the liens. The judgments do not bind the appellants as they
were not parties thereto. The validity of the liens as against
them, and if valid, their precedence to that of the mortgage,
are the questions for consideration here, and they must be
determined by applying the statutes of Iowa to the facts of
this case.

BROOKS V. RAILWAY Co.

[Sup. Ct.

By the law in force when these transactions took place a
mechanic has, for labor done or things furnished, a lien on the
entire land upon which the building, erection, or improvement
was made, which has been held to include railroads, and it shall
be preferred to all other liens and incumbrances which shall be
attached to or upon such building, erection, or other improvement made subsequently to the commencement of said building,
erection, or other improvement. Revision of 1860, sect. 1853;
Code of 1873, sect. 2139.
This provision, it will be observed, relates to the land on
which the improvement is made and gives the mechanic a paramount or preferred lien only as against other liens and incumbrances created subsequently to the beginning of his work.
Those made prior to that time are unaffected by it. But sect.
1855 of the Revision, now sect. 2141 of the Code, makes a different provision in regard to his lien on the building, erection,
and improvement for which the lien is claimed. It reads thus :"The lien for the things aforesaid on work shall attach to the
building, erections, or improvements for which they were furnished
or done, in preference to any prior lien or incumbrance or mortgage
upon the land upon which the same is erected or put, and any person enforcing such lien may have such building, erection, or other
improvement sold under execution, and the purchaser may remove
the same within a reasonable time thereafter.'
The mechanic, therefore, has a lien upon the land paramount
to all rights accruing after the commencement of his work, and
upon what he puts upon the land paramount to all other claims,
whether created before or after that time. The decisions of
the courts of Iowa are to this effect and the proposition is not
disputed in argument here.
Have the sub-contractors in this case taken the necessary
steps~to establish their lien?
What is required to initiate the lien as to all other persons
but sub-contractors is to be found in sect. 1851 of the Revision
of 1860.
"Sect. 1851. It shall be the duty of every person, except as has
been provided for sub-contractors, who wishes to avail himself of the
provisions of this chapter, to file with the clerk of the district court

Oct. 1879.]

BROOKS V. RAILWAY CO.

of the county in which the building, erection, or other improvement
to be charged with the lien is situated, and within ninety days after
all the things aforesaid shall have been furnished, or work or labor
done or performed, a just and true account of the demand due or
owing to him after allowing all credits, and containing a correct
description of the property to be charged with said lien and verified
by affidavit."
This section was subsequently modified by the following statute : -

"An act to amend sect. 1851 of -Revision of 1860, relating to
ifechanics' Liens.
"Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State
of Iowa, that the following words are hereby added to sect. 1851 of
Revision of 1860, to wit: 'But the failure to file the claim, account,
settlement, or demand, in the time named in this section and in sect.
1847, shall not operate to defeat the claim or demand, nor the lien of
the person supplying the labor or material, as against the owner,
nor the contractor, nor as against any one except purchasers or
incumbrancers, without notice, whose rights accrued after the ninety
days and before the account, or settlement, or claim, or lien is filed.'
"Approved April 7, 1862."
The statute, however, makes provision that a sub-contractor
who shall do the work which his principal had contracted to do
shall by proper proceeding secure to himself the lien which
arises from the work done or materials furnished. In such case
there is a more complex affair. There are here the owner of
the property, the principal contractor, and the sub-contractor,
who, as well as prior and subsequent incumbrancers or lien
holders, have rights to be affected. It may generally be supposed that the principal contractor has sublet his contract so as
to leave a profit to himself. He is entitled, therefore, to see
that his sub-contractor does not take this profit. The owner is
not bound for more than he agreed to pay the principal contractor. In view of these interests, sect. 1847 of the Revision,
sect. 2131 of the Code of 1873, enacts that every sub-contractor
wishing to avail himself of the benefit of the act, shall give
notice to the owner of the land, before or at the time he furnishes
any of the materials or performs any of the labor, of his inten-

BROOKS V. RAILWAY CO.

[Sup. Ct.

tion to perform or furnish the same, and afterwards he shall
settle with the contractor therefor, and having made the settlement in writing, the same, signed by the contractor and certified
by him to be just, shall be presented to the owner. He is also
required, within thirty days from the time the things shall
have been 'furnished or the labor performed, to file with the
clerk of the district court of the county in which the building
is situated a copy of said settlement, and a correct description
of the property to be charged with the lien, the correctness of
which shall be verified by oath. As we have already seen, the
act of 1862 declares that a failure to file this settlement shall not
operate to defeat the lien as against any one except purchasers
or incumbrancers without notice, whose rights accrued after
ninety days, and before the account or settlement or lien claim
is filed.
Appellants are not within this exception.
The record shows that there was filed in the office of the
clerk of the District Court of Appanoose County, on the 31st
of October, 1872, a statement by O'Hara Brothers of a claim
against J. W. Barnes, the principal contractor, and against the
railroad company, of a mechanic's lien on their line of said road,
from Viele, in Lee County, through Van Buren, Davis, and
Appanoose counties, in the State of Iowa, for work and labor
done and to be done and materials furnished under Barnes's
contract, in which they said they had already done work to the
amount of $265,000, of which $130,000 had been paid. This
was verified by the oath of O'Hara. An agreed statement of
facts in the present suit states that, in filing their respective
claims for mechanics' liens, settlements had been made between
the sub-contractors and Barnes, and that the amounts claimed
had been agreed to by Barnes in these several settlements.
It is now urged by appellants against the validity of these
liens that the notice of the lien to the railway company, which
the statute required from the sub-contractor, was never given,
and if any direct written notice was necessary to the establishment of the lien in this suit it must be admitted that it is not
0
proved.
But we think there are two sufficient answers to this objection: -

Oct. 1879.]

BROOKS V. RAILWAY CO.

1. It is obvious that this notice to the owner of the property
is for the purpose of enabling him to protect himself in his
dealings with the principal contractor, so that he shall neither
overpay the amount of the contract with the sub-contractor, nor
embarrass himself by having to deal with two contractors. This
dealing with two contractors instead of one being an obligation
which the law imposes on him for the benefit of the sub-contractor, this notice is required for his protection. It can have
nothing to do with the validity of the lien beyond ascertaining
the amount of it to which the sub-contractor is entitled as between
those three. With prior liens it has nothing to do, and can
have no effect on the rights of the holders of them. The initial
proceeding for the establishment of the lien, on which all others
rest, is the claim filed in the clerk's office of the proper court.
In the case of Bundy v. The K. & D. 1 1.. Co. (49 Iowa, 207),
the Supreme Court of the State held that the paper thus filed
by a sub-contractor imparted notice to the owner and principal
contractor of the condition of the account between the parties.
2. Since this notice is designed for the protection of the
owner, and was to be given to him, the judgment of the State
court of Iowa establishing this lien against the railroad company is conclusive on that subject, and with that question the
complainants in this court have nothing to do.
The next objection very strongly urged by counsel for
appellants is thus stated in the assignment of errors: The court
erred in decreeing a lien on the property in Davis, Van Buren,
and Lee counties, the first division of the road, for work done
in Appanoose County, the next division, on a contract which
was dated and work begun after recording the mortgage in the
latter county.
As we understand this objection, it is founded oi the idea
that while, if the whole road had been uninterruptedly built
under one contract, the lien of the contractors and sub-contractors would have been good against the whole road, though
they had contributed only to the building of a limited portion
of it, yet because these sub-contractors were only employed on
one division of the road, after another had been finished, and
under a distinct contract with the company made after that
completion, the lien can only attach to the last section of the
VOL. xI.

road, and even this is subordinate to the mortgage of the
appellants.
One branch of the question here raised was very fully considered in the case of Neilson v. Iowa -EastqrnRailway Company,
44 Iowa, 71. That was a case where, after the building of a
railroad had been commenced, a mortgage was executed on its
whole line, both where work had been done and where none
had been done. After this the building of the road was continued under new contracts by persons who did work on the
other parts of the road, and the question was whether they bad
any lien prior to that of the mortgage, and if so, whether it
extended to all the road or only to that part built under the
new contracts.
The court, after mature deliberation, decided both these
questions in favor of the contractors. It held that the road
was an entire improvement, within the meaning of the act, and
that the continuance of it was a matter to be taken into the
calculation of the mortgagees when the mortgage was made,
and the lien for that work was by the statute given on the road
as one improvement. The court, speaking of the policy of the
statute, said "it is not desirable that the execution of a mortgage upon land on which a building or other improvement is in
process of construction should arrest the work and prevent its
completion. Both mortgagor and mortgagee are interested in
its completion. Without it the money already expended must
ordinarily to a great extent be lost. Take the present case as
illustrative. The interveners are holders of mortgage bonds
upon a road, sixteen miles of which had been graded at the
time the mortgage was made. The value of their security
depended upon the further construction of the work. They
foresaw that work and materials must be furnished by somebody, or nothing could be realized from what had been done."
But the argument most confidently urged here is that the
road was built in sections, and that there was such a separation in space and time in the construction of them that they
cannot be considered as one improvement within the meaning
of the statute. The argument is that the road from Viele to
Bloomfield is one road; that then it is interrupted, and the
track of another company is used from Bloomfield to Moulton;

Oct. 1879.]

BROOKS V. RAILWAY

CO.

that there another road begins which was constructed under
another contract, and that no lien for work done here can
attach to the road between Viele and Bloomfield.
The argument seems to us extremely technical, and at war
with the principle in which liens are allowed for work done
subsequently to the creation of a mortgage. That doctrine,
or rather the statute which the courts construed as giving a
permanent lien under such circumstances, was in existence
when the mortgage of the appellants was made. It entered
into and became a part of their contract. They knew that the
road was yet to be built, and that while such building would
add to the value of their security, the law gave to the men
whose labor and money built it a lien superior to that of the
mortgage. Now that the venture in which both embarked is
to end in loss to one or the other of them, there is no judicial
propriety in straining the law to limit the rights of one party
rather than those of the other. If that law by its fair construction gives the mechanic a lien for a few thousand dollars on
the whole road, instead of a part of it, the law should prevail.
In every respect, except this one of its construction, the road
is a unit, an entirety. Its route is selected and surveyed as
one road. It is owned and built and run by one corporation.
Its trains run over it all. The mortgage of appellants can
have no lien on any of the road beyond the first few miles
upon any other theory, for its descriptive language refers to the
road as one and not as several subdivisions. It is not easy to
see how it can be held to be one road for the purposes of the
mortgage, and two or three pieces of road for the purposes of
the mechanics' lien. This continuation of the road beyond
Bloomfield was as useful to the security of that mortgage as
the part between Viele and Bloomfield. Though the work
was done from Moulton under another contract, there was
never any suspension of the work on the whole road beyond
what is usual in roads built with limited means. There was
never any permanent arrest of the work, nor any intention to
cease work on the road. The intersection of fourteen miles of
another road between Bloomfield and Moulton does not destroy
the identity of the improvement, nor convert it into two railroads.

BROOKS v. RAILWAY Co.

[Sup. Ot.

Canal Company v. Gordon (6 Wall. 561), is much relied on
by appellants, and in one of its features,- that now under
bears some analogy to this case. There,
consideration, -it
however, the part of the canal first finished, and which was
held not to be subject to a lien for work done on that constructed afterwards, had been in full operation for some time.
How long it had been finished and in use before work was
begun on the new part is not stated in the report of the case.
It may have been long enough to justify the belief that for a
time the further prosecution of the work was abandoned, and
its resumption an afterthought.
In the case before us the purpose of discontinuing the road
was never for a moment entertained, and the actual work was
resumed in a few months after its completion to Bloomfield. In
that case the decision depended on the construction of a statute
of California which used the word "structure" where the Iowa
statute uses the word "improvement."
In that case, as was said in the opinion, we had no aid from
any decision of the courts of the State. In the one before us
we have several decisions of the Iowa court. -eilson v. Iowa
Eastern Bailway Company, 44 Iowa, 71 ; BEquitable Life Insurance Company v. Slye, 45 id. 615.
"A mechanic's lien," says the court in the latter case, "can,
it is true, become paramount to a mortgage executed upon a
partially erected building, provided the work be done or materials furnished for the purpose of completing the building.
This is the plain provision of the statute, and, to our mind, it
is not unreasonable. Whoever takes a mortgage upon a building in the process of erection, should assume that the mechanics'
work is to go forward, and he may form some estimate of the
amount that will be required. The same is not true in regard
to repairs or enlargements."
If Canal Company v. Gordon, supra, is at variance with the
decision of the courts of Iowa construing her own statute, we
must follow the latter. They also meet our approval.
Without examining other objections to the decree, or those
to the lien of Wells, French, & Co., we think what we have
said covers the case.

Decree affirmed.
