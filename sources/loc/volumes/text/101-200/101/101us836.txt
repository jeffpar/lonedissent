WAITE delivered the opinion of the

court.
When this case was here before (94 U. S. 695), we affirmed
the decree then appealed from "with costs and interest until
paid at the same rate per annum that similar decrees bear in
the courts of the State of Illinois." In this way we established

the validity of the patent sued on, and directed the court below
to proceed with the collection of its money decree, with such
interest as similar decrees bear in the State. By "similar" we
meant decrees for the payment of money, and not decrees in
patent suits, for of such suits the State courts have no jurisdiction.
The courts of Illinois have uniformly held that money decrees carry interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, the
statutory rate for judgments. For this reason it was right for
the Circuit Court, when our mandate went down, to order that
the decree affirmed be executed by the collection of the money
found to be due, and interest, which, under the established rule
in the State, will be at six per cent.
-Decree affirmed.
