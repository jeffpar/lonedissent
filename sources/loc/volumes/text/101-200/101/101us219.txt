GAS CO. V. PITTSBURGH.

GAS COMPANY v. PITTSBURGH.
A gas company which contracted, for a valuable consideration, to furnish a city
with gas "free of charge," paid thereon the tax imposed by sect. 94 of the
Internal Revenue Act of June 30, 1864 (13 Stat. 264), as amended by the act
of July 18, 1866. 14 id. 128. Held, that the city is not liable to the company
for the amount so paid.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania.

This was a suit brought by the Pittsburgh Gas Company
against the city of Pittsburgh, to recover certain moneys paid
by the company to the United States.
That company was incorporated by an act of the legislature
of Pennsylvania, approved March 16, 1848, the city of Pittsburgh being the owner of six hundred and ninety-eight shares,
of the value of fifty dollars each, and having power to elect six
of the twelve trustees of said company. A supplement to said
act, approved Jan. 31, 1860, provided as follows, viz. "SECT. 7. That whenever the provisions of this act shall have
been accepted by the stockholders of said company and the councils of said city corporation, as hereinafter provided, the mayor,
aldermen, and citizens of Pittsburgh shall forthwith cease to be
stockholders in said company, and all the stock held by the city
corporation or standing in its name on the books of the said company shall be surrendered to the company, and the said city corporation shall have no further right to or interest in said stock;
but the same shall become a part of the the funds of the company,
and be distributed among the stockholders pro rata.
"SECT. 8. That the said company shall, at the cost of the city
corporation, construct, erect, and keep in order all such public
lamps and burners in the streets as the city councils may direct,
and shall also furnish all the gas required for consumption in the
public street-lamps, market-houses, council-chambers, and public
offices of the city, at the following rates, that is to say: Any quantity not exceeding twelve and one-half millions cubic feet of gas
annually, free of charge, and any excess over that quantity that
may be required annually at a rate not exceeding seventy-five
cents for each one thousand cubic feet of gas in such excess. The
price of such excess so furnished, together with the cost of con-

structing, erecting, and keeping in order the public lamps and
burners in the streets, shall be paid to the company quarterly by
the city corporation."
In pursuance of said act the councils of the City of Pittsburgh, on the third day of February, 1860, passed an ordinance
as follows: -

"That the provisions of an act of assembly approved the thirtyfirst day of January, A.D. one thousand eight hundred and sixty,
entitled ' A supplement to an act to incorporate the Pittsburgh Gas
Company,' approved the sixteenth day of March, A.D. one thousand
eight hundred and forty-eight, be and the same are hereby approved
and accepted by the councils of said city, and that a copy of this
ordinance, properly authenticated by the presidents and clerks of
councils, be delivered to the said gas company, and the mayor of
the city of Pittsburgh is hereby authorized and instructed to make
a proper surrender to the Pittsburgh Gas Company of all interest
and ownership of said city in any stock or other property and effects
in said gas company. That all ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent herewith be and the same are hereby repealed."
Pursuant to said act and ordinance, the mayor of said city
made and executed a surrender of its stock, which was accepted
upon the terms of said act by the company. The latter, during
the six months ending Jan. 1, 1870, furnished a large number
of feet of gas, including 6,250,000 feet to be furnished free,
under said act of assembly and agreement. By the ninetyfourth section of an act of Congress entitled "An Act to provide internal revenue to support the government, to pay interest
on the public debt, and for other purposes," approved June 30,
1864, and a supplement thereto, approved July 18, 1866, it
was provided as follows, viz.: "SECT. 3. Amendment to sect. 94. On gas, illuminating, made
of coal, wholly or in part, or any other material, when the product
shall not be above two hundred thousand cubic feet per month, a
tax of ten cents per one thousand cubic feet; when the product
shall be above two and not exceeding five hundred thousand cubic
feet per month, a tax of fifteen cents per one thousand cubic feet;
when the product shall be above five hundred thousand and not
exceeding five millions of cubic feet per month, a tax of twenty

cents per one thousand cubic feet; when the product shall be
above five millions, a tax of twenty-five cents per one thousand
cubic feet; and the general average of the monthly product for
the year preceding the return required by law shall determine the
rate of tax herein imposed. And where any gas-works have not
been in operation for the next year preceding the return as aforesaid, then the rate shall be determined by the estimated average
of the monthly product: Provided, that the product required to
be returned by law by any gas company shall be understood to be,
in addition to the gas consumed by said company or other party,
the product charged in the bills actually rendered by the gas
company during the month preceding the return; and until the
thirtieth day of April, digbteen hundred and sixty-seven, all gas
companies whose price is fixed by law are authorized to add the
tax herein imposed to the price per thousand feet on gas sold;
and all such companies which have heretofore contracted to furnish
gas to municipal corporations are, in like manner, and for the
same period, authorized to add such tax to such contract price:
Provided,further,that all gas furnished for lighting street-lamps, or
for other purposes, and not measured, and all gas made for and used
by any hotel, inn, tavern, and private dwelling-house, shall be subject to tax whatever the amount of product, and may be estimated,
and if the returns in any case shall be understated or underestimated,
it shall be the duty of the assistant assessor of the district to increase
the same as he shall deem just and proper: And provided, further,
that gas companies located within the corporate limits of any city
or town, whether in the same district or otherwise, or so located
as to compete with each other, shall pay the rate of tax imposed
by law upon the company having the largest production: And
provided,further, that coal-tar and ammoniacal liquor produced
in the manufacture of illuminating gas, and the products of redistillation of coal-tar, and the products of the manufacture of ammoniacal liquor thus produced, shall be exempt fi'om tax."
By a supplement to said act, passed March 2, 1867, sect. 94
of said act of July 18, 1866, was further amended as follows:
"1By striking out in the paragraph relating to gas the words,
' and until the thirtieth day of April, 1867.'" The city paid
the amount of bill for gas and the tax upon all gas furnished
up to Jan. 1, 1871, except the amount of tax on 6,250,000 feet
of gas which it claimed said gas company had contracted to

furnish"free of charge. The tax on said 6,250,000 feet, amounting to $1,562.50, was paid by the gas company to the United
States.
The foregoing facts were agreed upon by the parties and
submitted to the court in the nature of a special verdict.
Judgment was rendered for the defendant. It was affirmed
by the Supreme Court of the State, and the company thereupon
sued out this writ of error.
fr. Charles A. Bay for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. aeorge Shiras, Jr., contra.
MR. CH-EIF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
Sect. 94 of the Internal Revenue Act of 1864 (13 Stat. 264),
levying taxes on illuminating gas, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof, as amended in 1866 (14 id. 128), contained the
following provision :-

"All gas companies whose price is fixed by law are authorized
to add the tax herein imposed to the price per thousand feet on
gas sold; and all such companies which have heretofore. contracted
to furnish gas to municipal corporations are in like manner . . .
authorized to add such tax to such contract price. '"
This, we think, does not make a municipal corporation liable
for the tax in a case where a gas company has, for a valuable
consideration, contracted to furnish the corporation -with gas
'free
of charge."
Judgment affirmed.
