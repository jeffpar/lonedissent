TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ct.

We might pursue the subject further, and examine in detail.
the suggestions and authorities adduced by the learned court
which decided the case of Griswold v. Seligman and Pisher v.
Seligman; but it is unnecessary. What we have said is sufficient to indicate substantially the grounds on which we feel
obliged to dissent from its conclusions. In our judgment the
facts found by the court below make out a clear case of stock
held in trust and by way of collateral security only, and the
judgment rendered thereon was correct.
Judgment affirmed.

TURNER v. MARYLAND.
1.Section 41 of chapter 346 of the laws of Maryland of 1864, as amended and reenacted by chapter 291 of the laws of 1870, provides as follows: "After the
passage of this act, it shall not be lawful to carry out of this State, in hogsheads, any tobacco raised in this State, except in hogsheads which shall have
been inspected, passed, and marked agreeably to the provisions of this act,
unless such tobacco shall have been inspected and passed before this act goes
into operation; and any person violating the provisions of this section shall
forfeit and pay the sum of three hundred dollars, which may be recovered
in any court of law of this State, and which shall go to the credit of the tobacco fund: Provided,that nothing herein contained shall be construed to
prohibit any grower of tobacco, or any purchaser thereof, who may pack
the same in the county or neighborhood where grown, from exporting or
carrying out of this State any such tobacco without having the same opened
for inspection; but such tobacco so exported or carried out of this State
without inspection shall in all cases be marked with the name in full of the
owner thereof, and the place of residence of such owner, and shall be liable
to the same charge of outage and storage as in other cases, and any person
who shall carry or send out of this State any such tobacco, without having
it so marked, shall be subject to the penalty prescribed by this section."
Under that proviso, no requirement of the act of 1864 is dispensed with, except that of having the hogshead opened for inspection. The hogshead
must still be delivered at a State tobacco warehouse, and there numbered
and recorded and weighed and marked, and be found to be of the dimensions prescribed by statute, and to have been packed and marked as required. Held, 1. That said section 41, as so amended and re-enacted, is
not, in its provisions as to charges for outage and storage, in violation of
clause 2 of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States,
as respects any impost or duty imposed by it on exports, or of the clause of
section 8 of article 1 which gives power to the Congress "to regulate com.
merce with foreign nations and among the several States;" nor is it a regu-

lation of commerce or unconstitutional, as discriminating between the State
buyer and manufacturer of leaf tobacco and the purchaser who buys for
the purpose of transporting the tobacco to another State or to a foreign
country, or as discriminating between different classes of exporters of tobacco. 2. That the charge for outage, thereby made, is an inspection duty,
within the meaning of the Constitution, and it is not foreign to the character
of an inspection law to require every hogshead of tobacco to be brought
to a State tobacco warehouse. 3. That dispensing with an opening for
inspection of the hogsheads mentioned in the proviso does not, in view of
the other provisions of the tobacco inspection statutes of the State, deprive
those statutes of the character of inspection laws.

a charge or duty, under an inspection law, is or is not excessive.

The case is stated in the opinion of the court.
ERRO

Mr. John K. Cowen and Sir. Een J. D. Cross for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. Charles J. H. Gwinn, Attorney-General of Maryland,
contra.
MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.

The question presented for our consideration on this writ of
error is the constitutional validity of certain provisions in the
tobacco inspection statutes of the State of Maryland.
The plaintiff in error, Turner, was indicted in the Criminal
Court of Baltimore. The indictment contained two counts.
The first count alleged that Turner packed in a hogshead tobacco grown by him on a farm belonging to him in Charles
County, in Maryland, and marked the hogshead with his full
name and his place of residence in said county, and shipped it
to the city of Baltimore; that it was not delivered at any
tobacco warehouse in said city, under the management or control of any inspector of tobacco appointed for said warehouse
by the governor of the State of Maryland, under the Constitution and laws of said State, nor to any one of said inspectors of
tobacco, nor to any one acting under the authority of any one
of said inspectors of tobacco, to be weighed, passed, or marked,
and it was not weighed, passed, and marked by any such in-

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Of::

spector of tobacco, nor by any person acting under the authority of any one of said inspectors of tobacco; but that the said
Turner exported it from said city to Bremen, in Germany, without having procured it to be weighed, passed, and marked by
any such inspector of tobacco, or by any person acting under
the authority of any one of said inspectors of tobacco. The
second count contained the same allegations, and the further
averment that the said Turner did not, prior to said exportation, pay or cause to be paid any sum of money due for outage,
or any sum of money due for storage, to the State of Maryland,
on said hogshead, to any such inspector of tobacco, or to any
other person having authority to receive the same, although
certain sums of money were due and payable by him to said
State for outage and storage on said hogshead.
Separate demurrers were filed to each count of the indictment, and then a written stipulation was filed by the parties,
as follows: "It is agreed in this case, 1. That the matters
and facts charged in the indictment in this case are true, as
therein stated. 2. That for the more speedy final determination of the questions of law involved in this case the demurrers
which the traverser has entered to this indictment shall be
overruled proforma by the court. 3. That after such overruling of the demurrers the case shall be forthwith submitted to
the court, without the intervention of a jury, upon the admission contained in the first paragraph of this agreement." The
demurrers were then overruled. The court then rendered a
judgment that Turner pay a fine of $300. On the same day,
Turner, by petition to said criminal court, setting forth that he
bad been adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and by the judgment of said court ordered to pay the sum of $300 to said
State, prayed an appeal to the Court- of Appeals of Maryland,
assigning errors in the record. That court affirmed the judgment, and Turner has brought the case into this court by a writ
of error, alleging that the statutes of Maryland on which the
indictment was founded, and the validity of which was sustained by the State court, are repugnant to the Constitution of
the United States.
It is claimed by the defendant in error that the statutory
provisions the validity of which is denied by the plaintiff in

Oct. 1882.]

TuRNER V. MARYLAND.

error are "inspection laws," within the meaning of clause 2 of
section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States,
which clause is as follows: "No State shall, without the 6onsent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or
exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws; and the net proceeds of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the
use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws
shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress."
By chapter 346 of the laws of laryland of 1864, a new tobacco inspection law was enacted, as part of the code of public
local laws, in place of and expressly repealing certain portions
of said code. Sect. 1 provides for the appointment of five
tobacco inspectors, one for each State tobacco warehouse in
the city of Baltimore. By sect. 5 each tobacco inspector is
required to employ such clerks and laborers, and provide and
keep on band such books, implements, and materials, as may
be necessary for the economical and effective discharge of his
duties as such inspector, and the salaries of the various clerks
and laborers are prescribed, to be paid from the receipts in the
respective offices, with the requirement that the inspectors
shall at no time employ more labor than shall be necessary for
the effective performance of the work to be done. There are
provisions to facilitate the landing of tobacco at the wharves in
front of the warehouses, and its removal therefrom, and to
secure the safe preservation of the tobacco after its delivery
at the warehouse. Sect. 10 is as follows: "It shall be the
duty of each tobacco inspector to cause each hogshead of tobacco landed or delivered at the warehouse to which he is appointed to be numbered in succession as received, and to cause
said number to be entered in a book kept for that purpose, together with the time said hogshead was received, the name of
the vessel or other conveyance, if known to him, by which said
hogshead was brought to the city of Baltimore, and of the
owner or consignee of said tobacco, and the initials or other
marks on said hogshead, identifying the same; and, when said
hogshead shall be removed from said warehouse, he shall cause
an entry to be made, in some book kept for that purpose, of
the time when the same was so removed, the name of the per-

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ot.

son to whom the same was delivered, and of the vessel or other
,conveyance by which the same was taken away." It is provided by sect. 12 that each inspector shall cause all the tobacco
in the warehouse to which he may have been appointed to be
inspected as speedily as practicable, in regular order, as numbered; and by sect. 13 that he shall cause each hogshead of
tobacco, before it is uncased, to be weighed, and the tobacco in
each hogshead and the cask itself to be separately weighed,
and the weight of each hogshead, as first weighed, and the
gross and net weight of the tobacco therein contained, after
inspection, to be entered in a proper book, with sufficient reference to its marks and numbers as previously recorded; and
by sect. 14 that be shall mark on the side of each hogshead,
with a marking-iron, its warehouse number and weight, and
the net weight of tobacco contained therein, and its warehouse
number on each head, with blacking; and, by succeeding sections, that he shall unease and break all tobacco, in whatever
State raised, and draw samples from each hogshead, and tie
each lot of samples together, and label it with the warehouse
number of the hogshead, and the number of the warehouse,
and the date of inspection, and the name of its owner, or, if
known, the initials or other marks on the hogshead, and deliver
it sealed, if the tobacco be merchantable, to the owner, with a
certificate stating the date of inspection, the warehouse mark
and number of the hogshead, the weight thereof, and the net
weight of the tobacco in it, and that unmerchantable tobacco
shall be reconditioned, packed, reweighed, and reinspected, and
then sampled and certified; and by sect. 27 that every hogshead shall be liable to the charge of $1.50 outage, if weighing
less than 1,100 pounds, and to 15 cents additional for every
100 pounds, which shall be paid by the purchaser thereof to the
inspector, before it is removed. Penalties are imposed by sect.
40 for erasing, altering, or adding to any mark placed by the
inspector on any hogshead or any label of any sample, and for
fraudulently taking any tobacco from a sample, or substituting
other tobacco for any in such sample, and for counterfeiting
any inspector's certificate or seal. Sect. 41 is as follows:
"After the pasgage of this act, it shall not be lawful to carry out
of this State, in hogsheads, any tobacco raised in this State,

Oct. 1882.]

TUaNER v. MARYLAND.

except in hogsheads which shall have been inspected, passed,
and marked agreeably to the provisions of this act, unless such
tobacco shall have been inspected and passed before this act
goes into operation; and any person violating the provisions of
this section shall forfeit and pay the sum of three hundred dollars, which may be recovered in any court of law of this State,
and which shall go to the credit of the tobacco fund." This
section was amended by chapter 291 of the laws of 1870, by reenacting it with the following addition: "Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit any grower
of tobacco, or any purchaser thereof, who may pack the same
in the county or neighborhood where grown, from exporting or
carrying out of this State any such tobacco without having the
same opened for inspection; but such tobacco so exported or
carried out of this State without inspection shall in all cases be
marked with the name in full of the owner thereof, and the
place of residence of such owner, and shall be liable to the
same charge of outage and storage as in other case§, and any
person who shall carry or send out of this State any such tobacco, without having it so marked, shall be subject to the penalty prescribed by this section." Sect. 42 prescribes the size
of the casks in which tobacco raised in Maryland shall be
packed, and forbids the inspector to inspect or pass it until
packed in a hogshead of proper dimensions.
By chapter 36 of the laws of 1872, entitled "An Act to add
a new article to the code of public general laws regulating the
inspection of tobacco," some additional regulations were made,
and some existing provisions were re-enacted, and some changes
were made, and all inconsistent provisions of law were repealed;
but the only material additions or changes made, so far as the
present case is concerned, were these: By sect. 11, every inspector shall have uncased and break every hogshead of tobacco delivered for inspection, in so many places for Maryland
and Ohio, and in so many places for Kentucky and Virginia,
and, if the tobacco is sound, take a sample, and mark the hogshead with its number, the year of inspection, and the initials
of the owner on each head and on the bilge, and the tare and
net weight on the bilge. By sect. 15, each inspector shall keep
in a book "the name of the owner, the number, gross, tare, and

44

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ct.

net weight of every. hogshead of tobacco inspected by him, the
State where grown, the consignee of the same, the name of the
vessel by which shipped out, and the name of the party shipping the same, and for every hogshead so inspected by him he
shall issue his certificate or note, stating in such certificate or
note the name or initials of the owner, the number of the hogshead, the State where grown, the date of inspection, and the
gross, tare, and net weight of the hogshead, and he shall make
no delivery of inspected tobacco from his warehouse except
upon surrender of the certificate or note corresponding with
the number of the hogshead." By sect. 26, "no tobacco of
the growth of this State shall be passed or accounted lawful
tobacco unless the same be packed. in hogsheads not exceeding
fifty-four inches in length of the staves, nor exceeding forty-six
inches across the head, and the owner, or his agent, of tobacco
packed in any hogshead of greater dimensions shall repack, the
same in hogsheads of the size herein prescribed, at his own
expense, before the same shall be passed."
By chapter 228 of the laws of 1872, the charge for outage
is fixed at 82 for every hogshead not exceeding 1,100 pounds,
and 12J cents additional on every 100 pounds over 1,100 pounds,
to be paid by the shipper of the tobacco, or his agent.
In order to determine whether the statutory provisions in
question are obnoxious to the objection made, their meaning
must be ascertained. The act of 1864 requires the inspector
to examine the hogshead to ascertain whether it is of the required dimensions, and then to inspect the tobacco itself by
sampling the contents, and, when this has been done, and the
weight ascertained, the hogshead is passed. In regard to
the addition made by the act of 1870, c. 291, to sect. 41 of
the act of 1864, the grower or purchaser of tobacco packed
in the county or neighborhood where it is grown is permitted
to export the same without having the hogshead opened for
inspection by sampling its contents; but the act requires such
hogshead to be marked with the name and residence of the
owner, and it is made liable to the charge of outage as in other
cases, and any one violating its provisions is subjected to the
penalty imposed by sect. 41 of the act of 1864. The act of
1870, in thus permitting the grower or purchaser of tobacco

Oct. 1882.]

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

packed in the county or neighborhood where it is grown to
export the same without having the hogshead opened for inspection, does not dispense with any other requirement of the
act of 1864 in regard to inspection. It provides, in express
terms, that each hogshead thus packed shall be marked with
the name and residence of the owner. It is necessary, therefore, that some one shall ascertain whether these requirements
have been complied with, and whether the tobacco was, in fact,
the growth of the county or neighborhood where it was packed.
It also requires that such tobacco shall be liable to the same
charge of outage as in other cases, and, as the charge of outage
depends upon the weight of the hogshead, it is necessary that
some one shall ascertain the weight of such hogshead, in order
to determine the amount to be paid. It does not change or in
any manner dispense with the statutory requirements in regard
to the dimensions of the hogshe.ad in which such tobacco is to
be packed, and it is necessary that some one shall see that
these requirements are complied with. These and other duties,
it is obvious, are to be performed by the inspectors, and when
they are performed the hogshead is to be passed and marked
as provided by the act of 1864. When the words "such tobacco so exported or carried out of this State without inspection" are read in connection with the preceding sentence,
which permits the grower or purchaser to export such tobacco
"without having the same opened for inspection," it is clear
that the term "without inspection" refers to inspection by
opening the hogshead and sampling the contents.
The act of 1872, c. 36, changes some of the provisions of the
act of 1864, omits others, and in express terms repeals all acts
or parts of acts inconsistent with its provisions. The penal
clause of the act of 1864, as amended by the act of 1870, which
makes it unlawful to carry out of the State in hogsheads tobacco raised in the State, except in hogsheads inspected, passed,
and marked according to the provisions of the act, is omitted in
the act of 1872; but there is nothing, either in the title or the
general framework of the act, or in the manner in which
the subject-matter is dealt with, to justify the conclusion that
the legislature intended the act of 1872 as a substitute for all
prior legislation on the subject. The provisions of such prior

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. C .

laws are essential to give completeness to the system of which
the act of 1872 is but a part. That does not, it is true, make
it unlawful to export tobacco raised in the State unless the
same shall have been inspected and passed, but it does provide that no tobacco, the growth of the State, shall be passed
or accounted lawful tobacco unless the same be packed in hogsheads of certain prescribed dimensions. It does not say, in so
many words, that the tobacco raised in the State and intended
for exportation shall be delivered at one of the State tobacco
warehouses, but it does provide for the appointment of inspectors of tobacco, clerks and other officials, with fixed salaries, and assigns them to the tobacco warehouses, with no duty
to perform unless it be the inspection of tobacco. In thus
declaring that no tobacco, the growth of the State, shall be
accounted lawful tobacco unless packed in the manner prescribed by the act, it is plain .the legislature meant it to be
the duty of the inspectors appointed by the act to ascertain
whether such tobacco was thus packed in conformity with the
requirements of the statute, and this they could not do unless
such tobacco should be delivered at the State tobacco warehouses. The legislature meant, and only meant, to select certain provisions from the public local law in relation to the
inspection of tobacco, and to re-enact these in a public general
law, and to leave such portion of the local law which it did
not thus re-enact and did not modify or repeal by inconsistent
provisions, as existing parts of the local law. The act of 1872
did not modify or repeal sect. 41 of the act of 1864, as modified
by the act of 1870, which constituted part of the local law;
and under that section it was the duty of the plaintiff in error
to have delivered the tobacco packed by him at one of the
State tobacco warehouses, in order that the inspectors might
ascertain whether it was packed in hogsheads of the proper
dimensions, and whether it was packed in the county or neighborhood where it was grown, and marked as the statute directed. The legislature did not intend that merely marking
the name of the grower or purchaser on the hogshead should
release such grower or purchaser from the other requirements
of the act. These views are those which were held by the
Court of Appeals of Maryland in its opinion delivered in this

Oct. 1882.]
case.

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

55 Md. 240. The result is, that all that the act of
1870 does in regard to a grower or purchaser of tobacco raised
in Maryland, who packs the same in hogsheads in the county
or neighborhood where such tobacco is grown, and who exports
it or carries it out of the State, is to dispense with the opening
of such hogsheads for inspection, but that it does not dispense
with any other requirement of the act of 1864 in regard to
inspection; and that it is a part of such inspection for the inspector to see that the hogshead is marked with the name and
place of residence of the owner, and to verify the claimed fact
that the tobacco was raised in Maryland and packed in the
county or neighborhood where it was grown, and to weigh the
hogshead in order to determine the charge for outage, and to
see that the hogshead conforms in dimensions to the requirement of the statute, so that the tobacco may be passed and accounted lawful tobacco. It is also apparent, that not until the
above and other duties have been performed by the inspectors can the hogshead be passed and marked as required by
the act of 1864. This requires, in regard to the hogsheads
specially mentioned in the proviso enacted in 1870 to sect. 41
of the act of 1864, that they be delivered at one of the State
tobacco warehouses, and that the provisions of sect. 10 of the
act of 1864 be observed, that is, that the inspector shall number each hogshead in succession, and enter the number in a
book, with the time the hogshead is received, and the name,
if known, of the conveyance by which it was brought to Baltimore, and the name of the owner or consignee of the tobacco,
and the initials or other marks on the hogshead identifying it,
and, on its removal, enter in a book the time of removal, and
the name of the person to whom it is delivered, and of the conveyance by which it is taken away; that, under sect. 12 of the
act of 1864, it shall be inspected in all required particulars except opening it; that, under sect. 13 of that act, the inspector
shall weigh the hogshead unopened and enter such weight in
a book, with sufficient reference to its marks and numbers as
previously recorded; that, under sect. 14 of that act, the inspector shall mark with a marking-iron, on the side of each
hogshead, its warehouse number and weight, and on each head
its warehouse number; and that not until these things have

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. 0[.

been done is the tobacco to be passed or accounted as lawful
tobacco.
The plaintiff in error contends that sect. 41 of the act of
1864, as re-enacted by the act of 1870, violates the Constitution of the United States, because: 1. It is a regulation of
inter-state and foreign commerce, and a law levying a duty on
exports, and does not fall within the class of laws known as
inspection laws, because the proviso enacts that the tobacco to
which it refers need not be opened for inspection. 2. Said
section, even though it is an inspection statute, discriminates
against the non-resident buyer and manufacturer of leaf tobacco, and in favor of the State buyer and manufacturer, in
imposing burdensome regulations on tobacco intended for export, and laying a tax of at least two dollars a hogshead on
such tobacco when exported, while tobacco manufactured within the State is free from such regulations and such tax, and
thus it discriminates against inter-state and foreign commerce
in tobacco, and in favor of local manufacturers and the internal
trade of the State. 3. Said section discriminates between different classes of exporters of tobacco, in that it permits tobacco
exported by persons who pack it in the county or neighborhood where it is grown, to be exported when marked with the
full name and residence of the owner, without inspection other
than the examination of the outsides of the hogsheads, while
exporters of another class must have the contents of their
hogsheads subjected to examination.
The provisions of the Constitution of the United States alleged to be violated are clause 2 of section 10 of article 1,
before quoted, and that clause of section 8 of article 1 which
provides that the Congress shall have power "to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States."
The Mlaryland court held that the charge of outage in this
case was an inspection duty, within the meaning of the Constitution ; that the State had the power to prescribe the dimensions of the hogshead in which tobacco raised in Maryland
shall be packed, and to require such hogshead to be delivered
at one of the State tobacco warehouses, in order that the inspectors may ascertain whether it conforms to the requirements
of the law, and whether it is the true growth of the State and

Oct. 1882.]

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

packed by the grower or purchaser in the county or neighborhood where it was grown; and that the charge of outage, to
reimburse the State for the expenses thereby incurred, and in
consideration of the storage of the hogshead, is in the nature of
an inspection duty, within the meaning of the Constitution.
The contention of the plaintiff in error is, that a law which
otherwise would be an inspection law ceases to be such if no
provision is made for opening the package containing the article and examining the quality of its contents. On this subject
the Maryland court held, that, in order to constitute an inspection law, an examination of the quality of the article itself is
not necessary; but that to prepare the products of a State for
exportation it may be necessary that such products should be
put in packages of a certain form, and of certain prescribed
dimensions, either on account of the nature and character of
such products, or to enable the State to identify the products
of its own growth, and to furnish the evidence of such identification in the markets to which they are exported. In opposition to these views, which appear to us to be sound, we are
asked to hold that the provisions under consideration do not
fall under the head of inspection laws, in a case where the
question is presented without the finding of any facts to show
that what may be thus necessary in regard to a product is not
necessary in regard to tobacco, and with every presumption to
the contrary arising out of the course of legislation as to the
inspection of tobacco, by the State of Maryland. The legislature of the State of Maryland, from the earliest history of the
colony and since the formation of the State government, has
made the inspection of tobacco raised in that State compulsory. That inspection has included many features, and has
extended to the form, size, and weight of the packages containing the tobacco, as well as to the quality of the article. Fixing
the identity and weight of tobacco alleged to have been grown
in the State, and thus preserving the reputation of the article
in markets outside of the State, is a legitimate part of inspection laws, and the means prescribed therefor in the statutes in
question naturally conduce to that end. Such provisions, as
parts of inspection laws, are as proper as provisions for inspecting quality; and it cannot be said that the absence of the latter
VOL.

XVII.

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ct.

provisions, in respect to any particular class of tobacco, necessarily causes the laws containing the former provisions to cease
to be inspection laws. It is easy to see that the use of the
precaution of weighing and marking the weight on the hogshead and recording it in a book is to enable it to be determined
at any time whether the contents have been diminished subsequently to the original packing, by comparing a new weight
with the original marked weight, or, if the marked weight be
altered, with the weight entered in the warehouse book. The
things required to be done in respect to the hogshead of tobacco in the present case, aside from any inspection of quality,
are to be done to prepare and fit the hogshead, as a unit, containing the tobacco, for exportation, and for becoming an
article of foreign commerce or commerce among the States,
and are to be done before it becomes such an article. They
are properly parts of inspection laws, within the definition
given by this court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1. In a
note to the argument of Mr. Emmet in that case, at page 119,
are collected references to many statutes of the States, in the
form of inspection laws, showing what features have been generally recognized as falling within the domain of those laws, such as the size of barrels or casks, and the number of hoops
on them; what pieces of beef or pork, and what quantity and
size of nails, should be in one cask; the length, breadth, and
thickness of staves and heading, lumber, boards, shingles, &c.;
and the branding of pot and pearl ashes, flour, fish, and lumber, and the forfeiture of them, if unbranded. These were
cited as instances of the exercise by States of the power to act
upon an article grown or produced in a State, before it became
an article of foreign or domestic commerce, or of commerce
among the States, to prepare it for such purpose. It was in
reference to laws of this character that it was said, in argument, in Gibbons v. Ogden, that the enactments seemed arbitrary, and were not founded on the idea that the things the
exportation of which was thus prohibited or restrained were
dangerous or noxious, but had for their object to improve foreign trade and raise the character and reputation of the articles
in a foreign market. It was in reference to such laws, among
other inspection laws, that Chief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons

Oct. 1882.]

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

v. Ogden, p. 203, after remarking that a power to regulate
commerce was not the source from which a right io pass inspection laws was derived, said: " The object of inspection
laws is to improve the quality of articles produced by the
labor of a country; to fit them for exportation; or, it may be,
for domestic use. They act upon the subject before it becomes
an article of foreign commerce, or of commerce among the
States, and prepare it for that purpose. They form a portion
of that immense mass of legislation which embraces everything
within the territory of a State, not surrendered to the general
government: all which can be most advantageously exercised
by the States themselves." It was not suggested by the court
that those particular laws were not valid exercises of the
power of the State to fit the articles for exportation, or that in
addition to, or even aside from, ascertaining the quality of the
article produced in a State, the State could not define the form
of the lawful package or its weight, and subject form and
weight, with or without quality, to the supervision of an inspector, to ascertain that the required conditions in respect to
the article were observed.
In addition to the instances cited in Gibbons v. Ogden, the
diligence of the attorney-general of the State of Maryland has
collected and presented to us, in argument, numerous instances,'

showing, by the text of the inspection laws of the thirteen
American colonies and States, in force in 1787, when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, that the form,
capacity, dimensions, and weight of packages were objects of
inspection irrespective of the quality of the contents of the
packages. The instances embrace, among others, the dimensions of shingles, staves, and hoops; the size of casks and
barrels for fish, pork, beef, pitch, tar, and turpentine; and the
size of hogsheads of tobacco. In Maryland, the dimensions of
tobacco hogsheads were fixed by various statutes passed from
the year 1658 to the year 1763. By the act of 1763, c. 18,
sect. 18, it was enacted that all tobacco packed in hogsheads exceeding forty-eight inches in the length of the stave,
and seventy inches in the whole diameters within the staves,
at the croze and bulge, should be accounted unlawful tobacco
and should not be passed or received. Like provisions fixing
the dimensions of hogsheads of tobacco have been in force in
Maryland from 1789 till now. In view of such legislation existing at the time the Constitution of the United States was

called "inspection laws" in those States, it follows that the
Constitution, in speaking of "inspection laws," included such
laws, and intended to reserve to the States the power of continuing to pass such laws, even though to carry them out, and
make them effective, in preventing the exportation from the
State of the various commodities, unless the provisions of the
laws were observed, it became necessary to impose charges
which amounted to duties or imposts -on exports to an extent
absolutely necessary to execute such laws. The general sense
in which the power of the States in this respect has been understood since the adoption of the Constitution is shown by the

form, capacity, dimensions, and weight of packages containing
articles grown or produced in a State, and intended for exportation. These laws are none the less inspection laws because,
as was said by this court in Gibbons v. Ogden, they "may have
a remote and considerable influence on commerce." It is a
circumstance of weight that the laws referred to in the Constitution are by it made "subject to the revision and control of
the Congress." Congress may, therefore, interpose, if at any
time any statute, under the guise of an inspection law, goes
beyond the limit prescribed by the Constitution, in imposing
duties or imposts on imports or exports. These and kindred
laws of Maryland have been in force for a long term of years,
and there has been no such interposition.
Objection is made that the Maryland laws are not inspection

The legislation of Maryland, since 1787, affords the following instances: Pot
and pearl ashes, intended for exportation from Baltimore, or Georgetown, in
Montgomery County, were required to be packed in a particular manner in
casks, and to be inspected and weighed. 1792, c. 65. A similar provision was
made to prevent the exportation of unmerchantable flour and unsound salted
provisions from Havre de Grace, by the act of 1796, c. 21; and from Chester,
by the act of 1797, c. 7. By the act of 1781, c. 12, provision was made to prevent the exportation of bread and flour which were not merchantable, from the
town of Havre de Grace. This act was enacted for a limited time only, and
expired. It was revived and enacted into a permanent law by the act of 1801,
c. 102, sect. 2, and is set forth in a note to the section last referred to, in the acts
of 1801. By sect. 6 of the act of 1801, c. 102, the size of all flour casks brought
to Baltimore Town for exportation, the character of the materials and make, the
manner of hooping and nailing such hoops, the particular length of the staves,
the diameter of the casks at the heads, and the number of pounds of flour to be
in each cask, are specifically prescribed. The size of laths, and the mode of
packing them, was regulated by the act of 1811, c. 69. The number and character of hoops upon casks of ground black-oak bark, exported from the port of
Baltimore, was prescribed by the act of 1821, c. 77. The gross weight of a hogshead of tobacco, as well as its net weight, was required to be marked on the
hogshead by the act of 1789, c. 26, sect. 21. The dimensions of the hogsheads
in which tobacco was required to be packed was prescribed by sect. 35 of the act
last cited. Further illustration may be found in the following legislation:

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

laws, but are regulations of commerce, because they require
every hogshead of tobacco to be brought to a State tobacco
warehouse. But we are of opinion that, it being lawful to require the article to be subjected to the prescribed examination
by a public officer before it can be accounted a lawful subject
of commerce, it is not foreign to the character of an inspection
law to require that the article shall be brought to the officer
instead of sending the officer to the article. It is a matter as
to which the State has a reasonable discretion, and we are
unable to see that such discretion has been exercised in any
such manner as to carry the statutes beyond the scope of inspection laws.
There is another view of the subject which has great force.
Recognized elements of inspection laws have always been quality of the article, form, capacity, dimensions, and weight of
package, mode of putting up, and marking and branding of
various kinds, all these matters being supervised by a public
officer having authority to pass or not pass the article as lawful
merchandise, as it did or did not answer the prescribed requirements. It has never been regarded as necessary, and it is
manifestly not necessary, that all of these elements should
coexist in order to make a valid inspection law. Quality
alone may be the subject of inspection, without other requirement, or the inspection may be made to extend to all of the
above matters. When all are prescribed, and then inspection
as to quality is dropped out, leaving the rest in force, it cannot
be said to be a necessary legal conclusion that the law has ceased
to be an inspection law.
As is suggested in Neilson v. Garza, 2 Woods, 287, by Mr.
Justice Bradley, it may be doubtful whether it is not exclusively the province of Congress, and not at all that of a court, to
decide whether a charge or duty, under an inspection law, is or
is not excessive. There is nothing in the record from which it
can be inferred that the State of Maryland intended to make
its tobacco-inspection laws a mere cover for laying revenue
duties upon exports. The case is not like that of Jackson Mining Co. v. Auditor-General,32 Mich. 488, where a State tax
imposed on mineral ore exported from the State before being
smelted was held to be a tax on inter-state commerce, no such

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ot.

tax being imposed on like ore reduced within the. State. The
question of the right of Maryland, under the Constitution of
the United States, to require that the dimensions and gross
weight of a hogshead containing tobacco grown upon its soil
shall be ascertained by its officers before the tobacco shall be
exported, is a question of law, because the question is as to
whether such law is an inspection law. Moreover, the question
as to whether the charges for such examination and its attendant duties are "absolutely necessary," was not before the State
court, and was not passed upon by it, and cannot be considered
by this court.
It is urged, however, that the Maryland law is a regulation
of commerce and unconstitutional, because it discriminates between the State buyer and manufacturer of leaf tobacco and
the purchaser who buys for the purpose of transporting the
tobacco to another State or to a foreign country. But the
State, having the right to prescribe the form, dimensions, and
capacity of the packages in which its products shall be encased
before they are brought to, or sold in, the public market, has
enacted that no tobacco of the growth of the State shall be
passed or accounted lawful tobacco unless it be packed in hogsheads of a specified size. Laws of 1872, c. 36, sect. 26. This
regulation covers all tobacco grown in the State and packed
in hogsheads, without reference to the purpose for which it is
packed. If the tobacco is to be dealt in within the limits of
the State, the examination as to dimensions is properly left to
the contracting parties, probably under the view that the seller
for the home market will have a sufficient stimulus to observe
the requirement of the law, in a desire to maintain the reputation of his commodity. But, if the tobacco is to be exported
as lawful tobacco, the State may, with equal propriety, prescribe and enforce an examination by an officer, within the
State, of a hogshead containing tobacco grown in the State,
and intended for shipment beyond the limits of the State, in
order to ascertain, before the hogshead is carried out of the
State, and before it becomes an article of commerce, that it is
of the dimensions prescribed as necessary to make it lawful
tobacco. In Cooley v. Th7e Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, a
law of Pennsylvania provided that a vessel not taking a pilot

Oct. 1882.]

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

should pay half pilotage, but that this should not apply to
American vessels engaged in the Pennsylvania coal trade. It
was held that the general regulation as to half pilotage was
proper, and that the exemption was a fair exercise of legislative
discretion acting upon the subject of the regulation of the
pilotage of the port of Philadelphia. The court said that, in
making pilotage regulations, the legislative discretion had been
constantly exercised, in this and other countries, in making discriminations, founded on differences both in the character of
the trade and in the tonnage of vessels engaged therein. Any
discrimination appearing in the present case is of the same
character as that in the pilotage case, and fairly within the
discretion of the State. Such discretion reasonably extends
to exempting from opening for internal inspection an article
grown in the State, when it is marked with the name of an
ascertained owner, and to requiring that an article grown in
the State shall be opened for internal inspection when it is not
intended to be put on the market on the credit of an ascertained
owner, and is not identified by marks as owned by him. So,
too, in the exercise of the same discretion, and of its power to
prescribe the method in which its products shall be fitted for
exportation, it may direct that a certain product, while it remains "in the bosom of the country" and before it has become
an article "of foreign commerce or of commerce between the
States," shall be encased in such a package as appears best
fitted to secure the safety of the package and to identify its
contents as the growth of the State, and may direct that the
weight of the package, and the name of the owner of its contents, shall be plainly marked on the package, and may also
exempt the contents from inspection as to quality, when the
weight of the package and the name of the owner are duly ascertained to be marked thereon. Such a law is an inspection
law, and may be executed by imposing a "tax or duty of
inspection," which tax, so far as it acts upon articles for exportation, is an exception to the prohibition on the States against
laying duties on exports, the exception being made because the
tax would otherwise be within the prohibition. Brown v.
State of Afaryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 438. At the same time we
fully recognize the principle, that any inspection law is subject

TURNER V. MARYLAND.

[Sup. Ct.

to the paramount right of Congress to regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States.
The general provision of the Maryland statute is, that it
shall not be lawful to carry out of the State, in hogsheads, any
tobacco raised in the State, except in hogsheads which shall have
been inspected, passed, and marked agreeably to the provisions
of the act. These provisions include the doing of many things
in addition to an inspection of quality. If the tobacco is grown
in the State, and packed in the county or neighborhood where
grown, it may be carried out of the State without having its
quality inspected, if it be marked in the manner prescribed.
But it still is necessary it should be inspected in all other particulars, and inspected also to ascertain that it was grown in
the State and packed where grown, and is marked as required.
If it does not answer the latter requirements it is to be further
inspected as to quality. The necessity thus existing for subjecting the hogshead to inspection under all circumstances, a
charge of some kind was proper for outage, that is, a charge
payable, on withdrawing the hogshead, for labor connected
with receiving and handling it and doing the other things above
mentioned. Such charge appears to be a charge for services
properly rendered.
The above views cover the objection made that the Maryland
law discriminates between different classes of exporters of tobacco, and favors the person who packs it for exportation in
the county or neighborhood where it is grown, as against other
exporters. Whatever discrimination in this respect or in respect of purchases for exportation, before referred to, results
from any provisions of the law, is a discrimination which, we
think, the State has a right to make, resulting, as it does,
wholly from regulations which affect the article before it has
become an article of commerce, and which attach to it as and
when it is grown, and before it is packed or sold. The tobacco
is grown with these regulations in force, and the State has a
right to say what shall be lawful merchantable tobacco. This
is really all that has been done in regard to the tobacco in
question.
In this case no inspection is involved except that of tobacco
grown in Maryland, and we must not be understood as express-

which refer to the inspection of tobacco grown out of Maryland.
Judgment affirmed.

PEOPLE v. COMPAGNIE G] NARALE TRANSATLANTIQUE.
1. The statute of New York of May 31, 1881, imposing a tax on every alien
passenger who shall come by vessel from a foreign country to the port
of New York, and holding the vessel liable for the tax, is a regulation of
foreign commerce, and void. Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S.
259, and Chy Lung v. Freeman, id. 275, cited, and the rulings therein made
reaffirmed.
2. The statute is not relieved from this constitutional objection by declaring in
its title that it is to raise money for the execution of the inspection laws
of the State, which authorize passengers to be inspected in order to determine who are criminals, paupers, lunatics, orphans, or infirm persons, without means or capacity to support themselves and subject to become a public
charge, as such facts are not to be ascertained by inspection alone.
3. The words "inspection laws," "imports," and "exports," as used in cl. 2, sect.
10, art. 1, of tie Constitution, have exclusive reference to property.
4. This is apparent from the language of ci. 1, sect. 9, of the same article, where,
in regard to the admission of persons of the African race, the word "migration" is applied to free persons, and "importation" to slaves.
