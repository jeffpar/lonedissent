v. EHimAN.

ROTH v. E

AN.

This court has no jurisdiction to re-examine the judgment of a State court recognizing as valid the decree of a foreign court annulling a marriage.

MOTION to dismiss a writ of error to the Supreme Court of
the State of Illinois.
The case is sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court.

-4fr. Juliu8 Rosenthal and Xir. A. H. Pence in support of the
motion.
Mr. 0. Al fTarris in opposition thereto.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
The only question in this case controverted below was
whether Madelaine Roth, the plaintiff in error, was the widow
of John George Roth, deceased, and that depended entirely on
the validity of the decree of the Royal Matrimonial Court of
Elwangen, in the Kingdom of Wurtemburg, annulling the marriage of the parties. The Supreme Court of Illinois decided
in favor of the validity of the Wurtemburg decree, and consequently that she was not his widow and not entitled to dower
in his estate, or to inheritance under the laws of Illinois. This
presents no question of which we can take cognizance under
sect. 709 of the Revised Statutes. No right, title, privilege,
or immunity which could be claimed under the authority of
the United States was involved, and the validity of no treaty
or statute of, or any authority exercised under, the United
States was drawn in question. Neither was there any statute
or authority of the State relied on which was in conflict with
the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States.
Xiotion granted.
