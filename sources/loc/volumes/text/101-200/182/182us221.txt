DOOLEY v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 501. ArguedJanuary 8,9,10,11,1901.-DecidedMay 27,1901.

The Court of Claims, and the Circuit Courts, acting as such, have jurisdiction of actions for the recovery of duties illegally exacted upon merchandise, alleged not to have been imported from a foreign country.
Duties upon imports from the United States to Porto Rico, collected by
the military commander and by the President as Commander-in-Chief,
from the time possession was taken of the island until the ratification of
the treaty of peace, were legally exacted under the war power.
As the right to exact duties upon-importations from Porto Rico to New
York ceased with the ratification of the treaty of peace, the correlitive
right to exact duties upon imports from New York to Porto Rico also
ceased at the same time.

THIs was an action begun in the Circuit Court, aÂ§ a Court of
"Claims, by the firm of Dooley, Smith & Co., engaged in trade
and commerce between Porto Rico and New York, to recover
back certain duties to the amount of $5314.68, exacted and
paid under protest at theport of San Juan, Porto Rico, upon
several consignments of merchandise imported into Porto Rico
from New York between July 26, 1898, and May 1, 1900, viz.:
1. From July 26, 1898, until August 19,1898, under the terms
of the proclamation of General Miles, directing the exaction of
the former Spanish and Porto Rican duties.
2. From August 19, 1898, until February 1, 1899, under the
customs tariff for Porto Rico, proclaimed by order of the
President.
