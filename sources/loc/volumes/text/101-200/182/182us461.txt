UNITED STATES ex rel. QUEEN v. ALVEY.
Syllabus.

case has arisen since September 29, 1894, in which the transcript
has not been filed within forty days from the time of the appeal
entered and perfected in the court below, except where the time
has been extended in accordance with the rule, by an order
made by a judge of the court below before the expiration of
the time limited by the rule or by a previous order. In the
case of the District of Columbia v. Humphprey, 11 App. D. C.
68, the appeal was dismissed solely because the transcript was
not filed in the Court of Appeals within the forty days prescribed by the rule in question, and without reference to whether
the appeal operated as a supersedeas. The opinion of the Court
of Appeals in that case was published among the regular reports
of that court in 18982
Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that the
rule must receive the interpretation which was given it by the
Court of Appeals.

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH
CIRCUIT.
NO. 245. Argued Apr11 17,18,1901.-Decided May 27, 1901.
As the governing committee of the stock exchange had no personal interest
in the fund in question in this suit, which was placed in its possession
in the trust and confidence that it would see that the purposes of the deposit were fulfilled, and that the *moneyswere paid out only in accordance with the terms of the trust under which it was deposited, there can
be no question that the fund became thereby a trust fund in the possession of the governing committee, and the disposition of which, in accordance with the trust, they were called upon to secure. The committee
occupied, from the time of the deposit of the funds, a fiduciary relation
towards the parties depositing it, and became a trustee of the fund,
charged with the duty of seeing that it was applied in conformity with
the provisions creating it.
The jurisdiction of the court below was plainly established, because, under
the circumstances, the complainant had no adequate and full remedy at
law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.
It plainly appears in this case from the pleadings that the sales and purchases of stock were in fact made subject to the rules of the stock exchange, and all the transactions regarding the sales and purchases must
be regarded as haying taken place with direct reference and subject to
those rules.
A principal can adopt and ratify an unauthorized act of his agent, who in
fact is assuming to act in his behalf, although not disclosing his agency
to others, and when it is so ratified, it is as if the principal had given an
original authority to that effect, and the ratification relates back to the
time of the act which is ratified.
A contract which is, on its face one of sale, with a provision for future delivery is valid, and the burden of proving that it is invalid, as being a
cover for the settlement of differences, rests with the party making the
assertion.
There is nothing in these contracts which shows that they were gaming
contracts, and in violation of the statutes of Illinois; and there is no
evidence that they were entered into pursuant to any understanding
whatever that they shquld be fulfilled by payments of the difference between the contract and the market price at the time set for delivery.
The sales were made subject to the i'ules of the exchange, but those rules
do not assume to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts, or to provide an
exclusive remedy which the parties must follow.
The complainants were justified in the course which they pursued, and'. the
price at which the stock sold was a fair basis upon which to determine
the amount of damages.

TME petitioners and complainants, being residents of the State
and city of New York, commenced this suit in equity in the
United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against certain of the defendants composing the governing
committee of the Chicago Stock Exchange, to recover funds
deposited with them, in trust, and also to recover damages
against other defendants composing the firm of Jamieson &
Company, brokers belonging to the exchange, alleged to have
been sustained by the complainants by a violation by those defendants of their contract to purchase and pay for certain stock
sold them by the complainants. Still other defendants composed the firm of Schwartz & Company, the brokers who effected
the sales of the stock for the complainants, no recovery being
sought against them. All of the defendants were residents of
the State of Illinois. The Circuit Court after a hearing gave
judgment for a dismissal of the bill for want of any privity of
contract between complainants and defendants, Jamieson &

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Statement of the Case.

Company, against whom a money recovery was sought. On
appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
affirmed the judgment of dismissal, and in the opinion discussed
only the question whether or not the contract sued on was a
gaming one and in violation of the statute of Illinois on that
subject, sections 130 and 131 of the Criminal Code hereinafter
set forth. It held that the contract violated those sections and
that the bill was properly dismissed for want of equity, and it
therefore affirmed the decree of dismissal. The complainants
thereupon petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari, which
was granted, and the case brought here.
No important question arises upon the pleadings, with the
exception that it was set up by way of defence that the complainants had an adequate remedy at law, and the facts upon
which the defence is rested are sufficiently adverted to in the
opinion. The pleadings admit that the sales and purchases of
stock were all made subject to the rules of the exchange. The
case was referred to a master .to take testimony and to report
the same to the court with his conclusions thereon, and it was
subsequently brought to a hearing upon the master's report and
the testimony taken before him and upon a stipulation as to
facts, entered into between the parties. The facts reported by
the master are, among others, the following:
There has existed in the city of Chicago since the year 1882
a voluntary association known as the Chicago Stock Exchange,
composed of brokers having places of business in the vicinity of
the exchange, and who are elected to membership therein in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution and by-laws;
the association is governed by a governing committee composed
of the president of the exchange ex qfLfio, and twenty-four
members, and every member is required to sign the constitution
and by-laws, or assent thereto in writing, and obligate himself
to abide thereby and by the rules theretofore or thereafter to
be adopted.
Article 11 of the constitution provides as follows:
"SEC.

1. No fictitious sales shall be made.

Any member

contravening this section shall, upon conviction, be suspended
by the governing committee.

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

"SEC. 9. Any member who shall make fictitious or trifling
bids or offers or who shall offer to buy or sell any stock or security other than government bonds at a less variation than one
eighth of one per cent shall, upon conviction, be subject to suspension, or such other penalty as the governing committee shall
impose."
Article 29 is as follows:
"Any member of this exchange who is interested in or associated with, or whose office is connected directly or indirectly
by wire or other method or contrivance, with any organization,
firm or individual engaged in the business of dealing in differences or quotations on the fluctuations in the market price of
any commodity or security without a bonaflde purchase or sale
of said commodity or security in a regular market or exchange,
shall, on conviction thereof, be deemed to have committed an
act or acts detrimental to the interest and welfare of the exchange."
Articles 16 and 17 of the by-laws read as follows:
" ARTICLE XVI.

"SEc. 1. In any contract either party may call at any time
during the continuance of the same for a deposit of ten dollars
per share upon the par value of the securities bought and sold;
and whenever the market price of the securities shall change
so as to reduce the margin of said deposit, either way below
the ten dollars, either party may call for a deposit sufficient to
restore the margin to ten dollars, and this may be repeated as
often as the margin may be so reduced. In all cages where
deposits are called they shall be made within one banking hour
from the time of such call.
. "Sxc. 2. In case either party shall fail to comply with the.
demand for a deposit in accordance with the provisions of this
article, the party calling, after having given due notice, may
report the default to an-officer of the exchange, who shall repurchase or resell the security forthwith in the exchange, and
any difference that may accrue shall be paid over to the party
entitled thereto. The notice above referred to shall be either
personal or shall be left in writing at the office of the party to

be notified, or in case he has no office, then by public announcement whenever the exchange may be in session.
"AnTIoLE XVII.

"Should any member neglect to fulfill his contract on the
day it becomes due, the party or parties contracting with him
shall, after giving notice as required by section 2 of the pre-,
ceding article, employ an officer of the board to close the same
forthwith in the exchange by purchase or sale as the case may
require, unless the price of settlement has been agreed upon by'.
the contracting parties. In case of a failure of a creditor to
close the contract as above, the price shall be fixed by the price
current at the time such contract ought to have been closed
under the rule. In all cases where an officer may be directed
to buy or sell securities under this rule, the name of the member
defaulting, as well as that of the member giving the order,
shall be announced. No order for the purchase or sale of securities under this rule shall be executed unless made out in
writing over the signature of the party giving the order, who
shall state the reason therefor; .and it shall be the duty of the
officer who executes the order to indorse thereon the name of
the purchaser or seller, the price and the hour at which the
contract is closed, and hand the same to the secretary of the
board, who shall within twenty-four hours ascertain whether
the party for whose account the order was given has paid the
difference, if any, arising from the transaction; if not, the seeretary shall report the default to the president. The duty
devolved upon the officers of the exchange under this rule shall
be performed without charge. No party shall be permitted to
supply offers to buy or sell securities closed for his account
under the rule; and when a contract is closed under this rule,
any action of the defaulter, direct or indirect, by which the
prompt fulfillment of such contract is delayed, hindered or
evaded, to the detriment of the other contracting party, shall
subject the offending party to suspension for not less than
thirty days in the discretion of the governing committee, by a
vote of two thirds of the members present at the meeting.
voL. cLxxx-30

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

When contracts are closed out under the rule, any member
supplying the bid or offer, and not duly receiving or delivering
the stock, as the case may be, renders himself liable to prosecution under this article. Should any stock thus sold not be delivered until the next day, the contract shall continue, but the
defaulting party shall not be liable to pay such damage as may
be assessed by the arbitration committee. The same rules as
to notice, time and places that govern defaults in other contracts shall apply to borrowed securities, which on non-delivery
or receipt, must be borrowed or loaned in open market, except
in case of actual default in receiving or delivering after notice
to close the loan; then the same are to be bought or sold, as
the case may be, for account of the defaulter in the manner
provided in this article."
The rules of the clearing house in regard to buying or selling
for "the account" (under which these transactions were had)
read as follows:
"'ClearingHouse RuZes.

"SEc. 3. All purchases and sales ' for the account' shall be entered upon the blanks furnished by the manager sealed for that
purpose, and said blanks properly filled out, balanced, accompanied by a proof-sheet, and signed, must be delivered to said

at the manager's office. Parties in error must at once proceed
to adjust the same and correct their statements. All balances

"SEC. 5. At or before 9:45 A. M. parties who have not borrowed or loaned their stock balances for ' the account' shall

:New York or in transit for Chicago, three days' grace will be
given the seller to make the delivery with interest, failing in
which the clearing house committee shall cause to be purchased
for account of delinquent said stock in whichever market in their
judgment seems best; and the party so failing to deliver shall
be held responsible for all loss or damage arising therefrom,
but when a failure to receive or deliver occurs, nothing in these
notifications shall be construed to relieve the last contracting
parties to the transaction from the liabilities to each other.
"SEC. 7. Whenever a member fails to pay the balance due on

presiding officer of the exchange.
"SEc. 12. The margin to be deposited on stocks trading in

per share, and on all stocks selling' under $100 per share, the
marginshall be- $5 per share.

until the trades and substitutions are all made and notice posted
to that effect by the manager of the clearing house.

house, the balance, if any, shall be held for a period not exceeding ten days, as a trust, fund for a .pro Pat distribution among
other creditors, who are members of the Chicago Stock Exchange."
The master further reported the facts relating to the sales in
dispute as follows:
"That such rules and by-laws being in force, complainants,
on the 16th day of July, 1896, wired their brokers, Schwartz,
Dupee & Company, as follows:
"' Sell 500 Diamond Match at 2201 for account;' which Was
done; that later on the same day said brokers wired complain-.
ants as follows:
"' Sold 500 Diamond Match at 2211 for the account.'
"That on the.20th day of July, 1896, said brokers received
telegram from complainants. as follows:
"' Sell 200 Diamond Match at 221 for the account at opening
of market.'
"That later on the same day said brokers wired complainants as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

'Sold 200 Diamond Match at 2211 for the account.'
"That on the 25th day of July, 1896, complainants wired
said brokers as follows:
"'Change the Diamond Match over to August account at
2J%. If you cannot do it let us know at once.'
"That shortly after on the same day complainants wired
said brokers as follows:
"'You sent us the difference this morning at 22 ; at what
difference can you do it now?'
"That later on the same day complainants wired *said brokers as follows:
"' Change the 500 at 2 cents or better.'
"That afterwards, and about 12 o'clock on the same day,
said brokers wired complainants as follows:
"' Bought Diamond Match 227 for the account ; sold 500, 229
account 2d.'
"That on July 27th complainants wired said brokers as fol-.
lows:
"' Change 200 more Diamond Match 2% or better.'
"Later on the same day said brokers wired complainants as
follows:
"' We changed thb 200 Match at 21 difference. Will give
you price later.'
"And shortly afterwards on the same day said brokers wired
complainants as follows:
"' Bought 200 Match 2261, account; sold 200 second account
229.'
"That these purchases on July account balanced the sales
on July account and left the brokers with sales made for complainants of 700 shares of the stock of the Diamond Match
Company for the August account; that on the 3d day of August the clearing department of said stock exchange sent to
Schwartz, Dupee & Company, and Jamieson & Company, clearing house sheets as follows."
Here follow copies of the sheets; that of Schwartz & Company showed that all trades on their sheet had been settled,
with the exceptions therein stated, among which were 1150
shares of Diamond Match Company's stock at $222, for which

CLEWS v. JAMESON.
Statement of the Case.

Jamieson & Company had been substituted as buyers; the notice
to Jamieson & Company from the clearing department contained
a like statement, showing that Jamieson & Company had bought
1150 shares of Diamond Match stock at $222, Schwartz &
Company being substituted as sellers.
The 1150 shares-of Diamond Match stock at $222 were made
up in part of 700 shares sold by Schwartz & Company upon
August account for the complainants, and the substitution of
Jamieson & Company for the parties to whom such 700 shares
had been originally sold was made by the clearing department
of said stock exchange according to its uniform custom.
The master also found that Jamieson & Company had settled
with Schwartz & Company for 450 shares of the 1150 shares
referred to between those parties on the clearing house sheet
of August 3, 1896, but that such settlemeni did not include
the 700 shares in question in this case.
The master further found as to the manner of making sales
"for the account :"
"That the method of doing business on said exchange is as
follows: At ten o'clock there is an official call at which the
secretary and manager call all the stocks, bonds and securities
on the official printed list, and as this call progresses, any member wishing to buy or sell, bids thereon, and the record is made
of the transaction; after which there is an irregular call, which
closes at half-past one, when the manager of the clearing house
announces the clearing house or settlement pricer for the day,
which are the closing prices on the exchange for the respective
stocks and securities; that the manager then substitutes trades
and sends out cards to all buying or selling on account for the
current month, or for the next month; that on the 25th of the.
month and thereafter until the second day before the end of
the month, two calls are made, one for the current month and
one for the next ensuing month, and this is done t o allow those
who wish to do so to change their accounts over to the next
month. That this substitution was made by the clearing department by a system somewhat similar to that employed by
the clearing house for banks, that is, that where a broker has

OCTOBER TERM, *1900.
Statement of the Case.

Purchased and sold during the day the same amount of the
sarpe kind of stocks or bonds, his account is balanced by the
clearing department, and all -margins deposited by such broker
may be withdrawn; that when sales and purchases are made
by different brokers, one buying and the other selling, the same
kind of stocks or bonds, a substitution is made by the manager
of the clearing department, by which it appears that the broker
selling has sold such stock, not to the person to whom it was
originally sold, but to a person or persons other than those to
whom such sales were originally made, and who originally
bought of some one else, and that a broker purchasing stock
has purchased from some broker other than the broker from
'whom he originally purchased the same; for instance, if A had.
sold 100 shares of stock to X, and B has bought the same amount
of the same stock from Y, and X and Y's accounts are balanced
by other transactions, the substitution would make it appear that
A had sold 100 shares to B, and B had bought 100 shares from
A, and the names of the parties with whom the original transactions had actually been made by A and B would not appear
on the clearing house sheet; that in the transactions on said
exchange it is then customary for the parties thus substituted
and brought into the relation of buyer and seller with each
other by the manager, to assent to the new relations thus
formed, and to confirm the transactions as thus adjusted by
the manager, and to put up the margins required by the rules,
unless margins are already on deposit in the exchange, in which
cases they are transferred by the manager to the new account.
"IV. That being advised of the substitution on account, as
aforesaid, said Schwartz, Dupee & Company, and said Jamieson
-& Company on said 3d day of August, 1896, exchanged trad
ing cards with each other, on which appears the following:

"That these cards were handed by the parties receiving them
to the clearing house department, so that it appeared at the
close of business on said 3d day of August, by the clearing
sheet, that Schwartz, Dupee & Company had sold to Jamieson
& Company on account, for August, 1150 shares of the stock
of the Diamond Match Company, 700 shares of which are the
stock in controversy in this case, delivery of which under rule 2
of the clearing house was to be made-on the last day of August,
1896; that Schwartz, Dupee & Company and Jamieson & Company each deposited with the said clearing house, seven thousand
dollars, as margins on said 00 shares of stock, which amount
is still held by the said stock exchange, in trust.
"V. That on the 3d day of August, 1896, the governing
committee, of which defendant Jamieson was then em offlcio
president, by virtue of his being then president of said exchange,
held a meeting at which the following resolution was adopted,
the said defendant Jamieson voting in favor of its adoption:
"'1ReS8oved, That the exchange adjourn on Tuesday morning,

the 4th instant, and remain closed pending further action by
this committee.
"That pursuant to said action, said exchange did not open

on said August 4, or thereafter, until the 5th day of- November,
1896.
"VI. That on the 31st day of August, 1896, Schwartz, Dupee
& Company tendered to Jamieson & Company ten certificates
of the stock of the Diamond Match Company for one hundred
shares each, and three like certificates 50 shares each, making
1150 shares of said stock, which said Jamieson & Company
examined and refused to receive."
On September 9, 1896, Schwartz & Company wrote the following letter to Jamieson & Company:
"C IooAGo, September 9, 1896.

"Messrs. Jamieson & Co., No. 187 Dearborn street, Chicago,
Illinois.
"Dear Sirs: On August 31, 1896, we tendered you seven
hundred (700) shares of Diamond Match stock in settlement of
sales made by us. The sales made were 500 shares July 25th,
and 200 shares July 27th, 1896, you being substituted through
the clearing house of the Chicago Stock Exchange August 3,
1896, as the purchaser of the said stock.
"This is to notify you that said sales were made by us as
agents for Henry Clews & Co. of New York, who may rightfully take any proceedings to enforce the contracts for said
sales and who are authorized to make settlements therefor.
"Very truly yours,
"SctwARTz, DUPEE & Co."
(This tender of the T00 shares was part of the total tender
made to Jamieson & Company on the 1150 shares sold them.)
The complainants on the next day (the 10th of September)
gave Jamieson & Company notice in writing of their intention
to sell 700 shares of Diamond Match Company stock, at public
sale, to the highest bidder, and named the place and time, and
that they would hold Jamieson & Company responsible for any
loss on the sale on account of the contracts.
It was further admitted "that Schwartz, Dupee & Company
have no claim whatever of any kind or character against the
fourteen thousand dollars, seven thousand dollars of which was
respectively contributed by Schwartz, Dupee & Company and

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Statement of the Case.

Jamieson & Company to the clearing house of -the Chicago
Stock Exchange." And it was testified that the $7000 deposited by Schwartz & Company were for the account of complainants, in whom is the real interest in such fund.
The stipulation as to facts signed by the parties for the purpose of the trial contained long and detailed statements of the
actions of Jamieson & Company and Schwartz & Company in
relation to all purchases and sales by them of Diamond Match
Company's stock, for both July and August accounts, whether
between themselves directly or not, and the stipulation ended
with this statement:
"1That the transactions heretobefore set out in this stipulation of purchase and sale of Schwartz, Dupee & Company,
Jamieson & Company and the other brokers whose names are
stated, with the- exception of those transactions which are
marked as substitutions, were had by the brokers on behalf of
different clients or principals whom they represented, and those
transactions, so far as the different principals are concerned ,
were not settled or canceled by any of the substitutions, nor by
any of the settlements between the brokers, except so far as
where ! pne client or principal of a broker was, through such
broker, both a purchaser and a seller.
"In other words, the settlements by substitutions or otherwise through the clearing house were merely settlements between the members of the stock exchange, and were not
settlemehts or cancellations of the contracts between the principals whom the brokers represented and the brokers themselves, except where the same broker had both purchased and
sold for the same client."
It was also admitted that when complainants gave their orders to sell and at the time that they were executed by Schwartz
& Company the latter did not have in their hands any stock of
the Diamond Match Company belonging to the complainants,
nor did Schwartz & Company at any time thereafter have in
their hands any of the'stock of that company, which was the
property of the complainants; that the 1150 shares of capital
stock of the Diamond Match Company tendered to Jamieson
& Company by Schwartz & Company in behalf of complain-

ants, on August 31, 1896, were not the property of the complainants, nor any part thereof; that the 700 shares of stock
alleged to have been sold in the bill of complaint, on September 22, 1896, were not delivered to the alleged purchaser after
the sale, but were deivered to J. W. Conley, a member of the
firm of Schwartz & Company by the individual who conducted
the sale on behalf of the complainants, for safekeeping by Conley.
The stock tendered belonged to Schwartz & Company, who
tendered it on behalf and for the benefit of complainants.
The various facts set forth in the stipulation form a somewhat
complicated mass of detail, and, when taken in connection
with the oral evidence and the findings of the master, it is not
clear that they are all perfectly consistent.
Upon the hearing before the master, Mr. Joseph R. Wilkins,
the secretary and chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange
and manager of the clearing house, was cled as a witness in
behalf of the complainants. After giving a statement of the
manner in which business was done on the exchange in relation
to sales for "the account," he testified that the expressions in
the telegrams from the complainants to the brokers, in which
the word "difference" occurred, did not mean the difference
between the then market price of the stock and the contract
price, but meant the charges made for carrying the stock for
the, customer until the next delivery day. The price for this
service differs from day to day, and is matter of agreement for
each transaction; it is in effect the interest charged by the individual who carries the stock, on the amount necessary to carry
it until the next delivery day. The rate of -interest differs, of
course, according to the demand, and is matter of agreement
between the parties. The charge bears no relation whatever to
the difference between the market price and the contract price
of the stock. He also testified that a sale for "the account"
on any day up to the 25th of the month means a sale of the
stock which has to be delivered and paid for and taken at the
end of the month. In other words, an actual delivery of the stock
is contemplated by such a contract, and if a change from that delivery day to the iiext delivery day, thirty days thereafter, is asked
for, it will depend upon the agreement of the parties upon what

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Counsel for Parties.

terms it shall be made. Re also said that a sale for "the account" under the rules of the exchange assumed that there
might be changes or substitutions of names during the period
between the sale and the delivery day, and this happened by
reason of the clearing house custom, under which all the sheets
showing the transactions of the brokers in the sales and purchases in a given stock during the day were examined in the
clearing house and the sheets balanced, so that at-the end it appears there are a certain number of shares sold and the same
number bought, and if the sheets do not balance the Work stops
and does not go on until a balance is made. After the balance
is arrived at the substitution of names takes place, and the tickets
or cards are sent to the brokers who are "long" and "short" of
the stock respectively, and they then send to each other cards
confirming the sale each day, and the cash deposit with the committee is added to by the one side and taken from by the other,
according to the fluctuation of the stock, so that the full amount
of deposit is kept at all times with the committee until the
transaction is closed.
In regard to the fluctuations of price from day to day and
the manner in which a party selling or buying at a certain
price finally obtains or pays it on delivery day, although the
original purchaser may have substituted another name at a different price, the witness explained that such original price was
realized by means of the margin in the hands of the committee,
which was added to daily by the party against whom the price
of the stock turned, and drawn from by the party in whose
favor it turned, so that, taking such payments and adding
the price the stock actually sold for on the delivery day, the
party selling or purchasing obtains his original selling or purchase price, which results in a loss or a gain, as the price of the
stock on delivery day is higher or lower than the original contract price.

MLR. JUSTICE PEoKH", after making the above statement of
facts, delivered the opinion of the court.

It is contended that there is an adequate and complete remedy at law for any liability that may arise by reason of the
transactions above set forth, and that therefore the bill was
properly dismissed and the decree of dismissal should be affirmed by this court.
It is undisputed that the defendants, the governing committee of the stock exchange, have in their hands the sum of
$14,000, the absolute title to which they do not claim. That
sum was deposited with them by Schwartz & Company and
Jamieson & Company, each depositing-one half, for the purpose
of thereby securing the performance of the contract entered into
by those parties, and which sum was only to be taken from the
possession of the governing committee for the purpose of fulfilling the condition upon which its deposit with the committee
was made. As that committee had no personal interest in or
title to the fund and it was placed in its possession in the trust
and confidence that it would see that the purposes of the deposit
were fulfilled and the moneys paid out only in accordance with
the terms of the trust under which it was deposited, there can
be no question that the fund thereby became a trust fund in
the possession of the governing committee and the disposition
of which in accordance with the trust those members were
called upon to secure. The complainants claim that pursuant
to the conditions of the trust they are entitled to the money
deposited with the committee. It is shown that the money
deposited by Schwartz & Company was deposited by them for
and in behalf of the complainants, and Schwartz & Company
lay no claim to the fund or any portion of it. Complainants
demanded from the committee the payment of the whole fund
to them on the ground that they were entitled to such payment

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court..

by the terms of the trust, and because of the violation of the
contract by Jamieson & Company, to secure which the latter
deposited $7000 of the fund in question. The committee has
refused to pay over any portion of this fund to complainants,
although it lays no claim to it, or any portion of it, on its own
behalf. There is a dispute in regard to the right of the cornplainants to any portion of this fund, and a refusal on the part
of the committee to pay it aver to them. By reason of the
facts, the committee occupied, from the time of the deposit of
the funds, a fiduciary relation towards the parties depositing
it, and it became a-trustee of the fund charged with the duty
of seeing that it was applied in conformity with the provisions
creating it.
Pomeroy in his work on Equity Jurisprudence, second edition, instances, among other equitable estates and interests
which come within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, those
of trusts. In volume one, at section 151, he says: "The whole
system fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of chancery; the
doctrine of trusts became and continues to be the most efficient
instrument in the hands of a chancellor for maintaining justice,
good faith, and good conscience; and it has been extended so
as to embrace not only lands, but chattels, -funds of every kind,
things in action, and moneys."
All possible trusts, whether express or implied, are within
the jurisdiction of the chancellor. In this case the committee,
as trustee, was charged with the performance of some active
and substantial duty in respect to the management and pay-.
ment of the funds in its hands,-and it was its duty to see that
the objects of its creation were properly accomplished. The
fact that the relief demanded is a recovery of money only is
not important in deciding the question as to the jurisdiction of
equity. The remedies which such a court may give "depend
upon the nature and object of the trust; sometimes they are specific in their character, and of a kind which the law courts cannot administer, but often they.are of the same general kind as
those obtained in legal actions, being mere recoveries of money.
A court of equity will always, by its decree, declare the iights,
interest or estate of the cemti jue tru' , and will compel the

OCTOBER TERMI, 190Q.
Opinion of the. Court.

trustee to do all the specific acts required of him by the terms
of the trust. It often happens that the fnaZ relief, to be obtained by the cestui gue tru8t consists in the recovery of money.
This remedy the courts of equity will always decree when
necessary, whether it is confined to the payment of a single
specific sum, or involves an accounting by the trustee for all
that he has done in pursuance of the trust, and a distribution
of the trust moneys among all the beneficiaries who are entitled to share $herein." 1 Pom. Eq. Tur. sec. 158.
In cases where the equity doctrine of trusts has been extended so is to embrace other relations of a fiduciary kind,
while it may not be said that a court of equity possesses exclusive jurisdiction, yet it is well settled that in such case there
is so much of the trust character between the parties so situated
that the jurisdiction of equity, though not exclusive, is acknowIedged. 1 Pom. Eq. Jur. see. 157.
In FoZey v. Hill, 2 H. L. Cas. 28, a question arose over that
sort of relation which exists between -a banker and his depositor, and it was held to be merely that of debtor and creditor.
The court added however that, as between principal and factor,
an equitable jurisdiction attached, because the latter partook of
the character of a trustee, and that "so it is with regard to an
agent dealing with any property.

.

.

.

And though he is

not a trustee according to the strict technical meaning of the
word, he is quasi a trustee for that particular transaction," and,
therefore, equity has jurisdiction.
In ]farvin v. Broo, 94 N. Y. 71, it was held that an agent
who had been entrusted with his principal's money to be expended for a specific purpose might be required to account in
equity, and that upon such an accounting the burden was upon
him to show that his trust duties had been performed and the
manner of their performance. The jurisdiction was placed
upon the ground of a fiduciary or trust relation, and it was held
that a court of equity had jurisdiction over trusts and those
fiduciary relations which partake of that character, and in such
cases the right to an accounting is well established; but it was
held that the existence of a bare agency was not sufficient. It

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court,

must be an agency coupled with some distinct duty on the part
of the agent in relation to funds or some specific property.
In 2 Story's Eq. Jur. (12th ed.) it is stated, at section 975a,
that in general a trustee is suable in equity in regard to any
matters touching the trust.
• In OeZlic7h v. Spain, 15 Wall. 211, 228, the court remarked
that there being an element of trust in the case, that element,
wherever it existed, always confers jurisdiction in equity.
That the governing committee could file a bill of interpleader
against the complainants and the other defendants, alleging
that each claimed the fund, or some portion thereof, and ask
the court to determine which of the parties was entitled to the
same, furnishes no reason for excluding the jurisdiction of
equity in this case.
It may be somewhat doubtful whether an action against these
defendants could be maintained at law, the cofitract not being
originally between Schwartz & Company and Jamieson & Company, but only becoming so by way of substitution under the
rules of the clearing house, and the relief sought being different between the two sets of defendants, Jamieson & Company
and the members of the governing committee of the stock exchange. The maintenance of this suit enables the whole question between all the parties to be determined therein, and prevents the necessity of any action at law or other proceeding in
the courts for the purpose of determining the ultimate and final
rights of all the parties to this suit. Such relief cannot be
obtained in any one action at law.
Upon all the facts we think that the jurisdiction of the court
was plainly established, because under the circumstances the
complainants had no adequate and full remedy at law.
We are then brought to the question• decided by the Circuit
Court, which held that there was no privity of contract between
-the complainants and Jarnieson & Company. Aside from the
general rule that a party sending an order to a broker doing
business in an established market or trade for a transaction in
that trade, thereby confers upon the broker authority to deal according to any well-settled usage in such trade or market,
Blibb v. Allen, 149 U. S.481, 489, it plainly appears in this case
VOL. cLxxxII-31

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

from the pleadings that the sales and purchases of stock were
in fact made subject to the rules of the exchange, the complainants alleging in their bill that such was the fact, while the
defendants Jamieson & Company in their answer make a like
claim.
All the transactions regarding the sales and purchases of the
various shares of stock mentioned in this case must, therefore,
be regarded as having taken place with direct reference and
subject to those rules.
The Circuit Court did not question that upon the facts stated
a contract came into existence whereby primarily Schwartz &
Company were obliged to sell to Jamieson & Company 700
shares of the stock named at the price of $222 per share, and it
found no difficulty in holding that the undisclosed principals of
either of these parties were entitled to step into the places of
these respective brokers, and in their own name and for their
own benefit insist upon the enforcement of the contract according to its terms; that under the rules of the exchange each of
the brokers bound himself to the other broker and the principals
whom the other broker represented to carry out the terms of
the contract, but the court held that the evidence disclosed that
Schwartz & Company were only clothed with the authority to
sell the stock at $229, and that their principals, the complainants
herein, were not bound by a sale at any figure less than that
sum, and that neither Schwartz & Company nor any persons
with whom that firm had contracted could have compelled the
complainants to deliver the stock at a price less than $229. As
the fact appeared that the contract between the respective
brokers was for a sale at $222, the defendants Jamieson & Company, even under the substitution provided for by the rules of
the stock exchange, could not hold complainants as principals
of the, contract for a sale at that price, and the court held that
for want of mutuality the complainants are in no position to
hold those defendants; that there was no identity of contract
between the one the complainants authorized and the one entered
into between the brokers, and the fact that the complainants
now choose to accept it is of no consequence, the legal fact remained that they are not so bound, and, not being so bound,

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

the defendants Jamieson & Company on their part are not
legally bound.
In this case, although the brokers on the exchange acted in
their own name, yet in fact each acted for undisclosed principals. In regard to 700 shares Schwartz & Company acted
for the complainants,. and in regard to 450 shares they acted 'in
behalf of other clients. If the contract had been for the sale
and purchase of these shares at $229, there would have been
no difficulty in the case upon the principle adopted by the Circuit Court. The bar to a recovery lay in the alleged fact that
the sale was without authority, although really procured by
Schwartz & Company while acting as agents of the complainants.
A principal can adopt and ratify an unauthorized act of his
agevt who in fact is assuming to act in his behalf, although
not disclosing his agency to others, and when it is so ratified it
is as if the principal had given an original authority to that
effect and the ratification relates back to the time of the act
which is ratified. He must disavow the act of his agent within
a reasonable time after the fact has come to his knowledge,
or he. will be deemed to have ratified it. Bringing a suit
upon the contract of his agent which was unauthorized at the
.time and in excess of the authority conferred upon the agent
is a ratification of the unauthorized act; and it is no answer to
the ratification that prior to its taking place the principal is
not bound, and hence there is no right on the part of the other
party to enforce as against him the unauthorized act of his
agent. These principles are well known, and may be found
laid down in the following text books and authorities: Story
on Agency, 9th ed. sec. 90, note 7; secs. 248, 251 and 251a, and
note; sees. 258, 259; Livermore on Agency, page 44; Dunlap's

207, 218, 219 ; Cooke v. TulW8s, 18 Wall. 332, 338.
Therefore if in fact the sale at $222 had been unauthorized

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

on the part of Schwartz & Company, the subsequent ratification
of their unauthorized act by the complainants was the same as
a precedent authority to them.. The failure of the complainants
to repudiate the action of their agents in the sale immediately
after it was reported to them would operate as a ratification.
They not only failed to repudiate, but actually approved the
action, and notified the defendants Jamieson & Company that
the sales made by Schwartz & Company to the extent of 700
shares of stock had been made for them, and that they should
hold Jamieson & Company liable upon the contract and for
any damage caused by its violation.
It is argued, however, on the part of complainants that there
was no unauthorized action by Schwartz & Company, and in
proof thereof an explanation is given and an argument made
founded thereon in relation to the peculiar facts which attend
the sale and purchase of stock on "the account" .on the floor of
the stock exchange at Chicago. The very term itself imports,
as is stated and as the evidenjce shows, a sale of stock to be delivered at a future time, and under the rules of the exchange
that time means the last day of the month in which the sale or
purchase is made.
Under these same rules, when an agreement to sell for future
delivery is effected, each party places a margin in the hands of
the governing committee for the purpose of securing the performance of the contract, and, as is set forth in the foregoing
statement of facts, this sum is kept intact in the hands of the committee until the final closing of the transaction, and upon a sale
for "the account" the fluctuation in the price of the stock is
provided for by payment into the fund upon the part of the one
against whom the price of the stock has turned, and by drawing out of that same fund by the party in whose favor the price
was, and so at the delivery day, whatever the price may be, the
party selling gets the market price of the stock on that day, and
the difference between that and the contract price he has received by payments into the fund in the hands of the governing
committee by the other party and his withdrawal of the same
sums, making in that way the contract price of the stock.
Ilence, it is argued, on the part of complainants that the sale

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

at $222 was entirely proper, and in accordance with the pre.
vious authority given complainants' agents, because the differ:
ence between $229 and $222 complainants' agents had already
received by a draft drawn upon the fund in the hands of the
governing committee. This is upon the assumption that there
had been a margin put up by the parties to the sales on the
July account in accordance with the rules, which had been carried over to the August account, and that into this deposit the
money had been paid as the stock dropped from July 25 to
August 3, and Schwartz & Company had drawn the same out.
If this plainly appeared in the testimony, the findings or the
stipulation of the parties, it would be an answer to the contention that the act of Schwartz & Company in selling at $222 was
unauthorized. It is, however, answered on the part of Jamieson & Company that there is no evidence that this fund had
been drawn from and paid into by the respective parties, and
hence there is no basis of fact appearing in the record upon
which the argument can rest. Counsel allege that the statements on the part of the complainants are at variance with the
conceded facts in the ease. They say in the first place that the
bill itself avers that this deposit was made when the contract
of August 3 for 1150 shares, was entered into, and that the
answers of the governing committee and of Jamieson & Company expressly state that the deposit was made on that day.
If this fund were not created until August 3, it could not have
been drawn from by the agents of complainants in the July
previous, and so it would be impossible for the complainants to
have received moneys from that fund prior to that date. Although the rules of the stock exchange require the deposit of
these margins, and in cases where a sale for "the account" has
been changed from one month to the following, the rules and
the pradtice of the exchange require that the deposit on the
-old account shall be transferred to the new, yet still it is said
that the rules or practice requiring such deposit cannot supply
the place of evidence of a fact when the pleadings expressly
state the opposite.
I It seems to us quite evident, after a perusal of the whole
record and from the manner in which the case was tried, that it

486

OCTOBEVR TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

was assumed that a deposit of the moneys for the first July
sales was made and that such deposit remained and went over
into the new account of and for August delivery, although such
assumed fact may be inconsistent with the allegation in the pleadings in regard to the date of the deposit, which was alleged to
be August 3. There is perhaps this technical inconsistency, yet
assuming it to be as claimed on the part of counsel for Jamieson & Company, it does not touch the fact that the complainants ratified the action of their agents, Schwartz & Company,
in selling at $2.22.
Aside from these questions, however, it is claimed on the part
of Jamieson & Company fhat the record shows there never was
any privity of contract between these parties, complainants on
the one side, and Jamieson & Company on the other, because
there were contracts on the part of Schwartz & Company for
other dealers in the same stock, and that such contracts were
not dosed on August 3. Their claim is, even assuming that on
August 3, Schwartz & Company contracted to sell to Jamieson
& Company 1150 shares of stock at $222, deliverable August 31,
the record shows that the complainants were not alone the interested parties to that contract. It is averred that 700 shares
of the 1150 shares sold by Schwartz & Company to Jamieson
& Company, on August 3, were for the account of the complainants, but it also appears that of the 1150 shares, 450 were
sold for the account of others. These latter shares have, however, been settled for between the respective brokers. We are
not concerned with the terms of the settlement or any admission or liabilities resulting therefrom, but the fact of such settlement eliminates all questions in regard to those 450 shares
and leaves the 700 shares remaining, which were the shares
sold by Schwartz & Company as agents for the complainants.
The fact that there were in this sale of August 3 other shares
than the 700, and that in regard to those others some had been
sold originally by Schwartz & Company to other and different
brokers than Jamieson & Company, will not prevent the contract as to the TOO shares from being enforced by complainants
against Jamieson &_Company, although but for such settlement
there might have been some embarrassment in maintaining a suit

CLEWS '. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

against the latter for a portion only of the total shares sold them,
while the other portion was represented by different clients of
Schwartz & Company. The splitting up of the contract into
two or more claims in behalf of different principals of Schwartz
& Company and bringing different suits by the different principals agaiiist Jamieson & Company, on the single contract, might
be in violation of the general rule refusing to recognize such
right, but where all other claims have been settled and there
remains but the one demand against the defendants, the objection does not apply, and we see no reason why the complainants may not take advantage of the contract made by
their agents and enforce the same against Jamieson & Company.
Selling " for the account " is not an invention of the Chicago
Stock Exchange. It has been practiced upon the London and
the New York and other stock exchanges for many years, and
the general rules governing it are much the same on all of them.
Thus it is said in Dos Passos on Stock Brokers and Stock Exchanges, page 276, as follows:
"It also appears in accordance with the usages of the stock
exchange that the broker may, in executing the order of a client,
enter into a contract for the specific amount of stock ordered
to be bought or sold, or may include such order with others he
may have received in a contract for the entire quantity, or in
quantities at his convenience.
"Neither in stock exchange contracts is there any real appropriation to any particular client of any particular stock in any
transaction entered into with the jobber. Each transaction only
forms an item in an account-with that jobber, or, more correctly,
with the house generally-that is to say, specific delivery or
acceptance of that amount of stock is not necessarily made; but
the .transaction is liable to be balanced at any time during that
account by a counter transaction by the same broker on behalf
of the same or any client, or even on his own behalf, so that
the balance only of all purchases and sales of that particular
stock made by the broker in the house generally is to be finally
accepted or delivered by him, and this through the instrumentality of the clearing house and the system of tickets."

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

The rules of the Chicago exchange clearly contemplate and
provide for a substitution of names between the selling and the
delivery days, and each party is kept secured by the margin
originally put up, which is added to and taken from as the stock
fluctuates in price from day to day. Hence it may be that the
parties buying or selling may by virtue of this rule be liable to
different principals represented in one original contract between
the brokers. Whatever the rules or practice of the exchange
may be, it is of course plain that no principal can be held to the
performance of a contract which he never made, authorized or
ratified. The stipulation made between the parties relating to
this matter, while not entirely plain, might affect the right to
maintain this action but for the fact~that all other claims were
settled, leaving only the controversy regarding the 700 shares
to be disposed of between these parties. Upon the facts before
us we think there was sufficient privity of confract between
them to sustain this suit.
The viqv taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals in regard to
this case was that the contracts were void as being in violation of
the terms of the Illinois statute, sections 130 and 131, which
are set forth in the margin.' It is a very far-reaching decision,
1 SEc. 130. Whoever contracts to have or give to himself or another the
option to sell or buy, at a future time, any grain or other commodity, stock
of any railroad or other company, or gold, or forestalls the market by spreading false rumors to influence the price of commodities therein, or corners
the market, or attempts to do so in relation to any such commodities, shall
be fined not less than $10 nor more than $1000 or confined in the county
jail not exceeding one year, or both; and all contracts made in violation of
this section shall be considered gambling contracts, and shall be void.
SEc. 131. All promises, notes, bills, bonds, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, mortgages, or other securities or conveyances made,
given, granted, drawn or entered into, or executed by any person whatsoever, where the whole or any part of the consideration thereof shall be for
any money, property or other valuable thing, won by any gaming or playing
at cards, dice or other game or games, or by betting on the side or hands
of any person gaming, or by wager or bet upon any lace, fight, pastime,
sport, lot, chance, casualty, election or unknown or contingent event whatever, or for the reimbursing or paying any money or property knowingly
lent or advanced at the time or place of such play or bet, to any person or
persons so gaming or betting, or that shall, during such play or betting, so
play or bet, shall be null and void and of no effect.

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

and if followed would ihvalidate most transactions of every stock
exchange in the country "for the account." We are unable to
agree with the opinion of the court on this question.
"The generally accepted doctrine in this country is, as stated
by Mr. Benjamin, that a contract for the sale of goods to be
delivered at a future day is valid, even though the seller has not
the goods, nor any other means of getting them than to go into
the market and buy them; but such a contract is only valid
when the parties really intend and agree that the goods are to
,be delivered by the seller and the price to be paid by the buyer;
and, if under guise of such a contract, the real intent be merely
to speculate in the rise or fall of prices, and the goods are not
to be delivered, but one party is to pay the other the difference
between the contract price and the market price of the goods
at the date fixed for executing the contract, then the whole
transaction constitutes nothing more than a wager, and is null
and void."
This quotation with the doctrine therein stated is approved
in Irwin v. IVlliar, 110 U. S. 499, 508.
As a sale for future delivery is not on its face void, but is a
perfectly legal and valid contract, it must be shown by him
who attacks it that it was not intended to deliver the article
sold, and that nothing but the difference between the contract
and the market price was to be paid by the parties to the contract. And the fact that at the time of making a contract for
future delivery the party binding himself to sell has not the
goods in his possession and has no means of obtaining them for
delivery, otherwise than by purchasing them after the contract
is made, does not invalidate the contract. Hibblewhite v. -fc-Yorine, 5 M. & W. 462. Parke, Alderson and Maule, barons,
before whom the case was heard, were unanimously of this
opinion.
In order to invalidate a contract as a wagering one, both
parties must intend that instead of the delivery of the article
there shall be a mere payment of the difference between the
contract and the market price. Pearce v. Rice, 142 U. S. 28;
Pickering v. Cea§e, 79 Illinois, 328. In the latter case it was
stated:

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

"Agreements for the future delivery of grain, or any other
commodity, are not prohibited by the common law, nor by any
statute of the State, nor by any policy adopted for the protec,
tion of the public. What the law does prohibit, and what is
deemed detrimental to the general welfare, is speculating in
differenues in market values. The alleged contracts for August
and September come within this definition. No grain was ever
bought and paid for, nor do we think it was ever expected any
would be called for, nor that any would have been delivered
had demand been made. What were these but 'optional contracts,' in the most objectionable sense; that is, theseller had
the privilege of delivering or not delivering, and the buyer the
privilege of calling or not calling for the grain, just as they
chose. On the maturity of the contracts, they were to be filled
by adjusting the differences in the market values. Being in
the nature of gambling transactions, the law will tolerate no
such contracts."
And in Pearce v. Rice, 142 U. S. 28, 40, it was remarked:
"But the evidence before us is overwhelming to the effect
that the real object of the arrangement between Hooker &
Company and Foote was, not to contract for the actual delivery,
in the future, of grain or other commodities-which contracts
would not have been illegal (Pickeringv. Cease, 79 Illinois, 328,
330)-but merely to speculate upon the rise and fall in prices,
with an explicit understanding, from the outset, that the property apparently contracted for was not to be delivered, and
that the transactions were to be closed only by the payment of
the differences between the contract price and the market price
at the time fixed for the execution of the contract."
A contract which is on its face one of sale with a provision
for future delivery, being valid, the burden of proving that it
is invalid, as being a mere cover for the settlement of "differences," rests with the party making the assertion. A defence
of the illegality of the contract was pleaded by the defendant
in Cothran v. Ellis, 125 Illinois, 496. In speaking of the burden of proof the court (at page 506) said:
"The facts alleged in the defendant's pleas, and put in issue
by the plaintiff's traverse, are the only controverted facts in this

CLEWS v. JAMESON.
Opinion of the Court.

case, and the onus robmadi was upon the defendant. If the
latter had offered no evidence at all, it would not have been
necessary for the plaintiff to offer any, for the jury are always
bound to find the facts against the party having the burden of
proof, if he offers no evidence in support of the issues."
In Imwin v. Williar, 110 U. S. 499, 507, the trial judge in substance charged the jury that the burden of showing that the
parties were carrying on a wagering contract and were not engaged in legitimate trade or speculation rests upon the defendant. Contracts for the future delivery of merchandise or stock
are not void, whether such property is in existence in the hands
of the seller or to be subsequently acquired. On their face
these transactions are legal, and the law does not, in the absence
of proof, presume that the parties are gambling. The-proof
must show that there was a mutual understanding that the
transaction was to be a mere settlement of differences; in other
words, a mere wagering contra.et. This charge was approved
by this court, and the principle was again approved in Bibb v.
Allen, 149 U. S. sup'ra.

Taking the contracts in this case as evidenced by the various
telegrams passing between the complainants and their agents,
Schwartz & Company, and having in mind the manner in which
the business was in fact transacted, we are unable to find any
evidence upon which to base a holding that the contracts came
within the statutes of Illinois on the subject of gaming. There
was no proof that there was a mutual understanding that the
transactions were to be settled by a mere payment of "differences," and that there was to be no delivery, nor, in our judgment could any inference to that effect be legitimately drawn
from the undisputed facts. In the first place it is proper to
consider the rules of the stock exchange where the business was
done. We find that article 17 of the constitution provides in
section 1, " that no fictitious sale shall be made. Any member
contravening this section shall upon conviction be suspended by
the governing committee." Article 29 prohibits any member
of the exchange from being interested in or associated with any
organization engaged in the business of dealing in differences
or quotations on the fluctuations in the market price of any

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

commodity or security, without a bon,§de purchase or sale of
said commodity or security in a regular market or exchange.
These two rules provide on their face that no sale for mere collection of differences is allowed; that every sale must be one in
good faith for the delivery, either present or future, of the article sold. Sales "for the account" under the rules are made
upon the basis of an intended actual delivery of the stock at the
time when due. The evidence upon this point is undisputed.
A contract for the mere settlement of differences is a violation of the rules of the organization under which these brokers
were doing business. Neither the rules of the exchange nor
those of the clearing house set forth in the foregoing statement
provide for these wagering contracts. Some of them provide
for the course to be pursued where a member fails to fulfill his
contract. They do not provide as a means for the fulfillment
of such contract the payment of "differences," but point out a
course which the party claiming the fulfillment may pursue as
against the party who violates the contract. :Rule 17 treats
the party failing to fulfill as a defaulter, and his name as a defaulter is announced. Sections 1 and 2 of article 16 provide
for the failure .of either party to keep up his margin, and the
failure is described as a default. To say that such rules afford
strong ground to infer an unddrstanding between the parties
doing business subject to them-that their contract was not one
of actual sale, but merely one to speculate upon "1differences"
-is, in our opinion, to presume an illegal contract against its
plain terms, and without any sound basis for the presumption.
Thus, if an individual agreeing to purchase and pa for certain stock at a future date fails or refuses to perform his contract, the stock is sold under the rule, the price received and
the difference between the price at which it sold and the contract price he is held answerable for. That would be his legal
liability, in any event, and we cannot agree that the rules made
for the case of a violation of contract provide or were intended
to provide a means for its fulfillment. In case of a violation,
the rules merely afford an expeditious means of ascertaining
the amount of the damages. Of course, we do not say that
these rules actually prevent gambling on the exchange. It is

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

possible, if not probable, that gambling may be and is in fact
carried on there, but it must be in violation of and not pursuant to the rules.
Recurring, then, to the terms of these contracts, there is
nothing therein which shows that they were gaming contracts,
and hence in violation of the Illinois statute. They were plain
directions to sell certain named stock for "the a6count," the
meaning of which was that the stock was to be sold for actual
delivery on the next delivery day, being the last day of the
month. Such a direction presumes the intention to deliver the
stock at the time named upon the receipt of the purchase price
thereof as agreed upon at the time of the sale. There is no presumption opposed to this view in the absence of any evidence upon
which it can rest. The fact that at the time of the sale the complainants did not own any of the stock cannot support the presumption, because it is perfectly valid to make such a sale, and an
illegal intent accompanying the performance of a perfectly legal
act cannot be presumed. The subsequent telegrams directing the
changing of the delivery time from the July to"the August account, after inquiring in regard to the difference upon which
such change could be effected, furnish no evidence of any illegal intention in connection either with the original or the
changed contracts.
The "difference," as explained by the testimony, set out in
the foregoing statement, related to the charges to be made for
carrying the stock from the July to the August delivery day,
and did not relate to the payment of any difference between the
contract price and market price of the stock. A direction to
change the 500 shares from the July account to the August account would mean, as Mr. Wilkins, the manager of the stock
exchange, testified, that the party who had agreed to sell 500
shares of stock, deliverable in July, did not wish to deliver on
that day, and the direction to change to the August account
meant that the agents were to buy in that number of shares and
sell them out again for the August account, keeping "short"
the same amount of stock and making the difference in that case
of $2.50 a share, or $250 on every 100 shares of stock, for carrying it for another month, and this charge was the interest which

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court

the party would have to pay to him who was on the other side of
the market and who would carry it to the next delivery day,
30 days thereafter.
There is nothing in the whole transaction from which it can
be reasonably said that at the time when the original July order
to sell was given there was any intention to do otherwise than
make delivery of the stock at the July settlement day, and a
delivery must have been then made by the very terms of the
contract, as also under the rules of the exchange, unless there
might thereafter be a change of that agreement by postponing
the delivery to the August account.' If there were no such subsequent agreement, then the delivery must have been made in
July, but the seller might, in order to make it, enter into another agreement with some one else to take it off his hands upon
such terms as might be agreed upon. There is absolutely no
evidence that these contracts were entered into pursuant to any
understanding whatever that they should be fulfilled by payments of the difference between the contract and the market
price at the time set for delivery. To hold otherwise would entirely prevent any dealing in stocks for "the account," including of course a case where for any reason the delivery day
should be changed from the one originally intended to another
and a future day.
To uphold the rulings of the Circuit Court of Appeals herein
the cases of Pioke ing v. Cease, 79 Illinois, 328; Lyon v. Calbertson, 83 Illinois, 33; Tenney v. Foote, 95 Illinois, 99; Pearce
v. Foote, 113 Illinois, 228 ; Cothran v. Ellis, 125 Illinois, 496 ;
Schneider v. Turner,130 Illinois, 28, and Soby v. The -People,
134 Illinois, 66, have been cited. We have examined them all,
and are unable to see that they justify the ruling herein.
These cases hold these various propositions:
(1) That "option contracts" to sell or deliver grain or other
commodity, or railroad or other stock, which contracts are intended to be settled by payment of differences at the settling
date, are invalid. 79, 83, 113 and 125 Illinois, &z~ra.
(2) A contract to have or give to himself an option to sell or
buy at a future time any grain, etc., subjects the party to fine
or imprisonment, and all contracts made in violation of the stat-

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
)pinion of the Court..

ute are gambling contracts and void under section 130, Criminal
Code, and all notes or securities, part of the consideration of
which is money, etc., won by wager upon an unknown or contingent event, as described in section 131 of the code, are also
void. 95 and 113 Illinois, sspra.
(3) An "option contract" to sell or buy at a future time grain
or other commodity or stock, etc., is void under'the Illinois
statute, even though a settlement by differences was not contemplated. 130 Illinois, gupra.
(4) The keeper of a shop or office where dealing is carried on
in stock, etc., on margins, without any intention of delivering
articles bought or sold, is guilty of an offence under the Illinois
act of 1887. 134 Illinois, 8upra.
The cases of Pearcev. Rice, 142 U. S. supra, and Irwin v.
Williar,110 U. S. 8upra, are referred to in some of these cases as
holding that dealings in differences, where the contract provides
therefor, are void.
These Illinois cases, it will be seen upon examination, do not
touch the case before us, which is a contract for future delivery,
where there is no evidence that such delivery was not contemplated and a settlement by payment of differences only intended.
The "option contracts" spoken of in those cases are explained
in the cases themselves to mean what is commonly called "puts
and calls," where there is no obligation on the part of the person to sell or to buy, and that class of contracts is the class covered by the statute. There is nothing in the evidence in this
record that seems to us to afford any reasonable ground for
holding that the contract in this case was on its face illegal as
in violation of any statute in Illinois, or that, while valid on
its face, the contract was really a guise under which to enable
the parties to gamble on the differences in the price of stock
sold and bought.
The further objection that these contracts having been made
with reference to the rules of the exchange, the parties must in
pursuing a remedy be confined to that which the rules provide,
to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of ordinary courts of justice,
we do not regard as well taken..
The sales were made subject to the rules referred to, but so

Opinion of the Court.

far as regards a remedy for their violation, those rules provide
a means by which parties may seek and obtain relief in accordance with their terms. They do not assume to exclude the
jurisdiction of the courts, or, in other words, they do not assume to provide an ex'clusive remedy which the parties must
necessarily follow, and which they have no right to refuse to
follow without violating such rules, and thereby violating their
contract. Any rule which would exclude the jurisdiction of
the courts over contracts or transactions such as are here shown
would not be enforced in a legal tribunal.
It is also objected that the means taken to obtain a price for
the stock after a tender thereof had been refused by Jamieson
& Company were inadequate for that purpose, if not fraudulent,
and that, hence, there is no proof properly before the court as
to the value of the stock on August 31, when it was tendered,
or September 22, when it was sold, and it is also contended
that there was no fair sale, but a mere sham, colorable in itself
and fraudulent as against the defendants Jamieson & Company;
that the only price of the stocks contemplated in the contracts
at the time they were entered into and in case of a violation
thereof, was the price to be fixed by the stock exchange by
actual sales on the delivery days, and that as the exchange was
closed from August 3 until :November 5 following, no means existed by which that price could be ascertained.
We think the course pursued by the complainants was a
proper one. On August 31, the exchange being closed, Schwartz
& Company, acting in behalf of the complainants, tendered to
Jamieson & Company 1150,shares of the stock in question, 700
of which included the shares sold by them for the complainants. This tender was refused. It is objected that the stock
did not belong to the complainants when tender thereof was
made to Jamieson & Company. That was not material. Their
agents, Schwartz & Company, who did own the stock, made
tender of it to Jamieson & Company and demanded the contract price in payment thereof. If that price had been paid
and the delivery of the stock made to Jamieson & Company it
would have been a good delivery. They would have had the
title to the stock as against every one, Schwartz & Company

CLEWS v. JAMIESON.
Opinion of the Court.

included. It was a matter, therefore, of no importance that
the complainants at the time this stock was tendered did not
have the legal title to it. Under these circumstances, what
could the complainants or their agents, Schwartz & Company,
do? A tender of the stock had been made and had been refused. The stock exchange was closed by order of its governing committee, and Jamieson had voted in favor of its closing.
Were there no means by which the value of the stock at or
about this time could be ascertained while the stock exchange
was closed? We think there were, and we also think that the
course pursued by the complainants was a proper and appropriate one.
Accordingly Jamieson & Company were notified that the
stock would be sold to the highest bidder at a time and place
mentioned, and that they would be held responsible for any
loss that might result from their refusal to take and pay for the
stock as agreed upon. They were also informed at or about
that time that the sales made by Schwartz & Company had
been made for complainants as to 700 of such shares. On the
day named the stock was put up for sale, and it is not an important fact that it did not belong to.the complainants. It was
stock over which they had control, and it was offered for sale
on the part of the complainants with the approval and assent
of its owners, and if it had been bought by any individual at
the sale other than the one who did bid it in such purchaser
would have obtained a good title to the stock on payment of
the price bid. Wide publicity bad been given on the part of
the complainants of the time when and the place where this
sale would occur, and the highest bid was made by an individual who was a member of the firm of Schwartz & Company,
but there were many other people there who had the right, and,
as it appears, were urged to bid, and there was neither fraud
nor deception in the fact that a bid was made by a member of
the firm as stated. The price at which the bidding closed was
fixed after a chance for full and open competition upon the part
of all who were present, and although the complainants entered
into some arrangement with their agents by which the latter
produced th6 stockland offered it for sale on account of and for
voL. cxxxn-32

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
,Opinion of the Court

the complainants, yet no injurious effect upon the transaction
was thereby caused, and it in no way injured Jamieson & Company. That the bid was a fair indication of what was then
regarded as the value of the stock, we think admits of very little question. When the exchange opened in November the
stock sold at $130, and continued near that figure for some
time.
Under all the facts in the case we think the complainants
were justified in the course they pursued, and that the price at
which the stock sold was a fair basis upon which to determine
the amount of damages sustained by the complainant by reason
of the refusal of Jamieson & Company to fulfill their contract
of purchase.
For these reasons the decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals
and the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the case remanded to the latter court for such further proceedings
therein as are not inconsistent with the &opinionof this court,
and it is so ordered.

I dissent from thd opinion and judgment in this case upon
the ground stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, namely, that
the transactions involved in this litigation constituted gambling
in "differences," in violation of the statute of Illinois.
