SUPREME COURT OF THtE UNITED STATES,

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK ex rel.
METROPOLITAN STREET RAILWAY COMPANY v.
NEW YORK STATE BOARD OF TAX COMMISSIONERS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 74.

Argued April 17, 18, 19, 1905.-Decided May 29, 1905.

Presumptively all property within the territorial limits of a State is subject to its taxing power and the burden of proof is on one claiming that
any particular property is by contract or otherwise beyond the reach
thereof; and, growing out of the conditions of modern business a large
proportion of valuable property is now to be found in intangible things
such as franchises, which are, like other property, subject to taxation.
In grants from the public nothing passes by implication, and, in the absence
of direct stipulations relinquishing the right of taxation, a provision,
in grants of privileges or franchises, that the grantee shall pay something
therefor is not to be construed as an equivalent or substitute for taxes
amounting to a contract of exemption from future taxation within the
impairment clause of the Federal Constitution.
The omission of the legislature for one year, or for a series of years, to tax
certain classes of property, otherwise taxable, does not destroy the
power of the State to subject them to taxation when it sees fit to do so.
Nothing in the Federal Constitution prevents a State from granting exemptions from taxation; and the reduction, upon equitable considerations, of payments made in the nature of taxes by certain corporations
on their franchises from the amount to which they are subjected by a

general law does not entitle every franchise owner to a similar reduction
and render the tax invalid because it denies the holders of some franchises the equal protection of the law or deprives them of their property
without due process of law.
The difference between surface street railroads and subsurface street railroads is sufficient to justify classification in the mode and extent of taxation, and a tax otherwise legal on surface street railroad franchises does,
not deprive the owners thereof of the equal protection of the laws because
subsurface street railroad franchises are not subjected to a similar tax.
The tax law of New York as amended May 26, 1899, c. 712, p. 1589, imposing taxes on certain public franchises is not repugnant, so far as the
franchises in this case are involved to the equal protection, due process,
or impairment of obligation clauses of the Federal Constitution and of
the Fourteenth Amendment thereto.
ON May 26, 1899, the legislature of New York passed an
act amending te.tax law of the State. Laws of New York,
1899, c. 712, p. 1589. The first section reads:
"SECTION 1. Subdivision three of section two of the tax

law is hereby amended to read as follows:
"8. The terms 'land,' 'real estate,' and 'real property,' as
used in this chapter, include the land itself above and under
water, all buildings and other articles and structures, substructures and superstructures, erected upon, under or above,
or affixed to the same; all wharves and piers, including the
value of the right to collect wharfage, cranage or dockage
thereon; all bridges, all telegraph lines, wires, poles and appurtenances; all supports and inclosures for electrical conductors and other appurtenances upon, above and under
ground; all surface, under ground or elevated railroads, including the value of all franchises, rights or permission to construct, maintain or operate the same in, under, above, on or
through, streets, highways, or public places; all railroad structures,
substructures and superstructures, tracks and the iron thereon;
branches, switches and othei.fixtures permitted or authorized
to be made, laid or placed-in, upon, above or under any public
or private road, street or ground; all mains, pipes and tanks
laid or placed in, upon, ,above or :under any public or private
street or place for conducting steam, heat, water,.oil, electricity

Statement of the Case.

or any property, substance or product capable of transportation or conveyance therein or that is protected thereby, including the value of all franchises, rights, authority or permission
to construct, maintain or operate, in, under, above, upon, or
through, any streets, highways, or public places, any mains, pipes,
tanks, conduits, or wires, with their appurtenances, for conducting water, steam, heat, light, power, gas, oil, or other substance,
or electricity for telegraphic, telephonic or other purposes; all
trees and underwood growing upon land, and all mines, minerals, quarries and fossils in aAd under the same, except mines
belonging to the State. A franchise, right, authority or permission specified in this subdivision shall for the purpose of
taxation be known as a 'special franchise.' A special franchise
shall be deemed to include the value of the tangible property of a
person, copartnership, association or corpordtion situated in,
upon, under or above any street, highway, public place or public
waters in connection with the special franchise. The tangible
property so included shall be taxed as a part of the special franchise. No property of a municipal corporation shall be subject
to a special franchise tax."
The portions in italics are the new matter introduced by
the amendment. Other sections were added to the tax law,
of which section 46 is as follows:
"SEC. 46. Deduction from special franchise tax for local purposes.-If, when the tax assessed on any special franchise is
due and payable under the provisions of law applicable to the
city, town, or village in which the tangible property is located,
it shall appear that the person, copartnership, association or
corporation affected has paid to such city, town or village for
its exclusive use within the next preceding year, under any
agreement therefor, or under any statute requiriig the same,
any sum based upon a percentage 6f gross earnings, or any
other income, or any license fee, or any sum of money on account of such special franchise, gr.anted to or possessed by
such person, copartnersh ip, association, or corporation, which
payment was in the nature of a tax, all amounts so paid for

the exclusive use of such city, town or village except money
paid or expended for paving or repairing of pavement of any
street, highway or public place, shall be deducted from any
tax based on the assessment made by the state board of tax
commissioners for city, town or village purposes, but not
otherwise; and the remainder shall be the tax on such special
franchise payable for city, town or village purposes. The
chamberlain or treasurer of a city, the treasurer of a village,
the supervisor of a town, or other officer to whom any sum is
paid for which a person, copartnership, association, or corporation is entitled to credit as provided in this section, shall, not
less than five nor more than twenty days before a tax on a
special franchise is payable, make and deliver to the collector
or receiver of taxes or other officer authorized to receive taxes
for such city, town or village, his certificate showing the several
amounts which have been paid during the year ending on the
day of the date of the certificate. On the receipt of such
certificate th6 collector, receiver, or other officer shall immediately credit on the tax roll to the person, copartnership,
association or corporation affected the amount stated in such
certificate, on any tax levied against, such person, copartnership, association or corporation on an assessment of a special
franchise for city, town or village purposes only, but no credit
shall be given on account of such payment or certificate in
any other year, nor for a greater sum than the amount of the
special franchise tax for city, town or village purposes, for
the current year; and he shall collect and receive the balance,
if any, of such tax as required by law."
Other sections provide the machinery 'for assessment. This,
assessment was to be made by the state board of tax commissioners, and one section authorized certiorari to review
their proceedings.
Under this law an assessment was made of the franchises
belonging to the plaintiff in error, a corporation created by the
consolidation of several corporations, having franchises for
the maintenance and operation of street railroads in the city

Statement of the Case.

of New York. A certiorari to review this assessment was
finally decided by the Court of Appeals of the State, which on
April 28, 1903, 174 N. Y. 417, sustained the assessment and
remanded the case to the special term of the Supreme Court,
by which court a final judgment was entered, June 22, 1903.
Thereupon this writ of error was sued out. Plaintiff in error
makes three assignments of error:
"I. Error in declining to hold that the act of the legislature
of the State of New York, approved May 26th, 1899 (ch. 712,
L. 1899), entitled 'An act to amend the tax law, in relation to
the taxation of public franchises as real property,' in so far as
it authorizes the assessment imposed by the state board of
tax commissioners on March 20, 1900, upon the franchises of
the [plaintiff in error], relator above named, deprives said
relator of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States.
"II. Error in declining to hold that said legislative enactment, in so far as it authorizes the said assessment, denies to
said relator the equal protection of the laws, in contravention
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States.
"III. Error in declining to hold that said legislative enactment, in so far as it authorizes the said assessment, impairs the
obligations of contracts, in contravention of section 10, Article 1, of the Constitution of the United States."
Prior to 1874 the legislature of New York made direct grants
of franchises, rights or privileges to use the streets of the city
of New York. In that year the following amendment to the
constitution was adopted. Constitution 1846, as amended,
art. 3, sec. 18:
"The legislature shall not pass a private or local bill in any
of the following cases: . .
"Granting to any corporation, association or individual the
right to lay down railroad tracks.- . .
"But no law shall authorize the construction or operation

of a street railroad except upon the condition that the consent
of the owners of one-half, in value of the property bounded on,
and the consent also of the local authorities having the control
of, that portion of, a street or highway upon which it is proposed
to construct or operate such railroad be first obtained, or in
case the consent of such property owners cannot be obtained,
the General Term of the Supreme Court, in the district in
which it is proposed'to be constructed, may, upon application,
appoint three commissioners, who shall determine, after a
hearing of all parties interested, whether such railroad ought
to be constructed or operated, and their determination, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of thet consent of the
property owners."
In 1884 an act was passed, Laws 1884, chap. 252, p. 309
giving to the local authorities power to grant, franchises for
street railroads. This act provided:
"Src. 7. The local authorities of any incorporated city or
village to whom application, under the provisions of this act,
may be made for consent to the construction, maintenance, use,
operation or extension of a street surface railroad upon any
street, road, avenue or highway may, at their option, provide
for the sale of, and sell at public auction the franchise, subject to all the provisions of this act, to so construct, maintain,
use, operate or extend such street surface railway.
"SEC. 8. Every corporation incorporated under, or constructing or operating a railroad constructed or extended
under the provisions of this act, within the cities of the State
having a population of two hundred and fifty thousand or
more, as aforesaid, shall for and (luring the first five years after
the commencement of the operation of any portion of its railroad, ainually, on the first day of November, pay into the
treasury of said respective cities in which its road is located
to the credit of the sinking fund thereof, three per cent of its
gross receipts for and (luring the year ending the next preceding thirtieth day of September, and after,'the expiration of

said five years, make a like annual phayment into the treasury
of said respective cities, for the credit of said sinking funds,
of five per cent instead f three per cent of said gross receipts;
provided, however, that every corjiorat.ion now existing and
operating a street surface railtoad which shall extend its tracks
or construct brancheg therefrom, ai.V oper ate such extensions
or branches under the provisions 0f this act, or the corporation
operating such branches or extensions, shall pay such percentagba as aforesaid only upon such portion of its gross receipts as shall bear the same prop'drtion to the whole value

in all cases be applied for in writing, Andl when granted shall
be upon the express condition that the provisions of this act
pertinent thereto shall be complied with, and shall be filed in

road is located.
In 1886 an act amending a prior; act of the same year was
passed, Laws' 1886, chap. 642, p. 919, which contained the
following 'terms:
"SEC. 1. The local authorities of any incorporated City or
village, to whoni application" maybe- nade for consent to the
construction, maintenance, use, operation or extension of a
street railroad or a railroad or railway for the transportation
of passengers, mi-ils or freight, over, upon, under or through
any of the streets, roads, . avenues, parks or public places in
such city or village, must provide, as a conlition of 101e said
consent to the use of Said street,'road, avenue, park or public
place, that the right, franchise and privilege of using the said
street, road, avenue, park or public place shall be sold at publaiest

or cirporation, with adquate seeurity as! hereinafter provi(le(I, for the fulfillment of said agreeenihihd f)r the comlmencement and completion of such read according to the

plan or plans, and on the route or routes fixed for its construction, within the time or times hereinafter designated and
prescribed therefor, but this agreement shall not release any
such road from the percentages required to be paid by chapter
two hundred and fifty-two of the laws of eighteen hundred
and eighty-four. The legislature expressly reserves the right
to regulate and reduce the rate of fare on such railroad or
railway.
"And in the event of the failure or refusal of the party or
corporation operating or using the railroad to be constructed
as aforesaid, to pay the rental or percentage of gross earnings
agreed upon, then, upon notice to the said party or corporation-of not less than sixty days-the said consent and right
to operate such railroad hay be declared forfeited, and the
same may be resold to the highest bidder in the manner above
provided."
The special acts passed before the amendment of 1874,
which are claimed to constitute contracts, the obligations of
which are impaired by this tai legislation, are found, first,'in
chap. 625 of the Laws of 1868, which granted to certain persons
the right to construct, maintain and operate and use a street
railroad, with a provision that "the said persons, or their
assigns, shall pay to the sinking fund commissioners of the
city of New York the sum of one thousand dollars per annum,
to be applied by them in the same manner as moneys received
on account of rentals and leases;" second, in chap. 19 of the
Laws of 1871, which, granting the privilege of occupying certain streets with street railroad tracks, provided that the company should "make compensation to the mayor, aldermen and
commonalty of said city of New York for the value of the rights
and privileges herein granted or authorized," and also prescribed the mode of ascertaining that compensation by three
commissioners, whose decision should be final and conclusive
as to the company and the mayor, aldermen and commonalty
of said city, adding "the amount so fixed and determined shall

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 9'

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

be paid to the commissioners of the sinking fund of said city,
by the said company, within thirty days after the same becomes payable, according to the decision aforesaid, and applied to the reduction of the debt of said city;" third, in
chap. 508 of the Laws of 1874, which granted the right to
"construct, operate, maintain and use railways" in certain
streets in the city of New York, and provided that "the said
persons, or their assigns, shall annually, on the first day of
November, pay into the treasury of the city of New York one
per cent. of the gross receipts of the road herein provided for,
the amount of which gross receipts shall be determined by the
sworn statement of the president and treasurer of said railway, but subject to the inspection of its books by the comptroller of the city of New York."
Subsequent to the law of 1884, above referred to, fifteen
other franchises now belonging to the relator were granted
by the common council of the city of New York. Most of them
provided for annual payment to the city of New York of either
a fixed amount or a fixed percentage, varying from two to
eight per cent of the gross earnings.
Mr. Elihu Root and Mr. William. D. Guthrie for plaintiffs
in error in this case and in Nos. 75 and 76:
The obligations of the several contracts under which plaintiffs in error acquired their local or special franchises are impaired by the statute ki so far as it seeks to subject such franchises to additional payments or taxation in excess of the
amounts agreed upon. See Heerwagen v. Crosstown St. Ry.
Co., 179 N. Y. 99, 104, as to effect of present statute.
The controlling inquiry in this case is whether the present
statute, in subjecting special franchises to ad valorem taxaion, does or does not exact further payyments than dhose
originally stipulated for in the contracts granting the several
franchises. While there are numerous separate and distinct
subjects or objects of corporate taxation, and any or all of
these may be selected by the legis.Lture for the purpose of

199 U. S.

levying and collecting taxes, and the taxation of one of these
subjects is-not the taxation of the other, and the exemption
of one or more does not involve the exemption of the others,
and while the assessment of two or more of these subjects at
the same time does not constitute duplicate or double taxation

the different methods are becoming so intermingled land complicated, that the courts are beginning to confess confusion
and the danger of error in their decisions. People ex rel. &c.
v. Knight, 174 N. Y. 475, 477. And pointing out these different
subjects see Farrington v. Tennessee, 95 U. S. 679, 686; Tennessee v. Whitworth, 117 U. S. 129 136; New Orleansv. Houston,
119 U. S.' 265, 277; Gibbons v. Mahon, 136 U. S. 549, 557;
Owensboro National Bank v. !Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 681.
The plaintiffs in error concede, for the purposes of these
cases, that they are subject to many forms of taxation on
property, franchise to .be a corporation, capital stock, dividends, or other objects not made the special subject of contract, and that the local or special franchises involved 'in the
present controversy constitute property, but they contend
that they have entered into valid contracts definitely fixing
the amount to be paid for and on their special franchises, and
that neither the State nor the city can increase these amounts

by way of taxes8or otherwise without impairing the obligations
of their contracts.
In the State of New York a city can not exact additional
compensation or payments by subsequent ordinance, beyond
what was reserved or stipulated for at the time, without violating the contract rights of the grantee of a franchise. People
v. Kerr, 27 N. Y. 188; Beckman v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 153
N. Y. 144, 152; People v. O'Brien, 111 N. Y. 1, 36; Mayor v.

Mobile, 49 Alabama, 362, 369; Los Angetes v. City Water Co.,

In all the statutes from 1884, franchises to use the streets

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 11

of a city could'be granted only upon express condition of an
annual payment of a percentage of gross receipts. The terms
of the ordiiances show thiat the 'city understood that it was
contracting fo6 the annual payment of a fixed amount or
percentage 'of gross receipts. Langdon v. Mayor, 93 N. Y.
129, 157.
Plaintiffs in error rely on the last two cases which are sought
to be distinguished by the statement that the additional taxes
then imposed were ot under a general law of the State, but
were "a mere effort on, the part of. the city to' impose the
obligation of paying an additional consideration for the rights
conferred on the grantee.
A's"ipulation in a coitract between a city and a railway
company, entered into pursuailt to the' exprkess provisions of
a statute and providing for the p aymen t of a fixed annual
sum or tax, necessarily implies that that fixed annual sum or
tax cannot be i'nreased by the State or the'city without impairing the 'toitract, and what is inpibdis as much a part of4a
contract or statute as wha is expressed. United States Bank
v. Babbit, 1 Black, 55, 61; Jolnes V. Kent", 80'N. Y. 585, 588.
The prior decisions have been iverruled in the cases at bar.
That much' is beyond dispute. When the highest court of a
State has adjudicated upon the validity and legal scope and
effect of a contract, particularly that of a municipality, and
subsequent contracts are made on the faith of, and enormous
sums are invested in reliance upon, such judicial interprotation, every principle of fairness and justice requires that the
contracts siall be construed and given, legal effect according
to the law as it was authoritatively declared to be at the time
the contracts were entered: into. When the numerous fran.chises in the cases at bar were sought by the railway companies,
when they were put up by the city at auction to the highest
bidder, when the legislature and city solicited capitalists to
embark and risk their funds, when the legislature and the city
exacted the most onerous terms and generally at public auction, all parties knew that the Court of Appeals of the Stts-

199 U. S.

had, in 1865, declared the law to be that such a grant of a
franchise to use the streets of a city constituted a contract,
and that, if the city stipulated in the grant for a fixed license
fee or tax, it could not increase that tax without impairing
the obligation of its contract. Olcott v. The Supervisors, 16
Wall. 678, 690; Gelpeke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 206;
Taylor v. Ypsilanti, 105 U. S. 60, 71; Douglass v. County of
Pike, 101 U. S. 677, 686; New Buffalo v. Iron Co., 105 U. S.

v. Harlem R. R., 197 U: S. 544.
It is a cardinal rule in drafting contracts and statutes not
to express what is implied in law. Expressio eorum quw tacite
insunt nihil operatur. Broom's Legal Maxims, 8th Am. ed.,
669; 2 Parsons on Contracts, 9thi ed., 670.
While contracts with States or municipalities are to be so
construed that an exemption from future taxation or regulation of rates is not to be implied unless in reason necessary to
give effect to the agreement, Ford v. Delta and Pine Land
Company, 164 U. S. 662, 666, if a contract specifically provides for a fixed tax or rate, it is implied in law that such
express stipulation is exclusive and covers tle present and
future, as fully as if the contract expressly so recited.
When the grant is upon valuable consideration, imposing
pecuniary and other obligations upon the grantee to which
he is bound by a valid contract, good sense and justice require that the grant should be construed according to the
rules of legal reasoning which govern all contracts and which
the experience and wisdom of generations have shown to be
just as between man and man. Charles River Bridge case,

Lessee v. Douglass, 3 Cranch, -1, 70; Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall.
203, 232; Langdon v. Mayor, 93 N. Y. 129, 148.
In each of these cases a grant was made by the State itself
or the city under express legislative authority providing for
payments in consideration of the franchise, right, or privilege
to use the streets of the city, ,"ndwe find the State seeking to
increase these stipulated amounts by the subsequent imposition of additional taxation. The mere fact that the original
, statute or contract does not call a fixed annual payment or
exaction a tax can make no difference. If the statute in the
present case had called the obligation a tax, it would not have
constituted it such, had its nature been otherwise. People
ex rel. W. U. T. Co. v. Dolan, 126 N. Y. 166, 175. Nor does
the fact that a specific sum or percentage is payable into the
sinking fund of a city change its nature as a tax. Pacific
Railroad Company v. Maguire, 20 Wall. 36, 44. According
to common understanding, an annual sum paid or exacted for
a franchise, right, or privilege, such as the right to use the
streets of a city or the highways of a town, is essentially a tax.
This is particularly true in the State of New York. Heerwagen
v. Crosstown St. Ry. Co., 179 N. Y. 99, 104. See also State
v. Ashbrook, 154 Missouri, 375, 385,. See definition of a "toll"

&c. Canal Co., 3 Abbott (N. Y. App.), 470, 477; Cooley's
Taxation,. 3d ed., 110; Cooley's Const. Lim., 7th ed., 713.
The mere fact that the words" compensation" and "rental"
were used by the legislature in any of the acts in question does
not in any way tend to change the nature of the payment.

The payment imposed upon corporations of a fixed annual
percentage on their gross or net receipts or earnings for the
privilege of exercising franchises, is essentially a tax. Maine

It is settled by the adjudications of this court that a grant
of power to a corporation to fix or collect tolls or rates does
not of itself ivmply any exclusion of the power of the legislature
thereafter to declare what shall be prima facie reasonable
compensation for the services to be rendered; but it has never
been even intimated by this court that, where the 'charter
of a corporation or the agreement between a corporation and
the State or a municipality has expressly provided for a fixed
rate of toll or charge, such rate could be varied by the legislature or municipality without impairing the obligation of the
contract. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S.

against the exaction of further payments to the State or to
the city, within the principles of the decisions cited. Nor
does the reservation of power to alter or amend the acts or
charters uphold the additional payments now sought to be
imposed. The legislature cannot in one breath insist that the
terms of its grant shall be performed by the grantee according
to the letter and in another breath say that it may under the

unequal taxation, and that its spirit and Its meaning alike
require that taxes imposed upon property of substantially the
same kind, in substantially the same situation, and used for
substantially the same purposes, shall be equal, so far as
equality may be practically attainable. A statute which attempts to classify those 'engaged in, 'the! same business and
owning similar property and to discriminate among them-unfairly or unnecessarilyis repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment..
While unavoidable inequality may 'not render the statute
unconstitutional, where substantial equality is readily attainable, and where it is plain that members of a class are unfairly
and unijustly discriminated against in a manner easy to obviate, the statute cannot be permitted t6' stand.
The law before' the court operates !Arbitrarily to deny plaintiffs -inerror 'the equal protection of the:laws and due process
in three separate and distinct aspects: It-adds to the obligations of the contracts while preserving all the burderis "of those
contracts. 'Itprovides: for the deduction of annual payments
covered by existing contracts from the amiount of tax levied,
'
agreed to pay for
by reason of which deduction those who
their franchises lump sums or annual amounts less than the
new tax are discriminated against. It discriminates against
them and subjects them to taxation, while their competitors
operating under the surfaces of many of the same streets are
to be exempted.
The act is nothing but an arbitrary exercise of power, and
comes within the condemnation of Stearns v. Minnesota, 179
U. S. 223. And see also Duluth &c. R. R.v. St. Louis County,
179 U. S. 302.
These cases present a mere arbitrary exercise of power.
Plaintiffs in error are held to the obligations of existing contracts, but the State and city seek to repudiate any reciprocal
obligation, and to subject them to a general law without releasing them from the obligations of their special contracts
under which they and others similarly situated have paid to

the city of New York during the fifteen years preceding the
passage of the tax law in question over $2,900,000.
When the legislature saysthat it will no longer treat special
franchises as particular property subject to classification by
itself, but will classify them with all other real estate and subject them to the same taxation, state and local, as all other
real estate, it. cannot provide that the owners of such special
franchises now to be so classified as real estate, may deduct
any rentals, annuities or instalments of purchase price
from
their tax, when all other owners of real estate pay taxe without any such, deductions. California Railroad,Tax cases, 13

If it should be argued that it is proper to deduct the amount
of these contract obligations from the tax laid upon the value
of the contract rights for rc- sons which would sustain deductions of mortgage indebtedness from assessments of real estate
for taxation, the answer is obvious. The present deductions
are not made from the 'assessments. Heerwagen v. Crosstown St. Ry. Co., 179 N. Y. 99, 106, and further, under the laws
of New York, such obligations are deductible from the personal
assessment. People ex rel. Cornell S. Co. v. Dederick, 161

ways in the city of New York: those granted without payments, those for which a lump sum was paid, and those for
which annual payments were agreed to be made, either of
a fixed sum or of a fixed percentage of gross receipts, or
both.
If these payments were in the nature of taxes-either commutation or annual-the increase would impair the obligations
of the several contracts. If, however, the agreements were
not to pay taxes but only rental or purchase price, how should
they be treated in any fair, just or equal system of .axation?
Should the annual payments be deducted from the taxes when
no allowance is made for lump sum payments, or should this
annual charge be capitalized, as an annuity, and the capital
amount deducted from the value in order to ascertain the
legal basis of assessment? See Heerwagen v. Crosstown St.
Ry. Co., 179 N. Y. 99, 106.
All unfairness and inequality could easily have been avoided
by providing, not that the grantee paying an annual rent or
charge should deduct that charge from his annual tax, but that
the annual charge should be taken into consideration in ascertaining the actual value of the franchises and the capitalized
value of the charge deducted, for, of course, in the case of a
man who owns an interest in property, which is conditioned
upon and subject to an annual charge, the true net value of
that interest can be arrived at.
In these cases the plaintiff- in error should be afforded the
fullest measure of protection, because they now find themselves, after the investment of their capital, not only already
taxed to an enormous amount in seven different forms, but
subjected to competition with grantees of the State and city,
who render the same service under some of the very streets
where plaintiffs in error operate their surface lines, and who
are exempted from taxation under the Rapid Transit Act
and the discrimination in favor of subservice roads denies the
owners of surface railway franchises the equal protection of
the laws.

Mr. Elihu Root, with whom Mr. Frank H. Platt was on the
brief, for plaintiffs in error in Nos. 77 and 78 argued simultaneously herewith:
A legislative enactment which requires or authorizes the
taxation of a certain class of property upon the basis of a sum
arbitrarily fixed by the assessing officers, without reference to
the value of the property, constitutes a deprivation of property
without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection
of the laws. People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 539, 544; Cooley's
Const. Lim., 7th ed., 705; 1 Cooley on Taxation, 3d ed., 419;
Santa Clara County v. So. Pac. Ry. Co., 18 Fed. Rep. 399.
While the determination of the method of apportioning a
tax is undoubtedly within the legislative power of the State,
uncontrolled by the Federal Constitution, Davidson v. New
Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 104; Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578,
582, the Federal Constitution requires that some method of
apportionment of the burdens of a tax shall be provided;
that the tax shall not be arbitrarily laid.

The constitutions of several States contain provisions requiring all taxation of property to be uniform and to be apportioned according to value. No such provision, however,
exists in the Constitution of New York. Such constitutional
provisions are merely declaratory of the fundamental principle

of due process of law in taxation. Thesame necessity of an
apportionment according to value exists independently of any
such provision. An apportionment by value is. the onlyescape
from the oppression and injustice of arbitrary exactions. San

There was: no evidence from which the value of the franchise could be ascertained. The allegation of the return that
there was investigation by the board's agents, who formed
opinions as to the value, if it could have any effect whatever,
would be equivalent to an allegation that the state tax commissioners had delegated their quasi-judicial powers to others,
and that these unnamed agents and not. the commissioners
themselves had determined the assessment. Such an assessment would be void. Lee v. Parry,4 Denio, 125; Doughty v.

There is no method by which the ' value of these franchises
.can be ascertained. Because there never was any real valuation of this franchise, never any basis established for that
apportionment of burdens which is essential to lawful taxation, the pretended tax complained of is a perfectly arbitrary

The failure of the special franchise tax law to indicate any
principle or method for ascertaining the value of the intangible
property included in the special franchise; the failure of the
state board to attempt any separate valuation of the intangible
property; and its failure to adopt or proceed upon any principle or method of valuing the totality of intangible and tangible
property together constituting the special franchise; and necessarily the substitution therefor; of speculation and guesswork, in place of judgment, in making such valuation, amounted
to such an absence of quasi-judicial action as to constitute the
taking of property without due process of law; and so far as the
statute contemplates such a procedure, the statute itself is unconstitutional, for the same reason. People v. San Francisco
Savings Union, 31 California, 132.
The multiple assessments of the property of this relator by

It follows from these authorities, that this court will not
interfere with the construction given by the state courts to the

words, decisions based on local laws not involving a Federal

These special franchises have all of the attributes of property. They are vendible and transferable. They cannot be
taken away, even under the power of eminent domain, without due compensation. They may be leased or mortgaged.
They survive the existence of the corporation upon. which they
are bestowed. They are the life and soul of the tangible property to which they appertain. They bestow an earning capacity
upon physical properties, which, without them, would corrode

and decay, and be utterly useless. While the tangible property employed for the utilization of the intangible franchise is
destructible; the latter is indestrutible. While the former requires renewal and reparation, the latter does not; and yet, the
two are inseparable, and together constitute a species of
property the aggregate of which in the Ijnited States, is valued
in the exchanges of the country at figures which almost paralyze
the imagination. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens'1. R.. Co., 184 U. S.

It has become axiomatic since the principle was first announced in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429, that
the authority of every State to tax all property, real and
personal, within its jurisdiction, is unquestionable. Western

Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, 190 U. S. 160, 163;

The State may from time to time bring within the purview
of its taxing power new subjects which had not been covered
by previous legislation; as, for example, mortgages owned by
citizens of other States on property within the State, Savings
& Loan Society v. Multnomah County, 169 U. S. 421; the right
of succession to the property of one dying, Magoun v. Illinois
Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283; debts:owing by a resident
debtor to a non-resident creditor, Blackstone v. Miller, 188
U. S. 189; the right given to a foreign corporation to carry on
business within the State, Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New

Hence, if, as has been shown, the franchises of a public service corporation are property, they may likewise become the
subject of taxation, especially when united with tangible
property designed to utilize such franchises. Henderson
Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 166 U. S. 150; State v. Anderson, 90
Wisconsin, 550; Detroit Citizens' Street Ry. Co. v. Common
Council, 125 Michigan, 673; State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S.
575.
The power to tax the relator's special franchises being thus
unquestionable, it becomes important to consider whether the
State of New York has debarred or precluded itself from imposing the tax created by the act under review, by any valid
contract between it and the relator, or those in privity with it.
The determination of this proposition will be facilitated by
the consideration of the three fundamental principles applicable
to the subject of exemption from taxation.
The power to tax being essential to the very existence of
the State, there can be no presumption that it has been either
abandoned or restricted, and whoever claims that it has been,
must show that the intent to grant immunity was conferred
in express and unambiguous terms, which will not be extended
by implication beyond their fair import. Exemption from
taxation will not be wrested from unwilling words. Cooley

Peters, 514; PhiladelphiaR. R. Co. v. Maryland, 10 How. 376;

U. S.666.
In the absence of express statutory authority the State alone
can grant exemption from taxation, and an attempt on the
part of a municipality to confer such immunity would be

Even where the State undertakes to restrict its power of
taxation, the rule applicable to the interpretation of public
grants applies, namely, that the instrument by which restriction is claimed to have been created, must be -,o strictly construed as to operate as a surrender of the sove- ign power no
further than is expressly declared by the terms of the grant,
the grantee taking nothing in that respect by inference.

U. S.,411, 412, in ascertaining whether there exists a conti 1,ct,
within the meaning of the constitutional provision now under
consideration.
The legislature did not intend to deal with the subject of
taxation, or of exemption from taxation. It cannot be said
that an intention to deal with those subjects existed. beyond

Applying these several authorities to the case under con-

sideration it is clear that no contract was created by the
several statutes and ordinances, on which the plaintiff in error
relied, which precluded the State from imposing a tax on the
-special franchises of the relator, the payments which were required of the grantees were not in the nature of taxation, in
any sense of the word. They were compensation for the rights
conferred, and nothing more. In some of the statutes, the
payment is referred to as in the nature of the payment of a
rental; in others as "compensption," and while the acts appearing as appendices, under which a large number of the
franchises are derived, do not denominate the annual payments required to be made, it is evident that the payment is
required as a consideration for the franchise acquired through
the action of the local authorities, or purchased at public
auction by the successful bidder. Under ch. 625, Laws of
1868, ch. 19, Laws of 1871, ch. 508, Laws of 1874, ch. 252,
Laws of 1884, ch. 65, Laws of 1886, it appears upon the face
of the statutes, that the payments which the relator and its
predecessors were required to make, were compensatory, by
way of consideration for the grant of a fee, or the rental of a
leasehold, and not by way of commutation for taxes:
Exemption from taxation is not referred to in a single one
of these numerous statutes. In every one of them the idea
is suggested that the privileges granted are deemed things of
value, and that in consequence the municipality was to be
entitled to some compensation for the thing granted. In
other words, railroad franchises were placed on the same
footing as ferry franchises and wharfage rights, which had
for many years been leased by the city of New York to individuals and corporations, and from which it had derived an
annual revenue by way of rental and which were nevertheless
taxed as property. Heerwagen v. Crosstown. Street Railway
Co., 179 N. Y. 99.
Assuming that the payments reserved by this legislation
in connection with the granting of franchises, constituted a
tax in the strict sense of the word, it is claimed that the. courts

will imply from that fact, a contract between the State and
the relator, that no tax in addition to that specified in the
legislatioA shall ever be imposed upon the corporation. In
other words, that beyond the tax imposed by the act of incorporation, the State has impliedly remitted all further obligation to pay taxes,
The right to impose the various forms of taxation now imposed on New York corporations, cumulatively, has been
recognized in numerous.. cases, including Farrington v. Tennessee, 95 U. S. 686, on which the relator relies.
That there was no intention to'exempt special franchises
from taxation and that the payments required to be made by
the State were merely by way of compensation for the right
conferred, becomes apparent when the history of chapter 252
of the Laws of 1884 is considered. See Davis v. The Mayor,
14 N. Y. 506; People v. Kerr, 27 N. Y. 188; Milhau v. Sharp,
27 N. Y. 611; New York state constiiution, as amended by
Article III, section 18; Public Papers of Governor Cleveland,
,1883, 1884, pp. 95-103, 108-117; Public Papers of Governor
Hill, 1886, pp. 95-101, in which the terms. of the various statutes and ordinances on which the plaintiff, in. error relied,
were analyzed and discussed.
The objection that the act under consideration violates the
"due 'process" clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution, is with6ut merit.
This court is not concerned with the correctness of the
valuation :6f the relator's special franchises, or of the soundness
of the rules of evidence, or of the opinions adopted by the tax
commissioners, the referee, or the several state -courts which
sat in review of the assessment. When the partiep to a controversy-and especially those whose property 'has' been assessed for purposes of taxation-have been fully heard in the
regular course of judicial proceedings, an erroneous decision
of a state court cannot be said, to deprive the unsuccessful
litigant of his property without due process of law. Sauvinet

The relator, instead of presenting facts which would guide
the state board of tax commissioners in fixing a valuation on
the special franchises to be assessed, stood mute on that subject, gave no testimony and presented no facts, but contented
themselves- with an effort to point out some flaw, if possible,
in th6 ratiocination by means of which the state board of tax
commissioners had reached a tentative valuation of the relators'
property. If such a procedure should receive judicial sanction,
insuperable difficulties would be placed in the way of taxing
officers and the 'collection of state revenues would become
well-nigh impossible. That a judicial or quasi-judicial officer
may not be subjected to such an extraordinary inquisition has
been conclusively shown in Fayerweather v. Ritch, 195 U. S.
276, 307, quoting from Packet Company v. Sickles, 5 Wall. 580.
In Coulter v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 196 U. S. 599,
610, the procedure of putting the members of the state board
of valuation and assessment upon the witness stand "to tesify
to the operations of their minds in doing the wrong entrusted
to them" was under the authority of Fayerweather v. Ritch,
supra, denounced as an "anomalous course."
Equally unfounded is the claim that this legislation deprives
the relator of the equal protectioti of the laws.

cided that such classification is not in contravention of the
Constitution. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S. 321;

Cook v. Marshall County, 196 U. S. 261: Coulter v. Louisville
& Nashville R. R. Co., 196 U. S. 608.
The plaintiff in error has attacked this legislation under two
principal heads.
That the legislature has arbitrarily exempted from taxation,
under section 35 of the Rapid Transit Law, competitors of the
plaintiff in error, who it is said are conducting exactly the same
business, by means of the subway.
This exemption provision referred to has no relevancy to a
special franchise, and even if it did, the railroad referred to
in the Rapid Transit Act is sui generis. It clearly differs
from every other railroad in the State. The company operating the subway does not own any special franchise in the
sense that the relator and other corporations own them. In
fact, the underground railroad is the property of the city of
New York. Chapter 4, Laws of 1891, as amended by chapter 752 of the Laws of 1894; chapter 519 of the Laws of 1895;
chapter 729 of the Laws of 1896; and chapter 616 of the Laws
of 1900; Sun Printing & Publishing Association v. Mayor
&c. of New York, 152 N. Y. 257.
It is claimed that the statute is unequal because the deductions permitted by section 46 of the act of 1899 discriminate in favor of corporations who make annual payments
either of a fixed sum, or of a fixed percentage of gross receipts,
or both, and against the owners of franchises who, because
they make no payments "in the nature of a tax" are allowed
no deductions.
As to this we urge that the relators are not aggrieved by
this alleged discrimination. They are the beneficiaries of sec'tion 46. It does not therefore lie with them to attack for
inequality a statute under which they derive a benefit.

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 35
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Irrespective of this answer, the statute creates no inequality,
since it places the owners of special franchises on an equal
footing. There is an equitable classification of the persons
or corporations who are subjected to the special franchise tax
similar to that which was recognized as valid in Magoun v.
Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283, and Orr v. Gillman, 183 U. S. 278.
Exact equality is a practical impossibility under any system of taxation and is not required. Under this statute a
single rule is applied, which operates with entire equality upon
all in like circumstances.
In Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232, the
right to allow deductions for indebtedness was decl ared to be
within the range of the State's power to regulate taxation.
If there were even a doubt as to the constitutionality of the
legislation now attacked, it should be determined in favor of
the validity of such legislation, since it affects the revenues of
a sovereign State and is designed to promote a just distribution of the burdens of taxation among its citizens. King v.
Mullins, 171 U. S. 436.
MR. JUSTICWE BR'hWER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The decision of the Court of Appeals settles that there is
nothing in the law or the proceedings in this case in conflict
with the constitution of that State. It is not contended by
the plaintiff in error that there is any constitutional objection
to the taxation of franchises. The right to subject them to a
share in the burden of supporting the government is conceded.
The main contention is that this tax legislation impairs the
obligation of contracts. It must be borne in mind that presumptively all property within the territorial limits of a State
is subject to its taxing power. Whoever insists that any particular property is not so subject has the burden of proof and
must make it entirely clear that, by contract or otherwise, the

property is beyond its reach. In Providence Bank v. Billings,
4 Pet. 514, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion
of the court, said (p. 561):
"That the taxing power is of vital importance; that it is
essential to the existence of government; are truths which it
cannot be necessary to reaffirm. They are acknowledged and
asserted by all. It would seem that the relinquishment of
such a power is never to be dssutned. We will not say that a
State may not relinquish it; that a consideration sufficiently
valuable to induce a partial release of it may not exist; but
as the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished, that community has a right to insist that its abandonment ought not to be presumed in a case in which the deliberate.
purpose of the State to abandon it does not appear."
In Vicksburg &c. R. R. Co. v. Dennis, 116 U. S. 665, Mr.
Justice Gray cited many authorities, quoting the different
phraseology in which by the several writers of the opinions the
same rule was announced. In Wells v. Savannah, 181 U. S.
531, the lhw was thus stated by Mr. Justice Peckham (p. 539) :o
"The payment of taxes on account of property otherwise
liable to taxation can only be avoided by clear proof of a valid
contract of exemption from such payment and the validity
of such contract presupposes a good consideration therefor.
If the property be in its nature taxable the contract exempting
it from taxation must, as we have said, be clearly proved. It
will not be inferred from facts which do not lead irresistibly
ahd necessarily to the existence of the contract. The facts
proved must show either a contract expressed in terms, or else
it must be implied from facts which leave no room for doubt
that such was the intention of the parties and that a valid
consideration existed for the contract. If there be afly doubt
on these matters, the. contract has not been proven and the
exemption does not exist."
In Chicago Theological Seminary v. Illinois, 188 U. S.662,
the same Justice declared (p. 672):
"The rule is that, in claims for exemption from taxation

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 37
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

under legislative authority, the exemption must be plainly
and unmistakably granted; it cannot exist by implication only;
a doubt is fatal to the claim."
See also Erie Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall. 492; Wilmington & Weldon R. R. Co. v. Alsbrook, 146 U. S. 279; Ford v.
Delta & Pine Land Co., 164 U. S. 662.
, This rule is akin to, if not part of, the broad proposition,
now universally accepted, that in grants from the public nothing passes by implication. As said by Mr. Chief Justice Taney,
in Charles River Bridge -v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 549:
"The inquiry, then, is, does the charter contain such a contract on the part of the State? Is there any such stipulation
to be found in that instrument? It must be admitted on all
hands that there is none; no words that even relate to another
bridge, or to the diminution of their tolls, or to the line of travel.
If a contract on that subject can be gathered from the charter,
it must be by implication, and cannot be found in the words
used. Can such an agreement be implied? The rule of construction before stated is an answer to the question. In
charters of this description, no rights are taken from the public
or given to the corporation, beyond those which the words of
the charter, by their natural and proper construction, purport
to convey. There are no words which import such a contract
as the plaintiffs in error contend for, and none can be implied."
Applying these well-established rules to the several contracts,
it will be perceived that there was no express relinquishment
of the right of taxation. The plaintiff in error must rely upon
some implication and not upon any direct stipulation. In
each contract there-was a grant of privileges, but the grant was
specifically of privileges in respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of a street railroad. These were all that
in terms were granted. As consideration for this grant the
grantees were to pay something, and such payment is nowhere
said to be in lieu of or as an equivalent or substitute for taxes.
All that can be extracted from the language used was a grant

of privileges and a payment therefor. Other words must be
written into the contract before there can be found any relinquishment of the power of taxation.
In the well-considered opinion of the Court of Appeals in
this case it was stated by Mr. Justice Vann:
"The franchises are grants which usually contain contracts,
executed by the municipality, but executory as to the owner.
They contain various conditions and stipulations to be observed
by the holders of the privilege, such as payment of'a license
fee, of a gross sum down, of a specific sum each year or a certain percentage of receipts, as a consideration, or 'in full satisfaction for. the use of the streets.' There is no provision that
the special franchise, or the property created by the grant,
shall be exempt from taxation.
"The con!itiorn upon which a franchise is granted is the
purchase price. of the grant, the payment of which in money,
or by an agreement to bear some burden, brought the property
into existence, which thereupon became taxable at the will of
the legislatu e, the same as land granted or leased by th6 State.
There is no implied covenant that property sold by the State
cannot be taxed by the State, which can even tax its own bonds,
given to' borrow money for its own use, unless they contain an
express stipulation of exemption. The rule of strict construction applies to state grants, and unless there is an express
stipulation not to tax, the right is reserved as an attribute of
sovereignty. Special franchises were not taxed until by the
act of 1899 amending the tax law they were added to the other
taxable property of the State. This is all that the statute does,
so far as the question now under consideration is concerned.
No part of the grant is changed, no stipulation altered, no payment increased and nothing exacted from the owner of the
franchise that is not exacted from the owners of property
generally. No blow is struck 'at the franchise, as such, for it
remains with every right conferred in full force, but, as it is
property, it is required to contribute its ratable share,-de-

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 39

Opinion of the Court.

pendent only upon value, toward the support of government."
It would not be doubted that if a grant was of specific tangible
property, like a tract of land, and the payment therefor was a
gross sum. no implication of an exemption from taxation would
arise. Whether the amount paid was large or small, greater
or less than the real value, if the payment was distinctly the
consideration of a grant, that which was granted would pass
into the bulk of private property, and, like all other such property, be subject to taxation. Nor would this result be altered
by the fact that the payment for the thing granted was to be
made annually instead of by a single sum in gross. If it was
real estate it would be equivalent to the conveyance of the
tract subject to ground rent, and the grantee taking the title
would hold it liable to taxation upon its value. If this be true
in reference to a grant of tangible property it is equally true
in respect to'a grant of a franchise, for a franchise, though intangible, is none the less property, and oftentimes property of
great value. Indeed, growing out of the conditions of modern
business, a large proportion of valuable property is to be found
in intangible things like franchises. We had occasion to review this subject in Adams Express Company v. Ohio, 166
U. S. 185, where we said (pp. 218, 219):
"In the complex civilization of to-day a large portion of the
iyealth of a, community consists in intangible property, and
there is notihing in the nature of things or in the limitations of
the Federal Constitution which restrains a State from taxing
at its val value such intangible property. . . . It matters
not in what this intangible property consists-whether privileges, corporate franchises, contracts or obligations. It is
enough that it is property which, though intangible, exists,
which has value, produces income and passes current in the
markets of the world. To ignore this intangible property, or
to hold that it is not subject to taxation at its accepted value,
is to eliminate from the reach of the taxing power a large portion of the wealth of the country."

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

In State RailroadTax cases, 92 U. S. 575, 603, is this language
by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court:
'That the franchise, capital stock, business, and profits of
all corporations are liable to taxation in the place where they
do business, and by the State which creates them, admits of
no dispute at this day. 'Nothing can be more certain in legal
decisions,' says this court in Society fr Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall.
607, 'than that the privileges and franchises of a private corporation, and all trades and avocations by which the citizens
acquire a livelihood, may be taxed by a State for the support
of a state government.' State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall.
232; State Tax on GrosM Receipts, 15 Wall. 284."
It is urged that when the public grants a privilege on condition of the payment of an annual sum the contract implies
that the public shall exact no larger amount for that privilege,
that to impose a tax is simply increasing the price which the
grantee is called upon to pay for the privilege, and Gordon v.
Appeal Tax Court, 3 How. 133, is relied upon as authority.
It is true, in the opinion of the court, announced by Mr. Justice Wayne, is this language (p. 145):
"Such a contract is a limitation upon the taxing power of
the legislature making it, and upon sncceeding legislatures, to
impose any further tax' upon the franchise. But why, when
bought; as it becomes property, may it not be taxed as land is
taxed which has been bought from the State?. was repeatedly
asked in the course of the argument. The reason is, that every
one buys land, subject in his own apprehension to the great law.
of necessity, that we must contribute from it and all of our
property something to maintain the State. But a franchise
for banking, when bought, the price is paid for the use of the
privilege Whilst its lasts, and any tax upon it would substantially be an addition to the price."
But there was in that case an express exemption from taxation in these words:
"'And be it enacted, that, upon any of the aforesaid banks
accepting of and complying with the terms and conditions of

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK 41
199 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

this act, the faith of the State is hereby pledged not to impose
any further tax or burden upon them during the continuance
of their charters under this act."
There being thus an express stipulation on the part of a
State not to impose any further tax or burden, the question
decided was really the extent of the exemption, and it was held
to apply not merely to-the franchise but to the property of the,
bank. The statements of Mr. Justice Wayne were only by
way of argument to support the conclusion that the exemption
went beyond the franchise alone. Furthermore, that case has
been repeatedly qualified and limited by subsequent decisions.
In New Orleans City Railroad Company v. New Orleans, 143
U. S. 192, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, said (p. 195):
"Exemption from taxation is never to be presumed. The
legislatdre itself cannot be held to have intended to surrender
the txing power, unless its intention to do so has been declared in clear and unmistakable words. Vicksburg &c. Railroad v. Dennis, 116 U. S. 665, 668, and cases cited. Assuming,
without deciding, that the city of New Orleans was authorized
to exempt the New Orleans City- Railroad Company from
taxation under general laws of the State, the contract between
them affords no evidence of an intention to (1o so. The franchise to build and run a street railway was as much subject
to taxation as any other property.
"In Gordon v. Appeal Tax Court, 3 How. 133, upon which
the plaintiff in error much relied, the only point decided was
that an act of the legislature, continuing the charter of a bank,
upon condition that the corporation should pay certain sums
annually for public purposes, and declaring that, upon its
accepting and complying with the provisions of the act, the
faith of the State was pledged not to impose any further tax
or burden upon the corporation during the continuance of the
charter, exempted the stockholders from taxation on their
stock; and so much of the opinion as might, taken by itself,
seem to support this writ of error, has been often explained or
disapproved. State Bank v. Knoop, 16 How. 369, 386, 401,

"'The case at bar cannot be distinguished from that of
Memphis Gaslight Co. v. Shelby County, in which this court
upheld, a license tax upon a corporation which had acquired
by its charter the privilege of erecting gas works and making
and selling gas for fifty years; and, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said: 'The argument of counsel is that if no express contract against taxation can be found here, it must be implied,
because to permit the State to tax this company by a license
tax for the privilege granted by its charter is to destroy that
privilege. But the answer- is that the company took their
charter subject to the same right of taxation in the State that
applies to all other privileges and to all other property. If
they wished or in:ended to have an exemption of any kind from
taxation, or felt that it was necessary to the profitable working
of their business, they should have required a provision, to
that effect in their charter. The Constitution of the United
States does not profess in all cases to protect property from
unjust and oppressive taxation by the States. That is left
to the state constitutions and state laws.' 109 U. S. 398,
400."
Murray v. Charleston,96 U. S.432, is not in point. The city
of Charleston, having issued bonds, subsequently passed an
ordinance assessing a tax upon all real and personal property in
the city, and directed the treasurei to tetain out of the interest
due on those bonds the amount of the tax. Murray was a resident of Germany and resisted the reduction of interest, and it
was held that the city could not by way of a tax reduce the
amount of the interest which ft had promised to pay to this
non-resident holder, the court saying in its opinion (p. 440):
"A non-resident creditor cannot be said to be, in virtue of a
debt due to him, a holder of property within the city; and the
city council was authorized to make assessments- only upon

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 43

Opinion of the Court.

the inhabitants of Charleston, or those holding taxable property within the same."
Chicago v. Sheldon, 9 Wall. 50, is also not in point. An
ordinance was passed by the city council of Chicago prescribing
the amount of work which a street railway company must do
in the grading, paving, etc., of the streets on which its railway
was authorized to be constructed. The company, having accepted and complied with the terms of this ordinance, the city
attempted by assessments for special improvements to compel
the railway company to pay for further work of the nature
required by the original ordinance, and it was held that the
obligations assumed by the railway company in respect to
street improvements, as provided by the ordinance, could not
be increased by special assessments for further improvements.
But this involved no question of liability to general taxation,
and only held void the effort of the city under the guise of
special assessments to increase the obligations specifically
assumed by the railway company under the original ordinance.
In New Jersey v. Yard, 95 U. S. 104, there was a contract
that a certain tax should "be in lieu and satisfaction of all other
taxation or imposition whatsoever, by or under the authority
of this State, or any law thereof," and the decision simply upheld that exemption specifically contracted for.
It is further contended that there has been a recognition
and practical construction in respect to the grants of these
franchises, and on these grounds: First, no attempt was ever
made to legislate in respect to their taxation until 1899, although some of them had been in existence for many years;
second, Governor Cleveland, in one of his messages called the
amount required to be paid by the contract a "tax," and
Governor Roosevelt also spoke of existing "taxes;" third, section 46 of the legislation authorizing the tax upon these franchises provided that "any sum based upon a percentage of
gross earnings, or any other income, or any license fee, or any
sum of money on account of such special franchise, granted to
or possessed by such person, copartnership, association, or

corporation, which payment was in the nature of a tax, all
amounts so paid for the exclusive use of such city, town or
village, except money paid or expended for paving or repairing
of pavement of any street, highway or public place, shall be
deducted from any tax based on the assessment madw by the
state board of tax commissioners 'for city, town or village purposes, but not otherwise; and the remainder shall be the tax
on such special franchise payable for city, town or village
purposes;" fourth, the Court of Appeals of New York in Heerwagen v. Crosstown Street Railway Company, 179 N. Y. 99,
104, said:
"In the first place, both in statutes and in judicial decisions
the term 'tax' is frequently used in a much more comprehensive sense than that which we have stated to be its accurate
meaning. It is not used so broadly as to include the revenue
from private property which the State or one of its political
divisions may hold for emolument the same as other owners;
but it certainly is used to comprehend exactions for the privilege of exercising franchise rights, which latter are often, especially in the case of foreign corporations, merely the consideration received for privileges which the State is at liberty to
grant or to withhold at pleasure."
We are not disposed to undervalue the force of these suggestions, but it would be giving them undue significance to hold
that they are potent to displace the power of the State to subject to the burdens of taxation property within its limits. The
word "tax" is not infrequently used in a general sense as denoting a burden or charge, and not in the strict legal sense of
the charge or burden imposed by the State for the purposes of
revenue for its support. Undoubtedly the payment for the
franchise of an annual sum was a burden, and in that sense it
might not unnaturally have been spoken of as a tax. Being
recognized as a burden it may also well be that when the
franchise itself was of comparatively little value ithe legislature
did not see fit to subject it to, the burdens of ordinary taxation.
But the omission of one legislature or a dozen legislatures does

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 45
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

not destroy the power cf the State. The language quoted from
section .46 indicates the desire of the legislature to deal equitably
with the corporations holding ,these franchises. Surely the
manifestation of this desire cannot be construed into a repudiation of power. These annual charges are not called taxes, but
are spoken of as in the nature of a tax, and the legislature
recognizing the equitable force of the claim based thereon provided that the corporation be given credit for sums thus payable. Ii this connection it is well to recall that in section 1
of the act of 1886, supra, these ,annual charges are called
"rental *or percentage of gross earnings."
The quotation from the Court of Appeals, must be interprtd
in the light of the question presented. That was whether the
,,appellee company was entitled to avail itself of the provision
of sec. 46 just quoted, it having been required by its charter
to pay a certain percentage of its gross receipts. , It was held
that it was so entitled, and the argument was to show that the
words "in the nature of a tax" were used in a broad and cornprehensive sense to include a payment made on account of the
privilege granted., No question was made or considered as :to
the liability of the company to the tax on its franchise. Its
only claim was to the deduction on account of the percentage
of its receipts already'paid. The court, in addition to the
laliguage quoted, said (p. 106):
"The statute in question was enacted at a speeial session
of the legislature convened by the Governor for that purpose.
In his message to the legislature he recommended that 'it
should be provided that from the sum assessed by, the state
authorities as the tax which a corporation mtnst pay bfqause
of its local franchise, there shall be deducted thl ap Qunt:a.lready
annually paid by it to the locality for such franchise. In no
other way is it possible to tax these corporations with uniformity and equity.' It may be that this view is erronequs,,and
that the more accurate and equitable- way would be to: determine the value of the franchise not as free and clear~but. a3
burdened by the charges to which it might be subject. Never-

theless it is plain that this view was accepted by the legislature,
for under the scheme provided by the present statute the
franchise is to be assessed as real estate; that is to say, not subject to diminution for charges thereon, and the allowance for
such charges is made only by deducting them from the tax."
We are of opinion that no contract right of the relator was
impaired by the legislation in question.
It is further insisted that the special franchise tax law denies
the relator the equal protection of the laws and due process in
three separate and distinct aspects, "namely, (1) in that it
adds to the obligations of their various contracts while preserving all the burdens of those contracts; (2) in that it provides for
the deduction of annual payments covered by existing contracts from the amount of tax levied, by reason of which deduction those who agreed to pay for their franchises lump sums or
annual amounts less than the new tax are discriminated against;
and (3) in that it discriminates against them and subjects them
to taxation, while their competitors operating under, the surfaces of many of the same streets are to be exempted."
The first specification is answered by the conclusion that we
have reached in respect to the claim of an impairment of contract obligations, for if there was no such impairment the fact
that the companies have escaped the burden for these many
years is their good fortune, and in no manner discharges them
from the ordinary burdens of taxation which the present law
imposes.
With respect to the second, it may be observed that the lump
sum is so obviously a payment for the franchise that it cannot
be considered in any just sense as possessing the nature of a
tax. It is not even rental. It is like money paid for a tract
of l.nd, part of the purchase price. It does not, like a percentage of the gross receipts, vary with the changes of business,
has no 'resemblance to a continuing discharge of the obligation
which property is under for contribution to the support ,of the
Government. Further, this whole matter of allowing a reduction on account of that which is spoken of as "in the nature of

METROPOLITAN STREET RY. CO. v. NEW YORK. 47
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

a tax" is a matter of grace on the part of the legislature. The
franchises granted were, as we have held, subject to taxation,
and the fact that upon equitable considerations the State has
consented that a certain reduction shall, in some cases be
made, does not entitle every holder of a franchise to a like reduction. It is akin to an exemption, and there is nothing in
the Federal Constitution to prevent a State from granting
exemption from taxation. Bell's Gap Railroad Company v.
Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232.
With regard to the third contention, it may be said that
there is a difference between surface and subsurface street
railroads sufficient to justify a diversity in the mode and extent of taxation. In Savannah &c. Railway Company v.
Savannah, 198 U. S. 392, just decided, taxation of a street railroad was challenged on the ground that a steam railroad which
ran into the city and along its streets, and there did some of
the same kind of work as the ordinary street railroad, was not
subject to the same tax, and, referring to this contention, is
this declaration by Mr. Justice Holmes: "The difference between the two railroads is obvious and warrants the diversity
in the mode of taxation." Further, the condition of the title
to the only subsurface road in the city of New York clearly
puts it in a class by itself.
These are all the questions we deem it important to consider. We find no error in the decision of the Supreme Court
of New York, and it is

Affirmed.
