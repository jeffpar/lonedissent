GLEASON v. WHITE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
No. 188.

Argued and Submitted March 16, 17, 1905.-Decided May 29, 1905.

Two official surveys of a tract of land bordering on navigable waters were,
with an interval of thirty years, duly made, approved and filed in the
Land Department at Washington. By the earlier survey a fractional
section was divided into two lots, by the later into seven. These divisions
conflicted. After the later survey two patents were issued, one using
the description in the first and conveying the entire fractional section,
the other following the second survey and conveying only part of the
section. As to a portion of the ground these patents conflicted. In an
action at law in the state court the second patent prevailed as to the
tract in conflict.
Held that, in the absence of findings of fact (there being evidence tending
to show that the first patentee took with full knowledge of the two surveys,
the later one having been made partly at least at his request, and it also
appearing that by the decision he received the full number of acres to
which he was by the earlier survey entitled and for which he paid), the
judgment in favor of the second patentee for the part in conflict ought
not to be disturbed.

IN 1845 fractional township 53 south, range 42 west, in
Dade County, Florida, was surveyed and a plat thereof was
approved and filed in the office of the surveyor general in
Florida, and also in the office of the Land Department of
Washington. By this survey fractional section 19 was divided into two lots, numbered 1 and 2, containing 164.84
acres. In 1875 a resurvey was made of the township, plats of
which were also duly approved and filed in the office of the
