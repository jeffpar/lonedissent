been mistaken as to the land that he was acquiring from the
Government, for he must have lived on it five years in order
to have perfected his homestead. He could not have been
ignorant of the large tract lying east of what was described in
the plat of 1845 as "lot 1." The official plat at the time of the
patent was the plat of the survey of 1875. He was chargeable
as matter of law with notice of that plat. More than that, as
the survey was at his instance, it is a reasonable assumption
that in fact he knew what the lines of that survey and plat
were. Under those circumstances full justice is done if a
patent title to lands outside his lines as shown by the plat of
1845, is sustained, for he still is protected in the tract bounded
by those lines and amounting to 164.84 acres. To give him
twice that amount of land would be enabling him to profit
by a mistake of the Government-a mistake of which he was
cognizant. Under those circumstances we are of opinion that
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida must be and
it is
Affirmed.

HYDE v. SHINE.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 406.

Argued February 21, 23, 1905.-Decided May 29, 19.

Section 1014, Rev. Stat., authorizes a removal from a judicial district in
a State to the District of Columbia. Benson v. Henkel, 198 U. S. 1.
Where the indictment charges that a conspiracy was entered into in a District, the trial court of that District has jurisdiction of the offense
although the overt acts carrying out the conspiracy were committed in
another jurisdiction.
While this court does not approve the practice of indicting citizens in courts
far distant from their residence if they can be tried in courts of their own
jurisdiction, § 1014, Rev. Stat., contains no discrimination based upon

HYDE v. SHINE.
199 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

distance and requires the commitment to be made for trial before the
court having cognizance of the offense, and in the absence of an exception
in the statute the court cannot create one.
Section 23, ch. 35, Comp. Stat. District of Columbia, giving the Criminal
Court of the District jurisdiction of all crimes and misdemeanors committed in the District, not lawfully triable in any other court, has reference only to other courts within the District, and was not intended to
change the law with respect to the general jurisdiction of courts having
jurisdiction of the same offense.
On the facts in this case the indictment which charges a completed conspiracy to defraud the United States by means of obtaining state lands
through sales to fictitious persons and then exchanging them for lands
of the United States under the forest reserve acts, held sufficient notwithstanding that the State received full compensation for the lands.
The States and the United States have power to punish violations of a statute enacted as a part of the public policy even though theyt may not have
suffered any pecuniary damage from such violations.
A patent to a fictitious person is in legal effect no more than a declaration
that the Government thereby conveys the property to no one, and in
suQh a case the doctrine that a subsequent bona fide purchaser is protected
does not apply.
Whether the act charged is or is not a crime is one which the- trial court is
competent to decide, and, under the circumstances of this case, this court
will not review the validity of the indictment upon habeas corpus.
While a Federal court on habeas corpus may order the petitioner's discharge
if there is an entire lack of evidence to support the accusation, where
a prima facie case is made by the indictment, and the commissioner receives evidence on petitioner's behalf, it is for him to determine whether
probable cause existed and the court will not weigh the evidence on
habeas corpus.
The requirement in § 1014, Rev. Stat., that proceedings for removal shall
be agreeable to the usual state procedure, applies to the proceedings for
arrest and examination of the accused before the commissioner, but not
to subsequent independent proceedings before the Circuit Court on
habeas corpus.
While the Circuit Court has power to issue a writ of certiorari auxiliary to
the writ of habeas corpus it is wholly discretionary with it, and its refusal
to do so cannot be assigned as error.

THIS is an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court deny-

ing the appellant's application for writs of habeas corpus and
certiorari, and dismissing his petition therefor.
The proceedings which culminated in the arrest and remanding of the appellant originated in an indictment found in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against the appellant

and John A. Benson, Henry P. Dimond, and Joost H. Schneider,
charging them with a conspiracy, under Rev. Stat. sec. 5440,
"to defraud the United States out of the possession and use
of and the title to, divers large tracts of the public lands of the
United States." All of the defendants except Schneider are
residents of San Francisco, California. Upon a complaint
made, based upon such indictment, before a United States
Commissioner for the Northern District of California, Hyde
was arrested under Rev. Stat. sec. 1014, taken before a Commissioner and held to bail to a~swer the indictment in the sum
of $50,000, and in default thereof was committed to the custody
of the defendant Shine to await the order of the District Judge
for his removal to the District of Columbia, or until he should
be discharged by, due course of law. Upon such order of removal being issued, United States v. Hyde, 132 Fed. Rep. 545,
appellant presented his petition to the Circuit Court for the
Northern District of California, praying for .writs of habeas
corpus and certiorari, and for his discharge from imprisonment, which were denied, and this appeal taken.

appellant should be tried in California where he was apprehended. United States v. Bird, 1 Spr. 299; Dist. Col. Code,

else § 1014 does not authorize his removal to the District of Columbia. The same rule applies to cases of extradition. In

Argument for Appellant.

199 U. S.

If an overt act was necessary to complete the crime the
courts in the District of Columbia would not have jurisdiction
as the statute of limitation runs from the commission of the
first overt act which was over three years before the indictment. United States v. Owen, 32 Fed. Rep. 134; United States
v. McCord, 72 Fed. Rep. 159; § 1044, Rev. Stat.; United States
v. Hirsch, 100 U. S. 33. See also Bannon 4. United States, 156
U. S. 464; United States v. Newton, 52 Fed. Rep. 275; United
States v. Watson, 17 Fed. Rep. 145; United States v. Sacia, 2
Fed. Rep. 754. United States v. Green, 115 Fed. Rep. 343,
distinguished.
The venue of the alleged conspiracy is improperly laid in
the District of Columbia. United States v. Rindskopf,' 6 Biss.
259; act of March 2, 1874, 14 Stat. 471; § 731, Rev. Stat.;
United States v. Britton, 108 U. S. 199; Pettibone v. United
States, 148 U. S. 202; Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539;
Berkowitz v. United States, 93 Fed. Rep. 452; see also Commonwealth v. Mactoon, 101 .Massachusetts, 1; Sha/tsbury v.
Graham, Skinner, 32; Smith v. Cranshaw, 2 Rolle, 258; Regina v. Best, 1 Salk. 174; King v. Brisac, 4 East Rep. 164.
The courts of the District of Columbia have no jurisdiction
of a bare conspiracy committed in California, not to commit
a crime, -but where the conspiracy itself is the only crime
charged. The venue must be not where the conspiracy was
but where the result was put in execution.
As the indictment was found in a court not having jurisdiction of the offense it cannot constitute the basis for removal
proceedings. The alleged act of conspiracy was committed,
if at all, prior to the going into effect of the District Code. See
cases, supra, and as to a law not having a retrospective operation
see Dodge v. Bank, 109, Fed. Rep. 726; Dewart v. Purdy, 29
Pa. St. 1.13; 31 Stat. 5, 1189, 1199, 1436. The indictment is
void for not concluding "'against the peace and Government
of the United States" as required by statute. 2 Stat. 115.
It is the duty of the court to look into the indictment, and
if it charges no offense against the United States, or is so es-

does §731 apply to the District of Columbia.
The indictment charges no offense against the United States.
A patent granting public lands, although procured by irregularities or fraud, can not be questioned collaterally, but
only by direct proceedings on behalf of. the Government to
avoid the patent. The patents of the State surrendered to
the United States conveyed a legal title which, until attacked
directly by the State of California, was good, and so long as
the patents remained unassailed the State had no equitable title
in the land and the United States got a good title to the land
surrendered and was not defrauded. O'Connor v. Trasher, 56

The Commissioner and the district judge having jurisdiction

was committed is for the trial court to decide. Ex parte
Siebold, 100 U. S. 371.
The acts charged are immoral and such as might have been
included in § 5440, Rev. Stat., and it is not clear and manifest
that the indictment does not state an offense against the
United States.
As to the policy of United States in regard to forest reserves
see § 24, act of March 3, 1901, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103; act of June 4,
1897, 3() Stat. 11, 36; act of June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 588, 614.
The purposes of this legislation were to preserve the remaining forests on the public lands and to improve and protect the
forests within the reservations, for the purpose of securing
conditions favorable to continuous water flows, and to a permanent supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens
of the United States. Manifestly, the Government would be
greatly aided in accomplishing these objects by securing exclusive ownership and control of all lands within the reservations. To this end the act of June 4, 1897, was passed. It
contains an offer by the Government to exchange any of its
lands that are vacant and open to settlement for a like quantity
of lands within a forest reservation, covered either by an
unperfected bona fide claim or by a patent. In the administration of the act the Land Department has construed the words
" covered by a patent " to embrace any tract of land as to which
the absolute fee simple title has passed out of the United States

by any means which is the full legal equivalent of a patent.

Under acts of Congress making grants of school lands to the
various States the title to such lands (usually sections 16 and
36, as in the States of California and Oregon), passes by the
grant, upon identification of the lands by survey, and therefore
patents of the United States are not necessary to convey such
title. Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173; Beecher v. Wetherby, 95
U. S.517, 524, 525; Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold Mining Company, 93 U. S. 634; McCreary v. Haskell, 119 U. S. 327, 331.
This principle has been followed by the Land Department in
the administration of the act of June 4, 1897. It has been
uniformly held that surveyed school lands within forest reserves are embraced within the meaning of the words "covered
by a patent" as used in said act. See statutes of California
providing for disposal of school lands, §§ 3495, 3500, Political
Code, and as to Oregon see §3617, 2 Hill's Ann. Laws, 1887.
In California an applicant to purchase state lands must set
out in his affidavit all the facts required by the statute to be
stated therein, and as to all such facts the affidavit must be
true or the proceedings will be invalid. Taylor v. Weston, 77
California, 534, 535; Harbin v. Burghart, 76 California, 119;

The facts narrated constitute an offense against the United
States under § 5440, because the United States would receive
absolutely nothing of value, and would be induced to part withapparent record titles to its public lands, under which appar-,

indefinite period of time. Land patents issued to fictitious
persons convey no title and are absolutely void. Moffat v.
United States, 112 U. S. 24, 31.
By the consummation of the scheme, the Government would
be defrauded out of the possession and use of lands covered
by such apparent record titles, obtained by deception and
fraud, for an indefinite period of time, to wit, until the fictitious
character of its own patentees would be discovered. Until
such discovery, those claiming under such apparent record
titles would hold the possession of lands really belonging to
the United States, and would appropriate and use the same,
and the timber thereon, for their own benefit, and to the injury,
detriment, and pecuniary loss of the Government. It is just
as much an offense under §5440 to defraud the United States
out of the possessionand use of its public lands as it is to
defrauq it out of the title to such lands. As to each and all of
the elements or parts of the alleged conspiracy, it is charged
in the indictment that the object and purpose thereof were to
defraud the United States out of the possession and use of its
public lands as well as out of the title thereto. United States
v. Thompson, 29 Fed. Rep. 86.
The Government holds its public-lands as a part of its trust;
that is, as trustee for the people of the United States, United
States v. Beebe, 127 U. S. 338, 342; Knight v. U. S. Land Association, 142 U. S. 161, 177; McDaid v. Oklahoma, 150 U. S.
209, 215; and, by the consummation of the scheme under con-

siderafion, the people would be defrauded out of their right
under the public land laws to secure title to the particular
lands covered by such apparent record titles until the discovery of the fictitious character of the pa tentees.

Procuring patents from the United States for its public
lands by fraudulent representations to the legally constituted
authorities, or by concealing from such authorities facts which
if known would have defeated the issuance of the patents, is a
fraud upon the United States. United Stays v. Beebe, 127

While defendant's acts in fraudulently acquiring school
lands from the States of California and Oregon, alone considered, or if disconnected from any purpose on the part of
the defendants to exchange the lands so acquired, for public
lands of the United States, would not constitute an offense
against the United States, those acts constitute one of the links
in the chain of which the conspiracy to defraud the United
States is composed.
By tendering to the United States, in exchange for its public
lands, the titles obtained by fraudulent practices from the
States of California and Oregon for the sole purpose. of making
such exchange, the defendant has been guilty of an attempt
to defraud the United States. Moreover, the same act or
series of acts may constitute an offense equally against the
United States and against the State, and subject the guilty
party to punishment under the law of each- government.

The indictment charges that the object of the conspiracy
was to defraud the United States out of the possession and use
of its public lands as well as out of the title to such lands.
One who accepts the Government's offer to exchange lands under the act of 1897 becomes vested with the equitable title to
the public lands which he selects, as soon as he has complied
with all the requirements necessary to entitle him to a United
States patent therefor and has secured the approval of. his
selection by the Land Department. Kern Oil Co. v. Clarke,

The rule of bona fide purchaser is the creation of courts of
equity, and is enforced solely for the purpose of protecting that
one of tw(c innocent parties who is least to blame when one of
them must suffer loss. It is never enforced for the protection
of a guilty person. The rule was not adopted for the protection of swindlers. Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 50,6.
A further element of the conspiracy as charged in the indictment is bribery of public officials.
The pther counts in the indictment are in the same form as
the first, except that they refer to the first for a general description of the several conspiracies. Each count charges a
separate conspiracy, and the defendants might be found guilty
on one orm more counts and not guiltyas to other counts. The

Bew v. United States, 144-U. S. 47, 59.
MR. JUSTICE BRoWN, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The petitioner assigns as error1. That Rev. Stat. sec. 1014 does not authorize a removal
from a judicial district in a State to the District of Columbia;
2. That the Supreme Court of the District 61 Columbia has
no jurisdiction over the alleged bffense charged in the.indictment;
3. That the indictment charges no offense against the United
States;
4. That the evidence introduced before the Commissioner
proved that there was no probable cause for believing him
guilty of the offense, and that the writ of certiorari should
have been issued to bring the record before the court, and upon.
its inspection the appellant should have been discharged.
1. The first assignment is practically disposed of by the
recent case of Benson v. Henkel, 198 U. S.1, in which one of
the co-defendants of the petitioner in this case, who had been
arrested in Brooklyn, was held to be properly removed to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

District of Columbia under Rev. Stat. sec. 1014. No additional considerations being presented, that case must be treated
as controlling.
2. The second assignment, that the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia had no jurisdiction of the alleged offense,
is based upon the proposition that the conspiracy, if any existed, was entered into either in the Northern District of California or the District of Oregon, and that nothing but overt
acts in pursuance of the conspiracy were done in the District
of Columbia. Granting that the gravamen of the offense is
the conspiracy, and that at common law it was neither necessary to aver nor prove an overt act, Rex v. Gill, 2 B. & Ald.
204; Bannon v. United States, 156 U. S. 464, 468, an overt act
is necessary under Rev. Stat. see. 5440 to complete the offense.
The larfguage of the section is, "If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States,
or to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the
object of the conspiracy, all the parties to such conspiracy
shall be liable," etc.
It was aptly said by Mr. Justice Woods in United States v.
Britton, 108 U. S. 199, 204, that the offense consisted in the
conspiracy, and that the overt act afforded A locus ptenitentiam,
so that before the act done either one or all of the parties may
abandon their design, and thus avoid the penalty prescribed
by the statute. As the indictment in this case charges that
the conspiracy was entered into in the city of Washington, it
becomes unnecessary to consider whether an indictment will
lie within the jurisdiction where the overt act was committed,
though there are many authorities to that effect. King v.
Brisac, 4 East Rep. 164; People v. Mather, 4 Wend. (N. Y.) 229;
Commonwealth v. Gillespie, 7 S. & R. 469; Noyes v. State, 41
N. J. Law, 418; Commonwealth v. Corlies, 3 Brews. (Pa.) 575.
We have ourselves decided that, if the conspiracy be entered
into within the jurisdiction of the trial court, the iadictment
will lie there, though the overt act is shown to have been com-

HYDE v. SHINE.

mitted in another jurisdiction, or even in a foreign country.
Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539; In re Palliser, 136 U. S.
257; King v. Brisac, 4 East Rep. 164; Rev.-Stat. § 731.
In this connection it is also suggested that, as the conspiracy is alleged in all the counts to have been entered into
prior to January 1, 1902, as well as the overt act charged in
fifteen of the counts, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia cannot take cognizance of the case under the new code
which took effect upon that date, and that we must look to the
law prior thereto to determine the jurisdiction of that court.
By section 23, Chap. 35, of the Compiled Statutes of the District of Columbia, it was enacted that "the Criminal Court of
the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction of all crimes
,dd misdemeanors committed in said District, not lawfully
triable in any other court, and which are required by law to be
prosecuted by indictment or information."
The argument is made that, as the conspiracy in this case
was triable in California or Oregon, as well as in the District
of Columbia, it was lawfully triable in another court, and hence
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia has no jurisdiction. We are not impressed with the force of this contention. Chapter 35 provides for the organization of the judiciary
of the District of Columbia, and relates' exclusively to the
jurisdiction and powers of the several courts of the District,
providing that one of the justices may hold a Criminal Court,
and tha- such court shall have jurisdiction of all crimes and
misdemeanors committed in said District not lawfully triable
in any other court, and which are required by law to be, prosecuted by indictment or information. It is entirely clear that
this has reference only to other courts within the District, and
was not intended to change the law with respect to the general
jurisdiction of courts having jurisdiction of the same offense.
Although it involves a seeming hardship to commit an
accused person in San Francisco for trial in the District of
Columbia, the terms of Rev. Stat. § 1014 are as applicable to
such a case as they would be if the arrest- were made in Balti-

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

199 U. S.

more.- The section makes no discrimination based upon distance, and requires the commitment to be made for trial before
the court having cognizance of the offense, wherever that court
may sit. Where the statute contains no exception, the courts
cannot create one. Indeed, the Constitution itself requires
that the trial of all crimes shall be held in the State where the
crimes have been committed, and the power of Congress to
order the surrender of accused persons from other States is a
necessary complement to the duty of trying offenses in the
jurisdiction where the crime was committed. But we do not
wish to be understood as approving the practice of indicting
citizens of distant States in the courts of this District, where
an indictment will lie in the State of the domicil of such person,
unless in exceptional cases where the circumstances seem to
demand that this course shall be taken. To require a citizen to
undertake a long journey across the continent to face his accusers, and to incur the expense of taking his witnesses, and of
employing counsel in a distant city, involves a serious hardship to which he ought not to be subjected, if the case can be
tried in a court of his own jurisdiction. 3. The third assignment-that the indictment charges no
offense against the United States-requires a statement of its
substance. As it contains forty-two different counts and covers
some ninety-four pages of printed matter, a consideration of
each count would unnecessarily prolong this opinion. The
conspiracy charged embraced certain false practices by the
defendants, whereby school lands were to be obtained fraudulently from the States of California and Oregon by Hyde and
Benson, (1) in the names of fictitious persons, and (2) in the
names of persons not qualified to purchase the same, whereby
the said Hyde and Benson were to cause and require such
school lands to be relinquished by means of false and forged
relinquishments, assignments and conveyances to the United
States, in exchange for public lands to be selected, and for
titles thereto by patents to be obtained by and on behalf of
the said Hyde and Benson. A further element of the con-

HYDE v. SHINE.
199 U. S!,

Opinion of the Court.

spiracy is that defendants were, by bribery, to induce certain
United States officials in the General Land Office at Washington, in the District of Columbia, corruptly and contrary to
their official duties, to aid defendants to secure the approval
of their fraudulent selections, in advance of their regular order,
and to inform defendants of any discovery or investigation by
the Government of their said fraudulent practices.
To grasp the significance of these somewhat complicated
counts, and to appreciate the details of the offense charged, it
should be borne in mind that the Government had granted to
California and Oregon large tracts of lands, many of which
were covered with forests, known as school lands. Congress
subsequently changed its intention with regard to them and
desired to retain them as forest reserves, and to reacquire the
title thereto, and for that purpose, enacted a law approved
June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 11, 36, as follows:
"That in cases in which a tract covered by an unperfected
bona fide claim or by a patent is included within the limits of
a public forest reservation, the settler or owner thereof may,
if he desires to do so, relinquish the tract to the Government,
and may select in lieu thereof a tract of vacant land open to
settlement not exceeding in area the tract covered by his
claim or patent; and no charge shall be made in such cases for
making the entry of record or issuing the patent to cover the
tract selected."
It seems that both of these States had passed laws by which
any citizen of the United States resident in such State, or any
person who had declared his intention to become a citizen,
might acquire from such States a section or half section of
such lands at $1.25 per acre. They were required to make
application to the land offices of the State, and to make the
necessary affidavits to show that they were qualified to purchase them, and that they were purchasing them for their own
use or benefit, and had not sold or agreed to sell the same.
Doubtless the intention was that the sale should be made to
persons who desired to settle upon the lands, but there was

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

nothing to prohibit such persons from afterwards disposing
of them by assigning the certificates of purchase, and in this
method the assignee might, by purchase from several patentees,
acquire title to an unlimited amount of such lands, and might
thereafter exchange such lands under the act of June 4, 1897,
with the United States, provided he had acquired a valid title
from the States, and convey the same to the United States in
lieu of the land to be granted by the Government.
The argument of the defendants that while the procuring
of these school lands from the States through persons who
were not qualified to purchase them, and did not desire to
purchase them for their own use, and by supporting their application by false affidavits and forged assignments of the
certificates of purchase, might have been a violation of the
policy of the States of California and Oregon, and a fraud upon
such States, it fails to show that the United States could in any
way have been defrauded. The argument assumes that the
title acquired by the defendants from the States in question
was such a title as, upon conveyance to the United States,
would vest in the latter a title good as against all the world,
and therefore that the United States was not defrauded.
While it is doubtless true that, by means of these corrupt
and fraudulent practices, Hyde and Benson may have obtained titles to these lands, it does not follow, that the States
might not have disaffirmed such titles and recovered the lands.
In this particular the case is covered by that of Moffat v.
United States, 112 U. S.24. Nor does it follow that, when
subsequent conveyances were made to the United States of
these lands under the act of June 4, 1897, a good title was
-vested in the grantee. In the Moffat case it was held that a
patent issued to a fictitious person conveys no title which can
be transferred to a person subsequently purchasing in good
faith from a supposed owner. In delivering the opinion of the
court, Mr. Justice Field observed: "The patents being isswed
to fictitious parties could not transfer the title, and no qne
could derive any right under a conveyance in the name of the

HYDE v. SHINE.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

supposed patentees. A patent to a fictitious person is, in legal
effect, no more than a declaration that the Government thereby
conveys the property to no one. There is, in such case, no
room for the-application of the doctrine that a subsequent
bona fide purchaser is protected. A subsequent purchaser is
bound to know whether there was, in fact, a patentee, a person
once in being, and not a mere myth, and he will always be
presumed to take his conveyance upon the knowledge of the
truth in this respect. To the application of this doctrine of
a bona fide purchaser there must be a genuine instrument, having a legal existence, as well as one appearing on its face to
pass the title. It cannot arise on a forged instrument or one
executed to fictitious parties, that is, to no parties at all,
however much deceived thereby the purchaser may be."
The argument that this indictment cannot be sustained
because the United States, having received the school lands in
lieu of the lands patented, were defrauded of nothing, if valid
at all, applies equally to the school lands for which the States
of California and Oregon must have received a statutory compensation, fixed at $1.25 per acre. Having received this compensation it may be said, with equal propriety, that they were
defrauded of nothing. The result of the argument then is that,
although a gross imposition was practiced upon the States,
by the procuring of patents in favor of fictitious persons or of
disqualified persons by the use of forged affidavits, assignments or other documents, no indictment therefor would lie
because the States had received the same consideration they
would have received had the patents been issued to persons
qualified under the statutes to purchase the lands. The unsoundness of this argument needs no demonstration. The
States have a right to punish a violation of a statute enacted
as part of its public policy, notwithstanding they may have
suffered no pecuniary damage therefrom.
The same argument applies to the United States whose lands
have been procured in plain violation of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the statute, and by a further step in the same frauduvof,. cxcix-6

199 U. S;

lent scheme. By the act of June 4,.1897, 30 Stat. 36, it is
provided that any case in which a tract is covered by an unperfected bona fide claim, or by a patent, is included within
the limits of a public forest reservation, the settler or owner
thereof may, if he desires to do so, relinquish the tract to the
Government, etc. The privilege of the act is therefore reserved to a settler or owner, and as there is no claim that Hyde
was a settler upon the lands, it only remains to consider whether
he was an "owner" within the act. Although the word owner
has a variety of meanings and may, under certain circumstances, include an equitable as well as a legal ownership, or
even a right of present use and possession, it implies something
more than a bare legal title, and we know of no authority for
saying that a person in possession of land under a void deed
can be regarded as the owner thereof. Ownership may not
imply a perfect title, but it implies something more than the
possession of land under a title which is void; and when the
Government holds out to owners of lands an inducement to
relinquish sach lands in exchange for others, it implies that
the persons with whom it is dealing, if not the owners in fee
simple, are at least bona fide owners, with authority to dispose
of and vest a good title thereto. We are clear that the defendant does not fall within this category and that the United
States may justly claim to have been defrauded out of the land
patented to him. Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil
Co., 190 U. S. 301, 308; Johnson v. Crookshanks, 21 Oregon,
339; Directors &c. v. Abila, 106 California, 355.
Whatever may be the rule in equity as to the necessity of
proving an actual loss or damage to the plaintiff, we think a
case is made out under this statute by proof of a conspiracy to
defraud and the commission of an overt act, notwithstanding
the United States may have received a consideration for the
lands and suffered no pecuniary loss. MacLaren v. Cothran,
44 Minnesota, 255. The law punishes the false practices by
which the lands were obtained, and the question whether the
Government stands in the position of a bona fide purchaser

HYDE v. SHINE.
199 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

with respect to the school lands is not one which can be litigated
in a criminal prosecution for a violation of law.
Even if the United States were in a position to claim the
rights of a bona fide purchaser to the state lands, the methods
by which these lands were acquired from the States, and the
lands in exchange therefor procured from the United States,
would be none the less a fraud of which the latter might take
advantage in a criminal prosecution. The indictment under
section 5440 charges a conspiracy to defraud the United States
out of the possession, use of and title thereto of divers large
tracts of public lands, and if the title to these lands were obtained by fraudulent practices and in pursuance of a fraudulent
design, it is none the less within the statute, though the United
States might succeed in defeating a recovery of the state lands
by setting up the rights of a bona fide purchaser. Under the
circumstances it cannot be doubted that the United States
might maintain a bill to cancel the patents to the exchanged
lands procured by these fraudulent means, notwithstanding
its title to the forest reserve lands might be good.
Other minor objections are taken to the indictment; that no
description is given of the lands out of which the defendants
are alleged to have conspired to defraud the Government,
Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539, 543; that it is uncertain
in its allegations as to the means to be used to carry out the
alleged conspiracy; that the names representing the fictitious
persons and of those not qualified to purchase, through whom
the fraud was effected, are not given; that the allegations of
the indictment are indefinite and iriconsistent; that the conclusion is improper, etc.
It is sufficient to say of these objections that they are proper
to be considered by the trial court, and that we do not feel
called upon to express our own opinion in regard to them.
Criticisms of this character are completely covered by the recent
decision of this court in Benson v. Henkel, 198 U. S. 1, as well
as in the cases of Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 206, and Ex
parte Par.ks, 93 U. S. 18, in both of which the petitioners sought

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

199 U. S.

by writs of habeas corpus to review the validity of certain indictments under which they had been convicted in the courts
below and in both this court declined to review the action of
the court below. It was held that the question whether the
act charged was or was not a crime was one which the trial
court was competent to decide, and which this court would
not review upon a writ of habeas corpus.
Our conclusion is that for the purposes of this case the indictment is sufficient.
4. The fourth assignment-that there was no probable
cause for believing the petitioner guilty of the offense charged
and that the writ of certiorari should have been issued to bring
the record before the court-is based upon that clause of section 1014, which requires that proceedings for the removal of
persons from one district to another shall be "agreeably to the
usual mode of process against offenders in such StAte," and section 1487 of the code of California is cited to the effect that the
petitioner shall be discharged where he has been committed
upon a criminal charge without reasonable or probable cause.
Certain cases are also cited from the Supreme Court of California, to the effect that it is the right of the prisoner to have the
court consider the question of probable cause upon the writ of
habeas corpus. People v. Smith, 1 California, 9; Ex Parte
Palmer, 86 California, 631; Ex Parte Walpole, 85 California,
362. But see contra Ex Parte Long, 114 California, 159.
In the Federal courts, however, it is well settled that upon
habeas corpus the court will not weigh the evidence, although
if there is an entire lack of evidence to support the accusation
the court may order his discharge. In this case, however,
the production of the indictment made at least a prima jacie
case against the accused, and if the Commissioner received
evidence on his behalf it was for him to say whether upon the
whole testimony there was proof of probable cause. In Re
Oteiza, 136 U. S.; 330; Bryant v. United States, 167 U. S. 104.
The requirement that the usual mode of process adopted in
the State shall be pursued refers to the proceedings for the

arrest and examination of the accused before the Commissioner, but it has no bearing upon the subsequent independent proceeding before the Circuit Court upon habeas corpus.
In this case the Commissioner did receive evidence on behalf
of the appellants, and upon suck evidence found the existence
of probable cause and committed the defendants, and upon
application to the District Judge for the warrant of removal
he reviewed his action, but did not pass upon the weight of
the evidence.
While the Circuit Court may have had power to issue a writ
of certiorari auxiliary to the writ of habeas corpus, Ex Parte
Burford, 3 Cranch, 448; In Re Martin, 5 Blatch. 303; Ex
Partq Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75, 100; Church on Habeas Corpus,
sec. 260, it was under no obligation to do so, and its refusal cannot be assigned as error. Certiorari is a discretionary writ,
and is often denied where the power to issue it is unquestionable. People v. Supervisors, 15 Wend. 198, 206; People v. Stilwell, 19 N. Y. 531; Rowe v. Rowe, 28 Michigan, 353. Petitions
for habeas corpus are frequently accompanied by applications
for certiorari as ancillary thereto, and both are awarded or
denied together. Appellant had nothing to complain of in
the denial of the writ, and his petition should have set forth the
evidence relied upon to show a want of probable cause. Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 279; Craemer v. Washington,

conspiracy was entered into in Washington, District of Columbia, on December 30, 1901, and the opinion holds, in substance
(and rightly, as I think), that it is essential to aver its information in the District in order to give the courts therein jurisdiction of the offense. The indictment constitutes prima
facie evidence of probable cause, but evidence may be given to
rebut it. It is averred in the application for the writs of habeas
corpus and certiorari, in the case of Hyde, that the evidence
taken before the Commissioner showed indisputably that the
petitioner was never in the District of Columbia, except upon
one occasion in 1901, and then only for about six hours, and
that he was not then guilty of any of the offenses charged in
the indictment; and in the case of Dimond, it was said the evidence showed that the transactions complained of as a conspiracy occured in California or Oregon, of which former State the
defendant was, and had been for twenty years, a resident.
In other words, i' was claimed that the evidence before the Commissioner showed conclusively and without contradiction that
there was no probable cause to believe the defendants guilty
of any offense, as charged in the indictment. The writ of certiorari was called for in order that this evidence might be
brought before the Circuit Judge, so that he could see from it
that there was affirmative and conclusive proof of the absence
of probable cause. The applications for the writs of habeas
corpus and of certiorari were both denied. The opinion of the
Circuit Judge, delivered upon refusing the writs, shows that
the question of the want of probable cause to believe the defendants guilty, based upon the absence of both defendants from
the District of Columbia at the time of the alleged formation of
the conspiracy, was not touched upon by him, but the objections considered were those based upon the charge contained
in the indictment, and whether it charged an offense under the
laws of the United States. This court now holds that the refusal of the judge to grant the writ of certiorari was within his
discretion.
I think this is not the case for the application of the rule

refused in such cases to grant the writ. The result of the refusal in this case is to prevent the review of the findings of the
Commissioner before whom the original proceeding was had,
upon the question of probable cause. I admit that the weight
of evidence will not in such cases be reviewed here, but evidence
which conclusively rebuts the presumption of probable cause
arising from the indictment and which is uncontradicted, may

be looked at, and a finding of probable cause reversed.

In

order to refer to it the evidence must be part of the record, and
in such a case as this the application for a writ of certiorari to
bring up the evidence which the petitioner avers shows such

fact is not addressed to the discretion of the court, but on the
contrary the petitioner has the right to demand that it shall be
granted. The right is none the less, when the want of probable
cause rests upon conclusive evidence of the absence of the defendants from the district at the time when the indictment alleges the conspiracy was formed in such district. If defendants
were not then there, they could not be guilty of the crime
charged in the indictment. This case is an extreme illustration of the very great hardship involved in sending a man
3,000 miles across the continent, from California or Oregon, to

this District for trial, where he is to bring his witnesses, and
where on such trial it will appear that the court must direct an
acquittal, because the averment of the formation of the conspiracy at Washington, D. C., is shown to be false to a demonstration.
The expense to a defendant in his necessary preparation for
trial, and in procuring the attendance of witnesses in his behalf from such a distance, must necessarily be enormous, and
in many, if not in most cases, utterly beyond the ability of a
defendant to pay. The enforcement of the criminal law should
not be made oppressive in such cases, and, therefore, when it
