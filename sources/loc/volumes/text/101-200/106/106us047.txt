step, or contracting the vertical arm in width and putting ou
the lower end of it a horizontal piece parallel with the step
and overlying it, involved no new principle of structure or
operation.
There is no suggestion in the specification of the original
patent that the plate E is to be used disconnected at its lower
end from the step, or to be any other than a yielding plate, so
arranged as to keep the door open and shut, in addition to acting as a step-cover and wheel-fender. The first claim of the
reissue, if construed so as to cover the defendant's structure,
is void for want of novelty, being anticipated by the old structures referred to. Moreover, if so construed, it is invalid as
being for a different invention from any found in the original
patent. And, if it is so limited as to be no broader than the
claim of the original patent, there has been no infringement of
it. Under any view, the decree of the court below was correct; and it is
Affirmed.

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES RAILROAD COMPANY v. FOSDICK.
SAMIE v. HUIDEKOPER.
1. A railroad company executed, March 10, 1869, to a trustee, by way of security for its bonds payable thirty years thereafter, a first mortgage upon
its road, and stipulated that if "default should be made in the payment of
any half-year's interest on any of them, and the coupon for such interest
be presented and its payment demanded, and such default continue six
months after such demand without the consent of the holder of such coupon
or bond, then and thereupon the principal of all of the bonds thereby secured should be and become immediately due and payable, anything in the
bonds to the contrary notwithstanding; and the trustee might so declare
the same, and notify the company thereof; and, upon the written request
of the holders of a majority of the bonds then outstanding, should proceed
to collect both principal and interest of all such bonds outstanding by
foreclosure and sale of said property, or otherwise, as therein provided."
Claiming that there had been a default for more than six months after a
demand for the payment of the coupons due in 1873, the trustee declared
the principal of the bonds to be due, and notified the company thereof.
He then, without obtaining the written request of a majority of the holders
of the bonds outstanding, brought suit praying for a decree for a sum equal
to the entire amount of the bonds and interest due thereon, and for the

foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property. Held, that, if tdiere had
been such default, he was not entitled to the decree.
Where by the stipulations of the mortgage it is a security for the payment
of the interest as it semi-annually accrues, as well as of the principal, the
trustee, on the non-payment of either, or, on his failure to act, any bondholder, may, to enforce the security, bring suit, and if it results in a sale
of the mortgaged premises as an entirety which is confirmed by the court,
the purchaser takes an absolute title to them as against the parties to the
suit or their privies, and the proceeds of the sale will be applied first to
the arrears of interest, then to the mortgage debt, then to the junior incumbrances, according to their respective priority of lien, and the surplus, if
any, will be paid to the mortgagor.
In such a suit; the decree should declare the fact, nature, and extent of the
default which constitutes the breach of the condition of the mortgage, and
the amount then due, and a substantial error in that regard will, on appeal,
vitiate the subsequent proceedings. A reasonable time for payment should
be allowed, and, on such payment within the prescribed period, further
proceedings will be suspended until another default occurs. At any time
prior to the confirmation of the sale under the decree, the mortgagor, by
bringing into court the amount then due, and costs, will be allowed to redeem. Howell v. Western Railroad Comnpany, 9-4 U. S. 463, touching the form
of the decree where moneys payable by instalments are secured by mortgage, cited and approved.
An appeal may lie from a decree in an equity cause, notwithstanding it is
merely in execution of. a prior decree in the same suit, for the purpose of
correcting errors which originate in it; but when such decrees are dependent upon the decree, to execute which they were rendered, they are vacated
by its reversal; in which case, the appeal which brings them into review
will be dismissed for want of a subject-matter on which to operate.
A decree in personam for the amount remaining due upon a mortgage debt,

by the Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company

upon its railroad, and for a sale of the mortgaged premises.
A decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill was rendered, and under it a sale was had and confirmed by the court.
From these decrees respectively the present appeals are prosecuted.
The bonds, amounting to $2,500,000 in all, secured by the
mortgage in question, were dated March 10, 1869, and payable
April 1, 1909, with interest at the rate of seven per cent per
annum, payable semi-annually on the first day of April and
October of each year, on the delivery of annexed interest warrants in the city of New York, at such place as might be designated by the company, by advertisement published in that
city. The mortgage bears even date with them, and, after
reciting the resolutions of the board of directors which authorize
the issue of the bonds and the execution of the mortgage, conveys to Fosdick and Fish, as trustees, and to their successors
and assigns, the road of the company, extending from its terminus, in Chicago, southerly through certain named counties
to Danville, and thence southeasterly to a point on the State
line of Indiana, connecting at that point with the Evansville,
Terre Haute, and Chicago Railroad, being in length about one
hundred and fifty miles, "including all the property between
said terminal points, which said party of the first part now has
and possesses, or may hereafter acquire," &c.
The conditions and trusts, upon which the conveyance is
made, are expressed in a series of articles, nine in number, of
which it is important to notice only the following: The fifth article provides, in substance, that in case default
shall be made in the payment of any interest, or of the principal of any of said bonds, without the consent of the holder, the
company shall, within six months thereafter, the same default
still continuing, on demand of the trustees, surrender to them
possession of the road and mortgaged property; the trustees
operating the same shall apply the net profits and income to the
payment of the interest so in default until such default shall
have been satisfied, when the mortgaged premises shall be surrendered to the mortgagor; but it is provided that no such
demand for possession shall be made by the trustees until they
shall have been required to take such possession by the holders
VOL. XVI.

50

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES

R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

of at least one-half of all of the said issue of bonds then unpaid
and outstanding.
The sixth article provides further, that in case default shall
be made and shall continue as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for
the trustees, after entry into possession, taken as above authorized, or other entry, or without entry, to sell and dispose of, to
the highest bidder, the mortgaged premises, as an entirety, at
public auction, in Chicago, at such time as they may appoint,
first having demanded of the mortgagor payment of all money
then in default, and having given sixty days' notice of the time
and place of sale, by advertisement, as specified; and to convey
the same, when sold, to the purchaser, on payment of the purchase-money, in fee-simple, which conveyance, it is declared,
shall be a perpetual bar, in law and equity, against the title of
the mortgagor, or any other person claiming under it. The net
proceeds of such sale are to be applied by the trustees to the
payment of the interest on the bonds then outstanding, pro rata,
until all such interest shall be paid, and afterwards to the payment of the principal; and any surplus, to the mortgagor, - the
payments to be made on the bonds, whether the same shall
then have become due or not.
By the seventh article it is provided that at any sale of the
mortgaged premises, made under the power contained in the
deed, or by judicial authority, the trustees may become purchasers of the same in behalf of the bondholders, at a price, in
case the sale is of the whole property as an entirety, not exceeding the whole amount of said bonds and interest then outstanding.
The eighth article is as follows: " 8th. If default be made by the party of the first part in the
payment of any half-year's interest on any of said bonds, and the
warrant or coupon for such interest shall have been presented, and
its payment demanded, and such default shall have continued six
months after such demand, without the consent of the holder of
such coupon or bond, then and thereupon the principal of all of the
said bonds hereby secured shall be and become immediately due and
payable, anything in such bonds to the contrary notwithstanding;
and the said party of the second part may so declare the same,
and notify the party of the first part thereof, and upon the written

51

request of the holders of a majority of the said bonds then outstanding, shall proceed to collect both principal and interest of all such
bonds outstanding, by foreclosure and sale of said property, or otherwise, as herein provided."
It is averred in the amended bill of Fosdick and Fish that
all the bonds described in the mortgage had been issued and
were outstanding.
It is also alleged that on March 4, 1872, the Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company became consolidated
into one corporation, by the same name, with the Rossville
and Indiana Railroad Company; and on March 9, 1872, a further consolidation was effected, by the same name, with the
Western Railroad Company, an Indiana corporation, whereby
the consolidated company was empowered to build and operate
a railroad, from the State line in Warren County, to Brazil, in
Indiana; and that on March 12, 1872, the consolidated company, to raise means wherewith to construct its Indiana Division, issued its bonds to the amount of $1,500,000, bearing
interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum, and payable
forty years after date; to secure which, on the same day, it
executed a mortgage to Fosdick and Fish, the complainants,
covering its Indiana Division, and a branch road extending from
a point three miles south from Covington to the village of Newburg, being about eighty miles in all. All the bonds secured
by this mortgage were issued.
It is further alleged, that, as further security for both these
issues of bonds, the company, on April 24, 1872, executed
another mortgage to the complainants, conveying the Indiana
Division as security for the first issue of bonds on the Illinois
Division, and conveying the Illinois Division as security for the
bonds issued originally on the Indiana Division. The company
made a subsequent consolidation on May 6, 1872, under the same.
name, with the Attica and Terre Haute Railroad Company.
The road as built in Illinois extends from Dalton about
twenty miles south of Chicago to Danville, about one hundred
and eight miles, with a branch from Bismark in Vermilion
County to the east line of the State of Illinois, about seven
miles. It obtains an entrance into Chicago over the roads of
other companies. The company has constructed, in Indiana,

62

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v.

FosDIcx.

[Sup. Ct.

its line from a point where the Bismark branch intersects the
State line, a distance of eighteen miles, and has done a large
proportion of the work required to carry its road to Brazil.
It is further alleged that the company paid all coupons on
both classes of bonds maturing on and prior to April 1, 1878,
but that "none of the coupons maturing since that time, or
any part thereof, have ever been paid, but the said company,
though often requested, has never paid the same, but so to do
has made default."
Shortly after the first default on Oct. 1, 1873, to wit, on
Nov. 11, 1878, the company issued a circular to the holders of
its bonds, proposing to fund the coupons maturing from Oct. 1,
1873, to April 1, 1875, in convertible seven per cent bonds,
to be issued for that purpose, the coupons to be deposited with
Fosdick, one of the complainants, as a trustee, to be held by
him until Oct. 1, 1876, when they were to be cancelled, but in
case of non-payment of any coupons becoming due up to Oct. 1,
1876, the coupons deposited with the trustee were to be returned to the original owners, and the second mortgage or convertible bonds surrendered to the company.
In response to this proposition coupons to a considerable
amount were deposited with the trustee and convertible bonds
received in exchange.
Soon after, on Nov. 20, 1873, another proposition was submitted to the bondholders, to exchange these four coupons for
certificates of indebtedness payable in five years from Feb. 1,
1874, with interest payable semi-annually, the coupons to be
held by the trustee until after that date, when they were to be
cancelled ; but in case of non-payment of the interest or principal of the certificates, or of the coupons on the first-mortgage
bonds, between Oct. 1, 1875, and Feb. 1, 1879, both inclusive,
then the coupons were to be returned by the trustee to their
owners, upon surrender of their certificates, with their original
rights unimpaired.
It is alleged that the holders of $2,801,000 of both classes
of bonds accepted one or the other of these propositions, and
deposited their coupons accordingly.
To secure the convertible bonds referred to in the first proposition, a mortgage was executed by the company, of which

Oct. 1882.]

R.R. Co. v.

58

James W. Elwell was trustee, to the amount of $1,000,000,
payable, with interest semi-annually at the rate of seven per
cent per annum, on Feb. 1, 1893, covering the entire line and
both divisions of the railroad. It is alleged in the bill that all
these bonds, except about $45,000, have been issued.
It is charged that the company failed to pay all the coupons
upon the certificates of indebtedness due Feb. 22, 1875, and
that it has not paid any that fell due Aug. 1, 1875. It is also
charged that the company has never paid any of the coupons
upon any of the $4,000,000 of bonds, which were not funded
and which matured subsequent to Oct. 1, 1873, amounting to
$1,199,000, and that the coupons thereon are overdue and remain unpaid, the owners thereof never having consented to such
default; and it is alleged that the company is wholly insolvent.
It is further shown that on June 12, 1875, the railroad company made a further issue of bonds to the amount of $1,000,000,
due Jan. 12, 1877, and to secure the same executed a chattel
mortgage to R. Biddle Roberts, upon its rolling-stock, engines,
cars, tools, and equipment; but it is charged that the same
was not executed, acknowledged, and recorded as required by
law, and is, therefore, null and void; but that, if valid, it is
subject to each of the three mortgages of prior date. About
$936,000 of these bonds, it is averred, are held as collateral to
debts due by the company, the remainder not having been
issued.
It is claimed, also, that by reason of its insolvency the company will not be able to pay the certificates of indebtedness
issued by it, or the interest thereon, and that, in consequence
of its failure to pay the interest thereon already accrued, the
owners of the unpaid coupons of the $4,000,000 of bonds are
entitled to rescind the funding arrangement, and to demand
and enforce payment of the coupons funded as aforesaid.
It is further alleged that, "by reason of the default of said
company in the payment of the coupons due Oct. 1, 1873, and
subsequent thereto, which have never been funded, the principal of all of the said bonds has, by the terms and conditions of
the mortgage securing the same, become due and payable;
and all of the said Illinois Division bonds and of the said
Indiana Division bonds were, by the terms and conditions of

54

oICAGo AND VINCENNES R.R. CO. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

the mortgage securing the same, and in consequence of the
defaults aforesaid, due and payable prior to the commencement of this suit. Your orators further allege that, of the
said Illinois Division bonds, $698,000 thereof have never been
funded by the holders thereof, and the holders thereof have
never in any way consented to the continuance of the default
in the payment of interest thereon. Your orators allege that
they have been requested by the holders of a majority of said
Illinois Division, and also by the holders of a large number of
the said Indiana bonds, to proceed to collect the principal and
interest of said bonds by foreclosure and sale of all of the railroad, franchises, property, and appurtenances of said company
within the State of Illinois."
It is also alleged that the Indiana Division of the road is
wholly insufficient to secure the payment of the Indiana Division bonds, and that, while the Illinois Division is more than
sufficient to secure the payment of the Illinois Division bonds
in full, it is not sufficient in addition to pay in full the whole
of the Indiana Division bonds.
The original bill was filed Feb. 27, 1875, and made no party
defendant except the company. It contained the following
averments, which are not found in the amended bill: " Your orators further show to your Honors that they have
been required by the holders of more than one-half of the
twenty-five hundred bonds to demand possession of the said
railroad property, franchises, and appurtenances of and from
the said railroad company, and have made such demand in
pursuance of said requirement, but that said railroad company
has not delivered the possession thereof to your orators, but
so to do have wholly neglected and refused.
" Your orators further show unto your Honors that they are
informed and believe, and therefore charge the fact to be, that
at least ninety per cent of the said coupons which matured
upon said bonds on the first day of October, 1873, have been
duly presented for payment to the said railroad company, and
payment thereof demanded from said company, and that the
same have never been paid, nor any part thereof ; and that the
holders of six hundred and ninety-eight of said bonds have
never in any way consented to the continuance of said default;

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

55

and that, in consequence of the continuance of said default,
without the consent of said holders of said six hundred and
ninety-eight bonds, the principal and interest of all of the said
bonds have become due and payable, and that your orators, as
trustees as aforesaid, under and by virtue of the provisions of
said mortgage, and the authority therein conferred upon them,
have declared the principal of all of said bonds to be due and
payable, and have notified the said railroad company thereof."
On May 17, 1875, James W. Elwell, acting trustee in the
mortgage of Dec. 16, 1872, appeared and filed a cross-bill, setting out the terms of the mortgage, the issue of the bonds
secured thereby, and alleging that, while the interest upon
about $160,000 of the bonds had been paid by the company,
that upon the remainder was wholly unpaid. The cross-bill
proceeds to set out the particulars of the agreements alleged to
have been entered into between the railroad company and the
holders of its first-mortgage bonds, and continues with the following averments: "And your orator therefore avers that said corporation is
not in default in the payment of interest upon its said firstmortgage bonds to the amount of one million eight hundred
and two thousand dollars, but on the contrary your orator
avers that said company has adjusted and settled with the
holders of said bonds to the amount as above stated, and received an extension of payment of all such interest coupons
now past due and that will mature prior to the first day of
October, 1875.
"Your orator states that said corporation has paid to the
holders of said certificates of indebtedness all interest coupons
attached to said certificates as the same matured, and in accordance with the terms thereof, which had been presented before
the appointment of the receiver, as hereinafter stated.
"And your orator represents, upon information and belief,
that the holders of the balance of said issue of twenty-five
hundred bonds have acquiesced in said extension of payment
of interest and excused such default, and have not demanded
the payment of their interest coupons nor attempted to enforce
the collection of the same.
"And your orator further states that notwithstanding said

66

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES Rl.R. 00. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup.

Ct.

agreement of the holders of said first-mortgage bonds to extend
the payment of said interest warrants as hereinbefore stated,
and the payment of the interest at maturity by said company
upon said certificates of indebtedness, yet your orator is informed and believes, and so charges the fact to be, that by
reason of divers persons claiming and pretending to be in the
interest of a part of said first-mortgage bondholders combining
and confederating to wrong and injure your orator and the
holders of said second or convertible mortgage bonds and other
creditors of said corporation, said company was by the action
.of the Circuit Court of Will County, in said State of Illinois,
on the 22d of February last past, wrongfully and unlawfully
dispossessed of all its property so conveyed to your orator by
said deed of trust; that all of said property, together with
the rights, privileges, and franchises of said company, were on
said 22d of February wrongfully and fraudulently taken from
the custody and -control of said company, and without the
knowledge or consent of said corporation, your orator, or of
the defendants herein, placed in the charge and under the
custody of strangers to said company, and to each of said deeds
of trust; that said parties still wrongfully retain the possession
of said property and control the revenue and income thereof,
thereby preventing said company and your orator from providing funds for the payment of the interest warrants to mature
upon the bonds secured by said trust deed so made to your
orator, thereby endangering such property and materially depreciating the value of such securities.
"Your orator further states that he is advised and believes,
and charges the fact to be, that the property conveyed to the
defendants, Fosdick and Fish, by the trust deed so made to
them, greatly exceeds in value the amount of bonds so issued
under their said deed of trust; and that the net income or revenue derived from a proper and economical use of said property
is, and will continue to be, more than sufficient to pay all of the
interest warrants as they may become due and payable on all
the bonds issued under the said deed of trust.
"And your orator further states, upon information and belief,
that certain holders of bonds issued under the deed of trust so
made to the defendants, Fosdick and Fish, trustees as aforesaid,

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FoSDICK.

57

whose names your orator will furnish if required by this honorable court, have resolved and determined to demand and require
of them that they shall without delay declare the principal of
all of their said bonds presently due and payable, and that they
shall prosecute said action to a speedy decree of foreclosure of
said trust mortgage, and shall enforce sale of all the pioperty
and franchises of said railroad company under said decree,
thereby rendering the security of the bonds issued under the
deed to your orator utterly valueless.
"And your orator avers that such action will be grossly unjust and inequitable towards the cestuis que trust of your orator
and other creditors of said company, especially as about eighty
per cent of all of said bondholders have extended the payment
of their said interest warrants as hereinbefore stated, and
waived and excused the default of said company in the payment of said interest.
"And your orator further represents, upon information and
belief, that none of the holders of the bonds issued under the
said trust deed executed to the defendants, except a very inconsiderable number thereof, have presented to and demanded of
said railroad company payment of any of the past-due interest
warrants or coupons of said bonds, as required by the eighth
article or condition of said trust deed, and, therefore, your orator
says that the said trustees, Fosdick and Fish, have no authority
under said trust deed to proceed to collect the principal of said
bonds by foreclosure and sale or otherwise."
The amended bill of Fosdick and Fish, of which an abstract
has already been given, was filed Sept. 14, 1875. Its prayer for
relief is that the said Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company, and the said James W. Elwell, whose appearance has already been entered in this cause as parties defendant
thereto, may be required to answer this, your orators', amended
bill, but without oath, which is hereby expressly waived, and
that the said R. Biddle Roberts may be made party defendant
hereto, and summoned to answer this, your orators', bill, but
without oath, which is hereby expressly waived; and that the
receiver heretofore appointed upon the prayer of the original bill
in this cause may still hold the said railroad, its equipment
and appurtenances, and operate the same under the order and

58

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES

R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

direction of this honorable court; and that an account be taken
of the amount due by the said railroad company upon the said
Illinois Division bonds, and upon the said Indiana Division
bonds separately, and that the said railroad company be ordered
to pay the amount so found due upon said bonds, severally,
within a short time, to be limited by this honorable court, and
that upon default thereof the said Illinois Division of the said
railroad, together with all of the franchises, equipment, and
appurtenances thereof, may be sold by the master in chancery
of this court, for the payment, first, of the said 2,500 Illinois
Division bonds; and, secondly, of the 1,500 Indiana Division
bonds, which are the first and second liens upon the said Illinois
Division of said railroad, its equipments, franchise, and property,
as hereinbefore set forth, or for such other and further relief as
to your Honors shall seem meet, and to equity shall appertain.
On Oct. 23, 1875, the Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company filed a demurrer to so much of the amended bill
of Fosdick and Fish as charges that it will be impossible for
said company to fulfil the conditions of the funding agreements,
and that the holders of said certificates have the right to rescind
said agreements; and to so much of said amended bill as
charges that the principal of said bonds has become due and
payable.
On the same day it also filed an answer, containing, among
others, the following averments: "Said respondent says that on the twenty-second day of
February, A. D. 1875, one Stephen Osgood, without any notice
whatever to this respondent, upon his exparte application to
the judge of the Circuit Court of Will County, in the said State
of Illinois, wrongfully and fraudulently procured the appointment of receivers of all the property, assets, and income of the
said respondent within the State of Illinois, and that such receivers forcibly took possession of the offices and all the property of said respondent on said twenty-second day of February,
and by the aid of writs of assistance and other process issued
by said court, or the judge thereof, held the possession of all
said property of this respondent, its earnings and income, until
the first day of June, 1875, at which time said receivers were
removed by the order of this honorable court, and a receiver of

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO

AND VINCFNNES

R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

59

all such property appointed under the prayer of the complainants in the said original bill of complaint contained.
"And this respondent says that on said twenty-second day of
February it was not in default in the payment of any of said
certificate warrants that matured February 1st, 1875; that all
of said warrants were paid as presented to this respondent prior
to said twenty-second day of February, and that such balance of
$3,167.77 was not paid for the reason that the action of said
State court had deprived this respondent of the power to meet
such payments. But the said respondent denies that the said
corporation was, on said first day of February, 1875, insolvent
and unable to meet the payment of said certificate warrants, as
charged in said amended bill of complaint, but, on the contrary,
avers and charges that at all times after the maturity of said
interest, and until said twenty-second day of February, said
respondent had the pecuniary ability and was ready and willing
to pay all such interest, and did in fact pay all such interest
warrants when presented.
"And the said respondent further says and charges the fact
to be that the net earnings of said company, during the year
1874, and the months of January, February, April, and May,
of the present year, were more than sufficient to pay all the
interest accruing upon the bonds issued under the trust deed to
the complainants, and also the interest upon said certificates of
indebtedness, and upon all other mortgage bonds that had been
negotiated and sold by said respondent.
"And the said respondent says that the said company is not
in default in the payment of any certificate interest coupons,
after proper demand, and that, therefore, none of the holders
of said certificates are lawfully entitled to the return from the
said Fosdick, special trustee as aforesaid, of the bond interest
warrants so funded and deposited with the said Fosdick.
"Your respondent admits that the contracts for funding said
interest warrants are substantially set forth in said complainant's amended bill, and that the holders of about four-fifths of
the said 4,000 first-mortgage bonds then, and about three-fourths
of all now outstanding, entered into said agreement, and so
funded their said interest warrants.

60

[Sup. Ot.

"Your respondent further answering, says that it has no
knowledge, information, or belief of the number of said bondholders, under said deeds of trust, that have made demand upon
said complainants that they should execute their said trust; but
respondent says that said company is not, and was not at the
commencement of this action, in default to one-half of such
interest, and, therefore, respondent says that said, bondholders
had no right to make such demand, and neither were the complainants nor respondent required to accede to such demands,
by the terms of said trust deed.
"And the said respondent further answering, says that it has
no means of knowledge of the per cent of the holders of said
interest warrants that matured October 1st, 1873, that presented such warrants to the company and demanded payment
thereof; but respondent says, if it is true, as charged, that at
least ninety per cent made such demand, at least eighty per
cent of the entire number afterwards waived such payment, and
consented to an extension thereof, as hereinbefore stated, and
that as to such eighty per cent said company is in no default
whatever.
"And as to the holders of said six hundred and ninety-eight
of said bonds who did not fund their interest, the said respondent says, upon information and belief, and so charges, that a
large majority thereof have consented to such default in the
payment of said interest, and have assented to such extension;
that many of the holders of such bonds have expressed to the
officers of said company their assent to such extension, and
promised and agreed (but not in writing) that they would in
no manner interfere with, or by their adverse action defeat, the
plans of said company for the extension of payment of said
interest.
"And respondent further says that it has no knowledge that
any holder of said bonds ever elected to declare the principal
due on account of a default of said company, with the exception of the said Osgood, who only claimed to hold nine of said
bonds. And as to the said Osgood, the respondent says that,
to the best of its knowledge and belief, the said Osgood never
has, nor has any one at his request, ever demanded of said
company, or of any of its officers or agents, payment of any

R.R. Co. v. FosDIcK.

61

of the coupons attached to any of the nine bonds of which he
claims to be the owner, and that the only notice the respondent has ever had that the said Osgood had so elected, or that
he demanded payment of either principal or interest, was
derived from his said bill of complaint filed in said Circuit
Court of Will County, as aforesaid, on said twenty-second day
of February. And the said respondent further avers that on
the twenty-third day of February, 1875, the said defendant
offered and tendered the attorney of record of said Osgood, in
open court, in said county of Will, full payment, principal and
interest, of all the bonds held by the said Osgood, which was
refused by said attorney. And that respondent at the same
time offered to deposit in court the full amount of said principal and interest, upon condition that said receivers should be
discharged, and said property restored to said respondent,
which offer was refused."
On Jan. 6, 1876, a petition was filed by Stephen Osgood,
who bad commenced the original proceeding in the State
court on Feb. 22, 1875, and seven others; claiming to be
holders of bonds and coupons secured by the mortgages to
Fosdick and Fish, in which they recite the previous proceedings in respect to the bill filed by the latter, and allege, among
other things, that on Oct. 1, 1873, the railroad company had
made default in the payment of interest on its bonds, and that
large numbers of coupons maturing on that day were presented
at the office of the corporation in the city of New York, payment thereof duly demanded and refused. It also rehearses
the funding arrangements, and charges that as they were based
on false and fraudulent statements of the company, the owners
of the bonds, who funded their coupons, on the faith thereof,
are entitled to rescind the agreement and to enforce their
claims against the company; that Osgood had never funded his
coupons; that demand was made at the office of said corporation in New York, in December, 1874, for the payment of
sundry coupons due April 1, 1874, which were never funded or
agreed to be so, and that payment thereof was refused; that
the said presentment and non-payment were duly evidenced by
a public instrument of protest by a notary public in and for said
county and city of New York, and that the said coupons still

62

[Sup. Ct.

remain unpaid. More than six months having expired since the
demand of payment of said coupons in October, 1873, and the
default thereon, and more than six months having also expired
since the demand of payment of such coupons in December,
1874, and the default thereupon, the petitioners claim that by
the conditions of said conveyances the said principal of all
and singular the said bonds has also become due, and that
there is now due and owing by the said corporation the full
sum of $4,700,000 upon said first-mortgage indebtedness.
The petition prays for an account of the sums due on account of the said bonds, and that the mortgaged property be
sold to satisfy the same, &c.
An answer was filed by R. Biddle Roberts, setting up his
rights as trustee under the chattel mortgage; and James W.
Elwell also answers the amended bill, repeating substantially
the allegations of his cross-bill. Fosdick and Fish filed an
answer to the cross-bill of Elwell on March 10, 1876, and filed
general replications to all the answers to their amended bill.
Their answer to' the cross-bill contains the following averments: " These respondents, further answering, upon information
and belief, admit that certain holders of bonds under the deed
of trust to these respondents have determined to demand and
require of these respondents that they shall without delay
declare the principal of all of said bonds presently due and
payable, and will insist that these respondents proceed to
prosecute their original bill in this behalf to speedy foreclosure
and procure the sale of the property and franchises of said
railroad company to satisfy said bonds.
"These respondents, further answering, say that they are
also informed and believe, and therefore charge the fact to be,
that other holders of said bonds are in favor of and propose
to demand that no such foreclosure and sale shall be had for
the present, but what number of bondholders are in the one
class or in the other these respondents are not advised and
cannot state, but in that regard they say that they will endeavor
to faithfully perform all their duties as trustees in this behalf
and submit all such questions as may arise to the determination of this honorable court.

"Further answering, respondents say that they are not
advised, and cannot state, what precise number the holders of
past-due coupons of bonds issued under the trust deed to these
respondents have presented for payment, but they allege that
it is immaterial whether one or more of said coupons have
been so presented; that inasmuch as the said coupons have not
been paid, and a large amount thereof as hereinbefore stated
have long since become due and payable, and these respondents have been by some of the holders of said coupons called
upon as trustees to foreclose the said mortgage, they are thereby
vested with full authority to proceed to such foreclosure."
An exhibit is filed with the amended bill, being a declaration, signed by Fosdick and Fish, as trustees, which, after
reciting the issue of the bonds of March 10, 1869, and the
mortgage given to them to secure the payment of the same,
and the provision thereof, that the principal should become
due, in case of the specified default in the payment of interest,
continues as follows: "And whereas default has been made by said company in
the payment of the half-year's interest on all of said bonds
which fell due on the first day of October, A. D. 1873.
"And whereas the coupons for such interest have been presented and payment demanded, and whereas such default has
continued for more than six months after such demand, and
whereas the holders of said bonds have never consented thereto,
and in consequence thereof the principal of all of the said
bonds has become due and payable:
"Now, therefore, the said Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes
Railroad Company are hereby notified that we, William R.
Fosdick and James D. Fish, as trustees as aforesaid, and under
and by virtue of the provisions of said trust deed and the
authority conferred upon us thereby, do hereby declare the
principal of all of said bonds to be due and payable."
Service of this declaration and notice upon the railroad
company is acknowledged to have been made Feb. 26, 1875.
Upon the issues thus made by the pleadings, an order of
reference was made to a master to take testimony, and report
the same with his findings, and a large amount of evidence
taken before him is contained in the record.

64

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R.

Co. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

On June 24, 1876, the master filed his report. In it, he
reported, among other findings, that, on Oct. 1, 1873, the said
corporation did not pay any of the interest falling due on that
day on the issue of bonds dated March 10, 1869, or upon the
issue dated March 12, 1872; nor has the said corporation paid
any of the subsequent instalments on any of said $4,000,000
bonds falling due at either of the following-named days:
April 1, 1874, Oct. 1, 1874, April 1, 1875, Oct. 1, 1875,
and April 1, 1876; and that demand was duly made for the
payment of divers of such coupons on Oct. 1, 1873, and
one of such coupons was protested for such non-payment
more than six months prior to the institution of this action,
or the written notice of such trustees declaring the principal of such bonds to be due and payable, and there is,
consequently, now due to the divers holders of bonds dated
March 10, 1869, the sum of $3,505,500. This sum includes
the principal of the bonds of the issue of March 10, 1869,
the several coupons thereon of the dates mentioned, with interest to July 1, 1876, and the additional sum of $389,500,
being twelve and one-half per cent premium on the nominal
amount due for payment in gold, according to the stipulation
in the bonds and mortgage to that effect.
The master further reported that, as to all matters relating
to the funding scheme, referred to in the pleadings, and the
effect of the surrender of the funded coupons, and of the failure of the company to pay the coupons due Oct. 1, 1875, he
was not required to examine or report upon, and, therefore,
made no finding, nor as to any allegations of fraud set up in
the pleadings, no testimony having been taken before or submitted to him upon either matter.
The railroad company filed exceptions to this report, of which
the sixth is as follows: "For that whereas the said master has decided, and in his
said report stated, that on the twelfth day of October, 1873,
said company did not pay any of its interest falling due on
that day; that demand was duly made, and that one of said
coupons was duly protested for such non-payment more than
six months prior to the institution of this action, and to the
date of the written notice of the trustees, and, therefore, the

65

said master assumes, and so decides, that the principal and
interest of all of said bonds has become due; when the fact
is, as shown by the proof offered by the complainants and
intervening petitioners, that no coupon was protested until
the nineteenth day of December, A. D. 1874, less than three
months prior to the date of said notice, and the commencement
of this action, and there is no proof that there was ever any
other demand upon said company for the payment of said
coupons."

On the hearing, a decree was rendered, in which, among
other findings, it is declared: That the railroad company had paid all the coupons, on the
bonds both on the Illinois and Indiana Divisions, which fell
due April 1, 1873, and that none of the coupons which had
matured since that date had been paid;
That, under the two proposals of the company for funding,
there had been deposited coupons due Oct. 1, 1873, to April 1,
1875, inclusive, on all the $2,500,000 of Illinois Division bonds,
except $698,500 thereof, which coupons still remained in the
hands of Fosdick, as trustee under the agreements; that the
semi-annual interest upon the convertible bonds and certificates
of indebtedness, issued in exchange therefor, which fell due
Aug. 1, 1874, was paid in full, and that the instalment of interest thereon, which became due Feb. 1, 1875, was duly paid
by said company upon all of the same which were presented
for payment, which was the great bulk thereof, and that no
interest has been paid on any part of the same since that
time;
That no payment of interest had been made upon the
$698,500 of Illinois Division bonds, which had not been
funded, since payment of the coupon due April 1, 1873.
The decree then recites as follows: "That heretofore, and on
the twenty-sLxth day of February, A. D. 1875, the said complainants, as trustees under the said mortgage or trust deed-to
them, dated March 10th, 1869, did declare the principal of the
said twenty-five hundred Illinois Division bonds to be due and
payable by reason of the default of said railroad company in
the payment of certain of the coupons of said bonds which fell
due October 1st, 1873, payment of which had been duly deVOL. XV:.

[Sup. Ct.

manded, and the continuance of such default for more than six
months after such demand."
The decree then proceeds to declare that there is due and
owing from the railroad company to the complainants, as trustees under the mortgage deed of March 10, 1869, the several
sums of $87,500 in gold coin, for the coupons on the $2,500,000
of bonds secured thereby, falling due respectively semi-annually
from Oct. 1, 1873, to Oct. 1, 1876, inclusive, less the payments
made on account of the four coupons on the convertible bonds
and certificates of indebtedness, with interest on said sums at
the rate of six per cent per annum, and, as the decree reads:
"In the further sum of two million five hundred thousand dollars in gold coin, for the principal of the said Illinois Division
bonds so declared to be due as aforesaid, together with interest
thereon from and after the first day of October, A. D. 1876, at
the rate of seven per cent per annum in gold."
It was then "ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said
defendant, the Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company, pay, or cause to be paid, to the said complainants as trustees, for the holders of the said Illinois Division bonds and
coupons, the said several sums of money, with interest thereon,
as hereinbefore found to be due and owing, within twenty (20)
days from and after the entry of this decree, and in default
thereof, that all of the said railroad, premises, property, and
franchises described in the said trust deed, dated March 10th,
A. D. 1869, and hereinbefore described as the Illinois Division
of said railroad, &c., and all the right, title, interest, and equity
of redemption of the said Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes
Railroad Company therein, shall be sold as an entirety by
Henry W. Bishop, the master in chancery of this court, at
public auction, to the highest and best bidder for cash therefor,
payable as hereinafter provided, at the west door of the Republic Life Insurance Company Building, in the city of Chicago,
in the State of Illinois, after having first given notice of the
time and place and terms of sale, and a description of the property to be sold, by advertisement thereof in some public newspaper published in the city of Chicago for the space of thirty
days prior to such day of sale."
The decree also contains the usual declaration that a con-

Oct. 1882.]

67

veyance of the title to the property sold, after confirmation of
the sale, shall be a perpetual bar, in law and equity, against
every claim of the railroad company, or other person claiming
under it.
Under this decree a sale was had and reported to the court,
and confirmed by a subsequent decree, of the mortgaged property to F. W. Huidekoper, T. W. Shannon, and J. M. Denison,
for $1,450,000, and the purchase-money having been paid,
$362,500 in cash, and by the surrender of $2,328,000 of the
Illinois Division bonds, with the coupons and certificates of
indebtedness or convertible bonds thereto attached and belonging, a conveyance of the title to the mortgaged property was
made to the purchasers.
It is assigned for error upon the decree of foreclosure and
sale,
_Eirst, That the court below required from the mortgagor,
payment of the principal of the debt secured by the mortgage,
as then due, and on non-payment thereof, within twenty days,
that the mortgaged property should be sold; and,
Seeond, That it decreed foreclosure and sale on this condition,
without proof of the written request of the holders of the
majority of the bonds.
It is undeniable that at the date of the filing of the bill,
which was Feb. 27, 1875, the defendant, the Chicago, Danville,
and Vincennes Railroad Company, was in default for nonpayment of the coupons on 8698,500 of the issue of $2,500,000
of the Illinois Division bonds, which matured Oct. 1, 1873.
The holders of that amount of these bonds did not fund their
coupons, and none of them were paid. This failure on the part
of the mortgagor constituted a breach of one of the conditions
of the mortgage; and continuing for six months, entitled the
trustees under the fifth article to take possession of the mortgaged premises, on being so required by the holders of not less
than one-half the outstanding bonds, and collect the net income,
until the default should have been satisfied; or, to sell the
mortgaged premises under the power conferred by the sixth
article of the conditions. In the latter event, the mortgaged
premises would be sold as an entirety, free from the incumbrance of the mortgage, and the proceeds of the sale applied,

68

[Sup. Ct.

first, to the payment of the amount due and in arrears, and
then to the mortgage debt, not then due, and any surplus to
the mortgagor. But, inasmuch as by the terms of the first
article the conveyance is declared to be for the purpose of
securing the payment of the interest as well as the principal of
the bonds, and by the fourth article, the mortgagor's right
of possession terminates upon a default in the payment of
interest as well as principal, on any of the bonds, we are of
opinion that, independently of the provisions of the other
articles, the trustees, or on their failure to do so, any bondholder, on non-payment of any instalment of interest on any
bond, might file a bill for the enforcement of the security, by
the foreclosure of the mortgage and sale of the mortgaged
property. This right belongs to each bondholder separately,
and its exercise is not dependent upon the co-operation or consent of any others, or of the trustees. It is properly and strictly
enforceable by, and in the name of, the latter, but, if necessary,
may be prosecuted without and even against them. It follows
from the nature of the security, and arises upon its face, unless
restrained by its terms. And in case the proceeding results
finally in a sale of the mortgaged premises, the sale is made
free from the equity of redemption of the m~ortgagor, and all
holders of junior incumbrances, if made parties to the suit, and
is of the whole premises, when necessary to the payment of the
amount due, or when the property is not properly divisible; it
conveys a clear and absolute title, as against all parties to the
suit, or their privies, and the proceeds of the sale are distributed
after payment of the amount due, for non-payment of which
the sale was ordered, in satisfaction of the unpaid debt remaining, whether due or not. Oleott v. Bynum, 17 Wall. 44;
Burrowes v. Molloy, 2 Jo. & Lat. 521. This doctrine is
stated by this court in Howell v. Western Railroad Company,
94 U. S. 463, 466, where an authoritative rule of practice in
such cases is prescribed. "We are of opinion, then," say the
court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, "that there is -due from
the railroad company to plaintiff the amount of his overdue
and unpaid coupons. For this sum, whatever it may be, he has
a right to a decree nisi, according to the chancery practice, a decree which will ascertain the sum so due and give the corn-

Oct. 1882.]

Co. v. FOSDIOK.

69

pany a reasonable time to pay it, say ninety days or six months,
or until the next term of the court, in the discretion of that
court. If this sum is not paid, the court must then order a
sale of the molgaged property, with a foreclosure of all rights
subordipate to the mortgage, with directions to bring the purchase-money into court. If the case proceeds thus far, the
plaintiff will have a lien on the money thus paid into court, not
only for his overdue coupons, but for his principal debt, and it
must be provided for in the order distributing the proceeds of
the sale. If, however, the company shall pay the sum found
due in the decree nisi, no further proceeding can be had until
another default of interest or of the principal."
The decree nisi, mentioned in this extract, like that in a
suit against an infant, in which a day is given him to show
cause against it, after he attains full age, and like that, where
the bill is ordered to be taken pro confesso, is preliminary in
its nature, requiring a further order to complete it. According
to the practice of the English chancery, a decree of this nature
in a foreclosure suit, after directing an account to be taken of
the principal and interest due to the complainant upon the
mortgage, orders, that upon the defendant's paying the amount
ascertained and certified or found to be due, within six months,
at such time and place as are appointed, the complainant shall
reconvey the mortgaged premises; but that in default of such
payment, the defendant shall thenceforth be absolutely debarred and foreclosed of his equity of redemption. It is necessary, however, for the complainant, in order to complete his
title, to procure a final order confirming it; otherwise the
decree of foreclosure will not be pleadable. This order of confirmation is procured on proof to the court of non-payment
according to the terms of the decree. 2 Daniell, Ch.Pr. 997.
The time usually allowed by the decree to pay the mortgage
debt, whether on a bill to redeem or to foreclose, was six
months. But that was not regarded as an absolutely fixed
period, but might be varied so as to be reasonable, according
to the discretion of the court and the particular circumstances
of the case. The courts, however, were very liberal in cases of
foreclosure, in extending and enlarging, from time to time, this
period of redemption, though not in cases of bills to redeem,

70

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co.

v.

FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

where the mortgagor came into court professing his readiness
to pay the amount due, when ascertained, nor in cases of sales,
where the mortgagor was not subjected to the severe and absolute forfeiture of his right. Perine v. Dunn, 4'Johns. (N. Y.)
Oh. 140; Harkins v. Forsyth, 11 Leigh (Va.), 294.
Where, according to the English practice, a sale, instead of
foreclosure, was ordered, the form of the decree was the same,
directing the sale, in the event of a default being made in payment of the amount found due, within the usual time of six
months, or within a shorter period, or even immediately, if by
consent, or where it was considered to be for the benefit of all
parties. 2 Daniell, Ch. Pr. 1266.
In the early practice in Kentucky, the preliminary decree,
finding the amount due and giving day for payment, was interlocutory merely and separate from the subsequent decree, finding the default in not performing the former decree and
directing a sale in consequence thereof. Downing v. Pabnateer,
1 Mon. (Ky.) 64; Oldham v. Halley, 2 J. J. Marsh. (Ky.)
113 ; Hancs v. Greenwade, 5 id. 250 ; Champlin v. Foster,7 B.
Mon. (Ky.) 104. The ground of this practice seems to have
been, that the mortgagor had the right to have the record show
that he had failed to pay according to the decree nisi before a
sale of his property was ordered. But there seems to us to be
no sufficient reason why, as it was according to the English
practice, and generally in this country, all these matters may
not be embraced in a single decree. What is indispensable
in such a decree is, that there should be declared the fact,
nature, and extent of the default which constituted the breach
of the condition of the mortgage, and which justified the complainant in filing his bill to foreclose it, and the amount due on
account thereof, which, with any further sums subsequently
accruing and having become due, according to the terms of the
security, the mortgagor is required to pay, within a reasonable
time, to be fixed by the court, and which, if not paid, a sale of
W~oodard v. Fitzpatrick,
the mortgaged premises is directed.
2 id. 61.
This is that final decree of foreclosure and sale, which determines and fixes the rights of the parties, and from which, on
that account, an appeal lies. Bay v. Law, 3 Crancb, 179;

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R.

Co. v.

FOSDICK.

71

WThiting v. Bank of the United States, 13 Pet. 6; Forgay v.
Conrad, 6 How. 201; Railroad Company v. Swasey, 23 Wall.
405.
But as in cases of strict foreclosure, so in cases of sale, the
equity of the mortgagor as against the mortgagee is not exhausted until sale actually confirmed; for if at any time prior
he should bring into court, for the mortgagee, the amount of
the debt, interest and costs, he will be allowed to redeem.
It is the deed made to the purchaser, actually transferring
the title of the parties to the suit, that terminates the mortgagor's equity of redemption. Brine v. Insurance Company, 96
U. S. 627.
It is obvious that the finding of the amount due, for nonpayment of which, according to the terms of the decree, the
mortgaged property is ordered to be sold, is the foundation
of the right of the mortgagee further to proceed, and a substantial error in that finding must, on appeal, vitiate all subsequent proceedings. Unlike a calculable error in the amount
of a personal judgment which may be cured by a remittitur, it
is otherwise incurable; for, as it is an illegal exaction, made as
a condition for preserving the rights of the mortgagor in his
estate, and, if executed, depriving him wrongfully of them, it
propagates itself through all subsequent stages of the cause.
The right to redeem is a favorite equity, and will not be taken
away, except upon a strict compliance with the steps necessary
to divest it. Bigler v. Waller, 14 Wall. 297; Shillaber v.
Robinson, 97 U. S. 68. In Clark v. Ieyburn, 8 Wall. 318, a
decree of strict foreclosure, which contained no finding, either
of the fact or amount of the alleged indebtedness, and gave no
time within which to pay or redeem, was reversed on these
grounds, although the bill was taken pro confesso as to the parties
having the entire beneficial interest, and contained an averment
of the precise amount of the mortgage debt then due. The
same consequences undoubtedly would have followed, if it had
been a decree of foreclosure and sale, instead of a strict foreclosure; and the error is as vital where a larger amount than
is actually due is ordered to be paid, as where there is a failure
to find what amount is due.
It becomes, then, of the first importance to ascertain whether

72

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES

R.R. CO. V. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

the decree of foreclosure and sale, in the present case, found
due and required to be paid, as the condition of exercising the
right to redeem, a larger sum than was then due.
The errors alleged in the amount are two. The first is, that
there was declared to be payable $252,220, the amount of the
several coupons, maturing from Oct. 1, 1873, to April 1, 1875,
both inclusive, the payment of which, it is claimed, as to all
the bonds of the Illinois Division, except $698,500 thereof, had
been, by the funding agreements, extended until Feb. 1, 1879.
The second is, that the principal sum of $2,500,000 of these
bonds, contrary to the agreement between the parties, was also
declared to be due and payable. The appellants insist that the
only indebtedness of the railroad company to the bondholders,
represented by the complainants at the time of the filing of
their bill, was the past-due interest on six hundred and ninetynine bonds, the interest warrants of which had not been
funded, amounting to about the sum of $147,000.
It appears from a statement in the record, admitted to be
correct, that there had been deposited and exchanged for convertible bonds the four coupons maturing on and from Oct. 1,
1873, to April 1, 1875, on $271,500 of the Illinois Division
bonds, and that by the terms of the agreement under which
that exchange was effected, dated Nov. 11, 1873, it was not to
be binding unless assented to in writing by a majority in interest of the bondholders. In point of fact, such majority
did not assent to it; but under the second proposition, dated
Nov. 20, 1873, the four corresponding coupons on $1,530,000
of the bonds, were deposited and exchanged for certificates of
indebtedness.
It appears further that the railroad company paid the accruing
interest on the convertible bonds and certificates of indebtedness, issued under these arrangements, which became due prior
to the filing of the bill, except $3,167.77, which was not presented. The default in respect to the coupons surrendered was,
by the terms of the funding agreements, waived as long as the
interest upon the securities substituted for them was punctually
paid, so that at the date of the filing of the bill there was no
subsisting default in the payment of interest, except upon the
$698,500 of bonds which had not been funded.

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES

R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

73

The master finds - and his report in that respect is the predicate of the decree - that divers coupons falling due Oct. 1,
1873, were presented on that day, and that payment thereof
was demanded and refused, and that one of such coupons was
protested for such non-payment more than six months prior to
the institution of the suit, and the written declaration of the
trustees, that the principal of the bonds had thereby become
due.
There are some statements in the answers, and in the testimony of some of the witnesses, that coupons due Oct. 1, 1873,
were presented for payment and were not paid; but there is no
proof of the fact as to any particular coupon identified for that
purpose, and we have carefully searched the record in vain for
any evidence whatever that any coupon, not afterwards funded,
was presented and payment thereof refused. The master himself does not report any such. It is entirely consistent with
his finding, and with the evidence on which it professes to be
founded, that the payment of every coupon falling due Oct. 1,
1873, presented for payment on or after that day, and payment whereof was refused, was extended by the subsequent
agreements to fund them. The intervening petition of Osgood
and others, if it be considered as a pleading whereby they were
allowed to become co-complainants, does not allege that any
one of the coupons held by them was presented for payment.
It is averred that large numbers of the coupons maturing on
Oct. 1, 1873, were presented, and payment thereof was demanded and refused on that day, but the allegation that any
such coupon was held by either of the petitioners seems to have
been studiously avoided; and stress is laid on averments of
fraudulent misrepresentations which induced bondholders to
fund their coupons, in support of which the master reported
that no testimony was offered, and upon the insolvency of the
company, which is entirely immaterial upon the question of an
actual default. It is averred in the petition that coupons were
presented and payment demanded in December, 1874, which
had become due the previous April, and the master so reports
as to one; but the only evidence that appears in the record is
an admission of the railroad company in its sixth exception to
the master's report, where it is accompanied by the statement

74

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES

R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct

that such demand and refusal was less than six months before
the filing of the bill, and could not, therefore, have been the
foundation of the declaration that the principal of the mortgage
debt had become payable, which, in fact, was not predicated
upon that default, but rested solely on the non-payment of the
coupons due Oct. 1, 1873.
There is nothing in the record to show that any one of the
bondholders, who had funded his coupons, claimed the right to
rescind the funding agreements, or that any step to do so had
been taken or authorized.
It is true that after the filing of the bill, and the appointment of a receiver, the company ceased to pay interest upon
its securities. That was but the natural consequence of the
litigation; and in taking a decree for foreclosure and sale, it
might have been in strict accordance with the equitable rights
of bondholders who had funded their coupons, to have rescinded the funding agreements, as incapable of execution.
But the legal effect of this would have been merely to find as
the true amount of the mortgage debt then due, necessary to be
paid to avoid a sale, the whole amount of interest unpaid on
all the coupons. It would not, however, have put the company in default as to the funded coupons from the beginning,
nor deprived it of the benefit of the waiver of that default,
arising from the fact of funding. It would have cancelled the
arrangement only as and from the date of the decree itself,
without impairing its antecedent effect by retroaction. It is
true, that where a mortgage has been given to secure a debt
payable in instalments, and a bill has been filed for foreclosure
and sale, upon a default as to one, the decree may require
payment of all instalments then due, though maturing since
the institution of the suit ; but that principle does not suffice
to bring the case of the appellees within the meaning of the
eighth article of the conditions of the mortgage, so as to justify
the decree requiring payment of the principal of the debt, as
presently due. For by the terms of that provision the entire
debt does not become absolutely due, on the default of the
company, continued for six months, without the consent of the
holder, to pay an interest coupon; but only at the election of
the trustees, as declared by them and notified to the mortgagor.

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

75

And the forfeiture of the time of payment to be established in
a given case must stand or fall upon the fact of such declaration and notice, as it may be justified or not by the circumstances existing when they were made. It cannot be supported
by subsequent occurrences. It follows, therefore, that the
claim in support of the finding that the whole debt had become
due must rest exclusively upon the alleged default of Oct. 1,
1873, and that, as we have seen, is not sufficient.
It does not affect this conclusion, that by the terms of the
sixth article of the conditions of the mortgage it is provided
that upon the exercise of the power thereby conferred, resulting in a sale of the mortgaged premises, for a single default in
the payment of interest (it may be one coupon merely), the
property is to be sold as an entirety, and free of the incumbrance of the mortgage, so as to pass all the title, both of
mortgagor and mortgagee, and that the proceeds of the sale
are to be applied, after payment of overdue interest, to the
payment of the principal of the debt, though not yet due.
This provision does not, either in terms or in effect, make the
whole debt due before the stipulated day of payment. It is
simply the application to the case of a sale by the trustees
under the power, of the practice of courts of equity in cases
of judicial sales upon foreclosure. In either case the right of
the mortgagee to redeem, and thus prevent the sale, is preserved, on payment, not of the unmatured principal sum of
the debt, but merely of the interest then actually due and in
arrears, - the very right which, by the decree now in question,
was denied. If authority is needed on such a proposition, it
will be found in Holden v. Gibiert, 7 Paige (N. Y.), 208, and
Olcott v. Bynum, 17 Wall. 44.
This right cannot be regarded as other than important and
valuable. Its denial in the present case was a substantial and
serious wrong. This is manifest from the bare statement that
the decree required payment, within twenty days, of $2,500,000,
which we find was not due, as a condition of preventing the
sale of property, which, it is admitted, was worth more than
this debt, and which, according to the testimony in the case,
was earning more than enough to pay the current interest on
this mortgage. The receiver states the net earnings for the

76

[Sup. Ct.

year 1874 at $330,615.75, and adds, speaking July 31, 1875,
that " the present year, like the preceding, is of almost unexampled depression in most branches of business upon which
the consumption of coal depends," the transportation of which
was the main traffic of the road; and adds that he believes,
on the reasons he states, that " it is practicable, in a year of
fair prosperity, to increase the earnings from fifty to eighty
per cent over those of 1874." Upon such a showing, it is
immaterial to say that the railroad company was commercially
insolvent, not being able to pay all its obligations as they
matured; for the fact, if admitted, would not affect its legal
or equitable rights, much less be allowed to deprive its other
creditors, junior incumbrancers and lienholders, of their right
to prevent a sale and sacrifice of the property by paying the
comparatively small amount of the interest, justly due, upon
the first-mortgage bonds, and thus preserving their own estates
and interests as well as those of the mortgagor.
The second assignment of error which we have noted is, in
our opinion, also well founded.
The eighth article of the conditions of the mortgage, which
relates to this subject, contains the provision that, after the
principal of the bonds has been declared by the trustees to
have become due, by reason of the default therein described,
and the mortgagor notified thereof, the trustees, "upon the
written request of the holders of a majority of the said bonds
then outstanding, shall proceed to collect both principal and
interest of all such bonds outstanding, by foreclosure and sale
of said property, or otherwise, as herein provided."
It is contended on behalf of the appellees, that without the
last clause the trustees have the sole right to act, according to
their discretion and upon their own motion, in declaring the
principal sum due on account of the default; and that upon
such declaration and notice by the trustees the whole sum
becomes due irrevocably for all the purposes of the mortgage;
so that thereafter the trustees, at their option, may file a bill
for foreclosure and sale, or may intervene, in case such a bill is
filed by any bondholder, and thereupon the amount decreed
must be the amount thus declared to be, and hence, actually
due; and that the office of the clause in reference to the

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

77

written request of a majority of the bondholders is merely to
make the obligation of the trustees imperative, instead of
optional.
We cannot agree to that construction of the provision. The
whole article must be taken together. It is, in fact, a unit,
and is directed to a single end. And the nature of the provision and the character of its object must be taken into consideration as furnishing the rule of its interpretation. It is an
agreement which the parties were at liberty to make. There
is nothing in it illegal or contrary to public policy. And
while it is in the nature of a forfeiture, it is one against which,
when it has taken place according to the fair meaning of the
parties, courts of equity will not relieve. It was so held in
Noyes v. Clark, 7 Paige (N. Y.), 179; Noonan v. Lee, 2 Black,
499; Olcott v. Biynum, 17 Wall. 44.
The stipulation, nevertheless, is in the nature of a penalty,
and may be regarded as strictijuris, to be construed fairly and
reasonably, according to the meaning of the parties, but leaning, if need be, in any case of ambiguity, in favor of the
debtor. And the construction, in the present instance at least,
which favors him, does not discriminate against the bondholders as a class, but rather between the interests of the
whole number, represented by the trustees and controlled by
a majority, and those of a single creditor, or a minority, associated in the like case, pursuing their remedy as individuals.
For while, as we have seen, one or any number of bondholders
may prosecute a bill to foreclose the mortgage, upon default as
to payment of a single coupon, or the trustees may intervene
on behalf of all for the same purpose, because the failure to
pay a single instalment of interest is made a breach of the
condition of the mortgage; yet it is apparent that one purpose
at least of the clause in question was to protect the bondholders as a class against the views of individuals and combinations of individuals, being a minority, pursuing separate
interests.
In declaring the principal sum due before the date fixed by
the credit, upon a default in the payment of interest, the trustee is acting for the whole number of bondholders, and the
provision that subjects his action in enforcing the stipulation

78

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R.

Co. v.

FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

to the wishes of a majority is meant, as we think, for the protection of the class. Many cases may be mentioned to illustrate
the importance in their interests of such a control, rather than
to put it in the power of one or a minority to require all to
accept what the majority might consider to be a premature and
less valuable satisfaction for their existing security. The larger
number might think it to their advantage even to defer the collection of their overdue interest, much less not to anticipate the
payment of the principal, even when the security was ample
to meet both; for they might esteem the ultimate investment
higher than present payment. While they could not and ought
not to prevent others, even a single individual, from exacting
the promptest payment of what is due and may be important
as current income, by legal process, they may nevertheless
rightfully object tp an anticipation of payment that may, in
their opinion, prove to be a sacrifice. And this becomes
especially important when the present value of the security is
insufficient to prepay the incumbrance, but contains the solid
promise of future indemnity as an investment. It is that interest we think, that dictated the clause in question, and can be
satisfied only by the construction which secures to the majority
of the bondholders the right to veto the proceeding of the
trustees.
Indeed, the other construction contended for, which gives to
the majority only the right to make the obligation of the trustees to proceed, imperative, renders it nugatory. For upon
that supposition, the debt having become fully due, by the
declaration and notice of the trustees, for all the purposes of
the mortgage, if they should delay or refuse to file a bill for
foreclosure and sale, it would still be in the power of a single
bondholder to proceed for himself and associates directly for
the same object, and to procure the same relief.
It is therefore our opinion that, even had the trustees rightfully declared the principal sum of the mortgage debt due, and
given the proper notice thereof, nevertheless, the foundation
for proceeding to foreclose for that cause, and of the decree
requiring payment of that amount, would fail, without proof
that the bill had been filed for that purpose, upon the written
request of the holders of a majority of the bonds then out-

standing. It is not disputed that no such proof is to be found
in this record.
Other errors than those already discussed have been assigned
upon both appeals, which, as in the further progress of the
cause they may not arise again, we have not considered and do
not therefore pass upon.
For the reasons already given, both decrees will be reversed,
and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed in con,
formity with this opinion.
So ordered
with whom concurred MR,
dissenting.
I am unable to agree to the judgment in this case. In my
opinion default had been made in the payment of the interest
on some of the bonds, within the meaning of the eighth clause
of the mortgage. The company having given notice that the
coupons due Oct. 1, 1873, would not be paid if presented,
no presentation was necessary in order to create the default.
This notice was a waiver of a presentation in form. Couponholders were in effect told it was useless to make a demand,
because if made it would not be met. Confessedly this default
as to the coupons on 8698,000 of the bonds continued more
than six months. Holders of bonds to this amount declined to
enter into the scheme for extension. They kept their coupons,
hoping some plan might be devised for payment, but retaining
all their rights under the mortgage, if their hopes were not
realized.
This default having happened, and having continued more
than six months without the consent of the holders of the
coupons, by the express terms of the eighth clause, the principal of all the bonds secured by the mortgage became immediately due and payable. If after that the holders of a majority
of the outstanding bonds had requested the trustees in writing
to foreclose the mortgage, it would have become the imperative
duty of the trustees to institute the necessary proceedings for
that purpose. But if no such request was made, it seems to
me that the trustees were not precluded from commencing such
proceedings on their own motion, in case the safety of the trust

JUSTICE HALA.,

[Sup. Ct.

made it necessary. It is possible, if a majority of the bondholders had, in an appropriate way, interfered to prevent the
trustees from going on, some relief might have been afforded
them; but when all came in and availed themselves of what
had been done, the corporation was in no position to defend,
because a request had not been formally made in advance. As
to the corporation, the principal of the bonds became due and
payable when a default occurred which continued the requisite
length of time. Whether a foreclosure should be had because
of the default, rested alone with the bondholders and trustees.
The provision in the mortgage for the written request was, as
it seems to me, not for the protection of the company, but the
bondholders. If the bondholders are satisfied with what the trustees have done, the corporation is in no condition to complain.
That the trustees were justified in commencing proceedings
on their own motions seems to me clear. Some of the bondholders, having coupons and bonds, as to which default had
been made, began a suit for foreclosure in a state court, and
secured the appointment of a receiver. The company was very
much embarrassed financially, and, so long as the receivership
continued, could do nothing to extricate itself from its difficulties. It was a necessity, therefore, for the trustees to interfere. When they did, the company did not relieve itself from
the consequences of its default in the payment of coupons on
the $698,000 of bonds. All the bondholders seem to have been
satisfied with what was done, and they united with the trustees
in pressing the foreclosure.
Under these circumstances, in my opinion, the court properly
treated the principal of all the bonds as due, and decreed
accordingly.
These cases were decided at the last term, before the appointment of MR. JUSTICE GRAY and MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD.
A petition for a rehearing in the second case was then filed.
They took no part in the subsequent action of the court.
MR. JUSTICE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the court.

Since the announcement of our former opinion, the appellees,
having filed a petition for rehearing, have suggested that the

decree brought up by the appeal in the second case is not, what
it is recited to be, in the prayer for appeal in the Circuit Court,
viz. the decree confirming the sale of the mortgaged property
under that of foreclosure and sale,-but one rendered subsequently thereto, and merely in execution of it, and that it is,
therefore, not the subject of an appeal, and claim that the
present appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
The appeal prayed for and allowed in the Circuit Court is
recited in the petition therefor filed March 26, 1879, to be as
follows: "From the decree entered April 12, 1877, confirming the
report of the sale of the property of the defendant railroad
company.
"From the decree of April 16, 1877, ordering the delivery
of the deed and possession of the property to the purchasers,
Frederick W. Huidekoper, Thomas W. Shannon, and John M.
Dennison.
"From the decree entered in said cause on the nineteenth
day of November, 1877, in favor of Frederick W. Huidekoper,
Thomas W. Shannon, and John M. Dennison, and against the
said Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad Company, for
the sum of $1,808,646.46."
The two decrees last named, of April 16, 1877, and of Nov.
19, 1877, do not appear in the record.
An examination of the terms of the decree of April 12,"
1877, shows that it is a decree, confirming the report of the
master, upon a petition of the purchasers, Huidekoper, Shannon, and Dennison, asking that their bid may be satisfied by a
surrender of bonds and coupons without further cash payment,
and, upon that surrender, for a conveyance of the title to the
property, and to be let into possession. What prior action of
the court, upon a report of the sale, had taken place, the transcript of the record before us does not disclose. Counsel for
the appellees state that there was in fact a prior decree, confirming the sale, rendered on Feb. 26, 1877, from which no
appeal was perfected, and produce in support of their statement
what is called a supplemental transcript of the record, containing such a decree. This, however, we cannot at present consider or act upon, further than to say that, in view of the
VOL. XVI

[Sup. Ct.

suggestions made, and to enable the parties to present whatever questions arise upon the record as it is now before us, or
upon a complete record, when supplied, upon the appeal prayed
for and perfected on March 26, 1879, the application for a
rehearing is granted; and the decree of this court rendered at
the present term, so far only as it reverses any of the decrees
embraced in this appeal, is to that extent and foi that purpose
set aside.
At the present term the case was argued by fr. Edwin
Walker and Vr. B. Biddle Roberts for the appellants, and by
Mr. Henry Crawford, Mr. Charles B. Lawrence, and Mr. Melville W. Fuller for the appellees.
MR. JUsTIC,

MA±H2ws delivered the opinion of the

court.
This appeal, heard during the last term with that from the
decree of foreclosure and sale in the same case, was taken from
three decrees rendered after the sale had taken place. Huidekoper, Shannon, and Dennison, the purchasers of the mortgaged property sold under the decree of foreclosure, who are
appellees in this appeal, were not parties to the former appeal.
All the decrees appealed from, including those now in question, were included in the order of reversal made at the former
hearing; but on a petition for rehearing, it was called to the
attention of the court that the transcript of the record was
imperfect and incomplete, the decree confirming the sale having been omitted, and that the petition for the present appeal
contained a misrecital, that the decree entered April 12, 1877,
was the decree "confirming the report of the sale of the property of the defendant railroad company." The order of reversal was, therefore, set aside as to the decrees embraced in
the present appeal, and a rehearing granted. The cause, on
that rehearing, has now been heard at the present term upon
the whole record, as amended and perfected.
From that it now appears that on Feb. 17, 1877, the master
filed his report of the sale, and the purchasers, their petition
for its confirmation, and for other relief; and it was on that
day, on motion of the complainants' solicitors, ordered that the

Oct. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

83

report and sale be confirmed, unless objections thereto should be
filed on or before the Friday next following, for which day it
was set for hearing. And exceptions having been in the mean
time filed by one Slaughter, on Feb. 26, 1877, the court overruled the exceptions, and as the order reads, "does in all things
confirm the sale" to the purchasers. From this decree an appeal was prayed by Slaughter, but was not perfected or prosecuted. The petition of the purchasers, filed Feb. 17, 1877, in
which they also asked for the immediate discharge and payment
of their bid, had been referred to the master, whose report subsequently filed was confirmed by the decretal order of April
12, 1877, by which he was directed, on the surrender to him of
two thousand three hundred and twenty-eight first-mortgage
Illinois Division bonds of the defendant railroad company, to
execute and deliver to the purchasers a deed of the property
sold, and thereupon the receiver was directed to let them into
possession. On April 16, 1877, the master having reported
the execution of the. decree of April 12 by the delivery of the
deed and the acceptance of the bonds, a further decree was
entered approving and confirming the same. These are the
two decrees first named in the prayer for the present appeal.
It is now contended by the appellees that these decrees are
merely orders in execution of the previous decrees of the court;
are, therefore, not final in the sense necessary to authorize an
appeal; and that consequently, as to them, the present appeal
must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
But according to the rule sanctioned and adopted in Forgay
v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, and Blossom v. Bailroad Company,
1 Wall. 655, an appeal will lie from such decrees, according
to the nature of their subject-matter and the rights of the
parties affected.
In the present case the decree of April 12, 1877, in effect,
distributes the proceeds of the sale upon the basis of the finding
and declaration in the decree for foreclosure, that the principal
of the bonds had become overdue; for it authorized the purchasers, to the extent of the proportion in which the bid, if
treated as cash, would, when applied, extinguish the bonds held
by them to use their bonds as cash in payment of their bid.
It is manifest that a substantial error, to the prejudice of one

84

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co. v. FOSDICK.

[Sup. Ct.

of the parties, may originate in a decree distributing the proceeds of a sale under a decree of foreclosure; and no question
can be successfully raised against the right to appeal from such
a decree. We cannot, therefore, dismiss the present appeal
upon the ground alleged.
It is then urged by the appellees that the decrees in question, having simply followed the directions of previous decrees,
originated no error, and that the only alternative is to affirm
them. But the decrees involved in this appeal now under consideration are dependent upon the decree of foreclosure and
sale; and the latter having been reversed, the decrees in question are left without support, and fall of themselves, by reason
of that reversal, vitiated by the common error. As they are
already annulled by operation of law, the subject-matter of the
appeal is withdrawn, and the appeal itself must be dismissed
for lack of anything on which it can operate.
The other decree involved in this appeal was entered Nov.
19, 1877, and is a personal judgment in favor of Huidekoper,
Shannon, and Dennison, as trustees for themselves and other
bondholders, for the deficiency arising from the excess of the
amount found due by the decree of foreclosure and sale over
the credit, given of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged
property. This deficiency is ascertained to be $1,823,573.84,
and execution is awarded therefor, against the railroad company,
in favor of the above-named parties.
It would seem that the reasons given for dismissing the
appeal as to the other decrees apply with equal force to the
one now under consideration; and such, we think, would be
the rule in ordinary cases; for the existence and amount of
the deficiency must usually be dependent on the findings of the
decree of foreclosure and sale, as to the amount due, and the
extent to which that may have been reduced by the proceeds
of the sale. But the present judgment is not in the customary
form. Instead of finding the amount due to the complainants
in whose behalf the sale was decreed, the judgment is rendered
in favor of Huidekoper, Shannon, and Dennison, as trustees for
the bondholders. They claim not to have been parties to the
suit at the time the decree of foreclosure and sale was rendered;
and as we do not consider it proper to investigate or pass upon

0a. 1882.]

CHICAGO AND VINCENNES R.R. Co.

v.

FOSDICK.

85

Ihat claim in the present proceeding, we entertain the appeal,
as to the deficiency decree, and reverse it, for the error which
required the reversal of the decree of foreclosure and sale.
The argument of the present appeal, on both sides, seems to
have been influenced by the consideration that it possibly involved a present adjudication of the effect its determination
might have upon the rights of the purchasers at the sale and
the present title of the property sold. But no question of that
character is involved. Whether the purchasers were parties
to the litigation, either by name upon the record or in interest
and by representation, so as to be affected by the error in the
proceeding for which the decrees have been reversed, or whether
they or their assigns are protected by the principle and policy
that uphold the titles of bona fide purchasers without notice,
at judicial sales, and any other that may be mooted touching
the point, are questions which do not arise upon the present
appeal, and are left for further consideration in case they should
be presented in a subsequent stage of this or by virtue of proceedings in some other suit.
For the reasons announced, it is, therefore, ordered that the
appeal from the decrees of April 12, 1877, and of April 16,
1877, respectively, be dismissed, upon the ground that the decrees were vacated by the reversal of the prior decree of foreclosure and sale, rendered Dec. 5, 1876, and that the decree
entered Nov. 19, 1877, in favor of Frederick W. Huidekoper,
Thomas W. Shannon, and John M. Dennison, trustees, be
reversed, and that the cause be remanded with directions to
proceed therein as may be just and equitable.
The appellants are entitled to their costs on this appeal.
