MR. JUSTICE BLATOHFOrD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action at law, brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, on the
26th of September, 1885, by Sarah May against the county of
Fond du Lac, a corporation of the State of Wisconsin, to
recover damages for the infringement of letters patent No.
25,662, granted to Edwin May, October 4, 1859, for fourteen
years from that day, for an "improvement in the construction
of prisons."
The specification and claims of the patent are as follows:
"Be it known that I, Edwin May, of Indianapolis, in the
county of Marion and State of Indiana, have invented certain
new and useful improvements in the construction and operation of prisons, of which the following is a full and exact
description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings and the letters marked thereon. Figure 1 is a perspective
and figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are sectional views showing the
construction and general arrangement of the same.
"A represents the side and end walls of the prison; B, the
floor; C, the outside door; D, inside or angle door; E, mould-

ing or hood over door 0; F, the cells; G, the small door of
the safe or box J; H, the crank which operates the drum (p);
I, bolt or lock to the angle door D; a, a bar connected with
the bolts S, which are operated by the levers (b)for the purpose of fastening the cell doors (J); c, fulcrum of the lever (b);
d, levers for operating the sliding doors (); e, wire rope or
endless chain which operates the levers (d); f, hinge joints to
levers (d); g, support of pulleys for chain or wire rope; h, pulleys over which the chain or wire rope (e)
operates; i, the
grated partition; j, cell doors; k, slide or groove for doors (0
to work in; m, rollers for sliding doors (); n, guard or slide
for levers (d); o, staple to padlock levers (b); q, pawl or catch
to hold the drum (p) in place; r, rollers for bar (d) to work
over.
"The nature and extent of the improvement will be more
readily understood by reference to the object sought, which is,
avoiding the necessity of actual contact with the prisoners,
while the keeper has perfect knowledge and control of them,
and preventing their escape by knocking down the keeper,
which has often occurred where the common arrangement of
prisons has been used. It is peculiarly adapted to county
prisons and that portion of State prisons appropriated to solitary confinement.
"The following is the manner of operating the same and
managing the prisoners: The jailer, opening the outside door
0, releases the edge of the small or safe door G, giving access
to the crank H, which operates the doors (1)in the grated partition (i) by means of the endless chain or rope which passes
around the drum (p) and is attached to the hinge or joint (f)
of the lever (d). The angle door D is held by the bolt or lock
I while the keeper is allowed to examine every part of the
hall, which the peculiar shape of the angle door D allows.
Should there be any prisoners in the first hall they are ordered
to retire through the doors (O)'in the grated partition (i). The
doors () are then closed by operating the crank .U,as has been
shown. The keeper then, unlocking, passes through the angle
door D into the first ball, being separated from the prisoners
by the grating (z), through which he orders the prisoners each

Opinion of the Court.

to his cell, and to close the door after him. By operating the
lever (b) the bars (a) are drawn, while the bolts S, being drawn
over the doors, secure the same. He then passes in and locks
the doors (j), whereby an iron grating is always kept between
the keeper and the prisoners.
"What I claim and desire to secure by letters patent is "First. The angle door D, in combination with the safe
lock or bolt I, when constructed and operated substantially as
set forth.
"Second. The safe J, containing the drum (p) and bolt I,
and being held by the' outer door 0, when constructed and
operated substantially as and for the purposes set forth.
"Third. The endless chain or rope (e), in combination with
the levers (c), when constructed and operated substantially as
and for the purposes set forth.
"Fourth. The combination and arrangement of the levers (b),
bar (a), and bolts or lugs S, when operated from without the
grating i, substantially as and for the purposes set forth."
The patent was, on the 4th of October, 1873, extended by
the Commissioner of Patents for seven years from that day.
The patentee, who was the husband of the plaintiff, died on
the 27th of February, 1880. The plaintiff claimed that one
Edwin Forrest May, on the 6th of March, 1880, was duly
appointed executor of Edwin May by the proper tribunal;
that, he havingresigned his trust on the 7th of June, 1880,
one McGinnis was duly appointed administrator de bonos non,
with the will annexed, of Edwin May; and that McGinnis, on
the 6th of 'March, 1882, under a proper order of the proper
court to that effect, conveyed to the plaintiff all the title of
the estate of the patentee under the patent and its extension,
including all rights of action and claims for damages which
the estate had by virtue thereof. Damages were claimed for
the use of the patented invention, as covered by claims 1, 3
and 4, for the period of the eXtended term, from October
4, 1873, to October 4, 1880.
The defendant, by an answer and a notice of special matter,
set up in defence the statute of limitations of the State of
Wisconsin and want of novelty. The case was tried by a

jury, who found that during the extended term of the patent
the defendant bad infringed claims 1, 3 and 4; and they
awarded to the plaintiff $1774.68 damages. 27 Fed. Rep.
691. The defendant moved for a new trial on various
grounds, including one that the court erred in not instructing
the jury to render a verdict for the defendant, and another
that the court erred in ruling that the plaintiff was the owner
of the cause of action. This motion was denied; and the
defendant then moved for an arrest of judgment, on the
grounds (1) that the patent was void on its face, because none
of the claims were for a patentable invention or combination,
and that no one of the several combinations claimed in it as
the patentee's inventions was a new or patentable invention;
and (2) that the plaintiff was not the lawful owner of the 'cause
of action sued upon. This motion was overruled, and judgment
was entered for the plaintiff for $1774.68 and costs. To review
that judgment the defendant has brought a writ of error.
At the trial, when the patent was offered in evidence, it
was objected to by the defendant on the ground that, on the
face of the specification and claims, it was invalid. This
objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted. The
same objection was made to the certificate of extension, and
overruled and the defendant excepted. The proceedings for
the appointment of the executor and of the administrator do
bonis

non, and for the sale of the patent, the conveyance to

the plaintiff, and the order of the court confirming the sale
and conveyance, ivere then put in evidence under the objection and exception of the defendant that they did not vest in
the plaintiff any title to the cause of action sued on.
One Luther V. Moulton was then introduced as a witness
by the plaintiff, and testified as follows: "I live at Grand
Rapids, Michigan; am a partner in a foundry there; I have
had experience in mechanics and patents; have photographed
models; have been consulted about the patentability of mechanical devices; have been an expert witness in patent
causes; have done patent soliciting; am acquainted with the
May patent in suit; know its specifications and claims, and
am acquainted with its practical operation and effect."

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

It was contended that the defendant had infringed the
patent by constructing and using a county jail containing the
inventions covered by claims 1, 3 and 4. Models of a jail
constructed according to the patent, and of the defendant's
jail, were introduced in evidence by the plaintiff and identified
as correct. A stipulation was then put in evidence, signed by
the attorneys for the parties, to the effect that the device used
by the defendant in its jail for fastening the doors had been
in use therein since 1869. The witness Moulton then proceeded: "In my opinion the model representing the defendant's jail contains the mechanical equivalents of the devices
described in the specification, and claimed particularly in the
first, third and fourth claims of the patent in question. The
resulfs produced by the combinations claimed in the patent
are produced by substantially the same means." On crossexamination he testified as follows: "The novelty and utility
of this patented device consist in interposing a grating or
wall between the person operating the mechanism for securing
the doors and the prisoners, so that they can be observed
through'the door or grating and the corridor doors be closed
and secured, or unlocked and opened, or the cell doors can be
locked or unlocked, all without any contact between the jailer
and the prisoners, and without the jailer being in the same
apartment with the prisoners, and thus exposed to attack by
them. The several elements of the device are probably old.
The novelty consists in the particular combinations, whereby
a new and useful result is produced. I think an angle door is
old; have never seen them in jails; have seen angle doors and
curved doors and illustrations of them in books many years
ago, before 1859. Locks and bolts upon doors are also old,
and to put a lock or bolt upon such a door would not be invention. In defendant's jail, the corridor doors are not closed
by the fastening mechanism as described in the patent, but,
when closed by the prisoners or turnkey, they are locked by
bolts moved by rock-shafts extending from the outer apartment, through the wall, into the jail proper and to the corridor
doors. There is nothing new in a rock-shaft as applied to the
purpose of transmitting motion to bolts or other like uses; it

FOND DU LAO COUNTY v. MAY.
Opinion of the Court.

is the equivalent of an endless chain, or any other well-known
device for transmitting motion; it is very old. The operation
and effect of the rock-shaft, the handle or lever that moves it,
and the bolts that it moves in connection with the corridor
doors thereby locked and unlocked, are precisely the same with
or without a wall or grating interposed between the handle
or lever and the door locked, and also the same as the corresponding parts in the May patent. In the Fond du Lao jail
the handle of this rock-shaft and the place where it is operated
are a few feet distant from the angle door. There is an embrasure or slit in the wall by these handles to the rock-shafts,
through which two corridors, one over the other on one side
of the jail, can be observed; but the other side of the jail
with its two corridors and two tiers of cells, cannot be
observed. The doors of all four corridors are locked by rockshafts, all starting and moved from the same point. The
operation and effect of the arrangement of the lever (b), bar
(a), and bolts or lugs (S), as described in the patent, for locking and unlocking the cell doors, are precisely the same
whether the lever is operated through a wall or grating, or
whether there is none there. Mechanically, the effect is precisely the same with or without the grating, so far as fastening
and unfastening the doors is concerned. The only difference
is in the effect of the grating to protect the jailer and guard
against escapes. Every separate element of the combination
of the fourth claim is old -the bar, the lever, the lugs or
bolts, and the grating. Levers have long been used, long
before this patent, to move a long bar and thereby to move
bolts, lugs, or the like, at a distance; so, also, similar devices
passing through a, wall, to open and close and secure window
shutters and the like; but the particular combination adapted
to interpose protection between the person operating the
device and those on the other-side of the wall or grating was
new and patentable, and so patented to Mr. Aay. The grating has nothing to do directly with locking or unlocking the
doors. It affords protection to the operator while so doing.
So with the second claim in suit, which is the third of the
patent. All its separate elements are old. It is only the parVOL. cxxxv-26

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.

ticular combination applied to this purpose that is new and
patentable."
The plaintiff then gave evidence to show that the patented
contrivance was useful and economical, and for much of the
time since it was patented had been in use in sundry jails
and prisons in this country. It was further proved that the
defendant had used in its jail, ever since 1869, the outside angle
door, the contrivanc6 for locking and unlocking the corridor
doors, and the contrivance for locking and unlocking the cell
doors, which were exhibited by the model of its jail which had
been put in evidence. Other evidence was given on the part
of the plaintiff, but none to contradict what had been testified
to by the witness Moulton; and at the close of the plaintiff's
case the defendant moved that a verdict be directed for it, on
the grounds, among others, that the patent was void for lack
of novelty, and that the combinations described in it were not
operative combinations, and were old and well-known devices
applied to similar uses. This motion was overruled, and the
defendant excepted.
Thereupon the defendant proved that at the Wisconsin State
prison at Waupun, the Chemung County jail at Elmira, New
York, and elsewhere, there had been in common and public
use, well known to many persons, for many years before 1859,
a device consisting of a lever, a bar, and lugs or bolts attached,
operated substantially as described in said patent, to lock or
unlock the cell doors, but without any intervening wall, corridor grating or other protection to the jailer against attack;
that such device, except for the absence of a corridor wall or
grating, was substantially identical with, and a mechanical
equivalent of, the device described in said patent, and claimed
in the fourth claim thereof, and that it was used, and operated
in the same way, to lock or unlock the cell doors after they
had been closed.
No evidence in rebuttal was offered by the plaintiff, and,
the testimony being'closed, the defendant renewed its motion
for a verdict to. be directed for it, on the grounds before stated;
but the motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.
The defendant then prayed that the jury be instructed that

FOND DU LAC COUNTY v. MAY.

403

Opinion of the Court.

each of the claims, 1, 3 and 4 was void ; that claim 1 did
not claim a new device, nor was the combination claimed
therein an operative combination, but was a mere aggregation; that claim 3 did not describe a new device; and that it
was a question for the jury whether there was an invention, or
exercise of the inventive faculty, in the construction of the
devices described in the patent. Each of these instructions
was refused, and the defendant excepted to each refusal. The
case was submitted to the jury under instructions from the
court, the defendant excepting thereto because the court did
not submit it to the jury to say whether the elements specified in each of the several combinations in claims 1, 3 and 4
appeared together in a practical combination, or whether it
was a mere aggregation.
We are of opinion that the court ought to have directed a
verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the patent was
void; and that the judgment must be reversed. The objects
sought to be accomplished by the patentee were twofold,safe observation of the prisoners while they were out of *their
cells but within the outer inclosure of the jail, and a safe mode
of locking them in their cells without risk of personal contact
with them. These objects he sought to attain by three contrivances, which are the foundations of the four claims of the
patent. Proceeding inwards from the outside of the jail, these
three contrivances are as follows: (1) An angle door D, with
the angle in the middle line of the door, projecting inward, a,
safe or box J, containing a drum (p) operated by a crank H,
and a bolt or lock I to the angle door D. This contrivance,
which is the subject of claim 1, enables the jailer, after he
opens the extreme outer door of the jail, to have access to the.
angle door, so as to look through its grated bars in all directions by means of the angle, while that door is securely held
by the bolt or lock I, and to inspect the interior of the prison
and observe the prisoners, and direct them to retire behind the
corridor or partition doors (0)in the grated partition (i). This
partition separates an outer hall or 'space from the corridors
which run along the tiers of cells. (2) When the prisoners
have thus retired behind the corridor or partition doors (l), the

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

next step is to open the safe or box J, from the space between
the outer door and the angle door, and by the crank H operate the drum (p), which carries the wire rope or endless chain
(e), which, by pulleys, levers and hinges, opens or shuts the
corridor or partition doors (t). Those doors being closed while
the jailer is still outside of the angle door, he can then open
the angle door and go into the inner hall. The mechanism
thus explained is the foundation of claims 2 and 3. (3) Then
the jailer, having between him and the prisoners the grated
partition (i), with the doors in it closed, can direct each prisoner to retire to his cell and to close the cell door after him.
The jailer then, by operating the lever (b), can draw the bars
(a) and carry the bolts or lugs S over the cell doors, and thus
secure them. He can then advance into the corridor and
further secure the cell doors by ordinary locks on them. This
mechanism is the foundation of claim 4.
The novel idea set forth in the patent is to interpose a grating between the jailer and the prisoners at every stage of
opening or shutting a door. Previously, there had been between the jailer and the prisoners no intervening wall, corridor
grating or other protection against attack; but, with that
exception, the prior device used in the Wisconsin State prison
and the Chemung County jail was substantially identical with,
and a mechanical equivalent of, the device claimed in claim 4
of the patent, and operated in the same way to fasten and
unfasten the cell doors.
The several elements of the patented device were old.
Moulton testified that he had seen angle doors and curved
doors, and illustrations of them in books, before 1859; that in
*the defendant's jail the corridor doors were not closed by the
fastening mechanism described in the patent, but, when closed
by the prisoners or the turnkey, were locked by bolts moved by
rock-shafts extending from the outer apartment, through the
wall, into the jail proper and to the corridor doors; that there
was nothikg new in a rock-shaft applied to the purpose of
transmitting motion to bolts or to other like uses; that it was
the equivalent of an endless chain or any other well-known
device for transmitting motion, and was very old; that the

FOND DU LAO COUNTY v. MAY.
Opinion of the Court.

operation and effect of the rock-shaft and handle or lever that
moved it .and the bolts that it moved, in connection with the
corridor doors thereby looked and unlocked, were precisely the
same with or without a wall or grating interposed between
the handle or lever and the door locked; that the operation
and effect of the arrangement of the lever (b), bar (a), and bolts
or lugs S, as described in the patent, were precisely the same,
whether the lever was operated through a wall or grating or
not; that mechanically the effect was precisely the same with
or without the grating, so far as fastening and unfastening
the doors was concerned; that the only difference was in the
effect of the grating to protect the jailer and guard against
escapes; that every separate element of the combination of
claim 4 was old, the levers, the bars, the bolts or lugs and the
grating; that levers had been used long before the patent to
move a lQng bar and thereby move bolts, lugs or the like at a
distance, and so had similar devices passing through a wall to
open and close window-shutters and the like, but that the particular combination adapted to interpose protection between
the person operating the device and persons on the other side
of the wall or grating, was new; that the grating had nothing
to do directly with locking or unlocking the doors, but afforded
protection to the operator while so doing; that all the elements of claim 3 of the patent were old; and that it was only
the particular combination applied to the purpose indicated
that was new.
As the angle door was an old contrivance, it is manifest that
the combination of it with the safe lock or bolt I, claimed in
claim 1, was not new or patentable. As the witness Monlton
says, locks and bolts upon doors are old, and to put a lock or
bolt upon an angle door would not be invention. Nor is the
combination of an angle door, with a lock of any kind, a patentable invention, even though the particular lock had not
before been put upon an angle door. Moreover, the combination claimed in claim 1 is one of the angle doo with the
particular lock or bolt I, that is, such lock or bolt as an integral
part of the safe or box J, with its drum (p) and connections,
in which view the apparatus in the defendant's jail does not
infringe claim 1-

406'

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

As to the patentability of claims 3 and 4, the feature which
it is alleged makes both of them patentable is the intrposition
of a barrier between the jailer and the prisoners. In claim 3,
the sliding doors are opened and closed, while the angle door
is still locked. In claim 4, the cell doors are fastened by
means of the bolts or lugs S, during the time the grated doors
in the corridor are securely closed. In view of the evidence,
it is clear that the devices covered by claims 3 and 4, as
mechanical devices, existed before, having the same mechanical elements and the same mechanical operation and effect.
The whole combination was the same, so far as it was a
mechanical or patentable combination, namely, a lever, a bar
passing through an interposed barrier, a lever or its mechanical
equivalent at the other end, and something to be moved by the
motion thus transmitted through the barrier. The patentee
merely used the same devices which had before been used by
other persons, between one side of an interposed barrier and
the other, with the same mechanical effect. His motive was,
and his use of the device was, to protect the jailer, by a sufficient barrier, from being injured by the prisoners; but neither
the motive nor the strength of the barrier can enter as an
element into the question. The case is one merely of a double
use. The mechanism was old in its use to move a door or a
gate at a distance, and the mechanical operation of the device
was the same, whether the mechanism passed through a solid
.ron barrier, or a grated iron barrier, or a barrier of another
material, or through no barrier at all. Mr. Moulton testifies
that the mechanical effect is precisely the same with or without the grating, so far as fastening and unfastening the doors
is concerned, the only difference being in the effect of the
grating to protect the jailer and guard against escapes. Tucker

As the mechanical operation and effect of the patented
devices are the same, whether there be a grating or other
barrier or not, there is no patentable combination between the
devices and the grating. The grating performs no mechanical
function and has no mechanical effect. The case is one of
mere aggregation. Pickering v. M1c Cullough, 104 _U. S. 310,

357, the sixth section of which, 5 Stat. 119, provides for the
granting of a patent for "any new and useful art, machine,
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter." It was not granted for an art. or process,
that is, "an act or a series of acts performed upon the subject
matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or
thing." Cochrane, v. .Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788. So far as
the grating is sought to be made an element in the combinations of claims 3 and 4, it is not an element of the mechanism.
It is no part of the machine, and has no effect upon its
operation. INor is the apparatus a manufacture or a composition of matter. In the patent, the invention is called one of
an "improvement in the construction of prisons," and in the
specification it is called an invention of "improvements in the
construction and operation of prisons." In Jacobs v. Baker, 7
Wall. 295, suit was brought on four patents for "improve,
ments in the construction of prisons." One was for a secret
passage or guard-chamber around the outside of an iron-plate
jail, and between the jail and the surrounding inclosure, constructed for the purpose of allowing the keeper to oversee and
overhear the prisoners without their being conscious of his
presence. Another was for iniproved iron walls for iron-plate
jails. Another was for an impriovement in joining the metal

plates. Another was for arranging iron-plate cells in jails.
This court held that an improvement in the construction of a
jail did not come under the denomination of a machine, or a,
manufacture, or a composition of matter; and that it was
doubtful whether it could be classed as an art. But, however
this may be, the grating, in the present case, can34ot be considered as a part of a patentable mechanical combination.
