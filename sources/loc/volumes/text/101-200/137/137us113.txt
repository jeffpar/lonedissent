WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Syllabus.

($51,412.62) fifty-one thousand four- hundred and twelve and
2 dollars, debt, with interest from June 25, 1889," the date
of the return of the verdict, and costs of suit. It thus appears
that the court held that the sum total, as found by the jury,
was correct, and ignored the division of that amount into two
sums. If the $3474.65 was for interest, it was as much less
than the interest properly calculated amounted to as the
$47,937.97 was more than the aggregate of the several sums
claimed, exclusive of the first branch of the third cause of
action, and of the fourteenth. There was also evidence in
support of some items of expenditure which apparently could
have been recovered under the fourteenth cause of action, and
it may be that these were allowed by the jury, and the court
was of opinion that this was properly done, notwithstanding
its instruction. The bill of exceptions shows that on the
third day of the trial "both parties were given leave to amend
their pleadings to conform to the facts," and some confusion
has evidently arisen from the circumstance that what was
done under that leave is not clearly shown by the record.
The motion for a new trial was addressed to the discretion of
the Circuit Court, and action on such a motion is not a subject of exception.
Upon the whole, we find no sufficient ground for disturbing
the judgment, and itois accordingly
Affirmed.

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 46. Argued October 31, November 3, 1890.-

Decided November 17, 1890.

The Court of Claims disallowed the claim of the administrator de bonfs non
of Colonel Francis Taylor, for five years' full pay to Taylor, as a colonel
of infantry, under the resolution of the Continental Congress of March
22. 1783, (4 Jour. Cong. 178,) holding that he was not in the military
service, in the continental line, to the close of the war of the Revolution
in 1783. This court affirms the judgment.
VOL. cxxxvr-8

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.
Nor was Colonel Taylor entitled to half pay for life under the resolutions of
October 3 and 21, 1780, (3 Jour. Cong. 532, 538,) because he was not a
"reduced" officer.
He was not entitled to recover under the provisions of the act of Congress
of July 5, 1832, (4 Stat. 563.)
Under ยง 906 of the Revised Statutes, the decision of the governor of Virginia, made under the act of that State, of March 11, 1834, (Laws of
1834, c. 6, p. 22,) that Colonel Taylor was a "colonel in the continental
line from October 1, 1775, to the close of the war," is not either obligatory in law, or conclusive as evidence, against the United States.
The Court of Claims did not err in refusing to find that Colonel Taylor
"was an officer in the continental service on the 22d day of March, 1783,
and continued therein as such officer to the end of the war," whether that
was a conclusion of fact or one of law.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.

.Mr. George S. Boutwell and .r.

P. E. Dye for appellant.

Xr. Assistant Attorney General Parker for appellees.

M.R. JUsTIcE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims,
dismissing the petition of John G. Williams, administrator de
bonis non of Francis Taylor, against the United States.
The original petition was filed by George Taylor Jenkins
and others, December 8, 1865. After a traverse and an
amended petition, an answer was filed to the latter, and also
a special plea, and the case was submitted to the court, June
10, 1868. On June 15, 1868, a judgment was rendered dismissing the petition. A motion for a new trial was made in
December, 1868, and granted in December, 1869. An amended
petition was filed in December, 1877, and a traverse thereto ;
and in February, 1878, the court ordered that John G. Williams, as administrator do bonis non of Francis Taylor, be substituted as the claimant, and he filed, on the 18th of April,
1878, the petition which is now before us. A traverse was
filed thereto, together with a special plea, to which latter there
was a replication. The court entered a judgment on June 7,
1880, dismissing the petition, and filed certain findings of fact

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

and conclusions of law, with an opinion, which are set forth
in the report of the case, in 15 0. 01. 514. Those findings
embrace identically the findings now before us, to and including finding 10.
On the 7th of September, 1880, at the same term, the claimant filed a motion for a new trial, on the ground of newly
discovered evidence. This motion was held over until the 14th
of March, 1887, when the court overruled it, giving an opinion
which is reported in 22 C. 01. 116. It also then substituted
new findings of fact and conclusions of law instead of the
original ones, (the findings of fact being the same as the original ones to and including finding 10, and adding finding 11.)
On the 16th of May, 1887, it made an order which vacated
and set aside the judgment of June 7, 1880, and entered a new
judgment nune.pro tune as of March 14, 1887, dismissing the
petition. The appeal of the claimant is for a review of this
last judgment.
The amended findings of fact, with the conclusions of law
thereon, are as follows :
"1. Francis Taylor was commissioned captain in the Second State Regiment of the Virginia forces on continental
establishment May 8, 1776; he continued in active service, and
was promoted and commissioned major in said regiment with
rank from July 12, 1778, and he became supernumerary major
by the arrangement of the continental army at White Plains
in September, 1778.
"2. The regiment, commonly designated as the Albemarle
Guards, was originally authorized by the resolution 19th December, 1778, of the House of Delegates of the State of Virginia, but was taken up on continental establishment under
and by virtue of the resolution 9th January, 1779 (3 Jour.
Cong. 179). From the 9th January to the 5th March, 1779,
Francis Taylor was in command of the regiment as lieutenantcolonel. On March 5, 1779, he was commissioned as colonel
by the Governor of Virginia, and as such commanded said
battalion up to the 15th day of June, 1781, when the battalion
was disbanded by the discharge of such men as were enlisted
to serve only during the continuance of the convention prisoners in the State of Virginia.

OCTOBER TER-M, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

"3. There is no. evidence showing that Colonel Francis
Taylor ever resigned his commission in the continental service,
or that he was ever otherwise than ready and willing to render
service in the same or higher grade when required so to do.
"4. The acceptance of the Virginia line, and officers, of the
commutation offered under the resolution of Congress of
March 22, 1783, was made and duly reported as required by
the resolution.
"5. Colonel Francis Taylor died on or about the 16th day
of November, 1799.
"6. Colonel Francis Taylor was not paid the half-pay for
life under the resolution of Congress of October 21, 1780, and
no commutation certificate was issued to him or his heirs in
lieu thereof.
"7. Colonel Francis Taylor, during his lifetime, and his
heirs and legal representatives since, have made frequent and
continuous application to the government and to Congress for
the payment of this claim up to the time of bringing this suit;
and on the 22d day of January, 1859, a memorial to Congress
praying its payment was referred by the House of Representatives to this court for adjudication.
"Which resolution is in the words following:
"'Ordered, That the petitions and papers in the cases of Dr.
Charles Taylor, Colonel Francis Taylor, and James Broadus
be withdrawn from the files of the House and referred to the
Court of Claims.' House Journal, 1858-'59, p. 241.
"8. It appears, and the court finds the fact to be, that on
the 5th March, 1779, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, then commanding the regiment known as the Albemarle Guards, was
commissioned as colonel by the Governor of Virginia, and that
he continued to command the regiment with the rank of
colonel until it was disbanded. It further appears that the
regiment continued in the continental service after the expiration of the year's service designated in the resolution of 9th
January, 1779 (3 Jour. Cong. 179), and until the 15th June,
1781, when the regiment was disbanded. It further appears
that on the 13th February, 1781, while the Baron Steuben
was acting as inspector-general of the continental forces, and

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

was charged with the duty of consolidating and reducing the
regiments of the line furnished by Virginia, under the resolutions of 3d and 21st October, 1780 (3 Jour. Cong. 532, 538),
Mr. Jefferson, then Governor of Virginia, addressed the following official communication to Colonel Taylor:
"'IRcHmoND, Feb. 13, 1781.

"'Sin: . . . Congress having determined newly to
model their forces, the Baron Steuben is now here on that
business.
"' The Assembly have directed the Executive to have the
same done as to the State troops.
"'Your regiment, being in the continental service, will be
submitted to Baron Steuben. Till this be done, which, however, will be done in a few days, no promotions can take
place.'
"And on the 14th March, 1781, Mr. Jefferson, as Governor
of Virginia, likewise addressed the following official communication to Colonel Taylor:
"' IN Couiamo,

"'Sin: Before this comes to hand Col. Wood will have
received orders to carry the conventioners to Knowland's
Ferry, thence to be guarded by the State of Maryland.
"' At that place, therefore, you will please to discharge such
of your regiment as were enlisted to serve only during the
continuance of the conventioners in Albemarle or in this
State.'

.

"It also appears that Mr. Jefferson, while Governor of Virginia, on the 28th of November, 1779, addressed the following
communication to the commander-in-chief:
"' 1WmLAsBuRG, November 28, 1779.

immediately laid it before the assembly, who thereupon came
to the resolution I now send you.
"' The resolution of Congress of March 15, 1779, which you
were so kind as to inclose, was never known in this State till
a few weeks ago, when we received printed copies of the Journal of Congress.
"' It would be a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact
return of all the men we have in continental service who come
within the description of the resolution, together with our
State troops in continental service. Colonel Cabell was so
kind as to send me a return of the continental regiments commanded by Lord Stirling, of the First and Second Virginia
State regiments, and of Colonel Gist's regiment.
"'Besides these are the following, viz.: Colonel Harrison's
regiment of artillery, Colonel Baylor's horse, Colonel Bland's
horse, General Scott's new levies, part of which are gone to
Carolina and a part are here. Colonel Gibson's regiment stationed on the Ohio, Heath and O'Hare's independent companies at the Stomel station, Colonel Taylor's regiment of guards
to the convention troops, of these we have a return.
"'There may possibly be others not occurring to me.
"'A return of all these would enable us to see what proportion of the continental army is contributed by us.'
"It further appears that no official records are known to
exist which set forth the grounds upon which Colonel Taylor
was commissioned as Colonel of the Albemarle Guards on the
5th March, 1779 ; nor any official record which would explain
the reason why the said regiment continued in service beyond
the year for which it was enlisted under the resolution of 9th
January, 1779; nor any official record which would show
whether the said regiment or a portion of it did or did not reenlist for the war under the resolution of January 23d, 1779
(3 Jour. Cong. 190); nor any official record which would show
whether a portion of the said regiment continued in service
after the regiment was disbanded on the 15th June, 1781 ; nor

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

any official record which would show that Colonel Taylor was
discharged from the service when his regiment was disbanded.
"But it appears from an ancient writing found in the public archives of the State of Virginia, purporting to be the proceedings of 'a board of field officers, begun at Chesterfield,
February 10, 1781, by order of Major-General Baron Steuben,
for the purpose of arranging the Virginia line,' that the regiments reduced in the State of Virginia under the resolutions 3d
'and 21st October, 1780 (3 Jour. Cong. 532-8), were the eleven
regiments of the Virginia line and one regiment of artillery,
the former during the month of February being reduced to
eight regiments; and that the only colonels mentioned in the
said proceedings as reduced were Colonels William .Heath and
Abraham Buford, two of the twelve regiments being at the
time without colonels. It does not appear that any other
reduction of Virginia troops took place under the resolutions
3d and 21st October than that at Chesterfield; nor does it
appear that the regiment known as the Albemarle Guards was
reduced by the Baron Steuben or by any other official authority under the resolutions aforesaid. The ancient writing referred to is among the official papers of the first auditor's
office of the State of Virginia; it is not signed or authenticated by any person, but was placed among the official records
not long subsequent to the proceedings of the board, and has
always been treated by the officers having it in charge as an
authentic record of the proceedings of the board.
"9. No certificate of indebtedness, as prescribed by the resolution March 22, 1783 (4 Jour. Cong. 178), was ever issued to
Colonel Taylor by the superintendent of finance for the commutation of five years' full pay, instead of the half-pay for life
given to officers of the continental army by the previous resolution, October 21, 1780; nor by the Paymaster-General, as
prescribed by the resolution 4th July, 1783 (4 Jour. Cong. 237).
"On the 30th July, 1783, the State of Virginia, by the auditor of public accounts, pursuant to an act of assembly, passed
at the November session, 1781 (10 iening Stats. Va. 462),
settled the account of Colonel Taylor for the balance of his
full pay, commonly known as 'depreciation pay,' and issued

to him evidence of indebtedness for ยฃ679 19s. 2d., this being
for his services as lieutenant-colonel from the 24th December,
1778, to the 5th March, 1779; and for his services as colonel
from the 5th March, 1779, to the 15th June, 1781. And at
various times subsequent to the 27th November, 1783, the
State of Virginia, by the proper officers, issued to Colonel
Taylor land warrants for eight years of service as an officer in
the continental army.
"The foregoing payment of the State of Virginia of ยฃ679*
19s. 2d. was one of the payments of that State to continental
officers subsequently assumed and refunded to the State by the
United States. On the 4th of February, 1850, the Commissioner of Pensions issued to the administrator of Colonel
Taylor's estate a land warrant for services as colonel in the
continental army.
"10. The five years' full pay authorized by the resolution
22d March, 1783 (4 Jour. Cong. 178), amounted, for a colonel
of infantry, to the sum of $4500.
"11. On the 19th 'day of March, 1834, John H. Smith,
commissioner, reported to the Governor of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, in the case of the heirs of Francis Taylor, in the
following words:
"'H11eirs of Francis Taylor, Colonel Continental.
"'Colonel Taylor has received land for a service of eight
years as major.
"' He was colonel in the continental service and ought to
have been allowed land in that character.
"' There is no proof of his being entitled to land for a longer
time than eight years.
"' His heirs are entitled to the difference between the bounty
to a colonel and that to major for a service of eight years.
"'This claim has been reported in List No. 2, which has
been printed by order of the House of Delegates.

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

"The name of Francis Taylor was reported with the rank of
colonel in the continental line for a service of eight years by
John I. Smith, commissioner, in List No. 2, 'of officers of the
Virginia Continental and State Lines,' &c., 'whose names
appear on the Army Register,' and that said List No. 2 was
reported by the governor in his message to the House of
Delegates of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and was by them
ordered printed in 1834, as Executive Doc. No. 31.
"Subsequently the Governor of the Commonwealth of
Virginia rendered his decision on the report of the commissioner in the case of the heirs of Francis Taylor in the following words:
"'To the heirs of Francis Taylor for his services as colonel
in the continental line from October 1, 1775, to the close
of the war:
Ordered, That the register issue warrants accordingly, if
not already drawn.'
"'

"And upon the foregoing findings of fact the court decides
as conclusions of law: "(1.) The foregoing circumstantial facts set forth in finding
8, taken in connection with the contemporary resolutions of
the Continental Congress and the historical events of the war
occurring during the same period, are not sufficient evidence
to authorize or sustain a finding of the ultimate fact that a
portion of the soldiers of Colonel Taylor's regiment of guards
re-enlisted for the war and became soldiers in the continental
service without the limitations attached to their original enlistment under the resolution 9th January, 1779.
"(2.) The facts set forth in all of the findings are not sufficient to authorize or sustain a finding of the ultimate fact
that Colonel Taylor's regiment of guards was reduced on the
15th June, 1781, under and in pursuance of the resolutions 3d
and 21st October, 1780. 3 Jour. Cong. 532-8.
"(3.) The claimant, upon the foregoing findings, is not entitled to judgment under and by virtue of the provisions of the
act 5th July, 1832. 4 Stat. 563.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

"(4.) The report of the commissioner of the State of Virginia set forth in finding 11, though approved and adopted by
the Governor of that State, is neither obligatory in law, nor
conclusive as evidence, against the United States."
On the 14th of March, 1887, after the 11th finding of fact
had been filed, the claimant moved to amend it by prefixing
thereto the following:
"On the 11th day of March, 1834, the General Assembly of
the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act in these words:
"'BI e it enacted by the General Assembly,' That John H.
Smith be, and he is hereby, appointed and constituted a commissioner, whose duty it shall be to continue the examination
directed under a resolution of the General Assembly of the
21st day of February, 1833, touching the revolutionary documents of this Commonwealth, and he shall lay before the
Governor any information he may discover as to any unsatisfied revolutionary claims of this Commonwealth on the government of the United States.
"1It shall, moreover, be the duty of the said commissioner
to examine all claims for military land bounties, not heretofore
decided on, which may arise under any existing law or resolution of the General Assembly, and report the facts relating
to the same, together with any remarks which he may deem
pertinent and proper, to the Governor of this Commonwealth,
whose decision thereupon shall be final.' "
The court made on this application the following ruling:
"Inasmuch as the Supreme Court takes judicial cognizance of
statutes, State as well as National, and the practice of finding
State laws would be an inconvenience, this request is refused."
At the same time the claimant asked the court to find the
following fact: "12. Colonel Francis Taylor was an officer
in the continental service on the 22d day of March, 1783, and
continued therein as such officer to the end of the war." On
that application the court made the following ruling: "Inasmuch as this finding involves a deduction from specific facts
and circumstances which, so far as they are established by the

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

evidence, are set forth in the previous findings, and really involves a conclusion of law, it is refused."
The claim of the plaintiff now made before us is for the sum
of $45002 being the amount of five years' full pay to Colonel Francis Taylor as a colonel of infantry, as being authorized by the resolution of the Continental Congress of March
22, 1783, (4 Jour. Cong. 178,) mentioned in finding 10, with
interest thereon from September 3, 1783, the date of the final
treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain,
at the rate of six per cent per annum, amounting in the aggregate to $32,310. This claim is founded upon the view that
Colonel Taylor was in the military service, in the continental
line, to the close of the war of the Revolution in 1783.
The resolution of Congress of March 22, 1783, was as follows: "Whereas the officers of the several lines under the
immediate command of His Excellency General Washington,
did, by their late memorial transmitted by their committee,
represent to Congress, that the half-pay granted by sundry
resolutions was regarded in an unfavorable light by the citizens of some of the States, who would prefer a compensation
for a limited term of years, or by a sum in gross, to an establishment for life; and did, on that account, solicit a commutation of their half-pay for an equivalent in one of the two
modes above mentioned, in order to remove all subject of
dissatisfaction from the minds of their fellow-citizens; and
whereas Congriess are desirous, as well of gratifying the reasonable expectations of the officers of the army, as of removing all objections which may exist in any part of the United
States, to the principle of the half-pay establishment, for
which the faith of the United States hath been pledged; persuaded that those objections can only arise from the nature of
the compensation, not from any indisposition to compensate
those whose services, sacrifices, and sufferings have so just a
title to the approbation and rewards of their country:
"Therefore, 'esolved, That such officers as are now in service, and shall continue therein to the end of the war, shall be
entitled to receive the amount of five years' full pay in money
or securities on interest at six per cent per annum, as Congress

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

shall find most convenient, instead of half-pay promised -for
life, by the resolution of the 21st day of October, 1780; the
said securities to be such as shall be given to other creditors
of the United States, provided it be at the option of the lines
of the respective States, and not of officers individually in
those lines, to accept or refuse the same; and provided, also,
that their election shall be signified to Congress through the
commander-in-chief from the lines under his immediate command, within two months, and through the commanding officer of the Southern army, from those under his command,
within six months from the date of this resolution:
"That the same commutation shall extend to the corps not
belonging to the lines of particular States; and who are
entitled to half-pay for life as aforesaid; the acceptance or
refusal to be determined by corps, and to be signified in the
same manner, within the same time as above mentioned:
"That all officers belonging to the hospital department,
who are entitled to half-pay by the resolution of the 17th day
of January, 1781, may collectively agree to accept or refuse
the aforesaid commutation, signifying the same through the
commander-in-chief within six months from this time; that
such officers as have retired at different periods, entitled to
half-pay for life, may collectively, in each State of which they
are inhabitants, accept or refuse the same; their acceptance
or refusal to be signified by agents authorized for that purpose, within six months from this period; that with respect
to such retiring officers, the commutation, if accepted by them,
shall be in lieu of whatever may be now due to them since
the time of their retiring from service, as well as of what
might hereafter become due; and that so soon as their acceptance shall be signified, the superintendent of finance be, and
he is hereby, directed to take measures for the settlement of
their accounts accordingly, and to issue to them certificates
bearing interest at seven per cent. That all officers entitled
to half-pay for life not included in the preceding resolution
may also collectively agree to accept or refuse the aforesaid
commutation, signifying the same within six months from
this time."

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

The resolution of October 21, 1780, (3 Jour. Cong. 538),
referred to in the resolution of March 22, 1783, was preceded
by another resolution of October 3, 1780 (3 Jour. Cong. 532).
The material provisions of these resolutions are set forth in
the opinion of the Court of Claims, 15 C. Cl. 514, in the terms
contained in the margin.1
1 "The Continental Congress, by the Resolutions 3d October and 21st October, 1780, (3 Jour. Cong. pp. 532, 538,) determined to reorganize the army
in a manner which would involve the consolidation or reduction of regiments. The army, which was to be reduced, as designated by the resolutions, then consisted of sixteen ' additional regiments,' some or all of
which had not been ' annexed to the line' of any ' particular State,' of certain specifically-named irregular battalions and light corps, and of eighty
battalions, known as the continental line. As to the ' sixteen additional
battalions,' and the irregular battalions specifically named, the resolutions
directed that they ' be reduced,' and the non-commissioned officers and privates ' be incorporated with the troops of their respective States.' This
provision related to troops which had been raised directly by Congress, and
its purpose was threefold -to sweep them out of existence as organizations, to transfer the men to the regular regiments of the continental line,
and to credit them to the quotas of their respective States.
"The resolutions next provided for the further reorganization of the
army at large - of the continental line. So far as this case is concerned,
it is sufficient to say that they provided, in effect, that the eleven regiments
in the line furnished by Virginia should be reduced to eight, and that no
mention of the Albemarle Guards is made in the resolutions.
"Having thus provided for the transfer of men and reduction of regiments, the resolutions further declared with regard to the officers who
would necessarily be thrown out by the reduction:
"' And whereas, by the foregoing arrangement, many deserving officers
must become supernumerary, and it is proper that regard be had to them:
""Resolved, That from the time the reform of the army takes place they
be entitled to half-pay for seven years, in specie or other current money
equivalent, and also grants of land at the close of the war, agreeably to the
resolution of the 16th of September, 1776.
"' Ordered, That a copy of the foregoing arrangement of the army be
sent to the commander-in-chief for his opinion thereon, and that, if there
shall appear no material objections, the same be carried into immediate
effect.' (Resolution October 3, 1780.)"
"' Congress resumed the consideration of the report of the committee
on General Washington's letter of the 11th; and thereupon ...
"' Resolved, That the whole of the troops be enlisted during the war, and
join their respective corps by the 1st day of January next.
"' That the commander-in-chief and c~mmanding officer in the Southern

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

It is apparent from the conclusions of law (1) and (2) and
the opinion of the Court of Claims, that the question litigated
before that court was the ultimate fact, whether a portion of
the soldiers of Colonel Taylor's regiment 6f Albemarle Guards
(which regiment was originally raised for a service of one
year, and was disbanded June 15, 1781) re-enlisted for the war
and became soldiers in the continental service, without the
limitations attached to their original enlistment under the
resolution of the Continental Congress of January 9, 1779,
(3 Jour. Cong. 179.) That resolution was as follows: "Resolved, That a battalion, consisting of 600 men, properly
officered, be forthwith raised on continental establishment in
Virginia, for the space of one year from the time of their
enlistment, unless sooner discharged, under the direction of
the governor and council of that State, who are hereby
empowered to appoint the officers of the said battalion out of
those of the Virginia line who have been left oilt of the late
arrangement of the continental army, as far as their numbers
will reach; the regiment to consist of one lieutenant colonel
commandant and captain, one major and captain, six captains,
one captain lieutenant, seven lieutenants, nine ensigns, one
surgeon, one surgeon's mate, eight companies of 75 men each,
including corporals, three sergeants, one drum and one fife to
each company:
"That these troops be stationed at, and not removed (except to such distances as the duty of the post may require)
from the barracks in Albemarle County, as guards over the
convention troops; that they receive the usual pay of the continental army, and a suit of clothes as a bounty to each noncommissioned officer and private:
"That as soon as the said regiment shall be so far completed
Department direct the officers of each State to meet and agree upon the
officers for the regiments to be raised by their respective States, from those
who incline to continue in the service; and where it cannot be done by
agreement, to be determined by seniority, and make return of those who
are to remain, which is to be transmitted to Congress, together with the
names of the officers reduced, who are to be allowed half-pay for life.'
(Resolution October 21, 1780.)"

WILLIAM2S v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

as to be able to do the duty of the post, the militia now in the
service there be discharged."
It also appears that the further question was litigated,
whether the court was authorized to find the ultimate fact
that the regiment of guards, when it was disbanded on the
15th of June, 1781, was "reduced," within the terms of the
resolutions of October 3 and 21, 1780.
The opinion of the Court of Claims says of the claim in
suit that it "has regretfully reached the conclusion that the
moral probabilities on which it rests do not constitute such
a foundation of circumstantial evidence as would sustain a
verdict in a suit at nisi vius, or authorize a judgment in this
court."
It further says: "During the period of the revolution the
term muster-out was not used, and troops, either individually
or as organizations, are spoken of as 'discharged' when dismissed from the continental service. A regiment broken up
and consolidated is spoken of. as 'reduced,' and officers who
were thereby thrown out and became unattached were designated as 'supernumeraries.' The consolidated regiments,
moreover, are variously designated, as 'the new arrangement,'
the 'new establishment,' the 'newly constructed corps,' etc.
As to the term 'disbanded,' it seems to have had no technical
significance. When a regiment was disbanded some of its
soldiers may have been discharged and some transferred to
other regiments, the term denoting simply the dissolution of
the regiment."
The opinion says, that Francis Taylor, who was then a
major and supernumerary officer, thrown out by the consolidation of regiments in 1778, known as the White Plains
arrangement, and liable to be called into service on the one
hand and entitled to half-pay for life on the other, was
assigned to the command of the Albemarle Guards with the
rank of lieutenant-colonel, that body being a regiment raised
for the purpose of guarding the captured army of General
Burgoyne, known as "the convention troops," the duty of
guarding whom had been assigned to the State of Virginia;
and that Francis Taylor was commissioned as colonel of the

Opinion of the Court.

regiment by the Governor of Virginia on the 5th of March,
1779. It also says, that the regiment of guards was not designated in direct terms in the resolutions of October 3 and 21,
1780, nor embraced in any general classification contained in
those resolutions; that it was raised for the space of one year
from the time of enlistment, unless sooner discharged; that it
was to be "stationed at and not removed (except to such distances as the duty of the post may require) from the barracks
in Albemarle County, as guards over the convention troops;"
that if it continued on that basis until it was discharged in
June, 1781, its officers did not become supernumeraries under
the resolutions of October 3 and 21, 1780, for reorganizing the
continental army; that the guards would have passed out of
existence before the time for reorganization arrived; and that,
as originally constituted, it had no enlisted soldiers who could
be transferred to the regiments of the line, because its soldiers
were enlisted for a limited period and for a limited, designated
service, which service was to be rendered within prescribed,
narrow, territorial limits. The opinion states the question to
be, therefore, whether the guards, or a portion of them, had
re-enlisted for the war, under the resolution of Congress of
January 23, 1779, (3 Jour. Cong. 190,) and became reduced,
or consolidated with other regiments, under the resolutions
of October, 1780.
The resolution referred to, of January 23, 1779, was "that
the commander-in-chief be authorized and directed to take the
most effectual measures to reinlist for the continuance of the
war, all such of the continental troops as are not expressly
engaged for that period," and it promised new bounties and
rewards "to each able-bodied soldier now in the service and
who shall voluntarily reinlist during the war."
The opinion then proceeds to consider the arguments
adduced on the part of the claimant to show that the soldiers
of the guards did re-enlist, and in regard to those arguments
says: "The circumstances and coincidences so much relied
upon, though they might appeal strongly, as establishing a
moral probability, to a body possessed of legislative discretion,
do not rise to the standard of legal evidence and are insuffi-

Opinion of the Court.

cient to authorize a judgment or sustain a verdict. No authen*cated document nor official record has been produced to
show that a single soldier of Colonel Taylor's regiment had
re-enlisted for the war, or was liable to serve beyond the
limits of the State of Virginia, or could have been transferred
to regiments of the line, under the resolutions. No such averment was made by Colonel Taylor himself in his petitions to
Congress and the house of delegates, nor is it alluded to in
any contemporary report, letter or communication. Neither
the house of delegates, in 1783, nor the Secretary of War,
General Knox, in 1791, regarded the Albemarle Guards as
one of the regiments which had been reduced and consolidated under the resolutions of 1780; and the silence of
the resolutions themselves, with all their particularity as
to other commands, indicates that the Continental Congress were not aware of there being soldiers in the guards
who were liable to be transferred to the line. Moreover, the
time when the regiment was disbanded, June 15, 1781, was
subsequent to the consolidation of the Virginia regiments by
the Baron Steuben, (February,) and the apparent cause of disbandment was not its consolidation with other regiments,
but the termination of the service or duty for which it had
been raised and on which it had been exclusively engaged.
The mention of the guards in the resolutions 9th February,
1780, (3 Jour. Cong. 432,) and in the correspondence of Mr.
Jefferson with General Washington, on which great stress
was laid in the argument, was applicable to the regiment,
whether its soldiers had re-enlisted or not; for it was proper
and just that its soldiers, who were continuing in service
beyond the period of their enlistment, and who, in all seeming
likelihood, were to continue in the service of guarding the
prisoners till the end of the war, should be credited to the
quota of Virginia."
The opinion then gives the language of the resolutions of
February 9, 1780, which are set forth in the margin,' and pro1 Resolved, That for the ensuing campaign the States be respectively

ceeds: "The first purpose of the resolutions was manifestly
to fix and determine the number of men which each Stafe
should contribute. The second likewise related to State quotas, being a declaration that all of the men whose terms of
service would not expire before the last of September following should be credited to their respective States, accompanied
by a pledge that the men (not the officers and men) of certain
irregular organizations, ' including the guards,' ' should be provided for, deemed, and treated in the same manner' as the
men in the line. The third provision was a recommendation
to the States 'to make like provision for the officers and men I
of the designated irregular corps, 'including the guards' as
might be made 'for the officers and men of their respective
battalions.' In the first provision the guards were referred to
as a corps which had, or which might have had, men who
should be credited on the quota of Virginia; in the third the
April next, their respective deficiencies of the number of 35,211 men, exclusive of commissioned officers, which Congress deem necessary for the service of the present year.

" That all the men whose times of service do not expire before the last

which they respectively belong, whether they compose the battalions in the
line of the several States, those of the additional corps, including the
guards, the artillery and horse, or the regimental artificers in the departments of the quartermaster general and commissary general of military
stores, who, being credited to the States respectively, should be provided
for, deemed and treated in the same manner with the men in the several
State lines; and it is recommended to the several States to make like provision for the officers and men of the artillery, horse, additional corps,
including the guards and regimented artificers, as may be made in pursuance
of any resolution of Congress, for the officers and men of their respective
battalions; with such exceptions, respecting the regimented artificers, as
have been made by Congress in their acts concerning them."

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

officers and men of the guards are designated as among those
for whom the States should make the same provision which
they would make ' in pursuance of any resolution of Congress '
for the officers and men of their respective battalions. It is
true that the language of the resolutions does seem to indicate
that then, on the 9th February, 1780, there were men in the
guards 'whose times of service do not expire before the last
date of September next.' But it is also true that the words,
'including the guards,' in the first provision, may have been
intended merely as a comprehensive, sweeping clause, equivalent to saying that all men whose times of service did not
expire, in whatever corps they might be found, should be
counted upon the quota of Virginia; and that the same words
in the third provision were intended as new legislation, as a
special provision to classify the guards, who were continuing
to serve beyond their times of enlistment, with men whose
enlistment would not expire 'before the last date of September next.' Be that as it may, we caunnot accept the ambiguous
phraseology of the resolutions as authoritatively fixing the
desired fact that the guards, or a portion of them, bad re-enlisted for the war, and were liable to be reduced and consolidated under the resolutions which followed in October of the
same year. It was proper and just that these officers and men
should be thus provided for; but it does not follow that such
a recognition establishes the fact that. they stood on the same
basis of enlistment for the war and for service in the field that
the troops of the line stood upon."
Referring to the fact of the "depreciation pay" which Colonel Taylor received for the time he served as colonel of the'
guards, from March 5, 1779, to June 15, 1781, under the resolution of Congress of April 10, 1780, (3 Jour. Cong. 447,)
which provided that "no person shall have any benefit of this
resolution, except such as were engaged during the war, or for
three years, and are now in service," the opinion says: "Fi.

April, 1780, was only to be gven to persons who 'had
engaged to serve during the war, or for three years,' may well

Opinion of the Court.

eer in actual service, by virtue of the terms of his original
enlistment. But whatever the theory upon which it was
allowed, we cannot infer from it the fact that Colonel Taylor's
regiment, in whole or in part, had re-enlisted for the war, and
that he had been reduced under the resolutions of October,
1I80. Upon the whole of the evidence we must rule that it is
insufficient to sustain a verdict, and that we are not at liberty,
when sitting in the stead of a jury, to pass upon it or to
deduce ultimate facts from it."
In the report of the case on the motion for a new trial, 22
C. C1. 116, it is stated that the purpose of the motion "is to
establish the fact that Colonel Francis Taylor, of the Albemarle Guards, continued in the service of the Continental
Congress after the disbandment of his command in June, IS71,
until the end of the war." On the argument before this court,
the counsel for the claimant contends that his right to recover
depends upon the question whether Colonel Taylor continued
in the service until the' end of the war, or was retired before
that time, and thereby became entitled to half-pay for life or
to the commutation therefor; that, if it be found that he did
not continue in the service until the end of the war, yet if he
.was retired or "reduced" at any time after October 21, 1780,
he was entitled to half-pay for life, under the resolution of
that date; that, as he was entitled to half-pay for life as a
major in 1778, the burden is upon the United States to show
that he did not continue in the service to the end of the war;
that it is not shown that he retired from the service in June,
11781, when the regiment was disbanded, or that he again
became a supernumerary; that, although the law providing
half-pay for life was modified by the resolutions of October 3
and 21, 1780, while he still commanded the guards, yet the
only modification was as to the time when the half-pay should
begin, the modification being that it should begin at the time
the officer was reduced or retired from the service; that this
modification was in force in June, 1781, when the guards were
disbanded; that under its provisions Colonel Taylor would
have been entitled to half-pay for life in his new grade as
colonel, to begin from the time the guards were disbanded,

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

even if he had then retired from the service; that if he had
been treated, in June, 1781, as a supernumerary major, he still
would have been entitled from that date to half-pay as a
major; that there is no evidence that he was reduced in rank;
and that he was a colonel in the continental army on the 15th
of June, 1781.
In the brief presented to us on this appeal, the counsel for
the claimant departs from the questions litigated in the Court
of Claims, as shown by the first two conclusions of law and
by the opinion of that court, and contends that the issue is as
to whether or not Colonel Taylor continued in the service to
the end of the war, or retired before that time; and that the
ultimate fact to be proved is the duration of his own personal service, and not the duration of the service of any of the
soldiers composing the guards. The contention appears to be
that, under the resolutions of October, 1780, a continuous
service throughout the war by Colonel Taylor, or his retirement before its close, entitled him to half-pay for life.
But this view is not tenable, because the resolution of October 3, 1780, provided for half-pay for only seven years, and
only for those officers who became supernumeraries under the
arrangement provided for by that resolution; and the resolution of October 21, 1780, had reference only to the sam
officers, whose names were to be transmitted to Congress, and
who are called therein "officers reduced," that is, in the language of the resolution of October 3, 1780, officers "thrown
out by the reduction." Those were the only officers who were
by the latter resolution "allowed half-pay for life." It is
inaccurate, therefore, to say that the only change made by the
resolutions of October, 1780, was as to the time half-pay for
life should begin.
Whether Colonel Taylor retired from service at the time the
regiment was disbanded, or whether he continued in the service to the end of the war, he was not a "reduced" officer,
within the meaning of that term, as used in the resolutions of
October, 1780. The scheme of those resolutions did not apply
to such organizations as that of the guards, nor to officers
who were not "reduced" under those resolutions, although

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

they should continue in service to the end of the war. An
officer who left the service at the end of the war was not
"reduced."
The commission of Francis Taylor as colonel came from the
Governor of Virginia, and the order to discharge the soldiers
of the regiment also came from him. It was an irregular
regiment created for a particular service, and charged with a
specific duty, to be performed in a designated locality. Service in the regiment was inconsistent with service in the continental army. Such commission as Francis Taylor held prior
to Januar y 9, 1779, was practically revoked by the terms of
the resolution of Congress of that date, which authorized the
governor and council of the State of Virginia to appoint the
officers of the new regiment out of those of the Virginia line
who had been "left out of the late arrangement of the continental army;" and by his acceptance of the appointment of
lieutenant-colonel of the new regiment. His obligation to
serve in the guards disqualified him from continuing as a
supernumerary in the continental service. He could not perform duty under his commission as lieutenant-colonel or colonel
of the guards, and at the same time hold himself in readiness
to respond to a call to the field in the continental service.
The third conclusion of law made by the Court of Claims
was that, upon its findings of fact, the claimant was not
entitled to judgment under and by virtue of the provisions of
the act of July 5, 1832 (4 Stat. 563). In regard to that statute, the court remarks, in its opinion, that it was intended to
reimburse the State of Virginia for certain judgments which
had been recovered against that State in her own courts, by
officers, for half-pay, and to pay directly, without waiting for
judgments to be recovered against the State, similar claims
covered by the decision in Lilly's Case, 1 Leigh, 529; that
the first section of that act is limited to officers commanding
in the " irginia line;" that the second section refers to certain regiments and corps specifically designated by name, and
does not specify the Albemarle Guards; that the third section
directs the Secretary of the Treasury "to adjust and settle
those claims" of officers "of the aforesaid regiments and

"WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

corps, which have not been paid or prosecuted to judgments
against the State of Virginia;" and that the benefits of the
third section are clearly limited to the regiments and corps
enumerated in the second section, and cannot be extended to
the officers of other regiments or corps, though they may have
a valid claim for -half-pay against that State. It is said in the
brief of the counsel for the claimant that it was never contended by him that that act was anything more than a
legislative interpretation of the several resolutions of the
Continental Congress which are in question, or that it created
any new liability on the part of the United States. We
concur in the view of the Court of Claims.
The fourth conclusion of law of that court was, that the
report of the commissioner of the State of Virginia, set forth
in finding 11, although approved and adopted by the governor
of that State, was neither obligatory in law upon, nor conclu
sive as evidence against, the United States.
The State of Virginia, on the 11th of March, 1831, (Laws of
18341, c. 6, p. 22,) passed an act appointing John HI. Smith a
commissioner, and making it his duty to coxtinue an examination previously directed touching the revolutionary documents
of the State, and to lay before the governor any information
he might discover as to any unsatisfied revolutionary claims
of the State on the government of the United States; and
further making it his duty to examine all claims for military
land bounties, not theretofore decided on, which might arise
under any existing laws or resolutions of the general assembly,
and to report the facts relating to the game, together with any
remarks he might deem pertinent and proper, to the governor
of the State, "whose decisions thereupon shall be final." The
decision of the governor on the report of the commissioner in
the case of the heirs of Francis Taylor was made in September,
1850, and speaks of Taylor "as colonel in the continental line
from Octdber 1, 1715, to the close of the wal'." It is contended by the claimant that, under section 906 of the Revised
Statutes, this decision of the governor of Virginia is conclusive
against the United States, to show that Taylor continued in
the continental service until the close of the war.

OCTOBER TERI,

1890.

Opinion of the Court.

The provision of section 906 is, that records and exemplifications of books kept in any public office of any State, when
authenticated in the manner provided by that section, "shall
have such faith and credit given to them in every court and
office within the United States as they have by law or usage
in the courts or offices of the State" from which they are
taken. The Court of Claims, in its opinion overruling the
motion for a new trial (22 C. Cl. 116,) states that the clause
above quoted from section 906 did not impart to the authenticated State record anything more than "faith and credit," and
did not extend the effect of a decision against a State to the
United States, nor make an award or judgment which might
be final against a State "either obligatory in law, or conclusive as evidence, against the United States." We concur in
this view.
It is also alleged for error by the claimant, that the Court
of Claims refused to find that "Colonel Francis Taylor was an
officer in the continental service on the 22d day of March, 1783,
and continued therein as such officer to the end of the war,"
stating, as the ground of its refusal, that the proposed finding
involved a deduction from specific facts and circumstances
which, so far as they were established by the evidence, were
set forth in the previous findings, and really involved a conclusion of law. The claimant contends that the finding requested was a conclusion of fact drawn from other specific
facts and circumstances established by the testimony; that he
was entitled to have that conclusion of fact found by the court;
that such fact was not it question of law; and that, even if it
were, the court erred in not finding it as a conclusion of law.
Perhaps, under the rulings of this court in United States v
Pugh, 99 U. S. 265, 270; Sun .MXutual ins. Co. v. Ocea Ins
Co., 107 U. S. 485, 503; T]e Belgenland, 114 U. S. 355,
362, and McClure v. United States, 116 U. S. 145, 151,
the question involved in the proposed finding which was
refused, was a question of law. In United States v. Pugh,
one of the issues to be determined was, whether the proceeds of the sale of certain captured property belonging to
the claimant had been paid into the Treasury. No direct

Opinion of the Court.

proof to that effect had been given, but, if shown at all, it
was by way of inference from certain circumstantial facts
established by the evidence and set forth in the findings of
the Court of Claims. This court said, that the Court of
Claims had found all the facts which had been established
directly by the evidence; that those facts were "the results
of evidence, and whether they establish the ultimate fact
to be reached is, if a question of fact at all, to say the
least, in the nature of a question of law;" that the inquiry
presented was as to the legal effect of facts proved, not of the
evidence given to make the proof ; that the question of practice to be settled was whether, under the rule of this court
as to appeals from the Court of Claims, the judgment of the
latter court as to the legal effect of what might, perhaps not
improperly, be called the ultimate circumstantial facts in a
case, was final and conclusive, or whether it could be reviewed
by this court; that, under that rule, this court could not consider the evidence but its attention must be confined to the
legal effect on the rights of the parties of the facts found by
the Court of Claims; and that, in that way, the weight of the
evidence was left for the sole consideration of that court, but
the ultimate effect of the facts which the direct evidence had
established was left open for review here on appeal. But
whether the proposed finding which was refused in the present case was a conclusion of law from the facts. already found,
or an additional conclusion of fact, we are of opinion that the
Court of Claims was correct in refusing to find it.
In the opinion, of the Court of Claims in 22 C. Cl. 116, it is
stated that part of the newly discovered evidence set up as a
ground for a new trial consisted of "certain resolves and proceedings of the Continental Congress, and certain resolves of
the general assembly of Virginia, and official correspondence
in the first and second volumes of the -State Papers of Virginia." In regard to these papers the Court of Claims says
that it is "of the opinion that if they had been put in evidence
on the trial they would not have changed the result." We
concur in this view, after having examined the papers.
This case is very much like that of Dr. Charles Taylor, re-

ported as Williams v. United States, 13 C. C1. 395. Charles
Taylor was a surgeon's mate in the continental army from
1776 to 1778, and then was reduced and became a supernumerary officer. In 1779 he was appointed a surgeon's mate in
the regiment of Albemarle Guards, and accepted and held that
position. In October, 1779, he was promoted to be surgeon
in the regiment, and held that place until the regiment was
discharged, June 15, 1781. He claimed five years' full pay as
surgeon in the Virginia line of the continental army, under
the same resolutions and proceedings that are now involved
in the case of Colonel Francis Taylor. The Court of Claims
decided that he could not have full pay as an officer of the
guards and at the same time be entitled to half-pay as a reduced and supernumerary officer. The claim was rejected and
there was an appeal to this court. The opinion of this court
is reported as Williams v. United States, 25 L. C. P. Co. ed.
309, and 14 C. Cl. 590. It is also referred to as No. 1058 on
page .ccxxviii of the appendix to 131 U. S. In its opinion,
this court, in affirming the judgment of the Court of Claims,
said that Dr. Charles Taylor did not continue in service until
the end of the war, within the meaning of the resolutions of
October 21, 1780, and Mlarch 22, 1783; that, when he accepted
his appointment in the regiment of the guards, in January,
1779, he ceased to be a supernumerary surgeon's mate, and
became an active officer in that regiment; that, when it was
discharged, because its term of enlistment had expired, he was
out of service; that, when it was raised, the governor and
council of Virginia were authorized by Congress to appoint its
officers out of those in the Virginia line who were then supernumerary; and that the acceptance of an appointment in the
new regiment took the officer out of his former position in the
line.
Judgment ajirmed.
