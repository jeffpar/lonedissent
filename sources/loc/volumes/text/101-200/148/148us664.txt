the same into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
proper district. The defendants here were not entitled to
such removal, and the decree, which was in favor of complainants and from which the defendants prosecuted this
appeal, must be reversed for want of jurisdiction, with costs
against the appellants, and the case remanded to the Circuit

IVEXIA v. OLIVER.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 182. Submitted March 23, 1893. -Decided

April 17, 1893.

In Texas, a married woman, who owns land in her own right, cannot convey
it by her husband, as her attorney, under a power of attorney from her
to him, without herself signing and acknowledging privily the deed,
although her husband joins in the deed individually.
Where a suit is brought in Texas by a married woman and her husband, to
recover possession of land, her separate property, and the petition is
endorsed with a notice that the action is brought as well to try title as for
damages, it is error to admit in evidence against the plaintiffls such a
power of attorney and deed, although there is an issue as to boundary
and acquiescence and ratification.
It does not appear beyond a doubt that such error could not prejudice the
rights of the plaintiffs.

THE case is stated m the opmon.

MEXIA u. OLIVER.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTion

BLATOHFORD

delivered the opinon of the court.

This is an action at law, brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Northern District of Texas, by Sarah
R. Mexia and her husband, Enrique A. Mexia, citizens of
Mexico, against T. J Oliver, a citizen of Texas, for the possession of a piece of land. The "first amended original petition" in the suit, filed November 30, 1888, is endorsed with a
notice to the defendant that the action is brought as well to
try title as for damages. The petition states that on January
1, 1878, the plaintiffs were seized and possessed in fee, in right
of said Sarah R. Mexia, of the following described tract of
land, situated in Limestone County, Texas, being some 4000
acres, more or less, out of 11 leagues of the land granted
originally to Pedro Varella, "beginmng at a stake and mound
on the eastern boundary of the Pedro Varella it-league grant,
2253 varas south, 450 east, from the northeast corner 6f said
li-league grant, said stake and mound being also the south-

east corner of a 6000-acre tract in the name of Jose M. Cabellero out of said 11-league grant, as the same was originally
surveyed and established in June, 1855, by G. H. Cunmngham,
surveyor, at the instance of E. A. Mexia, agent for J M.
Cabellero and plaintiffs' vendors, thence south 450 west with
(acthe south boundary line of said 6000-acre tract,
cording to a block of surveys made by G. H. Cunningham in
1856 in sectionizipg and subdividing said l-league grant, and
set apart to plaintiff Sarah R. Mexia by deed of partition
between Adelaide A. Hammekin, George L. l-ammekin,
Sarah R. Mexia and E. A. Mexia dated March 30, 1874;)"
thence proceeding with the boundary around said land to the
place of begining, "said boundaries including sections Nos.
1,2, 3, 4, 5, and a part of section No. 6, of the subdivision and
partition of the said Pedro Varella 11-league grant, as shown
on the records of the said Limestone County" The petition
sets forth also that on February 11, 1850, "Adelaide M. Hammekin, joined by her husband George L. Hammekin, being at
that time the owners of said 11-league grant, made, executed
and delivered to one Jose M. Cabellero a conveyance for 6000

acres of said 11-league grant, out of the northeast corner of
same, before any actual survey was made of said 6000-acre
tract, and that the same was never actually surveyed on the
ground until the month of June, .1855, at which time said
6000-acre tract was actually surveyed on the ground and cut
off from said 11-league grant, and the south or southwest
boundary line thereof was well established on the ground
in accordance with the field-notes as hereinbefore set forth,
and the same has ever since been held and regarded and acquiesced in as the south boundary of said 6000-acre tract and
as the division line between the same and the remainder of
said 11-league grant on the south and west thereof, and from
that time .to the present said line and survey has been acquiesced in by the adjacent owners of the land north and south
of said line", that said survey was made, and said line thus
established, by G. H. Cunningham, then surveyor of the land
district in which said land was situated, and this was done by
. Cabellero and the said
request and authority of said J
Hammekins, and said survey and lines were afterwards ratified, and ever since acquiesced in, by them and their vendees,
that such title as the defendant claims under is derived from
Cabellero under said conveyance for 6000 acres, that the
defendant will claim and insist in this cause that the south
boundary line of said 6000-acre tract, in the name of Cabellero,
should be at a point about 277 varas farther south than as
heretofore established and as claimed by the plaintiffs, that
on January 1, 1878, the defendant illegally entered on the
land and ejected the plaintiffs therefrom, to their damage m
the sum of $10,000, and that the land claimed is of the value
of $20,000. The petition prays judgment for the land, damages and costs, for a writ of possession, and for other relief.
The defendant filed a "first amended original answer" on
April 17, 1889, by which he demurred to the plaintiffs' first
amended original petition as insufficient in law, denied all the
allegations of the petition, pleaded not guilty, and alleged
that he had been in quiet, peaceable, continuous and adverse
possession for more than three years before the filing of the
suit, of so much of the land described in the petition as was

Opinion of the Court.

included within the boundaries following, to wit "In Limestone County, about 6 miles above the town of Springfield,
on the northern or left of the river Kavasota, being a part of
the 11-league grant by the States of Coahuila and Texas
to Pedro Varella, and commencing on the left bank of the
eastern (or northern) branch of the Navasota at the point
where the original line of said 11-league grant from the
second to the third corners crossed the said creek, thence
N. 450 E., following the original line of said 11-league grant,
to the original 3rd corner, thence S. 45Â°.E. two thousand five
hundred and thirty (2530) varas, following the original line of
the said 11-league grant, thence S.450 W., being a line parallel with the first line of this survey, to the left bank of the
Navasota, thence up said river to the beginning", that, as
to all not included in said boundaries, he did not set up any
claim, that he pleaded the. three-years and the five-years
statutes of limitation, that he and those whose estate he had
in the lands sued for had adverse .possession of the land
described in his plea of three years' limitation, for one year
next before the commencement of the suit, claiming the land
in good faith, that he and they had made permanent and
valuable improvements thereon, to the amount of $5000,
winch he asked to have valued and allowed to him under the
statute, and that, as to all land not included in the boundaries given in the answer, he made disclaimer.
The answer further alleged, that on July 27,1874, he purchased from Mrs. Maria Dolores Felicite Conti, the only
daughter and only heir of Jose M. Cabellero, the land described in the answer, paying therefor to her $5000 cash,
in gold, and received a deed, with said field-notes from her
and her husband J. M. Conti, that, if the Ilammekins and
said Cabellero ever agreed that the said 6000-acre tract should
be surveyed, and the same was so. surveyed as to make its
southern boundary 277 varas farther north than the southern
boundary as called for by said deed from the Hammekins to
Cabellero, and they afterwards acquiesced in and ratified the
same, which is not admitted but expressly denied, then the
defendant avers that, at and before the time he paid such

purchase money and received the deed from Mr. and Mrs.
Conti, he had no notice, actual or constructive, of such agreement, survey or ratification of the survey, nor that the Hammekins or the plaintiffs claimed any right to, or interest in,
said 6000-acre tract or any part thereof, as set out by metes
and bounds in the deed to Cabellero, that the defendant was
a bona flde purchaser for value of the land as so described,
and believed that he was acquiring the full and complete title
to the land as described in the deed to Cabellero, and believed
that he had a right to rely on the description of said land,
as set out in said deed, as correct, that on
, 187-, he
learned that Whitfield Scott claimed to have title to said land,
derived from the Hammekhns, and he purchased said title
from Scott, paying valuable consideration therefor, and without notice, actual or constructive, at the time he paid such
consideration or received his deed from Scott, that any one
else claimed title to any part of said laud, and without notice,
actual or constructive, of the agreement, survey or ratification
set out in the answer, that he received from Scott a deed
with the same field-notes as set out in said deed to Cabellero, and that, in purchasing from Scott, he was, as to the
claims set up by the plaintiffs, a bona ftde purchaser for a
valuable consideration.
The plaintiffs filed their "first supplemental petition," which
demurred to the defendant's first amended original answer,
filed April 17, 1889, as insufficient in law, and denied all the
averments contained in said answer, and in replication to the
defendant's averments and claims of title under the statutes
of limitation of three and five years, said that if the defendant had possession, under title or color of title, of any of the
land described in the petition, for three or five years before

the suit was instituted, (all 'of which the plaintiffs denied,)
such possession was no bar, because ever since the defendant
acquired title, color of title or possession, the plaintiff Sarah
R. Mlexia had been the lawful wife of the other plaintiff, and
had been a m.arried woman for ten years before the institution
of the suit, and for several years before the defendant acquired
any title, color of title or possession of any of the land de-

Opinion of the Court.

scribed in the petition, and that she was still such lawful
wife of her co-plaintiff. They prayed judgment as in their
petition.
N disposition appears to have been made of the demurrer
to the petition or the demurrer to the answer; but the case
was tried in April, 1889, before the court and a jury A verdict was found for the defendant, whereupon a'judgment was
entered that the plaintiffs take nothing by their suit., and that
the. defendant recover his costs, with execution upon either
the common property of the wife and the husband or the
separate property of the wife. The plaintiffs have sued out
a writ of error from this court.
There is a bill of exceptions, which sets forth that on the
trial the defendant offered to introduce in evidence a power
of attorney executed by Adelaide M. H=ammekmn to her husband, George L. Hammnekin, empowering him to dispose of,
in her name, certain real property belonging to her separately,
that the defendant also offered to introduce in evidence a
deed to the lands in controversy, made by said George L.
Hammekin, as attorney for his wife and personally for himself, in which deed he acted for his wife under said power of
attorney, and conveyed the 6000-acre Cabellero tract of land,
by metes and bounds, as 61aimed by the defendant, to Whitfield
Scott, on March 18, 1875, and a deed from Scott to the defendant, dated March 20, 1875, conveying the same land conveyed to Scott by George L. Hammekin for himself and wife,
and that the plaintiffs objected to the introduction of said
testimony, because "First. Said power of attorney did not
vest in the husband any -authority to act for the wife in
executing deeds to her separate property, such a power being
inconsistent with and in contravention of our statute requiring
the signature and privy acknowledgment of the wife joined
by her husband to convey such property 2d. The deed to
Whitfield Scott executed by George L. Hammekin, for himself and as attorney-m-fact for his wife, was without authority
of law, was not privily acknowledged by the wife, as is required in cases of the conveyance of the separate property
of the wife, and conveyed none of her title. 3d. The deed

from Whitfield Scott to defendant T. J Oliver, being based
upon the foregoing instruments, should.fail with them, and
was not evidence of any title." The court overruled the
objections and admitted the instruments in evidence, and the
plaintiffs excepted. After the verdict was rendered, the plaintiffs appear to have moved the court to set aside the Verdict
and to grant a new trial, for the following reasons "1. Said
verdict is contrary to the law in this case as given in charge
to the jury by the court, and is contrary to the evidence in
the case of all the legitimate positive testimony in the case
showing clearly and beyond a doubt that the lower line of
the Cabellero 6000-acre tract of land was actually run upon
the ground and marked off by the surveyor, G. HI. Cunnngham, in 1855, and that said line was subsequently acquiesced
in by said Cabellero and the ilammekins, the adjacent owners
of the lands on both sides of said line, as the true division
line between said tracts. 2. Because the court erred in admitting in evidence over plaintiffs' objections the power of
attorney made by Adelaide M. iammekin to her husband,
Geo. L. Hammekin, authorizing him to act for her in the sale
and disposition of her real property, and in admitting in evidence over plaintiffs' objection the deed from said Adelaide
M. Ilammekin, acting by her said husband as attorney-in-fact,
to Whitfield Scott, conveying the land here m controversy,
said power of attorney being in contravention of the policy
of our laws as decided by our courts, and said deed, under
our said decisions, being insufficient to. bind a married woman
or to convey her separate property, having never been privily
acknowledged by her. 3. The court erred in permitting the
defendant Oliver and the witness Roberts to testify as to
lengths of the various section lines of Pedro Varellw elevenleague section, said proof being wholly immaterial to the
ascertainment of whether a line had actually been run and
acquiesced in by the adjacent owners, as claimed by plaintiffs,
but, on the contrary, said proof tending to confuse the minds
of the jurors and cause them to consider whether plaintiffs
had their quantity of land in the various sections, instead of
the true location of the division lines between the Cabellero

tract and the balance of the eleven leagues."

The record

does not show that any disposition was made of that motion,
nor is it shown by the record why the court made the rulings
which it did make. We are furnished with a brief for the
defendant.
It is assigned as error that the court allowed the introduction m evidence of the power of attorney from Mrs. H-ammekin to her husband, of the deed to Scott by the latter,
acting for hnnself and as agent for his wife, and of the deed
from Scott to the defendant, because, "1, said power of attorney from Adelaide M. Hammekin to her husband, Geo. L.
Ilammekin, could not authorize him to act for her and as her
agent in conveying her separate property, said instrument
being void under the statute and decisions of Texas requiring
the privy acknowledgment of married women to transfers of
their separate real property, 2, the deed from Geo. L. Hammekin, acting for himself and wife, to W Scott, not being
signed by her and acknowledged by her privily and apart from
her said husband, did not, under said statute and decisions,
convey her separate property; and, 3, said deed from Scott
to defendant, being based on the foregoing invalid instruments, must fall with them."
The location of the south boundary line of the 6000-acre
tract, (out of the northeast corner of the 11-league grant to
Varella,) conveyed' by Ars. Hammekm and her husband in
1850 to Cabellero, appears to be the issue in the action, and
the defendant claims in accordance with the call in that deed.
The plaintiffs claim that, at the time of the sale of the land
to Cabellero, it had not been surveyed, that there -was no
survey of it until June, 1855, when it was surveyed and
marked on the ground by the Hammekins and Cabellero,
the south boundary line being at a distance of 2253 varas
south, 450 east, from the northeast corner of the 11-league
grant, and that the line thence south, 45 Â° west, was thereafter recognized by the Hammekins and Cabellero as the
true south boundary line of the. Cabellero tradt, and its- loca"tion there was acqiesced in by the then adjacent owners of the
lands, that the land south of that line. was sectionized for the

Hammekins in 1856, by Ounmngham, the same surveyor who
established the line for the Hammekms and Cabellero m 1855,
tuat, in sectionizing, he began section No. 1 at the southeast
corner of the Cabellero tract, at a point in the eastern boundary line of the 11-league grant, 2253 varas from the northeast
corner of that grant, and that all the sections lying south
of said 6000-acre tract, being sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and part of
6, were set apart to the plaintiffs by deed of partition between
them and the Ilammelans, dated March 30, 1874.
The defendant claims the 6000-acre tract in accordance
with the calls in the original deed conveying it from the H1ammekmns to Cabellero, in 1850, and alleges that he acquired
title to it, first, through the deed to him from Mrs. Cont
dated July 27, 1874, and, second, through the deed from the
Hammekins to Scott and that from Scott to the defendant,
dated respectively March 18 and 20, 1875.
Article 559 of Sayles' Civil Statutes of Texas reads as
follows "The husband and wife shall join in the conveyance
of real estate, the separate property of the wife, and no such
conveyance shall take effect until the same shall have been
acknowledged by her privily and apart from her husband
before some officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments to deeds for the purpose of being recorded and certified
to in the mode pointed out in chapter two, title lxxxvi
[title 86]." Title 86, chap. 2, art. 4310, provides as follows
No acknowledgment of a married woman to any conveyance
or other instrument purporting to be executed by her shall be
taken unless she has had the same shown to her, andthen and
there fully explained by the officer taking the acknowledgment, on an examination privily and -apart from her husband,
nor shall he certify to the same unless she thereupon acknowledges to such officer that the same is her act and deed, that
she has willingly signed the same, and that she wishes not
to retract it." Art. 4311 makes requirements as to the certificate, and Art. 4313 prescribes the form of certificate of
acknowledgment by a married woman.
Art. 559 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of
Texas in Cannon v Boutwell, 53 Texas, 626 and Peak v

NEXIA v. OLIVER.
Opinion of the Court.

Bn.mo, 71 Texas, 310. In the first case, the title of the
defendant depended, as it -does here, upon the validity of a
power of attorney executed and privily acknowledged by the
wife, authorizing the husband to sell and convey her separate
property, and the validity of a deed made by the husband
under the power, acting for himself and his wife, the deed being
executed by him without her privy acknowledgment thereof.
In its opinon, the court said "A deed or power of attorney,
signed by the wife alonei is not such an instrument as the
statute makes effective to pass her estate. The decisions
under similar statutes have been uniform in holding the separate conveyance of the wife invalid, notwithstanding it may
have been clearly shown that she acted with her husband's
assent," citing several decisions. The opinion further said
"The statute does not attempt to provide for either conveyances or powers of attorney from the wife to the husband, and
we think it would be a departure from the policy of the law,
wholly unauthorized by anything in the statute, to allow the
husband, by means simply of a general power of attorney from
the wife, to dispose of her separate estate at his will." Under
that decision, the power of attorney from Mrs. Hammekm to
her husband would appear to be ineffectual to pass to hun any
right to transfer her separate property, without her privy
acknowledgment of the deed, and the deed from Mr. Rammekin to Scott to be invalid. The same ruling was made m Peak
v Brvnson. The first case was in regard to instruments made
in 1856 and 1858, while the second case applied to instruments
made between 1870 and 1880.
We cannot say that these errors were immaterial, as it does
not appear beyond doubt that they were errors which could
not prejudice the rights of the plaintiffs. Deery v. Cray, 5
Wall. 795, 807, Gilmer v -liley,110 U S. 47, 50. The O;rcuit Court, by overruling the objections made to the instruments in question, virtually held that they gave the defendant
a valid title, and the evidence afforded by those instruments
may have had the effect upon the jury of disproving the
acquiescence of Mrs. Hammekin in the boundary line as claimed
by -the plaintiffs, while it does not appear that she knew anyVOL. CXLvIII-43
