:M. JUSTICE BLATOHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case, Frank Gates filed a petition in the court of
Claims, May 27, 1891, setting forth that from May 24, 1888,
to July 31, 1888, he was a letter-carrier in the post office at
the city of New York, of the class entitled to a salary of
$1000 a year; that during that period he was, from time to
time, actually and necessarily employed in excess of eight
hours a day, in the performance of the duties assigned to him
as such carrier, aggregating a specified excess; that by the act
of May 24, 1888, (set forth in case No. 1061, just decided, ante,
124,) he became entitled to extra pay for all the time during
which he was so employed, in excess of eight hours a day, that
he had applied to the Post Office Department for payment and
it had not been paid, and that he claimed judgment for a specified amount, besides costs. A traverse of the petition was filed
July 14, 1891, and the case was heard by the Court of Claims,
which, on the evidence, found the facts to be as follows

"H=e has received no extra pay for the excess.
"13. For the said period of time claimant performed only
fifteen hours of. service on the ten Sundays, and four hours
and thirty minutes on Decoration Day, and the same time on
the 4th day of July"
On such findings of fact, the court found as a conclusion of
law that. Gates was entitled to recover for the 165 hours and 9
minutes of extra work performed by him, without.being, required to deduct therefrom the deficit of less than eight hours.
a day worked on Sundays and holidays, as shown by finding
3, amounting, at 34.2 cents-per 'hour, to $56.48, and for that
amount a judgment was entered for him, to review which
the United States has appealed.
In the opinion of the Court of Claims, reported in.27 Ct. Cl.
244, 259, it is stated that No. 1061 (just decided) embraced,
with a single exception, all the questions presented by the
present case, No. 1060, besides many more questions; and that
No. 1060 presented one question which was not presented in
the other cases. That question is stated in the opinion as
follows: "On week days the carriers were employed more
than eight hours, but on Sundays less, and the deficit of the
latter nearly equals the excess of the former. The'Post Office
Department, by its circular February 19, 1891, has directed
postmasters ' To determine the time a letter-carrier may have

been required to work during any month in excess of eight
hours per day, as follows
"'Ascertain the aggregate hours worked during the month.
Multiply the number of days worked during the month by
eight, and subtract the product thus obtained from the aggregate number of hours worked, and the remainder will be the
extra time for which the carrier is entitled to pay at the following rates

"' The time necessarily consumed in the performance of the

service between "Report for duty" and "End of duty" is the
"actual time" to be allowed, and the interim between deliveries is the carrier's own time, and cannot in any case be
charged against the United States.'
"The carrier's eight-hour law declares ' that hereafter eight
hours shall constitute a day's work,' but it allows compensation to continue in the form of an annual salary, and requires
no deduction to be made if the duties of the day do not extend
through the prescribed time. It also declares that Iif any
letter-carrier is employed a greater number of hours per day
than eight he shall be paid extra for the same.' To sustain
the interpretation given to the act by the department, it will
be necessary to read in it by construction the words 'on an
average,' 11.e., if any letter-carrier is employed on an average
a greater number of hours per day than eight, he shall be paid
extra for the same. This the court is not at liberty to do.
The carrier is entitled to eight hours' work, and to his pay if
work is not furnished to him. For any excess on any day he
is entitled to extra pay The only set-off that can be maintained is when he is absent from duty without leave. The
department is at liberty to keep a carrier employed eight hours
