CASEMENT V. BROWN.
Syllibus.

The cases relied upon to sustain this decree do not touch
this question, and the authorities which require corporations
to be made parties to a bill against the stockholders, have no
application to cases in which it is not only useless but impossible to make them parties. I do not think the defendants in
this case, "who are charged with receiving the proceeds of a
gross fraud, should be permitted to take refuge in the shadow
of these defunct corporations.
M . JUSTICE GRAY was not present at the argument, and
took no part in the decision of this case.

CASEMENT v. BROWN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 173. 'Submitted March 24,1893.-Decided April 10, 1893.

A contractor agreed with a railroad company to construct piers for a bridge
over the Ohio River of sizes and forms, in places, and of materials, in
accordance with plans and specifications furnished by the company, and
to furnish the materials and perform the work of preparing and keeping
in place, buoys and lights to warn against danger. By reason of a flood
one of these piers was submerged, and the buoy and light placed to give
warning of it were carried away. The contractors failed to place a new
buoy and light. One of the barges in a tow struck on the pier and was
lost. In an action against the contractor to recover damages therefor,
HeZd,
(1) That the defendants were independent contractors, and not employ~s
of the company; and as such were liable for injuries caused by
their own negligence;
(2) That having omitted to replace the buoy, although they knew of
the necessity therefor and had ample time to do so, or otherwise
to warn of the danger, they were guilty of negligence, and responsible for injuries resulting therefrom,
(3) That there was no contributory negligence on the part of those navigating the vessel destroyed, as it would be placing too severe a
condemnation on the conduct of the pilots in charge to hold that
an error of judgment, a dependence upon the appearance of the
stream and a reliance upon the duty of the contractors to place
suitable buoys and other warnings, were snch contributory negligence 'as would relieve the contractors from liability.

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

TEis was an action to recover the value of three barges of
coal, lost, as claimed, through the negligence of the defendants. The case was commenced in the Court of Common
Pleas of Scioto County, Ohio, and removed to the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio.
There it was tried by the court without a jury; findings of
fact were made, and from those findings the conclusion was
reached that the defendants were guilty of negligence.
Whereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs
for the amount of the loss.
These facts appeared in the findings Early in the year of
1882, two railroad corporations, one an Ohio and the other a
West Virginia corporation, obtained proper authority from
those States and from the United States government for the
construction of a railroad bridge across the Ohio River,
opposite the village of Point Pleasant, in West Virginia.
The plan of the bridge and the number and size of the stone
piers were submitted to the proper officers of the United
States government, and approved, and the bridge and piers
were duly constructed as authorized by such officers.
"There were six stone piers provided and built for the
support of said bridge, one of which stood on top of the bluff
bank of the river on the West Virginia side, another on top
of the bluff bank on the Ohio side, and the other four between said banks of the river. Said four piers between the
banks are known as 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' Said pier 'A,' being
on the West Virginia side of the river, was located and built
at the outer edge of low-water mark, pier 'B,' 250'feet west
therefrom, pier 'C ,' 250 feet west of pier ' B,' and pier ID I at
the edge of the water at low-water mark on the Ohio side,
at the distance of 500 feet from said pier 'C, the west side
of pier 'A' and the east side of'pier 'D' reaching to the edge
of the water at low-water mark. The long span between
piers 'C' and 'D' was duly established as the channel span
after notice duly given and consultation with those engaged
in the navigation of the Ohio River, as required by law"
On January 27, 1882, these corporations entered into a
written contract with the defendants for furnishing the ma-

Statement of the Case.

terial and building these piers. This contract in terms provided that defendants were "to furnish all material of every
kind, name and description necessary for the construction of
the same, said material to be. subject to. the approval of said
engineer and to be of such quality as may best insure the
durability of said structure, to be at the expense of and
subject to all expenses incident to and connected with said
work of construction, the said work to be done and completed
according to the plan and specifications hereto annexed,,
marked A, and subject to the inspection and approval of
the said engineer of said companies in charge of said work,
and which said plans and specifications are hereby expressly
.made a part of this contract." It further provided that "the
work throughout will be executed in the most thorough, substantial and workmanlike manner, under the direction and
supervision of the engineer of the company, who will give
such directions from time to time during the construction
of the work as may appear to him necessary and proper to
make the work complete in all respects, as contemplated in
the foregoing specifications. Said directions of the engineer
will in all respects be complied with. The engineer will alsd
have full power to reject or condemn all wokk or materials
which, in his opinion, do not conform to the spirit of the foregoing specifications, and shall decide every question that may
arise between the parties relative to the execution of the work,
and his decision in the nature of an award shall be final and
conclusive on both parties to this contract."
Under this contract the defendants had, at the time of the
injury, completed the two piers on the banks, and partly constructed the four piers between the banks. For two weeks
before the injury the river had been rising rapidly, and the
water was very high. Business on the river had been partially
suspended on account thereof. On the Ohio side the bank was
under water, which extended inland a quarter of a mile or
more. The stage of the water in the river was then fifty-five
feet above low-water mark. Three of the piers were from
thirty-seven to forty-seven fdet below the surface of the water,
while pier "D" on the Ohio side, which had been completed

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

to forty-eight feet above lowwater mark, was covered to the
depth of only about seven feet.
"5. There is a very slight curve in the river at Point Pleasant, the Ohio shore being on the convex side, and at high
stages of water it is customary and proper for coal fleets to
'run the points,' running near the shore on the Ohio side at a
distance of a quarter of a mile and more above the bridge in
descending the river and bearing out to the left of channel
pier D and between channel pier D and 0 and running in near
the shore on the West Virginia side about two miles below
said village of Point Pleasant, and the channel of the river was
between said channel piers 0 and D, and the usual and proper
course was to run between said piers 0 and D, running the
points as before stated.
"6. The night before the accident, the plaintiffs' three
steamboats- the 'Resolute,' the 'Alarm,' and the 'Dexter'
- with coal barges in tow, tied to shore during the night some
distance above the bridge.
"The 'Resolute,' with its tow, was in advance of the other
two, passing the bridge on the morning of the accident br tween
eight and nine o'clock. The 'Alarm,' with its tow, reached
the bridge about 10 o'clock in the morning. Its tow consisted
of six coal barges, three abreast, each barge being twenty-six
feet wide and drawing between seven and eight feet of water.
The front middle barge ran upon and struck said channel pier
D, which caused the injury complained of.
"The steamer 'Dexter,' with its tow, passed shortly after
between said channel piers ) and D, where the 'Resolute,'
with its tow, had previously passed, and while one of the
'Alarm's' barges that struck said pier D was still lying on
said pier in plain view
"7. The morning of the, accident was clear and calm, and
the Alarm, with its tow, was steaming and handling well. The
pilot in charge was well acquainted with the Ohio River at
that point and from Pittsburg to all points below, and while
the work of constructing said pier was going -on had passed
there twice a week and saw and -knew where said piers were
located and to what extent the work had progressed and where

CASEM-ENT v. BROWN.
Statement of the Case.

the channel span had been established and its length,and also
knew that prior to the location of said bridge the usual channel for coal fleets in passing down the river was further to the
left, between piers B and C and near to said pier B.
"8. As the Alarm approached the bridge no halt was made
nor was any one sent forward in a skiff or otherwise to take
observations or make inquiry The pier standing on the Ohio
bank, twenty-four feet-out of water, was in plain view and was
seen by said pilot and others in the pilot-house, and the same
was the case as to the pier on the east bank of the river.
"The village of Point Pleasant and its buildings, well known
to pilots and other rivermen, were also in plain view
"There were also on the Ohio side, between the top of the
bank, both above and below the bridge, growing trees, the
tops of which were some distance out of water, -that-were in
plain view and were noticed by said pilot, but for the distance
of about a quarter of a mile immediately above and below said
bridge the line of trees did not extend. At the time'df the
accident there were present in the pilot-house, aiding and
assisting the pilot in charge, the other pilot of the Alarm and
three other pilots, who were on the lookout, making observations and consulting as to the passage of the bridge, none of
whom saw any buoys or break to' indicate where the pier was.
Another man acted%as lookout, was on the extreme front of
the tow, and he saw 1o buoys or break to indicate the location
of said- pier D.
"9. During the building of saitd four piers between tht
banks of the river proper buoys had been kept upon the same,
to which, during the night, proper lights had been attached as.
signals to warn passing boats and other water craft of danger;
but for some days .prior to the accident, on, account of the
height of the water and the large quantity of floating drift;
the buoys had been carried off and floated down the river, but
had been secured and replaced till the night preceding the
accident or the night previous to that, when the buoy on pier
D had again been washed off and had not been replaced at the
time of the accident, and the fact of its-absence was known to
the defendants early in the morning of the accident, and they

Statement of the Case.

made no effort to restore it till after the accident, and that they
might have done so, neither did they send any one up the
river or adopt any other plan, as they might have done, to
notify approaching boats of the absence of said buoy, or adopt
any other plan.
"10. The said railroad companies provided, employed and
paid for the services of a chief and an assistant engineer to
superintend said work, one of whom was at all times on the
ground and gave directions as to the mode and manner of
constructing said stone piers and decided as to the quantity of
stone, the height and size and shape of the piers, and performed
all the duties specified in said written contract. Said railroad
companies, through said engineers as their agents, duly authorized, took charge of, directed and controlled as to providing
buoys and lights to be kept upon said piers, the character of
the same and the mode and manner of fastening them-to said
piers and keeping them in place. Said engineers of said railroad company, however, on behalf of said railroad company,
employed the defendants to furnish the materials and perform
the work in preparing said buoys and lights, and in putting
them up and in keeping them in place when and as directed
by said engineers. The defendants were paid for said materials
and work, an account of which was kept by defendants and
was carried into their monthly bills with the stone-work, and
was settled and paid for with the other work.
"Pridr to said accident said engineers had given to the
defendants such directions as to the character of such buoys
to be used, and as to the mode and manner of putting them
and keeping them up, and it was the duty of defendants to see
that they were kept up and replaced when washed away,
under said instructions previously given and without waiting for future instructions, and which they had undertaken
to do."
Upon these facts, the court fdand as conclusions of law
"1. That.the defendants, by the terms of said written agreement-made with said railroad companies, .are independent
contractors, and are liable to the. plaintiffs for the injury
complained of.

CASEMENT v. BROWN.
Opinion-of the Court.

"2. That the agreement made by defendants with said railroad companies to furnish the material and do the work in
preparing, putting up and keeping up said buoys and lights
on said piers created the relation of independent contractors,
and made the defendants liable to the plaintiffs for the injury
complained of.
"3. That it was the duty of defendants to have kept a buoy
upon said pier D, and if washed off by drift or otherwise to
have replaced it, or, if this could not have been done, on the
morning of the accident, before the injury, they could and
should have sent some one up the river a sufficient -distance
above the bridge, or adopted some other plan, to notify
approaching boats of the loss of such buoy and of the location
of the piers, and their failure to do so constitutes negligence
on their part, and under such circumstances those in charge
of plaintiffs' coal boats were not chargeable with negligence in
failing to make accurate calculations as to the location of said
pier D from the other objects n view and seen by them or
that they might have seen.
"4. That the plaintiffs and their agents in charge of the
tow were at the time in the exercise of reasonable and proper
care in the management and navigation of the tow, and were
not guilty of contributory negligence, that at the time of the
accident the plaintiff ' boat Alarm, with its coal tow, was in
the usual and prope place of navigation at that stage of
water."
Judgment having been entered in accordance with these
findings and conclusions, defendants sued out a writ of error

The defendants contend First, that they were not independent contractors, but employes of the railroad companies,

Opinion of the Court.

and that, therefore, the railroad companies and not themselves
were responsible for any negligence, second, that they were
not.guilty of any negligence, and, third, that if they were,
the plain tiffs were also guilty of contributory negligence, and
therefore debarred from any recovery
With reference to the first contention Obviously, the
defendants were independent contractors.
The plans and
specifications were prepared and settled by the railroad companies, the size, form and place of the piers were determined
by them, and the defendants contracted to build piers of the
prescribed form and size and at the places fixed. They
selected their own servants and employes. Their contract
was to produce a specified result. They were to-furnish all
the material and do all the work, and by the use of that
material and the means of that work were to produce the completed structures. 'The will of the companies was represented
only in the result of the work, and not in the means by which
it was accomplished. This gave to the defendants the status
of independent contractors, and that- status was not affected
by the fact that, instead of waiting until the close of the work
for acceptance by the engineers of the companies, the contract
provided for -their daily supervision and approval of, both
material and work. The contract was not to do such work as
the engineers should direct, but to furnish suitable material
and construct certain specified and described piers, subject to
the daily approval of the companies'.engineers. This constant
right of supervision, and this continuing duty of satisfying
the judgment of the engineers, do not ailter the fact that it
was a contract to do a particular work, and in accordance
with plans.and specifications already prepared. They did not
agree to enter generally into the service of the companies, and
do whatsoever their employers called upon them to do, but
they contracted for -only a specific work. The functions of
the engineers were to see that they complied with this contract-" only this, and nothing more." They were to see
that the thing produced and the result obtained were such as
the contract provided for. Carman, v Steubenville & Indiana

Nills, 27 Connecticut, '274, Wood on -Master and -Servant,
610, § 314.
'It is unnecessary to inquire whether because of- the supervision retained by the companies through their engineers, or
because the work which was done was work done-on a public
highway, the companies might also be responsible for any
negligence in the progress of the work. 2 Dillon on 1uriicipal Corporations, 4th ed., § 1030, Cleveland v Jifng;132 U. S.
295, -Checago v Robbns, 2 Black, 418, Robbns v. Ckwago, 4
Wall. 657, 11ater Company v.. Ware, 16 Wall. 566. It is
enough for this case that these defendants contracted to do
the work, and to produce a finished structure according to
certain plans and specifications, and having miade such contract, and engaged in such work in accordance therewith, they
are retponsible for all injuries resulting from their own negligence. While doubtless the original written -contract would
cast upon the defendants as contractors the duty of taking all
reasonable precaution, by buoys or otherwise, to warn those
travelling on this public highway of any -danger arising from
their work, yetin addition, it 'appears that thele was a special
contract by which they agreed to- furnish the material and
perform the work of preparing and -keeping in place- buoys
and lights to warn against all danger. Surelr, having made
a contract to do the entire work, and in addition a special
agreement to keep proper buoys and lights in place to warn
persons of danger, it does not lie in their mouths to say that
their negligence and omission of this contractual duty cast no
responsibility upon themselves, but was only the negligence and
omission of duty of the railroad companies, for which the
latter, and the latter alone, were responsible.
Secondly, equally clear is it that they were guilty of negligence in failing to replace the-buoy over this submerged pier.
According to the findings, they knew that that which had
been there had been carried away, and had ample time to put
another in its place. They knew of the submerged pier, and
of the danger to boats therefrom, they knew what was necessary to guard against that danger, for they- had prevously
been taking the proper precautions. Having omitted to'ieplace

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

the buoy, although they knew of the necessity therefor and
had ample time to do so, or otherwise to warn of the danger,
they were guilty of negligence, and responsible for all injuries
which resulted therefrom.
But the stress of this case arises on the third of their contentions, and that is, that the plaintiffs were guilty of contributory
negligence. It is said that the river was so high that it was
dangerous to attempt to run a steamboat with barges down
the current, that the piers on the shores, on either side, were
visible, and in fact seen by the pilots, and thus they knew the
line on which were placed the then submerged piers in the
river, thatI they were familiar with the river at this place,
knew that a bridge was being constructed, and during its construction had passed there twice a week, and saw and knew
where the piers were located, and to what extent the work
had progressed, that the day was clear, and the steamer under
control, steaming and handling well, and that although approaching where they knew were these partially constructed
piers, and seeing that they were submerged, no halt was made,
nor any one sent forward to take observations or make inquiry
In view of these facts, it is strenuously urged that the pilots
and officers of the steamboat were guilty of negligence which
contributed directly to the injury, and that, therefore, the
plaintiffs, being responsible for the negligence of their agents
and emploves, cannot recover. It nust be conceded that these
facts, thus grouped. together, poriit in the direction of negligence on the part of the pilots and officers. They knew that
there was danger there, and, therefore, were bound to take suitabi .precautions to guard against it, they knew that pier "D"
was i-ar the Ohio shore, and that its construction had progressMf further than that of the other piers, and still they did
not direct the course of -the boat away from that shore, and
into the unobstructed channel.
On the other hand, it must be observed that the mere fact
of high water does not establish negligence on the part of the
plaintiffs. Indeed, as water is a necessity for and means of
steamboat navigation, it would seem that the more water the
less danger. If it be said that the increased volume of water

CASEMENT v. BROWN.
Opmion of the Court.

increases the current, and, therefore, the difficulty of controlling the motions of the vessel, it is enough to say that the findings -show that there was no difficulty or danger in this case
on that account. The injury resulted from a submerged obstruction, and the more water there is, apparently the less
danger from such sources. It is true, the findings state that
business on the river was partially suspended on account of
the high water. That may have been because prudent men
were unwilling to risk the dangers arising therefrom, or because everything on the river driven by steam power was
needed to prevent the high water from carrying away personal property along the shore, and to collect that which was
being borne away Whatever may have been the reasons,
the fact that business was only partially suspended is satisfactory evidence that 'it
was not in and of itself negligence for
these plaintiffs to attempt to run their boats down the river.
If it be said that the pilots ought to have taken the boats
farther out into the channel, it is sufficient answer that it is
found as a fact that it was both customary and proper for coal
fleets, such as these, to keep somewhat near the Ohio shore at
this place, "running the points," as the expression is, and the
fact that, in this case, they miscalculated the exact location of
the submerged pier does not subject them to the condemnation
of negligence. It seems from this finding that they were pursuing the proper as -%*ell as the customary course, and a -mere
error of judgment is not; under such circumstances, iegligence.
While it is true the findings state that the pilots knew where
the piers were located, and to what extent the work had progressed, having been in The habit of passing there twice a week
during the construction, yet it is not to be assumed therefrom
that the court meant to find that these -pilots knew the exact
height to which pier "D" had been carried, the exact stage of
the water at the time, and, therefore, the exact depth of the
water above the pier, and also its exact location in the river.
All that can reasonably be inferred from the language is, that
they possessed such knowledge of the location and construction
of the piers as they would acquire from passing up and down
the river twice a week in boats. And in reviewing a judgment
VOL. CXLVIII-40

OCTOBER TERI

Opinion of the, Court.

it is not proper to place any narrow, strained or strict con.
struction on the language with which the court describes its
findings of fact, in order to sustain the contention that they
do not support the conclusions of law and the judgment. On
the contrary, if any reasonable and fair construction thereof
will sustaan the judgment, such construction should be recognized and adopted by the appellate court as the true construction. If it be said that, knowing, as they did, that somewhere
in the line between the two shore piers was this submerged
pier "D," they should have ascertained for a certainty its
exact position before proceeding on their cpourse, it may be replied that the fact that this was an artificial obstruction, placed
there by parties still engaged in the construction of a bridge
across the river, and, therefore, having a present duty of caring for the structures and seeing that no one was injured
thereby, is a fact of significance. If it was a natural obstruction, one in respect to which no party had any duty of preservation or warning, it might be that the obligation resting upon
the pilots would be of a different and more stringent character.
But, they knew. that here a great work was being constructed
by these defendants, that it was their duty to give all needful
warning to persons and boats going up and down the river;
and that, if there were no buoys in place or other warning
given,, they might fairly conclude that all of these piers were
so far submerged as to threaten no danger to passing boats.
Further, as appears from the findings, they saw no break in
the water, nothing which would indicate that the top of the
submerged pier was near the surface, And still further, one
of the boats in the fleet had but shortly before passed there in
safety They evidently relied on two facts- First, that the
course they were taking mdiappearance of the water in t
cat@d that the pier, if in-thut course, was so far 6ubmerged as
to threaten no danger; and, secondly, that if there were any
danger to be apprehended from such an obstruction, the parties
in charge of the work would have indicated by buoys or otherwise the place of the danger. Shall they-be condemned because
they relied upon the defendants' faithful discharge of the duty
of giving suitable warning, and in the absence of such warning
