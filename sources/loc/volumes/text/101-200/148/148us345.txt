No. 64. Argued December 21, 22, 1892.-becided March 27,1893.

When one party to a special contract not under seal refuses to perform his
side of the contract, or disables himself from performing it by his own
act, the other party has thereupon a right to elect to rescind it, and may,
on doing so, immediately sue on a quantum meruit for anything he had
done under it previously to the rescission.
This doctrine was supported by the Supreme Court of the Territory of
Washington in this case, and is now sustained by this court, notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington
in Distler v. Dabney, 23 N. W Rep. 335, construing the code of that State
adversely to it.

ject to reversal because of decisions made in subsequent cases by the
courts of the State, after its admission, while the former cases were
pending on appeal in this court.
Defects in the pleadings in this case, if any, not having been questions
below, cannot operate here to invalidate the trial there.
A title derived from a land grant railroad company which has not received
a patent, by reason of failure to pay the costs of surveying, is not a title
winch a party who has contracted for a deed of the land and has paid
the purchase price therefor, is obliged to accept.
When a contract is entered into to convey and to purchase a tract of land,
and title fails as to part of it, the purchaser may rescind the contract as
to all.
When part of a contract of purchase of land is that the purchaser shall
assume and pay a mortgage thereon, if the title to a part of it fails he
may rescind the contract 'without paying the mortgage.
When a contract to coivey land permits the purchaser to enter and occupy,
and he does so and makes the payments prescribed by the contract, and
the seller falls to convey by the agreed title, the seller cannot, in an
action by the purchaser to recover back the purchase money, set up as
an offset a claim for the rent of the land during the buyer's occupancy.
IT appears from the record in this case that on October 20,
1882, at Walla Walla, in Washington Territory, Levi Ankeny,
the plaintiff in error, entered into a contract with Van Buren
Clark, the defendant in error, by which Ankeny agreed to sell
and convey to Clark two quarter sections of land in Walla
Walla County in consideration of 12,000 bushels of wheat, to
be delivered in three annual instalments of 4000 bushels each,
and of the assumption by Clark of a mortgage of $3000 on
the land. This contract was evidenced by three written instruments as follows
1. A bond from Ankeny to Clark in the penal sum of
$10,000 conditioned to convey the land to Clark upon his
paying the consideration according to agreement.
2. A "wheat note" from Clark to Ankeny, which reads as
follows:
"WALLA. WALLA,

W T., Oct. 20, 1882.

"For value received I promise to pay to Levt Ankeny or
order twelve thousand (12,000) bushels of good, merchantable
wheat, said wheat to be delivered to the owner of this note at
any railroad station in Walla Walla County, Washmgton Ty.,

Statement of the Case.

and payments to be made as follows On or before Oct. 15th,
1883, four thousand (4,000) bushels, on or before Oct. 15th,
1884-, four thousand (4,000) bushels, and on or before Oct.
15th, 1885, four thousand (4,000) bushels, the owner of this
note to furnish sacks for said wheat."
3. A chattel mortgage from Clark to Ankeny to secure the
payment of the wheat note.
Under this agreement, Clark entered into possession of the
land and continued in possession of it until the fall of 1886.
In performance of this contract, Clark, in December, 1883,
delivered to Ankeny 4167 bushels of wheat, and in September,
1885, he delivered 8600 bushels, making 767 bushels more than
the contract called for. Ankeny accepted this wheat in fulfilment of the contract.
After the delivery of the wheat to Ankeny, Clark demanded
a deed for the land. This Ankeny neglected to give, putting
Clark off from time to time upon one pretext or another, until
Clark, becoming impatient, finally insisted either upon a deed
to the land or payment for his wheat. Clark was then referred by Ankeny to the latter's attorneys, who informed him
that he could have a warranty deed to the quarter on the even
section and a quitclaim deed to the quarter on the odd section, or the railroad land, as it- was called, and they further
informed him that if the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
should not get title to the odd section and he should be obliged
to procure title from the government, Ankeny would pay the
necessary expenses of obtaining title in that way This does
not seem to have satisfied Clark, and on November 16, 1886,
he served upon Ankeny the following notice
W T., Nov. 16, 1886.
'Levi Ankeny Esq., Walla Walla, W T.
" DEAnF Sin I have performed my part of the contract in
the purchase- of the land described in your bond to me. I
have learned that you have-no title to one hundred and sixty
acres of it. You have reftsed to give me anything more than
a quit-'claim deed to this part of the land. I cannot accept

such a deed. It was not what the contract called for. Unless
within five days from this date you convey a perfect title to
me to the whole of the land described in the bond by a good
and sufficien7t conveyance I will, at the end of that time,
abandon this land and surrender the possession to you and
look to you for such compensation as the law allows me on
account of violation of the contract.
V B. CLAMI:."
"Resp'y,
Ankeny seems to have paid no attention to this notice, and
Clark, several days thereafter, taking a witness with him, went
to Ankeny's bank and formally surrendered possession of the
land to Ankeny Clark then abandoned possession of the
land and has not occupied it since.
Subsequently to all this, and on the 19th day of March,
1887, Clark brought this action in the District Court of the
First District to recover from Ankeny the value of 12,767
bushels of wheat delivered under the contract. The case was
tried before a jury, who. upon the direction of the court, brought
in a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment was given upon the
verdict.
The defendant took the case in error to the Supreme Court
of the Territory of Washington, which affirmed the judgment
of the District Court. The case is now before this court on
error to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Washington.

III. In order to rescind a contract for the sale of land on
the ground that the vendor cannot perform it because he has
no title to the land, it is necessary for the vendee to aver and
show an outstanding paramount title in another; Thayer v..

There is no averment in the pleadings of a paramount title
in the United States, or in any other person, nor is there any
evidence to support such an averment, had it been made.
1The Supreme Court of the territory, it will be observed,
basel its ruling on the doctrine laid down by this court, first,
in the case of Railway Co. v. P-resecott, 16 Wall. 603, approved
,in Railway Co. v .McShane, 22 Wall. 444, 462, and adhered
to in Northern Pazlft Railroad v Taill County, 115 U. S.
600.
All that can possibly be claimed for the principle enunciated
in these cases, and all ever intended by this court, it is
respectfully submitted, is simply this that until the company has complied with the provisions of the above proviso
and paid into the Treasury of the United States the cot
of surveying, selecting and conveying the lands claimed,
the United States may withhold the ejidence of a legal
title already vested in virtue of a present grant, in order to
protect its lien for the cost of surveying, selecting.and conveying the lads, and .that in such case, until patent does issue,
the lands shall not be subject to state or territorial taxation.

But the rule does not affect a case like this, where it appears affirmatively that the lands have been earned by the
construction of the road and its acceptance, and that the party
derives title through a deed from the railroad company, and it
is not shown that the costs of survey have not been paid.

VI. The pleadings are destitute of any allegation as to the
rescission of the contract, and no rescission by agreement is
proven. The evidence is conflicting, but plaintiff's evidence,
if uncontradicted, would not establish an agreement to rescind.

404, S. C. 100 Am. Dec. 301, Thurston v. Ludwzg, 6 Ohio St.

whether plaintiff had complied with his part of the contract, as
also whether there was a rescission of the same, were questions
of fact for the jury under the instructions of the court, and it
was grave error in the court in directing a verdict for plaintiff.

contract was of the value of $2127. If the plaintiff is entitled
in this action to rescind the contract, or treat it as rescinded,
and recover the value of the wheat paid on the contract, he
should deduct the value of that which he received under it.

John B. Allen for defendant in error.

MR.

JUSTICEg

Sirms, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Numerous errors have been assigned to the rulings of the
court below The first has to do with a question of, pleading.
The plaintiff declares in assumpsit for the -value of a certain
amount of wheat by the plaintiff sold and delivered to the
defendant. To this the defendant answered, setting up the
execution of a so-called wheat note and a chattel mortgage to
secure it, and alleging that "all the wheat delivered to defendant by plaintiff was delivered and received as payment on said
note and not otherwise." In this an'swer no mention was
made of any contract for the sale of land. The plaintiff, by
way of replicatipn, made a full statement of the contract for
the sale of the land, alleging performance on his part, and
default on the part of the defendant. :He averred that' after
lie, the plaintiff, had so performed said contract by the delivery of the wheat to the defendant, he duly demanded that
defendant should convey the land to the plaintiff, as by\his
bond he had undertaken to do, that the defendant neglected
and refused so to do, and still neglected and refused to grant
and convey said land to the plaintiff by any good and sufficient deed, and that said defendant had no title to one parcel
of the land described in the bond, and that since the maki-ng
of the contract defendant was not the owner or seized in fee or

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

at all of said land. He further alleged that the wheat mentioned in his complaint or declaration, except an excess thereof
over the requirements of said bond, was the purchase price of
the land, and that, by reason of defendant's neglect and
refusal and inability to perform the said contract, the defendant became and was indebted to plaintiff for the reasonable
value of said wheat, and that such demand constituted the
cause of action in the complaint pleaded.
In disposing of the contention of the plaintiff m error that
the pleadings disclose a departure by the plaintiff below from
the cause of action set f6rth in his complaint, and a resort to a
new and different cause of action in his replication, we are, of
course, entitled to regard the allegations of fact contained in
the complaint and rep:lication as true.
It would, therefore, appear that there was a contract
whereby the defendant below was to grant and convey unto
the plaintiff certain tracts of land by a good and sufficient
deed of conveyance, in consideration whereof the plaintiff was
to deliver to the defendant twelve thousand bushelsof wheat,
that the plaintiff performed his part of the contract by delivering the said wheat, which was received by the defendant,
that the plaintiff thereupon demanded of the defendant a conveyance of the land, that defendant neglected and refused to
grant and convey said tracts of land by any good or sufficient
deed, and that, as to one of the tracts, the defendant had no
title to convey
Upon such a state of facs it seems plain that the plaintiff
had a right to treat the contract as at an end, and to bring an
action to recover the value of the wheat he had delivered to
the defendant, and such other damages as he might liave suffered by reason of that failure of the latter to perform his part
of the -contract, and, a fortiorz, that he mi,;ht waive any
demand lor consequential damages, and confine his claim to
a demand for the value of the wheat. In the latter event he
might well assert his claim by a count alleging the delivery
and receipt of the wheat, a consequent duty on the defendant
to pay its value, and a demand for the same.
Under the ordinary system of pleadings, an action of

AKENY v. CLARK.
Opmion of the Court.

assumpsit would lie to recover back purchase money paid
upon a contract of sale which has been rescinded.
Smith expresses the.doctrine, in his note to Cutter v. Powell,
('2 Leading Cases, 30, 7th American edition,) thus
"It is an invariably true proposition that whenever one of
the parties to a special contract not under seal has, in an
unqualified manner, refused to perform his side of the contract, or has disabled himself from performing it by his own
act, the other party has thereupon a right to elect to rescind
it, and may, on doing- so, immediately sue on a quantum
meruit for anything he had done under it previously to the

rescission.,,
The learned author sustains his proposition by citing Withers v. Reynolds, 2 B. & Ad.. 882, Planchc v. Co/7hu, 8 Bing.
14, Palmerv. Temple, 9 Ad. & El. 508.
Well-considered American eases are to the same effect.

Rawle, 26, Baston v Cliford, 68 Illinois, 64, Staheli& v.
owe, 87 M,[ichigan, 12-4.
It is however, contended that, under the code of Washington, a different rule prevails, and the case of D?,stZer v Dabney,
23 N. W Rep. 335, decided by the Supreme Court of that
State, is cited. That decision was made after the trial of the
present case, and while the appeal from the Supreme Court of
the Territory of Washington was pending in this court, -but it
is claimed that, under the doctrine of Stutsman, County v.
W1allace, 142 U. S.293, when, pending an appeal from a territorial court to the Supreme Court of the *UnitedStates upon a
question of local law, the Territory isadmitted as a State, and
the Supreme Court of the new State reaches an opposite conclusion upon the same question, the later decision will be
followed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
It does, indeed, appear that, in the case of Dzstler v
.Dalney, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington has
construed the code of that State as meaning that the plaintiff's
complaint must contain his real cause of action, and that he
cannot be permitted to meet matter set up in the answer by
resorting, in his replication, to a new cause of action inconsistvoL. cxL.vx-23

OCTOBER TERMI, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

ent with the statement made in the complaint. The facts of
that case were not dissimilar to those of the case in hand, and
it must be conceded that, if we are bound to adopt the construction put by the Supreme Court of the State on the code
of the State as applicable to the code of the Territory, notwithstanding an opposite view of the Supreme Court of the Territory, it would lead to a reversal of the judgment in this case,
unless, indeed, the. objection was waived by the subsequent
conduct of the defendant.
It would seem to be altogether unreasonable that the judgments of territorial courts, in mere matters of procedure,
should be subject to reversal, because of decisions made by the
courts of the State in subsequent cases, while the former cases
were pending on appeal in this court. Nor do we understand
the case of Stutsman County v Wallace to so hold. In that
case there were involved a substantive right to an estate and a
construction of the tax laws of the State and Territory, and it
was pointed out, in the reasoning of this court, that our mandate must be issued to the Supreme Court of the State, which,
in its turn, directs the state court succeeding to the District
Court of the Territory to proceed in conformity to our judgment, and it would seem to irresistibly follow that, in the enforcement-of a law common to the Territory and to the State,
this court must, in pursuance of the well-settled rule, adopt the
construction put upon the local statute by the highest court of
the State.
The distinction between that and the present case is obvious.
The question before the territorial courts in the particular we
are now considering, involved no substantive right, but a mere
matter of orderly procedure in the trial court, and we are satisfiect with the ruling of the Supreme Court of the Territory
that the District Court did not err in regarding the facts set
up in the replication as properly pleaded to the matters alleged
in the answer, and as not, in substance, a departure from the
complaint.
The course of the District Court at the trial was approved
by the Supreme Court of the Territory, and surely cannot now
be impugned, because, in a later and different case, arising in

ANKIENY

v. CLARK.

Opinion of the Court.

the courts of the new State, the Supreme Court of the State
declares the methods to be followed by the courts of the State.
Even if, as a matter of technics, the replication was a departure
from the complaint, it is not easy to see how the defendant
could have availed himself of such a defect in a court of error.
His proper course, if he-wished to invoke the rigor of the law,
was to raise the question either by a demurrer or by a motion,
but-his conduct in agreeing to a change of venue, after the
pleadings had been perfected, in entering into a stipulation as
to the principal facts of the case, and in going to trial upon the
issue as made up, ought to preclude him from opening the
pleadings at the trial.
These views also dispose of the further objection that the
plaintiff did not, in his replication, plead a rescission of the
contract. But the reply did allege facts that gave a right to
rescind, and the plaintiff's evidence, if true, sustained those
allegations. Such a defect, if it were one, would, if demurred
to, have been curable by amendment, and cannot operate in a
court of error to invaliditte the trial below
Assuming the sufficiency of the pleadings, we are brought
to consider the second question in the case, and that is whether,
upon the evidence, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict and
judgment. The trial court having thought fit to peremptorily
direct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff in a stated
amount, the defendant is obviously entitled to the benefit of
every fact and presumption which might have justly controlled
the jury in his favor, or, in other terms, the plaintiff must be
able to sustain his judgment as the proper conclusion of the
law upon the uncontradicted or admitted facts of the case.
-There were three principal matters of contention in the trial
court.
1st. Did Ankeny have a good title to the northeast - quarter
of section 19, being part and parcel of -the lands which he
agreed to sell to Clark?
2d. Did Ankeny make an efficient tender of a good and
sufficient deed of conveyance
-3d. Supposing that Ankeny failed in one or both of these
particulars, was Clark disabled from availing himself of such

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

failure by having himself failed to pay the mortgage for $3000
upon the land contracted for, and which he had agreed to pay
as part of the purchase money, and did he waive tender of
a deed 2
We shall briefly consider these subjects in their order. And
first, as to Ankeny's title to the northeast quarter of section
19. It was conceded, in the stipulation filed, that the main
line of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was completed
in the year 1880, on the route and line shown by certain maps
of definite location attached to the stipulation, and that after
examination and report by commissioners, as provided in the
act of Congress, the road was accepted by the President of
the United States, that, on IMay 30, 1881, the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company executed and delivered to one
Peter Huff a warranty deed for said northeast quarter of section 19, and that, on December 13, 1881, the said Peter Huff,
together with his wife, executed and delivered to Ankeny a
warranty deed for the said northeast quarter of section 19.
Upon this state of facts it was contended by the plaintiff Clark
that there was nothing to show that the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company had paid into the Treasury of the United
States the cost of surveying, selecting and conveying the
same, as prescribed by the act of July 15, 1870, nor to show
that any patent had been granted to the railroad company,
and that hence, within the cases of Railway Company v
_Prescott, 16 Wall. 603, Railway Company v .cShane, 22
Wall. 444, and NTorthern Pacfic Railroadv. Traill County,
115 U S. 600, the Northern Pacific did not have and hold the
legal title to the tract in question, and, therefore, that the
conveyance by the railroad company to Huff and that by
Huff to Ankeny did not operate to vest a good legal title
in the latter.
On the part of the defendant Ankeny it was claimed that
by force of the original grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and the filing of its map of definite location,
and by reason of the construction and completion of its road,
and the acceptance thereof by the President of the United
States, there was vested in the railroad company a good legal

ANKENY v. CLARK.
Opinion of the Court.

title, and that it was not necessary to show affirmatively the
payment of the cost of the survey, nor to show that a patent
had been granted to the railroad company, and to sustain
this position he cited the case of Deseret Salt Co. v Tarpey,
142 U. S. 241.
Whether the reasoning and language of the cases so cited
by the respective parties can be satisfactorily reconciled, we
do not feel called upon to determine, because we think that, at
any rate, there is doctrine common to the cases that warranted
the plaintiff in refusing to accept the defendant's deed.
The opinions in the earlier cases, in treating of the effect
attributable to the non-payment by the railroad companies of
the cost of surveying, selecting and conveying the lands, as
prescribed by the act of July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 305, c. 292,
speak of the title remaining in the United States until such
payment shall be made. And the court below seized on this
language as establishing, in the present case, a want of legal
title in the :Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and consequently in its grantee, and hence held that the plaintiff was
justified in rejecting the defendant's title.
In the case of -Deseret Salt, Co. v. Tarpey, the court, per
Mr. Justice Field, regarded the failure or omission to pay the
survey charges as operative to " preserve to the government such
control over the property granted as to enable it to enforce
the payment of these costs, and for that purpose to withhold
its patents from the parties entitled to them until such payment," and thus to give the government a lien for said costs.
We therefore conclude that Ankeny, the defendant below, if
he held only a title derived from the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, and if that company had not paid the costs of surveying, and had not received a patent, did not hold such a
title as it was obligatory on the plaintiff to accept, and that
the plaintiff below had a right to refuse the tender of defendant's deed, declare the contract off, and maintain his action
for the recovery of the purchase money
But it is contended that the record does not disclose that
the costs of survey and conveyance had not been paid, and
that it may be presumed that they had' been paid, and even

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opimion of the Court.

that the lands had been actually patented to the railroad company, in wh.ich event the question whether the costs of survey
had been paid would be immaterial.
Turning to the pleadings and to the stipulation as to the
facts, we find that the defendant did not aver in his answer,
nor was it admitted in the stipulation that the railroad company had, complied with the necessary conditions as to
payment of costs of survey, nor was it alleged or admitted
that a patent had been issued to the railroad company for
the lands in question. The plaintiff having alleged want of
title in the defendant, and the latter having met that allegation only by the admission in the stipulation that the railroad
company had filed its map of definite location and nad constructe(d its road to the satisfaction of the President, we think
that the court below was warranted in holding that the defendant's title was imperfect, and that there was no question
of fact to submit to the jury
If we are right iif the conclusion that the defendant's title
to the land in dispute was imperfect, and subject to be defeated
by the United States in asserting their right to be paid the
costs of survey, it is not necessary to consider whether the
defendant made a proper tender of a deed of conveyance, or
whether the deed was in the form called for by the contract,
or whether the plaintiff waived a tender of the deed.
If the questions of tender and of waiver actually confronted us, it might be difficult to show that they ought not
to have been submitted to the jury But if the defendant had
no title which he could insist on the plaintiff's accepting, then
those questions have no legal significance.
An argument is made that, as the failure of title was only
as to part of the land, the plaintiff could not elect to rescind
as to all. But the contract was an entire one. The purchase
money was not apportioned among the several tracts. The
plaintiff's right to refuse to accept was, therefore, clear.
Duke of St. Albans v Shore, 1 H. Bl. 270.
Again, it is contended that the plaintiff was in no position
to rescind, because he had not himself fully complied with his
part of the contract, in that he had not paid the mortgage of

Opinion of the Court.

$3000 that was on the land, and the payment of which he
had assumed. If, however, the defendant had no sufficient
title to the land, that would relieve the plaintiff from the duty
of paying the incumbrance. It cannot be plausibly maintained
that, before a vendee can decline to accept an imperfect title
he must pay off a mortgage whose payment was to constitute
part of the purchase money
Another assignment of error is to the refusal of the court to
charge the plaintiff and credit the defendant with the rent of
the land during the period while the plaintiff was in possession. But the plaintiff was not in possession as a tenant, or
under any agreement that he should pay rent. Nor does the
law, under the circumstances of the case, rajse any obligation
to pay rent. Bardsley's .Appeal, 10 Atlantic Rep. 39, 40, is
directly in point "It may be conceded, if one occupy the
land of another by the consent of the latter, without any
agreement, that assumpsit for use and occupation will lie.
Such, however, is not this case. Here the possession was
taken and maintained under an express contract, by which
the appellant, in consideration of $8000 to be paid therefor,
agreed to convey to the vendee a certain house free and clear
of all incumbrances, and title to be perfect. At the date of
the agreement the vendee paid $500, and was at all times
ready to pay the residue of the purchase money on a deed
being delivered to him according to the agreement. The
vendor was. not able to execute a deed according to his contract. These facts show .the vendee was not in possession
under such circumstances as to create the relation of landlord
and tenant. There was neither an express nor an implied
contract to pay rent, and no action could be maintained to
recover for the use and occupation of the premises."
The authorities are uniform on this subject, and we content
ourselves with a reference to a few cases. Patterson v.
Stewart, 6 W & S. 527, Williams v. Rogers, 2 Dana (Ky.),
374, Gillet v .Maynard, 5 Johns. 86, Guthre v. Pugsley, 12
Johns. 126, Cook v. -Doggett,2 Allen, 439.
