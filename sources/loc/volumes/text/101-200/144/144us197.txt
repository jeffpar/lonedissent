RICE v. SANGER.
Opinion of the Court.

enormous. A declaration by this court that such notes and
bonds are void, because .of the absence of express legislative
authority to execute negotiable instruments for the money borrowed, will, we fear, produce incalculable mischief. Believing
the doctrine announced by the court to be unsound, upon
principle and authority, we do not feel at liberty to withhold
an expression of our dissent from the opinion.
