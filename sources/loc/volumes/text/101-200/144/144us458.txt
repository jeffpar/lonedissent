was affirmed. See, also, Central Railroadv. Pettus, 113 U. S.
116. It is unnecessary to more than refer to these decisions.
In the case before us, a trustee comes into a court of equity
and asks its aid in enabling him to discharge the duties of his
tiust; and, according to the settled law of this court, he is
entitled to an allowance for reasonable counsel fees. But we
think $1000 is too much. Indeed, in the bill of complainant,
the trustee alleges that $500 is a reasonable attorney's fee for
the foreclosure of the trust deed; and we think that under
the circumstances no more should be allowed.
The decree will, therefore, be modified by reducing the
amount found due Burnham, Tulleys & Company to $1094.16,
and the attorney's fee from $1000 to $500. In other respects
the. decree will be affirmed. The appellants will ;recover their
costs in this court.
Affirmed as modified.

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY
,V. ELLIS.
ERROR TO TnE SUREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
No. 1495.

Sub'mitted March 28, 1892.-

Decided Apri 11, 1892.

A decision by the highest court of a State that a former judgment of the
same court in the same case, between the. same parties, upon a demurrer, was res judicata in that action as to the rights of the parties,
presents no Federal question for the consideration of this court, and is
broad enough 'to maintain the judgment; and this court is therefore
without jurisdiction.

TME court stated the case as follows:

Ellis brought his action in the Circuit Court for Douglas
County, Wisconsin, against the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, E. L. Johnson, W., H. Sage and Henry W. Bradford, July 1, 1889, to quiet title .to seven lots in the city of
Superior, deraigned through one Roberts, to whom. the county

of Douglas, which held under certain tax deeds, had conveyed,
and then-averred that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
asserted title to the lots under a certain deed, a copy of which
was given. This deed recited that by resolution of the county
board of supervisors, passed on the 'ithday of September, 1880,
and duly entered in their record of proceedings, the coimty of
Douglas offered and agreed to transfer, by good and sufficient
deed or deeds, to the Northern Pacific lRailroad Company, all
the alienable lots or lands belonging to the, said county of
Douglas, which had been acquired by deed, and to which
said county had held undisputed title during two years then
last past, upon condition that the said Northern Pacific Railroad Company should, within the year 1881, construct, complete and equip a railroad from the Northern Pacific junction,
entering the State of Wisconsin, and running therein between
the St. Louis and the Nemadji Rivers to the Bay of Superior,
at or near the mouth of the Nemadji River, and thence to
Connor's Point, along or near the westerly side of said bay,
with a depot, and convenient connections with docks or piers;
that the railr6ad company by, resolution of its board of directors duly accepted the offer and terms of' the agreement, and
constructed, completed and equipped a railroad as required;
and, therefore, the county "hereby quit claims to the Northern Pacific Railroad, grantee, in consideration of the premises,
and for the sum of one dollar in hand paid by said grantee,"
etc., the lots in question and others, the deed being duly
executed by the county clerk and sealed with the county
seal, with proper witnesses and acknowledgment.
It was further alleged that prior to the issuing of the deed
the county board of Douglas County, on or about the 16th
day of December, 1880, entered into a contract with the railroad company, substantially as appeared by the recitals in the
deed, with the exception of an extension of time for one year
in which to complete the road; that the contract was without
authority upon the part of the counfy, and its acts were ultra
vi'es and void; that the railroad company neither paid to the
county or for its use; nor contracted to pay, any valuable consideration, nor to issue, nor did it issue, any stock in4he com-

pany to the county, or for its use, nor did the county ever
subscribe for or agree to take any stock in the coml niy; and
that the only consideration for the conveyance was the bonus
or inducement to the company to locate its road in Superior.
That the defendants Sage, Johnson and Bradford, respectively, claimed, as owners of the original title, some interest
*in some of these lots; and abstracts, showing the chain of
title, were affixed as exhibits.
That the value of all the lots was $1400; and that by
reason of the premises the plaintiff was embarrassed and
injured ii1 his title, etc.
The prAyer was for a decree that the plaintiff be adjudged
the.owner of the lots in fee simple, free from any lien, claim,
title or right made or exercised or attempted to be made or
exercised by the defendants, or any of them, by virtue of their
several claims of ownership; and that the deed from the county
of Douglas to the railroad company be adjudged illegal, null
and.void, and the plaintiff quieted in his title and possession, etc.
The railroad company filed its demurrer to the complaint
on July 23, 1889, assigning as grounds multifariousness and
insufficiency of facts stated to constitute a cause of action.
August 22, 1889, the Douglas County Circuit Court entered
an order overruling the demurrer, from which order the railroad company prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin.
The Supreme Court held that "a conveyance of its lands by
a county'as a donation to a railroad company is void; and the
legislature, having no power to adthorize such donation in the
first instance, cannot by a subsequent statute validate the conveyance;" 'and that the deed in question was, therefore, void;
and it gave judgment Maay 20, 1890, affirming the order of the
court below, and remanding the cause for further proceedings.

The opinion and order were filed. in the Douglas County
'Circuit Court July 23, 1890, and on August 15, 1890, the company fied its answer reasserting, among other things, its claim
under the deed of the county. â€¢

Statement of the Case.

March 11, 1891, the company applied for leave to fie a supplemental answer, whidh was denied, and on March 30 the
court made its findings upon which judgment was rendered
April 13, 1891, establishing the title of the plaintiff, and adjudging. the invalidity of the railroad company's claim.
A bill of exceptions was duly signed, and contained the
supplemental answer, which the railroad company had asked
leave to file, and the motion for such leave and the order
thereon denying it. This supplemental answer averred that
on December 13, 1889, the railroad company filed its bill of
o!nplaint in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Western District of Wisconsin against Roberts, Johnson and
Ellis, -(the plaintiff in this case,) setting forth the passage of
resolutions by the board of supervisors of Douglas County,'the
acceptance by the company of the proposition therein made,
and its compliance therewith by the construction of the line
of railroad required to be built, and the conveyance to the
company in accordance with another resolution of the board,
whereby, it was alleged, the company became owner in fee
simple of the real estate mentioned therein, of 'which all But
the seven lots embraced in this action was claindd ii the com-'
plaint; that' the identical question involved in this suit was
involved in the case in the Circuit Court of the United States,
which was heard, upon bill and answer, ENovember 18, 1890,
and taken under advisement, and on February 11, 1891, that
court directed a decree in favor of the company and against
the defendants, which decree was afterwards, on Marbh 7,
1891, duly entered, it being thereby ordered, adjudged and
decreed that the company was the full, legal and beneficial
owner of all the lands described in the bill of complaint in
said cause, and that the deeds of conveyance by the county to
Roberts and by R6berts to Ellis were and are invalid and 'of
no force and effect as against the complainant; and the railroad
company insisted upon this decree as an absolute bar to the
relief prayed in this action.
The bill of exceptions also showed the evidence offered on"
the trial in the state court, including the resolutions of the
supervisors of Douglas Cointy and 6f the railroad compajiy,

and the record of the suit in the United States court, which
was offered in evidence but excluded, exceptions being taken by
the railroad company. From the judgment of the Circuit
Court for Douglas County the railroad company appealed to
the. Supreme QCburt of the State, which, on November 17,
1891.. affirmed it.
The opinion of the Supreme Court by Winslow, J., will be
found reported in advance of the official series in 50 N. W.
Rep. 397. The court, after stating the case, said:
"The Circuit Court held, ii its rulings upon the proposed
answer and in its judgment, in effect, that the decision of this
court upoii the former appeal was res adjudicatain this action.
If this view was correct, then the judgment below must be
sustained, because upon that appeal the question was fairly
raised whether the county could lawfully donate the land in
question to the railroad company, and it was decided by this
court that it could not. It is vigorously contended by appellant's counsel that the rule of -law is that a decision can,only
become res adjudicatawhen it is contained in a final judgment
in the cause, and that the decision upon the demurrer being
confessedly not a final judgment, but granting leave to plead
over, it cannot be considered as res adjudicata,and authorities
are cited which undoubtedly tend .to support that contention.
We shall not attempt to review the authorities nor reconcile
conflicting decisions. It is sufficient to say that by repeated
decisions it has become the settled law in this State that the
de6ision of this court upon a demurrer is conclusive upon
the questions legitinately involved, and is res adjudicata in
that case. .Noonanv. Orton, 27 Wisconsin, 300; Lathrop v.
Enapp, 37 Wisconsin, 307; Fire Dept. v. Tuttle, 50 Wisconsin,
552. It is true that this court has decided that an order of the
Circuit Court upon a demurrer is not res adjudicata. This
doctrine, however, is based upon the ground that such an
order is reviewable by statute upon appeal from the judgment.
Hackett v; Carter, 38 Wisconsin, 394. But the decision of
this court upon a demurrer upon the questions properly involved cannot be reviewed by the Circuit Court, nor, indeed,
by this coitrt, save upon motion for rehearing. Such questions

are finally decided and settled for that case, and, as between
the parties to that litigation, for all time. This view of the
law decides this case. The complaint charged the appellant's
alleged title to be just what the proofs now before us show it
to be, and this court, prior td. the judgment in the United
States court, finally decided that such alleged title was worthless. The question was no longer an open one, and the Circuit
Court was right in ruling out the record of the action in the
United States court, and rendering judgment for the plaintiff."
.A writ of error was thereupon sued out from this court,
which the defendant in error moved to dismiss.

If this court has not jurisdiction of this case, and shall dismiss the writ of error herein, wo shall find ourselves confronted
with the anomalous position of having two judgments - one
of the Federal, the other of the state courts -between the
same parties and upon the same question, both final, but
antagoiiistic to each other, simply because the state courts
have disregarded, and, in so far as they could do so, nullified
a valid decree or judgment of a Federal court without any
other reason than it was within the discretion of the judge of
the Douglas Circuit Court- to deny the supplemental answer
-setting up the final decree of the Federal court. It seems to
us that this important question, which was passed upon by
the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, is reviewable here, inasmuch
as it brings up for consideration and decision the validity and
effect of decrees and judgments of the Federal courts under
the laws of. the United States. In other words, the railroad
claims a right adjudged it by a Circuit Court of the United
States-by a :Federal court; and if this is not a Federal question we must despair of ever falling upon one; it brings up a
right under the authority of the United States. Dpaseurv.

The equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts, fixed by the

Opinion of the Court.

Constitution and Statutes of the United States, is not safe in
its enforcement in the States, if the state courts may in their
discretion disregard the decrees of those United States courts,
and this court could not review the acti6n of the state courts.

The answer of the plaintiff in error admits its incorporation
under the laws of the United States, and alleges its authority
under the act of Congress of July 2, 1864-, to build a railroad
in the State of Wisconsin, and to acquire and hold real estate
therein, and to accept any grant, donation, etc., which might
be conferrel upon it. This is, therefore, an action against a
corporation of the United Srtoes, and an action arising under
$he laws of the United States of which this court has jurisdiction. Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U. S. 1.
The very right to hold this land under the grant to the railroad is brought in question and the Federal question is patent.
MR. CHiEF JusTIcE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The motion to dismiss the writ of error must be sustained.
The decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rested upon
an independent giround not involving a Federal question and
broad enough to maintain the judgment: Hfammond v. Johnston, 142 U. S. 73.
The Supreme Court held that by reason of its decision of
May 20, 1890, when the case was presented to the court on
the appeal of the railroad company from the order of the
lower court upon demurrer, the rights of the parties were res
adjudicata,and that it was itself, as the parties were, bound
by its own former judgment. Its conclusion had been announced and its mandate had gone down, and it had no power
upon a second appeal to review that judgment. This is the
settled rule in Wisconsin; Lathrop v. Enapp, 37 Wisconsin,
307; Oshkosh Fire Department v. Tuttle, 50 Wisconsin, 552;
and in. this court; Vlark v. Keith,. 106 U. S. 464; -haffin v.

man v. FoTt Scott, 141 U. S. 415. Under these circumstances
the judgment of the Supreme Couit is not subject to review
here.
The suit in the state court involving certain lots was commenced before the institution of the action in respect to other
real estate in the Circuit Court of the. United States, and the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the State had become res
adjudicatabetween the parties, before the decree was entered
by the Circuit Court. The judgment before us was rendered
in accordance with well-settled principles of general law, not
involving any Federal question, and did not deny to the decree
of the Circuit Court the effect which would be accorded under
similar circumstances to the judgments and decrees of the
state court.
The writ of error is

No. 1508.

SECOND CIRCUIT.
February 29, 1892.-Decided April 11, 1892.

A suit was brought in the Supreme Court of New York against a railroad
corporation created by an act of Congress, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff, who was a laborer on the road,
from the negligence of the defendant. The suit was removed by the
defendant into a Circuit Court of the United States, on the ground that
it arose under the act of Congress. It was tried before a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $4000. The defendant took a writ of error froin the Circuit Court of Appeals, which
affirmed the judgment. On a writ of error taken by the defendant from
this court to the Circuit Court of Appeals, a motion was made, by the
plaintiff, to dismiss or affirm: Held,
(1) Under Â§ 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, the
writ would lie, because the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was
not dependent entirely on the fact that the opposite parties to- the
suit were one of them an alien and the other a citizen of the
United States, or one of them a citizen of one State and-the other
