WARD v. SHERMAN.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY
ARIZONA.

OF

No. 25. Argued October 15, 16, 1903.-Decided January 11, 1904.
Where the holder of a defaulted mortgage on a cattle range and cattle
accepts the property in payment of the debt in pursuance of a written
contract and enters into possession, treating the property as his own
for all purposes, the former owner cannot, in the absence of fraud or
mistake, after three and a half years obtain a rescission of the contract
and treat the vendee as merely a mortgagee in possession. The doctrine
of laches applies.
The fact that the vendor failed to deliver part of the property and the
vendee commenced an action for the value thereof, alleging such value
as the unpaid balance of the original debt, does not amount to a repudiation on his part of the contract of sale, the affidavit accompanying the
complaint stating that the debt sued for was not secured by mortgage or
otherwise.
Where an action is not brought in proper form but the plaintiff's intention
is manifest equity will not destroy rights on account of a mere technical
mistake of counsel.

facts in this case are few and beyond dispute, most of
them being shown by the averments in the answer of the
defendant Sherman. On August 23, 1889, Ward, the plaintiff
and appellant, sold to the defendants the Sunflower range,
together with the cattle thereon and other personal property.
A conveyance was by agreement made to the defendant Hardenberg, who, to secure a part of the purchase price, to wit,
$25,000, evidenced by two notes of $12,500 each, made by
Hardenberg and guaranteed by Sherman, executed a mortgage
of the cattle and some other property. Thereafter the defendants incorporated themselves under the laws of the Terni-.
tory of Arizona as the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company,
and transferred to it all of the property above mentioned,

subject to the payment of the two notes held by the plaintiff.
On September 12, 1894, an agreement was entered into between the company and the plaintiff which, after reciting the
indebtedness, reads as follows:
"Whereas, the said party of the second part is unable to
pay to said party of the first part the said sum of $14,500 due
on October 1, 1894, and has notified said party of the first part
that it will be unable to pay said sum at said time; and
"Whereas, said party of the second part desires to deliver
up and turn over to said party of the first part all of the property heretofore purchased by one David Hardenberg of the
party of the first part, and for which said notes were given as
a part of the purchase money:
." Now, therefore, in consideration of the promises and agreements of said party of the first part, the said party of the
second part hereby agrees to and with said party of the first
part to transfer and convey by proper deeds of conveyance and
bills of sale all of the real and personal property heretofore
purchased by the said David Hardenberg of the said party of
the first part; also, all personal and real property owned by
the said party of the second part in the Territory of Arizona,
in whomsoever's name the same may now stand, to said party
of the first part, and more particularly described as follows,
to wit: The Sunflower Cattle Range in Maricopa County,
Arizona Territory; all cattle, horses, mules or burros branded
with either of the following brands: Diamond brand, thus: 0;
H. B. brand, thus: HB; also all wagons, mowing machines,
farming implements and camp outfit, and everything pertaining to or used by said Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company,
excepting only from the provision of said conveyance such
cattle as shall have been sold and delivered by said ShermanHardenberg Cattle Company prior or to September 1, 1894,
it being understood that all stock cattle which may have been
sold subsequent to September 1, 1894, shall be accounted for
by the party of the second part to said party of the first part.
"That in consideration of the said party of the second part

hereinbefore described within thirty days from the date hereof,
and delivering possession of the same to said party of the first
part or his authorized agent, in said county of Maricopa aforesaid, the said party of the first part hereby covenants and
agrees to deliver to said David Hardenberg and one M. H.
Sherman two promissory notes, each for $12,500, one of which
matures on October 1, 1894, and one of which matures on
October 1, 1897, heretofore executed by the said Hardenberg
and Sherman to the party of the first part; also to release the
said Hardenberg and Sherman from the payment of all interest
due thereon, and to cancel and discharge a certain chattel
mortgage executed by the said David Hardenberg to the said
party of the first part, for the purpose of securing the payment
of said notes, which said mortgage is now on file and of record
in the office of the county recorder of Maricopa County, in the
Territory of Arizona.
"In witness whereof, the said party of the second part, The
Sherman, Hardenberg Cattle Company, has executed these
presents in its corporate name, by its president, and the said
party of the first part has executed these presents the day and
year first above written."
The following instrument was also executed:

contract, and also to cancel the chattel mortgage held by you
on the property therein referred to.
"THE SHERMAN-HARDENBERG CATTLE CO.,
"By C. F. AINSWORTH, Its Secretary.
"I hereby authorize H. C. Ward as my agent to rec. the
above described property for me.
"J. M. WARD."
All the prbperty mentioned in this agreement was turned
over to Ward except, as he claimed, 104 head of cattle. Ward
retained possession of the property and managed it as his own,
but did not cancel the mortgage or surrender the notes, insisting that he was entitled to receive the 104 head of cattle or
else their value.
On June 12, 1895, he commenced an action in the District
Court for the county of Maricopa, in which he set forth a copy
of the first of the notes, and alleged that there was due thereon
the sum of $1500. At the same time he filed an affidavit for
an attachment, in which he averred that the payment of the
note was not secured by mortgage or lien upon any real or
personal property, or any pledge of personal property, and
that the amount due was $1500. No property was attached
and no service of process made until May 6, 1899, and then
only on the defendant Sherman, who thereupon filed an answer
and counterclaim, which was in the nature of a cross-bill in
equity, in which he set up the purchase from Ward, the organization of the company, the transfer to the company of
the property purchased and the agreement for the delivery
of the property to Ward and the return of the notes and cancellation of the mortgage, and alleged that though the property had been delivered the notes had not been returned nor
the mortgage cancelled. He also alleged a tfansfer by the
company to himself of all its rights and claims.
The trial court found the facts as above stated in respect
to the original transactions between Ward and defendants,

it to Sherman ; and, further, in reference to the transaction
between the company and Ward in 1894 it found as follows:
"5. That during the month of September, 1894, and before
the maturity of the first note, the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle
Company attempted to make a settlement with the plaintiff,
by agreeing to turn over to him the Sunflower range, all the
cattle then on the range, also the desert wells, and other property which it had, which was not included in the mortgage, on
condition that said plaintiff turn over and deliver up the two
notes aforesaid, with the interest thereon, and cancel and
satisfy the mortgage securing the same.
"6. That this contract was never carried out on the part of
the plaintiff; but that acting under it he took possession of all
the property of the Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company, as
aforesaid, on or about October 1, 1894; but never turned over,
delivered or cancelled said notes, or either of them; or satisfied
or discharged the chattel mortgage securing the same. And
that, on the contrary, he brought suit on one of said notes for
the collection of a portion that he claimed to be due thereon.
At the time he brought this suit on the note maturing October 1, 1894, the other note had not matured."
It thereupon adjudged that Ward was a mortgagee in possession, and after finding the disposition which he had made
of the property entered a judgment in favor of the defendant
Sherman for $17,173.50, and decreed the cancellation of the
notes and mortgage.
By section 1 of an act of the territorial assembly, Laws
Arizona, 1897, p. 127, it is provided that in a case appealed
to the Supreme Court of the Territory the appellant may have
the testimony taken in the trial transcribed and certified by
the court reporter, and filed with the papers in the case, and
that thereupon it shall "become and be a part of the record in
said cause;" and be transmitted to the Supreme Court of the
Territory with the other papers in the case. That was done
in this case, and part of the record taken to the Supreme Court

of the Territory and brought here is the duly certified transscript of the testimony taken on the trial.
Section 2 of that act also provides that it shall not be necessary "to file with the Supreme Court any transcript, assignment of errors or other papers except as herein provided."
Section 3 requires the plaintiff in error, or appellant, to make
an abstract of the record for the benefit of the opposite party
and the Supreme Court. Sections 4 and 5 are as follows:
"SEc. 4. Each party shall prepare and print or typewrite
an argument of the points and authorities relied on. The
briefs of both sides shall begin with a succinct statement of so
much of the record as is essential to the questions discussed
in them, referring to the printed abstract by folios and sufficient to dispense with the reading of the printed abstract on
the argument. The brief of the plaintiff in error or appellant
shall also next contain a distinct enumeration in the form of
propositions of the several errors relied on, and all errors not
assigned in the printed brief shall be deemed to have been
waived. It shall not be necessary to assign or file any assignment of errors in the court below or Supreme Court, except
those assigned in the brief of the plaintiff in error or appellant.
"SEc. 5. All rulings made by the court below in opposition
to the plaintiff in error or appellant shall be taken as excepted
to by the party appealing or suing out the writ of error, and
when assigned as error in the brief shall be reviewed by the
Supreme Court without any bill of exceptions or other assignment of errors as herein provided."
The record discloses that in the Supreme Court the appellee
moved to strike from the files appellant's abstract of record.
No action appears to have been taken upon this motion. The
record also discloses that leave was given to the appellant to
file a supplemental brief. Neither the original nor the supplemental brief, if one was fied, is before us.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

Mr. C. F. Ainsworth for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The Supreme Court of the Territory, without considering
the merits of the case, affirmed the judgment on the ground
that the assignment of errors was insufficient, citing in its
opinion from a rule of practice which had been prescribed by
it and in force for many years: "All assignments of errors must
distinctly specify each ground of error relied upon, and the
particular ruling complained of. .
.
An objection to the
ruling or action of the court below will be deemed waived here,
unless it has been assigned as error, in the manner above provided." Undoubtedly the assignment of errors was general
in its terms. An application was made to the Supreme Court
for leave to amend the assignment of errors, but it was denied.
In a short per curiam opinion that court, after condemning the
assignments as insufficient, said:
"The rules relating to assignments and specifications of error
have been so long in force, and we have so often decided that a
failure to make proper assignments amounts to a waiver of all
errors which are not fundamental, that it would seem there
should be no longer occasion for disregard of these plain requirements. In the absence of any assignment of error in this
case, and none appearing upon the face of the record, the
judgment must be affirmed."
We shall not stop to inquire whether the court erred in
refusing to permit an amendment of the assignment of errors,
but accepting its conclusion that the failure to make proper
assignments is "a waiver of all errors which are not fundamental," and bearing in mind the provisions of section 5 of the
statute of 1897, that all rulings made by the court below in
opposition to the plaintiff or appellant are to be taken as
excepted to, we proceed to inquire whether there was not a
fundamental error which should have been corrected by the

WARD v. SHERMAN.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court. We are of opinion that there was. It may
be assumed, as no objection was made on that account, that
the counterclaim, which was in its nature a bill in equity for
the redemption of the mortgaged property, was properly filed
in this action to recover money. Can such a bill be sustained
under the circumstances disclosed by the answer? It appears
from that answer that the property was turned over to Ward
to hold, not as mortgagee, but under a contract by which he
was to take the property in satisfaction of the debt, cancel the
mortgage and return the notes. In other words, according to
the averments of the answer a contract of sale was made by
the company to Ward, and under the contract of sale Ward
took possession. Now, even if it be conceded that Ward's
failure to perform was such a breach of the contract as entitled
the company to rescind and thereafter to treat Ward as a
mortgagee in possession, a bill in equity to enforce such a decision must be presented within a reasonable time. The right
to rescind is an affirmative right, asserted by the vendor, the
former mortgagor, and, being such, it must be asserted by him
within a reasonable time. The answer alleges that on or about
October 1, 1895, this agreement was made and the property
delivered, but it was not filed until May 16, 1899, more than
three years and a half thereafter. During all that time, Ward
was in possession of the property, managing and dealing with
it as his own. Can it be that a vendor can wait three years
and a half, permit the vendee to deal with the property as his
own-that property being of a value variable from year to year
and requiring constant care to make it prosperous-give his
time and labor to its management, take the chances of rise or
fall in the market, and then, if it turns out that the business
has been prosperous through his efforts, insist on account of
some technical failure upon a rescission of the contract, and
that the party who has been supposing himself the owner, and
acting as such, shall be treated as a mortgagee in possession,
and held to account for the success of his business efforts?
In Pollock's Principles of Contracts, p. 515, the author says:

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

"The contract must be rescinded within a reasonable time,
that is, before the lapse of a time after the true state of things
is known, so long that under the circumstances of the particular
case the other party may fairly infer that the right of rescission
is waived."
See also Grymes v. Sanders, 93 U. S. 55; McLean v. Clapp,
141 U. S. 429, 432.
But was there any ground for the rescission of the contract?
There was no fraud, mistake or false representations. There
is no suggestion that the contract was not entered into with
full knowledge or that it was unfair in any of its details. The
complaint merely is that Ward was guilty of a breach of one
of its stipulations. If so, the company was entitled to damages for that breach, but no damages are shown. The company paid nothing; has lost nothing. So far as disclosed it
went out of business, and therefore the failure to release the
mortgage could not have injured its business credit. But
whatever may be the rights, other than a simple claim of
damages for breach of contract, possessed by the company
and transferred by it to the defendant Sherman, they are
equitable in their nature, and in respect to them the general
doctrine of laches applies. We have often had occasion to
consider the question of laches. In Galliher v. Cadwell, 145
U. S.368, 373, and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company v.
Austin, 168 U. S.685, are collected the decisions of the court.
In the former of these cases it is said, p. 372.
"They (the adjudicated cases) proceed on the assumption
that the party to whom laches is imputed has knowledge of his
rights, and an ample opportunity to establish them in the
proper forum; that by reason of his delay the adverse party
has good reason to believe that the alleged rights are worthless, or have been abandoned; and that, because of the change
in condition or relations during this period of delay, it would
be an injustice to the latter to permit him to now assert them."
And again, p. 373:
"But it is unnecessary to multiply cases. They all proceed

WARD v. SHERMAN.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

upon the theory that laches is not, like limitation, a mere
matter of time; but principally a question of the inequity of
permitting the claim to be enforced-an inequity founded upon
some change in the condition or relations of the property or
the parties."
And in the last case, p. 698:
"The reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the
lapse of time during which the neglect to enforce the right has
existed, but the changes of condition which may have arisen
during the period in which there has been neglect.. In other
words, where a court of equity finds that the position of the
parties has so changed that equitable relief cannot be afforded
without doing injustice, or that the intervening rights of third
persons may be destroyed or seriously impaired, it will not
exert its equitable powers in order to save one from the consequences of his own neglect."
Apply these considerations to the case at bar. The property
was turned over on a contradt of sale. Ward was left in possession for over three years and a half without a suggestion of
any claim that he was only a mortgagee in possession. He
had a right to believe that he was the owner. If the contract
had not been made he could have foreclosed his mortgage and
acquired title by sale under foreclosure proceedings. He dealt
with the property as his own. He gave his time, skill and labor
to the work of caring for it. It is impossible to replace the
parties in the situation they were in at the time the contract
was made. It would be grossly inequitable to deprive him of
the benefit of his time, skill and labor, and give it to the mortgagor, who all those years did nothing and gave no notice of
any question of the completeness of Ward's title. It seems to
us that the doctrine of laches applies with force, and that upon
the pleadings the court should have adjudged .the defendant
not entitled either to a rescission of the contract or to hold the
vendee as a mortgagee in possession.
If we look beyond the pleadings to the testimony (and that,
as we have seen, was by virtue of the statute made a part of the
VOL. cxcii-12

192 U. S.

record of the case in the Supreme Court) the error of the trial
court is even more apparent.
The agreement of September 12 provided for the transfer
and conveyance of all cattle on the Sunflower range, branded
with the named brands, "excepting only from the provision
of said conveyance such cattle as shall have been sold and
delivered by said Sherman-Hardenberg Cattle Company prior
or to September 1, 1894, it being understood that all stock
cattle which may have been sold subsequent to September 1,
1894, shall be accounted for by the party of the second part to
said party of the first part." By this all the cattle belonging
to the company on September 1 were to be transferred to the
plaintiff, and if any of such cattle had been sold subsequently
to September 1 they were to be accounted for by the company
to the plaintiff. Further, the agreement stipulated for the
delivery and cancellation of the notes and mortgage "in consideration of the said party of the second part conveying to
said party of the first part all of the property hereinbefore
described within thirty days from the date hereof, and delivering possession of the same to said party of the first part or
his authorized agent, in said county of Maricopa aforesaid."
By the undisputed testimony two lots of cattle, one of 69 or
70 head and the other of 34 or 35 head, were sold and delivered
by the company to other parties than the plaintiff after the
first of September. Therefore the company was to account for
those cattle so sold and delivered, and the duty resting upon
Ward to surrender and cancel the notes and mortgage was
conditioned upon the delivery within the county of the property
described within thirty days from September 12. In short,
the terms of the contract were clear. Ward performed all that
he was under obligations to perform. The default was on the
part of the company. Ward took possession of the property
delivered, managed it successfully for several years, and still
the court held that the defaulting party could take advantage
of its own default, appropriate the entire profits of Ward's care
and ability, and upon that basis adjudged against Ward the

Syllabus.

return of all the property then in his possession and the payment of over seventeen thousand dollars. But it is said that
Ward himself repudiated the agreement because he brought
suit on the first of the notes. There may have been a technical
mistake in the form of the action, but there was no repudiation
of the agreement, as is shown by the fact that the complaint
only asked judgment for $1500, and that Ward filed with the
complaint an affidavit for an attachment, in which he averred
that the payment of the sum due was "not secured by any
mortgage or lien upon real or personal property or any pledge
of personal property." But equity will not destroy rights on
account of a mere technical mistake of counsel. It may be
conceded that Ward should have brought an action in form for
the value of the cattle not delivered, but it is manifest that that
value was all that he was seeking to recover.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed and
the case remanded to that court with instructions to reverse
the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to
that court for further proceedings in conformity to the views
herein expressed.
