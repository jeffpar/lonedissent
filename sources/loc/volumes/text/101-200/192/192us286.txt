no substantial identity in the character of the two devices,
unless, by substantial identity, is meant every combination
which produces the same effect. The differences between the
Diehl device and the Cramer construction are substantial and
not merely colorable.
The trial court should have granted the motion to direct a
verdict for the defendant. In affirming the action of the trial
court in overruling the motion, the Circuit Court of Appeals
erred, and its judgment must, therefore, be reversed. The
judgment of the Circuit Court is also reversed and the cause
is remanded to that court with directions to grant a new trial,
and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
No. . Original. Argued April 13, 14, 15, 1903; reargued January 8, 11, 12, 1904.-Decided
February 1, 1904.

This court has jurisdiction over an action brought by one State against
another to enforce a property right, and where one State owns absolutely
bonds of another State, which are specifically secured by shares of stock
belonging to the debtor State this court can enter a decree adjudging
the amount due and for foreclosure and sale of the security in case of
non-payment, leaving the question of judgment over for any deficiency
to be determined when it arises.
The motive of a gift does not affect its validity, nor is the jurisdiction of
this court affected by the fact that the bonds were originally owned by an
individual who donated them to the complainant State.
Where a statute provides that a State issue bonds at not less than par to
pay for a subscription to stock of a railroad company; and, after advertising for bids in accordance with the statute and receiving none, the bonds
are delivered to the railroad company in payment of the subscription, the

transaction is equivalent to a cash sale to the company at par, and the
State becomes the owner of the stock even though no formal certificates
therefor are issued to it.
Under the special provisions of the statute involved the endorsement on
bonds that each bond for $1000 is secured by an equal amount of the
par value of the stock subscribed for by the State, is tantamount to a
separation and identification of the number of shares mentioned and constitutes a separate and registered mortgage on that number of shares for
each bond.
A holder of a certain number of such bonds may foreclose on the specific
number of shares securing his bonds and the holders of other bonds and of
liens on the property of the railroad company are not necessary parties to
the foreclosure suit.

By an act passed in 1849, chap. 82, Laws, 1848-49, the
North Carolina Railroad Company was chartered by the State
of North Carolina with a capital of $3,000,000, divided into
30,000 shares of $100 each. The State subscribed for 20,000
shares. The statute authorized the borrowing of money to
pay the state subscription and pledged as security therefor the
stock of the railroad company held by the State. In 1855 a
further subscription for 10,000 shares was authorized by statute, chap. 32, Laws, 1854-55, to be issued on the same terms
and with the same security. At the same session an act was
passed incorporating the Western North Carolina Railroad
Company, chap. 228, Laws, 1854-55, which authorized a subscription by the State and the issue of bonds secured by
the stock held by the State in said company. On December 19, 1866, a further act was passed, chap. 106, Laws, 186667, entitled "An act to enhance the value of the bonds to be
issued for the completion of the Western North Carolina Railroad, and for other purposes," which, after referring to the
prior acts of the State authorizing the issue of bonds and stating that a portion of them had already been issued, added:
"And, whereas, it is manifestly the interest of the people of
the whole State, that the residue of the bonds, when issued,
shall command a high price in market; therefore,
"SEC. 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
North Carolina,and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the

same, That the public treasurer be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed, whenever it shall become his duty under the
provisions of said acts, passed at the sessions of 1854-55 and
1860-61, to issue bonds of the State to the amount of fifty
thousand dollars or more, to mortgage an equal amount of the
stock which the State now holds in the North Carolina Railroad, as collateral security for the payment of said bonds, and
to execute and deliver, with each several bond, a deed of mortgage for an equal amount of stock to said North Carolina
Railroad, said mortgage to be signed by the Treasurer and
countersigned by the Comptroller, to constitute a part of said
bond, and to be transferable in like manner with it, as provided in the charter of said Western North Carolina Railroad
Company; and, further, that such mortgages shall have all the
force and effect, in law and equity, of registered mortgages
without actual registry."
Under this last act bonds were issued in the sum of $1000
each, having this indorsement:
"State of North Carolina, Treasury Department,

North Carolina entitled 'An act to enhance the value of the

19th December, 1866, ten shares of the stock in the North
Carolina Railroad Company, originally subscribed for by the
State, are hereby mortgaged as collateral security for the payment of this bond.

tioned bonds have been compromised with the exception of
about $250,000. Simon Schafer and Samuel M. Schafer, either
individually or as partners, owned a large proportion of these
outstanding bonds,, having held them for about thirty years.
In 1901 Simon Shafer gave ten of these bonds to the State of
South Dakota. The letter accompanying the gift was in these
words:
"Office of Schafer Brothers, No. 35 Wall Street,
"NEw YORK, September 10th, 1901.
"Hon. Charles H. Burke.
"Dear Sir: The undersigned, one of the members of the firm
of Schafer Bros., has decided, after consultation with the other
holders of the second-mortgage bonds issued by the State of
North Carolina, to donate ten of these bonds to the State of
South Dakota.
"The holders of these bonds have waited for some thirty
years in the hope that the State of North Carolina would
realize the justice of their claims for the payment of these
bonds.
"The bonds are all now about due, besides, of course, the
coupons, which amount to some one hundred and seventy
per cent of the face of the bond.
"The holders of these bonds have been advised that they
cannot maintain a suit against the State of North Carolina on
these bonds, but that such a suit can be maintained by a foreign State or by one of the United States.
"The owners of these bonds are mostly, if not entirely, persons who liberally give charity to the needy, the deserving and
the unfortunate.
"These bonds can be used to great advantage by States or
foreign governments; and the majority owners would prefer
to use them in this way rather than take the trifle which is
offered by the debtor.
"If your State should succeed in collecting these bonds it
would be the inclination of the owners of a majoriti of the total
issue now outstanding to make additional donations to such

governments as may be able to collect from the repudiating
State, rather than accept the small pittance offered in settlement.
"The donors of these ten bonds would be pleased if the
legislature of South Dakota should apply the proceeds of these
bonds to the State University or to some of its asylums or
other charities.
"Very respectfully,
" SIMON SCHAFER."
Prior thereto, and on March 11, 1901, the State of South
Dakota had passed the following act, Session Laws, South
Dakota, chap. 134, p. 227:
"An act to require the acceptance and collections of grants,
devises, bequests, donations, and assignments to the State
of South Dakota.
"Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota:
"SEc. 1. That whenever any grant, devise, bequest, donation
or gift or assignment of money, bonds or choses in action, or of
any property, real or personal, shall be made to this State, the
governor is hereby directed to receive and accept the same,
so that the right and title to the same shall pass to this State;
and all such bonds, notes or choses in action, or the proceeds
thereof when collected, and all other property or thing of value,
so received by the State as aforesaid shall be reported by the
governor to the legislature, to the end that the same may be
covered into the public treasury or appropriated to the State
University or to the public schools, or to state charities, as may
hereafter be directed by law.
"SEc. 2. Whenever it shall be necessary to protect or assert
the right or title of the State to any property so received or
derived as aforesaid, or to collect or reduce into possession any
bond, note, bill or chose inaction, the attorney general is directed
to take the necessary and proper proceedings and to bring suit
in the name of the State in any court of competent jurisdiction,
state or Federal, and to prosecute all such suits, and is author-

ized to employ counsel to be associated with him in such suits
or actions, who, with him, shall fully represent the State, and
shall be entitled to reasonable compensation out of the recoveries and collections in such suits and actions."
This act was passed on the suggestion that perhaps a donation of bonds of Southern States would be made to the State.
On November 18, 1901, the State of South Dakota, leave having been first obtained, filed in this court its bill of complaint,
making defendants the State of North Carolina, Simon Rothschilds (alleged to be one of the holders and owners of the bonds
originally issued-by the State and secured by a pledge of the
stock in the North Carolina Railroad Company under the acts
of 1849 and 1855) and Charles Salter (alleged to be one of the
holders of the bonds issued under the act of 1855 and 1866 on
account of the subscription to the Western North Carolina
Railroad Company), the two individuals being made defendants as representatives of the classes of bondholders to which
they severally belong. In it the plaintiff, after setting forth
the facts in reference to the several issues of bonds and its
acquisition of title to ten, prayed that an account might be
taken of all the bonds issued by virtue of these statutes; that
North Carolina be required to pay the amount found due on
the bonds held by the plaintiff, and that in default of payment
North Carolina and all persons claiming under said State might
be barred and foreclosed of all equity and right of redemption
in and to the thirty thousand shares of stock held by the State,
and that these shares or as many thereof as might be necessary
to pay off and discharge the entire mortgage indebtedness, be
sold and the proceeds after payment of costs be "applied in
satisfaction of the bonds and coupons secured by such mortgages; and also for a receiver and an.injunction.
Defendant Rothschilds made no answer. On April 2, 1902,
the State of North Carolina and the defendant, Charles Salter;
filed separate answers. North Carolina in its answer denied
both the jurisdiction of this court and the title of the plaintiff;
averred that the bonds were not issued in conformity with the

192 U. S.

statute; admitted the ownership of thirty thousand shares of
stock; denied that the mortgages were properly executed or
that they had the effect of conveyances or transfers either in
law or equity of said stock, or conferred any lien by way of
pledge or otherwise upon the same; denied that she ever had
any compact or agreement whatever other than that contained
in the Constitution of the United States with South Dakota,
or that South Dakota had ever informed North Carolina of any
claim against her, or made any demand in respect to it, or any
effort to settle or accommodate. Salter's answer was mainly
an admission of the allegations of the bill with a claim that all
the stock should be sold in satisfaction of the mortgage bonds
of which he was charged to be the representative. Testimony
was taken under direction of the court before commissioners
agreed upon by the parties.
Mr. Wheeler H. Peckham, with whom Mr. R. W. Stewart was
on the brief, for complainant:
This court has jurisdiction as the suit comes within the precise terms of Art. III of the Constitution. Where the language
used in a constitution or statute is plain, clear and free from
ambiguity there is no room or occasion for interpretation, and
the language must be construed according to its plain meaning
and intent. One citation is sufficient-Bate Refrigerating Co.
v. Sulzberger, 157 U. S.1. "Quoties in verbis nulla est ambiguitas ibi nudia expositio contra rerbafienda est." Everard v.
Poppleton, 5 Q. B. 183; Gad.sby v. Barry, 8 Scott, N. R. 804.
The decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, that the suit
would lie was the occasion for the Eleventh Amendment to the
Constitution, but as it limited to the event of a citizen suing a
State it became conclusive proof that, as to suits between two
or more States, or suits by a State against citizens of another
State, it was intended that the provisions of the original Constitution should stand. See Curtis on U. S. Const. 2d ed.
15.
A State is also liable to be sued by the United States in this

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.

Argument for Complainant.

Court. United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621; on an action of
debt. United States v. North Carolina,136 U. S. 211.
The United States also may be sued by a State in this court
pursuant to a statute. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373,
and see Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 406.
The ground of the jurisdiction is that the States have by
adopting the constitution agreed to submit controversies between themselves to the determination of this court. Rhode
Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 720. No exception was made
of any possible case which might arise. The settlement of
claims by diplomacy or by war was taken away by the Constitution, and it was necessary to make some provision to take
their place. Such provision was made by the organization of
this court and giving it this jurisdiction. It is most just that
the jurisdiction should be exercised where the plaintiff's claim
is for the collection of debt; for, when a State enters into thd
markets of the world as a borrower, she for a time lays aside
her sovereignty and becomes responsible as a civil corporation.
Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 740; Murray v. Charleston, 96
U. S. 445. The cases of New Hampshire and New York against
Louisiana can be distinguished from this case.
The State of Dakota is competent to become the owner and
holder of these bonds. Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700. It is
incident to the sovereign power both to draw and purchase
bills. United States v. Bank, 12 Pet. 377. Also to become a
donee, whether by legacy or otherwise. Matter of Meriam,
141 N. Y. 479, 484; Estate of Cullom, 5 Misc. N. Y. 173, aff'd
145 N. Y. 593; United States v. Fox, 94 U. S. 315.
Subd. 1, section 10, article II, of the Constitution, which forbids a State to enter into any agreement or compact with
another State, does not affect the right of the complainant to
hold these bonds; the compacts or agreements intended are
of a political nature, such as could be made between sovereigns
only and not ordinary business agreements. Union Branch R.

Com. §§ 1354 and 1401, et seq. A promise to pay money is not

an agreement of the character intended to be prohibited. See
4 Dall. 456; 96 U. S. 445; Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 572,
citing Vattel.
There is nothing in the answer or proofs respecting the gift
in controversy in this suit which affects the jurisdiction. The
gift was absolute and the State had a right to accept it. See
B. R. Curtis in N. Am. Review, January, 1844, and vol. 2,
p. 93 of Curtis's Life.
It is impossible to impute to the complainant any improper
motive, any more than if the gift had been by a legacy rather
than by gift inter vivos. But motive, even in a complainant,
is immaterial. The only question is, has the complainant a
right? Whether acquired with good, bad or indifferent motives is quite immaterial. Morris v. Tuthill, 72 N. Y. 575;
Rice v. Rockefeller, 134 N. Y. 174; Ramsey v. Gould, 57 Barb.
398; 2 Morawetz on Corporations, § 259, and cases cited; Pender v. Lushington, L. R. 6 Ch. Div. 75; Phelps v. Nowlen, 72
N. Y. 39; McDonald v. Smith, 1 Pet. 620, 624; Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280; Smith v. Kernochan, 7 How. 198; Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co., 176 U. S. 181; Toler v. R. R. Co.,
67 Fed. Rep. 177.
When the State owns the whole interest, legal and beneficial,
in the bonds sued on, which interest it was empowered to acquire and did acciuire by virtue of the act of the legislature, by
a donation from individuals, it makes no difference that the
motive of the donor was the hope that the State would bring
suit on the bonds.
The assignment of the bonds of the defendant State to the
complainant State carried with it the mortgage of the railroad
stock created by the legislature of the defendant State to
secure the bonds. Converse v. Michigan Dairy Co., 45 Fed.
Rep. 18.
The endorsement and delivery operated as an assignment of
the mortgage and transferred to the holder of the notes the
same equitable rights in the mortgage which he had in the
notes. Cooper v. Ulmann, Walk. Ch. 251; Briggs v. Hanno-

wald, 35 Mich. 474; Carpenterv. Longan, 16 Wall. 271; Kennicott v. Supervisors, 16 Wall. 452; Ober v. Gallagher,93 U. S. 199.
In these cases though only a portion of the notes or bonds were
acquired by the complainant the transfer enabled the complainant to foreclose, because an assignment of a part of the
debt, or of one or several bonds or notes, secured by the mortgage carries with it a proportionalinterest in the mortgage.
The defendant State made a statutory *mortgage to secure
the whole issue of the bonds sued on. The act provided for
mortgaging an equal amount of stock as collateral security
for the payment of said bonds. Plainly, the whole amount of
shares of stock became security for the whole amount of the
bonds. 3 White and Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity, 3d Am.
ed., Wallace's notes to the cases of Row v. Dawson and Ryall
v. Rowles, pp. 369 and 646.
The mortgage is simply security for the debt, and whatever transfers the debt carries with it the mortgage. English
v. Carney, 25 Michigan, 178.
A mortgage given to secure several obligations stands as
security for the whole, and if a mortgagee assigns one of the
obligations to a third person, the mortgage in equity stands
as security for all the obligations, as well for the one assigned
as those retained. Kortlanderv. Elston, 52 Fed. Rep. 180, 183;
Mdtter of Bronson, 150 N. Y. 20; Jermainv. L. S. Ry. Co., 91
N. Y. 483, 492. As to undivided fractional interests in the
whole, see Flynn v. Brooklyn City R. R. Co., 158 N. Y. 504;
Matter of Fitch, 160 N. Y. 94; 1 Morawetz on C6rp. §§ 234, 237.
As to rights of the second mortgage bondholders, see Sager v.
Tupper, 35 Michigan, 134; Wheeler v. Menold, 81 Iowa, 647.
In any aspect of this case, the first and second mortgage
bondholders, upon the general principles of equity, being interested in the funds, must be made parties. Story Eq. P1.

As to making the holders of first mortgage bonds parties, see
Heffner v. Life Ins. Co., 123 U. S. 747, 754, and cases cited;

Murdock v. Woodson, 2 Dillon, 188; Board v. Min. Pt. R. R.,
24 Wisconsin, 93; Campbell v. Texas R. R., 2 Woods, 263.
The certificate upon the bond, with regard to security for
ten shares, being no part of the statute, cannot affect the construction of the statute, as to which the rule is that what is
implied in it is as much a part of it as what is expressed.
The intention of the maker of the statute being as much
within the statute as it is within the letter, the court has to
ascertain the meaning; which was to mortgage all the stock to
secure all the bonds, each proportionately. United States v.
Babbitt, 1 Black, 61; County of Watson v. Nat. Bank, 103 U. S.
770.
As to former litigation in regard to legislation of North
Carolina concerning this road, see Swasey v. Nrorth Carolina,

34 Fed. Rep. 829.
In such cases, equities adjudged against parties served with
process are binding upon all persons of the same class, although
absent from the litigation, because of the vicarious representation in the present litigants of the same class to which they
belong. Morton v. New OrleansP. R., 75 Alabama, 590, 611.

The construction of the clauses of the Constitution giving
jurisdiction to this court over controversies between States and
between States and citizens of other States should be liberal
in the extreme to favor such jurisdiction and to carry out the
beneficent purposes by the Constitution sought to be obtained.

and Mr. James H. Nerrimonfor the defendant, State of North
Carolina :
The court is without jurisdiction to make any decree against
the State of North Carolina in this cause. A sovereign cannot be sued. Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10; The Siren, 7
Wall.152 ; Smith v. Weguelin, L. R. 1869, 8 Eq. 198; Briggsv.

Hans v. Louisiana,134: U. S. 1 ; Louisianav. Texas, 176 U.S. 1.
The State did not consent to the exercise of jurisdiction by
pleading to the merits. Rhode Islandv. Massachusetts, 12 Pet.

444; Justice Iredell's opinion in the Chisholm Case, 2 Dall. 429.
Apparently, there was bill, answer and proof in New Hampshire v. Louisiana,108 U. S. 76, and yet the court dismissed
the cause for want of jurisdiction.
This court has jurisdiction of the parties, provided it be such
a "controversy between two or more States" as is contemplated in the grant of judicial power by Art. III, sec. 2, of
the Constitution, and if it be, not such a controversy the objection may be taken at any time. Equity Rule, 29; 1 Foster's
Fed. Prac. 241, 249, 535, 536 ; Indiana v. Tolliston Club, 53
Fed. Rep. 18. The only authority competent to give consent
for the State to be sued is the general assembly of the State.
Afoody v. State Prison, 128 N. Car. 12. This has not been
done. If a State consents to be sued the consent can be withdrawn at any time, as it has been by the protest of the State.
Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527 ; lighell v. Sultan of Johore,
1894, 1 Q. B. 149 ; Judgment of Lord Esher.
The State did not consent to be sued in a cause like this by
becoming a member of the United States and subscribing to
the Constitution. The present suit is not such a "controversy
between two or more States" as was contemplated by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Argument for Defendant, State of North Carolina

192 U. S.

Constitution of the United States. There are many cases in
which this court has decided against the jurisdiction which
seemed to come within the words of the Constitution. -entucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66; .lississippi v. Johnson, 4
7
Wall. 475 ; Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50 ; _V
ew Hampshire
v. Louisiana,108 U. S. 76; Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance
(Jo., 127 U. S. 265, 287; Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1;
.ouisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1.
The grant was of "judicial power," hence, controversies
not properly subject, according to the accepted principles of
jurisprudence, to judicial determination, were not included.
.Louisianav. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 18. The word "controversies"
is not defined in the Constitution, but all controversies were
not intended, because the word "all," which had been used
in the preceding grants, was dropped here and purposely.
2 Bancroft's History of the Constitution, 199, 200, 212; Rhode
Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 721.
The controversies intended by the framers of the Constitution were naturally akin to those with which they had become
familiar from the experience of the colonies, such as those
growing out of claims for soil, territory, jurisdiction and boundary. United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 639 ; Story on the
Constitution, §§ 1674, 1675.
The dispute must arise directly between the States and not
be an assumed quarrel. As to the nature of the controversy,
see The Federalist, INo. 80. Until recently this court has entertained jurisdiction only in boundary disputes. In each of the
only two cases recently brought, 3fissouri v. Illinois,180 U. S.
208; Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, the controversy
arose directly between the contending States, and was not factitious-made by the voluntary action of the complaining
State by assuming a controversy already existing and with
which it had no proper concern. Practices such as were complained of in 3lissouri v. Illinois, and Kansas v. Colorado, as
well as the cases of disputed boundary, might lead to war between independent nations; but surely there was no absolute
necessity in order to prevent an "appeal to the sword" for a
tribunal to collect ordinary debts; loans due by a State to

Argument for Defendant, State of North Carolina.

private individuals, and which they, being unable to collect,
voluntarily assign to another State.
While writers on international law differ somewhat among
themselves, many of those of greatest authority say that it is
the practice of nations, when petitioned by their citizens, to intervene for the enforcement of obligations due by other nations
to them, to make a distinction between such obligations as are
contractural-loans voluntarily entered into with a knowledge
of all the risks and the inability of collection by suit-and such
as are tortios. They generally refuse to interfere for the
collection of debts, but do, for the redress of other kinds of
grievances. 1 Halleck International Law, 435, and note;
Hall's International Law, 3d ed. 277; New Hampshire v.
Louisiana, 108 U. S. 76.
And such has been the practice of England and the United
States. Wharton's Digest Int. Law, § 231; 5 Am. State

But it is understood that the contention of complainant's
counsel is that this suit is brought in vindication of its property
rights, and there are several cases in which this court has entertained original bills to protect the proprietary rights of a State
against injury or infringement by individuals,such as Georgia
v. Brailsford,2 Dall. 402; Pennsylvaniav. Wheeling Bridge
Conpany, 13 How. 618; Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700; Florida
v. Anderson, 91 U. S. 667 ; Alabama v. Burr, 115 U. S. 413.
The fact that the suit is brought in vindication of the property rights of the complaining State is also not conclusive. In
_ew Hamyshire v. Louisiana, 108 U. S. 76, and Wisconsin v.
Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265, property rights were involved; but the court declined jurisdiction on account of the
nature of the title and the method and purpose of its acquirement, and see as to validity of assignment, Walker v. Bradford Bank, 12 Q. B. D. 1883, 84, 511.

The history of our country shows that the government has

A State is not liable to suit upon its bonds either by an
individual or another State. Such suits against States were
unheard of at the time of the adoption of the Constitution
and the power to bring them would not have been included if
the proposition had been made. Bank of Ifashingtonv. Arkansas, 20 How. 530, 532; Webster's Opinion to Baring Bros.

A suit cannot usually be maintained against a State
to compel the payment of its debts, as it might necessitate an
interference with, if not the complete control and direction of,
the legislative function of assessing, levying, collecting and
distributing taxes, which is, as yet, beyond the competency of
courts; there is no means of rendering the decree effective,

unless this court is prepared to appoint a receiver with the
extraordinary powers of taking charge of and administering
the affairs of a delinquent State. The separation and careful
demarkation of the functions of government into executive,
legislative and judicial, is the distinguishing characteristic of

can transgress its proper bounds. People ex rel. Broderiek v.

Conflict of Laws, 212; see United States v. Guthrie, 17 How.
284, 303. The States are sovereign within the province of
their reserved powers, including the management of their
fiscal affairs. By the constitution of North Carolina, Art. 14,
sec. 3, "no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law;" and the courts cannot direct the State Treasury to pay a claim against the State,
however just and unquestioned, where there is no legislative
appropriation to pay the same. Garner v. lForth, 122 N. C.

In many of the cases in this court in which attempts
have been made to collect debts from States, there have been
strong intimations that over and above the objection that
States are exempt from suit by the Eleventh Amendment,
courts had no process by which they could collect debts
from States. Jlarye v. Parsons,114 U. S.325 ; In re Ayers,

If a suit can be brought upon the bonds of a State by
another State, no such suit can be brought upon bonds trans-,
ferred to the State merely because the holder of them cannot
collect them.
If for any reason the court can take jurisdiction of a suit
against a State for the collection of a debt its compulsive
process should be confined to debts due directly to the complaining States upon dealings, contracts, transactions between
the States, or at any rate to obligations acquired "in due
course of trade," if such an acquisition be possible. 1 Kent's
Commentaries, 297, note d; Langdell's Treatise on Equity
Pleading, 209; and see Fed. Cas. No. 1007.
Jurisdiction over controversies between two or more States
was given to the Supreme Court for the purpose of settling
disputes-allaying strife-and not for the purpose of fomenting
quarrels. What surer method of arousing jealousies, engendering hostilities and retaliations can be conceived than by
encouraging such suits between States? Such, at any rate, is
the teaching of experience.
A sovereign State cannot be forced into court against her
consent; but a cross bill presupposes that the plaintiff is already
in court rightfully, and when the State comes into court of
her own accord and invokes its aid, she is, of course, bound
by all the rules established for the administration of justice
between individuals. P. 1. & A. By. Co. v. So. Car., 60

The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment and the alarm
over the decision in the Chisholm case -vas not so much the
apprehension of a loss of dignity in being haled before a court,
as the danger of being compelled, by legal process, to pay
their debts-the danger of having their complex fiscal affairs
taken out of the control of the proper state officers and placed
in the hands of this court. Co1hens v. Vrirginia, 6 Wheat. 246,

Individuals should not be allowed to enforce compromises for
one State by threat of assignment to another State. Taking
jurisdiction of this action would result in a vast number of
similar claims being made which would not be confined exclusively to public securities but would extend to claims of all
kinds. What then becomes of the reserved rights of the States
to manage their own domestic affairs ? There is scarcely
any State which may not be thus called -to the bar of this
court. Even in Massachusetts claims have been made which
the Supreme Court of that State regarded as just, as between
man and man, but which it could not enforce against the State
for lack of jurisdiction. .lfurdock Grate Co. v. Commonwealth,

court; we have lived for more than a century without its exercise; that it does not exist is made probable by the fact that
it has not previously been invoked, although the circumstances
which gave rise to it have existed from the beginning. The
novelty of an action, under such circumstances, is strong evidence that it is groundless. 2ississipi v. Johnson, 4 Wall.

Even if suits can be brought against a State upon bonds so
assigned to another State, the present suit cannot be maintained, because it is a suit by the State of South Dakota and
an individual representing all individual bondholders of the
same class, against the State of North Carolina and another
representing all the first mortgage bondholders. I Daniel's

If this be required merely because the Judiciary Act only
confers jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of controversies between the citizens of different States, a fortiori,ought it to be
so held when the Constitution confers jurisdiction upon this
court.only of controversies between two or more States and
the Eleventh Amendment expressly prohibits suits by individuals against a State?
Nor is it possible to escape the force of this argument by
saying that the individuals are not necessary parties to the
suit. It would scarcely lie in the mouth of the complainant
to say this, because she has elected to bring the suit in the
present form and with the present parties, but, if she did, the
objection would be futile, because they are necessary parties.

Even if the parties were re-arranged according to their real
interest in the controversy, the result of a successful prosecution of this suit will equally be to enable the individual holders

suit against her consent, contrary to the provisions of the
Eleventh Amendment, which would contravene the spirit
of the amendment.
The general rule for the construction of a constitutional
provision is so to construe it as to subserve its general purpose, -Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 531, aud that rule has

To sustain this action and give judgment in accordance with
the prayer will be to accomplish an unconstitutional result,
and that by indirection.
This suit is commenced and prosecuted by, or for the benefit of, individuals.

Under Few Hampshirev. Louisiana,108

U. S. 76, 89, an individual cannot invoke the original jurisdiction of this court in a suit against one State by using the
name of another State-a State cannot maintain a suit against
another State on behalf of private individuals.
The facts clearly show that the suit was commenced, and
is prosecuted, solely for the benefit of the private bondholders,
and in the event of recovery they are the sole beneficiaries
after deducting, of course, the expenses of the suit, including
the fee to South Dakota. The prohibitions of the Eleventh
Amendment can not so easily be nullified.
On the merits; the bonds were disposed of contrary to the
provisions of the enabling statute, c. 228, Acts North Carolina, 1854, 55, and are, therefore, illegal and uncollectible.
See §§ 8, 35, 37.
As to the position of complainant that whether the bonds
were illegally issued and sold or not, is immaterial to a holder
for value in due course, it must be, of course, through the merit
of some antecedent holder, for complainant not only took the
bonds after their maturity, but paid nothing for them.
Admitting presumptions in favor of a holder of negotiable
paper, the law is that when proof has been given of fraud or

illegality in the issue of paper, the burden is cast upon complainant to show that it is a purchaser for value without
notice and in due course. Smith v. Sac County, 11 Wall. 139;
Combs v. Bodge, 21 How. 397; Collins v. Gilvert, 94 U. S.
753; Stewa t v. -Lansing,104 U. S. 505.
As these bonds were issued and disposed of contrary to the
provisions of the enabling statute, they were illegal, and complainant's receiving the bonds as a donation, and after their
maturity, casts the burden of proof upon her to show that some

one of her predecessors in title were innocent purchasers for
value, and this she has not done.
As the Schafers, who are the only persons whose title complainant rests upon, purchased these state bonds with overdue interest coupons attached and at a small percentage of
their face value, they are deprived of the protection given
to bona fide purchasers for value in due course. B'ulbert v.
Douglas, 94: N. 0. 122; Farthing v. Dark, 109 N. C. 291;
Parsons v. Jackson, 99 *U.S. 434, 444; 9 Rose's Notes, 737;
Railway Co. v. Sprague, 103 U. S. 756; London Joint Stock
Bank v. Sim mwns, 1892, A. 0. 201, 221. The circumstances
were sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that there
was something wrong, and inquiry would have disclosed that
they were not issued in accordance with the statute. Trask
v. Jacksonville &c. 1R. R. Co., 124: U. S. 515.
If, however, the Schafers were bona fde holders for value,
as the bonds were not suable in their hands, they ought not
to become suable in the hands of a transferee unless that transferee took them for value and without notice of dishonor,
even if such controversies are within the jurisdiction of this
court. A transferee has no higher or further rights than the
transferrer, unless in the exceptional cases under our recording
acts and negotiable paper taken for value before maturity and
without notice. To permit the State of South Dakota to collect these bonds by suit, whether they were illegally issued
or not, will be to add another exception to the rule that a man
cannot give what he does not own or possess.
The provisions of the law, Act, 1866, 61, North Carolina,
chapter 106, authorizing a mortgage upon the State's stock in
the-North Carolina Railroad in favor of the holders of the
bonds of the class sued on were not complied with, and the
mortgage is invalid.
In the indorsement upon the bonds, purporting to give a
statutory mortgage upon the State's stock, no stock was designated or described in such way as to be capable of identification, and, therefore, no particular stock has been subjected to
the lien of a mortgage. The statute authorized a mortgage in
favor of the holders of the bonds, but it has never been exe-

cuted, and the only claim which the holders of the mortgage
have against the State is, not a lien upon any particular stook
owned by the State, but a cause of action for the breach of
contract to give the mortgage. In North Carolina, by whose
law the validity of the mortgage is to be determined, a mortgage purporting to be upon a certain number of things, out of
a larger number, and in no other wise designated, is invalid as
a mortgage. Waldo v. Belcher, 11 Iredell L. 609 ; Blackley
v. Patrick,67 N. C. 40 ; Stevenson,v. Railroad,86 N. C. 445 ;
Holmes v. Whitaker, 119 N. C. 113; Jones on Chattel Mortgages, 56; Kilgore v. New Orleans (as Co., 2 Woods, 144.
The claim on behalf of the mortgage is not stronger in equity
than at law, because in order to constitute an equitable mortgage, it is equally necessary to identify the subject-matter.
Halroyd v. iltarshall,10 H. L. 189; Walker v. Brown, 165 U.
S. 654; 19 Enc. of Law, page 14, and authorities. The same
rule prevails in actions for the specific performance of a contract. Lighthouse v. Third _ational Bank, 162 N. Y. 336.

the obligation of a State to pay its debts, see Louisiana v.
Jumnel, 107 U. S. 740; lurrayv. Charleston, 96 U. S. 445.
MR. JUSTICE BREWiR, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
There can be no reasonable doubt of the validity of the
bonds and mortgages in controversy. There is no challenge
of the statutes by which they were authorized. By those
statutes the treasurer was directed, when it-became necessary
to borrow money for the payment of the subscription, to prepare coupon bonds and advertise in one or more newspapers
for sealed proposals, and to accept the terms offered most advantageous to the State, provided that in no event should the
bonds be sold for less than their par value. The advertisement
was made, no bids were received, but the bonds were delivered
to the railroad company as payment for the subscription,
dollar for dollar. Upon each bond was placed the statutory
pledge or mortgage. It is true no money was paid into the
treasury and thence out of the treasury to the railroad company, yet looking at the substance of the transaction (and
equity has regard to substance rather than form), the transaction was the same as though the company had been the only
bidder, had placed a thousand dollars in the treasury in payment of each bond and received that thousand dollars back
from the treasury in payment of the subscription for ten shares
of stock. It is true also that there was no formal issue of certificates by the company to the State, but that was a matter of
arrangement between the parties to the subscription. The
State's right as a stockholder was not abridged by lack of the
certificates, and in fact it has been receiving dividends on the
stock exactly as though certificates had been issued. The statute also provided that with each several bond a deed of mortgage for an equal amount of stock, signed by the treasurer and
countersigned by the comptroller, should constitute a part of
the bond and be transferable in like manner with it, "and
further, that such mortgage shall have all the force and effect

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

in law and equity, of registered mortgages without actual
registry." While no certificate of stock was to be attached to
or go with the bond the statute evidently contemplated that
the mortgage endorsed on the bond should have the same
force and effect. Hence, when the endorsement was made and
the bond issued by the State it was tantamount to a separation
and identification of the number of shares named therein. It
cannot be that the State having provided this means of giving
to each bond the mortgage security of the corresponding shares
of stock can now prevent the attaching of the lien on the
ground that no shares had been separated and no certificate
transferred. It is unnecessary to refer to chap. 98 of the
Laws of 1879, for that act was one in the nature of an offer to
compromise, although it does contain a recognition of outstanding obligations.
Neither can there be any question respecting the title of South
Dakota to these bonds. They are not held by the State as
representative of individual owners, as in the case of _New
IRam~p6dre v. Louisiana,108 U. S. '76, for they were given
outright and absolutely to the State. It is true that the gift
may be considered a rare and unexpected one. Apparently
the statute of South Dakota was passed in view of the expected gift, and probably the donor made the gift under a
not unreasonable expectation that South Dakota would bring
an action against North Carolina to enforce these bonds, and
that such action might enure to his benefit as the owner of
other like bonds. But the motive with which a gift is made,
whether good or bad, does not affect its validity or the question of jurisdiction. This has been often ruled. In _fcDonald v. Smalley, 1 Pet. 620, an objection to the jurisdiction
on the ground that the title to the property in controversy
had been conveyed to the plintiff in the belief that it would
be sustained by the Federal when it would not be by the state
court, was overruled, with this observation by Chief Justice
Marshall (p. 624):
"This testimony, which is all that was laid before the court,

tained an action for his debt, nor McArthur a suit for his land.
His title to it was extinguished, and the consideration was received. The motives which induced him to make the contract,
whether justifiable or censurable, can have no influence on its
validity. They were such as had sufficient influence with
himself, and he had a right to act upon them. A court cannot enter into them when deciding on its jurisdiction. The
conveyance appears to be a real transaction, and the real as
well as nominal parties to the suit, are citizens of different
States."
See also smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198; Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280 ; Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co, 176 U. S.
181, 190, 191, 192. In this last case Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court, said:
"If the law concerned itself with the motives of parties new
complications would be introduced into suits which might
seriously obscure their real merits. If the debt secured by a
mortgage be justly due, it is no defence to a foreclosure that
the mortgagee was animated by hostility or other bad motive.

analogous cases. Thus, it is well settled that a mere colorable
conveyance of property, for the purpose of vesting title in a
non-resident and enabling him to bring suit in a Federal court,
will not confer jurisdiction; but if the conveyance appear to
be a real transaction, the court will not, in deciding upon the
question of jurisdiction, inquire into the motives which actuated
the parties in making the conveyance. .aDonald v. Smalley,

The title of South Dakota is as perfect as though it had received these bonds directly from iNorth Carolina. We have,
therefore, before us the case of a State with an unquestionable
title to bonds issued by another State, secured by a mortgage
of railroad stock belonging to that State, coming into this
court and invoking its jurisdiction to compel payment of those
bonds and a subjection of the mortgaged property to the satisfaction of the debt.
Has this court jurisdiction of such a controversy, and to
what extent may it grant relief ? Obviously that jurisdiction
is not affected by the fact that the donor of these bonds could
not invoke it. The payee of a foreign bill of exchange may
not sue the drawer in the Federal court of a State of which
both are citizens, but that does not oust the court of jurisdiction of an action by a subsequent holder if the latter be a
citizen of another State. The question of jurisdiction is determined by the status of the present parties, and not by that
of prior holders of the thing in controversy. Obviously, too,
the subject-matter is one of judicial cognizance. If anything
can be considered as justiciable it is a claim for money due on
a written promise to pay-and if it be justiciable does it matter
how the plaintiff acquires title, providing it be honestly acquired? It would seem strangely inconsistent to take jurisdiction of an action by South Dakota against North Carolina
on a promise to pay made by the latter directly to the former,
and refuse jurisdiction of an action on a like promise made by
the latter to an individual and by him sold or donated to the
former.
A preliminary question arises from the fact that representatives of the two classes of bonds are made defendants, and
that a part of the relief asked is a sale of the thirty thousand
shares of stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company,
belonging to the State of North Carolina, in satisfaction and
discharge of all the mortgages upon such stock. It is insisted

SOUT

DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
Opinion of the Court.

that these individuals, owners of the bonds, although named
as defendants, are in fact occupying an adverse position to
that of the State, and that the effect of their presence as parties
is a practical nullification of the Eleventh Amendment, in
that it is giving to individuals relief by judgment against the
State. Apparently one expectation of the donor to South
Dakota was that in some way the bonds retained by himself
would be placed in judgment and relief obtained against North
Carolina in the suit commenced by South Dakota. But we
think that these individuals are not necessary parties-defendant, and that no relief should be given to them or to the classes
of bondholders they represent. The statute under which the
mortgage was executed provided that with each of the bonds
a deed of mortgage for a like amount of stock should be executed by the State. There is, therefore, a separate mortgage
of ten shares of stock on each one of these bonds, and that
mortgage can be fully satisfied by a decree of foreclosure and
sale of the ten shares of stock. No one would doubt that, if a
certificate of stock was attached as a pledge to a note, the
pledge could be satisfied by a sale of the stock without any
determination of the rights of the purchaser as between himself and other stockholders. And such was the manifest purpose of this legislation. It contemplated that each bondholder should receive a stock security which he could realize
on without the delay and expense of a suit to which all other
stockholders and the corporation would be necessary .parties.
The purchaser at the sale to be authorized by this decree will
become vested with the full title of the State to the number
of shares of stock stated in the mortgage. He will occupy the
sane position in relation to the corporate property that other
stockholders occupy, and have whatever rights they have.
It is not necessary for a full satisfaction of the mortgage on one
of these bonds that any other mortgage upon another bond be
also foreclosed, or that a decree be entered determining what
rights the purchaser will have by virtue of the stock which he
obtains at the sale. So far then as these individual defend-

ants are concerned, the suit will be dismissed with costs against
South Dakota.
Coming now to the right of South Dakota to maintain this
suit against North Carolina, we remark that it is a controversy
between two States; that by see. 2, art. III, of the Constitution
this court is given original jurisdiction of "controversies between two or more States." In Missouri v. Illinois and the
Sanitary District of Chicago, 180 U. S. 208, Mr. Justice Shiras,
speaking for the court, reviewed at length the history of the
incorporation of this provision into the Federal Constitution
and the decisions rendered by this court in respect to such
jurisdiction, closing with these words (p. 240):
"The cases cited show that such jurisdiction has been exercised in cases involving boundaries and jurisdiction over lands
and their inhabitants, and in cases directly affecting the property rights and interests of a State."
The present case is one "directly affecting the property
rights and interests of a State."
Although a repetition of this review is unnecessary, two or
three matters are worthy of notice. The original draft of the
Constitution reported to the convention gave to the Senate
jurisdiction of all disputes and controversies "between two or
more States, respecting jurisdiction or territory," and to the
Supreme Court jurisdiction of "controversies between two or
more States, except such as shall regard territory or jurisdiction." A claim for money due being a controversy of a justiciable nature, and one of the most common of controversies,
would seem to naturally fall within the scope of the jurisdiction thus intended to be conferred upon the Supreme Court.
In the subsequent revision by the convention the power given
to the Senate in respect to controversies between the States
was stricken out as well as the limitation upon the jurisdiction
of this court, leaving to it in the language now found in the
Constitution jurisdiction without any limitation of "controversies between two or more States."
The Constitution as it originally stood also gave to this

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NOR1H CAROLINA.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

court jurisdiction of controversies "between a State and citizens of another State." Under that clause Chisholm v. Georgia,
2 Dall. 419, was decided, in which it was held that a citizen of
one State might maintain in this court an action of assumpsit
against another State. In consequence of that decision the
Eleventh Amendment was adopted, which provides that "the
judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted
against one of the United States by citizens of another State,
or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State." It will be
perceived that this amendment only granted to a State immunity from suit by an individual, and did not affect the
jurisdiction over controversies between two or more States.
In respect to this it was said by Chief Justice Marshall in
Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406:
"It is a part of our history, that, at the adoption of the
Constitution, all the States were greatly indebted; and the
apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the
Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted; and the court maintained
its jurisdiction. The alarm was general; and, to quiet the
apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the state
legislatures. That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty of a State from the degradation supposed to attend a
compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the nation, may
be inferred from the terms of the amendment. It does not
comprehend controversies between two or more States, or between a State and a foreign State. The jurisdiction of the
court still extends to these cases: and in these a State may
still be sued. We must ascribe the amendment, then, to some
other cause than the dignity of a State. There is no difficulty
in finding this cause. Those who were inhibited from commencing a suit against a State, or from prosecuting one which
might be commenced before the adoption of the amendment,
were persons who might probably be its creditors. There was
not much reason to fear that foreign or sister States would

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason
to retain the jurisdiction of the court in those cases, because it
might be essential to the preservation of peace. The amendment, therefore, extended to suits commenced or prosecuted
by individuals, but not to those brought by States."
In the same case, after referring to the two classes of cases,
jurisdiction of which was vested in the courts of the Union,
he said (p. 378):
"In the second class, the jurisdiction depends entirely on
the character of the parties. In this are comprehended ' controversies between two or more States, between a State and
citizens of another State,' and ' between a State and foreign
States, citizens or subjects.' If these be the parties it is entirely
unimportant what may be the subject of controversy. Be it
what it may, these parties have a constitutional right to come
into the courts of the Union."
In R1ode Island v. -Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, this court
sustained its jurisdiction of a suit in equity brought by one
State against another to determine a dispute as to boundary,
and in the course of the opinion, by MAr. Justice Baldwin, said
in respect to the immunity of a sovereign from suit by an individual (p. 720):
"Those States, in their highest sovereign capacity, in the
convention of the people thereof,

.

.

.

adopted the Con-

stitution, by which they respectively made to the United
States a grant of judicial power over controversies between
two or more States. By the Constitution, it was ordained
that this judicial power, in cases where a State was a party,
should be exercised by this court as one of original jurisdiction. The States waived their exemption from judicial power,
(6 Wheat. 378, 380,) as sovereigns by original and inherent
right, by their own grant of its exercise over themselves in
such cases, but which they would not grant to any inferior
tribunal. By this grant, this court has acquired jurisdiction
over the parties in this cause, by their own consent and delegated authority; as their agent for executing the judicial
power of the United States in the cases specified."
And, again, in reference to the extent of the jurisdiction of
this court (p. 721):

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court

"That it is a controversy between two States, cannot be
denied; and though the Constitution does not, in terms, extend the judicial power to all controversies between two or
more States, yet, it in terms excludes none whatever may be
their nature or subject."
In United States v. .YortA Carolina,136 U. S. 211, we took
jurisdiction of an action brought by the United States against
North Carolina to recover interest on bonds, and decided the
case upon its merits. It is true there was nothing in the
opinion in reference to the matter of jurisdiction, but as said
in United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 642:
"The cases in this court show that the framers of the Constitution did provide, by that instrument, for the judicial determination of all cases in law and equity between two or
more States, including those involving questions of boundary.
Did they omit to provide for the judicial determination of
controversies arising between the United States and one or
more of the States of the Union? This question is in effect
answered by United States v. NYortA Carolina, 136 U. S. 211.
That was an action of debt brought in this court by the United
States against the State of North Carolina upon certain bonds
issued by that State. The State appeared, the case was determined here upon its merits and judgment was rendered for
the State. It istrue that no question was made as to the
jurisdiction of this court, and nothing was therefore said in
the opinion upon that subject. But it did not escape the attention of the court, and the judgment would not have been
rendered except upon the theory that this court has original
jurisdiction of a suit by the United States against a State."
See also United States v. .ichigan, 190 U. S. 379, decided
at the last term, in which a bill in equity for an accounting
and a recovery of money was sustained. Mr. Justice Peckham, delivering the unanimous opinion of the court, said
(pp. 396, 406):
"By its bill the United States invokes the original jurisdiction of this court for the purpose of determining a controversy
existing between it and the State of Michigan. This court
has jurisdiction of such a controversy, although it is not lit-

must be judgment overruling the demurrer, but as the defendant may desire to set up facts which it might claim would be
a defence to the complainant's bill, we grant leave to the defendant to answer up to the first day of the next term of this
court. In case it refuses to plead further, the judgment will
be in favor of the United States for an accounting and for the
payment of the sum found due thereon."
We are not unmindful of the fact that in H~ansv. Louisiana,
134 U. S. 1, Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the
court, expressed his concurrence in the views announced by
Mr. Justice Iredell, in the dissenting opinion in Chisholm v.
Georgia, but such expression cannot be considered as a judgment of the court, for the point decided was that, construing
the Eleventh Amendment according to its spirit rather than
by its letter, a State was relieved from liability to suit at the
instance of an individual, whether one of its own citizens or a
citizen of a foreign State. Without noticing in detail the other
cases referred to by Mr. Justice Shiras in _fissouri v. Illinois
et al., supra, it is enough to say that the clear import of the
decisions of this court from the beginning to the present time
is in favor of its jurisdiction over an action brought by one
State against another to enforce a property right. Chisholm
v. Georgia was an action of assumpsit, United States v. Torth
Carolinaan action of debt, United States v. Mlic igan a suit
for an accounting, and that which was sought in each was a
money judgment against the defendant State.
But we are confronted with the contention that there is no
power in this court to enforce such a judgment, and such lack
of power is conclusive evidence that, notwithstanding the general language of the Constitution, there is an implied exception of actions brought to recover money. The public property held by any municipality, city, county or State is exempt
from seizure upon execution because it is held by such corporation, not as a part of its private assets, but as a trustee for
public purposes. _-Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, 513.

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

As a rule no such municipality has any private property subject to be taken upon execution. A levy of taxes is not within
the scope of the judicial power except as it commands an inferior municipality to execute the power granted by the legislature.
In Bees v. City of Watertown, 19 Wall. 107, 116, 111, we
said:"1Weare of the opinion that this court has not the power to
direct a tax to be levied for the payment of these judgments.
This power to impose burdens and raise money is the highest
attribute of sovereignty, and is exercised, first, to raise money
for public purposes only; and, second, by the power of legislative authority only. It is a power that has not been extended to the judiciary. Especially is it beyond the power of
the Federal judiciary to assume the place of a State in the exercise of this authority at once so delicate and so important."
See also Heine v. The Levee Commissioners, 19 Wall. 655,
661; .eriwether v. Garrett, supra.
In this connection reference may be made to United States
v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, in which an application was made
for a mandamus against the Secretary of the Treasury to compel the payment of an official salary, and in which we said
(p. 303):
"The only legitimate inquiry for our determination upon
the case before us is this: Whether, under the organization of
the Federal government or by any known principle of law,
there can be asserted a power in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Columbia, or in this court, to
command the withdrawal of a sum or sums of money from the
Treasury of the United States, to be applied in satisfaction of
disputed or controverted claims against the United States?
This is the question, the very question presented for our determination; and its simple statement would seem to carry with
it the most startling considerations-nay, its unavoidable negation, unless this should be prevented by some positive and
controlling command; for it would occur, a priori, to every
mind, that a treasury, not fenced round or shielded by fixed
and established modes and rules of administration, but which

could be subjected to any number or description of demands,
asserted and sustained through the undefined and undefinable
discretion of the courts, would constitute a feeble and inadequate provision for the great and inevitable necessities of the
nation. The government under such a regime, or, rather, under such an absence of all rule, would, if practicable at all, be
administered, not by the great departments ordained by the
Constitution and laws, and guided by the modes therein prescribed, but by the uncertain and perhaps contradictory action of the courts, in the enforcement of their views of private
interests."
Further, in this connection may be noticed Gordon v. United
States, 117 U. S. 697, in which this court declined to take
jurisdiction of an appeal from the Court of Claims, under the
statute as it stood at the time of the decision, on the ground
that there was not vested by the act of Congress power to
enforce its judgment. We quote the following from the
opinion, which was the last prepared by Chief Justice Taney
(pp. 702, 704):
"The award of execution is a part, and an essential part of
every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power.
It is no judgment, in the legal sense of the term, without it.
Without such an award the judgment would be inoperative
and nugatory, leaving the aggrieved party without a remedy. . . . Indeed, no principle of constitutional law has
been more firmly established or constantly adhered to, than
the one above stated-that is, that this court has no jurisdiction in any case where it cannot render judgment in the legal
sense of the term; and when it depends upon the legislature
to carry its opinion into effect or not, at the pleasure of Congress." See also 1n 'e Sanborn, 148 U. S. 222, and La Abra
Silver Mlfining Campany v. United States, 175 U. S. 423, 456.
We have, then, on the one hand the general language of the
Constitution vesting jurisdiction in this court over "controversies between two or more States," the history of that jurisdictional clause in the convention, the cases of Chisholm v.
Georgia, United States v. iVorth Carolinaand United States v.
Miehigan, (in which this court sustained jurisdiction over actions

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.

to recover money from a State,) the manifest trend of other
decisions, the necessity of some way of ending controversies
between States, and the fact that this claim for the payment
of money is one justiciable in its nature; on the other, certain
expression of individual opinions of justices of this court, the
difficulty of enforcing a judgment for money against a State,
by reason of its ordinary lack of private property subject to
seizure upon execution, and the absolute inability of a court to
compel a levy of taxes by the legislature. Notwithstanding
the embarrassments which surround the question it is directly
presented and may have to be determined before the case is
finally concluded, but for the present it is sufficient to state the
question with its difficulties.
There is in this case a mortgage of property, and the sale
of that property under a foreclosure may satisfy the plaintiff's
claim. If that should be the result there would be no necessity for a personal judgment against the State. That the State
is a necessary party to the foreclosure of the mortgage was
settled by Christian v. Atlantic & _NYorth Carolina Railroad
Company, 133 U. S. 233. Equity is satisfied by a decree for
a foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property, leaving the
question of a judgment over for any deficiency, to be determined when, if ever, it arises. And surely if, as we have often
held, this court has jurisdiction of an action by one State against
another to recover a tract of land, there would seem to be no
doubt of the jurisdiction of one to enforce the delivery of personal property.
A decree will, therefore, be entered, which, after finding the
amount due on the bonds and coupons in suit to be twentyseven thousand four hundred dollars ($27,400), (no interest
being recoverable, United States .v. Vorth Carolina,136 U. S.
211), and that the same are secured by one hundred shares of
the stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company, belonging
to the State of North Carolina, shall order that the said State
of North Carolina pay said amount with costs of suit to the
State of South Dakota on or before the 1st Monday of January, 1905, and that in default of such payment an order of
sale be issued to the Marshal of this court, directing him to sell

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom concurred MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, MR. JUSTICE MOKENNA& and MR. JUSTICE DAY,
dissenting.

The decision in this case seems to me to disregard an express and absolute prohibition of the Constitution. The facts
are stated in the opinion of the court. As, however, there
are some facts deemed by me to be material, which are not
referred to, it is proposed to make a summary of the case,
and then express the reasons which control me.
In the years 1847 and 1855 the negotiable bonds of the State
of North Carolina were issued to aid in the construction of
the railway of the North Carolina Railroad Company and
were exchanged for the stock of that company. The bonds
went into the hands of individuals and the exchanged stock
passed into the possession of the State, and was declared to
be pledged in the hands of the State to secure the payment of
the bonds in question.
In 1855 and 1866 similar aid was given to another railway,
the Western North Carolina. Bonds, each for the par value
of one thousand dollars, aggregating nearly two and a half
millions of dollars, were issued by the State. All the bonds,
which were issued after the passage, in 1866, of an act of the
legislature, were declared to be secured, as stated in the act,
by a mortgage of the stock of the North Carolina Railroad
held by the State and already, in its entirety, pledged for the
security of all the bonds which had been previously issued

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTM
192 U. S.

CAROLINA.

WHITE, J., The CHiEF JUSTICE, McKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. The stock, however, remained in possession of the State, but each of the
bonds thereafter issued contained an endorsement that ten
shares of stock of the North Carolina Railroad Company in
the hands of the State were mortgaged as security for the payment of each of the bonds.
Presumably, as a result of the disastrous consequences of
the civil war and the events which followed, the financial
affairs of the State of North Carolina in 1879 were profoundly
embarrassed. The State had not paid the interest as it accrued
on the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad.
It had in effect paid no interest whatever on the bonds issued
in favor of the Western North Carolina Railroad, and, indeed,
had defaulted generally in the payment of the interest on its
public debt. Statutes were passed by the State providing for
an adjustment of its financial affairs, so as to rehabilitate its
credit, in order that when the state debt was readjusted the
State might, for the benefit of all its people and its creditors,
be able to pay the interest on and provide for the principal of
the public debt. The adjustment made was accepted by those
holding the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad and they waived a very large sum of unpaid interest and
received new bonds, accompanied with a reiteration of the
pledge of all the stock of the North Carolina Railroad owned
by the State, which had always been held by the State as
security for the payment of all the bonds of that issue. It is
to be inferred from the record that the adjustment proposed
was generally accepted by the other creditors of the State,
and that as a consequence its fiscal affairs were placed upon a
sound basis. Be this a it - may, certain is it that the adjustment was accepted by the holders of a vast majority of the
bonds issued-in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad,
and that such holders surrendered their old bonds and took
new bonds of the State for twenty-five per cent of the face
value of their bonds, these new bonds not purporting to be
secured by any mortgage of the stock of the North Carolina
Railroad.
In 1901, twenty-two years after the passage of the acts re-

ferred to, and their acceptance as above stated, Simon Schafer
and his brother, composing the firm of Schafer & Brothers,
bankers and brokers in the city of New York, addressed a
petition to the legislature of North Carolina. Therein it was
recited that the parties named were the holders, in their own
right and as trustees, of nearly two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars of the bonds issued in aid of the Western North
Carolina Railroad Company, attached to which were unpaid
interest coupons for more than thirty years. The petitioners
declared that these bonds were substantially all the bonds of
the series then outstanding because the holders thereof had
not accepted the arrangement of 1879. It was stated that
such arrangements had been accepted by the vast majority of
others who held such bonds by reason of the financial stress
of the State at the time, and because those creditors knew that
the stock of the North Carolina Railroad mortgaged to secure
the bonds was of no avail for such purpose, since its value at
the time of the adjustment was not adequate to pay the bonds
issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad, in favor of which
it was first pledged. It was recited that the petitioners had
not availed of the adjustment because they preferred waiting
a restoration of the credit of the State, and trusted that the
stock of the North Carolina Railroad might ultimately prove
adequate to pay the bonds as reduced, issued in favor of the
North Carolina Railroad, and the small amount of bonds which
remained outstanding, as a result of the adjustment. It was
declared that this had been accomplished ; that in consequence
of the reduced amount of the North Carolina Railroad bonds
brought about by the adjustment, and the retirement thereby
effected of all the bonds of the Western North Carolina Railroad except the small amount held or represented by the
petitioners, the stock of the North Carolina Railroad held by
the State, if sold, would be adequate to pay both series and
leave a balance in favor of the State. Reciting that the petitioners and those they represented were aware that their
claims against the State could not be judicially enforced
either in the state or Federal courts, the prayer was that an
appropriation might be made to pay their bonds in principal

and accumulated interest, or that in default an act be passed
authorizing suit in the courts to enforce the mortgage lien
asserted to exist on the stock of the North Carolina Railroad.
The prayer of this petition was not granted.
Shortly following the failure to act favorably upon the petition just referred to, the act of the legislature of South Dakota, set out in the opinion of the court, was passed. It will
be observed that, among other things, it empowered the governor to accept gifts made to the State of bonds or choses in
action, and authorized the attorney general of the State, when
such gifts were accepted, to bring suit in the name of the
State to enforce payment of the same, and for that purpose "to
employ counsel to be associated with him in such suits or actions, who, with him, shall fully represent the State, and shall
be entitled to reasonable compensation (italics mine) out of
the recoveriesand collectionsin such suits and actions." Thereupon Simon Schafer addressed the letter to the Hon. Charles
H. Burke, a member of Congress from South Dakota, which is
reproduced in full in the opinion of the court. It suffices to
say that by that letter ten of the bonds were given to the
State of South Dakota, and it was especially mentioned that
the gift was made because Schafer was aware that he could
not sue the State of North Carolina, whilst the State of South
Dakota could do so. The letter also contained the suggestion,
presumably as an inducement to an acceptance by the State,
that if the ten bonds were enforced by the State of South Dakota, other gifts of similar bonds might be made. The bonds
were accepted by the governor of South Dakota, and the attorney general of that State thereupon filed the present bill.
The parties defendant were the State of North Carolina, a
person sued as representing all the holders of bonds issued in
aid of the North Carolina Railroad and a person sued as representative of the holders of the outstanding bonds issued in
aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad. The prayer of
the bill was in substance for a decree against the State .of
North Carolina for the amount of the principal of the bonds
and for more than thirty years' accrued interest; for an enforcement of the mortgage asserted to exist on the stock of

the North Carolina Railroad Company held by the State; for
a decree declaring that the holders of the bonds issued in
favor of the North Carolina Railroad Company had lost their
prior lien upon the whole stock by reason of their acceptance
of the compromise under the act of 1879, and the taking of
new bonds by them in pursuance thereof. It was, however,
prayed that in the event it should be found that the lien of
such bondholders on the stock had not been waived, the stock
be ordered sold free from all encumbrances to satisfy the
claims of the respective lienholders thereon, and that distribution be made of the proceeds of the stock among them according to priority.
The State answered, challenging the jurisdiction of this
court to entertain the bill, and also urging various defences on
the merits.
The person joined as representing the bonds issued in aid of
the North Carolina Railroad made no appearance. Charles
Salter, who was made defendant as representative of the
holders of the bonds issued in aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad, answered, substantially admitting all the allegations of the bill, but praying "that plaintiff's bill be dismissed with costs, unless the court shall decree that all the
stock subject to the second mortgage be sold for the benefit
of all the holders of said second mortgage bonds."
The court now decides that it has jurisdiction, because of
the delegation, in the second section of the third article of the
Constitution, of judicial power to the United States over "controversies between two or more States," and because of the
grant to this court of original jurisdiction over cases in which
a State shall be a party.
Whilst conceding that if the
holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad are necessary parties the jurisdiction would be ousted, it
is held that such bondholders are not necessary parties, since
there may be a sale to enforce complainant's rights of a portion of the stock held by the State of North Carolina, subject
to the prior rights therein of the holders of such bonds. The
decree which will be entered will, therefore, adjudge the State
of North Carolina to be indebted to South Dakota in the

amount of the principal of the ten bonds) with more than
thirty years' accrued interest. The decree will direct the sale
of the stock in the North Carolina Railroad Company held by
the State, subject to the prior pledge in favor of the holders
of the bonds of the North Carolina Railroad. The question
of a deficiency decree is reserved, in case, as a result of the
sale, the debt decreed against the State should not be extinguished.
With this summary of the pleadings, the facts, and the decision of the court in mind, I shall now state the reasons
which compel me to dissent, all of which may be embraced in
the two following general propositions which I shall examine
under separate headings: (A) The absolute want of power
in the court to render a decree between the two States on the
cause of action sued on; and (B) The want of power to render
the decree which is now directed to be entered, because of the
absence of essential parties whose presence would oust jurisdiction and the impotency to grant any relief whatever in the
absence of such parties.
(A.)
The absolute want of power in the court to r'ender a decree between the two States on the cause of action sued on.
-First. The power of this court to award a decree against
the State of North Carolina is based on the provision in the
second section of the third article of the Constitution, extending the judicial power of the United States over" controversies
between two or more States," and to the delegation to this
court of original jurisdiction over such controversies. If the
provisions in question were the only ones on the subject it
might be more difficult to deny that the Federal judicial power
embraced this controversy. Those provisions, however, do
not stand alone, since they must be considered in connection
with the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution, providing
that "the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or
prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of
another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state."

The question which the case involves is not what in a generic
sense may be considered a controversy between States, but
whether the particular claim here asserted by the State of
South Dakota is in any view such a controversy. It is also to
be observed that the questionis not whether a controversy between States may not rise from a debt originating as the result of a direct transaction between States, but is whether one
State can acquire a claim asserted against another State by a
citizen of that or of another State or an alien, and as a result
sue upon it, and thereby create a controversy between States
in a constitutional sense. Indeed, the question is narrower
than this, since in this case the alleged debtor State had years
before the transfer of the claim in question, while it was yet
owned by individuals, declined to recognize the debt, and had
refused payment thereof, as the result of a controversy between
itself and its alleged creditors.
I take it to be an elementary rule of constitutional construction that no one provision of the Constitution is to be segregated from all the others, and to be considered alone, but that
all the provisions bearing upon a particular subject are to be
brought into view and to be so interpreted as to effectuate
the great purposes of the instrument. If, in following this
rule, it be found that an asserted construction of any one provision of the Constitution would, if adopted, neutralize a positive prohibition of another provision of that instrument, then
it results that such asserted construction is erroneous, since its
enforcement would mean, not to give effect to the Constitution, but to destroy a portion thereof. My mind cannot escape the conclusion that if, wherever an individual has a claim,
whether in contract or tort, against a State, he may, by transferring it to another State, bring into play the judicial power
of the United States to enforce such claim, then the prohibition
contained in the Eleventh Amendment is a mere letter, without spirit and without force. This is said because no escape is
seen from the conclusion if the application of the prohibition
is to depend solely upon the willingness of the creditor of a
State, whether citizen or alien, to transfer, and the docility or
cupidity of another State in accepting such transfer, that the

provision will have no efficacy whatever. And this becomes
doubly cogent when the history of the Eleventh Amendment
is considered and the purpose of its adoption is borne in mind.
It is familiar that the amendment was adopted because of
the decision of this court in 1793, in Ciishlolm v. Georgia,
2 Dall. 419, holding that the grant of judicial power to the
United States to determine controversies between a State and
a citizen of another State vested authority to determine a controversy wherein a citizen of a State asserted a claim against
another State. That the purpose of the amendment was to
remove the possibility of the assertion of such a claim is aptly
shown by the passage from the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia,6 Wheat. 264, as quoted in the
opinion of the court in this case, saying (p. 406):
"It is a part of our history, that, at the adoption of the
Constitution, all the States were greatly indebted; and the
apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the
Federal courts, formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted; and the court maintained its
jurisdiction. The alarm was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the state
legislatures."
As the purpose of the amendment was to prohibit the enforcement of individual claims against the several States by
means of the judicial power of the United States, and as the
amendment was subsequent to the grant of judicial power made
by the Constitution, the amendment qualified the whole grant
of judicial power to the extent necessary to render it impossible by indirection to escape the operation of the avowed purpose which the people of the United States expressed in
adopting the amendment. How, as declared by Chief Justice
Marshall, could the adoption of the amendment have quieted
the apprehensions concerning the right to enforce private
claims against the States, if the power was left open after the
amendment to do so, if only they were transferred to another
State? It is also to be observed that the construction now
given causes the judicial power of the United States to embrace

claims not within even the reach of the ruling in Qldsholm v.
Georgia, for that case only decided that under the grant of
power a citizen of one State might sue another State. But
under the rule of construction, now announced, not only claims
held by citizens of other States and aliens, but those held by
a citizen of the State, become capable of enforcement, if only
the holders of such claims, after the State has refused to pay
them, choose to sell or make gift thereof to another State found
willing to become a party to a plan to evade a constitutional
provision inserted for the protection of all the States.
Let me, arguendo, grant that a case may be conceived of
where one provision of the Constitution can be so construed
as to render nugatory another and applicable provision. Even
such an impossible doctrine can have no relation to the case in
hand. The decisions of this court, rendered since the Eleventh
Amendment, have consistently held that that amendment embodied a principle of national public policy, whose enforcement
may not be avoided by indirection or subterfuge. Ought this
rule of public policy to be disregarded, by endowing every
State with the power of speculating upon stale and unenforceable claims of individuals against other States, thus not only
doing injustice, but also overthrowing the fiscal independence
of every State, and destroying that harmony between them
which it was the declared purpose of the Constitution to establish and cement ? Such a departure from the provisions of
the Eleventh Amendment, and the rule of national public policy which it embodies, may not be sustained by the assumption
that it would be unduly curtailing the independence of the
several States to deny them the right of enforcing, by the aid
of the Federal judicial power, claims against other States acquired from private individuals. For this assumption would
amount to this, that any and all of the States only enjoy the
essential privilege of being free from coercion as to the claims
of individuals, and have the power to manage their financial
affairs at the mere pleasure of any of the other States. This
is to say, that for the purpose of preserving the rights of the
States, those rights must be destroyed.
It is true that the greater number of cases decided by this

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.

WmT , J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, McKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

court concerning the right to enforce a private claim against a
State concerned controversies where suit was brought by citizens of other States or aliens, who were therefore persons expressly within the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. An
analysis of those cases, however, will show that they were decided, not upon the mere ground that the person who sued was
within the Eleventh Amendment, but upon the broad proposition that, by the effect of that amendment, claims of private
individuals could not be enforced against a State, and that in
upholding this constitutional limitation the court would look
at the real nature of the controversy, irrespective of the parties
on the record. If it were found by doing so that in effect the
consequence of the granting of the relief would be to enforce
by the Federal judicial power the claim of a private individual against a State, such relief would be denied. I content
myself with the reference in the margin to the leading cases
of this character,1 and come at once to consider the adjudications of this court rendered in two cases which directly related
to the operation of the prohibitions of the Eleventh AmendInent on the grant of judicial power to the United States over
controversies between States, and to two other cases which directly concerned the effect of the prohibitions of the Eleventh
Amendment in suits brought by persons who were within the
grant of the judicial power but were not embraced within the
category of persons specifically referred to in the Eleventh
Amendment. The first two cases referred to are New Ham.shire v. Louisiana and _Hew Yark v. -Louisiana. The opinion

of the court in both was delivered by Mr. Chief Justice Waite,
and is reported (1883) in 108 U. S. 76. The suits were originally brought in this court. The complainants were, in the
one case, the State of New Hampshire, and in the other the
State of iNew York; the principal defendant in both cases being the State of Louisiana. The complainant States asserted
the right to enforce certain pecuniary claims against the State
of Louisiana, as the holders of the naked legal title to certain
coupons and bonds of the State of Louisiana, which, pursuant
to legislative authority, by assignment, had been acquired from
citizens of the respective States, for the purpose of collection
for the benefit of such citizens. The defendant State challenged the jurisdiction of this court over the controversy. To
sustain such jurisdiction it was pressed by the complainant that
the bonds and coupons were negotiable instruments, of which
the assignee States became the legal owners, and that as such
they as a matter of law were the real parties in interest, whether
the transfer was a complete sale or merely made for the purpose of collection for the benefit of the assignors. The court
first considered the grant of judicial power to the United
States prior to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment and
held that as such power, when originally conferred, as interpreted in Misholm v. Georgia, embraced the right of a citizen
of one State to enforce his claims by suit directly against another State, a State could not, as the holder of the legal title,
champion for its citizens a right for the prosecution of which
a particular remedy had been provided by the Constitution.
Coming to generally consider the effect of the Eleventh Amendment as elucidated by the history connected with its adoption,
it was decided that as that amendment had expressly taken
away the right of a citizen of one State to sue another State, a
State could not enforce a right the assertion of which in the
courts was prohibited to the citizen himself. Noticing the contention that the grant of judicial power over controversies between States was but a substitute for the surrender to the
national government which each State had made, of the power
of prosecuting against another State, by force if necessary as a
sovereign trustee for its citizens, the claims of such citizens, the

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.

proposition was held not to be sustainable, under the Constitution of the United States. It was decided that the special
remedy originally granted to the citizen himself "must be
deemed to have been the only remedy the citizen of one State
could have under the Constitution against another State for
the redress of his grievances, except such as the delinquent
State saw fit itself to grant." Having announced this doctrine,
it was then, as an inevitable deduction from it decided that,
as the Eleventh Amendment had taken away the special remedy originally provided by the Constitution, there was no other
remedy whatever left. The opinion of the court concluded as
follows (p. 91):
"The evident purpose of the amendment, so promptly proposed and finally adopted, was to prohibit all suits against a
State by or for citizens of other States, or aliens, without the
consent of the State to be sued and, in our opinion, one State
cannot create a controversy with another State, within the
meaning of that term as used in the judicial clauses of the
Constitution, by assuming the prosecution of debts owing by
the other State to its citizens. Such being the case we are
satisfied that we are prohibited, both by the letter and the
spirit of the Constitution, from entertaining these suits, and
the bill in each case is dismissed."
To me it seems that this adjudication is conclusive of the
question now here. It in the broadest way determined that
the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment controlled the
grant of judicial power as to controversies between the States
so as to exclude the possibility of that grant vesting a State
with authority in any form, directly or indirectly, to set at
naught the Eleventh Amendment. The case was decided, not
upon the particular nature of the title of the bonds and coupons asserted by the States of New Hampshire and New
York, since it was conceded that, but for the Constitution, a
title such as that propounded would have given rise to an adequate cause of action. The ruling of the court was that, as
suits against a State upon the claims of private individuals were
absolutely prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment, such character of claim could not be converted into a controversy be-

tween States, and thus be made justiciable, since to do so
would destroy the prohibition which the Eleventh Amendment embodied. I do not perceive, if one State may not engender a controversy between States, in the constitutional
sense, in respect to claims arising out of dealings between a
State and individuals, how it was competent for the State of
South Dakota to create such a controversy by the acquisition
of a claim of the class whose enforcement it was the purpose
of the Eleventh Amendment to effectually prohibit. It is to
be observed that in the cases referred to the court did not
deny that a sovereign State, in virtue of its existence as such,
would not have possessed the inherent power to prosecute
against another State the claims of its citizens, and that such
a prosecution by it would have constituted a controversy between States in the international significance of those words.
But the court held that controversies between States, in the
constitutional sense, did not embrace rights of that character,
because of the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment, which
operated upon the whole grant of judicial power, including,
of course, such grant as to controversies between States.
The two other cases to which I have referred are Hans v.
louisiana, (1890) 134 U. S. 1, and Smith v. Reeves, (1900) 178
U. S. 436. In the first, the opinion of the court was delivered
by Mr. Justice Bradley; in the second, by Mr. Justice Harlan.
In H[Tans v. Louisiana, a suit was brought in the Circuit Court
of the United States against the State of Louisiana by a citizen
of that State, under the claim that the rights asserted arose
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and
therefore were not within the Eleventh Amendment, since
that amendment only prohibited suits against a State by a
citizen of another State or by aliens. The argument was
pressed that as the guarantees of the Constitution were allabiding, it would be against public policy to deprive a
citizen of the protection of the Constitution of the United
States by bringing him within the spirit when he was not
within the letter of the Eleventh Amendment. The court
answered the contention in the broadest possible way. It
held that the effect of the Eleventh Amendment was to qualify

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
192 U. S. WHE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, McKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

to the extent of its prohibitions, the whole grant of judicial
power, and, therefore, although a suit by a citizen of a State
against *aState to enforce assumed constitutional rights, wasnot within the letter of the amendment, it was within its
spirit, and there was no jurisdiction in the Federal courts over
such controversy. In summing up its general conclusions the
court said (p. 21):
"It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the reason or expediency of the rule which exempts a
sovereign State from prosecution in a court of justice at the
suit of individuals. This is fully discussed by writers on public
law. It is enough for us to declare its existence. The legislative department of a State represents its polity and its will;
and is called upon by the highest demands of natural and political law to preserve justice and judgments, and to hold inviolate the public obligations. Any departure from this rule,
except for reasons most cogent, (of which the legislature, and
not the courts, is the judge,) never fails in the end to incur the
odium of the world, and to bring lasting injury upon the State
itself. But to deprive the legislature of the power of judging
what the honor and safety of the State may require, even at
the expense of a temporary failure to discharge the public
debts, would be attended with greater evils than such failure
can cause."

Smith v. Reeves was an action brought in the Circuit Court
of the United States by a corporation created under an act of
Congress, against the treasurer of the State of California, to
obtain redress concerning certain taxes. The defendant challenged the jurisdiction upon the ground that in effect the action was one against a State. This court, concluding that the
State of California was the real party in interest, was led to
consider whether a Federal court was thereby deprived of jurisdiction. The contention on the part of the plaintiff was
that as a Federal corporation had a right to invoke, in virtue
of the law of its creation, the jurisdiction of the Federal courts,
the case was not controlled by the prohibitions of the Eleventh
Amendment forbidding suits against a State by citizens of
other States or aliens. The court, speaking through Mr. Jus-

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
WHrrE., J., The CHIF JUSTICE, MCKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting. 192 U. S.

tice Harlan, again adversely disposed of the contention, saying
(p. 446):
"If the Constitution be so interpreted it would follow that
any corporation created by Congress may sue a State in a Circuit Court of the United States upon any cause of action,
whatever its nature, if the value of the matter in dispute is sufficient to give jurisdiction. We cannot approve this interpretation."
After referring to the views expressed by Hamilton, Madison and Mlarshall, which were commented upon in Hans v.
.Louisiana,the court quoted approvingly the following passage
from the opinion in Hans v. .Louisianc:
"It seems to us that these views of those great advocates
and defenders of the Constitution were most sensible and just;
and they apply equally to the present case as to that then
under discussion. The letter is appealed to now, as it was
then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an individual
against a State. The reason against it is as strong in this case
as it was in that. It is an attempt to strain the Constitution
and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.
Can we suppose that, when the Eleventh Amendment was
adopted, it was understood to be left open for citizens of a
State to sue their own State in the Federal courts, whilst the
idea of suits by citizens of other States, or of foreign States,
was indignantly repelled? Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso
that nothing therein contained should prevent a State from
being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, can we imagine that it
would have been adopted by the States? The supposition
that it would is almost an absurdity on its face."
The opinion concluded as follows (p. 449):
"It could never have been intended to exclude from Federal
judicial power suits arising under the Constitution or laws of
the United States when brought against a State by private individuals or state corporations, and at the same time extend
such power to suits of like character brought by Federal corporations against a State without its consent."

WHnE, J., The CmrF JUsTICE, McKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

Here again I am unable to perceive any ground for taking
the case in hand out of the rulings made in the cases just reviewed. The letter of the Eleventh Amendment was just as
inapplicable to a suit by a citizen of a State against a State to
enforce his constitutional rights and to a suit by a Federal corporation, suing in the Federal court by virtue of its creation, as it
was to the grant of judicial power over controversies between
States. But the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment was
held to apply, because that amendment was again construed as
prohibiting the enforcement of claims by private individuals
against States through the judicial power of the United States,
without reference to the character of the person by whom the
claim was asserted. In other words, the decision was that the
operation of the Eleventh Amendment was to be determined,
not by the formal party complainant on the record, but by the
essential character and nature of the claim or right which was
asserted. This being the decision, how consistently can the
State of South Dakota be held to have power to give effect
to a character of claim as to which the Eleventh Amendment
declares the judicial power of the United States shall not extend.
Will not the accuracy of what I have just stated, as applied
to this case, be demonstrated by putting the question which
this court put in Hfrans v. Louisianaand approvingly reiterated
in Smith v. Beeves, and giving it the answer which the court
gave in those cases, changing, of course, the form of the question to meet the case now here. For this purpose, I repeat
the question, placing, however, in brackets the changed mode
of expression necessitated by the difference in the character of
the parties complainant. "Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso
that nothing therein contained should prevent a State from
being sued" [upon private claims due to its own citizens or to
aliens or citizens of other States, if only such claims'were sold
or otherwise disposed of long after the debtor State had refused
to pay them, so as to thus secure their judicial enforcement]
"can we imagine that the Eleventh Amendment would have
been adopted by the States? The supposition that it would
is almost an absurdity on its face."

Nor do I think the previous decisions of this court, which
are relied upon as establishing that the State of South Dakota
may maintain this suit, have any such tendency. Of course, it
is not by me denied that a dispute as to boundaries between
two States is judicially cognizable as a controversy between
States, and that such may also be the case where one State
asserts property rights against another, provided always that
the assertion of the particular right does not violate the
prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment. So, also, in my
opinion, United States v. iYorth Carolina, 136 U. S. 211, and
United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, instead of sustaining the
view that the cause of action here asserted can be treated, despite the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment, as a controversy between States, establish the contrary. In United
States v. .orth Carolina, the United States sued the State of
North Carolina concerning the interest on certain bonds. No
objection was taken by North Carolina to the jurisdiction of
the court, since that State voluntarily assented to a judicial
determination of the issue involved. There was, and could
have been, therefore, no question of jurisdiction, so far as the
State of North Carolina was concerned. The only question of
jurisdiction which could have arisen was whether a suit by the
United States against a State was within the constitutional
grant of judicial power. Although the court in its opinion in
United States v. .orth
carolina did not refer to the subject
of jurisdiction, it must be assumed that it was considered.
This is shown by a remark concerning United States v. North
Carolina,made by the court in the course of its opinion in
United States v. Texas, to the following effect:
"It is true that no question was made as to the jurisdiction
of this court, and nothing was therefore said in the opinion
upon that subject. But it did not escape the-attention of the
court, and the judgment would not have been rendered except
upon the theory that this court has original jurisdiction of a
suit by the United States against the State."
Those two cases, therefore, so far as jurisdiction is concerned,
simply determined that the grant of judicial power concerning controversies between States, whilst not in letter, ernbrac-

DAY, JJ., dissenting.

ing a suit brought by the United States against a State, in
spirit and purpose did give jurisdiction of a suit of that character. The effect of these rulings, then, was but to cause a
suit by the United States against a State to be within the
meaning of controversies between States. In other words, in
ascertaining the import of the grant of judicial power as to
controversies between States, the court gave force to the spirit
and purpose of the Constitution in order to include a suit by
the United States against a State within the category of controversies between States. This was simply applying the
same rule of construction to the grant of judicial power for
the purpose of including the United States, which had been
previously applied in Hans v. Louisiana,in Smith v. Beeves,
and in all the other cases to which I have referred, in order to exclude jurisdiction over controversies, to entertain which would
have been a violation of the spirit and purpose of the Eleventh
Amendment. When United States v. iorth Carolina and
United States v. Texas axe considered, it seems to me clear
that the decision now made not only is destructive of the inherent rights of the States as protected by the Eleventh
Amendment, but also strips the government of the United
States of its rights as a sovereign belonging to it under the
Constitution. As under the decisions referred to a suit between the United States and a State is within the grant of
judicial power over controversies between States, it must
follow that a suit by a State against the United States is also
of that character. Now, as the ruling is that such a controversy may include the claim of a private individual, if only
such claim be transferred to a State, it follows that a suit
by a State against the United States on a claim of that
character is within the grant of judicial power. Thus it
has come to pass that any and every claim against the
United States, what'ver be its character, is enforceable
against the United States if only a State chooses to acquire
and prosecute its enforcement. It is no answer to suggest that
such claims of private individuals are not justiciable unless the
law of the United States has caused them to be so, for if the
constitutional grant of judicial power embraces such contro-

versies as is now necessarily held, any restriction by Congress
would be repugnant to the Constitution.
My reason does not perceive how the principles which have
been stated and the rulings of this court enforcing them are
rendered inapplicable by the suggestion that, as the court may
not inquire into the motives actuating a particular transfer of
right, therefore it is without power to refuse to enforce in behalf of South Dakota the alleged gift. This proceeds upon
the assumption that the want of jurisdiction to enforce a private
claim against a State depends upon motive. But the absence
of such jurisdiction rests upon the constitutional prohibition
which addresses itself to the very nature of the cause of action
and imposes upon the court the duty to inquire into it. The
power of the court when such is the case, even in a case brought
in this court by one of the States of the Union to enforce an
alleged pecuniary right, is aptly illustrated by lFisconsin v.
Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265. There the State of
Wisconsin, having obtained a judgment against the defendant
corporation in the courts of Wisconsin, availed of the original
jurisdiction of this court to sue the defendant corporation to
enforce the judgment. It was held that, as the judgment was
for a penalty imposed by the laws of Wisconsin, and as penalties had no extraterritorial operation, the court would look at
the origin of the rights upon which the judgment was based,
and, doing so, declined to enforce the judgment. See also
.Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14. If, as the result of merely
a general rule of law against the extraterritorial operation of
statutory penalties, this court looked beyond the judgment
sued on by a State to the cause of action merged in the judgment, and refused relief, the court now must have the power
to look into the present cause of action and the origin of the
rights asserted by the State of South Dakota. To do otherwise seems to me is but to declare that a general principle of
law restricting the extraterritorial enforcement of penal
statutes must be held to have more sanctity than the declared
will of the people of the United States expressed in the Eleventh Amendment. Indeed, the existence of power in this court
to inquire into purpose and motive in suits brought by one

State against another State was directly upheld in Y1ew lamnp-

shire v. Louisiana and NVew York v. Louisiana, sup a. It
was not denied in those cases that the bonds sued upon were
negotiable, and that if the rules of law controlling in controversies between private individuals were to be applied, the title
of each plaintiff State to the bonds it sought recovery upon
could not be gainsaid, but should be regarded as absolute.
Coming, however, to enforce the provisions of the Eleventh
Amendment, the court held that it was its duty to depart
from the rule ordinarily applied and to examine into the nature
of the asserted rights, and if to give effect thereto would be
inconsistent with constitutional provisions, to refuse to lend
its aid to the enforcement of the claims.
Second. But putting out of view what seem to be the controlling principles previously stated, let me now look at the
controversy from a narrower point of view and consider the
rights of the parties by those considerations which would
apply to the enforcement of private rights. It is unquestioned
on the record that the bonds given to the State of South Dakota and upon which its action is based were past due at the
time of the gift, and that for more than twenty years prior to
the gift the State of North Carolina had, by her legislation,
held herself not bound to pay the same. That these facts
were known to the State of South Dakota when it accepted
the gift is shown. The makers of the gift could not transfer
to the State of South Dakota rights which they had not. In
other words, if when the gift was made that which was parted
with was not susceptible and had never been susceptible of
legal enforcement because not embodying a justiciable obligation against the State of North Carolina, the State of South
Dakota could not, by the acceptance of the gift, acquire greater
rights than were possessed by the transferrer. I take it to
be the elementary rule of public law that, whilst the contracts of a sovereign may engender natural or moral obligations, and are in one sense property, they are yet obligations
resting on the promise of the sovereign and possessing no
other sanction than the good faith and honor of the sovereign itself. These principles, as applied to the States of

this Union, are the necessary resultant of the adoption of the
Eleventh Amendment. It is not necessary to refer to opinions
of publicists on the general subject, since this court-as to
the States of the Union-has declared the doctrine so fully as
to leave it no longer an open question in this forum.
The concluding passages already quoted from the opinion
in Bans v. Louisiana, supra, approvingly referred to in
Smith v. Reeves, state the subject in the clearest possible way.
Prior to the cases just mentioned, however, this court in
numerous decisions had announced the same doctrine. A few
of the more important of those cases will now be briefly noticed. In _n 'e Ayers, (1887) 123 U. S.443, the court, speaking, through Mr. Justice Matthews, said (p. 504):
"It cannot be doubted that the 11th Amendment to the
Constitution operates to create an important distinction between contracts of a State with individuals and contracts
between individual parties. In the case of contracts between
individuals, the remedies for their enforcement or breach, in
existence at the time they were entered into, are a part of
the agreement itself, and constitute a substantial part of its
obligation. _Louisiana v. Niew Orleans,102 U. S.203. That
obligation, by virtue of the provision of article I, § 10, of the
Constitution of the United States, cannot be impaired by any
subsequent state legislation. Thus, not only the covenants
and conditions of the contract are preserved, but also the
substance of the original remedies for its enforcement. It is
different with contracts between individuals and a State. In
respect to these, by virtue of the 11th Amendment to the
Constitution, there being no remedy by a suit against the
State, the contract is substantially without sanction, except
that which arises out of the honor and good faith of the
State itself, and these are not subject to coercion. Although
the State may, at the inception of the contract, have consented as one of its conditions to subject itself to suit, it may
subsequently withdraw that consent and resume its original
immunity, without any violation of the obligation of its contract in the constitutional sense. Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How.
527; Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, 101 U. S. 337. The very

object and purpose of the 11th Amendment were to prevent
the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of
judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties. It was
thought to be neither becoming nor convenient that the several States of the Union, invested with that large residuum
of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United
States, should be summoned as defendants to answer the
complaints of private persons, whether citizens of other States
or aliens, or that the course of their public policy and the
administration of their public affairs should be subject to and
controlled by the mandates of judicial tribunals without their
consent, and in favor of individual interests. To secure the
manifest purposes of the constitutional exemption guaranteed
by the 11th Amendment requires that it should be interpreted,
not literally and too narrowly, but fairly, and with such
breadth and largeness as effectually to accomplish the substance of its purpose."
There is another and allied reason which seems to me
equally decisive against this claim. As will be observed from
the passage already quoted from the opinion of this court in
In 'eAyers 8upra, it was there affirmatively declared that

as the obligation of a State rested but on its conceptions of
moral duty, the State itself, under the great responsibilities
which attach to it as a sovereign, was the ultimate tribunal to
whom the creditor agreed at the very inception of the contract
to submit his rights. And that where a sovereign State, in
the discharge of the public duty thus resting upon it, declared against the payment of an obligation, such conclusion
by the sovereign was a determination by the tribunal which
had been impliedly agreed on and was binding upon the
creditor, and, as a result of the Eleventh Amendment, not
susceptible of review or change by the courts of the United
States. Applying this doctrine to this case it is apparent
that years before the transfer of the bonds to the State of
South Dakota, the State of North Carolina had, through
its duly constituted authorities, determined that the holder
of the bonds in question had not the right now asserted
by the State of South Dakota under the transfer from such

192 U. S.

creditor. This after all only serves additionally to demonstrate the fallacy underlying the assumption that the State of
South Dakota, because it is a State and may avail of the grant
of judicial power over controversies between States, can in doing so escape. the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment,
created for the very purpose of protecting the States and preserving their independent control over their own affairs. It
seems to me the gross inequality which must arise from disregarding the judgment of the tribunal selected by the creditor
is well illustrated by this case. When the facts which I have
at the outset stated are recalled, it will be observed that there
were about two and a half millions of dollars of outstanding
bonds of the same series as those now owned by the State of
South Dakota, and that that amount was reduced to about
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of principal, as a consequence of the conclusion of the State of North Carolina
concerning the exigencies of its financial situation. It is also
certain, when the facts stated in the petition presented to the
legislature of North Carolina by the assignor of the State of
South Dakota are recalled, that but for this vast reduction of
the debt produced by the determination of the State of North
Carolina, the alleged security now sought to be realized upon
by the State of South Dakota would be of no value. The
moral attitude shown by the record then is this, that the State
of South Dakota, as the mere beneficiary of the bounty of an
individual, seeks to derive all the benefit resulting from the
judgment of the State of North Carolina as to its public debt
and at the same time desires to repudiate that judgment, and
to obtain rights which never would have been within its reach
if the judgment of the State of North Carolina had not been
exercised. Under these circumstances it to me seems, even if
a court of equity was vested with power to disregard the final
judgment of the tribunal selected at the time the bonds were
issued, such court should not exercise that power in favor of
one standing on the record in the position which the State of
South Dakota here occupies.
Looking at the question from a yet narrower point of view,
the same conclusion seems to me to be impelled. In United

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
192 U. S.

WHmTE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, McKENA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

States v. Buford, (1830) 3 Pet. 11, the question was considered
whether a claim acquired by the government of the United
States from an individual, which was barred by limitation
at the time of its acquisition by the United States, was yet
enforceable in the hands of the government. The court decided that, as against the United States, under such circumstances, despite the general exemption of the government from
the operation of such statute, the bar of the statute was operative. The court said (p. 30) :
"It can require no argument to show, that the transfer of
any claim to the United States cannot give to it any greater
validity than it possessed in the hands of the assignor."
And this principle was applied by the Court of Exchequer
in .King v. .osrall, 6 Price, 24, cited approvingly in United
States v. .Tashville &e. R. Co., 118 U. S. 120. The facts of
the case were, in brief, as follows: On a scire facias it was
sought by the crown to recover from a creditor of a debtor
to the crown the amount of a certain bill of exchange. On
demurrer to a plea of the statute of limitations it was contended that the right of the crown was not barred by the statute-by a plea which in point of fact admitted the debt. The
court held otherwise. Lord Chief Baron Richards observed

(p. 28):
"The crown is only entitled to its debtor's right, and cannot
create or revive any right in the person of its debtor, if none
ever existed, or it has become extinct. In this case, nothing
could have been recovered by the debtor of the crown against
this defendant if the statute had been pleaded; I therefore
consider that it is also a good bar to the suit of the crown,
who stands precisely in the same situation as its debtor, and
that this is an honest plea which therefore the law allows.
If the crown could thus put its debtor in a better situation
than he was in before, by such a proceeding as this, the consequence would be monstrous before the passing of the late statute, and the mischief would have been incalculable."
Wood, Baron, said (p. 29):
"In this case, the claim of the 'crown is only a derivative
right, and it must, therefore, stand in the same situation as its
principal."

Garrow, Baron, remarked (p. 31):
"By a process, said, by a fiction, to be for the benefit of the
crown, it is attempted to revive the debt, and place the creditor in a better situation than the law permits. This is too
"
gross an absurdity;
These authorities additionally demonstrate that a claim
which, when acquired by the State of South Dakota, was
without legal sanction, did not by the mere fact of such acquisition become a justiciable, enforceable right. It may be
said that there was no statute of limitations in the State of
North Carolina barring the claim. But this begs the whole
question. It assumes that the State of North Carolina should
have indulged in the idle ceremony of passing a special statute
of limitations extinguishing, after the lapse of a certain time,
a cause of action which had never existed. The proposition is
but a further illustration of the misconception which results
from holding that the claim of an individual against a State
which is not enforceable can be made such by the voluntary
act of transferring. The very attribute of sovereignty renders
it unnecessary for the sovereign to legislate for its own behalf
in the passage of statutes of limitations, insolvent and other
like laws, as its will, controlled alone by the duty and sense
of responsibility which sovereignty must be presumed to engender, determines the question of liability.
But let me analyze the proposition in order to see what it
leads to. What is a statute of limitations? It is but the action of the State in determining that, after the lapse of a specified time, a claim shall not be legally enforceable. In this
case, from the very inception of the alleged obligation to the
time of the transfer to the State of South Dakota, there was
no legal cause of action for the enforcement of the claim under the laws of North Carolina, and by the obligation of the
Eleventh Amendment no cause of action on the subject could
be asserted to exist in any court of the United States. To
hold that there is a right to recover in this case which would
not exist if there had been a statute of limitations barring the
cause of action, although none had ever arisen, is but to say
that the right of the parties is to be determined by words hay-

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLLNA.

WHITE, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, McKENNA, DAY,

JJ., dissenting.

ing no significance whatever. The fact that the state of
North Carolina, in her own courts, was not subject to be coerced as to the claim in question, was in effect a state statute
of limitations, since the act of the State in forbidding the arising
of a cause of action is certainly in reason the equivalent of an
act of that State barring a cause of action in a case where one
could exist. It is the non-existence of the cause of action at
the time of the transfer, upon which rests the rule preventing
a sovereign from recovering on a claim which was barred at
the time it acquired it. This is true also of the Eleventh
Amendment. As that amendmentfrom the date of the inception of the alleged contract prohibited the assertion of any
cause of action concerning the same in the courts of the United
States, the amendment was substantially a national statute of
limitations. Thus operating, it furnishes an effectual barrier,
preventing the State of South Dakota from asserting in the
courts of the United States that it had acquired from its transferrer a cause of action which the Constitution of the United
States prevented from ever existing so far as the judicial power
of the United States was concerned.
- Nor does the fact that the State of South Dakota alleges
there was a pledge or mortgage of certain stock in the North
Carolina Railroad serve at all to take the case out of the control
of the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment. It is not
pretended that any delivery of stock alleged to have been
pledged was ever made to the bondholders; on the contrary,
it is conceded that the stock in question has always been in
the possession of the State of North Carolina. The right to
enforce the alleged pledge must therefore rest upon the power
to enforce a private claim against the State of North Carolina
and to take from its possession property of which it has ever
had the absolute dominion and control. And this view is to
my mind concluded by the previous rfilings of this court, one
of which I shall now particularly notice.
C1iristian v. Atlantic & Nforth Car'olina Rail'oad, (1890)
133 U. S. 233, was a bill in equity to reach dividends on the
stock of the railroad company, and apply such dividends to

192 U. S

and for a sale of stock owned and held by the State. It was
contended by the defendants that the proceeding was in substance against the State, and therefore within the prohibitions
of the Eleventh Amendment. The correctness of this contention was denied, on the ground that there wasavalid contract
in favor of the complainant; that by that contract there was
a pledge in its favor; and that the object of the suit was not
to hold the State of North Carolina or to sue it, but to proceed
in rem against the stock to enforce the right in and to it resulting from the contract. The court-not at all disputing
that if the premise was correct the legal conclusion based on it
was well founded-proceeded to test the accuracy of the premise. It found that the stock in question had never been
actually delivered to the alleged pledgee, but had always remained in the possession of the agents of the State. Reaching
this conclusion, it was held that there was no pledge unless
such contract resulted from the declaration of the State that
the stock held by it was pledged. Coming to consider that
question, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley,
said (p. 242):
"It was no more of a pledge than is made by a farmer when
he pledges his growing crop or his stock of cattle for the payment of a debt, without any delivery thereof. Hle does not
use the word in its technical, but in its popular sense. His
language may amount to a parol mortgage, if such a mortgage
can be created; but that is all. So in this case, the pledge
given by the State in a statute may have amounted to a mortgage, but it could amount to nothing more ; and if a mortgage,
it did not place the mortgagee in possession, but gave him
merely a naked right to have the property appropriated and
applied to the payment of his debt. But how is that right to
be asserted . If the mortgagor be a private person, the mortgagee may cite him into court and have a decree for the foreclosure and sale of the property. The mortgagor, or his
assignee, would be a necessary party in such a proceeding.
Even when absent, beyond the reach of process, he must still
be made a party and at least constructively cited by publication
or otherwise. This is established by the authorities before

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NOIRTH CAROLINA.

JUSTICE, MCKENNA, DAY, JJ.,

dissenting.

referred to, and many more might be cited to the same effect.
The proceeding is a suit against the party to obtain, by decree
of court, the benefit of the mortgage right. But where the
mortgagor in possession is a sovereign State, no such proceeding can be maintained. The mortgagee's right against
the State may be just as good and valid, in a moral point of
view, as if it were against an individual. But the State cannot
be brought into court or sued by a private party without its
consent. It was at first held by this court that, under the
Constitution of the United States, a State might be sued in it
by a citizen of another State, or of a foreign State ; but it was
declared by the 11th Amendment that the judicial power of
the United States shall not be construed to extend to such
suits. N ew Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U. S. '76; Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711 ; Parsons v. Marye, 114 U. S.
325; H agood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52; hi re Ayers, 123
U. S. 443."'
Applying the ruling made in the case just cited to the case
in hand, it to me clearly results that as possession of the alleged
pledged or mortgaged stock was never parted with by the
State of North Carolina, the right asserted by the State of
South Dakota to enforce the alleged pledge comes directly
within the prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment, since in
its essence it depends upon the existence in this court of the
power to enforce against the State of North Carolina in favor
of the State of South Dakota, a mere promise made by North
Carolina to a private individual, as to which the State of South
Dakota acquired no greater right than was possessed by the
individual who made the transfer to it of the bonds in question.
Third. Finally, putting out of view the various considerations which I have previously stated, in my opinion this record
discloses a condition of things which ought to prevent a court
of equity from exerting its powers to enforce for the benefit
of the State of South Dakota the claim which it asserts against
the State of North Carolina. From the facts which I have at
the outset recited it is undeniable that at the time the gift was
made to the State of South Dakota of the bonds in question

OCTOBER TERI,

1903.

WHiTE, J., The CmF JUSTICE, McKENNA, DAY., JJ., dissenting. 192 U. S.

they were past due and payment thereof had been more
than twenty years prior to the gift refused by the State of
North Carolina. The letter evidencing the gift demonstrates
that the purpose of the gift to the State of South Dakota,
was to enable that State to assert a cause of action against
the State of North Carolina which did not exist in favor of
the transferrer. It also appears by the act of the legislature
of South Dakota, under which this suit was brought, that
the State of South Dakota deemed that it might acquire a
mere right to litigate, since the act itself in advance provided
that the attorney general of the State should prosecute actions in the name of the State to recover on bonds or choses
in action which might be transferred to the State, and that it
contemplated litigation without cost to itself, since the act
empowered the attorney general to employ counsel to prosecute
suits, the compensation to be paid out ofthe jrocees which might
be realized. This condition of things, in my opinion, although
it may not be champertous in the strict sense of that word
is in its nature equivalent to a champertous engagement,
whose enforcement is contrary to public policy, and one which
a court therefore ought not to lend its aid to carry into effect.
It has been sometimes said that the doctrine of maintenance
and champerty has no application to the sovereign. But this
can alone be justified by taking into view the high attributes
which pertain to sovereignty. Now if the State of South
Dakota may avail of the delegation of judicial power over
controversies between States-a power conferred in view of
the sovereign dignity of all the States-for the purpose of destroying the sovereignty of another State by subjecting such
State to judicial coercion concerning a claim of a private individual, then it seems to me the State of South Dakota should
be treated as any other private individual seeking to enforce a
private claim, and should have applied to it by a court of
equity the principles of morality and justice which control
such courts in refusing aid to persons who acquire merely
litigious and speculative claims. As said by this court, in the
course of its opinion in 1?andolph vs. Quidnick Co., (1890) 135
U. S.457: "It is a case where equity, true to its ideas of sub-

SOUTH DAKOTA v. NORTH CAROLINA.
192 U. S.

WHm, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, McXENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting.

stantial justice, refuses to be bound by the letter of legal procedure, or to lend its aid to a mere speculative purchase
which threatens injury and ruin to a large body of honest
creditors, who have trusted for the payment of their debts
to the legal validity of proceedings theretofore taken." How
aptly these observations apply to the case in hand is shown
when it is considered that the holders of more than two million dollars of bonds of the same class as that held by the
State of South Dakota, more than twenty years before the
transfer to that State, accepted, on the faith of the operation of the Eleventh Amendment, and the circumstances
surrounding the State of North Carolina at the time, the
adjustment proposed by the act of 1879 ; and therefore that
the claim of South Dakota now urged, in effect, as I have
previously stated, seeks to avail of the result brought about
by the operation of the Eleventh Amendment, and yet at the
same time to deny its efficacy as regards the rights which it
claims. It is additionally shown by the inference arising
from the record that the whole fiscal system of the State of
North Carolina in existence since the adjustment of 1879 has
rested upon the action taken by the creditors of the State consequent upon their reliance upon the possession by the State of
the attributes of sovereignty which it was the purpose of the
Eleventh Amendment to consecrate.
But eliminating all the previous reasoning and considering
the case upon the hypothesis that the controversy is one between States, nevertheless I am of opinion that the court is
without jurisdiction. And the statement of the reasons which
impel me to this conclusion involves an examination of the second proposition which was by me at the outset stated,
that is-

(B.)
The want ofpower to render the decree which is now directed to
be entered, because of the absence of essentialparties whose
presence would oust jurisdietionand the impotency to grant
any relief whatever in the absence of such parties.
Even under the view that the general conclusions of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
WH E, J., The CHIEF JUSTICE, TNCIKENNA, DAY, JJ., dissenting. 192 U. S.

court as to its authority over the controversy as one between
States is well founded, I cannot agree that the holders of the
bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad are not
essential parties to this controversy, since the nature of the
relief specifically prayed necessitates their presence, and since,
without such presence, in my opinion, no decree giving substantial relief to the complainant or doing justice to the principal defendant, can be rendered. If they are such essential
parties, it is not questioned that the court is without jurisdiction. California v. Soutern Pacific Company, 157 U. S.
229.
Under the assumption that there was a valid mortgage in
favor of the complainant and other holders of the same class
of bonds, the bill proceeds upon the theory that it is essential
that it be determined what claim or right the holders of the
bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad have upon
or in the stock in question. To that end the bill challenged the
existence of any right of pledge in favor of such bondholders,
upon the theory that, as against the holders of bonds issued in
aid of the Western North Carolina Railroad, they had lost
their right by accepting the compromise of 1879. It is, however, further asserted in the bill that even if the holders of
the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad had
not, by accepting the compromise of 1879, lost their rights as
to the complainant and those similarly situated, yet as the
pledge was past due when the adjustment of 1879 was entered
into, it was essential, to afford the complainant relief as a
junior secured creditor on the stock, that the entire stock be
sold free from all encumbrances. And this was also the position taken by the answer filed on behalf of the representative
of the outstanding bonds issued in aid of the Western North
Carolina Railroad. The bill, then, having been framed upon
the theory of the necessity of the specific relief referred to,
which could not be afforded without the presence of the
other lienholders, the cause, it seems to me, ought not now to
be decided upon a wholly different theory, and relief, inconsistent with that specifically prayed for, be awarded to
the complainant upon that changed basis.

But, leaving out of view the considerations.
just stated,
it seems to me the decree which it is proposed to enter
cannot afford any specific relief to the complainant, without
destroying or materially impairing the rights of the prior
lienholders, although they are now held not to be essential parties to the controversy. The pledge in favor of the
holders of the bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad was of all the stock and for the benefit of all the bonds. It
was therefore indivisible. It cannot be divided without impairing the obligations of the contract in favor of those creditors. Now, whilst each of the ten mortgages which it is in
effect held the complainant possesses purported to be of ten
shares of stock securing each bond, no particular ten shares
were delivered, segregated or identified. As a result no division of the stock held by the State had in fact ever been made,
and, therefore, each and every one of the ten shares assumed
to be mortgaged to secure each of, the bonds were subject to
the prior lien on all the stock in favor of all the holders of
bonds issued in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. When
the attempt is made to enforce the decree in this case what
shares will be sold? If any particular shares, then, unless
the rights of the prior lienholders are to be rendered divisible,
although they are indivisible, the shares sold must continue to
be subject to the entire pledge in favor of all the bonds issued
in aid of the North Carolina Railroad. To state this situation,
it seems to me, is to demonstrate that the decree will afford
no substantial relief whatever. The best that can be said,
under such circumstances, is that the effect of a sale so made
will be merely to foment a law suit. A court of equity,
when its aid is invoked to give particular relief, if it finds
that it is unable to do it, ought not, whilst denying such
relief, to enter a decree which confers no substantial relief,
but, on the contrary, can only serve as a fruitful source of
futurelitigation, injurious to the rights of the veryparty or class
of persons in whose favor the decree is rendered. But this is
not all, for whilst the decree will, in substance, deprive the
complainant of any real benefit from his assumed security, a
sale under the decree must also result injuriously to the State

of North Carolina. Its rights, as well as those of the complainant, are entitled to consideration. The possibility of a
deficiency decree is now taken into account in the opinion and
rights on that subject are reserved. But if the sale which is
to be ordered is one which must lead to a prejudicial result,
then the effect of the decree is simply to order a sale which
can produce at best no more than a nominal sum, and will lay
a foundation for a deficiency decree for an amount wholly
out of proportion to the actual value of the mortgaged property. It is to my mind no answer to point out that whilst
there was no segregation and delivery of the ten shares of
stock mortgaged to secure each bond, as such division was
provided for, a court of equity will treat that as being done which
should have been done. The fallacy of this lies in failing to
consider the rights of the prior lienholders and overlooking
the fact that their lien was indivisible, and that the segregation provided for in the act of 1866 could not be made
without being subordinate to the entire sum of the prior and
indivisible right of pledge. When this is borne in mind it
results that the rights of those prior lienholders are necessarily clouded or impaired by decreeing that a court of equity
will treat that as having been done which ought to have
been done; when the very question is, could it have been
done efficaciously, consistently with the rights of the prior
lienholders? They are, therefore, I submit, essential parties,
if it is proposed to give any real relief by the decree of sale
which is ordered. If it is not proposed to give that character of relief, then such a decree ought not to be entered,
especially when it does not accord with and in reality is inconsistent with the specific relief asked for.
I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JusTICE, MR. JusTICE McIKENNA and MR. JUSTICE DAY

concur in this dissent.
