WEDDING v. MEYIER.
ERROR TO THE 'WARREN CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE

STATE OF

KEWEUCKY.
No. 125.

Argued January 14,15, 1904.-Decided February 23,1904.

Under the statute passed in 1789 by Virginia, known as the "Virginia
Compact," and the act of Congress of February 4, 1791, c. 4, 1 Stat. 189,
making Kentucky a State, the State of Indiana has concurrent jurisdiction,
including the right to serve process, with Kentucky on the Ohio River
opposite its shores below low water mark. An Indiana judgment dependent for its validity upon a summons served on that part of the river
is entitled to full faith and credit when sued upon in another State. The
effect of the above mentioned acts in giving jurisdiction to Indiana is a
Federal question.
Where a decision by the state court of the Federal question appears to have
been the foundation of the judgment a writ of error lies.
The writ of error runs to a lower court when the record remains there, and
the judgment has to be entered there after a decision of the question of
law involved by the highest court of the State.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

As to the Federal question.
The first four assignments of error state a Federal question
arising under the first clause of section 709, Rev. Stat.
The fifth, one arising under the third clause; and the sixth,
one arising under the second clause.
As to assignments under the first and second clauses, it is
sufficient that it appear that the validity of the statute was
drawn in question and it is not necessary that any right be
"specially set apart or claimed." Columbia IWaterPower Co.

If the language of the compact were doubtful, the fact that
Indiana and Ohio had, from the very beginning, exercised
the same jurisdiction over the Ohio as Kentucky and Virginia
and that the jurisdiction thus exercised was acquiesced in and
conceded by Kentucky and Virginia would of itself, under the
rule of contemporaneous construction recognized by this court,
be sufficient to put the question at rest.

The executive, legislative and judicial departments of
Indiana have not only claimed, but have actually exercised
jurisdiction of every kind over the Ohio River where it serves
as a boundary, for a hundred years. For an almost equal
length of time the States of Ohio and Illinois have done the
same thing. The States of Kentucky, Virginia and West
Virginia have not only notdisputed this exercise of authoyity,
but their courts and their legislatures have conceded that it
is rightful. Under such conditions, where the authority is of
doubtful origin, the acquiescence of Kentucky for so long a
time is, in the words of this court, "conclusive of" Indiana's
"title and rightful authority." Indianav. Kentucky, 136 U.

Me. .D. T. Sanders, for defendant in error:
Plaintiffs in error are not entitled to a writ of error from
this court to the Warren Circuit Court of the State of Kentucky, to review the judgment rendered in that court, dismissing the suit of the plaintiffs in error.
The rule in Kentucky is, that although a case has been decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, upon its return to
the trial court it is competent to amend the pleadings and set
up a wholly different cause of action, and to transfer it under
the amendment from an action at law to a suit in equity, notwithstanding the decision and the mandate of the Court of
Appeals. Ilillerich & Son v. Franklin Ins. Co., 23 Ky. L. R.

The State of Indiana has not concurrent jurisdiction with
Kentucky over the Ohio River. As to the Virginia cession,
see Wallace v. Parker,6 Pet. 313.
Without further elaboration of the historical features of this
cession of the territory of the northwest to the general government, reference is made to the Constitutional History of

The state courts of Iowa have no power to remove a nuisance beyond the center of the Mississippi River, which consists of a permanent dam of the river on the Illinois side.

Such permanent objects are taxable only in the State in
which they are situated, and when the object is a bridge, the

are there taxable. State v. .etz, 5 Dutch. 122; Henderson

MR.

JUSTICE

HOLmES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to a Circuit Court of the State of Kentucky on a judgment entered there in pursuance of a mandate
of the Court of Appeals of that State. 107 Kentucky, 310, 685.
The action was brought upon an Indiana judgment. The answer denied the jurisdiction of the Indiana court. It was not
disputed that the service in that suit was on a steamboat in the
Ohio River on the Indiana side. At the trial two questions were
left to the jury, one whether the person ptirporting to act as the
attorney of the defendant in the Indiana suit was authorized to
represent him, and the other whether the summons in that suit
was served on the Indiana or Kentucky side of the low-water
mark of the Ohio River where it touches the Indiana shore. The
jury found against the authority of the alleged attorney, and
found that the service was on the Kentucky side of the lowwater mark, and therefore, it is assumed, within the boundaries
of Kentucky. Thereupon the plaintiffs in error (the original
plaintiffs) moved for judgment notwithstanding the findings

WEDDING v. MEYLER.
192 U. S..

Opinion of the Court.

of the jury, and judgment was ordered. The defendant excepted and appealed. The Court of Appeals sustained the
exceptions and ordered a judgment on the verdict dismissing
the action. A judgment was entered, as ordered, in the court
below, the above mentioned Circuit Court, and this writ of
error was brought.
It is suggested that the writ of error should have been directed to the Court of Appeals. But it appears from the form
of the order of that court that the record remained in the lower
court where judgment was ordered to be entered, and the writ
properly ran to the court where the judgment had to be rendered. Rothschild v. Knight, 184: U. S. 334. It is suggested
further, that the record does not show a Federal question.
But the jurisdiction of the Indiana court was put in issue by
the pleadings and it is apparent from what has been said that
the decision went on a denial of that jurisdiction because of the
place of service. That denial could be justified only on the
ground that the compact of Virginia and the act of Congress
of February 4, 1791, admitting Kentucky to the Union, did
not confer the right of jurisdiction which the Indiana court
attempted to exercise and which the State of Indiana claims.
The judgment and the opinion of the Court of Appeals both
disclose that the decision was against the right under the
statutes referred to, and that it was on that ground only that
the Indiana judgment was denied any force or effect. The
question as to the right of jurisdiction sufficiently appears.
San Josi Land & Water Co. v San osj Ranch Co., 189 U. S.
177, 180. It is not denied that that question is one which can
be taken to this court. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 13 How. 518, 566.
We pass to the question decided by the Court of Appeals.
In 1789 the State of Virginia passed a statute known as the
Virginia Compact. This statute proposed the erection of the
district of Kentucky into an independent State upon certain
conditions. -One of these was: § 11. "Seventh, that the
use and navigation of the river Ohio, so far as the territory
of the proposed state, or the territory which shall remain
within the limits of this commonwealth lies thereon, shall be

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

free and common to the citizens of the United States, and the
respective jurisdictions of this Commonwealth and of the proposed state on the river as aforesaid, shall be concurrent only
with the states which may possess the opposite shores of the
said river." 13 Hening, St. at L. 17. (The 'previous cession
by Virginia of its rights in the territory northwest of the Ohio
had been on condition that the territory so ceded should be
laid out and formed into States. Act of December 20, 1783,
11 Hening, St. at L. 326.) The act of Congress of February 4,
1791, c. 4, 1 Stat. 189, consents and enacts that the "district
of Kentucky, within the jurisdiction of the said commonwealth" of Virginia, shall be formed into a new State and
admitted into the Union. As a preliminary it recites the consent of the Virginia legislature by the above act of 1789.
Under article 4, section 3, of the Constitution, a new State
could not be formed in this way within the jurisdiction of
Virginia., within which Kentucky was recognized as being by
the words last quoted, without the consent of the legislature
of Virginia as well as of Congress. The need of such consent
also was recognized by the recital in the act of Congress.
But as the consent given by Virginia was conditioned upon
the jurisdiction of Kentucky on the Ohio river being concurrent only with the States to be formed on the other side,
Congress necessarily assented to and adopted this condition
when it assented to the act in which it was contained. Green
v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 87. Thus, after the passage of the two
acts, it stood absolutely enacted by the powers which between
them had absolute sovereignty over all the territory concerned
that when States should be formed on the opposite shores of
the river they should have concurrent jurisdiction on the river
with Kentucky. "This compact, by the sanction of Congress,
has become a law of the Union. What further legislation can
be desired for judicial action ? " Pennsylvaniav. Wheeling &
Belmont Bridge Co., 13 How. 518, 566.
It hardly is necessary to be curious or technical; when dealing with law-making power, in inquiring precisely what legal
conceptions shall be invoked in order to bring to pass what
the legislature enacts. If the law-making power says that a

WEDDING v. MEYLER.

Opinion of the Court.

matter within its competence shall be so, so it will be, so far as
legal theory is concerned, without regard to the eleganti juis,
or whether it fits that theory or not. But there is no trouble
in giving the subsequently formed States the benefit of this
legislation. In the case of Kentucky the "compact" which
the Virginia statute has been treated by this court as creating,
Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 16, 90, 92, may be regarded as
having been in the first stage not only a law but a continuing
offer to the expected new State when it should come into being,
which was accepted by that State when it came into being on
the terms prescribed. And so as to the new States to be formed
thereafter on the other side of the river. It is true that they
were strangers to the most immediate purposes of the transaction. But it must be remembered that this was legislation,
and when it is enacted by the sovereign power that new States,
when formed by that power, shall have a certain jurisdiction,
those States as they come into existence fall within the range
of the enactment and have the jurisdiction. Whether they
be said to have it by way of acceptance of an offer, or on the
theory of a trust for them, or on the ground that jurisdiction
was attached to the land subject to the condition that States
should be formed, or by simple legislative fiat, is not a material question, so far as this case is concerned. With that legislation in force there was no need to refer to it or to regnact
it in the act which made Indiana a State. That the States
opposite to Kentucky have the jurisdiction, whatever it is,
over the Ohio River, which the Virginia compact provided
for, was not disputed by the majority of the Kentucky Court
of Appeals, and has been recognized by this court and elsewhere whenever the question has come up. Henderson Bridge

192 U. S.

Virginia Compact. It was suggested by one of the judges
below that the words "the respective jurisdictions
shall be concurrent only with the States which may possess
the opposite shore" did not import a future grant but only a
restriction; that they excluded the United States or other
States, but left the jurisdiction of the States on the two sides
to be determined by boundary, and therefore that the jurisdiction of Kentucky was exclusive up to its boundary line of
low-water mark on the Indiana side. This interpretation
seems to be without sufficient warrant to require discussion.
A different one has been assumed hitherto and is required by
an accurate reading. The several jurisdictions of two States
respectively over adjoining portions of a river separated by a
boundary line is no more concurrent than is a similar jurisdiction over adjoining counties or strips of land. Concurrent
jurisdiction, properly so-called, on rivers is familar to our
legislation, and means the jurisdiction of two powers over one
and the same place. There is no reason to give an unusual
meaning to the phrase. See Sanders v. St. Louis & New Orleans Anchor -Line,97 Missouri, 26, 30; Osahl v. Judd, 30
Minnesota, 126, 129, 130; T.S. Keator Lumber Co. v. S.
oix Boom Corp., 72 Wisconsin, 02, and the cases last cited.
The construction adopted by the majority of the Court of
Appeals seems to us at least equally untenable. It was held
that the words " meant only that the States should have legislative jurisdiction." But jurisdiction, whatever else or more it
may mean, is jurisdictio,in its popular sense of authority to apply the law to the acts of men. Vicat VFocab., sub. v. See
Rhode Islandv. Massachusetts, 12 Peters, 657, 718. What the
Virginia compact most certainly conferred on the States north
of the Ohio, was the right to administer the law below low-water
mark on the river, and, as part of that right, the right to serve
process there with effect. State v. Afullen, 35 Iowa, 199, 205,
206. What more jurisdiction, as used in the statute, may embrace, or what law or laws properly would determine the civil
or criminal effect of acts done upon the river we have no occasion to decide in this case. But so far as applicable we
adopt the statement of Chief Justice Robertson in Amnold v.

ADAMS v. NEW YORK.
192 U. S.

Syllabus.

Skields, 5 Dana, 18, 22: "Jurisdiction, unqualified, being, as

it is, the sovereign authority to make, decide on, and execute
laws, a concurrence of jurisdiction, therefore, must entitle Indiana to as much power-legislative, judiciary, and executive,
as that possessed by Kentucky, over so much of the Ohio
River as flows between them."
The conveniences and inconveniences of concurrent jurisdiction both are obvious and do not need to be stated. We have
nothing to do with them when the law-making power has
spoken. To avoid misunderstanding it may be well to add
that the concurrent jurisdiction given is jurisdiction "on" the
river, and does not extend to permanent structures attached
to the river bed and within the boundary of one or the other
State. Therefore, such cases as .AXississippi & lfXissouri Bail.oadv. Ward, 2 Black, 485, do not apply. Sate v. .ullen,
35 Iowa, 199, 206, 207.

ADAMS v. NEW YORK.
YORK.
ERROR TO THE SUP1REME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW

No. 504. Argued January 27,1904.-Decided February 23, 1904.
ilThe fact that papers, which are pertinent to the issue, may have been

legally taken from the possession of the party against whom they are
offered is not a valid objection to their admissibility. The court considers the competency of the evidence and not the method by which it
was obtained.
There is no violation of the constitutional guaranty of privilege from unlawful searches and seizures in admitting as evidence in a criminal trial,
papers found in the execution of a valid search warrant prior to the indictment; and by the introduction of such evidence defendant is not compelled to incriminate himself.
It is within the established power of a State to prescribe the evidence which
is to be received in its own courts. The provisions of sections 344a, and
344b, of the Penal Code of New York making the possession of policy
slips by a person other than a public officer presumption of possession
