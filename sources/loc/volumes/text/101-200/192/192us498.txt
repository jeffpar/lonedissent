of time fixed by the statute, which was ample in duration.
He was notified of the happening of the various contingencies
requiring positive action on his part. The duty to take such
action was enjoined upon him, and if he failed to exercise it
the collector was under the obligation after the expiration of
the time imit to destroy the goods. That plaintiff in error
had knowledge of the various steps taken with respect to the
tea, including the final rejection by the board of general appraisers, is conceded. We think the provision of the statute
complained of was not wanting in due process of law.

DECIDED

on authority of Buttfield v. Stranahan,ante, p. 470.

Mr. James L. Bishop, with whom Mr. James H. Simpson
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error.

Mr. Edward B. Whitney, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Hoyt was on the

This action was brought by Buttfield to recover damages

sustained by being prevented from importing into the United
States a large number of packages of Country green teas, being

four shipments from China. These teas, on reexamination by
the board of general appraisers, were found to be inferior in
quality to the standard prescribed by law; and Bidwell, as
collector for the port of New York, so notified Buttfield.
Thereupon the teas were withdrawn from the bonded warehouse and exported. Judgment was entered for Bidwell upon
a directed verdict in his favor. The right to reversal of that
judgment is predicated solely upon the asserted unconstitutionality of the tea inspection act of March 2, 1897. It will not be
necessary to determine whether, even supposing the statute
to be unconstitutional, a cause of action is stated in any of the
four counts of the complaint below. The statute having been
held to be valid in the opinion just announced in Buttfield v.
Stranahan, the judgment must be and is hereby

Affirmed.
