preparation could begin after manufacture. In the present
case, as we have seen, it is admitted that the filled cheese was
manufactured for exportation and was being prepared, immediately after manufacture, for exportation. The tax here was,
in effect, collected while the cheese was being made ready for
exportation, and therefore, to use the words of Turpin v.
Burgess, whilst it "was being exported."
For the reasons stated, I am constrained to dissent from the
opinion and judgment of the court.
I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in

this opinion.

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v. ADAMS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 143. Argued January 25, 26, 1904.-Decided February 23, 1904.

When a railroad company gives gratuitously, and a passenger accepts, a
pass, the former waives its rights as a common carrier to exact compensation; and, if the pass contains a condition to that effect, the latter assumes
the risks of ordinary negligence of the company's employes; the arrangement is one which the parties may make and no public policy is violated
thereby. And if the passenger is injured or killed while riding on such a
pass gratuitously given, which he has accepted with knowledge of the
conditions therein, the company is not liable therefor either to him or to
his heirs, in the absence of wilful or wanton negligence.
A railroad company is not under two measures of liability-one to the passenger and the other to his heirs. The latter claim under him and can recover only in case he could have recovered had he been injured only
and not killed.

A statute of Idaho reads as follows:
"When the death of a person, not being a minor, is caused

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. ADAMS.

Statement of the Case.

by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his heirs or personal
representatives may maintain an action for damages against
the person causing the death; or if such person be employed
by another person who is responsible for his conduct, then also
against such other person. In every action under this and
the preceding section, such damages may be given as under
all the circumstances of the case may be just." Revised Statutes of Idaho, §4100.
Jay H. Adams resided in Spokane, Washington. He was a
lawyer and the attorney of several railway companies, though
not in the employ of petitioner. He was a frequent traveler
on petitibner's and other railways. On November 13,.1898,
he with a friend started on one of petitioner's trains from Hope,
Idaho, to Spokane. The train consisted of an engine and eight
cars, those behind the express car being in the following order:
smoking car, day coach, tourist sleeper, dining car, Pullman
sleeper. All were vestibuled except the tourist sleeper immediately in front of the dining car. It had open platforms, as
an ordinary passenger coach. Shortly after leaving Hope,
Mr. Adams, then in the smoking car, went back to the dining
car for cigars. To reach the dining car he passed through the
day coach and the tourist sleeper. After buying cigars he left
the dining car and went forward. This was the last seen of
him alive. His body was found the next day opposite a curve
in the railroad track about.six miles west of Hope. There
was no direct testimony as to how he got off the train, whether
by an accidental stumble, or by being thrown therefrom through
the lurching of the train which was going at a high rate of speed.
The road from Hope to the place where the body was found is
in Idaho. He was riding on a free pass, containing these provisions:
"CONDITIONS.

"This free ticket is not transferable, and, if presented by
another person than the individual named thereon, or if any
alteration, addition or erasure is made upon it, it is forfeited,
and the conductor will take it up and collect full fare.

Argument for Petitioner.

"The person accepting this free ticket agrees that the
Northern Pacific Railway Company shall not be liable, under
any circumstances, whether of negligence of agents or otherwise, for any injury to the person, or for any loss or damage
to the property, of the passenger using the same.
"I accept the above conditions.
" JAY

ADAMS.

"This pass will not be honored unless signed in ink by the
person for whom issued."
This action was brought by the plaintiffs, the widow and son
of the deceased, in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Washington. Verdict and judgment were in
their favor for $14,000, which were sustained by the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 54 C. C. A. 196; 116 Fed. Rep.
324, and thereupon the case was brought here on a writ of
certiorari. 187 U. S. 643.
Mr. Charles W. Bunn for petitioner:
The verdict as to negligence rests on the most flimsy foundation, and the want of vestibules on the platforms of the tourist
sleeping car was improperly submitted to the jury as a ground
of liability. Sansom v. Southern Railway, 50 C. C. A. 53.
There was no sufficient evidence that the real cause of death
was either the lurching of the train or the want of a vestibule.
The jury were told they should presume Mr. Adams was
crossing the platform with due care; and they were also allowed to presume that a lurch of the train threw him off. The
verdict therefore rests not only on presumption, but on two presumptions, which in point of fact are not consistent with each
other. Reidhead v. Skagil County, 73 Pac. Rep. 118; Wills
on Circumstantial Evidence, 274; Asbach v. Railway Co., 74

negligence and unskillfulness of the defendant, is not sufficient. Searles v. Railway Co., 101 N. Y. 661, affirmed in
Grant v. Railway Co., 133 N. Y. 659.
Where the evidence is equally consistent with either viewthe existence or non-existence of negligence-it is not competent for the judge to leave the matter to the jury. The party
who affirms negligence has failed to establish it. This is a
rule which never ought to be lost sight of. Cotton v. Wood, 8

Mr. Reese H. Voorhees, with whom Mr. C. S. Voorhees was
on the brief, for defendants in error:
The contract on the back of the transportation alleged to
have been used by the deceased at the time of his death, which
purports to release the petitioner from all liability for injury
to the person of the deceased, caused by the negligence of the
petitioner, is void as against the plaintiffs, because they
were not parties to such contract, and over their right of action

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. ADAMS.

445

Argument for Defendants in Error.

for loss to them, deceased could exercise no control, because
the contract does not exempt the carrier from liability for
death, and because the contract is void as against public policy.
Plaintiffs have an independent right of action for the losses
to them occasioned by petitioner's negligence, which right of
action the deceased could neither enjoy nor in any wise control.
The negligence of the petitioner, and the death of deceased
occurred in Idaho. See Rev. Stat. Idaho, § 4100. As to
right to maintain action under similar statute, see § 4828, Ballinger's Ann. Code and Stat. Washington.
These two statutes are for the exclusive benefit of the heirs,
and are not for the benefit of the estate of the deceased. Munro
v. Dredging, etc., Co., 84 California, 515; Noble v. Seattle, 19
Washington, 133.
Lord Campbell's act, and the many acts inspired by it
create and grant to other persons than the deceased or his
estate, an independent right to recover for the losses sustained
by such other persons through the negligence of a party causing death, such right of action being separate and distinct from
any right of action which the deceased had, or could have
enjoyed had he survived. Blake v. Midland Ry. Co., 18 Q. B.

after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JusTIcE BREw R,

As the negligence of the company, found by the jury to have

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. ADAMS.
192 U. S.

449

Opinion of the Court.

caused the death, as well as the resulting death took place in
Idaho, the plaintiffs' right of action rests on the statute of that
State. What is the scope and meaning of that statute? The
Circuit Court charged the jury:
"You are not to consider what was the duty of this carier
toward Mr. Adams who was killed, but the duty which the
defendant owed to these plaintiffs; and the duty which they
have the right to exact from the defendant in this case is the
same duty which the defendant company owed to the public
in general."
In other words, although it should appear that the company
in no respect failed in its duty to the deceased, it could yet be
held responsible to the widow and son for the damages they
suffered by reason of the death. But this is a misconception.
Their right of action arises only when his death is caused by
"the wrongful act or neglect." If there be no omission of
duty to the decedent, his heirs have no claim. Suppose an
individual is wantonly assailed and in order to protect his own
life is obliged to kill the assailant, may the heirs of the decedent have that act of taking life, rightful as against the decedent, adjudged wrongful as against them, and recover damages
fron one who did only that which his duty to himself and
family required him to do? The statute does not provide that
when one's life is taken by another the heirs of the former may
recover damages, but only when it is wrongfully taken, that is,
when it is taken in violation of the rights of the decedent,
wrongful as against him. "Neglect" stands in the same category with "wrongful act." It implies some omission of duty.
The trial court in this case charged the jury:
"Negligence to create a liability on the part of parties
in fault must be a failure to observe the degree of care and
prudence that is demanded in the discharge of the duty
which the person charged with the negligence owed under
the peculiar circumstances of the case to the injured
party."
As stated in Pollock on Torts, p. 355, quoting from Baron
voL. cxcii-29

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

Alderson in Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Company, 11 Ex.
784; 25 L. J. Ex. 213:
" 'Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing
something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do,'
provided, of course, that the party whose conduct is in question
is already in a situation that brings him under the duty of
taking care."
The two terms, therefore, wrongful act and neglect, imply
alike the omission of some duty, and that duty must, as stated,
be a duty owing to the decedent. It cannot be that, if the
death was caused by a rightful act, or an unintentional act
with no omission of duty owing to the decedent, it can be considered wrongful or negligent at the suit of the heirs of the
decedent. They claim under him, and they can recover only
in case he could have recovered damages had he not been killed,
but only injured. The company is not under two different
measures of obligation-one to the passenger and another to
his heirs. If it discharges its full obligation to the passenger,
his heirs have no right to compel it to pay damages.
Did the company omit any duty which it owed to the
decedent? He was riding on a pass which provided that the
company should "not be liable, under any circumstances,
whether of negligence of agents of otherwise, for any injury
to the person." He was a free passenger, paying nothing for
the privilege given him of riding in the coaches of the defendant. He entered those coaches as a licensee, upon conditions
which he, with full knowledge, accepted. He was not a passenger for hire, such as was held to be the condition of the
parties recovering in Railroad Company v. Lockwood, 17 Wall.
357, and Railway Company v. Stevens, 95 U. S.655. In the
first of these cases Mr. Justice Bradley, who delivered the
opinion of the court, closed an elaborate discussion of the
questions with these words:
"We purposely abstain from expressing any opinion as to

NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. AD-MS. 451
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

what would have been the result of our judgment had we considered the plaintiff a free passenger instead of a passenger for
hire."
The question then is distinctly presented whether a railroad
company is liable in damages to a person injured, through the
negligence of its employ~s, who at the time is riding on a pass
given as a gratuity, and upon the condition known to and
accepted by him that it shall not be responsible for such injuries. It will be perceived that the question excludes injuries
resulting from wilful or wanton acts, but applies only to cases
of ordinary negligence. The facts of this case certainly do
not call for any broader inquiry than this. The specific matters
of negligence charged are the placing a non-vestibuled car in
a vestibuled train, and the high rate of speed at which the
train passed around the curve at the place of injury. But
non-vestibuled cars are in constant use all over the countrywere the only cars in use up to a few years ago-and further,
the deceased, having passed over the open platform, knew
exactly its condition. As the court charged the jury, "Mr.
Adams must be presumed to have known that it was not
vestibuled and to have acted with perfect knowledge of the
fact." The rate of speed was no greater than is common on
other trains everywhere in the land, and the train was, in fact,
run safely on this occasion. We shall assume, however, but
without deciding, that the jury were warranted, considering
the absence of the vestibuled platform and the high rate of
speed in coming around the curve, in finding the company
guilty of negligence; but clearly it was not acting either wilfully or wantonly in running its trains at this not uncommon
rate of speed, and all that can at most be said is that there was
ordinary negligence. Is the company responsible for injuries
resulting from ordinary negligence to an individual whom it
permits to ride without charge on condition that he take all
the risks of such negligence?
This questioh has received the consideration of many courts
and been answered in different and opposing ways. We shall

not attempt to review the cases in state courts. Among those
which hold that the company is not responsible may be mentioned Rogers v. Kennebec &c. Company, 86 Maine, 261; Quimby
v. Boston &c. Railroad Company, 150 Massachusetts, 365;
Griswold v. New York &c. Railroad Company, 53 Connecticut,
371; Kinney v. Central Railroad Company, 34 N. J. Law, 513;
Payne v. Terre Haute &c. Railway Company, 157 Indiana, 616;
Muldoon v. Seattle City Railway Company, 7 Washington, 528;
S. C., 10 Washington, 311. This last case was decided by the
Supreme Court of the State, in which the Federal court rendering the judgment in controversy was held. The English
decisions are to the same effect. McCawley v. Furness Railway Company, L. R. 8 Q. B. 57; Hall v. Northeastern Railway
Company, L. R. 10 Q.-B. 437; Duff v. Great Northern Railroad
Company, Ir. L. R. 4 Com. Law, 178; Alexander v. Toronto &c.
Railway Company, 33 Up. Can. Q. B. 474. Among those holding that the company is responsible are: Rose v. Des Moines
Valley Railroad Company, 39 Iowa, 246, though that case is
rested partially on a state statute; Pennsylvania Railroad
Company v. Butler, 57 Pa. St. 335; Mobile & Ohio Railroad
Company v. Hopkins, 41 Alabama, 486; Gull, Colorado &c.
Railway Company v. McGowan, 65 Texas, 640.
Turning to the decisions of this court, in Philadelphia &
Reading Railroad Company v. Derby, 14 How. 468, and Steamboat New World v. King, 16 How. 469, the parties injured were
free passengers, but it does not appear that there were any
stipulations concerning the risk of negligence, and the companies were held guilty of gross negligence. In Baltimore &
Ohio &c. Railway v. Voigt, 176 U. S. 498, Voigt, an express
messenger riding in a car set apart for the use of an express
company, was injured by the negligence of the railway company. There was an agreement between the two companies
that the former would hold the railway company free from all
liability for negligence, whether caused by the negligence of
the railway company or its employ6s. Voigt entering into
the employ of the express company, signed a contract in writ-

ing, whereby he agreed to assume all the risk of accident or
injury in the course of his employment, whether occasioned by
negligence or otherwise, and expressly ratified the agreement
between the express company and the railway company. It
was held that he could not maintain an action against the railway company for injuries resulting from the negligence of its
employ6s. Mr. Justice Shiras, who delivered the opinion of
the court, reviewed many state decisions, and concluded with
these words (p. 520):
"Without enumerating and appraising all the cases respectively cited, our conclusion is that Voigt, occupying an express
car as a messenger in charge of express matter, in pursuance
of the contract between the companies, was not a passenger
within the meaning of the case of Railroad Company v. Lockwood; that he was not constrained to enter into the contract
whereby the railroad company was exonerated from liability
to him, but entered into the same freely and voluntarily, and
obtained the benefit of it by securing his appointment as such
messenger, and that such a contract did not contravene public
policy."
In the light of this decision but one answer can be made to
the question. The railway company was not as to Adams a
carrier for hire. It waived its right as a common carrier to
exact compensation. It offered him the privilege of riding
in its coaches without charge if he would assume the risks of
negligence. He was not in the power of the company and
obliged to accept its terms. They stood on an equal footing.
If he had desired to hold it to its common law obligations to
him as a passenger, he could have paid his fare and compelled
the company to receive and carry him. He freely and voluntarily chose to accept the privilege offered, and having accepted that privilege cannot repudiate the conditions. It was
not a benevolent association, but doing a railroad business for
profit; and free passengers are not so many as to induce negligence on its part. So far as the element of contract controls,
it was a contract which neither party was bound to enter into,

and yet one which each was at liberty to make, and no public
policy was violated thereby.
It follows from these considerations that there was error in
the proceedings of the Circuit Court and Court of Appeals. The
judgments of those courts will be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to set aside the
verdict and grant a new trial.

ST. CLAIR COUNTY v. INTERSTATE SAND AND CAR
TRANSFER COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 17. Argued March 19, 1903.-Decided February 23, 1904.

Conceding, arguendo, that the police power of a State extends to the establishment, regulation or licensing of ferries on navigable streams which are
boundaries between it and another State, there are no decisions of this
court importing power in a State to directly control interstate commerce
or any transportation by water across such a river which does not constitute a ferry in the strict technical sense of that term.
There is an essential distinction between a ferry in the restricted and legal
signification of the term and the transportation of railroad cars across a
boundary river between two States constituting interstate commerce, and
such transportation cannot be subjected to conditions imposed by a State
which are direct burdens upon interstate commerce.
THE facts in this case, which involved the right of the county
to recover statutory penalties for carrying on, without a ferry
license, the transportation of cars across the Mississippi River between points in Illinois and Missouri, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles W. Thomas for plaintiff in error submitted:
The authority to establish and regulate ferries between States
