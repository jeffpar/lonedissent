illegal because a direct burden upon interstate commerce, was
made a condition precedent to the doing of business of that
character.
Because we have, arguendo, rested our conclusion in this
case upon the assumption that the respective States have the
power to regulate ferries over navigable rivers constituting
boundaries between States, we must not be understood as
deciding that that doctrine, which undoubtedly finds support
in the opinions announced in Fanning v. Gregoire and Conway
v. Taylor, has not been modified by the rule subsequently laid
down in the Gloucester Ferry case and the Covington Bridge
case. As this case has not required us to enter into those
considerations we have not done so.

BUTTFIELD v. STRANAHAN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORE.

No. 294. Argued January 4, 1904.-Decided February23, 1904.

Every intendment is in favor of the validity of a statute and it must be presumed to be constitutional unless its repugnancy to the Constitution
clearly appears.
The power of Congress to regulate foreign commerce, being an enumerated
power, is complete in itself, acknowledging no limitations other than those
prescribed in the Constitution, and Congress can, without violating the
due process clause, establish standards and provide from considerations of
public policy that no right shall exist to import an article of food not
equal thereto. No individual has a vested right to trade with foreign
nations superior to the power of Congress to determine what, and upon
what terms, articles may be imported into the United States.

Where a statute acts on a subject as far as practicable and only leaves to
executive officials the duty of bringing about the result pointed out, and

provided for it is not unconstitutional as vesting executive officers with
legislative powers. Fieldv. Clark, 143 U. S. 649.
The act of March 2, 1897, 29 Stat. 604, to prevent the importation of impure and unwholesome tea is not unconstitutional either because the
power conferred to establish standards is legislative and cannot be delegated by Congress to administrative officers; because persons affected
thereby have a vested interest to import teas which are in fact pure though
below the standard fixed; because the establishment. of and enforcement of
the standard qualities constitutes a deprivation of property without due
process of law; because it does not provide for notice and opportunity to
be heard before the rejection of the tea; or, because the power to destroy
goods upon the expiration of the time limit without a judicial proceeding
is a condemnation and taking of property without due process of law.

THis case presents for determination the question of the
constitutionality of a statute known as the tea inspection act,
approved March 2, 1897, 29 Stat. 604. The act is copied in
full in the margin.'
I An Act To prevent the importation of impure and unwholesome tea.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That from and after May first, eighteen
hundred and ninety-seven, it shall be unlawful for any person or persons
or corporation to import or bring into the United States any merchandise
as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the
standards provided in section three of this act, and the importation of all
such merchandise is hereby prohibited.
SEC. 2. That immediately after the passage of this act, and on or before
February fifteenth of each year thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury
shall appoint a board, to consist of seven members, each of whom shall be
an expert in teas, and who shall prepare and submit to him standard samples
of tea; that the persons so appointed shall be at all times subject to removal
by the said Secretary, and shall serve for the term of one year; that vacancies
in the said board occurring by removal, death, resignation, or any other
cause shall be forthwith filled by the Secretary of the Treasury by appointment, such appointee to hold for the unexpired term; that said board shall
appoint a presiding officer, who shall be the medium of all communications
to or from such board; that each member of said board shall receive as compensation the sum of fifty dollars per annum, which, together with all necessary expenses while engaged upon the duty herein provided, shall be paid
out of the appropriation for "expenses of c6llecting the revenue from customs."
SEC. 3. That the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of

Statement of the Case.

192 U. S.

On January 20, 1902, eight packages of tea were imported
into the port of New York, per the steamer Adana, by a firm
of which the plaintiff in error was the general partner. The
tea was entered for import at the New York custom-house,
the said board, shall fix and establish uniform standards of purity, quality,
and fitness for consumption of all kinds of teas imported into the United
States, and shall procure and deposit in the custom-houses of the ports of
New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and such other ports as he may determine, duplicate samples of such standards; that said Secretary shall procure
a sufficient number of other duplicate samples of such standards to supply
the importers and dealers in tea at all ports desiring the same at cost. All
teas, or merchandise described as tea, of inferior purity, quality, and fitness
for consumption to such standards shall be deemed within the prohibition
of the first section hereof.
SEc. 4. That on making entry at the custom-house of all teas, or merchandise described as tea, imported into the United States, the importer
or consignee shall give a bond to the collector of the port that such merchandise shall not be removed from the warehouse until released by the collector,
after it shall have been duly examined with reference to its purity, quality,
and fitness for consumption; that for the purpose of such examination samples of each line in every invoice of tea shall be submitted by the importer
or consignee to the examiner, together with the sworn statement of such
importer or consignee that such samples represent the true quality of each
and every part of the invoice and accord with the specifications therein
contained; or in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, such samples
shall be obtained by the examiner and compared by him with the standards
established by this act; and in cases where said tea, or merchandise described as tea, is entered at ports where there is no qualified examiner as
provided in section seven, the consignee or importer shall in the manner
aforesaid furnish under oath a sample of each line of tea to the collector or
other revenue officer to whom is committed the collection of duties, and said
officer shall also draw or cause to be drawn samples of each line in every invoice and shall forward the same to a duly qualified examiner as provided
in section seven: Provided,however, That the bond above required shall also
be conditioned for the payment of all custom-house charges which may
attach to such merchandise prior to its being released or destroyed (as the
case may be) under the provisions of this act.
Sac. 5. That if, after an examination as provided in section four, the tea
is found by the examiner to be equal in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards hereinbefore provided, and no reexamination
shall be demanded by the collector as provided in section six, a permit shall
at once be granted to the importer or consignee declaring the tea free from

the control of the custom authorities; but if on examination such tea, or
merchandise described as tea, is found, in the opinion of the examiner, to be
inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the said standards
the importer or consignee shall be immediately notified, and the tea, or
merchandise described as tea, shall not be released by the custom-house,
unless on a reexamination called for by the importer or consignee the finding
of the examiner shall be found to be erroneous: Provided, That should a
portion of the invoice be passed by the examiner, a permit shall be granted
for that portion and the remainder held for further examination, as provided in section six.
SEc. 6. That in case the collector, importer or consignee shall protest
against the finding of the examiner, the matter in dispute shall be referred
for decision to a board of three United States general appraisers, to be designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, and if such board shall, after due
examination, find the tea in question to be equal in purity, quality, and
fitness for consumption to the proper standards, a permit shall be issued by
the collector for its release and delivery to the importer; but if upon such
final reexamination by such board the tea shall be found to be inferior in
purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the said standards, the importer or consignee shall give a bond, with security satisfactory to the collector, to export said tea or merchandise described as tea, out of the limits
of the United States within a period of six months after such final reiexamination; and if the same shall not have been exported within the time specified, the collector, at the expiration of that time, shall cause the same to be
destroyed.

term quality as thus used was meant the cup quality of the
tea, that is to say, its taste and flavor. An appeal was taken
by the importer to the board of general appraisers, and that
board, on March 10, 1902, certified to the collector that "the
said tea is inferior in quality to the standard prescribed by
law," and accordingly overruled the appeal. The firm was
notified of the decision on March 12, 1902.
In November following the plaintiff in error-who had
acquired the interest of his partner in the tea-applied to the
collector for permission to withdraw the tea for consumption,
on payment of the duties. The request was refused. Application was then made for the release of the tea from bond in
order to export it. This was also refused on the ground that
the tea had been finally rejected under the act of March 2,
1897, more than six months previous to the application. The
plaintiff in error was also notified that the tea would be ordered
to the public stores for destruction.
This action was commenced in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, county of New York, against the collector
of the port of New York, to recover damages for the alleged
wrongful seizure, removal and destruction of the tea in question. Averments were made of the importation, storing, tender
of duties and refusal to accept the same, and of demand for the
tea and refusal to deliver. A general denial was filed. The
action being on account of acts done by the defendant under
the revenue laws of the United States, as collector of customs,
it was removed on his application to the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York.

on which this act goes into effect.

BUTTFIELD v. STRANAIIAN.
192 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

As indicated on this exhibit, the Country green teas thereon
designated were arranged in their order of quality, from the
highest to the lowest, No. 1 being the highest grade, and
No. 17 the lowest. The designation in each perpendicular
column represented the teas grown in a particular district,
and all the teas enumerated on the same horizontal line were
considered as being equal in grade.
The chairman of the Board of Tea Experts of the Treasury
Department testified that the standard for Country green teas
in force at the time the tea in question was imported was
Hyson of a Fine Teenkai, or No. 6 on the list of standards, and
that before fixing this standard "the board made diligent
search for any Country green teas of lower grades-Hysons
of lower grades-of pure teas on the New York market obtainable by the trade, and were unable to find any." The
term Hyson, it may be observed, indicated that the tea was
made out of the coarsest leaves. For the plaintiff it was
testified that the quality of the tea in controversy corresponded in quality with the grade No. 7 on Exhibit 8; while
the evidence for the government was to the effect that it
would grade as Fair Fychow, No. 11 on Exhibit 8. The testimony also tended to show that the tea in question differed
only in respect to the cup quality from the government standard; the evidence for the government being that it was "a tea
of a decidedly low grade,

.

.

.

a pure tea, but of low

quality."
At the close of the evidence the court overruled a motion
to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, and an exception was reserved. Thereupon the court, granting a motion on behalf
of the defendant, instructed that the only question was as to
the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant, as collector of the port acted, and directed a verdict in
his favor. Upon the judgment entered on the verdict, which
was returned in accordance with this instruction, the case
was brought directly to this court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

192 U. S.

Mr. James L. Bishop, with whom Mr. James H. Simpson was on the brief, for plaintiff in error, in this case and in
294 and 516, which were argued simultaneously therewith :
The act is unconstitutional, because (1) it makes the right
to import tea depend upon the arbitrary action of the Secretary
of the Treasury and a board appointed by him, and (2) excludes from import wholesome, genuine and unadulterated tea,
and (3) discriminates unequally in the admission of the different
kinds of teas for import, and in the right to sell and purchase
tea. The act confers upon the secretary and the board the
uncontrolled power to fix standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption, and thus to prescribe arbitrarily what
teas may be imported and dealt in.
For cases on this statute, see Sang Lang v. Jackson, 85 Fed.
Rep. 502; Cruikshank v. Bidwell, 86 Fed. Rep. 7; S. C., 176
U. S. 73; Buttfield v. Bidwell, 94 Fed. Rep. 126; S. C., 96 Fed.
Rep. 328.
The words "fitness for consumption" give the Secretary of
the Treasury unlimited power to exclude teas according to his
idea of fitness for consumption. An article which one man
or class of men might regard as entirely fit for consumption
might be regarded by another man or class of men as utterly
unfit.
It appears from the history of the legislation that it was
the intention of Congress to confer unlimited power upon
the Secretary. See act of March 2, 1883, c. 64; act of 1890,
c. 339; and see Buttfield cases, cited supra.
The constitutionality of the statute was not raised in the
former proceedings. The application proceeded upon the assumption that the law was constitutional.
The act as heretofore construed excludes all teas from import except such as are equal to standards fixed by the uncontrolled will of the Secretary of the Treasury on the recommendation of the board of appraisers.
The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and
between the States is subject to such limitations as are pre-

General police power being exclusively within the control
of the States, Congress cannot exercise such general police
powers under the power to regulate commerce. Lottery Cases,
188 U. S.364, dissenting opinions; License Cases, 5 How. 594,

trade between the States in a wholesome article of commerce,
or to place such interstate commerce in the arbitrary control
of -anindividual or of a board. J. R. Tucker, 4 Ry. & Corp.

commerce with foreign nations, the laws which it makes
for carrying into execution these powers must be "necessary
and proper." Const. Art. 1, sec. 8, par. 18; McCulloch v.

As to extent and definition of the police power the point at
which the demands of government thereunder are restrained
by the paramount constitutional guaranties of liberty and
property cannot be fixed, but must be left to be determined
by the process of exclusion, as applied to particular cases; and
the question whether that limit has been overreached in a
particular instance must always be a judicial question. This
proposition, although now supported by the weight of authority, has not at all times met with approval. Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678. But see Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch, 137, 176; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 468; Lawton v.
Steele, 152 U. S. 133; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366; Cotting
v. Goddard, 183 U. S. 83, 86; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co.,
184 U. S. 540, 558.
As the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law
of the land, anything in the Constitution or statutes to the contrary notwithstanding, a statute of a State even when avowedly
enacted in the exercise of its police power must yield to that
law.
This opinion is confirmed by the latest and best considered
opinions of the state courts. Noel v. The People, 187 Illinois,

The act violates the Fifth Amendment, because it permanently deprives the plaintiff and other citizens of their right

to trade in a beneficial and wholesome article, except at the
uncontrolled will of the Secretary of the Treasury and a board
appointed by him.

This is not inconsistent with anything decided by this court
under the Alien Exclusion laws, which rest on the power of
Congress to exclude aliens which is incident to every sovereign
power. Lem Moon Sing v. United States, 158 U. S. 538; Chae

as competent to perform, and if one employing him suffers
damages by reason of his want of skill, he is liable therefor.
The statutory provisions are intended to safeguard the community against the want of skill which is actionable when
resulting in damages.
The rules adopted by any board for the admission of persons
to, such pursuits must be adapted to and be suitable for the
determination of such fitness and skill. Requirements which
have no such relation to such calling or profession, or which
are unattainable by reasonable study and application, or which
are arbitrary, deprive one of his right to pursue a lawful avocation, and statutes permitting such requirements are invalid.

No such standard can be applied to teas.

by the courts, Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 125; Rietz

People v. Gage, MSS. opinion, nor by bill in equity, Sang Lung
v. Jackson; Buttfield v. Bidwell, supra, nor otherwise.
Apart from the arbitrary power lodged with the Secretary,
the act is unconstitutional because it prevents the plaintiff
and others from dealing in a wholesome and ordinary article
of commerce, and destroys a trade in which he and others had
been engaged. It has never been decided that under the
police power a perfectly harmless trade could be prohibited.

New Hampshire, 171 U. S. 30. And as to other matters,

138 U. S. 78; Railroad Co. v. Husen, 95 U. S. 465; Allgeyer
v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578.
That the Legislature may not, under guise of police regulation, prohibit trade in wholesome articles is-supported by other
authorities. Dorsey v. Texas, 40 L. R. A. 201; Helena v.
Dwyer, 39 L. R. A. 266; Baltimore v. Radecke, 49 Maryland, 417.
Cases like Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S. -461, 476;
People v. Arnsberg, 105 N. Y. 123; Booth v. Illinois, 184 U. S.
425; Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, are not in conflict with this
position.
The constitutional validity of a law is to be decided not by
what has been done under it, but what may by its authority
be done and if the act be construed according to its language
as interpreted by the courts below the Secretary and the board
have the right to fix a standard which will exclude wholesome
tea. Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 183, 188; Montana Co. v. St.
Louis, M. & M. Co., 152 U. S.160, 170; People v. Mosher, 163
N. Y. 32, 42; Colon v. Lisk, 153 N. Y. 194; Gilman v. Tucker,
128 N. Y. 190.
The act is unconstitutional because it discriminates unequally
in the importation of different kinds of tea and, therefore,
denies the plaintiff the equal administration of the laws. It
is a sumptuary law and interferes with the right of a man to
do what he will do with his own. Cooley Const. Lim. (7th ed.)
549; People v. Budd, 143 U. S.517. It is a weapon which may
be used to destroy the business of competitors. Connolly v.
Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 558; People v. Marx, 99
N. Y. 380.
This law ought not to be sustained because the establishment of this precedent will open the door to methods of government which experience has shown to be fatal to liberty.

The act is unconstitutional because it attempts to delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury and a board named by
him legislative powers which can only be exercised by Congress.
The power to regulate commerce cannot be delegated.

While the legislature may delegate powers not legislative
which it may rightfully exercise itself, Wayman v. Southard,
10 Wheat. 43, it cannot under the guise of conferring discretion confer an authority to make the law.
By this statute all teas are excluded from import. No one
has a right to import tea until the Secretary makes a standard.
He, therefore, makes the right.
Executive officers are frequently empowered to make regulations to carry into effect duties imposed upon them. These
are rules and methods of administration not laws. The act
is not confined to establishing a standard of purity only. Morrell v. Jones, 106 U. S. 466; United States v. Eaton, 144 U. S.
677; United States v. Three Barrels of Whiskey, 77 Fed. Rep.
963.
It has been repeated-y held that under the power to make
regulations the Executive can neither extend nor contract the
law. Balfour v. Sullivan, 19 Fed. Rep. 578; Pascal v. Sulli-

van, 21 Fed. Rep. 496; Siegfried v. Phelps, 40 Fed. Rep. 660,
and cases above cited.
The cases cited by defendant in error can be distinguished
from this case.
The act is unconstitutional in not providing for notice
and an opportunity to be heard before the rejection of the
tea.
The act itself must provide for the notice, if not specifically
it should fix the time and place for the hearing. The Railroad Tax Cases, 13 Fed. Rep. 722, 752, 753; Kuntz v. Sumption, 117 Indiana, 1; S. C., 2 L. R. A. 655; Reetz v. Michigan,
188 U. S. 505, 509; Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 186. Voluntary notice will not suffice, because what is conferred
as a favor to-day may be. withheld to-morrow. As to what
is due process of law, see Turpin v. Lemon, 187 U. S. 58;
Hagar v. Reclamation District, 111 U. S. 701; Simon v. Craft,
182 U. S. 427, 436; Lent v. Tillson, 140 U. S. 316; Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 107; Palmer v. McMahon,
133 U. S. 66; Passavant v. United States, 148 U. S. 214,
222.
This is not a proceeding for the collection of public revenue,
in which cases summary remedies may be used which could
not be applied in cases of a judicial character. King v. Mullins,
171 U. S. 429; Bells Gap R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S.
232, 239.
The act is unconstitutional because it authorizes the confiscation of the importer's property without due process of
law, as was the fact in the Stranahancase.
These teas were not a nuisance. Yates v. Milwaukee, 10
Wall. 497.
There was no trial as to whether the teas were lawfully
rejected and whether the time for their removal had expired.
None of these or other questions were concluded by the finding of the board of general appraisers. Colon v. Lisk, 153

Ridgway v. West, 60 Indiana, 371.
In Buttfield v. Bidwell (No. 296), the evidence establishes a
case of personal liability against the defendant.
The teas having been entered for import at the customhouse, were in the control of the collector. Conrad v. Pacific
Ins. Co., 6 Pet. 262, 281; Tracy v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 80.
It is not sought to hold the collector liable for the negligence,
misconduct or other wrongful act of a subordinate official, but
for duress of goods under a duty imposed upon him by an
unconstitutional law. United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196;
Stanley v. Schwartz, 147 U. S. 508, 518.
Officials acting under unconstitutional statutes which are
ineffectual to protect them, are liable for damages sustained
by their wrongful act or where officials have been restrained
from proceeding to enforce such unconstitutional law. Osborn
v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738; Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 270;
Pennoyer v. McConaughy, 140 U. S. 1; Smith v. Ames, 169
U. S. 466; Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 56; Tendal v. Wesley, 167
U. S. 204. The same thing is true whenever an official, exceeding his lawful powers, inflicts an injury under color of
office. Siegfried v. Phelps, 40 Fed. Rep. 660; Leslin v. Hedden,
28 Fed. Rep. 416; Pascalv. Sullivan, 21 Fed. Rep. 496.
The rule that an officer is not liable for the tortious acts of
his subordinate has no application where the act performed is
a duty imposed by a law. Cleveland &c. Ry. Co. v. McClung,
119 U. S. 454; Belknap v. Achild, 161 U. S. 10, 18; Iselin v.
Hedden, 28 Fed. Rep. 416; Head v. Porter, 48 Fed. Rep. 482.
Where a public officer has established a regulation in the
course of business that he will not do a certain act except upon
certain terms which are illegal, or that he will not accept payment except upon conditions that he has no right to impose,
a tender and demand are waived. United States v. Lee, 106
U. S. 196; Swift v. United States, 101 U. S. 22.
In the Seven Package case the plaintiff in error is not estopped by giving a bond under duress, from questioning the

constitutionality of the act. If the act was unconstitutional
the bond was plainly void as being without consideration, and
extorted by duress, and the giving of the bond under such circumstances would not operate as an estoppel. O'Brien v.
Wheelock, 184 U. S. 450; Coburn v. Townsend, 103 California,
233; Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), vol. 4, p. 667.
If the act is unconstitutional for any of the reasons argued
it is wholly void because it is impossible to sever the invalid

In construing an act not only is prior legislation in pari

The former act in pari materiawas the act of March 2, 1883,

The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations includes the power to prohibit the importation of these lowgrade teas. United States v. Brigantine Williams, 2 Hall's L. J.

321, 354, 374; United States v. Realty Co., 163 U. S. 427; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Imp. Co., 18 How. 272. As
to governmental limitations on foreign commerce, see licenses
granted to individuals showing powers of government. Leone
Levi, History of British Commerce (2d ed.), pp. 30, 109, 235,
236; Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, Book IV, c. I; New
York Statutes of March 15, 1781, c. 29; 9 Hening's Virginia
Statutes, 1778, p. 532; 2 Stat. 500, 506.
The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, being
an enumerated power, is entirely unlimited so long as it does
not violate any of the specific constitutional restrictions upon
legislative authority. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 353, 356.
An enumerated power is "distinct and independent, to be
exercised in any case whatever." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. at p. 421; Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U. S.
535, 541. It acknowledges no limitations other than those
prescribed in the Constitution. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S.

266, 267; Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345.
The intent of the statute is, and for proper reason, to exclude

teas of inferior quality though sufficiently pure and not unwholesome, so decided in Buttfield v. Bidwell, 96 Fed. Rep. 328.
The word "quality" must not be regarded as surplusage and

significance of every word in a statute, see Bacon's Abridgment, § 2; Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S. 112, 115. The
act is remedial and is to be construed as such. United States
v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1. The fact that the title is narrower
than the scope of the act is immaterial.
The title may be used in construing a statute when the body
of the statute is ambiguous; but the ambiguity must be found
in the word to be construed or in its context, and not in the
title. Pattersonv. Bark Eudora, 190 U. S. 169, and cases cited;
Hadden v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 107, 110.
For incongruities between titles and matter of acts of Congress, sponges used to appear under the heading of "Chemicals, oils, or paints," and cork under "Flax, hemp, and jute."
See 21 Atty. Gen. Opin. 67; Hollender v. Magone, 149 U. S. 586,
591; Seeberger v. Schlesinger, 152 U. S. 581, 583.
The statute being based upon an unlimited power of Congress,
it is unnecessary to argue in its justification.
The delegation of details to the Secretary of the Treasury
was proper, and indeed absolutely necessary. There is nothing
new about the establishment of physical standards. The
Treasury Department at an early day had established standards
of weight and measure. 5 Stat. 133, and for other instances,
see 14 Stat. 560; Rev. Stat. § 2916; 13 Stat. 202; Rev. Stat.
§ 2914; Merritt v. Welsh, 104 U. S. 694, 702.
The line between the province of the legislature and that of
the executive is difficult to determine, Wayman v. Southard,
10 Wheat. 1, 46; In re Oliver, 17 Wisconsin, 681, and the statute
is to be given the benefit of any doubt. Carrying into affect
in detail the legislative will is generally left to executive officers,
although the details may be settled by the legislature if it desires to do so.

Opinion of the Court.

Due process of law was not denied to the plaintiff. Origel v.
Hedden, 155 U. S. 228, 236; Auffmordt v. Hedden, 137 U. S. 310,
323. The finding was final and the importer's only remedy
was by appeal to the dispensing power of the Secretary of the
Treasury. Passavantv. United States, 148 U. S. 214; Origet v.
Hedden, supra, at p. 236. This "additional duty" was a penalty in the strictest sense of the word. 4 Op. 182; 20 Op. 660.
A person who imports nonimportable goods may properly
be put to the expense of taking them away again. The case
is similar to that of the return of an alien immigrant at the
expense of the transportation company that has brought him
into our ports. Acts of Sept. 13, 1888, c. 1015; March 3, 1891,
c. 551. Under these statutes the inspectors are not required
to take any testimony; their decision is absolutely final.

Moon Sing v. United States, 158 U. S. 538; Chin Bak Kan
v. United States, 186 U. S. 192.
Plaintiff was not damnified by the act of 1897 or by the
standard of 1901. Either his loss is due to his own failure to
notify his buyers in China; or it is due to their default, for
which he is responsible as against others and they are responsible to him; or it is due to a plan of his own to import teas
below the standard, procure a judgment establishing the
unconstitutionality of the act, and thus undersell his competitors.
MR. JUSTICE WRITE, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The assignments of error assail the act of the trial court in
denying the motion for the direction of a verdict in favor of
plaintiff and in giving a peremptory instruction in.favor of the
defendant. Summarized, the contentions are as follows:
1, that the act of March 2, 1897, confers authority to establish standards, and that such power is legislative and
cannot constitutionally be delegated by Congress to administrative officers ; 2, that the plaintiff in error had a vested

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

right to engage as a trader in foreign commerce and as such
to import teas into the United States, which as a matter of
fact were pure, wholesome and free from adulteration, fraud
and deception, and which were fit for consumption; 3, that
the establishment and enforcement of standards of quality
of teas, which operated to deprive the alleged vested right,
constituted a deprivation of property without due process of
law; 4, that the act is unconstitutional, because it does not
provide that notice and an opportunity to be heard be afforded
an importer before the rejection of his tea by the tea examiner,
or the Tea Board of General Appraisers; and, 5, that in any
event the authority conferred by the statute to destroy goods
upon the expiration of the time limit for their removal for
export and the destruction of such property, without a judicial
proceeding, was condemnation of property without hearing
and the taking thereof without due process of law.
Whether the contentions just stated are tenable are the
questions for consideration.
In examining the statute in order to determine its constitutionality we must be guided by the well-settled rule that every
intendment is in favor of its validity. It must be presumed
to be constitutional, unless its repugnancy to the Constitution
clearly appears. Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 514, 515;
Gettysburg Park Case, 160 U. S. 668, 680.
The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations is
expressly conferred upon Congress, and being an enumerated
power is complete in itself, acknowledging no limitations other
than those prescribed in the Constitution. Lottery Case, 188
U. S. 321, 353-356; Leisy v. Hardin,135 U. S. 100, 108. Whatever difference of opinion, if any, may have existed or does
exist concerning the limitations of the power, resulting from
other provisions of the Constitution, so far as interstate commerce is concerned, it is not to be doubted that from the beginning Congress has exercised a plenary power in respect to the
exclusion of merchandise brought from foreign countries; not
alone directly by the enactment of embargo statutes, but

BUTTFIELD v. STRANAHAN.
192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

indirectly as a necessary result of provisions contained in
tariff legislation. It has also, in other than tariff legislation,
exerted a police power over foreign commerce by provisions
which in and of themselves amounted to the assertion of the
right to exclude merchandise at discretion. This is illustrated
by statutory provisions which have been in force for more than
fifty years, regulating the degree of strength of drugs, medicines and chemicals entitled to admission into the United
States and excluding such as did not equal the standards
adopted. 9 Stat. 237; Rev. Stat. sec. 2933 et seq.
The power to regulate foreign commerce is certainly as
efficacious as that to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes.
And this last power was referred to in United States v. 43 Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188, 194, as exclusive and absolute, and
was declared to be "as broad and as free from restrictions as
that to regulate commerce with foreign nations." In that
case it was held that it was competent for Congress to extend
the prohibition against the unlicensed introduction and sale
of spirituous liquors in the Indian country to territory in
proximity to that occupied by the Indians, thus restricting
commerce with them. We entertain no doubt that it was
competent for Congress, by statute, under the power to regulate foreign commerce, to establish standards and provide
that no right should exist to import teas from foreign countries
into the United States, unless such teas should be equal to the
standards.
As a result of the compl6te power of Congress over foreign
commerce, it necessarily follows that no individual has a vested
right to trade with foreign nations, which is so broad in character as to limit and restrict the power of Congress to determine
what articles of merchandise may be imported into this country
and the terms upon which a right to import may be exercised.
This being true, it results that a statute which restrains the
introduction of particular goods into the United States from
considerations of public policy does not violate the due process
clause of the Constitution.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

That the act of March 2, 1897, was not an exercise by Congress of purely arbitrary power is evident from the terms of the
law, and a consideration of the circumstances which led to its
enactment. The history of the act and its proper construction,
as also the reasons for deciding that the regulations of the
Secretary of the Treasury establishing the standard here in
question were warranted by the statute, were succinctly stated
in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in Buttfleld v. Bidwell, 96 Fed. Rep. 328, and we adopt such
statement. The court said:
"The basic question in this case is as to the true construction
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1897, entitled 'An act to
prevent the importation of impure and unwholesome tea.'
Section I makes it unlawful 'to import or bring into the United
States any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards provided in
section 3 of this act, and the importation of all such merchandise is hereby prohibited.' Section 2 provides for the appointment by the Secretary of the Treasury, immediately after the
passage of the act, and on or before February 15 of each subsequent year, of the board of tea experts, 'who shall prepare
and submit to him standard samples of tea.' Section 3 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of said board, 'shall fix and establish uniform standards
of purity, quality and fitness for consumption of all kinds of
teas imported into the United States,' samples of such standards
to be deposited in various custom-houses, and supplied to importers and dealers at cost, and declares that "all teas, or merchandise described as tea, of ihferior purity, quality and fitness
for consumption to such standards shall be deemed to be within
the prohibition of the first section hereof." Sections 4-7 provide
for the examination of importations of tea, for a reexamination
by the board of general appraisers in case of a protest by the
importer or collector against the finding of the primary examiner, and for testing the purity, quality and fitness for consumption in all cases of examination or reexamination, 'ac-

cording to the usages and customs of the tea trade, including
the test of an infusion of the same in boiling water, and, if
necessary, chemical analysis.'

.

.

The history of the

enactment shows that the word ('quality') was industriously
inserted to make the act a more stringent substitute for the
existing legislation. By the act of March 3, 1883, then in
force, any merchandise imported 'for sale as tea,' adulterated
with spurious or exhausted leaves, or containing such an admixture of deleterious substances as to make it 'unfit for use,'
was prohibited; and exhausted leaves were defined to include
any tea which had been deprived of its proper quality, strength,
or virtue by steeping, infusion, decoction, or other means.
Thus the importation of tea containing such an admixture of
leaves as to be deprived of its proper quality or virtue by any
method of treatment was prohibited. The act, however, contained no provision for the establishment of government standards; and the establishment of uniform standards in the interest
of the importer and of the consumer had become a recognized
necessity. In a report by the Senate Committee on Commerce, in 1897, the provision was suggested as designed,
among other things, to protect the consumer against 'worthless rubbish,' and insure his 'receiving an article fit for use.'
The report pointed out that the 'lowest average grade of tea
ever before known was now being used' by our consumers, and
proposed as a remedy the establishment of standards of the
'lowest grades of tea fit for use.' As originally introduced in
the House, the bill prohibited the importation of 'any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity or fitness for consumption to the standards provided in section 3 of this act.'
It was amended in the Senate by inserting the word 'quality'
between the words 'purity' and 'fitness for consumption'
wherever they occurred in the House bill. The amendment
evinces the intention of the Senate to authorize the adoption
of uniform standards by the Secretary of the Treasury which
would be adequate to exclude the .lowest grades of tea, whether
demonstrably of inferior purity, or unfit for consumption, or

presumably or possibly so because of their inferior quality.
The House concurred in the amendment, and the measure was
enacted in its present terms. We conclude that the regulations
of the Secretary of the Treasury are warranted by the provisions of the act."
The claim that the statute commits to the arbitrary discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury the determination of what
teas may be imported, and therefore in effect vests that official
with legislative power, is without merit. We are of opinion
that the statute, when properly construed, as said by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, but expresses the purpose to exclude
the lowest grades of tea, whether demonstrably of inferior
purity, or unfit for consumption, or presumably so because of
their inferior quality. This, in effect, was the fixing of a
primary standard, and devolved upon the Secretary of the
Treasury the mere executive duty to effectuate the legislative
policy declared in the statute. The case is within the principle
of Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, where it was decided that the
third section of the tariff act of October 1, 1890, was not repugnant to the Constitution as conferring legislative and
treaty-making power on the President, because it authorized
him to suspend the provisions of the act relating to the free
introduction of sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides. We
may say of the legislation in this case, as was said of the legislation considered in Field v. Clark, that it does not, in any real
sense, invest administrative officials with the power of legislation. Congress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable, and from the necessities of the case was
compelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing
about the result pointed out by the statute. To deny the
power of Congress to delegate such a duty would, in effect,
amount but to declaring that the plenary power vested in
Congress to regulate foreign commerce could not be efficaciously exerted.
Whether or not the Secretary of the Treasury failed to carry
into effect the expressed purpose of Congress and established

standards which operated to exclude teas which would have
been entitled to admission had proper standards been adopted,
is a question we are not called upon to consider. The sufficiency of the standards adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury was committed to his judgment, to be honestly exercised,
and if that were important there is no assertion here of bad
faith or malice on the part of that officer in fixing the standards,
or on the part of the defendant in the performance of the duties
resting on him.
It is urged that there was denial of due process of law in
failing to accord plaintiff in error a hearing before the Board of
Tea Inspectors and the Secretary of the Treasury in establishing
the standard in question, and before the general appraisers upon
the reexamination of the tea. Waiving the point that the
plaintiff in error does not appear to have asked for a hearing,
and assuming that the statute did not confer such a right, we
are of opinion that the statute was not objectionable for that
reason. The provisions in respect to the fixing of standards
and the examination of samples by government experts was
for the purpose of determining whether the conditions existed
which conferred the right to import, and they therefore in no
just sense concerned a taking of property. This latter question
was intended by Congress to be finally settled, not by a judicial
proceeding, but by the action of the agents of the government,
upon whom power on the subject was conferred.
It remains only to consider the contention that the provision
of the statute commanding the destruction of teas not exported
within six months after their final rejection was unconstitutional. The importer was charged with notice of the provisions of the law, and the conditions upon which teas might be
brought from abroad, with a view to their introduction into
the United States for consumption. Failing to establish the
right to import, because of the inferior quality of the merchandise as compared with the standard, the duty was imposed
upon the importer to perform certain requirements, and to take
the goods from the custody of the authorities within a period

of time fixed by the statute, which was ample in duration.
He was notified of the happening of the various contingencies
requiring positive action on his part. The duty to take such
action was enjoined upon him, and if he failed to exercise it
the collector was under the obligation after the expiration of
the time imit to destroy the goods. That plaintiff in error
had knowledge of the various steps taken with respect to the
tea, including the final rejection by the board of general appraisers, is conceded. We think the provision of the statute
complained of was not wanting in due process of law.
