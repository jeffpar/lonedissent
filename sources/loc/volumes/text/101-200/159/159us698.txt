privilege, or immunity is claimed under that instrument, but
a definite issue in respect of the possession of the right must
be distinctly deducible from the record before the judgment
of the court below can be revised on the ground of error in
the disposal of such a claim by its decision. And it is only
when the constitutiofiality of a law of the United States is
drawn in question, not incidentally but necessarily and directly,
that our jurisdiction can be invoked for that reason. Borgmeyer v. Idler, 159 U. S. 408; Garey v. Railway Company, 150
U. S. 170; _14 re -Lennon, 150 U. S. 395 ; Northern Pacific
Railroad Company v. Amato, 144 U. S. 465, 472; Sayward v.
Denny, 158 U. S. 180. An assignment of errors cannot be
availed of to import questions into a cause which the record
does not show were raised in the court below and rulings
asked thereon, so as to give jurisdiction to this court under
the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1891.
Writ of error dismissed.

LITTLE ROCK &c. [A1LROA1) v. EAST TENN. &c. CO. 699
Opinion of the Court.

MR. CHIEF JuSTIcE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the

court.
This was a bill in equity filed by the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company against the East Tennessee, Virginia
and Georgia Railroad Company and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad Company in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Western District of Tennessee, April
13, 1889, praying for a mandatory injunction against the
defendants, requiring them to afford complainant "the same
equal facilities as are afforded to any other connecting road,
and for such other relief as may be deemed equitable." Defendants filed their joint and several demurrers July 17, 1889,
and on the first of October, 1891, the cause having theretofore
been submitted to the court, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill of complaint for want of equity, from which
decree complainant prayed an appeal to this court, which was
allowed and duly perfected.
By the fifth section of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891,
c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, appeals or writs of error can be taken
directly to this court in six classes of cases there enumerated,
and the case before us falls within none of them. Jurisdiction
as existing before the passage of the act was preserved by a
joint resolution of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1115, as to pending
cases and cases wherein the writ of. error or appeal should be
sued out or taken before July 1, 1891. In this case the decree was not rendered until the first day of October of that
year. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. National
Exchange Bank v. Peters, 144 UT. S. 570.
By the sixteenth section of the interstate commerce act, (24:
Stat. c. 104, 379; 25 Stat. c. 382, 855,) it was provided that
where the commission had made any lawful order or requirement, and a party refused to obey or perform it, it should be
lawful for the commission, or any person or company interested therein, to apply to the Circuit Court sitting in equity
for the enforcement of such order; and it was further provided, in respect of the action of the Circuit Court, that
"Whenever the subject in dispute shall be of the value of two

thousand dollars or more, either party to such proceeding before said court may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States, under the same regulations now provided by law in respect of security for such appeal." In Interstate Commerce
Commission v. Railroad Company, 149 U. S. 264, where an
appeal was taken directly to this court after July 1, 1891, from
ten order in a proceeding under that act, we held that it would
not lie. Certainly there can be no different result in this case.
Appeal dismissed.
