HOLZAPFEL'S COMPOSITIONS COMPANTY v. RAHTJEN'S AMERICAN COMPOSITION COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 54. Argued April 25, 26,1901.-Decided October 21, 101.

This was a controversy relating to a trade-mark for protective
paint for
ships' bottoms. The Court held:
(1) That no valid trade-mark was proved on the part of the Rnhtjens
Company in connection with paint sent from Germany to their
agents in the United States, prior to 1873, when they procured
a
patent in England for their composition;
(2) That no right to a trade-mark which includes the.word "patent,"
and which describes the article as "patented," can arise when
there has been no patent;
(3) That a symbol or label claimed as a trade-mark, so constituted
or
worded as to make or contain a distinct assertion which is false,
will not be recognized, and no right to its exclusive use can be
maintained;
(4) That of necessity when the right to manufacture became public,
the
right to use the only word descriptive of the article manufactured
became public also;
(5) That no right to the exclusive use in the United States of the
words
"Rahtjen's Compositions" has been shown.

TiE respondent, a New York corporation, commenced this
suit in equity in the Circuit Court for the Southern District of

VOL. CLXXXI-1

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

New York, against the petitioner, which is a foreign corpora-

tion, organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Great Britain,
and having a place of business in the city of New York, to restrain it from the use of the trade-mark which the respondent
averred it had acquired in the name "Rahtjen's Composition"
and to obtain an accounting of the profits and income which
the petitioner had unlawfully derived from the use of such
trade-mark, and which it had by reason thereof diverted from
the respondent. Issue was taken on the various allegations in
the bill, and upon the trial the Circuit Court dismissed the
same, 97 Fed. Rep. 94:9; but upon appeal to the Circuit Court
of Appeals the decree of the Circuit Court was reversed and
the case remanded to that court with instructions to enter a
decree enjoining the petitioner from selling or offering to sell
Rahtjen's Composition under that name, and from using the
name upon its packages or in its advertisements. 101 Fed. Rep.
257; 41 C. C. A. 329.
Judge Wallace dissented from the judgment and opinion of
the Circuit Court of Appeals, holding that the case was properly
decided in the court below, and that the decree ought to be affirmed.
The defendant and petitioner then prayed this court for a
writ of certiorari, which was granted, and the case thus brought
here.
The trade-mark in regard to which this contest arises pertains
to a certain kind of paint for the protection of ships' bottoms
from rust and from vegetable or animal growth thereon, either
in salt or fresh water. The paint was of three kinds, numbered,
respectively, Nos. 1, 2 and 3. The evidence in the record shows
that some time between the years 1860 and 1865, one John
Rahtjen invented in Germany a particular kind of paint for
the purpose above mentioned. In connection with his sons he
began in 1865 to manufacture the paint for general use, and it
speedily acquired a high reputation among owners of shipping
as valuable for the purposes intended. The elder Rahtjen never
obtained a patent for the article in Germany, neither did he
or his sons apply for or obtain one in the United States. They
first shipped some of the paint manufactured by them in Ger-

many to the United States in 1870, consigned to Henry Gelien.
They did not put it upon the market by sending generally to
those who might wish to use it, but all their consignments from
1870 to 1878 were made to Gelien. Under what marks he sold
the article does not appear.
On November 19, 1869, one of the firm wrote to Mr. Gelien
from Bremerhaven, making him the sole agent of the firm for
the sale of its paint in the United States, and informing him
that they had not obtained a patent for their composition in
America nor applied for one in the United States, as there
was no danger in introducing the composition in America, the
invention not being of a nature facilitating good imitations.
The father died in 1873, after which the sons continued the
business.
Gelien was succeeded as the consignee of the paint in the
United States, in 1878, by the firm of Hartmann, La Doux &
Maecker, to whom for a short time the paint was consigned
from Germany, and then it was sent them from England
through Rahtjen's assigns there. The Hartmann firm was
succeeded in July, 1886, by Emil Maecker, as agent for the
sale of the paint in the United States, and on January 1, 1889,
Maecker was succeeded by one Otto L. Petersen, and in 1891
Petersen was succeeded by the respondent corporation, and
was made its president.
On January 15, 1878," Joh" Rahtjen assigned to "Messrs.
Suter, Hartmann & Co., in London, the exclusive right of sale
of my patent composition paint for the United States of North
America, for the period of twelve years from the commencement of 1878 to the end of 1889." After 1870 the firm of
Hartmann Brothers, or Suter, Hartmann & Co., manufactured
the composition for themselves in England, by the license of
the Rahtjens, and for a time after 1874 IRahtjen also manufactured in England as well as in Germany. During this time
the composition when manufactured by Hartmann was marked
" Rahtjen's Patent Composition, Hartmann's Manufacture."
Up to the time of the above assignment the Rlahtjens had consigned their paint to New York in barrels or casks addressed
to Gelien, and with labels affixed thereon, in which the article

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

was described as "Rahtjen's Patent Composition," and after
Hartmann, La Doux & Maecker became agents, the casks were

addressed to that firm at New York and labeled the same way.
While Gelien acted as consignee he prepared and issued a
show card and also letter heads and circulars with "iRahtjen's
Composition Paint, known as the German Paint," on the cards
and on the heading of his letters and circulars, and also directly
underneath was the picture of a vessel. The show cards and
circulars were issued for the purpose of advertising the paint,
and the show card was copyrighted by Gelien for himself.
After the assignment to Suter, Hartmann & Co. of the exclusive right of sale in the United States, and up to the year
1883, that firm sent the paints to the United States under the
description of "iRahtjen's Patent Composition," and the IRahtjens themselves sent no more paint to the United States from
Germany.
In 1873 they entered into negotiations with Suter, Hartmann
& Co., in England, for the sale of their paint in that country, and
on November 29, 1873, Heinrich Rahtjen obtained in England
a patent for the paint for the term of fourteen years from the
date thereof, provided, among other conditions, he should at
the end of seven years pay a stamp duty of one hundred pounds,
and in case he did not pay, the patent was to "cease, determine
and become void." It remained in existence for seven years,
or until November 29, 1880, and then ceased because of the
failure to pay the one hundred pounds stamp duty as provided
for in the patent.
The label used by Suter, Hartmann & Co. in sending the
paint to their different agents and customers contained the words
"Rahtjen's Patent Composition" and "None genuine without
this signature, Suter, Hartmann & Co." These words were used
by them from the outset of their career as consignees for the
composition.
In May, 1883, two years and a half after the expiration of the
English patent, the predecessors of the petitioner commenced in
England to make and sell this paint, and in 1884 they sent it to
the United States under the name of "Rahtjen's Composition,
Holzapfel's Manufacture."

HOLZAPFEL'S CO. v. RABTJEN'S CO.
Statement of the Case.

On June 25, 1883, John :Rahtjen filed with the English office an application for registration as a trade-mark of the words
"Genuine Rahtjen's Composition for Ships' Bottoms," etc. This
application was opposed by Holzapfel & Co., through their solicitors, and no counter-statement having been filed by IRahtjen
the application was deemed to be withdrawn.
On July 7, 1883, Rahtjen filed another application for registration of the words "Rahtjen Composition." This, too, was
opposed, and the application thereafter held to'be withdrawn.
On June 28, 1883, Suter, Hartmann & Co. filed an application
for the registration of the words "Rahtjen's Patent Composition for Ships' Bottoms, Bupys, &c. None genuine without this
signature, Suter, Hartmann & Co." This application was opposed by defendant's predecessors, Holzapfel & Co., and was
withdrawn.
On the 25th of April, 1883, Hartmann Brothers filed an application for a trade-mark in this form:

SUTER, HARTANN & CO.

There has never been any infringement of it by defendant,
but it has used the words "iRahtjen's Composition" in connection with the statement that it was manufactured by Holzapfel
& Co., and it has so used them on goods sold in the United
States, and did so at the time of the commencement of this
suit.
Before the assignment to Suter, Hartmann & Co. of the exclusive right to sell the composition in the United States, Rahtjen had transferred to Hartmann Brothers in England the exclusive right to manufacture it there, and so in their manufacture it was described as "lRahtjen's Composition. Hartmann Brothers' :Manufacture."
In 1888, Suter, Hartmann & Rahtjen's Composition Company (Limited) was formed, and Suter, Hartmann & Co. assigned their rights and interests in the paint and trade-mark
to that company, and in 1891 the respondent company was
formed and the English company transferred to it all rights
to the trade-marks belonging to and used by the English company in America, and agreed not to carry on any business of a
like character in the United States.
In 1899 complaint was made before the Court of Commerce,
sitting at Antwerp, by Rahtjen and by Suter, Hartmann & Co.

Statement of the Case.

against defendant W. Wright, in which they complained of the
defendant that he had put on the sign of his house the inscription "Manufacturers of Rahtjen's Composition," and that in
his prospectus and other publications he announced that he sells
the "Ori g inal Rahtjen's Composition for Ships' Bottoms,
manufactured by the London Oil and Color Co., Limited."
This use of the name of the complainant by the defendant, the
court held, constituted an illegal act, and even if the complainants had not retained their right to the use of the words "IRahtjen's Composition," that the defendant had not acquired the
right to use the name in such a way as to cause the public to
believe that; his product was the product of lRahtjen or of his
delegates. The defendant was therefore condemned in judgment and enjoined from the use of the words in future. An
appeal was taken from this decision and the court above reversed the judgment, holding that the name "Rahtjen's Composition" had become the property of the public, which had
the right to "offer it for sale under the name generally used to
describe it, because any other name would completely mislead
the purchaser, always supposing that the public is not to be
led astray as to the individuality of the manufacturer, or as to
the source of the said products. As it is shown by the documents deposited in the present process that the varnish invented by the associate is generally known in England and in
Belgium under the name of Rahtjen's composition; so that in
the eyes of the public this name of Rahtjen has become a sort
of qualifying adjective indicative of this special product; as
the appellant has always in his sign and in his circulars been
careful to announce that the product that he sells was manufactured by the ' London Oil and Color Company, '"the court
held that the intention of bad faith which constitutes an element necessary to the establishment of breach of faith had no
actual existence, and the judgment was therefore reversed.
Complaint had also been made by Mr. John IRahtjen in the
court at Hamburg against Holzapfel and others for the wrongful use of the words "Rahtjen's Composition," and that court
held in substance that there was no longer any exclusive property in the words used, and that the defendants should, therefore, be discharged.

Opinion of the Court.

.Mr. Timothy D. 2ferwin and Mr. Thomas B. Kerr for respondent.
M .JUsTICE PECEAM, after making the above statement of
facts, delivered the opinion of the court.

We are of opinion that no valid trade-mark was proved on
the part of the iRahtjens, in connection with the paint sent by
them from Germany to their agents in the United States prior
to 1873, when they procured a patent in England for their
composition. It appears from the record that from 1870 to
1879, or late in 1878, the paint was manufactured in Germany
by Rahtjen and sent to the United States in casks or packages
marked "iRahtjen's Patent Composition Paint."
Prior to November, 1873, the article was not patented anywhere, and a description of it as a patented article had no basis
in fact, and was a false statement tending to deceive a purchaser
of the article. No right to a trade-mark which includes the
word "patent," and which describes the article as "patented"
can arise when there is and has been no patent, nor is the claim
a valid one for the other words used where it is based upon
their use in connection with that word. A symbol or label
claimed as a trade-mark, so constituted or worded as to make
or contain a distinct assertion which is false, will not be recognized, nor can any right to its exclusive use be maintained.

TFrisley Co. v. Iowa Soap Co., 104 Fed. Rep. 548.
In 1873 an English patent had been obtained, and from that
time to 1878, when the Rahtjens assigned the exclusive right
of sale in the United States to Suter, iHartmann & Co., the
words "Rahtjen's Patent Composition" were used on casks
containing the paint sent by the Rahtjens to the United States,
and must have referred to the English patent, as there was no
other, and the right to use those words depended upon the existence of the patent, although up to 1878 the article sent to the

HOLZAPFEL'S CO. v. RAHTJEN'S CO.
Opinion of the Court.

United States was manufactured in Germany. As the right to
use the word depended upon the English patent, the right to so
designate the composition fell with the expiration of that patent,
and from that time (1880) until 1883, when the trade-mark was
obtained by Suter, Htartmann & Co., there can be no claim made
of an exclusive right to designate the composition as Rahtjen's
composition, because from 1880 that right became public as a description of the article and not of the name of the manufacturer.
During its whole existence the name had been given to the article, and that was the only name by which it was possible to
describe it.
The labels used by Suter, Hartmann & Co., from the outset
of their career as sole consignees, contained the description
"Rahtjen's Patent Composition, None genuine without signature, Suter, Hartmann & Co." These labels were affixed to
the packages, and were sent to Rahtjen in Germany when he
manufactured for them, to be placed on packages, and when he
subsequently made the composition in England the labels were
sent to him there to be affixed. This way of designating the
composition was employed by Rahtjen in Germany for his own
sales, and Suter, Hartmann & Co. simply copied his method of
describing the same. How else could this article thereafter be
described? When the right to make it became public, how
else could it be sold than by the name used to describe it? And
when a person having the right to make it described the composition by its name and said it was manufactured by him, and
said it so plainly that no one seeing the label could fail to see
that the package on which it was placed was Rahtjen's composition manufactured by Holzapfel & Co., or Holzapfel's Composition Company (Limited), how can it be held that there was
any infringement of a trade-mark by employing the only terms
possible to describe the article the manufacture of which was
open to all? Of necessity when the right to manufacture became public the right to use the only word descriptive of the
article manufactured became public also.
This rule held good when at the expiration of the patent in
November, 1880, Suter, Hartmann & Co. continued to send
the paint to the United States as "Rahtjen's Patent Composi-

Opinion of the Court.

tion, Hartmann's Manufacture," because it is plain that the
name of Rahtjen had, as we have said, become descriptive of
the article itself, and was not a designation of the manufacturer.
It had been manufactured both in Germany and in England at
the same time, and that which was manufactured in England
by Hartmann Brothers or Suter, Hartmann & Co. had been distinguished from the German article by the statement that it
was "IRahtjen's Genuine Composition, Hartmann's Manufacture." If any one had desired to use this paint and had called
for it in the market, he would necessarily have been compelled
to describe it as "Rahtjen's Composition," as there was no other
name for the article, and though in England while the patent
lasted no one but the patentee or his licensees could manufacture
the article, yet the description would still have been "iRahtjen's
Composition;" but when the patent expired the exclusive right
to manufacture the article expired with it, while the name
which described it became, under the facts of this case, necessarily one of description and did not designate the manufacturers. There was no other name for the article, and in order
to obtain it a person would have to describe it by the words
"iRahtjen's Composition." The words thus became public property descriptive of the article, and the right to manufacture it
was open to all by the expiration of the English patent. After
Suter, Hartmanu & Co. obtained the trade-mark of an open
hand, originally painted red, together with the name "Rahtjen's Patent Composition," which was some time in 1883, the
paint was sent to the United States under that designation;
but the trade-mark was not obtained without the positive disclaimer by the plaintiffs of the right of exclusive use of the
words "Rahtjen's Composition," and unless they disclaimed
that exclusive right they could have obtained no trade-mark.
The registration of the trade-mark of Hartmann, La Doux &
Maecker in the United States in June, 1885, was not only subsequent to the expiration of the English patent, but also subsequent to the time when the defendant company had commenced
to manufacture the paint as "Rahtjen's Composition, Holzapfel's Manufacture," and had sent the same to the United States
under that description, at least as early as 1884. The United

ROLZAPFEL'S CO. v. RAHTJN'S CO.
Opinion of the Court.

States registered trade-mark could not, therefore, interfere with
the prior (but not exclusive) right of the defendant to the use
of those words.
The respondent company advertised and sold in the United
States the composition under the name of "Rahtjen's Composition, Hartmann's Manufacture," while the petitioner advertised
and sold its composition as "Holzapfe l ' s Rahtjen's" or "EHolzapfel's Improved Rahtjen's Composition," or ".lHolzapfel's Improved American Rahtjen's;" so it is seen there is no room for
the claim that the composition manufactured by the petitioner
purports to be manufactured by Rahtjen or Hartmann. It is a
clear cut description of the name of the article which it manufactures, and there is no pretense of deceit as to the person who
in fact manufactures it.
The trade-marks which have been spoken of, and which were
obtained in 1883 and 1884, do not cover the right to use the
name "Rahtjen" exclusively. The trade-mark obtained in
April, 1883, by Hartmann Brothers, described as the "red hand
symbol," does not purport to contain any name, while that issued to Suter, Hartmann & Co., while it contained the name
"1Rahtjen's Patent Composition," was obtained only by the disclaimer on the part of the applicants of the right to the exclusive use of those words, except as part of the combination constituting the trade-mark. Prior to the English patent, the
respondent's predecessors or assigns had no valid trade-mark
in England for the same reason the IRahtjens had acquired none
in the United States, viz., they had no right to designate the
composition as a patented article when in fact there was no patent. From 1873 to 1880, while the patent was in life, they
were entirely justified in calling it a patented article, and when
that patent expired, it seems clear they had no right to retain
the exclusive use of the only name which described the composition, and that no such right could be claimed by virtue of a
valid trade-mark antedating the patent, for there was none, assuming even that such fact, if it had existed, would have justified
the claim to the exclusive use of the descriptive words after the
patent had expired.
The judgments in the Antwerp and Hamburg courts simply

Opinion of the Court.

showed that in those countries the use of the words "1Rahtjen's
Composition" or ":Rahtjen's Patent Composition" had become
descriptive of the article itself and did not in any way designate
the persons who manufactured it; but even without those judgments, the record shows beyond question that when the English patent expired the use of the words became open to the
world as descriptive of the article itself, and to manufacture an
article under that name was a right open to the world. There
was no trade-mark in that name in the United States.
The principles involved in Singer fanufacturing Company
v. June -ManufacturingCompany, 163 U. S. 169, apply here.

It is said there is a distinction between the case at bar and the
one cited, because in the latter the patent and the trade-mark
were both domestic, while here the trade-mark is domestic and
the patent foreign. The respondent claims the right to use
these words by virtue of assignments from the Messrs. Rahtjen
and also Suter, Hlartmann & Co.in England, and also by virtue
of a domestic trade-mark which it or its predecessors had acquired from user and registration in the United States. The
rights of Suter, Hartmann & Co. to the exclusive use of these
words had been disclaimed by them in 1883, long before any
assignment of their rights to the respondent, and we do not see
why that disclaimer should be confined to England. It was a
general disclaimer of any right whatever to the exclusive use of
these words, and it was only upon the filing of that disclaimer
that they obtained the trade-mark which they did in England.
The disclaimer, however, was as broad as it could be made.
When they assigned their rights the assignment did not include
a right to an exclusive use which, in order to obtain the trademark registration, they had already disclaimed. The assignment of the Rahtjen firm could not convey the exclusive right
to the use of such words, because they had no valid trade-mark
in those words prior to 1873, and by the expiration of the English patent, in 1880, the right to that use had become public.
These various assignors, therefore, did not convey by their assignment a right to the exclusive use of the words in the United
States. The domestic trade-mark, which the respondent also
claims gives it that right, was not used until after the sale of

KNOXVILLE IRON CO. v. HARBISON.
Statement of the Case.

the composition by the petitioner in the United States under
the name of "Rahtjen's Composition, Holzapfel's Manufacture."
We think the principle which prohibits the right to the exclusive use of a name descriptive of the article after the expiration
of a patent covering its manufacture applies here.
In the manufacture and sale of the article, of course, no deceit
would be tolerated, and the article described as "Rahtjen's Composition" would, when manufactured by defendant, have to be
plainly described as its manufacture. The proof shows this
has been done, and that the article has been sold under a totally
different trade-mark from any used by respondent, and it has
been plainly and fully described as manufactured by defendant
or its assignors, the Holzapfels.
We are of the opinion that no right to the exclusive use in the
United States of the words "1? a h iyen's Composition" has
been shown by respondent, and that the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit should be reversed,
and that of the Circuit Courtfor the Southern District of
ew York afflrmed, and it is so ordered.
