Statement of the Case.

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS COMPANY AND THE STATE OF KANSAS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF XrANSAS.
No. 1. Argued November 14, 15,1899. Re.argued, January 23, 24, 1901, before a full bench.
Decided November 25, 1901.

The Statute of Kansas of March 3, 1897, entitled "An act defining what
shall constitute public stock yards, defining the duties of the person or
persons operating the same, and regulating all charges thereof, and removing restrictions in the trade of dead animals, and providing penalties
for violations of this act," is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Constitution of the United States, in that it applies only to the
Kansas City Stock Yards Company, and not to other companies or corporations engaged in like business in Kansas, and thereby denies to that
company the equal protection of the laws.

IN March, 1897, Qharles U. Cotting, a citizen of the State of
Massachusetts, filed in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of Kansas a bill of complaint against the Kansas
City Stock Yards Company, a corporation of the State of Kansas, and certain officers of that company, and Louis C. Boyle,
Attorney General of the State of Kansas. A few days later,
Francis Lee Higginson, a citizen of the State of Massachusetts,
filed a bill of complaint in the same court and against the same
parties.
These suits were subsequently ordered by the court to be consolidated, and were thereafter proceeded in as one.
The plaintiffs respectively alleged that they were stockholders
of the Kansas City Stock Yards Company, and that the suits
were brought in their own behalf and that of other stockholders
having a like interest, who might thereafter join in the prosecution thereof. The main purpose of the suits was to have declared invalid a certain act of the legislature of the State of
Kansas, approved March 3, 1897, entitled "An act defining
what shall constitute public stock yards, defining the duties of

the person or persons operating the same, and regulating all
charges thereof, and removing restrictions in the trade of dead
animals, and providing penalties for violations of this act."
A temporary restraining order was granted, and subsequently
a motion for a preliminary injunction was made. Pending that
motion the court appointed a special master, with power to take
testimony and report the same with his findings, as to all matters and things in issue upon the hearing of the preliminary
injunction prayed for. 79 Fed. Rep. 679. On August 24, 1897,
the special master filed his report. On October 4, 1897, the
motion for a preliminary injunction was heard on affidavits,
the master's report, exceptions thereto on behalf of both parties,
and arguments of counsel. The motion was refused, and the
restraining order, which had remained in force in the meantime,
was set aside. 82 Fed. Rep. 839.
A stipulation was thereupon entered into that the defendants
should forthwith file their answers to the bills; that replications
thereto should be immediately filed, and that the cases, thus put
at issue, should be heard on final hearing, upon the pleadings,
proofs, master's report and exhibits, without further testimony
from either party.
On October 28, 1897, after argument, the court dismissed the
bills of complaint. 82 Fed. Rep. 850. In the opinion of Circuit
Judge Thayer there was the following order, which was also
embodied in the final decree:
"The great importance of the questions involved in these
cases will doubtless occasion an appeal to the Supreme Court of
the United States, where they will be finally settled and determined. If, on such appeal, the Kansas statute complained of
should be adjudged invalid for any reason, and in the meantime
the statutory schedule of rates should be enforced, the stock
yards company would sustain a great and irreparable loss.
Under such circumstances, as was said in substance by the Supreme Court in Hovey v. .cDonald, 109 U. S. 150, 161, it is
the right and duty of the trial court to maintain, if possible,
the status quo pending an appeal, if the questions at issue are
involved in doubt; and equity rule 93 was enacted in recognition
of that right. The court is of opinion that the cases at bar are

of such moment and the questions at issue so balanced with
doubt, as to justify and require an exercise of the power in question. Therefore, although the bills will be dismissed, yet an
order will at the same time be entered restoring and continuing
in force the injunction which was heretofore granted for the
term of ten days, and if in the meantime an appeal shall be
taken, such injunction will be continued in force until the appeal
is heard and determined in the Supreme Court of the United
States: provided that, in addition to the ordinary appeal bond,
the Kansas City Stock Yards Company shall make and file in
this court its bond in the penal sum of $200,000, payable to the
clerk of this court and his successors in office, for the benefit
of whom it may concern, conditioned that in the event of the
decree dismissing the bills is affirmed, it will, on demand, pay
to the party or parties entitled thereto all overcharges for yarding and feeding live stock at its stock yards in Kansas City,
Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, which it may have exacted
in violation of sections 4 and 5 of the Kansas statute relative to
stock yards, approved March 3, 1897, since an injunction was
first awarded herein, to wit, on April -, 1897; and that it will
in like manner pay such overcharges, if any, as it may continue
to exact in violation of said statute during the pendency of the
appeal; said obligation to become void if the statute in question
shall be pronounced invalid by the Supreme Court." 82 Fed.
Rep. 857.
On November 4, 1897, an appeal was duly taken and allowed
to this court.
Subsequently, Louis C. Boyle's term of office as Attorney
General having expired, his successor, A. A. Godard, was substituted as a party defendant.
The act of the legislature of the State of Kansas is in the
following terms:
"SEC. 1. Any stock yards within this State, into which live
stock is received for the purpose of exposing or having the same
exposed for sale or feeding, and doing business for a compensation, and which for the preceding twelve months shall have

M .JusTicE BRFwER, after making the above statement, delivered the following opinion, and announced the conclusion
and judgment of the court.
The learned Circuit Judge, in deciding the case, appreciated
the importance of the questions involved, and although denying the relief sought by the plaintiffs, exercised his power of
continuing the restraining order until such time as these ques-

Opinion of the Court.

tions could be determined. Twice has this case been argued
before us. We have had the benefit of able arguments and
elaborate briefs of distinguished counsel. That the questions
are difficult of solution no one reading the following statement
will we think doubt.
It has been wisely and aptly said that this is a government
of laws and not of men; that there is no arbitrary power located in any individual or body of individuals; but that all in
authority are guided and limited by those provisions which the
people have, through the organic law, declared shall be the
measure and scope of all control exercised over them.
We shall not attempt to determine all the questions presented,
and yet it is fitting that we should state them, and some of the
reasons urged in support of their decision one way or the other.
The first we notice is the principal matter in respect to which
testimony was offered, which has been most largely discussed
by counsel on both sides, and that is the validity of the reduction in the charges of the stock yards company made by the
act in question. Has the State the power to legislate on this
matter, and, if so, can its legislation be upheld?
In 21! nn v. illinois, 94 U. S. 113, it was held that the State
had power to fix the maximum charges for the storing of grain
in warehouses in Chicago, the court saying (p. 126):
"Property does become clothed with a public interest when
used in a manner to make it of public consequence and affect
the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his
property to the use in which the public has an interest, he, in
effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must
submit to be controlled by the public for the common good to
the extent of the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use, but so long as he maintains the use he must submit to the control."
While there was a division of opinion in the court, yet the
doctrine thus stated received the assent of a majority of its
members and has been reaffirmed since, although accompanied
by a constant dissent. Budd v. New York, 143 U. S.517;
Brass v. Stoeser, 153 U. S. 391. See also the following cases

These decisions go beyond but are in line with those in which
was recognized the power of the State to regulate charges for
services connected with any strictly public employment, as, for
instance, in the matter of common carriage, supply of water,
gas, etc. Spring Valley Water Works v. Sohottler, 110 U. S.

Tested by the rule laid down in 3funn v. Illinois, it may be
conceded that the State has the power to make reasonable regulation of the charges for services rendered by the stock yards
company. Its stock yards are situated in one of the gateways
of commerce, and so located that they furnish important facilities to all seeking transportation of cattle. While not a common carrier, nor engaged in any distinctively public employment, it is doing a work in which the public has an interest,
and, therefore, must be considered as subject to governmental
regulation.
But to what extent may this regulation go? Is there no
limit beyond which the State may not interfere with the charges
for services either of those who are engaged in performing some
public service, or of those who, while not engaged in such service, have yet devoted their property to a use in which the pub-

Opinion of the Court.

lie has an interest? And is the extent of governmental regulation the same in both of these classes of cases?
In i'unn v. Illinois, one of the latter class, in which the
power of governmental regulation was affirmed, it was said

(p. 125):
"From this it is apparent that down to the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not supposed that
statutes regulating the use, or even the price of the use, of private property necessarily deprived an owner of his property without due process of law. Under some circumstances they may,
but not under all."
In Budd v. -Yew York it was not charged or shown that the
rates prescribed by the legislature were unreasonable, and the
only question was the power of the legislature to interfere at
all in the matter. The same is true of Brass v. Stoeser, in which
nothing was presented calling for any consideration of the test
of reasonableness, or of a limit to the legislative power.
As to those cases in which governmental regulation of charges
was in respect to parties doing some public service the followingis a r~sum6 of the decisions. In Spr-ing 7alley Water Works
v. Schottler it was said (p. 354):
"What may be done if the municipal authorities do not exercise an honest judgment, or if they fix upon a price which is
manifestly unreasonable, need not now be considered, for that
proposition is not presented by this record. The objection here
is not to any improper prices fixed by the officers, but to their
power to fix prices at all."
In Railroad Commission Cases (p. 331):
"From what has thus been said it is not to be inferred that
this power of limitation or regulation is itself without limit.
This power to regulate is not a power to destroy, and limitation
is not the equivalent of confiscation. Under pretence of regulating fares and freights the State cannot require a railroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward; neither
can it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for public use without just compensation or without due
process of law."
In Wabash Railway Co. v. Illinois nothing was said affect-

COTTING v. KANSAS crIY STOCK YARDS CO. &C. 87
Opinion of the Court.

ing the question of the extent of the power of the legislature.
In Dow v. Beidelman the quotation heretofore made from the
Railroad Commission Cases was quoted with approval. In Chicago, Afilwaukee & St. Paul By. Co. v. Mfinnesota, the same
passage was quoted, and it was added (p. 458):
"If the company is deprived of the power of charging reasonable rates for the use of its property, and such deprivation takes
place in the absence of an investigation by judicial machinery,
it is deprived of the lawful use of its property, and thus, in substance and effect, of the property itself, without due process of
law and in violation of the Constitution of the United States;
and in so far as it is thus deprived, while other persons are permitted to receive reasonable profits upon their invested capital,
the company is deprived of the equal protection of the laws."
In Chicago &-c. Railway Co. v. TFellman it was said (p. 344):
"The legislature has power to fix rates, and the extent of judicial interference is protection against unreasonable rates."
In Reagan v. Farmers'.oan & Trust Co. (p. 399):
"The equal protection of the laws which, by the Fourteenth
Amendment, no State can deny to the individual, forbids legislation, in whatever form it may be enacted, by which the property of one individual is, without compensation, wrested from
him for the benefit of another, or of the public. This, as has
been often observed, is a government of law, and not a government of men, and it must never be forgotten that under such a
government, with its constitutional limitations and guarantees,
the forms of law and the machinery of government, with all
their reach and power, must in their actual workings stop on
the hither side of the unnecessary and uncompensated taking
or destruction of any private property, legally acquired and
legally held."
And again (p. 412):
"It is unnecessary to decide, and we do not wish to be understood as laying down as an absolute rule, that in every case a
failure to produce some profit to those who have invested their
money in the building of a road is conclusive that the tariff is
unjust and unreasonable. And yet justice demands that every
one should receive some compensation for the use of his money

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

or property, if it be possible without prejudice to the rights of
others. There may be circumstances which would justify such
a tariff; there may have been extravagance and a needless expenditure of money; there may be waste in the management
of the road; enormous salaries, unjust discrimination as between individual shippers, resulting in general loss. The construction may have been at a time when material and labor
were at the highest price, so that the actual cost far exceeds
the present value; the road may have been unwisely built, in
localities where there is no sufficient business to sustain a road.
Doubtless, too, there are many other matters affecting the rights
of the community in which the road is built as well as the rights
of those who have built the road."
In St. Louis & San FranciscoBy.Co. v. Gill is this language
(p. 657):
"This court has declared, in several cases, that there is a
remedy in the courts for relief against legislation establishing
a tariff of rates which is so unreasonable as to practically destroy the value of property of companies engaged in the carrying business."
In Covington &c. Turnpike Co. v. Sandford (pp. 596-7):
"The legislature has the authority, in every case, where its
power has not been restrained by contract, to proceed upon
the ground that the public may not rightfully be required to
submit to unreasonable exactions for the use of a public highway established and maintained under legislative authority. If
a corporation cannot maintain such a highway and earn dividends for stockholders, it is a misfortune for it and them which
the Constitution does not require to be remedied by imposing
unjust burdens upon the public. So that the right of the public to use the defendant's turnpike upon payment of such tolls
as in view of the nature and value of the service rendered by
the company are reasonable is an element in the general inquiry
whether the rates established by law are unjust and unreasonable. That inquiry also involves other considerations, such, for
instance, as the reasonable cost of maintaining the road in good
condition for public use and the amount that may have been
really and necessarily invested in the enterprise. In short, each

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c.

Opinion of the Court.

case must depend upon its special facts; and when a court,
without assuming itself to prescribe rates, is required to determine whether the rates prescribed by the legislature for a corporation controlling the public highway are, as an entirety, so
unjust as to destroy the value of its property for 4li the purposes for which it was acquired, its duty is to take into consideration the interests both of the public and of the owner of the
property, together with all other circumstances that are fairly
to be considered in determining whether the legislature has,
under the guise of regulating rates, exceeded its constitutional
authority, and practically deprived the owner of property without due process of law."
In Smyth v. Ames, after an elaborate discussion of the question of rates and the power of the legislature in respect thereto,
it was said (pp. 546, 547):
"We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to
the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation
maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the
fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience
of the public. And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent
improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and
stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under
particular rates prescribed by statute and the sum required to
meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and
are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each
case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to
be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What
the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value
of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the
other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no
more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than
the services rendered by it are reasonably worth."
In San Diego Land Co. v. N~ational City (p. 757):
"The contention of the appellant inthe present case is that
in ascertaining what are just rates the court should take into
consideration the cost of its plant; the cost per annum of oper-

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

ating the plant, including interest paid on money borrowed
and reasonably necessary to be used in constructing the same;
the annual depreciation of the plant from natural causes resulting from its use; and a fair profit to the company over and
above such charges for its services in supplying the water to
consumers, either by way of interest on the money it has expended for the public use, or upon some other fair and equitable basis. Undoubtedly, all these matters ought to be taken
into consideration, and such weight be given them, when rates
are being fixed, as under all the circumstances will be just
to the company and to the public. The basis of calculation
suggested by the appellant is, however, defective in not requiring the real value of the property and the fair value in themselves of the services rendered to be taken into consideration.
What the company is entitled to demand, in order that it may
have just compensation, is a fair return upon the reasonable
value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. The property may have cost more than it ought to have
cost, and its outstanding bonds for money borrowed and which
went into the plant may be in excess of the real value of the
property. So that it cannot be said that the amount of such
bonds should in every case control the question of rates, although it may be an element in the inquiry as to what is, all
the circumstances considered, just both to the company and to
the public."
And also affirming the limits of judicial interference with
legislative action (p. '154):
"But it should also be remembered that the judiciary ought
not to interfere with the collection of rates established under
legislative sanction unless they are so plainly and palpably unreasonable as to make their enforcement equivalent to the taking
of property for public use without such compensation as under all
the circumstances is just both to the owner and to the public;
that is, judicial interference should never occur unless the case
presents, clearly and beyond all doubt, such a flagrant attack
upon the rights of property under the guise of regulations as to
compel the court to say that the rates prescribed will necessarily

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 91
Court.
Opinion of the

have the effect to deny just compensation for private property
taken for the public use."
Nothing was said in Chicago &c. By. Co. v. Tonpkyns throwing any light upon the questions heretofore referred to.
In the light of these quotations, this may be affirmed to be
the present scope of the decisions of this court in respect to the
power of the legislature in regulating rates: As to those individuals and corporations who have devoted their property to
a use in which the public has an interest, although not engaged
in a work of a confessedly public character, there has been no
further ruling than that the State may prescribe and enforce
reasonable charges. What shall be the test of reasonableness
in those charges is absolutely undisclosed.
As to parties engaged in performing a public service, while
the power to regulate has been sustained, negatively the court
has held that the legislature may not prescribe rates which, if
enforced, would amount to a confiscation of property. But it
has not held affirmatively that the legislature may enforce rates
which stop only this side of confiscation and leave the property in the hands and under the care of the owners without any
remuneration for its use. It has declared that the present value
of the property is the basis by which the test of reasonableness
is to be determined, although the actual cost is to be considered,
and that the value of the services rendered to each individual is
also to be considered. It has also ruled that the determination
of the legislature is to be presumed to be just, and must be upheld
unless it clearly appears to result in enforcing unreasonable and
unjust rates.
In this case, as heretofore indicated, a volume of testimony
has been taken, mainly upon the question of the cost and value
of the stock yards and the effect upon the income of the company by reason of the proposed reduction. This testimony was
taken before a master, with instructions to report the cost of
the stock yards, the present value of the property, the receipts
and expenditures thereof, the manner of operation, and such
other matters as might be pertinent for a determination of the
case. Stated in general terms, his findings were that the value
of the property used for stock yard purposes, including the value

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

of certain supplies of feed and materials which were on hand
December 31, 1896, is $5,388,003.25 ; that the gross income
realized by the stock yards company during the year 1896,
which was taken as representing its average gross income, was
$1,012,271.22. The total expenditures of the company for all
purposes during the same period amounted to $535,29.14-thus
indicating a net income for the year of $476,974.08. The court,
however, increased the estimate of the net income by adding to
the expenditures the sum of $113,584.65, expended in repairs
and construction, thus placing the net income at the amount of
$590,558.73. If the rates prescribed by the Kansas statute for
yarding and feeding stock had been in force during the year
1896 the income of the stock yards company would have been reduced that year $300,651.77, leaving a net income of $289,916.96.
This would have yielded a return of 5.3 per cent on the value
of property used for stock yard purposes, as fixed by the master.
Or, if the capital stock be taken, after deducting therefrom such
portion thereof which represents property not used for stock
yard purposes, the return would be 4.6 per cent.
Counsel for appellants challenge the correctness of these findings, and seek to show by a review of the testimony that no
such per cent of return on the real value of the investment
would be received by the company in case the proposed reduction is put into effect. But without stopping to enter into the
inquiry suggested by their contention, it is enough for our
present purpose to state in general the conclusions of the master and the court.
On the other hand, it is shown by the findings, approved by
the court, that the prices charged in these stock yards are no
higher, and in some respects lower, than those charged in any
other stock yards in the country, and finding 37 is"The other stock yards heretofore enumerated are operated
generally in the same manner as those at Kansas City, and
there is and was for a long time prior to March 12, 1897, active
and growing competition among their owners to attract and
secure to each the shipment of live stock from competitive territories. Kansas City is the greatest stocker and feeder market
in the world, and while Chicago exceeds it as a general market,

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 93
Opinion of the Court.

yet, because of the expense of transpdrtation from Kansas City
there, and the loss in weight by shrinkage during such transportation, the lve stock shipped to and sold at Kansas City
in 1896 realized for its owners more than $1,500,000 in excess
of the amount which would have been realized if forwarded
from Kansas City to and sold on the Chicago market."
Now, in the light of these decisions and facts, it is insisted
that the same rule as to the limit of judicial interference must
apply in cases in which a public service is distinctly intended
and rendered and in those in which without any intent of public service the owners have placed their property in such a
position that the public has an interest in its use. Obviously
there is a difference in the conditions of these cases. In the
one the owner has intentionally devoted his property to the
discharge of a public service. In the other he has placed his
property in such a position that willingly or unwillingly the
public has acquired an interest in its use. In the one he deliberately undertakes to do that which is a proper work for the
State. In the other, in pursuit of merely private gain, he has
placed his property in such a position that the public has become interested in its use. In the one it may be said that he
voluntarily accepts all the conditions of public service which
attach to like service performed by the State itself. In the
other that he submits to only those necessary interferences and
regulations which the public interests require. In the one he
expresses his willingness to do the work of the State, aware that
the State in the discharge of its public duties is not guided
solely by a question of profit. It may rightfully determine
that the particular service is of such importance to the public
that it may be conducted at a pecuniary loss, having in view a
larger general interest. At any rate, it does not perform its
services with the single idea of profit. Its thought is the general public welfare. If in such a case an individual is willing
to undertake the work of the State, may it not be urged that
he in a measure subjects himself to the same rules of action,
and that if the body which expresses the judgment of the State
believes that the particular services should be rendered without
profit he is not at liberty to complain ? While we have said

Opinion of the Court.

again and again that one 'volunteering to do such services cannot be compelled to expose his property to confiscation, that
he cannot be compelled to submit its use to such rates as do
not pay the expenses of the work, and therefore create a constantly increasing debt which ultimately works its appropriation, still is there not force in the suggestion that as the State
may do the work without profit, if he voluntarily undertakes
to act for the State he must submit to a like determination as to
the paramount interests of the public?
Again, wherever a purely public use is contemplated the State
may and generally does bestow upon the party intending such use
some of its governmental powers. It grants the right of eminent domain by which property can be taken, and taken not at
the price fixed by the owner, but at the market value. It thus
enables him to exercise the powers of the State, and exercising
those powers and doing the work of the State is it wholly unfair to rule that he must submit to the same conditions which
the State may place upon its own exercise of the same powers
and the doing of the same work? It is unnecessary in this
case to determine this question. We simply notice the arguments which are claimed to justify a difference in the rule as
to property devoted to public uses from that in respect to property used solely for purposes of private gain, and which only
by virtue of the conditions of its use becomes such as the public has an interest in.
In reference to this latter class of cases, which is alone the
subject of present inquiry, it must be noticed that the individual is not doing the work of the State. He is not using his
property in the discharge of a purely public service. He acquires from the State none of its governmental powers. His
business in all matters of purchase and sale is subject to the
ordinary conditions of the market and the freedom of contract.
ie can force no one to sell to him, he cannot prescribe the price
which he shall pay. He must deal in the market as others deal,
buying only when he can buy and at the price at which the
owner is willing to sell, and selling only when he can find a
purchaser and at the price which the latter is willing to pay.
If under such circumstances he is bound by all the conditions

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c.

95

Opinion of the Court.

of ordinary mercantile transactions he may justly claim some
of the privileges which attach to those engaged in such transactions.

And while by the decisions heretofore referred to he

cannot claim immunity from all state regulation he may rightfully say that such regulation shall not operate to deprive him
of the ordinary privileges of others engaged in mercantile
business.
Pursuing this thought, we add that the State's regulation of
his charges is not to be measured by the aggregate of his profits, determined by the volume of business, but by the question
whether any particular charge to an individual dealing with
him is, considering the service rendered, an unreasonable exaction. In other words, if he has a thousand transactions a day
and his charges in each are but a reasonable compensation for
the benefit received by the party dealing with him, such charges
do not become unreasonable because by reason of the multitude
the aggregate of his profits is large. The question is not how
much he makes out of his volume of business, but whether in
each particular transaction the charge is an unreasonable exac-.
tion for the services rendered. He has a right to do business.
He has a right to charge for each separate service that which
is reasonable compensation therefor, and the legislature may not
deny him such reasonable compensation, and may not interfere
simply because out of the multitude of his transactions the amount
of his profits is large. Such was the rule of the common law
even in respect to those engaged in a quasi public service independent of legislative action. In any action to recover for an
excessive charge, prior to all legislative action, who ever knew
of an inquiry as to the amount of the total profits of the party
making the charge? Was not the inquiry always limited to
the particular charge, and whether that charge was an unreasonable exaction for the services rendered? As said by Mr.
Justice Bradley, in Transportation Co. v. Parkersburg,107
U. S. 691, 699:
"It is also obvious that since a wharf is property and wharfage is a charge or rent for its temporary use, the question whether
the owner derives more or less revenue from it, or whether more
or less than the cost of building and maintaining it, or what dis-

Opinion of the Court.

position he makes of such revenue, can in no way concern those
who make use of the wharf and are required to pay the regular charges therefor; provided, always, that the charges are
reasonable and not exorbitant."
In Canada Southern Railway Co. v. International Bridge
Co., 8 App. Cas. '723, 731, Lord Chancellor Selborne thus expressed the decision of the House of Lords:
." It certainly appears to their Lordships that the principle
must be, when reasonableness comes in question, not what profit
it may be reasonable for a company to make, but what it is
reasonable to charge to the person who is charged. That is the
only thing he is concerned with. They do not say that the
case may not be imagined of the results to a company being so
enormously disproportionate to the money laid out upon the
undeirtaking as to make that of itself possibly some evidence
that the charge is unreasonable, with reference to the person
against whom it is charged. But that is merely imaginary.
Here we have got a perfectly reasonable scale of charges in
everything which is to be regarded as material to the person
against whom the charge is made. One of their Lordships asked
counsel at the bar to point out which of these charges were unreasonable. It was not found possible to do so. In point of
fact, every one of them seems to be, when examined with reference to the service rendered and the benefit to the person receiving that service, perfectly unexceptionable, according to any
standard of reasonableness which can be suggested. That being so, it seems to their Lordships that it would be a very extraordinary thing indeed, unless the legislature had expressly
said so, to hold that the persons using the bridge could claim a
right to take the whole accounts of the company, to dissect
their capital account, and to dissect their income account, to
allow this item and disallow that, and, after manipulating the
accounts in their own way, to ask a court to say that the persons
who have projected such an undertaking as this, who have encountered all the original risks of executing it, who are still subject to the risks which from natural and other causes every such
undertaking is subject to, and who may possibly, as in the case
alluded to by the learned judge in the court below, the case of

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c.

Opinion of the Court.

the Tay Bridge, have the whole thing swept away in a moment,
are to be regarded as making unreasonable charges, not because
it is otherwise than fair for the railway company using the
bridge to pay those charges, but because the bridge compauy
gets a dividend which is alleged to amount, at the utmost, to
15 per cent. Their Lordships can hardly characterize that argument as anything less than preposterous."
The authority of the legislature to interfere by a regulation
of rates is not an authority to destroy the principles of these decisions, but simply to enforce them. Its prescription of rates is
,primafacie evidence of their reasonableness. In other words,
it is a legislative declaration that such charges are reasonable
compensation for the services rendered, but it does not follow
therefrom that the legislature has power to reduce any reasonable charges because by reason of the volume of business done
by the party he is making more profit than others in the same
or other business. The question is always not what does he
make as the aggregate of his profits, but what is the value of
the services which he renders to the one seeking and receiving
such services. Of course, it may sometimes be, as suggested in
the opinion of Lord Chancellor Selborne, that the amount of
the aggregate profits may be a factor in considering the question of the reasonableness of the charges, but it is only one
factor, and is not that which finally determines the question of
reasonableness. Now, the controversy in the Circuit Court proceeded upon the theory that the aggregate of profits was the
pivotal fact. To that the testimony was adduced, upon it the
findings of the master were made, and in recognition of that
fact the opinion of the court was announced. Obviously, as
as we think, in all this the lines of inquiry were too narrowly
pursued.
It may be said that the conclusion of the court was directly
against the plaintiffs, and therefore was a decision against all
their contentions. It was found, however, that the charges
made by the defendant were no greater (and in many instances,
less) than those of any other stock yards in the country. Nothing is stated to outweigh the significance of that finding.
While custom is not controlling, for there may be a custom on

Opinion of the Court.

the part of all stock yards companies to make excessive charges,
yet in the absence of testimony to the contrary a customary
charge should be regarded as reasonable and rightful. In Gunning on Laws of Tolls, the author says (p. 61): "Long usage and
acquiescence in one uniform payment for toll is undoubtedly
cogent evidence that it is reasonable." In Shephard v. Payne,
12 C. B. (N. S.) 414, 433, Willes, J., said:
"A fee need not be of a fixed and ascertained, but may be
of a reasonable amount; and, exercising the power conferred
upon us by the case, to draw inferences of fact, we may conclude that, if the claim can be sustained in point of law, it was
in fact for a reasonable fee. If so, then, looking to the amount
established for similar services by other officers, and remembering what fees have been paid and received within the memory
of us all in the Courts of Westminster Hall and at the Assizes,
we think there can be little doubt that the fees in question, so
far as amount is concerned, are in fact reasonable."
In Louisville, Evansville &c. Railroad Co. v. Wilson, 119
Indiana, 352, 358, is this language:
"The law makes it the duty of every common carrier to receive and carry all goods,

.

.

.

and authorizes a reasonable

reward to be charged for the service. The amount to be paid
is, in a measure, subject to the agreement of the parties; but
when the amount is not fixed by contract, the law implies that
the carrier shall have a reasonable reward, which is to be ascertained by the amount commonly, or customarily paid for
other like services. Johnson v. .Pensacola&c. RailroadCo., 16
Florida, 623; Angell, Carriers, section 392; Lawson, Contracts
of Carriers, section 125."
Again, the findings show that the gross receipts for the year
1896 were $1,012,271.22; that the total number of stock received during the same time was 5,471,246. In other words,
the charge per capita was 18 cents and 5 mills. So that one
shipping to the stock yards one hundred head of stock was
charged $18.50 for the privileges of the yard, the attendance of
the employ~s and the feed furnished. While from these figures
alone we might not say that the charges were reasonable or unreasonable, we cannot but be impressed with the fact that the

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c.

99

Opinion of the Court.

smallness of the charge suggests no extortion. Further, as
heretofore noticed, the findings show that the establishment of
these yards has operated to secure to the shippers during a
single year $1,500,000 more than they would have realized in
case of their non-existence and a consequent shipment to Chi-

cago, the other great stock market of the country.
It is not to be wondered that the trial court, in deciding the
case, observed:
"Conceding, as we must, that the legislation complained of
was radical in its nature and effect, that it reduced the company's income about fifty per cent, and that it prevents it from
realizing on the capital invested in its plant such a per cent as
is ordinarily realized on capital invested in other mercantile
and business enterprises, still," etc.
But inasmuch as the inquiry in that court proceeded upon
lines which we have indicated were too narrow, it might well
be that if there were no other questions we ought to simply
send back the case for further investigation upon the true lines
of inquiry. There are, however, other questions which compel
notice, and one is that suggested by the seventh section in the
statute, which provides a punishment for the first offence of
not more than $100, for the second offence not less than $100
nor more than $200, for the third offence not less than $200
nor more than $500 and imprisonment in the county jail not
exceeding six months, and for each subsequent offence a fine of
not less than 81000 and imprisonment not less than six months.
The language of this section, taken in connection with the balance of the statute, is not entirely clear. The previous prescriptions of the statute are of a certain charge per head. Now,
does this section contemplate a separate offence with a separate
penalty for each excessive charge per head, or does it contemplate a single penalty for a violation of the statute in respect
to the entire number of stock received in one shipment? The
difference is significant. Taking the total number shipped to
these stock yards in the year 1896, it amounted to an average
of about 15,000 head per day. Would that in case of an excessive charge for each head mean 15,000 violations of the statute? If so, as after the third offence the fine could not be less

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

than $1000 for each offence, a single day's penalties would aggregate at least $15,000,000. While the fact is not clearly disclosed by the testimony, doubtless the shipments were made
by separate shippers in bunches all the way from 50 to 500 in
number. If the penalty attaches simply to the charge for each
shipment as a single act, the burden, though large, might not
be deemed excessive, but if it attaches to that for each particular head of stock the penalties become enormous. It may be
said that this is a penal statute, and therefore it is to be construed in favor of the delinquent, and that we have a right to
expect that the state courts will construe the penalty as not
attaching to the charge for each head of stock, but only to that
upon the separate bunches shipped by different individuals.
But is the language so clear that there is no doubt as to the
construction? Is there not enough in it to justify a construction which may be accepted by the trial courts and approved
by the Supreme Court of the State, and the construction of a
state statute by the Supreme Court of the State is in a case
like this conclusive upon us. Must the party upon whom such
a liability is threatened take the chances of the construction of
a doubtful statute? If the one construction is placed upon it,
then obviously, even accepting the largest estimate of value
placed by any witness upon the property of the company, a
single day's violation of the statute would exhaust such entire
value in satisfaction of the penalties incurred. In this feature
of the case we are brought face to face with a question which
legislation of other States is presenting. Do the laws secure to
an individual an equal protection when he is allowed to come
into court and make his claim or defence subject to the condition that upon a failure to make good that claim or defence the
penalty for such failure either appropriates all his property, or
subjects him to extravagant and unreasonable loss? Let us
make some illustrations to suggest the scope of this thought.
Suppose a law were passed that if any laboring man should
bring or defend an action and fail in his claim or defence, either
in whole or in part, he should in the one instance forfeit to the
defendant half of the amount of his claim, and in the other be
punished by a fine equal to half of the recovery against him,

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 101
Opinion of the Court.

and that such law by its terms applied only to laboring men,
would there be the slightest hesitation in holding that the
laborer was denied the equal protection of the laws? The mere
fact that the courts are open to hear his claim or defence is not
sufficient if upon him and upon him alone there is visited a substantial penalty for a failure to make good his entire claim or
defence. Take another illustration: Suppose a statute that
every corporation failing to establish its entire claim, or make
good its entire defence, should as a penalty therefor forfeit its
corporate franchise, and that no penalty of any kind except
the matter of costs was attached to like failures of other litigants, could it be said that the corporations received the equal
protection of the laws? Take still another illustration: Suppose a law which, while opening the doors of the courts to all
litigants, provided that a failure of any plaintiff or defendant
to make good his entire claim or entire defence should subject
him to a forfeiture of all his property or to some other great
penalty; then, even if, as all litigants were treated alike, it
could be said that there was equal protection of the laws, would
not such burden upon all be adjudged a denial of due process
of law? Of course, these are extreme illustrations, and they
serve only to illustrate the proposition that a statute (although
in terms opening the doors of the courts to a particular litigant)
which places upon him as a penalty for a failure to make good
his claim or defence a burden so great as to practically intimidate him from asserting that which he believes to be his rights
is, when no such penalty is inflicted upon others, tantamount
to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. It may be said
that these illustrations are not pertinent because they are of
civil actions, whereas this statute makes certain conduct by the
stock yards company a criminal offence, and simply imposes
punishment for such offence; that it is within the competency
of the legislature to prescribe the penalties for all offences,
either those existing at common law or those created by statute; and further, that although the penalties herein imposed
may be large, yet obedience to a statute like this can only be
secured by large penalties; for otherwise the company, being
wealthy and powerful, might defiantly disregard its mandates,

trusting to the manifold chances of litigation to prevent any
serious loss from disobedience. A penalty of a dollar on a
large corporation, whose assets amount to millions, would not
be very deterrent from disobedience. It is doubtless true that
the State may impose penalties such as will tend to compel
obedience to its mandates by all, individuals or corporations,
and if extreme and cumulative penalties are imposed only after
there has been a final determination of the validity of the statute, the question would be very different from that here presented. But when the legislature, in an effort to prevent any
inquiry of the validity of a particular statute, so burdens any
challenge thereof in the courts, that the party affected is necessarily constrained to submit rather than take the chances of the
penalties imposed, then it becomes a serious question whether
the party is not deprived of the equal protection of the laws.
But it is not necessary to rest our decision upon this consideration, which was not fully discussed by counsel, but pass to
a question which is of a kindred nature and in which there is
presented no matter of the doubtful construction of a statute.
The act in terms applies only to those stock yards within the
State "which for the preceding twelve months shall have had
an average daily receipt of not less than one hundred head of
cattle, or three hundred head of hogs, or three hundred head
of sheep."
It appears affirmatively from the testimony that there are
other stock yards in the State, one at Wichita and one at Jamestown, and it is stated by counsel for appellants that there are
many others scattered through the State, each doing a small
business. Neither the yard at Wichita nor that at Jamestown,
so far as the testimony shows, comes within the scope of this
act. So it may be assumed from the record that the legislature of Kansas, having regard simply to the stock yards at Kansas City and the volume of business done at those yards, passed
this act to reduce their charges. Undoubtedly, the act is general in its terms, and we may not, therefore, stop to inquire
whether it conflicts with the constitutional prohibition contained in article 2, see. 17, of the constitution of Kansas:
"SEC. 17. All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 103
Opinion of the Court.

operation throughout the State; and in all cases where a general law can be made applicable no special law shall be enacted."
It may be assumed, for the purposes of the question now to be
considered, that so far as the constitution of Kansas is concerned
its legislature may enact a law, general in its terms, and yet so
phrased as necessarily to have operation only upon a single individual or corporation, but, while making that concession, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that this act is precisely the same
in its effect as though the legislature had said in terms that the
Kansas City stock yards alone shall be subjected to its provisions. Accepting, however, the full force of the general
language in which the statute is couched, it appears that a
classification is attempted between stock yards doing a large
and those doing a small business. The express and only basis
of classification is in the amount of business done by the two
classes. As evidence that we are right in our construction, we
may refer to the brief of the learned Attorney General, inI
which he says:
"The legislature has, by this act, classified the stock yards
of the State into two classes, and has adopted the most natural
and reasonable basis for such purposes that could be used,
namely, the volume of business done. The reason for this is
obvious; the stock yards doing a large volume of business are
necessarily more of monopolies than those doing a smaller business. The public has greater interest in the business of large
stock yards than it has in the business of smaller ones.
"Another reason why the classification should be based upon
the volume of business done is, that rates which are reasonable
and proper and furnish a sufficient return upon the capital invested can very properly be made lower and different in a plant
where the volume of business is large, while in a smaller plant
doing a smaller volume of business higher rates may be necessary in order to afford adequate returns."
If the average daily receipts of a stock yard are more than
one hundred head of cattle, or more than three hundred head
of hogs, or more than three hundred head of sheep, it comes

OCTOBER TERMT, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

within the purview of this statute. If less than that amount it
is free from legislative restriction. No matter what yards it
may touch to-day or in the near or far future, the express
declaration of the statute is that stock yards doing a business
in excess of a certain amount of stock shall be subjected to this
regulation, and that all others doing less business shall be free
from its provisions. Clearly the classification is based solely
on the amount of business done and without any reference
to the character or value of the services rendered. Kindred
legislation would be found in a statute like this: requiring a
railroad company hauling ten tons or over of freight a day to
charge only a certain sum per ton, leaving to other railroad
companies hauling a less amount of freight the right to make
any reasonable charge; or, one requiring a railroad company
hauling a hundred or more passengers a day to charge only a
specified amount per mile for each, leaving those hauling ninetynine or less to make any charge which would be reasonable for
the service; or (if we may indulge in the supposition that the
legislature has a right to interfere with the freedom of private
contracts), one which would forbid a dealer in shoes and selling
more than ten pairs a day from charging more than a certain
price per pair, leaving the others selling a less number to charge
that which they deemed reasonable; or, forbidding farmers
selling more than ten bushels of wheat to charge above a specified sum per bushel, leaving to those selling a less amount the
privilege of charging and collecting whatever they and the
buyers may see fit to agree upon. In short, we come back to
the thought that the classification is one not based upon the
character or value of the services rendered but simply on the
amount of the business which the party does, and upon the
theory that although he makes a charge which everybody else
in the same business makes, and which is perfectly reasonable
so far as the value of the services rendered to the individuals
seeking them is concerned, yet if by the aggregation of business he is enabled to make large profits his charges may be cut
down.
The question thus presented is of profoundest significance,
Is it true in this country that one who by his attention to busi-

ness, by his efforts to satisfy customers, by his sagacity in discerning the probable courses of trade, and by contributing of
his means to bring trade into those lines, succeeds in building
up a large and profitable business, becomes thereby a legitimate
object of the legislative scalping knife? Having created the
facilities which the many enjoy, can the many turn around and
say, you are making too much out of those facilities, and you
must divide with us your profits? We cannot shut our eyes to
well-known facts. Kansas is an agricultural State. Its extensive and fertile prairies produce each year enormous crops of
corn and other grains. While portions of these crops are shipped
to mills to be manufactured into meal and flour, it is found by
many that there is a profit in feeding them to stock, so that the
amount of stock which is raised and fattened in Kansas is large,
and makes one of the great industries of the State. Now, shall
they whose interests are all along the line of production, having
by virtue of their numerical majority the control of legislation,
be permitted to say to one who acts as an intermediary between
transportation and sale, that while we permit no interference
with the prices which we put upon our products, nevertheless we
cut down your charges for intermediate services; and this not
because any particular charge is unreasonable, but because you
are making by the aggregate of those charges too large a sum,
and ought therefore to divide with us. The possibility of such
legislation suggests the warning words of Judge Catron, afterwards Mr. Justice Catron of this court, when in Fanzantv. Waddel, 2 Yerger, 260, 270, he said:
"Every partial or private law, which directly proposes to
destroy or affect individual rights, or does the same thing by
affording remedies leading to similar consequences, is unconstitutional and void. Were this otherwise, odious individuals and
corporate bodies would be governed by one rule, and the mass
of the community, who made the law, by another."
The Fourteenth Amendment forbids any State to "deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws." The scope of this prohibition has been frequently considered by this court.
In Ba bier'v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27, 31, it was said:

106

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
o

Opinion of the Court.

"The Fourteenth Amendment, in declaring that no State
'shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without
due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws,' undoubtedly intended not only
that there should be no arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty,
or arbitrary spoliation of property, but that equal protection
and security should be given to all under like circumstances in
the enjoyment of their personal and civil rights; that all persons should be equally entitled to pursue their happiness and
acquire and enjoy property; that they should have like access
to the courts of the country for the protection of their persons
and property, the prevention and redress of wrongs and the enforcement of contracts; that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of any one except as applied to the same
pursuits by others under like circumstances; that no greater
burdens should be laid upon one than are laid upon others in
the same calling and condition, and that in the administration
of criminal justice no different or higher punishment should be
imposed upon one than such as is prescribed to all for like offences."
And in Bell's Gap Railroadv. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232,
237:
"The provision in the Fourteenth Amendment, that no
State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws, was not intended to prevent a
State from adjusting its system of taxation in all proper and
reasonable ways. It may, if it chooses, exempt certain classes
of property from any taxation at all, such as churches, libraries
and the property of charitable institutions. It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and
may vary the rates of excise upon various products; it may tax
real estate and personal property in a different manner; it may
tax visible property only, and not tax securities for payment of
money; it may allow deductions for indebtedness, or not allow
them. All such regulations, and those of like character, so long
as they proceed within reasonable limits and general usage, are
within the discretion of the state legislature, or the people of
the State in framing their constitution. But clear and hostile

discriminations against particular persons and classes, especially
such as are of an unusual character, unknown to the practice of
our governments, might be obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition. It would, however, be impracticable and unwise to
attempt to lay down any general rule or definition on the subject that would include all cases."
In Guif, Colorado & Santa F9' Railway Co. v. Ellis, 165
U. S. 150, 159, in which was presented solely the question of

classification, we said, referring to many cases, both State and
national:
"But arbitrary selection can never be justified by calling it
classification. The equal protection demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment forbids this. iNo language is more worthy
of frequent and thoughtful consideration than these words of
Mr. Justice Matthews, speaking for this court, in Yiek Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369: ' When we consider the nature
and the theory of our institutions of government, the principles upon which they are supposed to rest, and review the history of their development, we are constrained to conclude that
they do not mean to leave room for the play and action of
purely personal and arbitrary power.' The first official action
of this nation declared the foundation of government in these
words: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.' While such declarations of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the
basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty, and
while in all cases reference must be had to the organic law of
the nation for such limits, yet the latter is but the body and
the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit,
and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in
the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. No duty rests
more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of
those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality
of rights which is the foundation of free government."
These authorities are referred to again with approval in (agoun v. Illinois T2&st & SavingsBank, 170 U. S. 283.

OCTOBER TERM1, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

But we may, perhaps, come closer to the particular statute
when we consider the decisions of the Supreme Court of Kansas, the State by whose legilature this act was passed. In The
State v. Haun, 61 Kansas, 146, there was presented for consideration a statute providing for the payment of the wages of
laborers in money, coupled with this provision in see. 4:
"SEc. 4. This act shall apply only to corporations or trusts,
or their agents, lessees or business managers, that employ ten
or more persons."
The act was held unconstitutional. After referring to an
alleged defect in the title, the court said (p. 152):
"We have no hesitation in saying that if this statute had,
without defect as to title, clearly and in express terms amended
corporate charters, retaining the section classifying corporations
to which it was applicable by the number of men in their employ, it would be obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States."
Again on pp. 153, 154:
"The obvious intent of the act is to protect the laborer and
not to benefit the corporation. Why should not the nine employ~s who work for one corporation be equally protected with
the eleven engaged in the same line of employment for another
corporation? If such law is beneficial to wage earners in the
one instance, why not in the other? The nine men lawfully paid
for their labor in goods at a truck store might with much reason
complain that the protection of the law was unequal as to them,
when they saw eleven men paid in money for the same service
performed for another corporation engaged in a like business.
Such inequality destroys the law. In the instance cited, two
of the eleven men might quit the employment of the company
for which they worked, and by this act alone make a method
of payment by the corporation lawful which was unlawful
while the eleven were employed. The criminality or innocence of an act done ought not to depend on the happening
of such a circumstance. Equal protection of the laws means
equal exemption with others of the same class from all charges
and burdens of every kind.

Opinion of the Court.

alike in organization, capital and all other powers and privileges conferred by law. It is arbitrary and wanting in reason. The act in question is class legislation of the most
pronounced character."
And in support of these views the court quoted from Cooley's
Constitutional Limitations, 5th ed. 484:, 486.
"Every one has a right to demand that he be governed by
general rules and a special statute which, without his consent,
singles his case out as one to be regulated by a different law
from that which is applied" in all similar cases, would not be
legitimate legislation, but would be such an arbitrary mandate
as is not within the province of free governments. Those who
make the laws 'are to govern by promulgated, established laws,
not to be varied in particular cases, but to have one rule for
rich and poor, for the favorite at court and the countryman at
plow.' This is a maxim in constitutional law, and by it we
may test the authority and binding force of legislative enactments."
So we have the clear declaration of the Supreme Court of
Kansas that legislation by which one individual or even one set
of individuals is selected from others doing the same business
in the same way and subjected to regulations not cast upon
them, is a discrimination forbidden by the constitutional provision which obtains both in the constitution of Kansas and in
that of the United States to the effect that the equal protection
of the laws is guaranteed to all.
May we not rightfully accept this declaration of law by the
highest tribunal of the State by whose legislature the act inquestion was passed, and, accepting the reasoning of that decision, does it not follow that, if an act which provides certain
regulations for corporations employing ten or more laborers,
and leaving corporations employing less than that number free
from such regulations is an unjust discrimination and a denial
of the equal protection of the laws, an act which imposes regulations upon corporations doing business over a certain amount
and leaving all corporations doing a like business less than that
amount free from such regulations is equally obnoxious to constitutional prohibition?

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

The significance of the question thus clearly stated and forcibly answered by the Supreme Court of Kansas cannot be overestimated. It is not the province of this or any other court to
consider its purely economic features. It may or it may not
be wise, looking at it from such standpoint, to say to every citizen that his industry, ability, activity and foresight may be
rewarded up to a certain extent and that beyond that he may
not go. But whether it is wise or unwise, is not for the courts
to determine. Their limits of inquiry are purely judicial. And
the single matter for our present consideration is whether in
the restraint which the legislature of Kansas has attempted to
impose upon this stock yards company it has trespassed upon
those rights which by the Constitution of the United States are
secured to every individual against state action. It has been
more than once said judicially that one of the principles upon
which this government was founded is that of equality of right.
It is emphasized in that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
which prohibits any State to deny to any individual the equal
protection of the laws. That constitutional provision does not,
it is true, invalidate legislation on the mere ground of inequality
in actual result. Tax laws, for instance, in their nature are
and must be general in scope, and it may often happen that in
their practical application they touch one person unequally
from another. But that inequality is something which it is
impossible to foresee and guard against, and therefore such resultant inequality in the operation of a law does not defeat its
validity. As was said in this court in -Yerc]cants' Bank v.
Pennsylvania,167 U. S. 461, 463:
"If it be said that a lack of uniformity renders the statute
obnoxious to that part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Federal Constitution which forbids a State to 'deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,'
it becomes important to see in what consists the lack of uniformity. It is not in the terms or conditions expressed in the
statute, but only in the possible results of its operation. Upon
all bank shares, whether state or national, rests the ordinary
state tax of four mills. To every bank, State and national,
and all alike, is given the privilege of discharging all tax obli-

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 111
Opinion of the Court.

gations by collecting from its stockholders and paying eight
mills on the dollar upon the par value of the stock. If a bank
has a large surplus, and its stock is in consequence worth five
or six times its par value, naturally it elects to collect and pay
the eight mills, and thus in fact it pays at a less rate on the
actual value of its property than the bank without a surplus,
and whose stock is only worth par. So it is possible, under the
operation of this law, that one bank may pay at a less rate
upon the actual value of its banking property than another;
but the banks which do not make this election, whether state
or national, pay no more than the regular tax. The result of
the election under the circumstances is simply that those electing pay less. But this lack of uniformity in the result furnishes
no ground of complaint under the Federal Constitution. Suppose, for any fair reason affecting only its internal affairs, the
State should see fit to wholly exempt certain named corporations from all taxation. Of course, the indirect result would be
that all other property might have to pay a little larger rate
per cent in order to raise the revenue necessary for the carrying on of the state government, but this would not invalidate
the tax on other property or give any right to challenge the
law as obnoxious to the provisions of the Federal Constitution."
So again exercising the undoubted right of classification it
may often happen that some classes are subjected to regulations, and some individuals are burdened with obligations which
do not rest upon other classes or other individuals not similarly
situated. License taxes are imposed on certain classes of business, while others are exempt. It would practically defeat
legislation if it was laid down as a rule that a statute was necessarily adjudged invalid if it did not bring all within its
scope or subject all to the same burdens. It would strip the
legislature of its inherent power to determine generally what
is for the general interests, which interests may often be promoted by certain regulations affecting one class which do not
affect another - certain burdens imposed on one which do not
rest upon another.
But while recognizing to the full extent the impossibility of
an imposition of duties and obligations mathematically equal

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

upon all, and also recognizing the right of classification of industries and occupations, we must nevertheless always remember that the equal protection of the laws is guaranteed, and that
such equal protection is denied when upon one of two parties
engaged in the same kind of business and under the same conditions burdens are cast which are not cast upon the other.
There can be no pretence that a stock yard which receives 99
head of cattle per day a year is not doing precisely the same
business as one receiving 101 head of cattle per day each year.
It is the same business in all its essential elements, and the only
difference is that one does more business than the other. But
the receipt of an extra two head of cattle per day does not
change the character of the business. If once the door is
opened to the affirmance of the proposition that a State may regulate one who does much business, while not regulating another
who does the same but less business, then all significance in the
guarantee of the equal protection of the laws is lost, and the
door is opened to that inequality of legislation which Mr. Justice Catron referred to in the quotation above made. This statute is not simply legislation which in its indirect results affects
different individuals or corporations differently, nor with those
in which a classification is based upon inherent differences in
the character of the business, but is a positive and direct discrimination between persons engaged in the same class of business and based simply upon the quantity of business which
each may do. If such legislation does not deny the equal
protection of the laws, we are unable to perceive what legislation would. We think therefore that the principle of the
decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas in State v. .Haun,
supra, is not only sound, but is controlling in this case, and
that the statute must be held unconstitutional, as in conflict
with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
There yet remains a question of jurisdiction. The two suits
which were consolidated were each brought by a stockholder
in behalf of himself and all other stockholders. against the corporation, its officers, and also the Attorney General of the
State of Kansas. The object of the suits was to restrain the
Attorney General from putting in force the statute, and the

COTTING v. KANSAS CITY STOCK YARDS CO. &c. 113
Opinion of the Court.

defendants from reducing the funds of the corporation, and
therefore the dividends to the stockholders, by yielding compliance to the mandates of the statute, and failing to charge reasonable rates.
Of the jurisdiction of the court over the consolidated suit as
one involving a controversy between the stockholders and the
corporation and its officers, no serious question is made. .Dodge
v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331; Hawes v. Oakland,104 U. S. 450; Poilock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429; Smyth v.
Ames, 169 U. S. 466, seem conclusive on the question. There
is no force in the suggestion that the officers of the corporation
agreed with the stockholders as to the unconstitutionality of
the statute, and that therefore the suit is a collusive one.
That was the condition in Dodge v. Woolsey, supra,and it only
emphasizes the fact that the officers were refusing to protect
the interests of the stockholders, not wantonly, it is true, but
from prudential reasons.
But the serious contention is that the court had no jurisdiction over the suit as against the Attorney General of the State,
and this on two grounds: First, because it is in effect a suit
against the State, and therefore forbidden by the Eleventh
Amendment to the Federal Constitution; and, secondly, because it is an attempt on the part of a court of equity to restrain criminal proceedings. It is contended on the other hand
that it is not a suit against the State because it does not in any
way involve its pecuniary interest, and is only an effort to prevent an officer of the State from putting in force an unconstitutional statute; that it does not attempt to interfere with
criminal proceedings, because none have been commenced and
none are pending, but involves simply a challenge of the constitutionality of the statute. It is also urged that the Attorney
General, when served with process, did not raise either defence;
did not suggest that this was in effect a suit against the State,
or thatit was an attempt to interfere with criminal proceedings;
that he pleaded several defences and went into a trial of the
merits on a motion for permanent injunction; took part in the
taking of an immense amount of testimony and in an argument
before the trial judge upon the question of the validity of the

statute, and when its validity had been adjudged, then for the
first time and as a preliminary to a final decree, to be entered
without further testimony, filed an answer containing a formal
plea that the suit was one in effect against the State. It is further contended that by the statutes of Kansas, (Comp. Laws,
Kans. 1879, p. 901, sec. 5589,) the Governor may require the
Attorney General to appear for the State in any court and
prosecute or defend therein any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the State may be a party or interested, and that
while no request from the Governor was shown the trial court
was justified, in the absence of some challenge of its jurisdiction, in assuming that such request had been given, and that it
would be grossly inequitable, after a full inquiry upon the
merits in such court and an adjudication in favor of the validity
of the statute, to permit the Attorney General by a formal plea
of jurisdiction to prevent any review of the merits in this court.
Without expressing any opinion as to the jurisdiction of the
court if it had been properly and seasonably challenged, we
think the true solution of this matter will be found in reversing
the decree upon the merits, and directing a dismissal of the suit
as to the Attorney General, without prejudice to any other suit
or action. It is, therefore,
Ordered, that the decree of the Circuit Court be reversed, and
the case remanded to that court, with instructionsto enter a
decree in favor of the ylaintiffs and againstthe corporation
and its ofieers, in accordancewith theprayerof the bills, and
also a decree dismissing the suit as to the Attorney General
of .Eansas,without yrejudice to any further suit or action.

We assent to the judgment of reversal-so far as the merits
of this case are concerned-upon the ground that the statute
of Kansas in question is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it applies
only to the Kansas City Stock Yards Company and not to

other compames or corporations engaged in like business in
Kansas, and thereby denies to that company the equal protection of the laws. Upon the question whether the statute is unconstitutional upon the further ground that, by its necessary
operation, it will deprive that company of its property without
due process of law, we deem it unnecessary to express an opinion.

DINSMORE v. SOUTHERN EXPRESS COMPANY AND
GEORGIA RAILROAD COMMISSION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.

No. 136. Argued Febuary 25,1901.-Decided November 18, 1901.
This suit was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Georgia, by citizens of New York against the Southern Express Company, a corporation of Georgia, and the Railroad Commission of that State, to prevent the company from applying any of its
moneys to meet the requirements of the War Revenue Act of June 13,
1898, in relation to adhesive stamps to be placed on bills of lading, etc.
The Circuit Court having enjoined the commission from proceedings,
appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed that
decree, and ordered the case to be dismissed. The case was then brought
to this court and submitted here on February 25,1901. On the 2d of March,
1901, an act was passed, (to take effect July 1, 1901), excluding express
companies from the operation of the War Revenue Act of 1898. Held:
(1) That no actual controversy now remains or can arise between the
parties.
(2) That as the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing the dismissal of the suit, accomplishes a result that is appropriate in view
of the act of 1901, this court need not consider the grounds upon
which the court below proceeded, nor any of the questions determined by it or by the Circuit Court, and that the judgment must
be affirmed without costs in this court.

TiE case is stated in the opinion of the court.
