simply against an insolvent corporation. In other words, instead of a claim for reimbursement against a solvent debtor he
will have what is tantamount to a judgment against a vacuum,
and this will be the experience of all who, during those many
years, purchased from the company in reliance upon the then
ruling of the dupartment.
For the reasons thus outlined I dissent from the opinion and

MOORE v. CORMODE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
No. 49. Argued October 15, 16, 1900.-Decided January 7, 1901.

Hewitt v. Schultz, ante 139, followed in regard to the construction of the
act of July 2, 1864, c. 217, to be observed in the administration of the
grant of public lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.

THIS action was commenced in the Superior Court of the State
of Washington for Garfield County. From an amended complaint filed by Moore, now plaintiff in error, it appears that on
December 12, 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company,
under authority of the act of Congress of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat.
365, c. 217, granting lands to aid in the construction of its road,
selected under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,
the northwest quarter of section 3, in township 13 north of
range 42 east, Willamette meridian, in Garfield County in the
then Territory of Washington, as indemnity and in lieu of other
specified lands excepted from its grant.
On July 2, 1895, the railroad company for a valuable consideration sold and conveyed to Moore by general warranty
deed the north half of the above descriled quarter section.
Prior to that transfer, namely, on the 17th day of July, 1890,

office at Walla Walla, Washington, a declaratory statement setting forth that the land in question had been settled on in March,
or April, 1882, by Mrs. Ora Standiford, and that she and a subsequent purchaser of her improvements had resided continuously
thereon until 1889, when the defendant purchased the improvements and moved upon the land.
Upon a hearing ordered before the land office at Walla Walla,
to determine the right of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company to the land in dispute, the register and receiver of that
office, in January, 1891, held that the settlement upon the premises by Mrs. Standiford and the occupation of the same thereafter by her and the subsequent purchasers, including the defendant, excepted the lands from the grant to the railroad company, and that therefore they were not subject to selection by
it. The selection made by the company was accordingly recommended to be cancelled.
An appeal was taken by the railroad company to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and that officer rendered
a decision on April 25, 1895, directed to the register and receiver at Walla Walla, in which he said: "I have considered
the above entitled case, involving N. W. 3, 13 N., 42 E., appeal
by the R'y Co., from your decision in favor of Cormode. The
land is within the indemnity limits of the grant to the Northern Pac. R. R. Co., and was selected by the Co. Jan. 5th, 1884,
list No. 1. Both parties appearing at the hearing held Jan. 6th,
1891, and from the testimony then taken it appears in substance
as follows: The land was settled on March or April, 1882, by
Mrs. Ora Standiford, who was qualified to enter under the homestead law. Hier settlement consisted of the erection of a frame
house 16X 18 ft., 1 story and a half high, on the land, the plowing and cultivating of three or four acres, and the digging of
a well. At that time she established her residence on the land
and remained there continuously with her family until the fall
of 1885, when she sold her improvements upon and interest in
the land to John A. Long, who occupied the land for a short
time and was succeeded by his brother, Henry W. Long, in
1888, who remained in possession until the fall of 1889, when
the present applicant, Cormode, who applied for the same under

MOORE v. CORMODE.
Statement of the Case.

preimption law in July, 1890, purchased the improvements and
moved onto the land. Since then Cormode continuously resided
upon and improved the land. It would thus appear that on
Jan. 5th, 1884, when the right of the R'y Co. attached, the land
was embraced in the bonafide settlement of a party, Mrs. Standiford, qualified to enter the same under the settlement laws.
Your decision is therefore affirmed and the Co.'s selection of
that date held for cancellation as invalid."
The decision of the Commissioner was sustained by the Secretary of the Interior on May 20, 1896.
Thereafter the defendant Cormode made final proof of his
claim, and, a final receipt having been issued to him by the
district land office, on the 2d of May, 1898, he received a patent
from the United States conveying to him the title to the land.
The plaintiff averred that the decisions of the register and
receiver of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the
Interior were made and rendered under misapprehension of law;
that the officers of the Land Department and the Secretary of
the Interior were wholly without jurisdiction to consider the
application of the defendant to make preemption entry of the
land, for the reason that the land was not at that time public
land of the United States and was not then subject to homestead
entry, but before the date of the defendant's application had
been withdrawn from entry or sale, and that the decisions allowing the defendant to enter the land were void, and the entry
made also void and of no effect; that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company under the grant by the act of July 2, 1864, became and was the owner in fee simple of the land and entitled
to a patent therefor from the United States; that the defendant's patent constituted him a trustee, holding the legal title
for the benefit of the plaintiff, and was a cloud upon the latter's
title; and that the defendant wrongfully and unlawfully withheld the possession of the premises, although the plaintiff bad
at various times demanded the same.
A demurrer to the complaint was sustained; and the plaintiff declined to plead further. Whereupon the court, on motion of the defendant, dismissed the action. That judgment
was affirmed in the Supreme Court of the State, all the mem-

bers of the court concurring in such affirmance. In its opinion
in the case that court said: "But, taking a broad view of the
question in considering the primary effect of the act [of Congress of July 2, 1864] as a matter of public policy, which is
always permissible 'where there is room for construction and
the true intent is a matter of doubt, we are of the opinion that
there was no intention to withdraw from actual settlement the
immense quantity of lands embraced within the indemnity
limits. This phase of the matter has received consideration in
a number of cases. Attention is called to the fact that it was
expected when the law was enacted that the road would be
speedily constructed, and that it would traverse, in the main,
practically unoccupied territory, and that there would be consequently no great loss of lands within the place limits. It
might well have been considered that there would be ample
-lands within the indemnity limits to make good such losses, although these lands were open to settlement at all time prior to
their actual selection. See Northern Pacific Railroadv. Msser-Sauntry 1and &~c. Co., 168 U. S. 604. And after a consideration of the numerous cases cited in the briefs we are
of the opinion that the grant did not take effect as to any lands
within the indemnity limits until actually selected by the company, and that prior thereto they were open to settlement. It
has been the long-continued policy of the Government to facilitate the settlement of its unoccupied lands, and so great a restriction as this would have been under the company's contention could hardly have been contemplated. The departmental
withdrawal was subsequently set aside and cannot operate to
extend the provisions of the act. Those parts of the discussion
or statements in some of the cases most relied upon by the ap-,
pellant are not in harmony with the later expressions of the
court, especially in Northern Pacific Railroad v. Colburn,
164 U. S. 383, and Northern Paciic Railroad v. Sanders,
166 U. S. 620. Also the prevailing and long-continued construction of the act by the Land Department is entitled to great
weight in determining the questions raised. Many patents have
been issued thereunder to settlers who are now occupying the
lands, as in this case, and doubtless frequent transfers have

been made to others who have regarded the title as perfect, for
the issuance of a patent is regarded by the common mind as
conclusive, and if it is a matter of doubt the overturning of
these rights and the construction of the Land Department should
be reserved for the highest court in the land. Furthermore it
is most strenuously insisted by the respondent that the case
must be decided in his favor on the ground that it does not appear that there was any finding by the Land Department that
there was any deficiency in place lands, and that under the familiar rule applied to judgments, if an affirmative finding that
there was no loss of place limits was necessary, then that such
finding would be presumed ; that all presumptions are in favor
of the regularity of the proceedings in the Land Department
to sustain a patent. The appellant has undertaken to conclude
this matter by averment in his complaint, and contends that
the indemnity lands were appropriated without selection by
reason of the deficiency in place limits, and that the court is
bound by the allegations of the complaint in this particular.
There is no allegation, however, that there was a finding by
the Secretary of the Interior or in the proceedings before the
Land Department that there was a deficiency in place limits.
And it seems to us that to enable the company to claim this
land there must have been a finding that there was a deficiency
within the place limits for which the lands claimed were taken,
or that it was conclusively established in the proceedings before the department. This matter was a question of fact essentially within the jurisdiction of the Land Department, and
its judgment should be sustained unless it appears that it is in
conflict with the facts therein found or established. It may
have been found that there was no deficiency entitling the company to select these lands. It was found that when the selection was made the land was occupied by a qualified settler, and
the company therefore not entitled to take it. The contention
of the appellant with reference to the allegations of the complaint in this respect are in our opinion overborne by the authorities. Jon on v. Drew, 171 U. S. 93 ; Durango Land and

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, after stating the facts as above reported,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The land in controversy is within the indemnity limits of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company as shown by its map of definite location. It was embraced by the order made by the Secretary in November, 1880, whereby the local land office was directed to withdraw and hold reserved "from sale or homestead
or other entry" all of the odd-numbered sections "within the
place and first indemnity limits" of the Northern Pacific Railroad, as indicated on its map of definite location filed in October, 1880. That order of course proceeded on the ground that
under the act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365, c. 217, it was competent for the Secretary of the Interior immediately upon the
filing and acceptance of the company's map of definite location
to withdraw from the operation of the preninption and homestead laws all the odd-numbered sections within the indemnity
limits of the road and coterminous with the line of such definite
location. The act of 1864 has been differently interpreted in the
Land Department since the decision in 1888 of Secretary Vilas in
Northern Pacific Railroadv. Miller, 7 L. D. 100. For the reasons stated in the opinion just delivered in /ewitt v. Schultz, we
accept that decision as indicating the construction of the act of
1864 to be observed in the administration of the grant of public
lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. This leads
to an affirmance of the judgment without reference to other
questions discussed at the bar.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington must be and is hereby
Affrmed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concurred in the result.
AIR. JUSTICE BREWER and MR. JUSTICE SHmlAs dissented.
