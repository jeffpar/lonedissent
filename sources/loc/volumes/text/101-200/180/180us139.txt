HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA.
No. 34. Argued October 15, 16, 1900-Decided January 7, 1901.

The controlling question in this case is whether it was competent for the
Secretary of the Interior upon receiving and approving of the map of the
definite location of the Northern Pacific Railroad to make the order of
withdrawal, stated by the court in its opinion, in respect of the oddnumbered sections of land within the indemnity limits, that is, of lands
between the forty mile and fifty mile limits. In 1888 Secretary Vilas, in
an elaborate opinion, held that the Northern Pacific act forbade the Land
Department to withdraw from the operation of the priimption and homestead laws, any lands within the indemnity limits of the grant made by
the act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365, c. 217; and that, until a valid selection by the grantee was made from the lands within the indemnity limits,
they were entirely open to disposition by the United States, or to appropriation under the laws of the United States for the disposition of the public lands. Ield, that the question could not be said to be free from doubt,
but that it was the settled doctrine of the court that in case of ambiguity
the Judicial Department will lean in favor of a construction given to a
statute by the Department charged with the execution of such statute,
and, if such construction be acted upon for a number of years, will look
with disfavor upon any sudden change, whereby parties, who have contracted with the Government upon the faith of such construction, may be
prejudiced.
If the question whether there has been deficiency in the grant of lands to
the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was at all material in this case,
no effect can be given to the certificate of Commissioner Lamoreux set
out in the findings of fact.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. J. H. MJ Gowan for plaintiff in error. Mr. James A.
Kiellogg and Mr. C. D Austin were on his brief.
Mr. C. W. Bunn and MrM.James B. Kerr for defendants in
error.

teen, township one hundred and thirty-two north of range fiftyseven west of the fifth principal meridian, situated in the county
of Sargent, North Dakota, and of which the plaintiff Hewitt,
now plaintiff in error, claimed to be the owner in fee in virtue
of a patent issued to him by the United States.
The present defendants in error, who were defendants below,
claimed title as purchasers from the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, which asserted ownership of the land in virtue of the
act of Congress of July 2, 1864, granting public lands to that
corporation to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph
line from Lake Superior to Puget Sound on the Pacific coast
by the northern route. 13 Stat. 365, c. 217.
There was a verdict and judgment in the court of original
jurisdiction in favor of the plaintiff. But that judgment was
reversed in the Supreme Court of North Dakota, and the cause
was remanded with directions to dismiss the action. 7 North
Dakota, 601.
This appeal questions the final judgment of the highest court
of North Dakota upon the ground that it denied to Hewitt
rights and privileges specially set up and claimed by him under
the laws of the United States.
The record contains a voluminous finding of facts based upon
the stipulation of the parties. In the view taken of the case
by this court many of those facts are immaterial. The precise
case to be determined is shown by the following statement,
based upon the finding of facts:
On the 30th day of March, 1872, the railroad company having by a map designated its general route from the Red River
of the North to the Missouri River in the then Territory of Dakota, an Acting Commissioner of the General Land Office transmitted to the register and receiver of the proper local office a
diagram showing such route, and in conformity with instructions from the Secretary of the Interior, directed them "to
withhold from sale or location, preemption or homestead entry
all the surveyed or unsurveyed odd-numbered sections of public
lands falling within the limits of forty miles" (the place or
granted limits) as designated on such map. This order took
effect April 22, 1872, on which day it was received at the local
land office.

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

The land in dispute is coterminous with the general route of
the railroad as indicated by the above map.
On the 11th day of June, 1873, the railroad company having
previously filed a map of the definite location of its line from
the Red River of the North to the Missouri River in Dakota
Territory, the General Land Office transmitted to the local land
office a diagram showing the forty and fifty mile limits of the
land grant along that line, and that office was directed " to
withhold from sale or entry all the odd-numbered sections, both
surveyed or unsurveyed, falling within those limits, and to hold
subject to preemption and homestead entry only the even-nuinbered sections at $2.50 per acre within the forty-mile limits,
and $1.25 per acre between the forty and fifty-mile or indemnity limits." This order was recorded at the local land office
June 24, 1873.
The land in dispute, the finding of facts states, was coterminous with such line of definite location, was more than forty
but within fifty miles of such line, that is, was within the indemnity limits, and was at the date of such location public lands
to which the United States had full title, not reserved, sold,
granted or otherwise appropriated, free from pregmption or
other claims or rights, and non-mineral in character.
It may be here observed that the controlling question in this
case is whether it was competent for the Secretary of the Interior, upon receiving and approving the map of the definite
location of the road, to make the above order of withdrawal in
respect of the odd-numbered sections of land within the indemnity limits, that is, of lands between the forty-mile and fiftymile limits. This question will be adverted to after we shall
have stated other facts material in the case.
On or about the 10th day of April, 1882-the railroad company not having at that time made or attempted to make any
selection of lands in the indemnity limits to supply losses in the
place limits-Hewitt, being qualified to acquire and hold lands
under the pre~mption laws of the United States, settled upon
and improved the lands here in dispute with the intention of
entering the same under the provisions of the act of Congress
approved September 4, 1841, 5 Stat. 453, c. 16, and the acts sup-

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

plemental thereto and amendatory thereof, authorizing the entry
and purchase of public lands by citizens of the United States
and by those who declared their intention to become citizens.
The township embracing the land in dispute was surveyed in
July, 1882, and the plat of survey was filed in the local land
office on the 13th day of October of the same year.
On the 2d day of November, 1882, Hewitt presented to the
proper United States local land office a declaratory statement
for this land, as provided by law, which was received, filed and
placed upon the records of that office.
On the 19th day of March, 1883, the railroad company filed
in the local land office a list of selections of land "in bulk" embracing the land in dispute, which, as already stated, was within
the indemnity limits of the railroad company.
Having from the day of his settlement upon the land until
April 4, 1883, resided upon and cultivated the same as required
by law, Hewitt, on the day last named, submitted his final
proofs for the land, and duly tendered to the local land office
the Government's price for it, together with all required fees.
But such final proof was rejected, the reason assigned for such
rejection being that the land had been withdrawn from entry
under the act of July 2,1864, granting lands to the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company, and the acts of Congress supplemental thereto and amendatory thereof. From that decision
Hewitt appealed to the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and on the 5th of October, 1883, that officer affirmed
the decision of the local land office.
On the 21st of June, 1884, while Hewitt was in possessionhe had been in actual possession since April 10, 1882, and had
made valuable improvements on the land-the defendant Emil
Schultz (his co-defendant being his wife) made a contract with
the railroad company, by which the latter agreed, in consideration of $1200, to sell and convey to the former the land in
dispute. Thereupon Schultz entered upon the land, ousting
Hewitt from actual possession, and taking up his residence
thereon, and cultivating the same. Schultz having paid the
above consideration, the railroad company conveyed the land
to him. But the conveyance was not made until December 18,
1889.

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

Before that conveyance was made, namely, on the 15th day
of August, 1887, the Secretary of the Interior revoked the above
order withdrawing the odd-numbered sections of the indemnity
lands from sale or entry.
Subsequently, October 12, 1887, the railroad company filed
in the local land office a list designating an amount of lands
equal to those "selected" in the list of March 19, 1883, as having been lost and excepted from the grant and within its place
lands as defined on the map of definite location.
Of the decision of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office on the 5th day of October, 1883, Hewitt had no notice
whatever until on or about August 1, 1888. On the latter day
he applied for a review by the Commissioner. That review
was had with the result that the decision of the local land office
against Hewitt was reversed and set aside, his final proofs were
admitted, and the selection by the railroad was held for cancellation.
In his opinion delivered September 25, 1888, the Commissioner said: "Said tract is within the 50-mile indemnity limit
of the withdrawal for the benefit of the Northern Pacific R. R.
Co., ordered by letter from this office, dated June 11th, 1873,
received at the local land office then at Pembina, June 24th, 1873.
The township was surveyed July 12th to 27th, 1882, and the plat
of survey was filed in your office on the 13th day of October following; the whole of said section was selected by the agent of
the railroad company March 19th, 1883, per list iNo. 6.
The final proof submitted by applicant shows that he is a native
born citizen, over 21 years of age, and a qualified pre-mptor,
July 10th, 1882; his improvements consisted of a frame house,
16X 16 feet, stable 10X 12 feet, and 20 acres of ground broken,
the value of the same being estimated at $350. This declaratory statement was presented for filing within the time prescribed by law and was accepted by your office, a receipt issuing therefor. Under the late decision of the Hon. Secretary
of the Interior in the case of the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company v. Guiford iller, 7 L. D. 100, it is held that the withdrawal of the indemnity lands for the benefit of said company
was prohibited by the sixth section of the granting act, and,

being in violation of law and without effect, was not operative
to defeat the rights of bona fide adverse claimants under the
general laws of the United States who settled on lands within
such limits prior to the time when selection by the railroad had
been made. In view of the fact that claimant established his
actual residence and had permanent improvements upon the
land prior to the Government survey or selection by the railroad company, his claim was superior thereto, and hence office
decision of October 5th, 1883, is set aside, Hewitt's final proof
admitted, and the selection by the railroad company held for
cancellation."
The next step was the filing by the railroad company on the
23d day of February, 1892, of a rearranged list of selections"tract for tract" selection-selecting the tract in dispute for
one previously selected in Wisconsin but which was lost to the
company.
The railroad company having appealed from the decision of
September 25, 1888, in favor of Hewitt, the Secretary of the
Interior by a decision rendered August 11, 1894, sustained
Hewitt's right to the land. The Secretary, addressing the Commissioner of the General Land Office, said: "I have considered
the appeal of the Northern Pacific R. R. Co., from your office
decision of September 25th, 1888, holding for cancellation its
indemnity selection of the N. E. 1, sec. 13, T. 132 N., R. 57 W.,
Fargo., North Dakota, on account of the prior claim of Fred.
Hewitt under his preemption filing upon which he has submitted proof. Your office decision is based upon the holding
that prior to selection lands within said limits are subject to
appropriation as other public lands, which is in harmony with
the recent decisions of this Department in the case of Jennie1.
Davis v. Nyorthern Pacific R. R. Co., 19 L. D. 87, and your
office decision is therefore affirmed and the company's selection
will be cancelled."
In conformity with the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, and based upon the final premption proof made by
Hewitt, a patent of the United States was issued to him on the
22d day of June, 1895.
We have seen from the above statement that upon the filing

Opinion of the Court.

and acceptance of the map of the definite location of the line of
the Northern Pacific Railroad, the Land Office withdrew from
sale or entry all the odd-numbered sections, surveyed and unsurveyed, within both the place and indemnity limits. Was it
competent for the Secretary of the Interior, immediately upon
the acceptance of the map of definite location, to include in
his withdrawal from sale or entry lands within the indemnity
limits? Was he invested with any such authority by the act of
July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365, c. 217? Did Congress intend, by
that act, to declare that when the railroad company indicated
its line of definite location the odd-numbered sections outside of
the forty-mile limit and within the fifty-mile limit, on each side
of such line, along the whole of the line thus located, should
not be subject to the pre~mption and honiestead laws until it
was finally ascertained whether the railroad company was entitled by reason of the loss of lands within the place or granted
limits to go into the indemnity limits in order to obtain lands
to meet such loss? An answer to these questions may be found
in the act of July 2, 1864, as interpreted by the Land Department for many years past. We will now advert to such of the
provisions of that act as are pertinent to the present inquiry.
By the third section of the act Congress granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company "every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, to the amount
of twenty alternate sections per mile, on each side of said railroad line, as said company may adopt, through the Territories
of the United States, and ten alternate sections of land per mile
on each side of said railroad whenever it passes through any
State, and whenever, on the line thereof, the United States have
full title, not reserved, sold, granted or otherwise appropriated,
and free from pre~mption or other claims or rights, at the time
the line of said road is definitely fixed, and a plat thereof filed
in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office;
and whenever, prior to said time, any of said sections or parts
of sections shall have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied
by homestead settlers, or preempted, or otherwise disposed of,
other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu thereof,
under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

sections, and designated by odd numbers, not more than ten
miles beyond the limits of said alternate sections: . . . Pro,vided, further, That all mineral lands be, and the same are
hereby, excluded from the operation of this act, and in lieu
thereof a like quantity of unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands, in odd-numbered sections, nearest to the line
of said road may be selected as above provided. . .
This section has been often under examination by this court,
and in repeated decisions it has been held that the act of Congress "granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company only
public lands to which the United States had full title, not reserved, sold, granted or otherwise appropriated, and free from
preemption or other claim or rights at the time its line of road
was definitely fXed, and a plat thereof filed in the office of the
Commissioner of the General Land Office "-lands that were
not, at that time, free from preemption or other claims or rights
being excluded from the grant. United States v. NSorthern
Pacific Railroad,152 U. S. 284, 296; Northern Pacific Railroad v. Sanders, 166 U. S. 620, 634, 635, and United States v.
Oregon & CaliforniaRailroad,176 U. S. 28,42, and authorities
cited in each case. The cases all speak of the granted lands as
those within the place limits.
The fourth section of the act provided: "That whenever said
'Northern Pacific Railroad Company' shall have twenty-five
consecutive miles of any portion of said railroad and telegraph
line ready for the service contemplated, the President of the
United States shall appoint three commissioners to examine the
same, and if it shall appear that twenty-five consecutive m.iles
of said road and telegraph line have been completed in a good,
substantial and workmanlike manner, as in all other respects
required by this act, the commissioners shall so report to the
President of the United States, and patents of lands, as aforesaid, shall be issued to said company, confirming to said company the right and title to said lands, situated opposite to, and
coterminous with, said completed section of said road; and, from
time to time, whenever twenty-five additional consecutive miles
shall have been constructed, completed and in readiness as aforesaid, and verified by said commissioners to the President of the

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

United States, then patents shall be issued to said company conveying the additional sections of land as aforesaid: . . .
Provided,That not more than ten sections of land per mile, as
said road shall be completed, shall be conveyed to said company
for all that part of said railroad lying east of the western
boundary of the State of Minnesota, until the whole of said railroad shall be finished and in good running order, as a first-class
railroad, from the place of beginning on Lake Superior to the
western boundary of Minnesota: Provided, also, That lands
shall not be granted under the provisions of this act on account
of any railroad, or part thereof, constructed at the date of the
passage of this act."
But so far as the present case is concerned the most material
section of the act is the sixth. That section provided: " That
the President of the United States shall cause the lands to be
surveyed for forty miles in width on both sides of the entire
line of said road, after the general route shall be fixed, and as
fast as may be required by the construction of said railroad;
and the odd sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable
to sale, or entry, or prei-amption before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided in this act; but the
provisions of the act of September, 1841, L5 Stat. 453, c. 16,1
granting pre~mption rights, and the acts amendatory thereof,
and of the act entitled ' An act to secure homesteads to actual
settlers on the public domain,' approved May 20, 1862, [12 Stat.
392, c. 75,] shall be, and the same are hereby, extended to all other
lands on the line of said road, when surveyed, excepting those
hereby granted to said company. And the reserved alternate
sections shall not be sold by the Government at a price less than
two dollars and fifty cents per acre, when offered for sale."
It is contended that, construing the third and sixth sections
together, it is clear that the words, "the odd sections of land
hereby granted" in the first part, and the words, "excepting
those hereby granted to said company," in the latter part of
the sixth section refer to the lands described in the first section
of the act-that is, to the odd-numbered sections in the place
limits which were free from pre~mption or other claims or
rights, and had not been appropriated by the United States

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

prior to the definite location of the road; that as to "all other
lands on the line of the said road, when surveyed," the act expressly declares that the provisions of the pre~mption act of
1841 and the acts amendatory thereof, and of the homestead act
of 1862, should extend to them; that Congress took pains to
declare that it did not exclude from the operation of those statutes any lands except those granted to the company in the place
limits of the road which were unappropriated when the line of
the railroad was definitely fixed; and that if at the time such line
was" definitely fixed," it appeared that any of the lands granted,
that is, lands in the place limits, had been sold, granted or otherwise appropriated, then, but not before, the company was entitled to go into the indemnity limits beyond the forty-mile and
within the fifty-mile line, and under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise, select odd-numbered
sections to the extent necessary to supply the loss in the place
limits. It is also contended that the object of the reference in
the sixth section of the Northern Pacific act to the pre~mption
and homestead acts could only have been to bring the odd-nmnbered sections in the indenmity limits within the operation of
those acts.
This construction of the act of July 2, 1864-, finds support in
legislation enacted subsequently and before the railroad company filed its map of general route. By a joint resolution approved May 31, 1870, Congress declared: "That the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company be, and hereby is, authorized .
also to locate and construct, under the provisions and with the
privileges, grants and duties provided for in its act of incorporation, its main road to some point on Puget Sound, via the valley
of the Columbia River, with the right to locate and construct
its branch from some convenient point on its main trunk line
across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound; and in the event
of there not being in any State or Territory inwhich said main
line or branch may be located, at the time of the final location
thereof, the amount of lands per mile granted by Congress to
said company, within the limits prescribed by its charter, then
said company shall be entitled, under the directions of the Secretary of the Interior, to receive so many sections of land be-

longing to the United States, and designated by odd numbers,
in such State or Territory, within ten miles on each side of said
road, beyond the limits prescribed insaid charter, as will make
up such deficiency, on said main line or branch, except mineral
and other lands as excepted in the charter of said company of
1864, to the amount of the lands that have been granted, sold,
reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre~mpted, or otherwise disposed of subsequent to the passage of the act of July '2,
1864. . . ." 16 Stat. 378.
Thus, it seems, a second indemnity limit was established into
which the company could go and obtain lands in lieu of lands
lost to it in the granted or place limits.
We do not find from the published decisions of the Land Department that the question of the power of the Secretary of
the Interior, simply upon the definite location of the Northern
Pacific Railroad, to withdraw from the operation of the preemption and homestead laws lands within the indemnity limits,
was ever distinctly presented and disposed of prior to the year
1888. It was mooted in the case of the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad Company, reported in 6 L. D. 84, 87. The third and
sixth sections of the charter of that company were the same as
the third and sixth sections, above quoted, of the charter of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company. From the opinion of
Secretary Lamar in that case, we infer that some of his predecessors had assumed that the power to withdraw lands in indemnity limits from sale or entry could be exercised upon the
definite location of the railroad even before it had been ascertained by losses in place limits that the company must look to
the indemnity limits in order to supply its grant. The Secretary said: "Were I called upon to treat as an original proposition the question as to the legal authority of the Secretary
to withdraw from the operation of the settlement laws lands
within the indemnity limits of said grant, I should at least have
such doubts of the existence of any such authority as to have
restrained me of its exercise. It would seem that the very
words of the act, 'the odd-numbered sections of land hereby
granted shall not be liable to sale or entry or preemlption before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as pro-

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

vided in this act,' of themselves indicate most clearly the legislative will that there should not be withdrawn for the benefit
of said company from sale or entry any other lands, except the
odd-numbered sections within the granted limits, as expressly
designated in the act. But when the provision following this,
in the very same sentence, is considered - 'but the provisions of
the act of September, 1841, granting preemption rights, and
the acts amendatory thereof, and of the act entitled "An act to
secure homesteads to actual settlers upon the public domain,"
approved May 20, 1862, shall be and the same are hereby extended to all other lands on the line of said road when surveyed,
excepting those hereby granted to said company '-it is difficult
to resist the conclusion that Congress intended that 'all other
lands excepting those hereby granted to said company' shall
be open to settlement under the preemption and homestead
laws, and to prohibit the exercise of any discretion in the executive in the matter of determining what lands shall or shall
not be withdrawn. Waiving all questions as to whether or not
said granting act took from the Secretary all authority to withdraw said indemnity limits from settlement, it is manifest that
the said act gave no special authority or direction to the executive to withdraw said lands; and when such withdrawal was
made it was done by virtue of the general authority over such
matters possessed by the Secretary of the Interior, and in the
exercise of his discretion; so that, were the withdrawal to be
revoked, no law would be violated, no contract broken. The
company would be placed exactly in the position which the law
gave it, and deprived of no rights acquired thereunder. It
would yet have its right to select indemnity for lost lands, but
in so doing it would have no advantage over the settler, as it
now has in contravention of the policy of the Government in
denial of the rights unquestionably conferred upon settlers by
land laws of the country, apparently specially protected by the
provisions of the granting act under consideration."
But in 1888 the question was directly presented to Secretary
Vilas in Nrthern Pacific Railroad Copany v. Miller, 7 L. D.
100, 120, (referred to in the decision of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office of September 25, 1888, upholding Hewitt's

HEWITT 7. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

claim,) and it was there held, in an elaborate opinion, that the
Northern Pacific act forbade the Land Department to withdraw from the operation of the pre~mption and homestead
laws any lands within the indemnity limits of the grant made
by the act of July 2, 1864. The Secretary said:
"In my opinion, and it is with great deference that I present
it, the granting act not only did not authorize a withdrawal of
lands in the indemnity limits, but forbade it. The difference
between lands in the granted limits, and lands in indemnity
limits, and between the time and manner in which the title of
the United States changes to and vests in the grantee, accordingly as lands are within one or the other of these limits, has
been clearly defined by the Supreme Court, and it is sufficient
to state the well settled rules upon this subject.
"As to the lands in the primary, or granted, limits: ' The
title to the alternate sections to be taken within the limits, when
all the odd sections are granted, becomes fixed, ascertained and
perfected in each case by this location of the line of road, and in
case of each road the title relates back to the act of Congress.'
St. Paul, Sioux City &c.Railroad v. Winona &e. Railroad,
112 U. S. 720, 726 ; _Missouri, Kansas &, Texas Railway v. Ziansas Pacific Railway, 97 U. S.491, 501; Van. Wyck v. Knevals,
106 U. S.360; Cedar Rapids & Missouri Railroad Co. v. Hl-erring, 110 IT. S.27; Grinnell v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S.739. As
to indemnity limits: ' The time when the right to lands becomes
vested, which are to be selected within given limits under these
land grants, whether the selection is in lieu of lands deficient
within the primary limits of the grant, or of lands which for
other reasons are to be selected within certain secondary limits,
is different in regard to those that are ascertained within the primary limits by the location of the line of the road. In Ryan
v. Railroad Co., 99 U. S. 382, this court, speaking of a contest
for lands of this class, said: " It was within the secondary or
indemnity territory where that deficiency was to be supplied.
The railroad company had not and could not have any claim
to it until specially selected, as it was for that purpose;" and
the reason given for that is that "when the road was located
and the maps were made the right of the company to the odd

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

sections first named became fixed and absolute. With respect
to the lieu lands, as they are called, the right was only a float,
and attached to no specified tracts until the selection was actually made in the manner prescribed." The same idea is suggested, though not positively affirmed, in the case of Grinnell
v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S. 739. In the case of Cedar Rapids
Railroad Co. v. [d'erring, 110 U. S. 27, this principle became
the foundation, after much consideration, of the judgment of
the court rendered at the last term. And the same principle
is announced at this term in the case of the [ansasPacificRailroad Co. v. Atchi.son, Topeka and Santa K6 Co., ante, (112 U. S.)
414. The reason for this is that, as no vested right can attach to
the lands in place--the odd-numbered sections within six miles
of each side of the road-until these sections are ascertained
and identified by a legal location of the line of the road, so in
regard to the lands to be selected within a still larger limit, their
identification cannot be known until the selection is made. It
may be a long time after the line of the road is located before
it is ascertained how many sections, or parts of sections, within
the primary limits have been lost by sale or preemption. It
may be still longer before a selection is made to supply this
loss.' St. Paid Railway v. Winona Railway Co., 112 U. S.
720, 731.
"The consequence of this difference is that until a valid selection by the grantee is made from the lands within the indemnity limits, they are entirely open to disposition by the United
States or to appropriation under the laws of the United States
for the disposition of the public lands. There is nothing to the
line bounding the indemnity limits to distinguish lands within
it from any other public lands; the only purpose of that being
to place a boundary upon the right of selection in the grantee
to make good losses sustained within granted limits. This effect has been most explicitly declared by the Supreme Court
in the case of Kansas Pacific Railroad v. Atchison, Top-eka
and Santa Ff Railroad,112 U. S. 414, and in other cases. In
that case, the court said of an order of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office similar to this, so far as applicable to indemnnity limits: ' The order of withdrawal of lands along the

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

probable lines of the defendant's road made on the 9th of March,
1863, by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, affected
no rights which without it would have been acquired to the land,
nor in any respect controlled the subsequent grant.' It also said
of the indemnity limits under discussion there: ' For what was
thus excepted from the granted limits other lands were to be
selected from adjacent lands, if any then remained, to whic/h no
other valid claim had originated. But what unappropriated
lands would thus be found and selected could not be known
before actual selection. A right to select them within certain
limits, in case of deficiency within the ten mile limit, was alone
conferred, not a right to any specific land or lands capable of
identification by any principles of law or rules of measurement.
Neither locality nor quantity is given from which such lands could
be ascertained. If, therefore, when such selection was to be made
the lands from which the deficiency was to be supplied had been
appropriated by Congress to other purposes, the right of selection became a barren right, for until selection was made the
title remained in the Government, subject to its disposal at its
pleasure.'
"It was in view of this difference and its consequences that
the language of the granting act was employed by Congress,
by which it was explicitly provided that the provisions of the
pre~mption and homestead laws 'shall be, and the same are
hereby, extended to all other lands on the line of said road,
when surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company.' If lands within the indemnity limits are to be regarded
as ' on the line of said road,' this declaration appears to me prohibitory of any withdrawal, for the benefit of this road. It
might be that such lands could be withdrawn for some other
public purpose, within executive authority to provide for, such,
for example, as to constitute a reservation for Indians. But
this language was introduced into the same section which declared the granted lands not to be liable to sale, etc., and immediately following that declaration, and in the same sentence,
so as obviously to mark the legislative intent to make clearly
distinguishable the lands beyond the granted limits as being
liable to disposition under those laws. ilaving so explicitly de-

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

lared, it was not necessary to add a prohibition upon executive
officers against withdrawal for the benefit of the road. It gave
to any person entitled under the pre~mption or homestead laws
to take any such lahds, the absolute right to acquire any proper
quantity thereof, in accordance therewith ; and this right an
executive officer could not deprive the settler of. The act as
much makes that his right, as it makes it the right of the company to take the others.
"I cannot be satisfied with the idea that this language was
so introduced in immediate qualification of and distinction upon
the words rendering lands in the granted limits 'not liable to
sale or entry' for the mere purpose of declaring I what was already enacted by general laws.' The general laws applied without this declaration, and they applied more extensively than
this would apply them, since by the general laws entries of
other kinds might, if conditions concurred, be also made. The
aim of this language was, as I am forced to read it, towards
the availability to settlement of all lands not granted. It was
a vast grant, and even as so limited, a threatening shadow to
fall on the settlement of the Northwest. Well might Congress
say, 'The lands granted you shall have, but you shall tie up no
more from the actual settler to the prevention of development.'
"It may be claimed that the words, 'all other lands on the
line of said road,' do not embrace lands within the indemnity
limits. That construction would seem still more to deny the
Commissioner's power to withdraw them; since it cannot be
supposed Congress intended him to withdraw lands not on the
line of the road. But the phrase immediately after employed
in the section-' the reserved alternate sections '-when speaking of the lands to which the double minimum price must be
attached, seems to indicate clearly that' Congress had, in the
use of the power, a more comprehensive meaning than simply
to include by it the lands of the even-numbered sections within
the granted limits.
"The Supreme Court appears to have fairly set the question
at rest in the case of United States v. Burlington &c., Railroad
Co., 98 U. S. 334, 339, where it is said of the similar point raised
in respect to the line then under consideration: ' And the land

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

was taken along such line in the sense of the statute, when
taken along the general direction or course of the road within
lines perpendicular to it at each end. The same terms are used
in the grant to the Union Pacific Company, in which the lateral
limit is twenty miles; and if a section at that distance from the
road can be said to be along its line, it is difficult to give any
other meaning than this to the language. They certainly do
not require the land to be contiguous to the road ; and if not
contiguous, it is not easy to say at what distance the land to
be selected would cease to be along its line.'
"The general rule alluded to in the opinion that lands once
properly withdrawn by executive order remain so until restored
to market by like order or by statute is not questioned. But
every such general rule yields to the will of the legislature in
a particular case; and the considerations presented are designed
to show the grounds of my opinion that the legislation is in
this case particular and exhaustive."
The same question arose in Northern Pacific Railroad v.
Daviw, 19 L. D. 87, 90, and Secretary Smith expressed his concurrence in the views announced by Secretaries Lamar and
Vilas. Referring to certain passages in the opinion of Secretary Vilas, he said: "These views alone would be sufficient, in
my judgment, to sustain the conclusion reached in this case, but
I am not left to stand upon them only, for Congress in the same
section has gone further. Not content with ordering a withdrawal, that body expressly declared a prohibition against the
making of any other withdrawal, when it said, in the next clause
of the same sentence, that the provisions of the preemption and
homestead laws ' shall be, and hereby are, extended to all other
lands on the line of the said road when surveyed excepting those
hereby granted to said company.' Here is an enactment in
which the most comprehensive language is used. Having withdrawn the granted sections, 'all other' lands within the grant,
along the line of the road, are being legislated for. It would
seem, therefore, to follow logically, when it was commanded
that the preemption and homestead laws be extended to 'all
other lands,' it was all those lands within the limits of the grant
which had not been otherwise disposed of by the act. The

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

'other' lands within the limits of the grant were the reserved
sections and the odd and even sections within the indemnity
limits, and it is clear to my mind that Congress meant all of
those lands, for ' all' other lands surely cannot mean only a portion of the other lands. Qai omne dicit, niliil exclttdit is a
maxim well recognized in the construction of statutes and is
applicable here. This aspect of the case is presented and fully
discussed by Mr. Secretary Vilas in the Gnilford X iller case,
and concurring in his reasoning, it is not necessary that there
should be further elaboration of the argument. The views which
I have herein expressed were entertained also by Mr. Secretary
Lamar, and are clearly and tersely stated by him in his opinion,
before quoted from, in the case of the Atlantic and Pacifc
Railroad,in 6 L. D. p. 87."
It was admitted at the hearing that the construction of the
Northern Pacific act of 1864 announced by Secretary Vilas had
been adhered to in the administration of the public lands by the
Land Department. We are now asked to overthrow that construction by holding that it was competent for the Land Department, immediately upon the definite location of the line of
the railroad, to withdraw from the settlement laws all the oddnumbered sections within the indemnity limits as defined by the
act of Congress. If this were done it is to be apprehended that
great if not endless confusion would ensue in the administration
of the public lands, and that the rights of a vast number of people who have acquired homes under the preihmption and homestead laws, in reliance upon the ruling of Secretary Vilas and
his successors in office, would be destroyed. Of course, if the
ruling of that office was plainly erroneous, it would be the duty
of the court to give effect to the will of Congress ; for it is the
settled doctrine of this court that the practice of a department
in the execution of a statute is material only when doubt exists
as to its true construction.
But without considering the matter as if it were for the first
time presented, it is sufficient to say that the question before us
cannot be said to be free from doubt. The intention of Congress has not been so clearly expressed as to exclude construction or argument in support of the view taken by Secretaries

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

Lamar, Vilas and Smith, and upon which the Land Department
has acted since 1888. "It is the settled doctrine of this court,"
as was said in United States v. Alabama Great Southern Railroad, 142 U. S. 615, 621, "that, in case of ambiguity, the judicial department will lean in favor of a construction given to a
statute by the department charged with the execution of such
statute, and, if such construction be acted upon for a number
of years, will look with disfavor upon any sudden change,
whereby parties who have contracted with the Government
upon the faith of such construction may be prejudiced." These
observations apply to the case now before us, and lead to the
conclusion that if the practice in the Land Department could
with reason be held to have been wrong, it cannot be said to
have been so plainly or palpably wrong as to justify the court,
after the lapse of so many years, in adjudging that it had misconstrued the act of July 2, 1864. The order of withdrawal
by the Secretary of the Interior, upon which the title of the
railroad company depends, being out of the way, there is no
legal ground to question the title of the plaintiff to the land in
dispute.
It is appropriate to refer to one other matter. It appears
from the finding of facts that Mr. Lamoreux, when Commissioner of the General Land Office, issued a certificate, dated
May 2, 1896, in which it was stated: "I have caused examination to be made of the records of this office relative to the grant
to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company under acts of Congress approved July 2, 1864, and May 31, 1870, and certify
that said records show that the total area of lands excepted
from and lost to said grant within its primary limits amounts
to 10,624,746.27 acres, and that there are within the first indemnity limits not to exceed 7,065,523.49 acres which are, or
will be when surveyed, available for selection to satisfy the
losses above referred to, thus leaving a known deficiency of
3,559,222.78 acres in said grant which cannot be satisfied from
the limits as now recognized by this office."
It does not appear from the finding of facts that this certificate was given in any proceeding pending between parties in
the Land Department. On the contrary, the Commissioner of

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

the General Land Office in a supplemental report for the year
1899 referred to the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, and said: "In view of the large quantities of unsurveyed lands within the grant, and of the uncertainty of their
availability for use in the satisfaction of it; of the litigation
pending involving lands within the conflicting limits aforesaid
and the true eastern terminus of the grant, and considering the
proceedings now in progress under the act of July 1, 1898, and
the right of selection for lands within the Mount Ranier forest
reserve under the act of March 2,1899, and the prospect of the
creation of other forest reserves within the limits of the grant,
I am of opinion that it cannot at this time be stated with any
degree of certainty that there are or are not sufficient lands
available to satisfy the Northern Pacific grant under the act of
1864." Besides, in Northern PacificRailroadCo., 25 L. D. 511,
and in Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Streib, 26 L. D. 589, it
was found that there never had been any ascertained deficiency
in the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. In
the above case in 26 L. D. the Secretary of the Interior, refering to the certificate of Commissioner Lamoreux, said: "Relative to the certification of a deficiency in the grant to this
company [the Northern Pacific] made by your predecessor, it
is sufficient to say that this department has never given recognition to that certificate, nor has the company been relieved
from the specification of losses in making indemnity selections
on account of an ascertained deficiency in the grant." So that
if the question whether there has been deficiency in the grant
of lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was at all
material in the present case, no effect can be given to the certificate of Commissioner Lamoreux set out in the findings of
fact.
In our opinion the plaintiff flewitt was entitled to a judgment upon the facts found; and the judgment of the Su-preme Court of the State reversing the judgment of the
court of original jurisdiction and directing the dismissal
of the action is itself reversed, and the cause is remanded

for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment just announced, and will state briefly the ground for my dissent.
From the beginning of land grants the Land Department has
exercised the power of withdrawing from pre~mption and homestead entry any body of lands which in its judgment might be
necessary for the satisfaction of the grant. And the existence
of this power has been affirmed by this court in many cases,
and without a single exception up to the present decision. The
grant for the improvement of the Des Moines River terminated,
as finally decided, at the Raccoon Fork of that river, about half
way between the northern and southern boundary of the State
of Iowa, yet a withdrawal of lands along that river above that
fork, and up to the northern boundary of the State, was sustained. Wolcott v. Des Joines Company, 5 Wall. 681; Wolsey
v. C]iapman, 101 U. S. 755. It was held that as the extent of
the grant was doubtful, it was within the power of the Land Department and also proper for it to withdraw from settlement
and sale all lands that might under any construction of the grant
be needed to satisfy it. See among other cases sustaining this
power of withdrawal: Homestead Company v. Valley Railroad,
17 Wall. 153 ; Williams v. Baker, 17 Wall. 144; Dubuque &
Sioux City Railroad v. Des Moines Valley Railroad, 109 U. S.
329, 332, 333; Bullard v. Des ioines Railroad,122 U. S. 167,

It is to be assumed that when Congress makes a grant of a
certain number of sections per mile it intends that its grantee
shall obtain that number of sections. And when it provides
that, if there be not within the place limits the requisite num-

ber of sections free from homestead or preemption entry, the
grantee may go into an indemnity limit and select enough to
complete the full amount of the grant, its purpose is that within this territory added for selection the grantee shall receive a
full equivalent for the deficiencies in the place limits. Action
by the administrative department which tends to accomplish
this purpose is, to say the least, not inconsistent with justice.
And in order that it be not defeated it is certainly not unreasonable to temporarily withdraw from private entry a sufficient
body of land within such indemnity limits.
That in the actual administration of the Northern Pacific land
grant such withdrawals of land within the indemnity limits were
proper is clear from the certificate of the Commissioner of the
General Land Ofice, of date May 2, 1896, and in evidence in
this case, to the effect that there is a known deficiency of
3,559,222 acres of the grant which cannot be satisfied from the
limits recognized in the department. As this certificate was the
only evidence in the case and was incorporated by the trial
court into its findings of fact, it would seem that our inquiry in
this direction should be limited thereby. But in the opinion of
the majority there is a reference to a report of the Land Department, made a year after the decision in this case, and to two
opinions of the Secretary of the Interior, announced about the
time of the decision. In these some question is made of the
accuracy of this certificate. It will be noticed that in neither
report nor opinions is the fact of a deficiency denied, but only
a suggestion as to the amount thereof. It is, of course, not a
pleasant fact that by reason of the change in the ruling and
practice of the Land Department the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company fails to receive the full measure of its grant, and I do
not wonder at any effort to discredit the fact or minimize the
amount of such loss, but I submit that in the disposition of this
case we ought to be guided by the evidence before us and not
be misled by recent speculations of the department concerning
what may yet be developed.
Much is said about the vastness of this land grant, but it must
be remembered that it was a grant of lands within what was
then a wilderness. Though it was made in 1864, nothing was

and SHIRAS, dissenting.

done towards the building of the road until more than six years
afterwards. Capital finds little temptation in a promise, no
matter how great, of lands in an unknown wilderness.
The Land Department, believing that the power so constantly
exercised by it and so frequently sustained by this court still
continued, made orders of withdrawal as from time to time the
maps of the line of definite location were filed and approved.
Indeed, the question of power in respect to this very Northern
Pacific grant was distinctly presented to Secretary Teller on
May 17, 1883, and affirmed by him in a letter of instructions to
the Commissioner of the General Land Office. 2 L. D. 511.
See also Same 506. These withdrawals prior to the ruling hereafter noticed were over forty in number, and included substantially all the odd-numbered sections within the ten-mile
indemnity limit from one end of the road to the other. They
continued with unbroken regularity until the ruling referred to.
The first section of constructed road of twenty-five miles in
length was accepted by the President on January 6, 1873, as
having been finished on October 18, 1872. The last section of
constructed road was accepted on July 10, 1888, as having been
finished on June 11, 1888. During these years of construction,
and of course as inducement to the company to continue the
work undertaken, these various withdrawals were made. Not
until 1887 was there any question of their validity. The first
intimation appears in an opinion announced by Mr. Justice
Lamar (then Secretary of the Interior) on August 13, 1887,
(6 L. D. 84, 87,) in which he said:
"Were I called upon to treat as an original proposition the
question as to the legal authority of the Secretary to withdraw
from the operation of the settlement laws lands within the
indemnity limits of said grants, I should, at least, have such
doubts of the existence of any such authority as to have restrained me of its exercise. It would seem that the very words
of the act, ' the odd-numnbered sections of land hereby granted
shall not be liable to sale, or entry, or preomption before or
after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided
in this act,' of themselves indicate most clearly the legislative
will that there should not be withdrawn for the benefit of said
VOL. CLXXX-11

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
JUSTICES BREWER and SHIRAS, dissenting.

company from sale or entry any other lands, except the oddnumbered sections within the granted limits, as expressly designated in the act. But when the provision following this, in
the very same sentence, is considered-' but the provisions of
the act of September, 1841, granting preimption rights, and
the acts amendatory thereof,' and of the act entitled 'An act
to secure homesteads to actual settlers upon the public domain,'
approved May 20, 1862, 'shall be, and the same are hereby,
extended to all other lands on the line of said road when surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company '-it is
difficult to resist the conclusion that Congress intended that
'all other lands, excepting those hereby granted to said company,' shall be open to settlement under the preemption and
homestead laws, and to prohibit the exercise of any discretion
in the executive in the matter of determining what lands shall
or shall not be withdrawn."
Following this opinion Secretary Lamar revoked the orders
of withdrawal theretofore made in behalf of some twenty-four
corporations, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company among
the number. Such revocation was undoubtedly legal, for the
power which could order a withdrawal could revoke such order
whenever in its judgment the appropriate time therefor had
arrived. But such revocation did not disturb the rights which
had become vested during the continuance of the orders of withdrawal. Thus consistency in the rulings and practice of the
department was preserved.
Subsequently the question was presented to Secretary Vilas,
who on August 2, 1888, in the case of the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company v. Miller, 7 L. D. 100, ruled that all these
withdrawals were void, thus upsetting that which had been
done in the administration of this grant from the time of its
inception.
It is unfortunate that during the years of construction, when
it seemed important to hold out every inducement to the company to continue its work, the ruling and practice of the Land
Department should have been unvarying in the line of securing
to it the full amount of its grant, and that as soon as the road
was completed and no further inducement to action by the com-

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
JUSTICES BREWER and SHfRAS, dissenting.

pany was needed the ruling of the Land Department should be
changed, and that theretofore done with a view of securing to
it the full amount of its grant be declared void. A change in
the ruling of the department at that time was inauspicious.
Reference is made in the opinion to the duty of following in
doubtful cases the construction placed by the Land Department.
I fully agree with this, and I think it is a duty as incumbent
upon the department as on the courts, and that when a construction has been once established in respect to a particular
matter it should be followed by the department, unless plainly
wrong; and that this court, when the question is presented,
should hold to the original construction, especially if it be one
which obtained during a score of years, and during all the time
that the company was engaged in doing the work for which
the grant was made, and should refuse to uphold a change made
after that work was completed, and which has the effect of unsettling and destroying the rights of many created in reliance
upon that construction.
Was the power of withdrawal rightfully exercised by the
Land Department? It is not pretended that the Northern Pacific act contains any express denial or taking away of such
power. The conclusion that it was taken away rests upon a
mere implication, but it is familiar law that repeals by implication
are not favored. If the old law and the new are consistent, and
can with any reasonable interpretation of the latter be both
enforced, they will be; and I respectfully submit that the same
rule obtains as to powers belonging to and exercised by a department.
Was there any implied denial of this power to the Land Department? Section 6 of the granting act of July 2, 1864, c. 207,
is relied upon by Secretary Vilas and by this court. I quote
the section, 13 Stat. 369 :
"That the President of the United States shall cause the lands
to be surveyed for forty miles in width on both sides of the entire line of said road, after the general route shall be fixed, and
as fast as may be required by the construction of said railroad;
and the odd sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable
to sale, or entry, or preimption before or after they are sur-

veyed, except by said company, as provided in this act; but the
provisions of the act of September, eighteen hundred and fortyone, granting pre~mption rights, and the acts amendatory
thereof, and of the act entitled ' An act to secure homesteads to
actual settlers on the public domain,' approved May twenty,
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, shall be, and the same are
hereby, extended to all other lands on the line of said road, when
surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company.
And the reserved alternate sections shall not be sold by the government at a price less than two dollars and fifty cents per acre,
when offered for sale."
Now, confessedly, every part of this section, except the clause
commencing "but the provisions," and ending "to said company," applies solely to lands within the place limits, and has
no reference or application to lands within the indemnity limits.
By its connection, therefore, the natural application of this
clause would be to lands within like limits. This natural application is enforced by the words "when surveyed," near the close
of the clause, for there is an express provision (as appears in the
first of the section) for a survey of the place limits, and there is
no reference in the entire body of the act to any other survey.
Further, the clause was seemingly necessary to secure beyond
question to preemptors and those seeking homesteads a full and
continuous right to the even-numbered sections within the place
limits. The pre~mption law of September 4, 184:1, 5 Stat. 456,
defining the classes of lands to which preemption rights should
not extend, included therein the following:
"No sections of land reserved to the United States alternate
to other sections granted to any of the States for the construction of any canal, railroad or other public improvement."
The act of March 3, 1853, 10 Stat. 244, which extended the
preimption right to the alternate reserved sections, contained
this provision :
"1Provided,That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of
this act, who has not settled and improved, or shall not settle
and improve, such lands prior to the final allotment of the alternate sections to such railroads by the General Land Office."
The exact scope of this limitation as applied to grants directly

HEWITT v. SCHULTZ.
JUSTICES BREWER and SHIRAS, dissenting.

to railroad companies may not be entirely clear. Perhaps the
limitation began with the approval of the map of definite location which, as frequently held, determines the time at which
the right of the company to the odd-numbered sections is established, or perhaps, at least in cases where the grant was to a
State instead of directly to a company, at the date of the official
certification to the State of the list of allotted lands. Such at
least seems to have been the opinion of the Land Office, as shown
by the rules announced. 1 Lester, 509. Be that as it may,
some limitation was prescribed, and this clause was unquestionably introduced in order to remove all doubt as to the full and
continuous right of pregmption in respect to the alternate reserved sections. The same provision was found in several land
grants, as, for instance, that to the California and Oregon Railroad Company, July 25, 1866, 14 Stat. 239, c. 242 ; that to the
Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, July 27, 1866, 14 Stat.
292, c. 278; that to the Stockton and Copperopolis Railroad
Company, March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 548, c. 189; that to the Oregon
Central Railroad Company, May 4, 1870, 16 Stat. 94, c. 69; that
to the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company, March 3, 1871, 16
Stat. 573, c. 122. That it did not apply to lands outside the place
and within the indemnity limits is made clear by the fact that
the provision was introduced into an act in which there were no
indemnity limits, to wit, the act of July 13, 1866, granting lands
to the Placerville and Sacramento Valley Railroad Company,
14 Stat. 94, c. 182.
Reference is made in the opinion of Secretary Vilas, approved
by this court, to United States v. Burlington & Missouri River
Railroad Company, 98 U. S.334, as indicative that the words
Con the line of said road " necessarily extend to lands within
the indemnity limits. But that case justifies no such inference.
There were no place or indemnity limits in terms prescribed.
There was simply a grant of ten alternate sections per mile on
each side of the road "on the line thereof." When the right
of the company attached it was found that the full complement
of the grant could not be satisfied by the ten successive alternate
sections, and on application of the company patents were issued to it for certain lands beyond the limits of those sections,

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
JUSTICES BREWER and SIRAS, dissenting.

and the court held on a bill to set aside these patents that the
action of the Land Department was justified in that the full
amount of the grant was intended and that there were no prescribed limits within which the grant must be satisfied. It was
said (p. 340) that the words "do not require the lands to be
contiguous to the road; and if not contiguous, it is not easy to
say at what distance the land to be selected would cease to be
along its line;" and again, ' and the land was taken along such
line in the sense of the statute, when taken along the general
direction or course of the road within lines perpendicular to it
at each end."
It is also suggested that to disturb this decision of the Land
Department in 1888 might work confusion in the administration of the grant and entail hardship on many who have acted
in reliance upon that ruling. I concede the hardship. Every
change in the ruling of the Land Department in the administration of a grant will almost inevitably work hardship upon
some, but it is well to note the comparative hardships, and no
better illustration can be presented than the case at bar; and
this irrespective of the loss by the company of a large portion
of its promised lands. The plaintiff in error immediately upon
his application for an entry of the tract in controversy was notified that it was withdrawn. le could then easily have changed
his settlement to an even-numbered section and perfected his
title thereto. le persevered, however, in his application, and
was finally allowed pre~mption, paid his money and received
his patent. If that action were now adjudged void he would
have a claim for the money paid and a claim against a solvent
debtor. Rev. Stat. sec. 2362. On the other hand, the defendant in error, who purchased from the railroad company in reliance upon the then ruling of the department, paid to the company the sun of twelve hundred dollars, and has placed upon
