KELLEY v. MILAN.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
No. 206.

Argued April 4, 5, 1888.-

Decided April 23, 1888.

In this case certain negotiable bonds, issued by the town of Milan, Tennessee, were held to have been issued without lawful authority.
A municipal corporation, in order to exercise the power of becoming a
stockholder in a railroad corporation, must have such power expressly
conferred by a grant from the legislature; and even such power does
not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the
subscription, unless the latter power is expressly, or by reasonable implication, conferred by statute.
Certain provisions of the statutes of Tennessee considered and held not to
confer power on the town of Milan to issue the bonds in question.
In a suit in chancery, brought by the town authorities to have the bonds
declared invalid, a decree had been entered declaring them valid, on a
consent to that effect signed by the mayor of the town: Held, that the
consent of the mayor could give no greater validity to the bonds than
they before had, and that the decree was not an adjudication of the
question of such validity.

THIS was an action at law, brought in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Western District of Tennessee, by
Albert Kelley and Lawrence D. Alexander, co-partners under
the firm name of Kelley & Alexander, citizens of New York,
against the mayor and aldermen of Milan, a municipal corporation organized under the laws of Tennessee, to recover the
sum of $5040, being the amount of 144 coupons, for $35 each,
cut from twelve bonds purporting to have been issued by the
defendant, bearing date July 1, 1873, each for the payment of
the sum of $1000, payable to or bearer, on the 1st of
July, 1893, 24 of which coupons matured on the 1st of July,
1876, 24 on the 1st of July, 1877, 24: on the 1st of July, 1878,

24 on the 1st of July, 1879, 24 on the 1st of July, 1880, 24 on
the 1st of July, 1881. Interest was claimed on each coupon
from its maturity.
Each of the bonds was in the following form, all being alike
except as to the numbers:
"No. 1.
State of Tennessee, Town of Milan.
$1000.
"Be it known that the Town of Milan, by its mayor and
aldermen, in consideration of the location of the Mississippi
Central Railroad by said town, the citizens thereof, in pursuance of the laws of Tennessee authorizing the same, having
agreed to issue bonds, payable on twenty years' time, to the
amount of twelve thousand dollars, with annual interest at
seven per cent, with coupons attached, in bonds of one thousand dollars each;
"And whereas the people of Milan voted the same by a,
majority and in the form required by law, the vote being in
pursuance of due notice, and in all respects according to the
laws of Tennessee, said bonds to be payable to the Mississippi
Central Railroad, under lease and control of the Southern
IRailroad Association:
" Now, be it known, that the Town of Milan, by its mayor
and aldermen, in pursuance of the authority given by the people thereof, and in obedience to the duty required of them,
issues and delivers this bond, being one of twelve; and said
Town of Milan hereby acknowledges itself to owe and be indebted to or bearer, in the sum of one thousand dollars,
which sum said Town of Milan binds itself to pay, in lawful
money of the United States, to the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, or to the order of the Southern Railroad Association, or bearer, in the city of New York, on or before
the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and ninety-three, with interest at the rate of
seven per cent per annum, payable annually on the first day
of July of each year, on presentation of the proper coupons,
hereto annexed.

hereby pledges the legal responsibility and the faith of said

town for the payment of said coupons and bond according to
the terms and effect hereof.

"Aayor of the Town of .Milan."
The declaration alleged that the twelve bonds constituted
the entire number of the issue by the defendant, and that the
plaintiffs owned the bonds and coupons, by the purchase of
them in good faith. The defendant, for plea, averred that it
did not make the bonds or the coupons, nor was any person
authorized to make the same for it, and that the coupons were
not its act and deed. The plaintiffs, for replication to the
plea, averred that theretofore, in the Chancery Court for the
county of Gibson, in Tennessee, the defendant instituted suit
against the payee of the bonds, and certain other persons,
holders thereof, by filing its bill in said Chancery Court
against the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, H. S.
.1cComb, and others, alleging that the bonds were invalid, and
praying to have the same so adjudged, and to be surrendered
to the defendant and cancelled; that thereafter, in January,
1875, in said Chancery Court, a final decree was rendered
adjudging that the bonds and coupons were valid obligations
against the Town of Milan; and that, therefore, the matter
was r'es adjudicata. The defendant put in a rejoinder to the
replication, averring that the decree referred to was procured
by combination and fraud between the vice-president of the
New Orleans, St. Louis, and Chicago Railroad Company, and
the agents and attorneys of the defendant, by which a decision
of the court in the cause, upon the matters involved, was prevented, and the decree was consented to for the purpose of
giving it effect as res adjudlcata,upon points in litigation not
honestly contested; that the decree was not the judgment of
the court on the issues involved, but was founded upon' the
unauthorized consent of certain agents and attorneys of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

defendant, who had no power to give such consent or to bind
the defendant in the premises; that the court had no power
to bind the defendant by the decree; that the decree was not
rendered in favor of a party to the record, but in the interest
of a stranger thereto; and that the plaintiffs were not bona
fide holders, without notice, of the bonds or the coupons. The
plaintiffs demurred to the rejoinder, alleging various causes of
demurrer. The demurrer was overruled, and the plaintiffs
then took issue upon the rejoinder.
The case was then tried by the court, on due waiver in writing of a jury. At the trial, the coupons sued on, and the
bonds from which they were .detached, were offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, the genuineness of the signatures being
admitted. Each coupon was in the following form:
"Town of _filan. '

"$35. Warrant for thirty-five dollars, being for six months'
interest payable on the first day of July, 1880, in the city of
New York, on bond No.-.
"A. JoDAT,
".t (ayorof the Town of .Xilan, Tenn."

The defendant objected to the admissibility of the coupons
and, bonds, on the ground that they were signed, sealed, and
delivered by the constituted authorities of Milan without any
legislative power having been given to them, or to the defendant or its agents, to sign, seal, deliver, or issue the coupons or
the bonds. The court, being of opinion that such objection
was well taken, sustained it and excluded the coupons and the
bonds, and the plaintiffs excepted.
There was a stipulation of facts made by the parties, which
is set forth in the bill of exceptions, stipulating (1) that the
bonds in question were issued by the defendant in payment of
a stock subscription made by it to the Mississippi Central
Railroad Company, the subscription being for the sum of
$12,000; (2) that, at the time of making the subscription, the
railroad company was about to extend its line from Jackson,
Tefinessee, to Cairo, Illinois, and the subscription was to aid
in making such extension and to secure its location through

Statement of the Case.

the defendant's town; (3) that such extension was completed in
1873, the same running through the town limits of the defendant, as is stipulated for, and the extension had been operated ever since that time.
The following facts also appeared by the stipulation: on the
10th of July, 1874, A. Jordan and six other persons, residents
and taxpayers of the town, instituted proceedings in the Chancery Court at Humboldt, in Gibson County, Tennessee, against
the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, and others, for the,
purpose of avoiding the liability of the town upon the bonds, the
complainants constituting the board of mayor and aldermen of
the town. The bill alleged, that, in the record of proceedings
of the board, of the date of May 11, 1872, there was the following entry: "The board was convened by order of the
mayor. Present: A. Jordan, mayor; W. M. McCall, M. B.
Harris, J. H. Dickinson, J. M. Douglas, W. E. Reeves, W. H.
Algea, aldermen. On motion, it was ordered that 12 bonds
of $1000 each, with coupons attached, payable 20 years after
issuance, bearing interest at 7 per cent. per annum, be issued
by the corporation of the Town of Milan, Tenn., to the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, upon the following conditions, namely: That the Mississippi Central Railroad Company be extended from Jackson, Tenn., to the Town of Milan,
and intersect or cross the Memphis and Louisville railroad at
the point agreed upon by Col. Read, chief engineer of the
Mississippi Ceiltral railroad, and the committee on behalf of
the corporate authorities of the Town of Milan, near S. P.
Clark's residence, the interest on said bonds to be paid annually, and that the town marshal open and hold an election 6n
the 12th day of June, 1872, within the corporate limits of said
town, for a ratification or rejection of said proposition;" that,
in such record, were entered the following proceedings as
having taken place at a meeting of said board on the 17th of
June, 1872: "The board met pursuant to adjournment. Present: A. Jordan, mayor; W. . McCall, I. B. Harris, J. M.
Douglas, W. H. Algea, and W. E. Reeves, aldermen. The
minutes of the former meeting were then read and adopted.

ratificat-lon or rejection of the action of the board of mayor
and aldermen of the Town of Milan, in regard to the issuance
of the $12,000 in bonds to the Mississippi Central Railroad
Company upon certain conditions. The returns of said election show a vote of 117 for subscription and 2 no subscription;" "W. M. McCall and W. H. Algea were appointed a
committee to correspond with Judge Milton Brown, of Jackson, Tenn., in regard to the proposition of Milan corporation
in regard to issuing the $12,000 in bonds to the Mississippi
,Central Railroad Company;" that the foregoing entries constitute all the proceedings in regard to the subscription of the
$12,000 in bonds, and in regard to the election held for ratifying or rejecting the action of the board in directing the issue
-of the bonds; that there was nothing to show the manner in
which the election was held, or by whom the returns were
made, or that the required number of votes was polled in
favor of the proposition, as required by law; that the order of
the board directing the issue of the bonds was without authority, (1) because the order was adopted and the election ordered
without any application in writing, or otherwise, to the board
for the purpose, as required by section 1144 of the Code of
Tennessee; (2) because the, election was ordered to be held,
.nd was held, by the town marshal or constable, and not by
the sheriff of the county of Gibson, as required by section 1143
-of the Code; (3) because the marshal, after the polls were
opened, and before they were closed, suffered the box in
which the votes were deposited to be removed from the place
in the town fixed for receiving ballots, to various other places
in the town, and put into the ballot-box votes offered at such
places not fixed by law as a place of voting, and without authority; and (4:) because, at the time, the entire line of the
,contemplated road in which the stock was to be taken had not
been surveyed by a competent engineer and substantially located
by designating the termini and approximating the general
-direction of the road, and no estimate of the grading, embankment, and masonry had been made by any one authorized to
make it, and no such estimate as was required by section 1145
of the Code had ever been filed ; that, at the time of ordering

and holding such election, the population of Milan was less
than 1000 inhabitants, and, therefore, it was not authorized
by law to take stock in railroads, issue bonds, or levy a tax
for their payment; that, on the 23d of June, 1873, the said
board made the following order: "On motion of W. M.
McCall, the mayor was instructed to issue twelve bonds to the
said Mississippi Central Railroad Company, of the denomination of $1000 each, with interest from date of issuance at the
rate of 7 per cent per annum ;" that, thereupon, said mayor
prepared twelve bonds, designated as the "Bonds of the Town
of Milan," of $1000 each, payable to the Mississippi Central
Railroad Company, or bearer, twenty years from the date of
issue, and dated July 1, 1873, bearing 7 per cent interest per
annum, to which bonds were attached coupons for the payment of such interest on the 1st of July of each year the
bonds had to run, each one of the bonds and coupons being
signed by A. Jordan, mayor and recorder, and being made
payable in the city of New York; that, on the 4th of August,
1883, the bonds and coupons were delivered to the Mississippi
Central Railroad Company, through one Hall, its treasurer
and cashier; that the bonds, with the coupons, one year's
interest being due on July 1, 1874, were still in the possession
of Rall, or some other officer or agent of the company, and the
company was attempting to collect the interest due on the
bonds; that the town was not bound to pay the bonds, their
issue being made contrary to law, but, if the company should
sell them to innocent purchasers, the town would be bound in
law to pay them; that the officers of the company would sell
and assign the bonds, with a view to making the town liable,
if they had not already done so in part; and that they were
attempting to negotiate them, and would do so unless restrained by injunction. The bill prayed that the company
and its officers be enjoined perpetually from transferring or
disposing of the bonds and coupons, and from collecting the
same; and that they be delivered up and cancelled.
On the 10th of July, 1874, (the same day on which the bill
was filed,) a temporary injunction, in accordance with its
prayer, was issued. The defendants thereafter filed a deVOL. cxXVII-1O

following final decree was entered in the suit:

"Be it remembered, that this cause, this 9th of January,
1875, came on to be heard and was heard before Hon. John

"In pursuance of this agreement, and by consent of the
parties, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the New
Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago R. R. Co. shall issue to the
Town of Milan certificates of stock in said company, in sums
of $500 each, dollar for dollar, for said twelve bonds of $1000
each, referred to in the bill; and it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that, on the presentation of these certificates of stock, the Town of Milan shall have the corporate
seal of said town affixed to each of said twelve bonds, and
delivered to H. S. McComb, to whom they rightfully belong,
or his authorized agent, and said bonds and coupons attached
are declared to be valid and binding on said town and its
authorities. It is, by consent, further ordered, adjudged, and
decreed, that the injunction be dissolved, the demurrer herein
filed be, and the same is hereby, overruled, and this decree is
declared a final settlement of the right of the parties; the
New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad Company to
pay the costs, and this case only retained on the docket so far
as is necessary to enforce the final execution of this decree."
It was further agreed by said stipulation, that the records
of the town were destroyed by fire in 1879; that no census
authorized by law, of the town, had been taken before 1880,
when the population was ascertained to be 1600; that the
railroad was not completed to the town until after July, 1873;
that, after the final decree in the Chancery Court, the plaintiffs became the owners of the bonds and the coupons attached, purchasing the same for value and before they were
due; and that, in the proposition submitted to the voters of
the town, the question of subscribing $12,000 to the stock of
the railroad company, payable in the bonds, "was also submitted in one question and at one and the same time, and was
so approved by the requisite majority."
The bill of exceptions stated that the plaintiffs offered ii
evidence the above named record of the Chancery Court at
Humboldt, found in the stipulation; that the defendant,
waiving all other objections, objected to the same because the
record showed upon its face that it was not binding in law
upon the town as a matter of adjudication, and, therefore, did

not sustain the replication to the plea; thai the court sustained the objection and the plaintiff excepted; and that the
court found, as one of the facts to support its judgment, that,
at the time the bonds and coupons were issued, the town did
iiot contain 1000 inhabitants.
'The court found that the facts and the law were with the
defendant, and rendered a judgment in its favor, for the costs

MR. JusTicE BLATCHFORD, after stating the case, delivered
the oDinion of the court.
Two ciuestions arise for consideration in this case, (1) as to
the statutory authority for the issue of the bonds; (2) as to
the effect of the decree of January 9, 1875, in the suit in the
state court of Chancery.

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

The bonds in'question were issued in payment of a subscription made by the town to the stock of the Mississippi
Central :Railroad Company. On their face, they do not recite
any such subscription to stock, but recite, as the consideration
for the bonds, the "location of the Mississippi Central railroad by said town." It is well settled, that a municipal
corporation, in order to exercise the power of becoming a
stockholder in a railroad corporation, must have such power
expressly conferred upon it by a grant from the legislature;
and that even the power to subscribe for such stock does not
carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment
of the subscription, unless the power to issue such bonds is
expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute.
Such is the law as recognized by the Supreme Court of
Tennessee, in the case of Pulaski v. Gilmore, decided in 1880,
and published in 21 Fed. Rep. 870, and in Taxpayers of Xilan
v. Tennessee Central Railroad,11 Lea, 330, decided in 1883.
Such is also the law as established by this court. -Marshv.
Fulton County, 10 Wall. 676; Wells v. Supervisors, 102 IT. S.
625; Ottawa v. Carey, 108 T1. S.110, 123; Daviess County
v. Dickinson, 117 IU.
S.657, 663.
The grant of authority to a municipal corporation to subscribe for the stock of a railroad company does not carry with
it the power to issue negotiable bonds to pay for the subscription, or anything more than the power to raise money by
taxation to pay the amount of the subscription. If, in the
statute granting the power to subscribe for the stock, no
manner of paying the subscription is provided for, it cannot
be paid by issuing negotiable bonds. The practice in Tennessee, as shown by its statute books, has been to authorize
expressly the issuing of negotiable bonds by municipal corporations to pay for subscriptions to stock, in all cases where it
was desired to confer upon such corporations the power to
issue such bonds.
.By a statute passed in 1852, and carried into the Code of
Tennessee of 1857-8, (sections 1142 to 1161,) in force when
the bonds in this case were issued, any county, incorporated
town, or city was authorized (section 1142) to subscribe for

KELLEY v. MILAN.

Opinion of the Court.

stock to a specified amount of its taxable property "in railroads running to or contiguous thereto," upon certain specified
terms and conditions. An election was to be held (section 1143)
when ordered (section 1144) in a specified manner, after the
entire line of the road (section 1145) had been surveyed, and
a certain estimate of the grading, embankment, and masonry
had been made, and after a specified notice of the election
(section 1146) had been given. The statute (section 114)
prescribed the form of the vote, and provided (section 1148)
that the subscription should be made if a majority of the
votes cast should be in favor of it. Sections 1150, 1154, 1155,
1156, 1157, 1160, 1161, provided as follows:
"1150. As soon as the stock is subscribed, it is the duty of
the county court, or corporate authorities, to levy a tax upon
the taxable property, privileges and persons, liable by law to
taxation within the county or corporation limits, sufficient to
meet the instalments of subscription as made, and the cost
and expenses of collection, which tax shall be levied and collected like other taxes."
"1154. Not more than thirty-three and one-third per cent of
the stock subscribed as above can be collected in any one year.
"1155. The tax-collector, as fast as he makes collections,
shall pay the amounts over to the company.
"1156. He shall also, as he receives the tax, give to each
taxpayer a certificate in such form as the railroad company
may prescribe, showing the amount of such tax paid by him,
of which he shall retain a duplicate to be delivered to the
president of the railroad company, and such certificate is
negotiable by delivery or assignment, and, with a deduction
of its proportion of the cost of collection, is receivable in payment of either freight or passage on the railroad in which the
subscription is taken, after the expiration of one year from the
completion of such road.
"1157. The holder of such certificates to the amount of one
share or more of the stock of such railroad company, is entitled
to demand and receive from the company in lieu thereof, a certificate of stock in the capital stock of such company, which
will give him all the privileges of any other stockholder."

Opinion of the Court.

"1160. For the purpose of meeting unexpected contingencies, the county or corporation authorities may anticipate the
collection of the railroad tax by the issuance of warrants, bearing six per cent interest, and payable at such times as may be
desired by the railroad company, the warrants to be received
as payment of so much stock.
"1161. In such a case a sufficiency of the railroad tax shall
be paid into the county treasury to meet the warrants as they
fall due."
These provisions of the statute do not contemplate or authorize the issue of negotiable bonds. They provide distinctly for
the levying of a tax to meet the instalments of the subscription. Section 1160, in authorizing the issuing of warrants
made payable at such times as may be desired by the railroad
company, and to be received by it in payment for the stock,
only contemplates that the warrants shall be issued in anticipation of the collection of the tax, which, under the provisions
of section 1154, may be entirely collected in three years, but
cannot be collected more rapidly than one-third in each year;
and there is no implication that any warrants are to be issued
except to anticipate the collection of a tax, after such tax is
levied under the provisions of section 1150, and such levy is
to be made as soon as the stock is subscribed for, and is to be
the levy of 4 tax sufficient to meet the instalments of subscription as made, and the costs and expenses of collection, subject
to the provision of section 1154, that, although the levy of the
tax is made, not more than one-third of the stock subscription
can be collected in any one year. It is solely to anticipate
the collection of the tax, when it is collectible by virtue of the
terms of the levy, that the warrants are authorized, by section
1160, to be issued; and there is nothing in the statute which
contemplates that the warrants shall be made payable at any
time later than the time fixed for the collection of the instalments of the tax. These provisions exclude the power of issuing such negotiable bonds as were issued in this case.
It is contended by the plaintiffs that express authority for
issuing the bonds in question is to be found in an act of the
legislature of Tennessee, approved January 23, 18IM, being

Opinion of the Court.

chapter 50 of the Acts of 1870-71. In 1870, a new constitution
was adopted in Tennessee, section 29 of Article II. of which
reads as follows:
"SEc. 29. The general assembly shall have power to authorize the several counties and incorporated towns in this State to
impose taxes for county and corporation purposes respectively,
in such manner as shall be prescribed by law; and all property
shall be taxed according to its value, upon the principles
established in regard to state taxation. But the credit of no
county, city, or town shall be given or loaned to or in aid of
any person, company, association, or corporation, except upon
an election to be first held by the qualified voters of such
county, city, or town, and the assent of three-fourths of the
votes cast at said election. Nor shall any county, city, or
town become a stockholder with others in any company, association, or corporation, except upon a like election and the
assent of a like majority. But the counties of Grainger, Hawkins, Hancock, Union, Campbell, Scott, Morgan, Grundy,
Sumner, Smith, Fentress, Van Buren, White, Putnam, Overton, Jackson, Cumberland, Anderson, Henderson, Wayne,
Marshall, Cocke, Coffee, Macon, and the new county herein authorized to be established out of fractions of Sumner,
Macon, and Smith counties, and Roane, shall be excepted out
of the provisions of this section, so far that the assent of a
majority of the qualified voters of either of said counties voting on the question shall be sufficient, when the credit of such
county is given or loaned to any person, association, or corporation: .Provided,That the exception of the counties above
named shall not be in force beyond the year one thousand eight
hundred and eighty, and after that period they shall be subject to the three-fourths majority applicable to the other counties of the State."
The act approved January 23, 1871, was entitled "An act
to enforce article 2, § 29, of the Constitution, to Authorize the
Several Counties and Incorporated Towns in this State to
impose Taxes for County and Corporation Purposes." It read
as follows:
" SEcTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

State of Tennessee, That the several counties and incorporated
towns in this State may, and are hereby authorized to impose
taxes for county and corporation purposes, respectively, in the
following manner and upon the following conditions:
"1st. That all taxable property shall be taxed according to
its value, upon the principles established in regard to state
taxation.
"2d. The credit of no county, city, or town shall be given
or loaned to, or in aid of any person, company, association, or
corporation, except, first, upon the consent of a majority of
the Justices of the Peace of the county, at a Quarterly Term
of the County Court of such county, or a majority of the
Board of Mayor and Aldermen, as the case may be, of such
city or town, and upon an election afterwards held by the
qualified voters of said county, city, or town, and the assent
of three-fourths of the votes cast at said election. The said
County Court, or Board of Mayor and Aldermen, as the case
may be, shall spread upon their records the proposition and
the amount to be voted upon by the people, and shall have
full power to hold and conduct such elections according to
the laws regulating elections in this State; and if the assent
of three-fourths of the voters of such county, city, or town,
is had, then the County Court or Board of Mayor and Aldermen, as the case may be, shall have full power to make and
execute all necessary orders, bonds, and payments, in order to
carry out such loan or credit voted for as prescribed in this
act; nor shall any county, city, or town become a stockholder
with others in any company, association, or corporation, except
upon a like election, and the assent of a like majority, as
prescribed in this Act."
Section 2 of the act enacts the constitutional exception as
to the specified counties.
This act was manifestly passed for the object stated in its
title, to carry into effect the provisions of section 29 of article
2 of the constitution of 1870, and to prescribe the manner
and the conditions, in conformity with the provisions of that
section, in and upon which the several counties and incorporated towns in the State should have the right to impose

KELLEY v. MILAN.
Opinion of the Court.

taxes for county and corporation purposes. The second clause
of the first section of the act only provides, in the language
of the constitution, that "the credit of no county, city, or
town shall be given or loaned to or in aid of any person,
company, association, or corporation, except" upon the assent
of three-fourths of the votes cast at an election held by the
qualified voters of the county, city, or town. The clause then
goes on to provide, in the exact language of the constitution,
as follows: "Nor shall any county, city, or town become a
stockholder with others in any company, association, or corporation, except upon a like election and the assent of a like
majority."
The enactments in that clause are entirely inhibitory and
negative in their character. They do not confer any authority for the giving or loaning of credit upon any municipality,
nor confer the right upon any municipality to become a stockholder with others in any corporation; but they only prescribe
the condition, that no credit shall be given or loaned, and no
ownership of stock be created, unless the prescribed election
be first held and the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast
at it be first given. But the authority to give or loan credit,
and to become a stockholder, under the conditions prescribed
in the act of 18'11, must be found in an independent grant of
authority, in some other statutory provision, either general or
special. These were the views taken by the Supreme Court
of Tennessee, in the case of Pulaski v. Gilmore, before cited.
(See, also, Tax-payers of .Milan v. Tennessee Central Railroad,
It is further contended, that authority to issue the bonds
was given by an act of the legislature of Tennessee, approved
March 23, 1872, chapter 20 of the Acts of 1872, entitled,
"An act to Authorize the Mayor and City Council, or Mayor
and Board of Aldermen, of any Incorporated City or Town
in the State of Tennessee having a Population of from One
Thousand and upwards to Twenty Thousand Inhabitants, to
issue Bonds of said City or Town to the amount of :Fifteen
Thousand Dollars." That act is as follows:
' SEC. 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State

OCTOBER TERMT,

Opinion of the Court.

of Tennessee, That the M1ayor and City Council or the Board
of Mayor and Aldermen of any incorporated city or town in
the State of Tennessee, having a population of from one thousand to twenty thousand, are hereby authorized in their corporate capacity to issue the bonds of- the said city or town,
signed by the Mayor and countersigned by the Recorder of
said city or town, with coupons for interest attached, to an
amount not exceeding Fifteen Thousand Dollars. The Bonds
herein provided for may be executed of denominations from
Twenty-five to Five Hundred Dollars, at discretion of said
Mayor and City Council or Mayor and Aldermen, and to
mature at such times as may be fixed by said Mayor and City
Council or Mayor and Aldermen, from one to twenty years
after date, and bearing interest at the rate of eight per cent
per annum, payable semi-annually; the past-due coupons on
which bonds shall be receivable for taxes, and all other dues
to the corporation issuing the same: Provided, That the
bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be alone
for the purpose of paying outstanding liabilities against the
city or corporation issuing them, and shall not in any case
exceed the unsettled and matured liabilities or debts of such
city or corporation at the time of issuance thereof ; but in no
event shall the bonds be issued without the consent of threefourths of the qualified voters voting at an election to be held
for that purpose under the supervision of said Mayor and City
Council or Board of Aldermen.
"SEc. 2. Be it further' enacted, That the said Mayor and
City Council or Mayor and Aldermen of said city or town are
hereby authorized to issue at par such coupon bonds as are
provided for in this Act, to the holders of bona fide claims
against said city or town, in liquidation and discharge of such
claims and interest thereon, and to such others as are willing
to take them at par, not to exceed in amount said sum of
fifteen thousand dollars: Provided, That in no case shall said
Mayor and City Council or Mayor and Aldermen of said city
or town, as the agent for that purpose, sell under their par
value any of the bonds the issuance of which is authorized by
this act: Providedfurther,That the proposed rate of interest

Opinion of the Court.

the bonds are to bear shall be specified and submitted to the
vote of the inhabitants of such corporations, at the time the
election is held in regard to the issuance of the bonds."
By the express provision of section 1 of this act, the bonds
to be issued under it are to "be alone for the purpose of paying outstanding liabilities against the city or corporation
issuing them;" and it is provided that they "shall not in any
case exceed the unsettled and matured liabilities or debts of
such city or corporation at the time of issuance thereof;"
and, by kection 2, they are to be issued "to the holders of
bona fide claims against said city or town, in liquidation and
discharge of such claims and interest thereon, and to such
others as are willing to take them at par."
We are of opinion that this statute has no application to the
present case. Its object was manifestly to enable certain
incorporated cities and towns to fund their matured debts, by
issuing bonds of the character specified in the act. The debts
for which they were to be issued were not only to be unsettled
debts, but matured debts, and the bonds were not to be issued
in any event without the consent of three-fourths of the
qualified voters voting at an election to be held for the purpose. When the election in the present case was held, no debt
created. by any subscription to any stock had yet been incurred; and it is expressly stipulated, in the agreed statement
of facts, that the question of subscribing $12,000 to the stock
of the company, and the question of paying such subscription
in bonds, were submitted to the voters as a single question, at
one and the same time, and were approved by the same vote.
Indeed, from the record of the proceedings of the board of
mayor and aldermen of the town, there does not appear to
have been any submission to the voters of the question of subscribing to the stock of the railroad company, or of issuing the
bonds in payment for any such subscription, but only the
question of whether the bonds should be issued by the town
to the company as a donation or subscription of bonds; and
the bonds themselves, on their face, carry out only the same
idea. Still, it is agreed that the bonds were issued in payment
of a "stock subscription" made by the town to the railroad

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

company. But, even in that view, the liability on the subscription to the stock was not such a matured liability or debt
of the town, at the, time the'election was held, as the act of
1872 refers to. The vote of the people was, at most, a vote to
subscribe for the stock. The terms of the vote appear to have
been "For subscription," or "iNo subscription." The vote to
subscribe for the stock and the vote to issue the bonds were
one and the same vote, comprehended in the words "For
subscription." In order to make the liability for the subscription a "matured" liability of the town, it was necessary
that the subscription should be actually made, in pursuance of
the vote, and that the terms for paying the money in discharge
of it should be determined, and that an election should be
thereafter held to vote in regard to issuing bonds for the
liability, as a matured liability, and in view of all the terms
and circumstances of such, liability. No such election was
held after any liability for the subscription became a matured
liability.
In regard to the effect of the decree of the Chancery Court,
of January 9, 1875, it is to be said, that it was made in a
suit by the town authorities to enjoin perpetually the collection of the bonds, on the ground that they were issued without authority of law. By the decree it was ordered, by consent of the parties, that the preliminary injunction should be
dissolved and the demurrer be overruled. This left the bill to
stand as it was originally filed. The decree sets forth that
the suit had been settled by an agreement, a copy of which
is embodied in the decree. That agreement refers to the
bonds as having been issued by the town "to aid in the construction of said road," that is, the road of the Mississippi
Central Railroad Company. It does not refer to the bonds
as having been issued in payment of a subscription to the stock
of the company. It then sets forth that it has been agreed
by the town and the New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago
Railroad Company, (into which the Mississippi Central Railroad Company had been merged, by contract of consolidation
between the last-named company and the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad Company,) that the suit

Opinion of the Court.

should be compromised by the issue, by the New Orleans, St.
Louis and Chicago Railroad Company, to the town, of certificates of stock, in the sum of $500 each, dollar for dollar, for
the $12,000 of bonds, the town agreeing, on the receipt of the
stock, to let a decree be entered in the cause in favor of the
validity of the bonds, which were to be redelivered, with the
seal of the town affixed, and the costs of the suit were to be
paid by the New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad
Company.
The substance of this is that, on the bill, it standing good,
with the demurrer to be overruled, the plaintiffs agree, notwithstanding the averments of the bill, that the bonds axe valid.
The decree then states, that, in pursuance of that agreement
and by consent of the parties, it is decreed, that the New
Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad Company shall issue
to the town the certificates of stock in the company referred
to in the agreement; that, on the presentation of those certificates, the town shall have its corporate seal affixed to each
of the twelve bonds; and that the bonds and their coupons
are declared to be valid and binding on the town and its authorities.
This was no adjudication by the court of the validity of
the bonds, on the submission to it, as a judicial tribunal, of the
question of such validity. The declaration of the validity of
the bonds, contained in the decree, was made solely in pursuance of the consent to that effect contained in the agreement
signed by the mayor of the town and the officer of the New
Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago Railroad Company. The act of
the mayor, in signing that agreement, could give no validity
to the bonds, if they had none at the time the agreement was
made. The want of authority to issue them extended to a
want of authority to declare them valid. The mayor had no
such authority. The decree of the court was based solely upon
the declaration of the mayor, in the agreement, that the bonds
were valid; and that declaration was of no more effect than
the declaration of the mayor, in the bill in chancery, that the
bonds were invalid.
The adjudication in the decree cannot, under the circum-

Statement of the Case.

stances, be set up as a judicial determination of the validity
of the bonds. (Russell v. Place, 94 U. S. 606; .Afanhattam
Life Ins. Co. v. Broughton, 109 U. S. 121, 125.) This was
not the case of a submission to the court of a question for
its decision on the merits, but it was a consent in advance to a
particular decision, by a person wbo bad no right to bind the
town by such a consent, because it gave life to invalid bonds;
and the authorities of the town had no more power to do so
than they had to issue the bonds originally.
There is nothing inconsistent with this view in Nashville
&c. Railway Co. v. United.States,(113 U. S. 261,) where it was
held, that a decree in equity, by consent of parties, and upon
a compromise between them, was a bar to a subsequent suit
upon a claim therein set forth as among the matters compromised and settled, although not in fact litigated in the suit in
which the decree was rendered. In that case both parties
had full power to make the compromise involved.

NORTON v. DYERSBURG.
ERROR

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THL
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
No. 207. Argued April 5, 1888.- -Decided

April 23, 1888.

In this case, certain negotiable bonds issued by the town of Dyersburg,

Tennessee, were held to have been issued without lawful authority.
Certain provisions of the statutes of Tennessee considered and held not to
confer power on the town of Dyersburg to issue the bonds in question.
The grant to a municipal corporation of the power to subscribe for stock
in a railroad company does not carry with it the implied authority to
issue negotiable bonds therefor; and such is the view of the Supreme
Court of Tennessee.
In a suit at law against the town to recover on the bonds, no question
growing out of the liability of the town for the subscription to the stock
can be inquired into.
THE

court stated the case as follows:
