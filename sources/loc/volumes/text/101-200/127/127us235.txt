PORTER v. WHITE.
APPEAL FROMt THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUM1BIA.
No. 221. Argued April 12, 1888.-Decided April 30, 1888.

In this case it was held, on the facts, that the plaintiff in a suit in equity had
not established his right to a decree that he is entitled to the one-half of
the attorney's fees in an award against Mexico by the joint United States
and Mexican commission, which fees had been collected by the defendant.
The plaintiff failed to establish any equitable lien on the award, by showing
a distinct appropriation of a part of it in his favor, or any agreement
for his payment out of it.

JUSTICE BLATCHFORD

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia, by Richard H. Porter against Stephen
V. White. The case arises as follows: On the 4th of July,
1868, a convention was concluded between the United States
and Mexico, 15 Stat. 679, providing for the adjustment of the
claims of citizens of either country against the other, under
which all claims on the part of citizens of either country upon
the other, arising from injuries to their persons or property by
the authorities of the other, which might have been presented
to either government for its interposition with the other, since
the signature of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, of 1848, and
which yet remained unsettled, as well as any other such claims
which might be presented within the time specified in the convention, (but not covering any claim arising out of a transaction of a date prior to February 2, 1848,) were referred to two

commissioners, one to be appointed by each government, and
the two commissioners to appoint an umpire to act in cases on
which they might themselves differ in opinion. The decision on
each claim was to be given in writing, and to designate whether
any sum which might be allowed should be payable in gold or in
the currency of the TJnited States. It was provided in the convention that each government engaged "to consider the decision of the commissioners conjointly, or of the umpire, as the
case may be, as absolutely final and conclusive upon each
claim decided upon by them or him, respectively, and to give
fall effect to such decisions without any objection, evasion, or
delay whatsoever." It was further provided, that the total
amount awarded in all the cases decided in favor of the citizens of one government should be deducted from the total'
amount awarded to the citizens of the other, and the balance,
to the amount of $300,000, should be paid at the city of Mexico or at the city of Washington, in gold or its equivalent,
within twelve months from the close of the commission, to
the government in favor of whose citizens the greater amount
might have been awarded, without interest or any other deduction than that specified in Article 6 of the convention;
and that the residue of such balance should be paid in annual
instalments, to an amount not exceeding $300,000, in gold or
its equivalent, in any one year, until the whole should have
been paid. Article 6 provided for the compensation of the
commissioners, the umpire, and the secretaries, and provided
that the whole expenses of the commission, including contingent expenses, should be defrayed by a ratable deduction on
the amount of the sums awarded by the commission, provided
that such deduction should not exceed 5 per cent on the sums
so awarded, and that the deficiency, if any, should be -defrayed
in moieties by the two governments. By successive conventions, 17 Stat. 861; 18 Stat. 760, and 18 Stat. 833, the duration of the commission, which had been originally limited to
two years and six months from the day of the first meeting of
the commissioners, was extended until the 31st of January,
1876; and, by a convention concluded April 29, 1876, 19 Stat.
642, the time for decision by the umpire was extended until
the 20th of November, 1876.

PORTER v. WHITE.
Opinion of the Court.

By an act of Congress passed June 18, 1878, c. 262, 20 Stat.
144, entitled "An act to provide for the distribution of the
awards made under the convention between the United States
of America and the Republic of Mexico, concluded on the
fourth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight," it was
provided (ยง 1) as follows: "That the Secretary of State be,
and he is hereby, authorized and required to receive any and
all moneys which may be paid by the Mexican Republic under
and in pursuance of the conventions between the United States
and the Mexican Republic for the adjustment of claims, concluded July fourth, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, and
April twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and seventy-six; and
whenever, and as often as, any instalments shall have been
paid by the Mexican Republic on account of said awards, to
distribute the moneys so received in ratable proportions among
the corporations, companies, or private individuals respectively
in whose favor awards have been made by said commissioners,
or by the umpires, or to their legal representatives or assigns,
except as in this act otherwise limited or provided, according
to the proportion which their respective awards shall bear to
the whole amount of such moneys then held by him, and to
pay the same, without other charge or deduction than is hereinafter provided, to the parties respectively entitled thereto.
And in making such distribution and payment, due regard
shall be had to the value at the time of such distribution of
the respective currencies in which the said awards are made
payable; and the proportionate amount of any. award of
which by its terms the United States is entitled to retain a
part shall be deducted from the payment to be made on such
award, and shall be paid into the Treasury of the United
States as a part of the unappropriated money in the Treasury." Sections 3 and 4 of the same act provided as follows;
"Sec. 3. That out of the payments and instalments received
from Mexico, as aforesaid, on account of said awards, and out
of the moneys which shall be received by the Secretary of
State under the provisions of this act, the Secretary of State
shall, when and as the same shall be received and paid, and
before any payment to claimants, deduct therefrom and retain

a sum not to exceed five per centum of said moneys awarded
to citizens of the United States, until the aggregate of the
amounts so deducted and retained shall equal the sum of one
hundred and fourteen thousand nine hundred and forty-eight
dollars and seventy-four cents, being the amount of the expenses of the commission, including contingent expenses paid
by the United States in accordance with article six of the
treaty, as ascertained and determined in pursuance of the provisions of the said treaty; which said sums, when and as the
same are deducted and retained, shall be, by the Secretary of
State, transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and passed
to the account of, and be regarded as, unappropriated money
in the Treasury. Sec. 4. That in the payment of money, in
virtue of this act, to any corporation, company, or private individual, the Secretary of State shall first deduct and retain or
make reservation of such sums of money, if any, as may be
due to the United States from any corporation, company, or
private individual in whose favor awards shall have been made
under the said convention."
Among the awards made by the commission was one to the
legal representatives of Austin M. Standish, of $42,486.30;
one to the legal representatives of Monroe M. Parsons, of
$50,828.76; and one to the legal representatives of Aaron A.
Conrow, of $50,497.26; those three persons having been
citizens of the United States who were unlawfully killed in
Mexico, in 1865, by the Mexican authorities. The awards
were made' in 1874 or 1875. The bill avers that, in 1869 or
1870, the plaintiff was authorized by powers of attorney
from the legal representatives of Standish, Parsons, and
Conrow to prosecute their claims for such unlawful killing,
before the commission; that the powers of attorney to the
plaintiff stipulated that he should be entitled, as compensation
for his services and expenses in the prosecution of the claims,
to one-half of whatever sums might be awarded by the commission to such legal representatives; that he prosecuted the
cases with sucdess, and paid or assumed to pay all the necessary expenses thereof; that, by virtue of his contract, he
became entitled to the one-half of the sums awarded, and the.

Opinion of the Court

legal representatives of the parties recognized his right to
such moieties, and respectively claimed for themselves only
the one-half of the awards; that there was, at the time of the
filing of the bill, in December, 1880, in the custody of the
Secretary of State of the United States, something over
$20,000 applicable to the moieties of the plaintiff upon the
three awards, and the Secretary was ready and willing to pay
the same whenever it should be determined who was entitled
thereto; that the plaintiff had, in 1876, Borrowed from the
defendant $5000, and given him, as security, a lien upon the
moiety of the plaintiff in the Parsons award, and a power of
attorney to collect such moiety; that, in 1877, he borrowed
from the defendant $2500 more, and executed to him an
absolute assignment of the plaintiff's moiety of the Standish
award, with the agreement that, although such assignment
was absolute in form, it was to be simply a security for the
money borrowed, and for services to be performed by the
defendant in collecting the moieties for the plaintiff ; that the
Secretary of State had refused to pay the plaintiff his interest
in the awards until the rights of certain parties, who had filed
claims with the Secretary upon the plaintiff's interest in the
fund, should be settled; that the defendant represented to the
plaintiff that he (the defendant) could procure the payment of
his interest in the awards, if the plaintiff would authorize him
to do so, and that, believing such representation, he gave to
the defendant "power of attorney to collect not only the
Standish and Parsons cases, which had been assigned to him,
but gave him also the said Conrow case, in which the defendant had no interest whatever;" that the defendant was now
claiming that he was the absolute owner of the two moieties in
the cases of Parsons and Standish, while his only real claim
upon the same was on account of his loan of the $7500; that
the defendant also refused to recognize the right of the plaintiff to the moiety of the Conrow claim, falsely alleging that
he had purchased the plaintiff's interest therein from one
Richard H. Musser, who set up a false claim to the one-half of
the plaintiff's moiety of the Conrow claim; that the Secretary
had decided that none of the claimants had any lien upon the

fund except the plaintiff and the defendant, and was ready
and willing to pay the amount which was in his control,
applicable to the three moieties, upon the joint receipt of the
plaintiff and the defendant; and that, inasmuch as the defendant held absolute assignments for the Parsons and Standish
-cases, the Secretary would not undertake to decide the rights
between the plaintiff and the defendant, but left them to
settle their controversy by adjustment, or by the determination of a court of competent jurisdiction.
The bill waives an answer on oath, and prays for a decree
that the defendant holds the assignment of the plaintiff's moieties in the cases of Standish and Parsons as security for the
plaintiff's indebtedness to him for money borrowed, and for no
,other purpose and in no other right; that he may be ordered
to cancel the moieties or reassign them to the plaintiff, upon the
payment to him by the plaintiff of the amount of money, with
interest, which the court may find that the plaintiff owes to
him; and that he may be decreed to empower the plaintiff to
-collect from the Secretary the amount of the instalments in
his hands, applicable to all three of the cases. The bill also
prays for such other and further relief as may be necessary.
A demurrer to the bill was overruled, and the defendant
put in an answer. The substance of the answer is that, in
1869 or 1870 the legal representatives or next of kin of the
three persons referred to made written executory contracts
with Musser, whereby he undertook to furnish the necessary
money and do the necessary leg-l work to establish the claims,
and the claimants undertook, on such services and money being furnished, to pay him a fee which should equal the moiety
,of any award in the premises, in each case; that, in pursuance
-of such contracts, the claimants executed powers of attorney,
whereby Iusser was constituted attorney in fact, irrevocable,
with a statement that the power of attorney was coupled with
an interest; that, about that time, there was a verbal contract
made between Musser and the plaintiff, whereby it was agreed
that the plaintiff should furnish the money and Iusser should
,do the legal work, and the two should divide the fees of Musser
:under the contract; that the plaintiff failed to furnish the

PORTER v. WHITE.
Opinion of the Court.

money to carry on the suits, and undertook to dismiss Musser
from the cases, leaving Musser with the respohsibility of furnishing money and doing the legal work; that, in the discharge of his duties under his agreements with the claimants,
Musser retained the legal firm of Pike & Johnson, and the
claimants agreed in writing that that firm should receive 25
per cent of the resulting awards, to be taken from :Musser's
moiety; that, on the making of the awards, the several claimants executed assignments to Musser and Pike & Johnson, for
a moiety of each of the awards; and that, on the 12th of February, 1879, Musser and Pike & Johnson, for the consideration
of $30,000, sold and assigned such moiely to the defendant in
his own right. There are other allegations in the answer,
which it is unnecessary to set forth, in the view we take of tfie
case.
A replication was put in to the answer, and proofs were
taken on both sides. The court, in special term, in February,
1883, made a decree as follows: "The court finds that the
plaintiff is entitled to the one full, equal half of the attorney's
fees in the awards against Mexico by the joint United States
and Mexican commission in the case of Mary Ann Conrow,
referred to in the bill and proceedings in this case, and the
defendant is entitled to the other half. It appearing to the
court that the defendant White has been recognized by
the State Department as entitled to the whole of the sad
attorney's fees in said award, and that he has already been
paid by the State Department, from the instalments heretofore paid by Mexico upon said award, the following sums, at
the times following, to wit: on the 5th day of May, 1881,
$8896.81; on the 11th day of April, 1882, $1806.06; and that
there is now on hand in the State Department the sum of
$1806.06, applicable to said attorney's fee in said Conrow case,
and that there are seven more annual instalments to be paid
by Mexico upon said award, it is, this 27th day of February,
1883, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the said defendant do, within five days from this date, pay to the solicitors
of said complainant Porter the one-half the said sums by him
heretofore received upon said awards, with interest thereon

Opinion of the Court.

at the rate of six per cent per annum from the times of payinent to him as~aforesaid, to wit, $4448.41, with interest from
the fifth day of May, 1881, and $903.03, with interest thereon
from the 11th day of April, 1882; that said defendant assign
and transfer to the plaintiff, by such form of conveyance as
will be recognized by the State Department, the one equal
half of the payments yet to be made by Mexico upon said
award applicable to attorney's fee, including the amount now
in said Department applicable to said purpose, and that the
defendant pay the costs of this suit within ten days, or that
in default there6f, as well as in default of the payment of the
amount found-due to the said Porter, execution do issue therefor, as upon judgment at law."
This decree was a decision in favor of the plaintiff in regard
to the Conrow award only. It did not grant the relief prayed
by the bill in respect to the Parsons and Standish awards, anddecreed nothing in favor of the plaintiff in regard to those
awards. There is nothing in the record to show that either
party appealed to the general term of the court; but there
appears in the record a decree of the court in geheral term,
made December 24, 1883, which reads as follows: "This cause
came on to be heard at this term, and was argued by counsel; and thereupon, on this 24th day of December, A.D. 1883,
upon consideration thereof, it is found by the court, that the
equities thereof are with the defendant, and that the respective awards of S. Kearney Parsons against Mexico and Mildred Standish against Mexico were not assigned and delivered
by the plaintiff to the defendant as security for the return of
money, and that the-plaintiff is not the assignee of any portion of the award of Mary Ann Conrow against Mexico, but
that the defendant, Stephen V. White, is the assignee in his
own right of a moiety of each of the said three awards;
wherefore it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court,
that the judgment and decree heretofore entered in favor of
plaintiff against the defendant on February 27, 1883, in the
special term, be, and the same is hereby, vacated, annulled,
and held for naught, and the bill herein is dismissed, and that
the defendant, Stephen V. White, do have and recover of the

PORTER v. WHITE.
Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff, Richard H. Porter, his costs herein expended, taxed
at $-, and that he have execution therefor as in a suit of law,
and to said order the plaintiff prays an appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States, which is allowed."
Although the plaintiff has appealed from the whole of the
decree of the court in general term, it is stated in the brief of
his counsel that he did not appeal from the decree of the
court in special term, and is therefore concluded by the failure of that decree to award relief to him in respect to the Parsons and Standish claims; and that the dispute in this court
is limited to his right to one-half of the fees in the Conrow
case. Therefore, although the decree of the court in general
term finds that the awards in favor of the Parsons and Standish claims were not assigned and delivered by the plaintiff to
the defendant as security for the return of money, and although
that decree further finds that the defendant is the assignee in
his own right of a moiety of each of those two awards as well
as of a moiety of the Conrow award, and although the plaintiff appeals generally from that decree, no question arises in
this court as to any claim of the plaintiff to any share of the
Parsons and Standish awards, but the only portion of the decree of the court in general term drawn in question is that
which declares that the plaintiff is not the assignee of any portion of the Conrow award, but that the defendant is the assignee in his own right of a moiety of that award.
The claim of Porter in respect to the Conrow award is based
upon the contention that he procured Musser to obtain, for a
compensation to be paid to him by the plaintiff, powers of
attorney from the legal representatives of the three men who
had been killed, to prosecute the claims, the powers of attorney and contracts to contain the plaintiff's name as attorney
in fact, with a power of substitution; that Musser procured
the powers of attorney, and contracts in writing, in each of
the cases, for one-half of the recovery as a fee, but procured
the name of Musser to be inserted as attorney, instead of that
of the plaintiff; that, on the plaintiff's complaint of this, Musser substituted the plaintiff as attorney in each of the three
cases, by an indorsement on the power of attorney itself;

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

that the legal effect of those substitutions was to make the
plaintiff the attorney in all three of the cases, instead of Musser; that, under these substitutions, the plaintiff employed
attorneys in Washington, who with him prosecuted the cases
to success, Musser aiding in taking testimony; that the plaintiff paid Musser in full for all his services; that M usser had
no interest in the fees secured under the contracts with the
claimants; and that Musser disputed this, and, in 1872, employed the firm of Pike & Johnson, after the evidence in the
cases had been closed, and the printed arguments had been
filed, and the cases were awaiting a hearing.
It is further urged, on the part of the plaintiff, that it is admitted in the answer of the defendant that there was a verbal
contract between Musser and the 'laintiff that the plaintiff
should furnish the money and Musser should do the legal
work, and that the two should divide the fees of Musser under
the contract with the claimants; and much stress is laid upon
the decision of this court in Peugh v. Porter,112 U. S. 737,
made January 5, 1885, after the decree of the court in general
term in this suit, in which it is said that the agreement between
Musser and Porter was "that each should have an equal interest in the prosecution and proceeds of the claims in case of
recovery;" and upon the fact that White was a party yto that
suit.
But there is no evidence in the case that Porter had any
assignment in writing of any interest in the Conrow award,
or any written instrument creating any lien upon it, or its proceeds, by way of fee or otherwise, from either the claimants
of that award or from Musser.' The power of attorney'from
the widow of Conrow to Musser, dated December 10, 1869,
contains no assignment of any specific interest in the claim,
and the substitution of Porter by Musser, indorsed on such
power of attorney, and dated July 4, 1870, only states that
" Richard H. Porter is substituted and authorized to act under
the powers hereinabove given."
Under these views, the plaintiff has failed to establish any
equitable lien on the Conrow fund, by showing any distinct
appropriation of a part of that fund in his favor by the widow

PORTER v. WHITE.
Opinion of the Court.

of Coarow, either directly or indirectly, or any agreement,
direct or indirect, that the plaintiff should be paid out of that
fund. Wqight v. .EMtison, 1 Wall. 16; Trist v. Child, 21 Wall.
441, 441; Peugh v. Porter, 112 U. S. 737, ' 42. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the widow of Conrow, recognizing her agreement with Musser that he" should have as
compensation one-half of the money which should be awarded
to her on the claim, executed, on the 28th of March, 1872, a
written power of attorney to the firm of Pike & Johnson, to
prosecute her claim, which power revoked all prior powers executed by her in that behalf, a like power being executed at
the same time by the son of the deceased Conrow; that Mrs.
Conrow at that time agreed with Musser and the firm of Pike
& Johnson that that firm and Musser should have, between
them, as compensation, the one-half of whatever should be
awarded to her on the claim; that, on the 19th of December,
1878, she made a written request to the Secretary of State
to pay one-half of the award to herself, one-fourth of it to
Musser, and one-fourth of it to the firm of Pike & Johnson;
and that, on the 12th of February, 1879, Musser and the firm
of Pike & Johnson, by a written instrument executed by them,
assigned to the defendant all their interest in the Conrow claim,
the award on that claim having been made to Mrs. Conrow.
It is very clear that the plaintiff has no title to any relief
against the defendant, whatever he may have against Musser,
who is not a party to this suit. There is nothing in the case
of Peugh v. Porterwhich can affect the claim of the plaintiff
against the defendant.
Tie decree of the court below in general term is afflrmed.
