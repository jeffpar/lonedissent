Statement of the Case.

STUART v. GAY.
APPEAL FROM

THE DISTRICT

COURT

OF THE

UNITED STATES FOR

THE DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA.
No. 255. Submitted April 28, 1888.-Decided May 14, 1888.

When a decree of foreclosure and sale of mortgaged property grants to the
purchaser a credit for part of the purchase money, reserving a lien upon
the property to enforce its payment, the court may, if the purchaser
make default, and no rights of innocent third parties have intervened,
order a resale of the property upon a rule to the purchaser to show cause
why it should not be done.
The decree of foreclosure in this case conferred upon the purchaser at the
foreclosure sale no such right of acquiring the securities of the lower
classes to be paid from the fund realized from the sale, as would authorize
him, as such purchaser, to dispute, in a proceeding in the opiginal suit for
foreclosure to compel payment of the amount remaining due of the purchase money, the computations by the master, confirmed by the decree
of the court, of the amounts which the creditors of the higher classes
were to receive from the fund.
In marshalling the classes of debts entitled to be paid out of a fund arising
from a sale of mortgaged property under a decree of foreclosure, it is
Immaterial whether the master calculates the interest to a day prior to
the date of the decree of sale, or up to that day, for the purpose of determining the principal sum that is to bear interest thereafter.

THE decrees which are the subject of the present appeal
were rendered in a suit brought to enforce certain deeds of
trust and mortgage liens upon a tract of land in Greenbrier
County, West Virginia, known as the White Sulphur Springs,
in which it became necessary to sell the property for the payment of debts, and to marshall the liens on the same in the
order of their priority. The bill was filed in March, 1868, by
Charles S. Gay and his wife and others, creditors and lien
holders, suing as well for themselves as for all other creditors
having liens on the real estate, the title. to which, subject to
the incumbrances, was then vested in the White Sulphur
Springs Company. A portion of the indebtedness was represented by negotiable bonds, with coupons representing accruing interest thereon, and some of these had been severed

STUART v. GAY.
Statement of the Case.

from the principal obligation and bought for value by other
holders.
On April 23, 1868, the cause was referred to a master to report the amount and priorities of all liens upon the property,
whether created by mortgage, deed of trust, judgment, or
otherwise. On April 21, 1876, the master filed a report giving a statement of the liens, the name of each creditor, with
tha amount of the principal debt due to each, the amount of
the interest accrued thereon, and showing the total debt in
each case, including principal and interest. The indebtedness
was classified according to the order of priority of the liens.
The first six classes of debts enumerated in this report are the
only ones material to be considered, as in any event they absorb the whole amount for which the property was subsequently sold. In the aggregate they amounted to $299,857.88,
of which $185,133.27 is principal, and $114,724.61 is interest.
The interest was calculated to and aggregated as of the same
date, Octob~er 15, 1875, as to all the debts except the debts in
the first class known as the. Singleton trust debt, upon which
the unpaid interest, amounting to $36,000, was calculated to
July 1, 1868; the master reporting that all interest accrued
on this debt after that date had been paid.
On April 28, 1876, the court by a decree confirmed this report, no exception having been taken thereto, the decree having in fact been entered by the consent of parties. That decree
also contained a clause declaring that the interest on the Singleton debt of $36,000, which had remained unpaid from July
1, 1868, should constitute a principal sum, bearing interest
from the date of the decree. There was no express declaration
in the decree in respect to the computation of interest on the
other debts after October 15, 1875.
On M,ay 5, 1877, a decree of sale was made in which there
was no finding of any specific amount due, in default of the
payment of which the property should be sold, but a recital
that it appeared to the court "that it is now for the interest
of all the parties to this suit and of all others interested in the
subject involved therein, and there being now no objection, except on the'part of the White Sulphur Springs Company, that

there shall be a sale of the property known as the White Sulphur Springs property, and an application of proceeds of said
sale among the parties entitled thereto, according to their legal
rights and priorities." The decree appointed commissioners to
make the sale, who were required to receive from the purchaser
the payment of ten per cent of the purchase money in cash at
the time of the sale, and for the residue giving a credit of one,
two, three, four, and five years, in equal instalments, with interest thereon from the day of sale, and requiring good personal security for the payment of the first of said annual
instalments, and retaining the title as further security for all
of said instalments, or, in lieu of such personal security required of the purchaser for the first instalment of purchase
money, the commissioners were authorized to receive from the
purchaser as collateral security therefor any evidences of debt
proved in the cause, and which it may appear to the commissioners will certainly be paid from the proceeds of the sale, and
which may belong to the purchaser offering the same as collateral security, the just and fair amount of which collateral
shall be determined by the commissioners.
On May 4, 1878, no sale having been made, the court entered a decree reciting that the interest on three bonds known
as Erskine bonds, being those reported in class No. 6 by the
master, and being designated as No. 1, 2, and 3 of that class,
for the year ending October 15, 1868, and on the Beard bond,
designated as No. 4, in the same class, from October 15, 1868,
to October 15, 1877, except four per cent for the two years
ending October 15, 1875, and October 15, 1877, had not been
paid; that the property was ample to pay these bonds, principal and interest, as well as all prior liens, and that a sale of
the property had been postponed in the interest of subsequent
liens; and adjudged that the said unpaid interest on said bonds
should stand on the same footing with the interest on said
bonds which is evidenced by coupons, and bear interest from
the dates at which said interest became due until paid, and that
the assignees and holders of the interest of said bonds for said
years, or any part thereof which had been assigned and transferred by the holders of the bonds, should be entitled to have

STUART v. GAY.
Statement of the Case.

priority over said bonds, coupons, and other interest not transferred; such interest, however, transferred as aforesaid, to be
entitled to priority according to the dates of its maturity.
On May -, 1880, a decree was rendered confirming a sale of
the premises previously reported as having been made by the
commissioner for that purpose, to William A. Stuart, for
$340,000, wherein it was directed that the purchaser be at
once put in possession of the property, the title thereto being
retained by the court as security for the payment of the purchase money. The commissioners were directed to proceed to
collect from the purchaser the cash payment of ten per cent
upon the aggregate of the purchase money. The decree also
contained a declaration that. the court "will hereafter make
such orders as may be proper for the collection of the deferred
instalments of the purchase money and the distribution of the
same among the parties to this suit, according to their respective rights and interests." The commissioners in their report
of the sale stated that they had taken from the purchaser his
five bonds, each for the sum of $61,290, payable, respectively,
at one, two, three, four, and five years, bearing six per cent
interest from the day of sale, and on the bond due one year
after date that they had taken personal security.
On March 1, 1882, a decree was made appointing a special
commissioner fort that purpose, and directing him to execute
to William Stuart a deed with a special warranty for all the
property purchased by him at the sale made on March 31,
1880, in pursuance of the decree of sale previously rendered
in the cause; and directing that the deed reserve a lien upon
its face for the unpaid purchase money until the same is
fully paid off and discharged. The commissioner 1yas further
authorized and directed to settle with the said Stuart at any
time, upon his application, so far as the bonds for the purchase money had already matured, or as the same should
thereafter mature, -" by crediting upon the said bonds the
amounts to which the said William A. Stuart is entitled to
credit for the liens held by him, as recognized by the previous
decrees of this court establishing the order and priority of
liens, and by receiving from him in cash so much of the

amount of said bonds as may be going to other lien holders;"
and the commissioner "is also authorized to cancel and deliver
to said William A. Stuart any one or more of his said bonds,
whether the same have matured or not, on being satisfied that
the said Stuart is then holder and owner of all the claims
payable out of the proceeds of such bond or bonds." The
commissioner was also instructed to report to the court from
time to time his proceedings under the decree.
On January 5, 1884, a decree was made upon a report of
the commissioners of sale asking to be instructed as to the
proper manner of disbursing the fund. It was therein ordered
and decreed "that the commissioners of sale, in disbursing
and distributing the proceeds of the sale of the White Sulphur
Springs property heretofore made by them under a decree of
this court in this cause, and in paying therewith the debts
heretofore reported and decreed to be paid, shall calculate
interest upon the aggregate amount of the principal and
interest thereof, aggregated as of October 15, 1875, the date
to which the calculations are brought in the report of commissioner H. M. Mathews, heretofore made, filed, and confirmed in this cause, and not upon the original principals
alone."
On May 12, 1885, the commissioners of sale reported that
the fourth and fifth bonds executed by Stuart, the purchaser,
were past due and unpaid, each of said bonds being for the
sum of $61,290, with interest from March 30, 1880, on which
there was due at the date of said report the sum of $160,212.06. An order was thereon entered that a rule issue
against the said William A. Stuart, returnable on the 23d day
of the same month, requiring him to appear and show cause
why the property sold as aforesaid by the commissioners of
sale in this cause to him should not be resold at public auction
for cash to pay the unsatisfied instalments of purchase money
due by him as aforesaid, and why a decree should not be
made against him for so much of the unpaid purchase money
as the property upon a resale might not pay off and discharge, together with the costs of the proceedings. This rule
having been returned served, Stuart, by leave of the court,

STUART v. GAY.
Statement of the Case.

filed a petition praying that the decree of January 5, 1884, be
vacated, and that in lieu thereof the commissioners of sale be
directed, in distributing the proceeds of the sale of said real
estate and paying the five first liens thereon, to calculate the
interest on the original principal of each of said liens, and not
upon the principal and interest thereof aggregated and compounded as directed by the decree of January 5, 1884. In
that petition he sets forth that by computing interest on the
principal sums, as set out in the master's report of April 21,
1876, included in the first six classes, there would be due in
the aggregate about the sum of $330,000 on the day of sale,
and that according to that calculation the net proceeds of the
sale, after deducting the costs of suit, would pay off in full
the five first liens and about $130,000 on the sixth, but a very
much less amount computing interest on the principal and
interest aggregated of said liens from October 15, 1875. The
petition further alleges that before the sale of the real estate
to himself, he became the purchaser of a large number of the
debts reported as liens in the sixth class, and thus became
entitled to all of the proceeds of the sale applicable to that
class, with certain exceptions therein stated. The petition
thereupon states that by the order of January 5, 1884, made
long after the sale, and after the petitioner had become entitled to the proceeds thereof applicable to the larger part of
the sixth class of debts, the interest-bearing fund of said six
first liens was changed from $185,133.27, the original principal
of said liens, to the sum of $299,857.88, the principal and
interest of said liens aggregated as of October 15, 1875, and
the sum of $114,724.61 interest on said six first liens is thus
made to bear interest for almost four and one-half years
before sale is made, and also after sale until reached in their
proper order of priority as the purchase money of said real
estate fell due under the said sale, and that in this way a sum
over $30,000 of the proceeds of said sale is applied to the
payment of interest upon the interest of said liens, the principal part of which will, under said order of January 5, 1884,
be applicable to the interest computed on the said sixth lien,
and the entire amount of which will be deducted from the

principal of the debts in the said sixth lien, all of which principal is owned and controlled by the petitioner except $907.67.
On May 25, 1885, this petition was considered, its prayer for
relief denied, and the decree of January 5, 1884, confirmed.
Stuart then moved the court to quash and discharge the rule
awarded against him on a previous day of the term, which
motion the court overruled; and thereupon, by leave of the
court, he filed an answer to the rule; when a decree was
rendered finding due from Stuart on account of the purchase
money for the said sale, the sum of $160,212.06, with interest
thereon from May 12, 1885, for the payment of which a
decree was rendered against him, and that unless within thirty
days from that date he should pay the amount decreed against
him, the commissioners should proceed, upon proper notice,
to resell the property heretofore sold in the cause and bought
by him, at publi, auction, to the highest bidder for cash.
From this decree Stuart prayed an appeal, which the court
refused to allow " because the decrees in this cause fixing the
rights of the parties, determining the amounts, dignities, and
priorities of the debts, and directing sale of the property,
were all entered more than five years ago, and the decree of
January 5, 1884, was simply explanatory of a former decree."
Subsequently, on July 2, 1885, a petition for an appeal was
presented by Stuart to -Mr. Justice Harlan of this court,
praying an appeal which was allowed, from the decree of January 5, 1884, compounding the interest on the debts theretofore reported in said cause against the company as of October
15, 1875, and directing the commissioners, in distributing the
proceeds of the sale of the company's property, to pay interest
upon the interest on the said debts as of the date last aforesaid, and from the decree rendered May 25, 1885, rejecting
the petition for relief from the decree of January 5, 1884,
and directing a resale of the property. The errors assigned
are nine in number, but may be reduced to two:
First. That the decree of January 5, 1884, is erroneous in
aggregating all the principal and interest of all the debts reported against the White Sulphur Springs Company as of the
15th day of "October, 1875, as stated in said Commissioner

STUART v. GAY.
Citations for Appellees.

Mathews's report, and making said aggregate an interest-bearing fund as of that date. And in reference to this it is stated
that "the court, by its decrees of April 28, 1875, and of May
4, 1878, had adjudicated just how much of the interest on
these debts should bear interest and from what time, viz.,
$36,000 of the Singleton debt from April 28, 1876; one year's
interest on the Erskine debt from October 15, 1868; and the
interest on the S. 0. Beard debt of $907.67 for the years ending October 15, 1868, to October 15, 1877, subject to certain
credits, and gave special reasons therefor; and it was error in
the court to reverse or modify the adjudication so made, especially after your petitioner had become the owner of liens
affected by said adjudication and the purchaser of the property, with the right to use said liens in payment therefor,
relying upon the adjudication aforesaid, and as the same had
been adjudicated" in accordance with the decree of March
1, 1882.
Second. The decree of May 25, 1885, is erroneous in overruling the motion to quash and discharge the rule for a resale,
and in decreeing a resale of the property upon the rule after
the court had parted with the title thereto, and had conveyed
the property to the appellant, retaining a vendor's lien in the
deed for the unpaid purchase money.

MR. JUSTICE M -HEws, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellant cannot justly complain of the decree for a
resale on ihe ground that it was rendered upon a rule to show
cause. It does not appear that he was or could have been
prejudiced by the summary nature of the procedure. Re had
,full opportunity to answer, and was heard upon all the matters of defence, both in his answer to the rule and his petition
for a rehearing of the decree of January 5, 1884. All the
equities to which the appellant conceived himself entitled were
fairly and fully before the court. Nqo rights of innocent strangers had intervened, although the appellant had conveyed his
title to the White Sulphur Springs Compahy. That company
acquired its interest pendente lite, and with full notice from
the record that the purchase money was in part unpaid, and
that there was a subsisting lien reserved as security for its
payment. The action of the court was simply to enforce its
own decree against a purchaser from itself to compel compliance on his part with his contract. The cause was open and
pending, awaiting a final decree distributing the proceeds of
the sale, in which no further step could be taken until those
proceeds were paid into court in compliance with its orders.
For that purpose the court had control of the title to the real
estate sold by virtue of the decree for sale, and the reservation
of a lien for the unpaid purchase money expressed in the deed.

STUART v. GAY.
Opinion of the Court.

There was no reason for a resort to an original bill; the most
suitable and convenient practice was to enforce the obligation
of the purchaser in the same cause by a supplemental proceeding, and it was within the discretion of the court to adopt as the
proper method in this case the form of a rule to show cause.
Such is the clear implication from what was said by this
court in Koontz v. NYorthern,Bank, 16 Wall. 196, 202: "If
the court was deceived by the report of the receiver
or master, and the purchaser participated in creating the deception, it could undoubtedly, at any time before the rights
of innocent purchasers had intervened, have set the whole proceedingos, including the deed, aside. But after the rights of
such third parties had intervened its authority in that respect
could only be exercised consistently with protection to those
rights."
The rule is thus laid down in 2 Daniell's Chancery Practice,
1282, c. 29, § 1: "According, however, to the present practice,
a more complete remedy is afforded against a purchaser refusing without cause to fulfil his contract; for the plaintiff may
obtain an order for the estate to be resold and for the purchaser to pay, as well the expenses arising from the non-completion of the purchase, the application, and the resale, as also
any deficiency in price arising upon the second sale. This
order was made by Lord Cottenham in Hardingv. Harding,
4 Iyln. & Cr. 514, after consultation with the other judges
of the court; and although in that case the purchaser was a
defendant in the cause, it does not seem that that fact was
considered as necessary in order to enable such an order to be
made." In Campbell v. Gardner,3 Stockton (11 N. J. Eq.)
423, 425, it was held that after a sale upon an execution out
of a court of chancery, and a delivery of the deed, the court
may, upon a proper cause made, open a sale upon a petition,
and it is not a valid objection to this course that the deed has
become a matter of record. If a resale is ordered, the court
may require the first purchaser to release to the purchaser on
the resale all the title he may have acquired, so that the title
may stand upon the record wholly disembarrassed. See Conover v. Walling, 2 McCarter (15 N. J.Eq.) 173.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

As the court below committed no error to the prejudice of
the appellant in the mode of the procedure, we have to consider whether it disallowed any substantial equity to which he
was entitled. The equity of the appellant, then asserted and
here renewed, arises upon his construction of the orders and
decrees of the court. The decree of March 1, 1882, upon the
authority of which the deed was executed and delivered to
the purchaser, and which directed that a lien should be reserved therein for the unpaid purchase money until the same
is fully paid off and discharged, also directed the commissioners
to settle with the purchaser upon his application, so far as the
bonds for the purchase money had already matured, or as the
same should thereafter mature, "by crediting upon the said
bonds the amounts to which the said William A. Stuart is
entitled to credit for the liens held by him, as recognized by
the previous decrees of this court establishing the order and
priority of liens, and by receiving from him in cash so much
of the amount of said bonds as may be going to other lien
holders." And the commissioners were "also authorized to
cancel and deliver to said William A. Stuart any one or more
of his said bonds, whether the same have matured or not, on
being satisfied that the said Stuart is then holder and owner
of all the claims payable out of the proceeds of such bond or
bonds."
It appears that in pursuance of this authority, the commissioners of sale, on October 20, 1883, received from Stuart certain securities designated by reference to the list and classification contained in the master's report of April 21, 1876,
specifying the amount of the principal sum represented by
each, but without any calculation of interest, or any statement of the aggregate amount which on account thereof was
to be credited on the bonds of the purchaser given for the
purchase money. The language of the receipt given by the
commissioners is: "Received of W. A. Stuart the above securities, which are applied first to the discharge of the three
purchase-money bonds of said Stuart first falling due, given
for the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs property sold by
the United States District Court, at Charleston, the said bonds

STUART v. GAY.
Opinion of the Court.

being for $61,290 each, and bearing interest from March 31,
1880, and which are this day delivered to said Stuart. The
amount covered by this list of securities, after discharging the
three bonds aforesaid, is to be by us credited on the fourth bond
of said Stuart of like amount with each of the other three and
bearing interest from same time."
The specific claim made by the appellant is, that he is entitled to have these securities credited on his purchase-money
bonds at an amount in the aggregate ascertained by a calculation of simple interest, upon the face of the principal sum,
from the time when interest began to accrue and became in
default until the date of their application to the payment of
the purchase-money bonds, with the exception of the instances
where by previous decrees interest upon interest had been
expressly allowed; whereas the rule adopted by the court by
the order of January 5, 1884, required the commissioners of
sale, in distributing the proceeds of sale, and in paying therewith the debts reported and decreed to be paid, to calculate
interest upon the aggregate amount of principal and interest
thereof aggregated as of October 15, 1875, the date to which
the calculations are brought in the report of the master filed
April 21, 1876.
It is complained of this decree that it was made after the
rights of the parties had become fixed by what had already been
done under the previous orders of the court, and that the situation of the appellant was thereby- altered greatly to his disadvantage. In reliance upon his construction of the previous
orders of the court, the appellant had become the purchaser of
almost all the obligations enumerated in the sixth class of the
master's report in the expectation that, upon a calculation of
the amount due to those entitled to priority, the obligations
thus acquired by him would be satisfied, or nearly so, out of
the proceeds of the sale. The transactions by which he acquired the ownership of these claims took place, respectively,
on April 23, 1875, March 15, 1876, and March 31, 1880, the
last being the date of the sale.
It is evident, in the first place, that the cause of complaint
asserted by the appellant does not belong to him legitimately
VOL. cxxvi-34

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

in his capacity as purchaser. The decree for sale rendered
May 15, 1877, did not contemplate payment of the purchase
money otherwise than in money. It gave a credit running
through a period of five years in equal annual instalments,
with interest on each. There was nothing in the decree
which authorized the purchaser to assume that he would not
be called upon to pay each instalment as it fell due in cash.
As a purchaser, therefore, bound for the payment of specific
sums at given dates, and who cannot be compelled to paymore, and has no right to expect to pay less, it must be a matter of indifference how the proceeds of that sale shall be distributed among the creditors entitled thereto. The different
modes of computing interest on the debts to be paid may
affect relatively the creditors themselves, giving to one class
more and to the other less, but it can make no difference in
the amount of the fund to be distributed arising from the proceeds of the sale. The complaint of the appellant, therefore,
if he has any, must be put forward in his capacity as a creditor in respect to his rights upon distribution; but upon the
view most favorable to him the distribution of the proceeds of
the sale, and all questions arising thereon as between creditors,
were before the court and undecided, except in the instances
already referred to where express declarations were made in
respect to the mode of computing interest upon interest in
individual cases. The appellant was bound to know, and
ought to have acted upon the assumption, that all possible
matters of question to arise upon the distribution of the proceeds of the sale were still open for the final decision of the
court. If he chose to act upon his individual judgment of
what that decision would be, he acted at his peril. The decree
of January 5, 1884, was such a decision, directing the mode of
calculating interest upon the debt in distributing the proceeds
of sale, and there is nothing in it inconsistent with any prior
decision or decree of the court upon the same subject. Neither
the decree of sale of IMay 5, '1877, nor the decree of March 1,
1882, directing the execution of the deed and reserving a
lien for the unpaid purchase money, contained any direction
- as to the mode of computing interest upon the debts to be

STUART v. GAY.
Opinion of the Court.

paid. It cannot, therefore, be now held that the appellant
has been misled to his disadvantage in having acted upon the
faith of any of the previous decrees of the court in the cause.
The question, however, still recurs whether the rule for
computing interest on the debts as the basis of distribution
adopted by the court in its decree of January 5, 1884, is correct as a matter of law. On this point there is no reason for
doubt. The decree of sale, as we have already stated, contained no finding of the amount of the indebtedness, nor of
the persons to whom it was owing, and no order for its payment as a condition of redeeming the property from the necessity of sale. But the report of the master of April 21, 1876,
contained a full and carefully prepared detail of" all the items
constituting the indebtedness, with a list of the creditors, a
classification according to the order of priority in the matter
of lien, and a calculation of interest to October 15, 1875, upon
all debts, except those embraced in class No. 1, in respect to
which special provision was subsequently made showing the
total amount then due to each creditor. It is not stated anywhere in the record why the date of October 15, 1875, was
selected by the master as a place of rest in the calculation of
interest, but it must have been taken as the most convenient
day for calculations in reference to closing the report, which
evidently required considerable time for its preparation. If
the calculation had been made as of the date of the decree for
sale, with a view to the insertion therein of the amounts due
to the several creditors, on payment of which the sale might
be averted, the interest would have been brought down most
properly to that date and added to the principal to constitute
the whole sum then payable. If not paid at that time, the
aggregate of principal and interest thus combined would have
constituted the new principal, which, according to the uniform
practice of the court, would bear interest from that date. In
that case there could have been no complaint made against
compounding interest. We think a similar effect must be
given to the decree of the court confirming the master's
report made April 28, 1876. It substantially declared the
-amount due October 15, 1875, as consisting of the principal

sums and interest to that date added for the purposes of the
sale and distribution, and the decree of January 5, 1884,
directing the calculation of interest for purposes of distribution upon the aggregate amount of the principal and interest
as of October 15, 1875, was only a proper explanation of the
decree of April 28, 187G, confirming the master's report. The
date of the confirmation of that report was a suitable period
in the progress of the cause, where the creditors were so
numerous and the calculations so complicated, for the court
to fix, for the information and guidance of all concerned, the
amount severally due to each creditor with the order of priority in which he was entitled to be paid. The amounts to be
found due necessarily embraced the principal sum with the
accrued interest up to a fixed date, and from that period the
aggregate became the sum of the debt, the whole of which
thenceforth properly carried interest. INo exception was taken
to the report; it was confirmed by the court; and, in our
opinion, it cannot reasonably bear any other construction than
that which the court subsequently -placed upon it.
Upon the whole case, no injustice has been done the appellant; and the decree of the District Court of West Virginia is

APPERA

FROM THE

CIRCUIT

COURT OF T

UNITED STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 291. Argued May 4,1888. -Decided

May 14, 1888.

A creditor whose debt is secured by a deed of trust of real estate to a third
party as trustee, may purchase the property at a sale by the trustee under
the terms of the trust; and if he credits the debtor on the mortgage debt
with the amount of the purchase money, it is in fact and in law a money
payment to the use and benefit of the debtor.
The plaintiff in error acquired by the purchase from the assignee in bankruptcy no interest either in the debt of the bankrupt to the defendant in
error, or in the real estate conveyed in trust to secure it.
