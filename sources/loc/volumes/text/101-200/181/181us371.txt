WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Statement of the Case.

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 283. Argued October 26, 29, 1900.-Decided April 29, 1901.
A constitutional right against unjust taxation is given for the protection
of private property, but it maybe waived by those affected, who consent
to such action to their property as would otherwise be invalid.
It was within the power of Congress, by the act of March 3, 1899, c. 431,
30 Stat. 1344, to extend S Street in the District of Columbia, to order the
opening and extension of the streets in question, and to direct the Commissioners of the District to institute and conduct proceedings in the
Supreme Court of the District to condemn the necessary land; and it was
also competent for Congress, in said act, to provide that, of the amount
found due and awarded as damages for and in respect of the land condemned for the opening of said streets, not less than one half thereof
should be assessed by the jury in said proceedings against the pieces and
parcels of ground situate and lying on each side of the extension of said
streets and also on all or any adjacent pieces or parcels of land which
will be benefited by the opening of said streets as provided for in said
act; and that the sums to be assessed against each lot or piece or parcel
of ground should be determined and designated by the jury, and that, in
determining what amount should be assessed against any particular piece
or parcel of ground, the jury should take into consideration the situation
of said lots, and the benefits that they might severally receive from the
opening of said streets.
The order of publication gave due notice of the filing of the petition in this
case, and an opportunity to all persons interested to show cause why the
prayer of the petition should not be granted; and operated as a notice to
all concerned of the pending appointment of a jury, and that proceedings
would be had under the act of Congress.
The act of March 3, 1899, was a valid act, and the proceedings thereunder
were regular and constituted due process of law.
The Court of Appeals, in regarding the decision in Norwood v. Baker, 172
U. S. 269, as overruling previous decisions of this court in respect to
Congressional legislation as to public local improvements in the District
of Columbia is overruled.
CONGRESS, by an act approved March 3, 1899, entitled "An
act to extend S street in the District of Columbia, and for other
purposes," 30 Stat. 1344, c. 431, enacted as follows:
" SECTION 1. That within thirty days from the passage of this

Statement of the Case.

act the Commissioners of the District of Columbia be and they
are hereby authorized and directed to institute by a petition in
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting as a District Court, a proceeding to condemn the land necessary to open
and extend S, Twenty-second and Decatur streets through lots
forty-one and forty-two of Phelps and Tuttle's subdivision of
Connecticut Avenue ileights, part of Widow's Mite: Provided,
That the owners of the ' Kall' tract dedicate the land in said
tract contained within the lines of said street: .And yrovided
firther, That of the amount found due and awarded as damages
for and in respect of the land condemned under this section for
the opening of said streets, not less than one half thereof shall
be assessed by the jury in said proceedings against the pieces
and parcels of ground situate and lying on each side of the extension of said streets, and also on all or any adjacent pieces or
parcels of land which will be benefited by the opening of said
streets as herein provided."
"SEc. 5. That the proceedings for the condemnation of said
lands shall be under and according to the provisions of chapter 11
of the Revised Statutes of the United States relating to the District of Columbia, which provide for the condemnation of land
in said District for public highways."
"SEc. 7. That the sums to be assessed against each lot and
piece and parcel of ground shall be determined and designated
by the jury, and in determining what amount shall be assessed
against any particular piece or parcel of ground, the jury shall
take into consideration the situation of said lots, and the benefits
that they may severally receive from the opening of said streets."
On March 31, 1899, the Commissioners filed a petition in the
Supreme Court of the District, alleging that the owners of the
Kall tract had dedicated to the District of Columbia, for highway purposes, the land in said tract contained within the lines
of S, Twenty-second and Decatur streets; that a map of the
proposed extension of said streets, showing the number and designation of lots affected, the names of the owners thereof, and
the areas of land required for the extension, had been prepared
and a copy thereof annexed to the petition; and praying the

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Statement of the Case.

court to direct the marshal of the District to summon a jury to
be and appear on the premises on a day specified, to assess the
damages, if any, which each owner of land through which said
streets were proposed to be extended, might sustain by reason
thereof, and that such other and further orders might be made
and proceedings had as were contemplated by the said act of
Congress and by chapter 11 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States, relating to the District of Columbia, to the end
that a permanent right of way for the public over said lands
might be obtained and secured for the extension of said streets.
On April 3, 1899, an order of publication was made by the
court directing all persons interested in the proceedings to appear in the court on or before the 22d day of April, 1899, and
show cause, if any they have, why the prayer of said petition
should not be granted, and that a copy of the order should be
published in the Washington Post and the Washington Times
newspapers at least six times and in the Washington Law Reporter once before the said 22d day of April, 1899.
On July 21, 1899, it was ordered by the court that, whereas
notice by advertisement had been duly published, a jury should
be summoned to be and appear upon the premises to assess the
damages, if any, which each owner of land may sustain by reason
of the condemnation of the land necessary to open and extend
said streets, as prayed in said petition, and directing that of the
amount due and awarded as damages by said jury in respect of
the land condemned for the opening of said streets not less than
one half thereof should be assessed by said jury against the
pieces and parcels of ground situated and lying on each side of
the extension of said streets, and also on all or any adjacent pieces
or parcels of land which would be benefited by the opening of
said streets; and to further proceed in accordance with the act
of Congress approved March 3, 1899.
On August 30, 1899, there was filed in the Supreme Court of
the District a return or report by the marshal, setting forth the
appointment and qualification of the jurors, and a statement of
the proceedings of said jury in taking testimony and hearing
arguments of counsel. With the report of the marshal there
was also filed a verdict in writing by the jury in the following
terms:

OCTOBER TER-M, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

"In the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, holding
a District Court for said District.
"Tn re extension of S, Twenty-second and Decatur streets.
-No. 549.
"We, the jury in the above-entitled cause, hereby find the
following verdict and award of damages for and in respect of
the land condemned and taken necessary to open and extend
S, Twenty-second and Decatur streets through lots forty-one
and forty-two of Phelps and Tuttle's subdivision of Connecticut
Avenue Heights, part of Widow's Mite, as shown on the plat
or map filed with the petition in this cause, as set forth in
schedule 1, hereto annexed as part hereof; and we, the jury
aforesaid, in accordance with the act of Congress, approved
March 3, 1899, for the extension of said streets, do hereby assess
the sum of $26,000, being not less than one half of the damages
so, as aforesaid, awarded in schedule 1 against the pieces and
parcels of land situate and lying on each side of the extension
of said streets, and also on adjacent pieces or parcels of land
which we find will be benefited by the extension of said streets,
as set forth in schedule 2, hereto annexed as part hereof."
By schedule 1, annexed to the award, it appears that the jury
awarded to the owners of parts of lots 41 and 42 of Phelps and
Tuttle's subdivision of Widow's Mite, as damages for land within the lines of S and Twenty-second streets extended, the sum of
$36,000, and to the owners of, part of lot 41, included in the
lines of Decatur place'extended, the sum of $16,000.
By schedule 2 it is shown that the jury apportioned one half
of said damages among the owners of pieces or parcels of land
benefited, and that among those found to be benefited were the
owners of the Kall tract, and against whose lands there were
assessed various sums amounting, in the aggregate, to $14,000.
On September 19, 1899, the Supreme Court of the District
entered an order confirming the award and assessment, unless
cause to the contrary should be shown on or before the 4th day
of October, 1899, and directing that a copy of said order
should be published once in the Washington Law Reporter
and twice in the Evening Star before that date; and further
ordering that the marshal should serve a copy of the order per-

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Statement of the Case.

sonally on all the owners of land condemned and all the owners
of land assessed in said verdict, with one half of the damages
awarded therein, who might be found within the District of Columbia, and if not found therein, then by mailing a copy thereof to the place of abode or last known place of residence of each
owner or owners.
On September 29, 1899, the marshal returned that he had
served a copy of the order personally on, among others, the appellees, and had mailed copies to such parties as resided without
the District.
On October 4, 1899, the appellees filed exceptions to the confirmation of the award and finding of the jury, as to the owners
of the tract of land known in the proceedings as the Kall tract.
The exceptions were as follows:
"First. Said award of damages and finding of the jury is not
warranted by the statute under which these proceedings are had
and taken, and by a proper construction thereof no damage can
be assessed against said tract of land, or any part thereof, or
these respondents as owners of said land.
"Second. Because said act is unconstitutional and void, in
that it contains no provision for notifying the owners of property to be assessed in advance of said assessment, nor at any
time pending the consideration of the cause by the jury, nor is
any mode designated by the statute by which the objections of
the owners whose land is sought to be charged with benefits can
be properly heard or considered, or by which any objection
they may have to such assessment might be made effective,
and for other vices and defects apparent on the face of the
statute.
"Third. Because the statute under which said assessment is
made is a statute relating to a condemnation of land solely, and
contains no provision touching the assessment of benefits, and
was not intended to provide for such assessment.
"Fourth. Because the statute authorizing the extension of
said streets, and the condemnation of land therefor, and the assessment of benefits, is, when taken in connection with the statute under which the condemnation proceedings were to be conducted, inconsistent and incapable of enforcement as to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

assessment of benefits against property forming no part of that
sought to be condemned.
"Fifth. Because the description of the property sought to be
charged with the assessment of benefits is inaccurate, insufficient and defective.
"Sixth. Because said award of damages and finding of the

jury in that behalf are excessive, unjust and unreasonable.
" These respondents therefore, each and severally, request
and demand said award and finding to be set aside, and that a
new jury be impanelled in accordance with the provisions of
the statute in such case made and provided."
On November 18, 1899, after argument, the exceptions were
overruled, and the verdict, award and assessment were in all respects confirmed. Thereupon the cause was taken on appeal
to the Court of Appeals of the District oC Columbia. On
April 25, 1900, the order and decree of the Supreme Court of
the District were reversed by the said Court of Appeals, and
the cause was remanded to the Supreme Court of the District,
with directions to vacate such order or decree and forsuchother
proceedings therein, if any, as might be proper and not inconsistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. 16 D. C.

SuRnAs, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Appeals of
the District of Columbia reversing an order or decree of the
Supreme Court of the District confirming an assessment upon
lands of the appellees for alleged benefits accruing from the
opening of certain streets adjoining such lands, and presents
for determination the constitutionality of an act of Congress,
approved IMarch 3, 1899, under which the assessment complained of was made.

WIGHT v,. DAVIDSON.
Opinion of the Court,

It may well be doubted whether the appellees are in a position to question the validity of the statute. They are the owners of the "Kall" tract mentioned in the first section of the
act, and with respect to which it was made a condition that
the owners should dedicate the land in said tract contained
within the lines of the streets to be extended; and, it appears
by the record, that, in order to procure the desired action of
the Commissioners, they did dedicate to the District of Columbia for highway purposes the land in said tract contained
within the lines of S, Twenty-second and Decatur streets.
Prior to the filing of the petition of the Commissioners, the
authorities of the District had taken no steps towards the contemplated extension of these streets. In fact, under the act
they had no power to do so. The power was called into action
by the dedication of the Kall tract. By such dedication the
appellees put the act into operation, and voluntarily subjected
themselves to its provisions, including the mode of assessment.
The constitutional right against unjust taxation is given for the
protection of private property, and may be waived by those
affected who consent to such action to their property as would
otherwise be invalid.
"Under some circumstances, a party who is illegally assessed
may be held to have waived all right to a remedy by a course
of conduct which renders it unjust and inequitable to others
that he should be allowed to complain of the illegality. Such
a case would exist if one should ask for and encourage the levy
of the tax of which he subsequently complains; and some of
the cases go far in the direction of holding that a mere failure
to give notice of objections to one who, with the knowledge of
the person taxed, as contractor or otherwise, is expending money
in reliance upon payment from the taxes, may have the same
effect." Cooley on Taxation, 573; Tagh v. Adams, 10 Cush.
252; Bidwell v. City of Pittsburgh,85 Penn. St. 412; Lafayette v. Fowler, 34 Ind. 140; Shutte v. Thompson, 15 Wall. 151,
159.
However, as we learn from this record that there are others
than the appellees concerned in the question of the validity of
the act of Congress, and as the decision of the Court of Appeals,

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

by declaring the act void as to the appellees, operates to defeat
or suspend proceedings under it, and under other existing acts
of Congress in similar terms, respecting public improvements
in the District, we prefer to pass by the question whether the
appellees are estopped by having made the dedication imposed
as a condition precedent to the opening of the streets, and to
place our decision upon the question discussed by the Court of
Appeals and which controlled its decision, namely, that of the
constitutionality of the act of Congress under which the proceedings were had.
The principal objections urged against the validity of the act
are, first, because, as is alleged, it arbitrarily fixes the amount
of benefits to be assessed upon the property, irrespective of the
amount of benefits actually received or conferred upon the land
assessed, by the opening of the streets; and, second, because it
contains no provision for notifying the owners of the property
to be assessed, in advance of such assessment, or at any time
pending the consideration of the cause by the jury.
In Baumam v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, on appeal from the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it was held that Congress may direct that, when part of a parcel of lan is appropriated to the public use for a highway in the District of
Columbia, the tribunal vested by law with the duty of assessing the compensation or damages due to the owner, whether
for the value of the part taken, or for any injury to the rest,
shall take into consideration, by way of lessening the whole or
either part of the sum due hirri, any special and direct benefits,
capable of present estimate and reasonable computation, caused
by the establishment of the highway to the part not taken;
that the estimate of the just compensation for property taken
for the public use, under the right of eminent domain, is not
required to be made by a jury, but may be entrusted to commissioners appointed by a court, or to an inquest consisting of
more or fewer men than an ordinary jury; that Congress, in
the exercise of the right of taxation in the District of Columnbia, may direct that half of the amount of the compensation or
damages awarded to the owners of lands appropriated to the
public use for a highway shall be assessed and charged upon

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Opinion of the Court.

the District of Columbia, and the other half upon the lands
benefited thereby within the District, in proportion to the benefit; and may commit the ascertainment of the lands to be
assessed, and the apportionment of the benefits among them,
to the same tribunal which assesses the compensation or damages; that if the legislature, in taxing lands benefited by a
highway, or other public improvement, makes provision for
notice, by publication or otherwise, to each owner of land, and
for hearing him, at some stage of the proceedings, upon the
question what proportion of the tax shall be assessed upon his
land, his property is not taken without due process of law.
In the opinion of the court in that case, delivered by Mr.
Justice Gray, it was said that the provisions of the statute
under consideration, which regulated the assessment of damages, are to be referred, not to the right of eminent domain,
but to the right of taxation, and that the legislature, in the
exercise of the right of taxation, has the authority to direct the
whole, or such part as it may prescribe, of the expense of a
public improvement, such as the establishing, the widening, the
grading or the repair of a street, to be assessed upon the owners
of lands benefited thereby; and that such authority has been
repeatedly exercised in the District of Columbia by Congress,
with the sanction of this court-citing Willard v. Presbury,
14 Wall. 676; Mfattingly v. District of Columbia., 97 U. S. 687;
Shoemaker v. Urnited States, 147 U. S. 282, 302. It was also
said that the class of lands to be assessed for the purpose may
be either determined by the legislature itself, by defining a
territorial district, or by other designation; or it may be left
by the legislature to the determination of commissioners, and
be made to consist of such lands, and such only, as the commissioners shall decide to be benefited; that the rule of apportionment among the parcels of land benefited also rests within the
discretion of the legislature, and may be directed to be in proportion to the position, the frontage, the area or the market
value of the lands, or in proportion to the benefits as estimated
by commissioners-citing the cases hereinbefore mentioned.
By the act of June 17, 1890, c. 428, 26 Stat. 159, Congress
enacted that the Commissioners of the District of Columbia

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

shall have the power to lay water mains and water pipes and
erect fire plugs and hydrants, whenever the same shall be, in
their judgment, necessary for the public safety, comfort or
health. By the act of August 11, 1891, c. 253, 28 Stat. 275, it
was provided "that hereafter assessments levied for laying
water mains in the District of Columbia shall be at the rate of
one dollar and twenty-five cents per linear front foot against
all lots or lands abutting upon the street, road or alley in which
a water main shall be laid."
On October 5, 1895, Homer B. Parsons filed in the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia a petition against the District
of Columbia and the Commissioners thereof, complaining, as
illegal, of a certain charge or special assessment against land
of the petitioner, as a water main tax or assessment for laying
a water main in the street on which said land abuts. After a
hearing upon the petition and return, the petition was dismissed.
An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia, where the judgment of the Supreme Court of the
District was affirmed. The cause was then brought to this
court, and by it the judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed. Parsons v. District of Columbia, 170 U. S. 45. The
principal grounds of complaint were that the lot owner was
given no opportunity to be heard upon the question of cost, or
utility, or benefit of the work, or of the apportionment of the tax;
that the assessment was made without any estimate of the cost
of the work to be done, and without regard to the cost of the
work or the value of the improvement, and not upon the basis
or benefits to the property assessed.
This court held that the legislation in question was that of
the United States, and must be considered in the light of the
conclusions, so often announced, that the United States possess
complete jurisdiction, both of a political and municipal nature,
over the District of Columbia-citing .faftingly v. District (f
Columbia, 97 U. S. 687; Gibbons v. District of Columbia, 116
U. S. 404; Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282; Bauman
V.]?oss, 167 U. S. 548; that when, by the act of August 11,
1894, Congress enacted that thereafter assessments levied for
laying water mains in the District of Columbia should be at the

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Opinion of the Court.

rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents per linear front foot
against all lots or land abutting upon the street, road or alley
in which a water main shall be laid, such act must be deemed
conclusive alike of the question of the necessity of the work,
and of the benefits as against abutting property; that to open
such questions for review by the courts, on the petition of any
and every property holder, would create endless confusion; that
where the legislature has submitted these questions for inquiry
to a commission, or to official persons to be appointed under
municipal ordinances or regulations, the inquiry becomes in its
nature judicial in such a sense that the property owner is entitled to a hearing, or to notice or an opportunity to be heard;
that the function of the Commissioners, under the act, was not
to make assessments upon abutting properties, nor to give notice t6 the property owners of such assessments, but to determine the question of the propriety and necessity of laying water
mains and pipes, and of erecting fire plugs and hydrants, and
that their bonaftde exercise of such a power cannot be reviewed
by the courts.
If, then, the reasoning and conclusions of these cases are to
be respected as establishing the law of the present case, it is
plain that it was within the power of Congress, by the act of
March 3, 1899, to order the opening and extension of the streets
in question, and to direct the Commissioners of the District to
institute and conduct proceedings in the Supreme Court of the
District to condemn the necessary land; and it was also competent for Congress, in said act, to provide that, of the amount
found due and awarded as damages for and in respect of the
land condemned for the opening of said streets, not less than
one half thereof should be assessed by the jury in said proceedings against the pieces and parcels of ground situate and lying
on each side of the extension of said streets, and also on all or
any adjacent pieces or parcels of land which will be benefited
by the opening of said streets as provided for in the said act,
and that the sums to be assessed against each lot or piece or
parcel of ground should be determined and designated by the
jury, and that, in determining what amount should be assessed
against any particular piece or parcel of ground, the jury should

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

take into consideration the situation of said lots and the benefits
that they might severally receive from the opening of said
streets.
It is also established by those authorities that, in proceedings
of this nature, notice by publication is sufficient; and it accordingly follows that the order of publication, in the newspapers
named, by the Supreme Court of the District gave due notice
of the filing of the petition and an opportunity to all persons
interested to show cause, if any they had, why the prayer of
the petition should not be granted. Such notice also must be
held to have operated as a notice to all concerned of the pending appointment of a jury, and that proceedings under the act
of Congress would subsequently be had. This gave an opportunity for interested parties to attend the meetings of the jury,
to adduce evidence, and be heard by counsel. The return of
the marshal shows that some, at least, of the property owners
appeared before the jury, produced witnesses, and were heard
by counsel. If the appellees did not avail themselves of these
opportunities, the court and jury, proceeding according to law,
were not to blame.
The record shows that, on September 19, 1899, the court
passed an order izsi confirming the verdict, award and assessment of benefits, unless cause to the contrary should be shown
on or before the 4th day of the following month, and directing
service of a copy of the order nisi on the owners of the land
condemned and on the owners of the land assessed in said verdict. It also appears that the appellees were served with this
copy, and that they accordingly filed exceptions to the finding
of the jury and to the confirmation of the award, on October 4,
1899.
On the 18th of November, 1899, after hearing, the Supreme
Court of the District passed a decree overruling the exceptions,
and confirming the verdict of award and assessments made by
the jury.
Upon the authorities heretofore cited it would therefore appear that the act of Congress of March 3, 1899, was a valid enactment, and that the proceedings thereunder were regular and
constituted due process of law, unless reasons for a different

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Opinion of the Court.

conclusion can be found in the opinion of the Court of Appeals,
which reversed the decree of the Supreme Court of the District,
and ordered the dismissal of the petition.
What, then, was the reasoning upon which the Court of Appeals proceeded? It was thus stated in the opinion:
"The principal questions raised by the assignments of error
are two, 1, that of the constitutionality of the act of Congress
under which the proceedings have been had; and, 2, that of
the sufficiency of the notice given to the appellants in respect
of the assessments upon their property.
"1. With respect to the first of these questions, we think
that it has been conclusively determined for us by the decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of NLrorwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269.
"As we understand that decision, which undoubtedly has
the effect of greatly qualifying the previous expressions of the
same high tribunal upon the matter of special assessments, the
limit of assessment on the private owner of property is the value
of the special benefit which has accrued to him from the public improvement adjacent to his property."
But we think that the Court of Appeals has not correctly apprised the decision in _rwowood v. Baker, and that, on examination, that decision and the reasoning on which it is founded
will not be found to be applicable to the case now before us.
That case came to this court on an appeal from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio,
wherein it had been held that for a municipality of a State to condemn land for a street through the property of a single owner,
and then assess back upon his abutting property the entire damages awarded, together with the costs and expenses of the condemnation proceedings, is to take private property without due
process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States. Baker v. Norwood, 74 Fed.
Rep. 997. In the opinion of this court it was said:
"The plaintiff's suit proceeded upon the ground, distinctly
stated, that the assessment in question was in, violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment providing that no State shall deprive
any person of property without due process of law, nor deny to

OCTOBER TERMT, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws, as well as of the bill of rights of the constitution of Ohio."
Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, 277.
It will, therefore, be perceived that there the court below and
this court were dealing with a question arising under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,
which, in terms, operates only to control action of the States,
and does not purport to extend to authority exercised by the
Government of the United States.
In the present case is involved the constitutionality of an act
of Congress regulating assessments on property in the District of
Columbia, and in respect to which the jurisdiction of Congress,
in matters municipal as well as political, is exclusive, and not
controlled by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
No doubt, in the exercise of such legislative powers, Congress is
subject to the provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provide, among other things,
that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for
public use without just compensation. But it by no means
necessarily follows that a long and consistent construction put
upon the Fifth Amendment, and maintaining the validity of
the acts of Congress relating to public improvements within
the District of Columbia, is to be deemed overruled by a decision concerning the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment as
controlling state legislation.
However, we need not pursue this suggestion, because we
think the Court of Appeals, in regarding the decision in Yorwood v. Baker as overruling our previous decisions in respect to
Congressional legislation in respect to public local improvements
in the District of Columbia, misconceived the meaning and effect
of that decision. There the question was as to the validity of a
village ordinance, which imposed the entire cost and expenses
of opening a street, irrespective of the question whether the
property was benefited by the opening of the street. The legislature of the State had not defined or designated the abutting
property as benefited by the improvement, nor had the village
authorities made any inquiry into the question of benefits.

WIGHT v. DAVIDSON.
Opinion of the Court.

There having been no legislative determination as to what lands
were benefited, no inquiry instituted by the village councils, and
no opportunity afforded to the abutting owner to be heard on
that subject, this court held that the exaction from the owner
of private property of the cost of a public improvement in substantial excess of the special benefits accruing to him is, to the
extent of such excess, a taking, under the guise of taxation,
of private property for public use without compensation, and
accordingly affirmed the decree of the Circuit Court of the
United States, which, while preventing the enforcement of
the particular assessment in question, left the village free to
make a new assessment upon the plaintiff's abutting property
for so much of the expense of opening the street as would be
found, upon due and proper inquiry, to be equal to the special
benefits accruing to the property.
That it was not intended by this decision to overrule Bauman
v. Ross, and Parsonsv. The Districtof Columbia is seen in the
opinion, where both those cases are cited, and declared not to
be inconsistent with the conclusion reached. Nrorwood v. Baker,
172 U. S. 269, 294. Special facts, showing an abuse or disregard of the law, resulting in an actual deprivation of property,
may give grounds for applying for relief to a court of equity;
and this was thought by a majority of this court to have been
the case in 2Trowood v. Baker. But no such facts are disclosed
in this record.
The second proposition upon which the Circuit Court proceeded was that sufficient notice had not been given in respect
of the assessments upon the property. This question, we think,
has been disposed of by previous decisions, and has been sufficiently discussed in a previous part of this opinion.
The decree of the Court of Apjpeals of the District of Columbia is reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions to affrm the decree of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia.

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
JUSTICES HAIRLA.N, WHITE and AECKENxNA, dissenting.

I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
of the District of Columbia should be affirmed.
Under the act of March 3, 1899, it was competent for the
jury, witlout 2,egard to special benefts, to put upon the lands
abutting upon each side of the streets authorized to be opened
and extended not less than one half of the entire damages found
due and awarded in respect of the property taken under the first
section of that act. It could only consider the question of benefits in respect to "adjacent" pieces or parcels of land. For
the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in French v. Barber
Asphalt Paving Company, I cannot agree that such a statutory
regulation or rule is consistent with the Constitution of the United States. My views upon the general subjects of special assessments are expressed in that opinion and need not be repeated
here.
The court in the present case says that Congress has exclusive jurisdiction, municipal and political, in the District of Columbia, and is not controlled by the Fourteenth Amendment,
although it is controlled by the Fifth Amendment providing,
among other things, that no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just coipensation. "But," the court proceeds, "it by no means necessarily
follows that a long and consistent construction put upon the
Fifth Amendment and maintaining the validity of acts of Congress relating to public improvements within the District or
Columbia, is to be deemed overruled by a decision concerning
the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment as controlling
legislation." These observations were made to sustain the
proposition that the principles announced in Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, in reference to the validity of state enactments relating to local public improvements, have no necessary
application to a case of a like kind arising under a similar act
of Congress relating to local public improvements in the District of Oolumbia. As the court does not pursue this subject,
nor express any final view upon the question referred to, I refer to this part of its opinion only for the purpose of recording my dissent from the intimation that what a State might

not do in respect of the deprivation of property without due
process of law, Congress under the Constitution of the United
States could, perhaps, do in respect of property in this District. The Fifth Amendment declares that no person shall be
deprived of property "without due process of law." The
Fourteenth Amendment declares that no State shall deprive
any person of property "without due process of law." It is
inconceivable to me that the question whether a person has
been deprived of his property without due process of law can
be determined upon principles applicable under the Fourteenth
Amendment but not applicable under the Fifth Amendment, or
upon principles applicable under the Fifth and not applicable
under the Fourteenth Amendment. It seems to me that the
words "due process of law" mean the same in both Amendments. The intimation to the contrary in the opinion of the
court is, I take leave to say, without any foundation upon
which to rest, and is most mischievous in its tendency.
The court withdraws this case from the rule established in
.Yorwood v. Baker upon the ground that the legislature of Ohio
"had not defined or designated the abutting property as beneBut this'is a mistake; for, as

that case, the State, by statute,

stated

had authorized villages to establish streets and highways and to
meet the cost of such improvements by special assessments on
the abutting property, according to frontage, without regard to
special benefits accruing to the property so assessed. And, to repeat what I have said in French v. Barber Asphalt Paving
Company, just decided, it was because and only because of this
rule, prescribed by the legislature,that the state enactment was
condemned as unconstitutional. The enactment, under which
the council of Norwood proceeded, put upon the abutting property, when the municipality proceeded under the front-foot rule,
the entire cost of opening a street; precluding, by a rule established for such cases, the owner of the property from showing
that the cost was in excess of special benefits and was confiscatory to the extent of such excess. Norwood v. Baker expressly
rejected the theory that the entire cost of a public highway, in
which the whole communitywas interested, could be put, under

legislative sanction, on the abutting property, where such cost
was in substantial excess of the special benefits accruing to the
property assessed.

The court, in this case, says that "special facts showing an
abuse or disregard of the law, resulting in an actual deprivation
of property, may give grounds for applying for relief to a court
of equity." What this means, when taken in connection with
what has been said and intimated by the court in French v.
Barber Asphalt Paving Co.-especially when considered in the
light of the broad declarations in other cited cases as to legislative power-I confess I am unable to say. What "special facts,"
in the case of special assessments to meet the cost of a public
improvement, would show an abuse of the law? What is meant
by the words "an actual deprivation of property?" If private
property abutting on a street be assessed for the cost of improving the street in excess of special benefits accruing to such property, is the assessment to the extent of the excess such an abuse
of the law or such an actual deprivation of property as would
justify the interference of a court of equity? In Norwood v.
Baker this question was answered in the affirmative. Whether
that doctrine is to remain the court does not distinctly say either
in the present case or in any of the cases relating to special assessments just determined.
I submit that if the present case is to be distinguished from
.forwood v. Baker, it should be done upon grounds that do not
involve a misapprehension of the scope and effect of the decision
in that case. If Congress can, by direct enactment, put a special assessment upon private property to meet the entire cost of
a public improvefnent made for the benefit and convenience of
the entire community, even if the amount so assessed be in
substantial excess of special benefits, and therefore, to the extent of such excess, confiscate private property for public use
without compensation, it should be declared in terms so clear
and definite as to teave no room for doubt as to what is intended.
