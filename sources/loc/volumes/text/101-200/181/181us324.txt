FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TIE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 498. Argued February 25, 26, 27, 1901.-Decided April 29, 1901.

In this case the court proceeds on the assumption that the legal import of
the phrase " due process of law" is the same both in the Fifth and in the
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and
that it cannot be supposed that it was intended by the Fourteenth Amendment to impose on the States, when exercising their powers of taxation,
any more rigid or stricter curb than that imposed on the Federal Government by the Fifth Amendment in a similar exercise of power.
It was not the intention of the Fourteenth Amendment to subvert the systerns of the States pertaining to general and special taxation: that Amendment legitimately operates to extend to the citizens and residents of the
States, the same protection against arbitrary state legislation, affecting
life, liberty and property, as is afforded by the Fifth Amendment against
similar legislation by Congress, and the Federal Courts ought not to interfere when what is complained of is the enforcement of the settled laws
of the State, applicable to all persons in like circumstances and conditions, but only when there is some abuse of law, amounting to confiscation of property, or deprivation of personal rights.
The conclusions reached by this court in many cases cited and summarized
by the court in its opinion are thus stated by two writers, (Cooley and
Dillon) whose views this court adopts: "The major part of the cost of
a local work is sometimes collected by general tax, while a smaller portion is levied upon the estates specially benefited. The major part is
sometimes assessed on estates benefited, while the general public is taxed
a smaller portion in consideration of a smaller participation in the benefits. The whole cost in other cases is levied on lands in the immediate
vicinity of the work. In a constitutional point of view, either of these
methods is admissible, and one may sometimes be just, and another
at other times. In other cases it may be deemed reasonable to make the
whole cost a general charge, and levy no special assessment whatever.
The question is legislative, and, like all legislative questions, may be
decided erroneously; but it is reasonable to expect that, with such latitude of choice, the tax will be more just and equal than it would be were
the legislature required to levy it by one inflexible and arbitrary rule."
"The courts are very generally agreed that the authority to require the
property specially benefited, to bear the expense of local improvements

is a branch of the taxing power, or included within it..

eral treasury, or be assessed upon the abutting or other property specially benefited, and, if in the latter mode, whether the assessment shall
be upon all property found to be benefited, or alone upon the abuttors,
according to frontage or according to the area of their lots, is, according
to the present weight of authority, considered to be a question of legislative expediency."
Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, considered, and held not to be inconsistent
with these views.

Tuis was a suit instituted in the circuit court of Jackson
County, Missouri, by the Barber Asphalt Paving Company, a
corporation whose business it was to construct pavements coinposed of asphalt, against Margaret French and others, owners
of lots abutting on Forest avenue in Kansas City, for the purpose of enforcing the lien of a tax bill issued by that city in
part payment of the cost of paving said avenue.
The work was done conformably to the requirements of the
Kansas City charter, by the adoption of a resolution by the
common council of the city declaring the work of paving the
street, and with a pavement of a defined character, to be necessary, which resolution was first recommended by the board of
public works of the city. This resolution was thereupon published for ten days in the newspaper doing the city printing.
Thereafter the owners of a majority of front feet on that part
of the street to be improved had the right, under the charter,
within thirty days after the first day of the publication of the
resolution, to file a remonstrance with the city clerk against
the proposed improvement, and thereby to divest the common
council of the power to make the improvement, and such property owners had the right, by filing within the same period a
petition so to do, to have such street improved with a different
kind of material or in a different manner from that specified in
such resolution. In this instance neither such a remonstrance
nor petition was filed, and the common council, upon the recommendation of the board of public works, enacted an ordinance
requiring the construction of the pavement. The charter requires that a contract for such work shall be let to the lowest
and best bidder. Thereupon bids for the work were duly advertised for, and the plaintiff company, being the lo est and best

Statement of the Case.

bidder therefor, a contract was, on July 31, 1894, entered into
between Kansas City and the plaintiff for the construction of
said pavement.
The contract expressly provided that the work should be paid
for by the issuance of special tax bills, according to the provisions of the Kansas City charter, and that the city should not
in any event be liable for or on account of the work. The cost
of the pavement was apportioned and charged against the lots
fronting thereon according to the method prescribed by the
charter, which is that the total cost of the work shall be apportioned and charged against the lands abutting thereon according to the frontage of the several lots or tracts of land abutting
on the improvement. The charge against each lot or tract of
land was evidenced by a tax bill. The tax bill representing
the assessment against each lot was, by the charter, made a
lien upon the tract of land against which it was issued, and was
_vrimafacie evidence of the validity of the charge represented
by it. Such lien can be enforced only by suit in a court of
competent jurisdiction, against the owners of the land charged.
lNo personal judgment was authorized to be rendered against
the owner of the land. The right was expressly conferred on
the owner of reducing the amount of the recovery by pleading
and proving any mistake or error in the amount of the bill, or
that the work was not done in a good and workmanlike manner.
The defendants pleaded and contended that the contract offered in evidence was a contract to construct the pavement and
maintain and keep the street in repair for five years, and was contrary to the charter of Kansas City, void and of no effect; and
that the charter of Kansas City purports to authorize the paving
of streets and to authorize special tax bills therefor, charging
the cost thereof on the abutting property according to the frontage, without reference to any benefits to the property on which
the charge was made and the special tax bills levied, and that
such method of apportioning and charging the cost of the pavement was contrary to and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
The judgment of the circuit court of Jackson County was for
the plaintiff company for the amount due on the tax bill and

for the enforcement of the lien. From this judgment an appeal
was taken to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and, on November 13, 1900, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed,
and thereupon a writ of error from this court was allowed.

MR.JUSTICE SHIRAS, after stating the case, delivered the opin-

ion of the court.
In its opinion in this case the Supreme Court of Missouri said
that "the method adopted in the charter and ordinance of
Kansas City of charging the cost of paving Forest avenue against
the adjoining lots according to their frontage had been repeatedly authorized by the legislature of Missouri, and such laws
had received the sanction of this court in many decisions. St.
Louis v. Allen, 53 Mo. 44; St. Joseph v. Anthony, 30 Mo. 537;
NAecnan v. Smith, 50 Mo. 525; Kiley v. Cranor, 51 Mo. 541;
Buthe ford v. Hamilton, 97 Mo. 543; -oberly v. Hogan, 131
Mo. 19; Farrarv. St. Louis, 80 Mo. 379."
In the last-mentioned case Judge iNorton for the court said:
"The liability of lots fronting on a street, the paving of which
is authorized to be charged with the cost of the work according
to their frontage, having been thus so repeatedly asserted, the
question is no longer an open one in this State, and we are relieved from the necessity of examining authorities cited by the
counsel for plaintiff in error condemning what is familiarly
known as the front-foot rule.
"Learned counsel for defendant concede such was the decided
law of this State, and that the portion of the Kansas City charter known as the ninth article of the charter, which authorizes
the cost of a pavement to be assessed against the lots now fronting on the improvement according to their respective frontage,
was framed after this court had fully considered and construed

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

similar laws and sustained them against the charge of unconstitutionality, and the assessment now challenged was made
under the construction given by this court."
Accordingly the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the
assessment in question was valid, and the tax imposed collectible. And, in so far as the constitution and laws of Missouri
are concerned, this court is, of course, bound by that decision.
But that court also held, against the contention of the lot
owners, that the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States were not applicable in the
case; and our jurisdiction enables us to inquire whether the
Supreme Court of Missouri were in error in so holding.
The question thus raised has been so often and so carefully
discussed, both in the decisions of this court and of the state
courts, that we do not deem it necessary to again enter upon a
consideration of the nature and extent of the taxing power, nor
to attempt to discover and define the limitations upon that
power that may be found in constitutional principles. It will
be sufficient for our present purpose to collate our previous decisions and to apply the conclusions reached therein to the present case.
It may prevent confusion, and relieve from repetition, if we
point out that some of our cases arose under the provisions of
the Fifth and others under those of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States. While the language
of those amendments is the same, yet as they were engrafted
upon the Constitution at different times and in widely different
circumstances of our national life, it may be that questions may
arise in which different constructions and applications of their
provisions may be proper. SlavghterHouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36,

Thus it was said, in Davidson v. 1'ew Orleans, 96 U. S. 97,
103:
"It is not a little remarkable that while this provision has
been in the Constitution of the United States, as a restraint
upon the authority of the Federal government, for nearly a century, and while, during all that time, the manner in which the
powers of that government have been exercised has been watched

Opinion of the Court.

with jealousy, and subjected to the most rigid criticism in all
its branches, this special limitation upon its powers has rarely
been invoked in the judicial forum or the more enlarged theatre
of public discussion. But while it has been a part of the Constitution, as a restraint upon the power of the States, only a
very few years, the docket of this court is crowded with cases
in which we are asked to hold that state courts and state legislatures have deprived their own citizens of life, liberty or property without due process of law. There is here abundant evidence that there exists some strange misconception of the scope
of this provision as found in the Fourteenth Amendment. In
fact, it would seem, from the character of many of the cases
before us, and the arguments made in them that the clause
under consideration is looked upon as a means of bringing to
the test of the decision of this court the abstract opinion of
every unsuccessful litigant in a state court of the justice of the
decision against him, and of the merits of the legislation on
which such a decision may be founded."
However, we shall not attempt to define what it is for a State
to deprive a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, in terms which would cover every exercise of power
thus forbidden to the State, and exclude those which are not,
but shall proceed, in the present case, on the assumption that
the legal import of the phrase "due process of law" is the same
in both Amendments. Certainly, it cannot be supposed that, by
the Fourteenth Amendment, it was intended to impose on the
States, when exercising their powers of taxation, any more rigid
or stricter curb than that imposed on the Federal government,
in a similar exercise of power, by the Fifth Amendment.
Let us, then, inquire, as briefly as possible, what has been
decided by this court as to the scope and effect of the phrase
"due process of law," as applied to legislative power.
One of the earliest cases, in which was examined the historical
and legal meaning of those words, is .Murray'sLessee v. Hoboken. and Company, 18 How. 272. The question involved was
the validity of a sale of real estate made under a distress warrant, authorized by a statute of the United States, 3 Stat. 592,
c. 107, against a defaulting collector of customs. It was con-

Opinion of the Court.

tended that such a proceeding deprived the owner of property
without due process of law, contrary to the Fifth Amendment,
that by "process of law" was meant a charge, defence, judgment before and by a legally constituted court. The question
was thus stated by Mr. Justice Curtis:
"That the warrant now in question is legal process is not
denied. It was issued in conformity with an act of Congress.
But is it 'due process of law?,' The Constitution contains no
description of those processes which it was intended to allow or
forbid. it does not even declare what principles are to bo applied to ascertain whether it be due process. It is manifest that
it was not left to the legislative power to enact any process
which might be devised. The article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the
government, and cannot be so construed as to leave Congress
free to make any process ' due process of law' by its mere will.
To what principles, then, are we to resort to ascertain whether
this process, enacted by Congress, is due process? To this the
answer must be twofold. We must examine the Constitution
itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its
provisions. If not found to be so, we must look to those settled
usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and
statute law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors,
and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil
and political condition by having been acted on by them after
the settlement of this country."
Pursuing the lines of inquiry thus indicated, the court reached
the conclusions that, in ascertaining and enforcing payment of
taxes and of balances due from receivers of the revenue in England, the methods have varied widely from the usual course of
the common law on other subjects, and that, as respects such
debts, the "law of the land" authorized the employment of
auditors, and an inquisition without notice, and a species of examination bearing a very close resemblance to the warrant of
distress in the act of -Congress in question ; that this diversity
in the law of the land between revenue defaulters and ordinary
debtors was understood in this country, and entered into the
legislation of the colonies and provinces, and more especially

Opinion of the Court.

of the States, after the Declaration of Independence and before
the formation of the Constitution of the United States; that
not only was the process of distress in nearly or quite universal
use for the collection of taxes, but what was generally termed
a warrant of distress, running against the body, goods and
chattels of defaulting receivers of public money, was issued to
some public officer, to whom was committed the power to ascertain the amount of the default, and by such warrant proceed
to collect it; and that, accordingly, the distress warrant in
question was not inconsistent with that part of the Constitution which prohibits a citizen from being deprived of his property without due process of law.
In IMalker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90, there was presented the
question whether the Fourteenth Amendment availed to secure
to a citizen of Louisiana a right of trial by jury as against an
act of that State which provided that, in certain circumstances,
a case enforcing penalties should be tried by the judge; and it
was held that "the States, so far as this amendment is concerned,
are left to regulate trials in their own courts in their own way.
A trial by jury in suits of common law pending in the state
courts is not, therefore, a privilege or immunity of national
citizenship which the States are forbidden by the Fourteenth
Amendment to abridge. A State cannot deprive a person of
his property without due process of law, but this does not
necessarily imply that all trials in the state courts affecting the
property of persons must be by jury. This requirement of the
Constitution is met if the trial is had according to the settled
course of judicial proceedings. .lurray's -Lessee v. Hoboken
Zand Co., 18 How. 272, 280. Due process of law is process according to the law of the land. This process in the States is regulated by the law of the State. Our power over that law is only
to determine whether it is in conflict with the supreme law of
the land-that is to say, with the Constitution and laws of the
United States made in pursuance thereof-or with any treaty
made under the authority of the United States. Here the
state court has decided that the proceeding below was in accordance with the law of the State; and we do not find that
to be contrary to the Constitution or any law or treaty of the
United States."

.c'E.illen v. Anderson, 95 U. S. 37, 41, was a case wherein
was involved the validity of a law of the State of Louisiana,
whereby a tax collector was authorized to seize property and
sell it in order to enforce payment of a license tax, and which
was alleged to be opposed to the provision of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution which declares that no State
shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due
process of law; but it was said by this court:
"Looking at the Louisiana statute here assailed, we feel bound
to say that if it is void on the ground assumed the revenue laws
of nearly all the States will be found void for the same reason.
The mode of assessing taxes in the States, by the Federal government, and by all governments, is necessarily summary, that
it may be speedy and effectual. By summary is not meant
arbitrary, or unequal, or illegal. It must, under our Constitution, be lawfully done. But that does not mean, nor does the
phrase ' due process of law' mean, by a judicial proceeding. The
nation from whom we inherit the phrase ' due process of law'
has never relied upon courts of justice for the collection of her
taxes, though she passed through a successful revolution in resistance to unlawful taxation. We need not here go into the
literature of that constitutional provision, because in any view
that can be taken of it the statute under consideration does not
violate it. It enacts that, when any person shall refuse or fail
to pay his license tax, the collector shall give ten days' written
or printed notice to the delinquent requiring its payment, and
the manner of giving this notice is fully prescribed. If at the
expiration of this time the license be not fully paid, the tax collector may, without judicial formality, proceed to seize and sell,
after ten days' advertisement, the property of the delinquent or
so much as may be necessary to pay the tax and costs. . . .
Here is a notice that the party is assessed, by the proper officer,
for a given sum as a tax of a certain kind, and ten days' time
given him to pay it. Is not this a legal mode of proceeding
It seems to be supposed that it is essential to the validity of this
tax that the party charged should have been present, or had an
opportunity to be present, in some tribunal when he was assessed.
But this is not, and never has been, considered necessary to the

Opinion of the Court

validity of a tax. And the fact that most of the States now
have boards of revisors of tax assessments does not prove that
taxes levied without them are void."
Davidon v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, was a case wherein an
assessment of certain real estate in New Orleans for draining
the swamps of that city was resisted in the state courts, and
was by writ of error brought to this court on the ground that
the proceeding deprived the owner of his property without due
process of law. The origin and history of this provision of the
Constitution, as found in Magna Charta, and in the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, were again considered; the cases of .iuoray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co., 18
How. 272, and .Ac.Aillen v. Anderson, 95 U. S. 37, were cited
and approved; and it was held that "neither the corporate
agency by which the work was done, the excessive price which
the statute allowed therefore, nor the relative importance of the
work to the value of the land assessed, nor the fact that the assessment was made before the work was done, nor that the assessment is unequal as regards the benefits conferred, nor that
personal judgments are rendered for the amount assessed, are
matters in which the state authorities are controlled by the Federal Constitution."
In Sfringer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, was involved the
validity of an act of Congress, June 30, 1864, c. 172, 13 Stat.
218, whereby lands of A were distrained and sold by reason of
his refusal to pay a tax assessed against him, and it was contended that the sale of defendant's real estate, to satisfy the tax
assessed upon him, in a summary manner, without first having
obtained a judgment in a court of law, was a proceeding to deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law;
that by "due process of law" is meant law in its regular course
of administration by the courts of justice, and not the execution
of a power vested in ministerial officers. But this court, after
citing furray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co., as holding that an
act of Congress authorizing a warrant to issue, without oath,
against a public debtor, for the seizure of his property, was valid,
and that the proceeding was "due process of law," said:
"The prompt payment of taxes is always important to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

public welfare. It may be vital to the existence of a government. The idea that every taxpayer is entitled to the delays
of litigation is unreasonable. If the laws liere in question involved any wrong or unnecessary harshness, it was for Congress,
or the people who make congresses, to see that the evil was corrected. The remedy does not lie with the judicial branch of the
government."
In 2Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22, the Fourteenth Amendment was invoked to invalidate legislation of the State of Missouri, regulating the right of appeal and of writs of error, and
whereby suitors in the courts of St. Louis and certain other
named counties were denied the right of appeal to the Supreme
Court of Missouri in cases where it gave that right to suitors in
the courts of the other counties of the State. Speaking for the
court, Mr. Justice Bradley said:
"If this position is correct, the Fourteenth Amendment has
a much more far-reaching effect than has been supposed. It
would render invalid all limitations of jurisdiction based on the
amount or character of the demand. A party having a claim
for only five dollars could with equal propriety complain that
he is deprived of a right enjoyed by other citizens, because he
cannot prosecute it in the superior courts; and another might
equally complain that he cannot bring a suit for real estate in a
justice's court, where the expense is small and the proceedings
are expeditious. There is no difference in principle between
such discriminations as these in the jurisdiction of courts and
that which the plaintiff in error complains of in the present
case.
"If, however, we take into view the general objects and purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, we shall find no reasonable ground for giving it any such application. These are to
extend United States citizenship to all natives and naturalized
persons, and to prohibit the States from abridging their privileges and immunities, and from depriving any person of life,
liberty or property without due process of law, and from denying to any person within their jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws. It contemplates persons and classes of persons.
It has not respect to local and municipal regulations that do

Opinion of the Court.

not injuriously affect or discriminate between persons and classes
of persons within the places or municipalities for which such
regulations are made. The amendment could never have been
intended to prevent a State from arranging and parcelling out
the jurisdiction of its several courts at its discretion . ..
Each State has the right to make political subdivisions of its
territory for municipal purposes, and to regulate their local
government.

.

.

.

If every person residing or being in

either portion of the State should be accorded the equal protection of the laws prevailing there, he could not justly complain
of a violation of the clause referred to. For, as before said, it
has respect to persons and classes of persons. It means that no
person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection
of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes
in the same place and in like circumstances. The Fourteenth
Amendment does not profess to secure to all persons in the
United States the benefit of the same laws and the same remedies. Great diversities in these respects may exist in two States
separated only by an imaginary line."
In Mattingly v. District of Columbia, 97 U. S.687, 692, there
was called in question the validity of the act of Congress of
June 19, 1878, 20 Stat. 166, c. 309, entitled "An act to provide
for the revision and correction of assessments for special improvements in the District of Columbia and for other purposes,"
and it was said by this court, through Mr. Justice Strong:
"It may be that the burden laid upon the property of the coinplainants is onerous. Special assessments for special road or
street improvements very often are oppressive. But that the
legislative power may authorize them, and may direct them to
be made in proportion to the frontage, area or market value of
the adjoining property, at its discretion, is, under the decisions,
no longer an open question."
In Kelly v. Pittsburgh, 104 U. S.78, it was urged that land
which the owner had not laid off into town lots, but occupied
for agricultural purposes, and through which no streets are run
or used, cannot be, even by the legislature, subjected to the
taxes of a city-the water tax, the gas tax, the street tax and
others of similar character. The reason for this was said to be

OCTOBER TERM. 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

that such taxes are for the benefit of those in a city who own
property within the limits of such improvements, and who use
or might use them if they choose, while he reaps no such benefit. Cases were cited from the higher courts of Kentucky and
Iowa where this principle was asserted, and where those courts
have held that farm lands in the city are not subject to the
ordinary city taxes. But this court said:
"It is no part of our duty to inquire into the grounds on
which those courts have so decided. They are questions which
arise between the citizens of those States and their own city
authorities, and afford no rule for construing the Constitution
of the United States.

.

.

.

The main argument for the

plaintiff in error-the only one to which we can listen-is that
the proceeding in regard to the taxes assessed on his land deprives him of his property without due process of law.
"It is not asserted that, in the methods by which the value
of his land was ascertained for the purpose of this taxation,
there was any departure from the usual modes of assessment,
nor that the manner of apportioning and collecting the tax
was unusual or materially different from that in force in all
communities where land is subject to taxation. In these respects there is no charge that the method pursued is not due
process of law. Taxes have not, as a general rule, in this
country since its independence, nor in England before that
time, been collected by regular judicial proceedings. The neces.
sities of government, the nature of the duty to be performed,
and the customary usages of the people, have established a different procedure, which, in regard to that matter, is and always has
been due process of law. The tax in question was assessed and
the proper officers were proceeding to collect it in this way.
The distinct ground on which this provision of the Constitution
of the United States is invoked is that as the land in question
is, and always has been, used as farm land, for agricultural purposes only, subjecting it to taxation for ordinary city purposes
deprives the plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law. It is alleged, and probably with truth, that the
estimate of the value of the land for taxation is very greatly in
excess of its true value. Whether this be true or not we can-

not here inquire. We have so often decided that we cannot review and correct the errors and mistakes of the state tribunals
on that subject, that it is only necessary to refer to those decisions, without a restatement of the argument on which they
rest. State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575; Kennard v.
Louisiana, 92 U. S. 480; .Davidson v. 2Vew Orleans, 96 U. S.
97; Kirtland v. Hfotehkiss, 100 U. S. 491; AMissouri v. Lewis,
101 U. S. 22; National Bank v. Kimball, 103 U. S. 732."
In Spencer v. .Merchant, 125 U. S. 345, a judgment of the
Court of Appeals of the State of New York, upholding the
validity of an assessment upon lands to cover the expense of
a local improvement, was brought to this court for review
upon the allegation that the state statute was unconstitutional.
In the opinion of this court, delivered by Mr. Justice Gray,
the following extract was given from the opinion of the Court
of Appeals:
"The act of 1881 determines absolutely and conclusively
the amount of the tax to be raised, and the property to be assessed and upon which it is to be apportioned. Each of these
things was within the power of the legislature, whose action
cannot be reviewed in the courts upon the ground that it acted
unjustly or without appropriate and adequate reason. The
legislature may commit the ascertainment of the sum to be
raised and of the benefited district to commissioners, but it is not
bound to do so, and may settle both questions for itself; and
when it does so, its action is necessarily conclusive and beyond
review. Here an improvement has been ordered and made,
the expense of which might justly have been imposed upon adjacent property benefited by the change. By the act of 1881
the legislature imposes the unpaid portion of the cost and expense, with the interest thereon, upon that portion of the property benefited which has thus far borne none of the burden.
In so doing, it necessarily determines two things, viz., the
amount to be realized, and the property especially benefited by
the expenditure of the amount. The lands might have been
benefited by the improvement, and so the legislative determination that they were, and to what amount or proportion of the
cost, even if it may have been mistakingly unjust, is not open

to our review. The question of special benefit and the property to which it extends is of necessity a question of fact, and
when the legislature determines it in a case within its general
power, its decision must of course be final. We can see in the
determination reached possible sources of error and perhaps
even of injustice, but we are not at liberty to say that the tax
on the property covered by the law of 1881 was imposed without reference to special benefits. The legislature practically
determined that the lands described in that act were peculiarly
benefited by the improvement to a certain specified amount
which constituted a just proportion of the whole cost and expense; and while it may be that the process by which the result was reached was not the best attainable, and some other
might have been more accurate and just, we cannot for that
reason question an enactment within the general legislative
power.

The precise wrong of which complaint is made

appears to be that the land owners now assessed never had an
opportunity to be heard as to the original apportionment, and
find themselves now practically bound by it as between their
lots and those of the owners who paid. But that objection becomes a criticism upon the action of the legislature and the
process by which it determined the amount to be raised and
the property to be assessed. Unless by special permission, that
is a hearing never granted in the process of taxation. The
legislature determines expenditures and amounts to be raised
for their payment, the whole discussion and all questions of
prudence and propriety and justice being confided to its jurisdiction. It may err, but courts cannot review its discretion.
In this case, it kept within its power when it fixed, first, the
amount to be raised to discharge the improvement debt incurred
by its direction; and, second, when it designated the lots and
property, which in its judgment, by reason of special benefits,
should bear the burden; and having the power, we cannot criticise the reasons or manner of its action."
This definition of legislative power was approved by this
court, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.

tion than the general prohibition against taking property without due process of law, the legislature of the State, having the
power to fix the sum necessary to be levied for the expense of
a public improvement, and to order it to be assessed, either, like
other taxes, upon property generally, or only upon the lands
benefited by the improvement, is authorized to determine both
the amount of the whole tax, and the class of lands which will
receive the benefit and should therefore bear the burden, although it may, if it sees fit, commit the ascertainment of
either or both of these facts to the judgment of commissioners. When the determination of the lands to be benefited is
entrusted to commissioners, the owners may be entitled to notice and hearing upon the question whether their lands are
benefited and how much. But the legislature has the power
to determine, by the statute imposing the tax, what lands,
which might be benefited by the improvement, are in fact
benefited; and if it does so, its determination is conclusive
upon the owners and the courts, and the owners have no right
to be heard upon the question whether their lands are benefited
or not, but only upon the validity of the assessment, and its apportionment among the different parcels of the class which the
legislature has conclusively determined to be benefited. In determining what lands are benefited by the improvement, the
legislature may avail itself of such information as it deems
sufficient, either through investigations by its committees, or
by adopting as its own the estimates or conclusions of others,
whether those estimates or conclusions previously had or had
not any legal sanction."

of a city ordinance, providing that the cost of a sewer should
be distributed upon the property within the sewer district, and
appointing viewers to estimate the proportionate share which
each piece of property should bear, was questioned, because the
ordinance contained no provision for notice, it was held by the
Supreme Court of Oregon, and by this court on error, that notice by publication is a sufficient notice in proceedings of this
nature, and that as the viewers, upon their appointment, gave

the proceedings within "due process of law."
Dist'ict v. Breadley, 16-1 U. S. 112,
In Fallbrook ,rigation
was involved the validity of the irrigation act enacted by the
legislature of the State of California. One of the objections
urged against the act was that it permitted the whole cost to
be levied by a board of directors of the district upon all of the
real estate of the district according to value, with no reference
to the degree of benefit conferred. As to this it was said by
this court, through Mr. Justice Peckham:
"Assuming for the purpose of this objection that the owner
of these lands had by the provisions of the act, and before the
lands were finally included in the district, an opportunity to be
heard before a proper tribunal upon the question of benelits,
we are of opinion that the decisions of such a tribunal, in the
absence of actual fraud and bad faith, would be, so far as this
court is concerned, conclusive upon that question. It cannot
be that upon a question of fact of such a nature this court has
the power to review the decision of the state tribunal which
has been pronounced under a statute providing for a hearing
upon notice. The erroneous decision of such a question of fact
violates no constitutional provision." Citing Spene'r v. _1,reltant, 125 U. S. 345.
Another objection to the validity of the act was the total
want of an opportunity to be heard on the question of the expediency of forming the district, on the questions of cost and of
benefits received. In respect to this it was said:
"The provision for a hearing in the irrigation act with a condition that lands which in the judgment of the board are not
benefited shall not be included, renders the determination of the
board, including them after a hearing, a judgment that such
lands will be benefited by the proposed plan of irrigation.
"The publication of a notice of the proposed presentation of
the petition is a sufficient notification to those interested in the
question and gives them an opportunity to be heard before the
board. Hager v. Reclamation District, 111 U. S. 701; 'ent v.

to fix such a district for itself without any hearing as to benefits,
for the purpose of assessing upon the lands within the district
the cost of a local, public improvement. The legislature, when
it fixes the district itself, is supposed to have made proper inquiry, and to have finally and conclusively determined the fact
of benefits to the land included in the district, and the citizen
has no constitutional right to any other or further hearing upon
that question. The right which he thereafter has is to a hearing
upon the question of what is termed the apportionment of the
tax, i. e., the amount of the tax which he is to pay. Paulsenv.
Portland,149 U S. 30, 41. But when as in this case the determination of the question of what lands shall be included in the
district is only to be decided after a decision as to what lands
described in the petition will be benefited, and the decision of
that question is submitted to some tribunal, (the board of supervisors in this case,) the parties whose lands are thus included in
the petition are entitled to a hearing upon the question of benefits, and to have the lands excluded if the judgment of the board
be against their being benefited.
"Unless the legislature decide the question of benefits itself,
the land owner has the right to be heard upon that question
before his property can be taken. This, in substance, was determined by the decisions of this court in Spencer v. Merchant,
125 U. S. 356, and Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578."
In Baurnan v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, on appeal from the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it was held that Congress may direct that, when part of a parcel of land is appropriated to the public use for a highway in the District of
Columbia, the tribunal vested by law with the duty of assessing
the compensation or damages due to the owner, whether for
the value of the part taken, or for any injury to the rest, shall
take into consideration, by way of lessening the whole or either
part of the sum due him, any special and direct benefits, capable
of present estimate and reasonable computation, caused by the
establishment of the highway to the part not taken; that the
estimate of the just compensation for property taken for the
public use, under the right of eminent domain, is not required
to be made by a jury, but may be entrusted to commissioners

Opinion of the Court.

appointed by a court, or to an inquest consisting of more or
fewer men than an ordinary jury; that Congress, in the exercise
of the right of taxation in the District of Columbia, may direct
that half of the amount of the compensation or damages awarded
to the owners of lands appropriated to the public use for a highway shall be assessed and charged upon the District of Columbia, and the other half upon the lands benefited thereby within
the District, in proportion to the benefit; and may commit the
ascertainment of the lands to be assessed, and the apportionment of the benefits among them, to the same tribunal which
assesses the compensation or damages; that if the legislature,
in taxing lands benefited by a highway, or other public improvement, makes provision for notice, by publication or otherwise,
to each owner of land, and for hearing him, at some stage of
the proceedings, upon the question what proportion of the tax
shall be assessed upon his land, his property is not taken without due process of law.
In the opinion of the court in that case, delivered by Mr.
Justice. Gray, it was said that the provisions of the statute under consideration, which regulated the assessment of damages,
are to be referred, not to the right of eminent domain, but to
the right of taxation, and that the legislature, in the exercise
of the right of taxation, has the authority to direct the whole,
or such part as it may prescribe, of the expense of a public improvement, such as the establishing, the widening, the grading
or the repair of a street, to be assessed upon the owners of lands
benefited thereby; and that such authority has been repeatedly
exercised in the District of Columbia by Congress, with the
sanction of this court-citing Tillard v. Presbury,14 Wall.
676; fattingly v. District of Columbia, 97 U. S. 687; Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282, 302. It was also said
that the class of lands to be assessed for the purpose may be
either determined by the legislature itself, by defining a territorial district, or by other designation; or it may be left by the
legislature to the determination of commissioners, and be made
to consist of such lands, and such only, as the commissioners
shall decide to be benefited; that the rule of apportionment
among the parcels of land benefited also rests within the dis-

Opinion of the Court.

cretion of the legislature, and may be directed to be in proportion to the position, the frontage, the area or the market value
of the lands, or in proportion to the benefits as estimated by
commissioners.
This subject has been recently considered by this court in
the case of Parsons v. District of Columbia, 170 U. S. 45, and
it was there held, after a review of the authorities, that the
enactment by Congress that assessments levied for laying water
mains in the District of Columbia should be at the rate of $1.25
per linear foot front against all lots or land abutting on the
street, road or alley, in which a watermain shall be laid, was
constitutional, and was conclusive alike of the necessity of the
work and of its benefit as against abutting property.
We do not deem it necessary to extend this opinion by referring
to the many cases in the state courts, in which the principles
of the foregoing cases have been approved and applied. It will
be sufficient to state the conclusions reached, after a review of
the state decisions, by two text-writers of high authority for
learning and accuracy:
"The major part of the cost of a local work is sometimes
collected by general tax, while a smaller portion is levied upon
the estates specially benefited.
"The major part is sometimes assessed on estates benefited,
while the general public is taxed a smaller portion in consideration of a smaller participation in the benefits.
"The whole cost in other cases is levied on lands in the immediate vicinity of the work.
"In a constitutional point of view, either of these methods
is admissible, and one may sometimes be just and another at
other times. In other cases it may be deemed reasonable to
make the whole cost a general charge, and levy no special assessment whatever. The question is legislative, and, like all
legislative questions, may be decided erroneously; but it is
reasonable to expect that, with such latitude of choice, the tax
will be more just and equal than it would be were the legislature required to levy it by one inflexible and arbitrary rule."
Cooley on Taxation, 447.

provements shall be paid out of the general treasury, or be assessed upon the abutting or other property specially benefited,
and, if in the latter mode, whether the assessment shall be upon
all property found to be benefited, or alone upon the abutters,
according to frontage or according to the area of their lots, is
according to the present weight of authority considered to be a
question of legislative expediency." Dillon's Municipal Corporations, vol. 2, § 752, 4th ed.
This array of authority was confronted, in the courts below,
with the decision of this court in the case of NAorwood v. Baker,
172 U. S. 269, which was claimed to overrule our previous cases,
and to establish the principle that the cost of a local improvement cannot be assessed against abutting property according
to frontage, unless the law, under which the improvement is
made, provides for a preliminary hearing as to the benefits to
be derived by the property to be assessed.
But we agree with the Supreme Court of Missouri in its view
that such is not the necessary legal import of the decision in
Ntorwood v. Baker. That was a case where by a village ordinance, apparently aimed at a single person, a portion of whose
property was condemned for a street, the entire cost of opening the street, including not only the full amount paid for the
strip condemned, but the costs and expenses of the condemnation proceedings, was thrown upon the abutting property of
the person whose land was condemned. This appeared, both
to the court below and to a majority of the judges of this court,
to be an abuse of the law, an act of confiscation, and not a valid
exercise of the taxing power. This court, however, did not
affirm the decree of the trial court awarding a perpetual injunction against the making and collection of any special assessments upon Mrs. Baker's property, but said:
"It should be observed that the decree did not relieve the
abutting property from liability for such amount as could be
properly assessed against it. Its legal effect, as we now adjudge, was only to prevent the enforcement of the particular

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

assessment in question. It left the village, in its discretion, to
take such steps as were within its power to take, either under
existing statutes or under any authority that might thereafter
be conferred upon it, to make a -new assessment upon the plaintiff's abutting property for so much of the expense of the opening of the street as was found upon due and proper inquiry to
be equal to the special benefits accruing to the property. By
the decree rendered the court avoided the performance of functions appertaining to an assessing tribunal or body, and left the
subject under the control of the local authorities designated by
the State."
That this decision did not go to the extent claimed by the
plaintiff in error in this case is evident, because in the opinion
of the majority it is expressly said that the decision was not
inconsistent with our decisions in Parsons v. District of Columbia, 170 U. S. 45, 56, and in 8pen-er v. .Merchant,125 U. S.
345, 357.
It may be conceded that courts of equity are always open to
afford a remedy where there is an attempt, under the guise of
legal proceedings, to deprive a person of his life, liberty or property, without due process of law. And such, in the opinion of
a majority of the judges of this court, was the nature and effect of the proceedings in the case of Norwood v. Baker.
But there is no such a state of facts in the present case.
Those facts are thus stated by the court of Missouri:
"The work done consisted of paving with asphaltum the
roadway of Forest avenue in Kansas City, thirty-six feet in
width, from Independence avenue to Twelfth street, a distance
of one half a mile. Forest avenue is one of the oldest and best
improved residence streets in the city, and all of the lots abutting thereon front the street and extend back therefrom uniformly to the depth of an ordinary city lot to an alley. The
lots are all improved and used for residence purposes, and all
of the lots are substantially on the grade of the street as improved,
and are similarly situated with respect to the asphalt pavement.
The structure of the pavement along its entire extent is uniform
in distance and quality. There is no showing that there is any
difference in the value of any of the lots abutting on the improvement."

(with whom concurred MR. JusTIoE

WrriTn and MR. JusTicE MoKENNA,) dissenting.
The special tax bills here in question purport to cover the cost
of paving with asphalt a part of Forest avenue in Kansas City,
Missouri. The work was done under the orders of the common
council of that city, and the tax bills, it is alleged, were made
out in conformity with the provisions of the city charter.
By section two of article nine of the city charter it was provided that "the city shall have power to cause to be graded,
regraded, constructed, reconstructed, paved, repaved, blocked,
reblocked, graveled, regraveled, macadamized, remacadamized,
curbed, recurbed, guttered, reguttered, or otherwise improved
or repaired, all streets, alleys, sidewalks, avenues, public highways and parts thereof, . . . and to pay therefor out of the
general fund or by issuing . pecial tax bills as herein mentioned.

"

The same section provides that no resolution for the paving,
repaving, etc., of any street, alley, avenue, public highway or
part thereof "shall be passed by the common council except
upon recommendation of the board of public works indorsed
thereon; and provided further, that if the resident owners of the
city who own a majority in front feet of all the lands belonging
to such residents and fronting on the street, alley, avenue, public highway or part thereof to be improved shall, within thirty
days after the first day of the publication of such resolution, file
with the board of public works a petition, signed by them, to
have such street, alley, avenue, public highway or part thereof
paved, repaved, blocked, reblocked, graveled, regraveled, macadamized or remacadamized with a different kind of material
or in a different manner from that specified in such resolution,

then the ordinance providing for the doing of such work or
making such improvement shall provide that the work shall be
done in the manner and with the material specified in such
petition, and in such case the ordinance need not be recoinmended by the board of public works as aforesaid. If the remonstrance of the resident property owners above mentioned
shall be filed with the city clerk, as herein provided, then the
power of the common council to make the proposed improvement and pay therefor in special tax bills shall cease until a
sufficient number of persons so remonstrating or their grantees
shall, in writing, withdraw their names, or the property represented by them, from such remonstrance, so that said remonstrance shall cease to represent a majority of the resident property owners, as above provided, when the common council shall
proceed in the manner above mentioned to cause the proposed
improvement to be made." But by a subsequent section it was
provided: "When it shall be proposed to pave, repave, block, reblock, gravel, regravel, macadamize or remacadamize any street,
alley, avenue, public highway or part thereof and pay therefor
in special tax bills, if the common council shall, by ordinance,
find and declare that the resolution provided in section two of
this article has been published as therein required and that the
resident owners of the city who own a majority in front feet
of all the lands belonging to such residents fronting on the street,
alley, avenue, public highway or part thereof to be improved
have not filed with the city clerk a remonstrance against the
doing of such work or a petition for the making of such improvement with a different kind of material or in a different
manner from that specified in such resolution, or that such petition was filed for the doing of the work as mentioned in said
ordinance, such finding and declaration shall be conclusive for
all purposes, and no special tax bill shall be held invalid or affected for the reason that such resolution was not published as
therein required,or that a remonstrance or _petition sufficiently
signed was filed as therein required, or that suc petition was
not filed or was insufficiently signed." § 4.

By section three it was provided that "all ordinances and
contracts for all work authorized to be done by section two of

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
JUSTICES HIARLAN, W

ITE and MCKENNA, dissenting.

this article shall specify how the same is to be paid for, and in
case payment is to be made in special tax bills, the city shall in
no event nor in any manner whatever be liable for or on account
of the work."
The cost of work done on sidewalks, streets, avenues, alleys
and public highways is provided for in the fifth and sixth sections of the same article, as follows: "The cost of all work on
any sidewalk, including curbing and guttering along the side
thereof, exclusive of the grading of the same, shall be charged
as a special tax upon the adjoining lands according to the frontage thereof on the sidewalk. The cost of all other work specifled in the first three sections of this article on all streets, avenues, alleys and public highways, or parts thereof, shall be
charged as a syecial tax on the land on both sides of and adjoining the street, avenue, alley or public highway, or parts thereof
improved, according to the frontage thereof. . . . When
any work other than grading or regrading, as last aforesaid,
shall be completed, and is to be paid for in special tax bills,
the board of public works shall cause the city engineer to compute the cost thereof, and apportion the same among the several
lots or parcels of land to be charged therewith, and charge each
lot or parcel of land with its proper share of such cost according to the frontage of such land. The board of public works
shall, after the cost of any work has been so apportioned for
payment in special tax bills, except as hereinafter provided,
make out and certify, in favor of the contractor or contractors
to be paid, a special tax bill for the amount of the special tax,
according to such apportionment, against each lot or parcel of
land to be charged."
By section eighteen of the same article every special tax bill
issued under its provisions is made "a lien upon the land described therein, upon the date of the receipt to the board of
public works therefor, and such lien shall continue for two
years thereafter."
It thus appears that under the charter of Kansas City the
cost of the paving or the repaving of any street, avenue, alley
or public highway, is put upon the abutting property under a
riule absolutely excluding any consideration whatever of the

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.

dissenting.

question of special benefits accruing, by reason of the work
done, to such property. It is true the abutting bwner, in defence of a suit brought on a special tax bill, may show any mistake or error in the amount of such bill, or that the work was
not done in a workmanlike manner; but the cost, set forth in
the tax bill, or when ascertained in a suit on the tax bill, must
be borne by the abutting property, according to its frontage,
even if such cost be in substantial excess of the special benefits,
if any, accruing to the property assessed. So the abutting property must bear the cost, according to frontage, even if such cost
eguals the full or actual market value of the land. Thus, the
entire property abutting on the street improved, and subjected
by the statute, that is, by the city charter, to a lien in favor of
the contractor or his assignee, may be taken from the owner,
for the benefit of the general public, to meet the cost of improving a public highway in which the entire community is interested. But that circumstance, it is contended, is not of the
slightest consequence; for-so the argument in support of the
statute runs-the legislature having determined that the land
abutting on a public street shall, according to its frontage, meet
the cost, whatever it may be, of improving that street, the courts
cannot inquire whether the owner has received any such special
benefit as justifies the putting upon him of a special burden not
shared by the general public for whose use the improvement
was made, nor inquire whether the cost of the work equals or
exceeds the value of the property. I cannot assent to this principle. It recognizes, contrary to the principles announced in
Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, 277, 279, 293, 297, the exist-

ence in the legislative branch of government of powers which,
I take leave to say, cannot be exercised without violating the
Constitution of the United States. In that case, upon the fullest consideration, it was held, as had been held in previous cases,
that the due process of law prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment requires compensation to be made or secured to the owner
when private property is taken by a State or under its authority for public use. We also held that an assessment upon abutting property for the cost and expense incurred in opening a
street was to be referred to the power of taxation, and that the

Constitution of the United States forbade an exercise of that
power that would put upon private property the cost of a public work in substantial excess of the special benefits accruing
to it from such work. Let us see if that was not the decision
of the court.
In that case the attempt was made to put upon the abutting
property the entire cost incurred in opening a public street
through the owner's lands. No inquiry as to special benefits
was made; indeed, no inquiry of that character was permissible
under the ordinance in virtue of which the street was opened.
It was not denied that the ordinance was consistent with the
statutes of the State; and the question was distinctly presented
whether a special assessment for the cost of opening a street
through private property could be sustained under the Constitution of the United States if it was made under a Pule excluding all inquiry as to special benefits accruing to the abutting
property by reason of such improvement. In that case it was
the public and not the owner of the property that wished the
street to be opened. The judgment of the Circuit Court enjoining the assessment was affirmed upon the ground-so our mandate expressly stated-that the assessment was "under a rule
which excluded any inquiry as to special benefits, and the necessary operation of which was, to the extent of the excess of the
cost of opening the street in question over any special 6emfts accruing to the abuttingproperty therefrom, to take private property for public use without compensation." The mandate was
in harmony with the opinion, for the court said: "It should be
observed that the decree did not relieve the abutting property
from liability for such amount as could be properly assessed
against it. Its legal effect, as we now adjudge, was only to prevent the enforcement of the particular assessment in question.
It left the village, in its discretion, to take such steps as were
within its power to take, either under existing statutes, or under
any authority that might thereafter be conferred upon it, to
make a new assessment upon the plaintiff's abutting property
for so much of the expense of opening the street as was found
upon due and proper inquiry to be equal to the special benefits
accruing to the property."

dissenting.

As the court in the present case makes some observations as
to the scope of the decision in fforwood v. Baker, it will be well
to ascertain the precise grounds upon which our judgment in that
case was based. Those grounds are indicated by the following
extracts from the opinion:
"Undoubtedly abutting owners may be subjected to special
assessments to meet the exepenses of opening public highways in
font of their property-such assessments, according to well-

established principles, resting upon the ground that special burdens may be imposed for special orpeculiar benefits accruing
from public improvements. ilfobile County v. Kimball, 102 U. S.
691, 703, 704; Illinois Central Railroad v. Decatur, 147 U. S.

190, 202; Bauman v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, 589, and authorities
there cited. And according to the weight of judicial authority,
the legislature has a large discretion in defining the territory to
be deemed specially benefited by a public improvement, and
which may be subjected to special assessment to meet the cost
of such improvement. In Williams v. .Eggleston,170 U. S. 304,
311, where the only question, as this court stated, was as to the
power of the legislature to cast the burden of a public improvement upon certain towns which had been judicially determined
to be towns benefited by such improvement, it was said : 'Neither

can it be doubted that, if the state constitution does not prohibit, the legislature, speaking generally, may create a new taxing district, determine what territory shall belong to such district and what property shall be considered as benefited by a
proposed improvement.' But the power of the legislature in
these matters is not unlimited. There is a point beyond which
the legislative department, even when exerting the power of
taxation, may not go consistently with the citizen's right of
property. As already indicated, the principle underlying special assessments to meet the cost of public improvements is that
the property upon which they are imposed is peculiarly benefited, and therefore the owners do not, in fact, pay anything in
excess of what they receive by reason of such improvement.
But the guaran ties for the protection of private property would
be seriously impaired, if it were established as a rule of constitutional law, that the imposition by the legislature upon partic-

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE and McKNxxA, dissenting.

ular private property of the entire cost of a public improvement,
irrespective of any peculiar benefits accruing to the owner from
such improvement, could not be questioned by him in the courts

of the country."
Again: "It is one thing for the legislature to prescribe as a
general rule that property abutting on a street opened by the
public shall be deemed to have been specially benefited by such
improvement, and therefore should specially contribute to the
cost incurred by the public. It is quite a different thing to lay
it down as an absolute rule that such property, whether it is in
fact benefited or not by the opening of the street, may be assessed by the front foot for a fixed sum representing the whole
cost of the improvement, and without any right in the property
owner to show, when an assessment of that kind is made or is
about to be made, that the sum so fixed is in excess of the benefits received. In our judgment, the exaction from the owner of
private property of the cost of a public improvement in substantial excess of the special benefits accruing to him is, to the
extent of such excess, a taking, under the guise of taxation, of
private property for public use without compensation. We say
' substantial excess,' because exact equality of taxation is not
always attainable, and for that reason the excess of cost over
special benefits, unless it be of material character, ought not to
be regarded by a court of equity when its aid is invoked to
restrain the enforcement of a special assessment." Further, in
the same case: "The decree does not prevent the village, if it
has or obtains power to that end, from proceeding to make an
assessment in conformity with the view indicated in this opinion, namely: That while abutting property may be specially
assessed on account of the expense attending the opening of a
public street in front of it, such assessment must be measured
or limited by the special benefits accruing to it, that is, by benefits that are not shared by the general public; and that taxation of the abutting property for any substantial excess of such
cost over special benefits will, to the extent of such excess, be a
taking of private property for public use without compensation."
Does the court intend in this case to overrule the principles

announced in Norwood v. Baker? Does it intend to reject as
unsound the doctrine that "the principle underlying special
assessments to meet the cost of public improvements is that the
property upon which they are imposed is peculiarly benefited,
and therefore the owners do not, in fact, pay anything in excess
of what they receive by reason of such improvement?" Is it
the purpose of the court, in this case, to overrule the doctrine
that taxation of abutting property to meet the cost of a public
improvement-such taxation being for an amount in substantial
excess of the special benefits received-" will, to the extent of such
excess, be a taking of private property for public use without
compensation?" The opinion of the majority is so worded
that I am not able to answer these questions with absolute confidence. It is difficult to tell just how far the court intends to
go. But I am quite sure, from the intimations contained in
the opinion, that it will be cited by some as resting upon the
broad ground that a legislative determination as to the extent
to which land abutting on a public street may be specially assessed for the cost of paving such street is conclusive upon the
owner, and that he will not be heard, in a judicial tribunal or
elsewhere, to complain even if, under the rule" prescribed, the
cost is in substantial excess of any special benefits accruing to
his property, or even if such cost equals or exceeds the value of
the property specially taxed. The reasons which, in my judgment, condemn such a doctrine as inconsistent with the Constitution are set forth in NYorwood v. Baker, and need not be
repeated. But I may add a reference to some recent adjudications.
In Sears v. Boston, 173 Mass. 71, 78, which was the case of a
special assessment to meet the cost of watering streets, the
court said: "It is now established by the highest judicial anthority that such assessments cannot be so laid upon any estate
as to be in substantial excess of the benefit received. The case
of -Norwoodv. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, contains an elaborate discussion of the subject, with a citation of authorities from many
of the States, and holds that a local assessment for an amount
in substantial excess of the benefit received is in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United

States, inasmuch as it would deprive one of his property without
compensation, and so without clue process of law. The authority of this case is controlling in all state courts, and if it were not,
it is in accordancewith sound )rinciple,and with the great weight
of authority in other courts. The principles which have often
been stated by this court lead to the same result. Boston v.
Boston & Albany Railroad,170 Mass. 95, 101, and cases cited."
In Sears v. Street Commissioners, 173 Mass. 350, 352, which
was the case of charges upon land to meet the cost of certain
sewerage work done under municipal authority, Mr. Justice
Knowlton, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court,
said: "If we treat the determination of these charges as a local
and special assessment upon particular estates, we have to consider the principles on which such taxation is founded. It is
well established that taxation of this kind is permissible under
the constitution of this Commonwealth and under the Constitution of the United States only when founded upon special and
peculiar benefits to the property from the expenditure on account of which the tax is laid, and then only to an amount not
exceeding such special and peculiar benef ts. . . . The fact
that the charges*to be determined are for the construction, maintenance and operation of the sewerage works of the whole city,
gives some force to the possibility of a construction which includes all benefits; but whether this construction should be
adopted or not, the charges maybe determined on any grounds
which the street commissioners deem just and proper, and may
not be founded in any great degree, if at all, upon special and
peculiar benefits, and may in any particular case largely exceed
the benefits. This fact in itself is enough to bring the statute
within the prohibition of the Constitution, inasmuch as it purports to authorize a taking of property to pay a charge which
is not founded on a special benefit or equivalent received by
the estate or its owner. Such a taking would be without due
process of law "-citing .Aorwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269;

Supreme Court of the United States, and in many other courts,
that after the construction of a public improvement a local assessment for the cost of it cannot be laid upon real estate in
substantial excess of the benefit received by the property.
Such assessments must be founded on the benefits, and be proportioned to the benefits."
To the same effect are H1,utchison v. Storrie, 92 Texas, 688; Adams v. City, (Ind.) 57 N. E.

Rep. 166; Cowley v. Spvokane, 99 Fed. Rep. 840.
The court, after referring to the declaration of the Supreme
Court of Missouri to the effect that the Fourteenth Amendment
was not applicable to this case, proceeds, in order to "prevent
confusion and relieve from repetition," to refer to some of the
cases arising under that and the Fifth Amendment. In the
same connection the court, referring to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, says that "while the language of those
Amendments is the same [in respect of the deprivation of property without due process of law], yet as they were engrafted
upon the Constitution at different times and in widely different
circumstances of our national life, it may be that questions may
arise in which different constructions and applications of their
provisions may be proper." As the court expressly declines to
formulate any rule to determine for all cases "what it is for a
State to deprive a person of life, liberty or property without
due process of law," I will not enter upon a discussion of that
question, but content myself with saying that the prohibition
against the deprivation of property without due process of law
cannot mean one thing under the Fifth Amendment and another thing under the Fourteenth Amendment, the words used
being the same in each Amendment. If the court intends to
intimate the contrary in its opinion, I submit that the intimation is not sustained by any former decision, and is not justified
by sound principle.
The first case to which the court refers as arising under the
Fourteenth Amendment is Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S.
97, 103-105. From that case sentences are quoted which were

intended to remove the impression, then supposed to exist with
some, that under that Amendment it was possible to bring "to
the test of the decision of this court the abstract opinions of
every unsuccessful litigant in a state court of the justice of the
decision against him, and of the merits of the legislation on
which such a decision may be founded." But the court in the
present case overlooks another part of the opinion in Davidson
v. New Orleans which was pertinent to the -issue in that case,
and is pertinent to the present discussion. After speaking of
the difficulty of an attempt to lay down any rule to determine
the full scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, and suggesting
that the wise course was to proceed by the gradual process of
judicial inclusion and exclusion, the court said: "As contributing, to some extent, to this mode of determining what class of
cases do not fall within its provision, we lay down the following proposition, as applicable to the case before us: That
whenever by the laws of a State, or by state authority, a tax,
assessment, servitude or other burden is imposed upon property
for the public use, whether it be for the whole State or of some
more limited portion of the community, and those laws provide
for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge thus imposed,
in the ordinary courts of justice, with such notice to the person,
or such proceeding in regard to the property as is appropriate
to the nature of the case, the judgment in such proceedings
cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without
due process of law, however obnoxious it may be t6 other objections."
-lere is a direct affirmation of the doctrine that a
tax, assessment, servitude or other burden may be imposed by
a State, or under its authority, consistently with the due process of law prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment, f the
person owning the property upon which such tax, assessment,
servitude or burden is imposed is given an opportunity, in some
appropriate way, to contest the matter. In the present case,
no such opportunity was given to the plaintiffs in error, and
the state court held that they had no right to show, in any
tribunal, that their property was being taken for the cost of
improving a public street in substantial excess of any special

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE

benefits accruing to them beyond those accruing to the general
public owning and using the street so improved.
Reference is made by the court to fcAfillen v. Anderson,
95 U. S. 38, 41, 42, in which will be found certain observations
as to the words "due process of law." In that case the only
question was whether a statute of Louisiana imposing a license
tax, which did not give a person an opportunity to be present
when the tax was assessed against him, or provide for its collection by suit, was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The court, after referring to the provision requiring, in case
the license tax was not paid, that the collector should give ten
days' written or printed notice to the delinquent, and if at the
expiration of that time the license was not fully paid, the tax
collector might, without judicial formality, proceed to seize and
sell, after ten days' advertisement, the property of the delinquent, or so much as might be necessary to pay the taxes and
costs, said: "Another statute declares who is liable to this tax,
and fixes the amount of it. The statute here complained of relates only to the manner of its collection. Here is a notice that
the party is assessed, by the proper officer, for a given sum, as
a tax of a certain kind, and ten days' time given him to pay it.
Is not this a legal mode of proceeding? It seems to be supposed that it is essential to the validity of this tax that the
party charged should have been present, or had an opportunity
to be present, in some tribunal when he was assessed. But this
is not, and never has been, considered necessary to the validity
of a tax. And the fact that most of the States now have boards
of revisers of tax assessments does not prove that taxes levied
without them are void. Nor is the person charged with such
a tax without legal remedy by the laws of Louisiana. It is
probable that in that State, as in others, if compelled to pay
the tax by a levy upon his property, he can sue the proper
party and recover back the money as paid under duress, if the
tax was illegal. But however that may be, it is quite certain
that he can, if he is wrongfully taxed, stay the proceedingsforits
collection by process of injunction. See Fouqua's Code of Prac-

tice of Louisiana, Arts. 296-309, inclusive.

ings when issued to stay the collection of taxes. It declares that
they shall be treated by the courts as preferred cases, and imposes a double tax upon a dissolution of the injunction." Here
we have, contrary to the intimation given in the opinion of the
court in this case, a recognition of the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment does apply to cases of taxation under the
laws of a State. And it is to be observed that the court in
. cifillen v. Anderson, takes care to show that, under the laws
of Louisiana, the taxpayer was given an opportunity to be heard
in respect of the validity of the tax imposed upon him.
Amongthe cases cited in support of the conclusions announced
by the majority are f.iattingly v. District of Columbia, 97 U. S.
687, 692; Kelly v. Pittsburgh, 104 U. S. 78; Spencer v..,.,chant, 125 U. S. 345; Paulsen v. Portland,149 U. S.30, 40;
Bauman v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, and Parsons v. District (f
Columbia, 170 U. S. 45.
It seems to me quite clear that the particular question before
us was not involved or determined in any of those cases.
In X3attingly v. District qf Columbia, it was said that the
legislature may direct special assessments for special road or
street improvements "to be made in proportion to the frontage,
area or market value of the adjoining property, at its discretion." But that falls far short of deciding that an assessment
in proportion to frontage could be sustained if it exceeded the
value of the property or was for an amount in excess of the
special benefits accruing to the property assessed. Besides, no
question was made in that case as to the cost of the work exceeding special benefits.
In .Kelly v. PIM4)urgh,the only point involved or adjudged
was that the Fourteenth Amendment did not stand in the way
of the legislature of a State extending the limits of a city or
township so as to include lands fit for agricultural use only,
and make them subject to taxation for the local purposes of the
extended city or town, although the owners did not enjoy the
advantages of the municipal government to the same extent as
those who resided in the thickly settled parts of the city or
town. It was not a case in which the property of particular
persons was specially assessed by a rule not applicable to all

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE

and MCKENNA, dissenting.

other assessments. On the contrary it was admitted in that
case that the methods adopted to ascertain the value for purposes of local taxation of the lands there in question were such
as were usually employed, and that the manner of apportioning
and collecting the tax was not unusual or materially different
from that in force in all communities where land was subject
to taxation. It was held that it was not the function of the
court to correct mere errors inthe valuation of lands for purposes of taxation.
In Spencer v. .Ierchant no question arose as to an excess of
the cost of the improvement there in question over special benefits. The question before the court was as to the constitutionality of a statute validating what had been judicially determined to be a void assessment. This court so declared when it
said that the plaintiff, who questioned the validity of the statute, contended "that the statute of 1881 was unconstitutional
and void, because it was an attempt by the legislature to validate a void assessment, without giving the owners of the lands
assessed an opportunity to be heard upon the whole amount of
the assessment." The court held that the statute itself was,
under the circumstances of that case, all the notice and hearing
the owners of the lands required. There was no occasion for
any general declaration as to the powers of the legislature which
would cover cases of void assessments validated by legislative
enactment where the amount assessed upon particular property
was in substantial excess of special benefits accruing to it. Referring to Spencer v. .1erchant, this court said in Nvorwood v.
Baker: "The point raised in that case-the onlypointinjudg-

ment-was one relating to proper notice to the owners of the
property assessed, in order that they might be heard upon the
question of the equitable apportionment of the sum directed to
be levied upon all of them. This appears from both the opinion
and the dissenting opinion in that case."
In Paulsen v. Portland the only point adjudged was that
notice by publication in a newspaper of the time and place of
the meeting of viewers appointed to estimate the proportionate share which each piece should bear of the amount to be
assessed upon the property in a sewer district for the cost of a

OCTOBER TERMI, 1900.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WirE and MCKENNA, dissenting.

sewer, was sufficient "to bring the proceedings within due
process of law." The court in that case took care to say that
it did not question the proposition that "notice to the taxpayer in some form must be given before an assessment for
the construction of a sewer can be sustained, as in any other
demand upon the individual for a portion of his property."
That case cannot be held to support the views of the Supreme
Court of Missouri, for that. court in this case held in substance
that, under legislative authority, property fronting on a public
street could all be taken to pay the cost of improving the street,
leaving nothing whatever to the owner, and that too without
any notice and without any right in the owner, in any form,
to show that the amount required to be paid exceeded not
only any special benefits accruing to the property but even
the value of the property assessed.
In Bauman v. Ross we had a case in which a special assessment was made, under an act of Congress, imposing upon the
lands benefited one half of the amount awarded by the court
as damages for each highway or reservation, or part thereof,
condemned and established under the act. The assessment was
directed to be "charged upon the lands benefitdd by the laying
out and opening of such highway or reservatien or part thereof,"
and the jury was directed "to ascertain and determine what
property is thereby benefited." The same act directed the jury
to assess against each parcel which it found to be so benefited
its proportional part of the sum assessed, provided that as to
any fract, part of which only had been taken, due allowance
should be made for the amount, if any, "which shall have
been deducted from the value of the part taken on account of
the benefit to the remainder of the tract." In such a case, the
owner of the property being given full right to be heard before
an authorized tribunal upon the question of special benefits, no
question could arise such as is presented in the present one.
In Parsonsv. District of Columbia the question was as to
the validity of an act of Congress which provided for establishing, in this District, "a comprehensive system, regulafing
the supply of water and the erection and maintenance of reservoirs and water mains." It was provided that assessments

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE

and

McKENNA,

361

dissenting.

levied for water mains should be at the rate of $1.25 per linear
foot against all lots or land abutting upon the street, road or
alley in which a water main is laid. This court, among other
things, said: "Another complaint urged is that the assessment
exceeded the actual cost of the work, and this is supposed to be
shown by the fact that the expense of putting down this particular main was less than the amount raised by the assessment. But this objection overlooks the fact that the laying of
this main was part of the water system, and that the assessment
prescribed was not merely to put down the pipes, but to raise
a fund to keep the system in efficient repair. The moneys raised
beyond the expense of laying the pipes are not paid into the general treasury of the District, but are set aside to maintain and
repairtiLe system." But the court took care to add, "and there
is no such disproportion between the amount assessed and the
actual cost as to show any abuse of legislative power." The
words thus added are significant, and if they had not been
added the opinion would not have passed without dissent.
The words referred to justify the conclusion that if there had
been an abuse of legislative power; if the amount assessed
had been substantially or materially in excess of the cost of
the work or of the value of the property assessed, or of the
special benefits received, the owners of the abutting property
might justly have complained of a violation of their constitutional rights.
The court, in its opinion, quotes certain passages from Cooley's
Treatise qn Taxation, in which the author refers to the different
modes in vhich the cost of local public work may be met, namely:
(1) a general tax to cover the major part of the cost, the smaller
portion t; be levied upon the estates specially benefited; (2) a
tax on the land specially benefited to meet the major part of
the cost, the smaller part to be paid by the general public; and
(3) a tax for the whole cost on the lands in the immediate vicinity of the work. In respect of each of these methods the
court cites these words of Cooley: "In a constitutional point
of view, either of these methods is admissible, and one may
sometimes be just and another at other times. In other cases
it may be deemed reasonable to make the whole cost a general

charge, and levy no special assessment whatever. The question
is legislative, and like all legislative questions, may be decided
erroneously; but it is reasonable to expect that, with such latitude of choice, the tax will be more just and equal, than it would
be were the legislature required to levy it by one inflexible and
arbitrary rule." Cooley on Taxation, 447, c. 20, § 5 ; Cooley on
Taxation, 2d ed. 637, § 5.
But in the same chapter from which the above extract was
made the author discusses fully the underlying principles of special assessments, saying: " Special assessments are a peculiar
species of taxation, standing apart from the general burdens imposed for state and municipal purposes, and governed by principles that do not apply generally. The general levy of taxes
is understood to exact contributions in return for the general
benefits of government, and it promises nothing to the persons
taxed beyond what may be anticipated from an administration
of the laws for individual protection and the general public good.
Special assessments, on the other hand, are made upon the assumption that a portion of the community is to be specially and
peculiarly benefited in the enhancement of the value of property
peculiarly situated as regardsa contemplated expenditure of public funds; and, in addition to the general levy, they demand
that special contributions, in considerationof the special benefit,
shall be made by the person receiving it. The justice of demanding the special contribution is supposed to be evident in
the fact that the persons who are to make it, while they are
made to bear the cost of a public work, are at the same time to
suffer no pecuniary loss thereby, their property being increased
in value by the expenditure to an amount at least equal to the
sum they are required to pay. This is the idea that underlies
all these levies." Cooley on Taxation, 416, c. 20, § 1; Cooley on
Taxation, 2d ed. 606, § 1. To this we may add the declaration
of the author when, speaking for the Supreme Court of M ichigan
in Thomas v. Gain, 35 Alich. 155, 162, he said: "It is generally
agreed that an assessment levied without regardto actual orpTrobable benefits is unlawful as constitutingan attempt to appropriate
private property top ublic use."
The court overruled other passages in the same chapter of

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE and MCKENNA,

363

dissenting.

Cooley's Treatise on Taxation. Referring to the rule of assessment by the front foot upon property abutting on a local improvement, where no taxing district has been established over which
the cost could be distributed by some standard of benefit, actual
or presumptive, Cooley says: "But it has been denied, on what
seems the most conclusive grounds, that this is permissible. It is
not legitimate taxation because it is lacking in one of its indispensable elements. It considers each lot by itself, compelling each
to bear the burden of the improvement in front of it, without reference to any contribution to be made to the improvement by
any other property, and it is consequently without any apportionment. From accidental circumstances, the major part of
the cost of an important public work may be expended in front
of a single lot; those circumstances not at all contributing to
make the improvement more valuable to the lot thus specially
burdened, perhaps even having the opposite consequence. But
whatever might be the result in particular cases, the fatal vice
in the system is that it provides no axing districts whatever.
It is as arbitrary in principle, and would sometimes be as unequal in operation, as a regulation that a town from which a
state officer chanced to be chosen should pay his salary, or that
that locality in which the standing army, or any portion of it,
should be stationed for the time being should be charged with
its support. If one is legitimate taxation the other would be.
In sidewalk cases a regulation of the kind has been held admissible, but it has been justified as a regulation of police, and is
not supported on the taxing power exclusively. As has been
well said, to compel individuals to contribute money or property to the use of the public, without reference to any common
ratio, and without requiring the sum paid by one piece or kind
of property, or by one person, to bear any relation whatever
to that paid by another, is to lay a forced contribution, not a
tax, within the sense of those terms as applied to the exercise of
powers by any enlightened or responsible government." Cooley
on Taxation, 453 c. 20, § 53; Cooley on Taxation, 2d ed. 646, 647.
The author also says what I do not find in the opinion of the
court in this case: "There can be no justification for any proceeding which charges the land with an assessment greater than

toyublicuse withoutconmpensation." Cooley on Taxation, 2d ed.

661.
The court also cites from Dillon's Treatise on M unicipal Corporations certain passages to the effect that whether the expense of making local improvements "shall be paid out of the
general treasury, or be assessed upon the abutting or other property specially benefited, and if in the latter mode, whether the
assessment shall be upon all property found to be benefited, or
alone upon the abuttees, according to frontage or according to
the area of their lots, is according to the present weight of authority considered to be a question of legislative expediency."
2 Dillon, Mun. Corp. 4th ed. p. 912, § 752. These views need
not be controverted in this case, and of their soundness I have
no doubt when we are ascertaining the general rule to be applied in the particular classes of cases referred to by the author.
But the above quotation from Dillon by no means indicates his
opinion as to the application of the general rule announced by
him. In the same chapter from which the court quotes, I find
the following principles announced by the author as deduced
from an extended reference to numerous adjudged cases: "Special benefits to the property assessed, that is, benefits received
by it in addition to those received by the community at large, is
the true and only just foundation npon which local assessments
can ivest; and to the extent of sp)ecial benefits it is everywhere

admitted that the legislature may authorize local taxes or assessments to be made."

Again: "When not restrained by the

constitution of the particular State, the legislature has a discretion, commensurate with the broad domain of legislative
power, in making provisions for ascertaining what property is
specially benefited and how the benefits shall be apportioned.
This proposition, as stated, is nowhere denied ; but the adjudged
cases do not agree upon the extent of legislative power. The
courts which have followed the doctrine of the leading case in
New York, People v. Brooklyn, 4 N. Y. 419, have asserted that
the authority of the legislature in this regard is quite without
limits; but the decided tendency of the later decisions, including
those of the courts of New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania,

FRENCH v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING CO.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE and MCKENNA, dissenting.

is to hold that the legislative power is not unlimited, and that
these assessments must be apportioned by some rule capable of
producing reasonable equality, and that provisions of such a
nature as to make it legally impossible that the burden can be
apportioned with proximate equality are arbitrary exactions
and not an exercise of legislative authority." 2 Dillon, Mun.
Corp. 4th ed. p. 934, §761. Further, the author says: "Whether
it is competent for the legislature to declare that no part of the
expense of a local improvement of a public nature shall be
borne by a general tax, and that the whole of it shall be assessed upon the abutting property and other property in the
vicinity of the improvements, thus for itself conclusively determining, not only that such property is specially benefited, but
that it is thus benefited to the extent of the cost of the improvement, and then to provide for the apportionment of the amount
by an estimate to be made by designated boards or officers, or
by frontage or superficial area., is a question upon which the
courts are not agreed. Almost all of the earlier cases asserted
that the legislative discretion in the- apportionment of public
burdens extended this far, and such legislation is still upheld in
most of the States. But since the period when express provisions have been made in many of the state constitutions requiring uniformity and equality of taxation, several courts of great
respectability, eithef by force of this requirement or in the spirit
of it, and perceiving that special benefits actually received by

each parcel of contributing property, was the onlyprincitleupon
which such assessments can justly rest, and that any other rule
is ynequal, oppressive and arbitrary,have denied the unlimited

scope of legislative discretion and power, and asserted what
must upon principle be regardedas the just and reasonable doc-

trine, that the cost of a local improvement can be assessed upon
particular property only to the extent that it is specially and peculiarly benefited; and since the excess beyond that is a benefit
to the municipality at large, it must be borne by the general

treasury." 2 Dillon, Mun. Corp. 4th ed. p. 935, § 761.
I agree with the court in saying that Cooley and Dillon are
text-writers of high authority for learning and accuracy. But
I cannot agree that the extracts from their treatises found in

OCTOBER" TERM, 1900.
JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE and MCKENNA, dissenting.

its opinion correctly or fully state their views upon the particular question now before us.
The declaration by the court that the decision in Norwood
v. Baker was placed upon the ground that the burdens imposed
upon Mrs. Baker's property amounted to confiscation is, I submit, an inadequate view of our decision. The word "confiscation" is not to be found in the opinion in that case. The
affirmance of the judgment in that case was upon the sole
ground that the assessment was made under a 'ule that absolutely excladed any inquiry as to special benefits. Such a rule
was held to be void because it rested upon the theory that to
meet the cost of opening a street private property could be specially assessed for an amount in substantial excess of special
benefits accruing to it from the improvement made in the interest of the general public.
If it may be inferred from what is said in the opinion of the
court in this case that a special assessment resulting in the confiscation,of the entire property assessed might not be sustained,
I have to say that manifestly confiscation does occur when the
property specially assessed is all taken to meet the cost of a
public improvement supposed to be specially beneficial to the
owner. So if the property is assessed beyond the special benefits accruing, there is confiscation to the extent of such excess.
But if confiscation, in any form, will not be tolerated, what becomes of the broad declarations in the opinions in some of the
cited cases to the effect that the legislature may prescribe
the extent to which private property is specifically benefited
by a local public improvement, and that its action in that respect cannot be questioned by the owner of the property assessed
even if it appeared that the amount assessed exceeded the special benefits, or even if it appeared that the cost of the improvement exceeded the value of the property assessed ? Are we to
understand from the interpretation now placed upon the decision in Jforwood v. Baker that the courts may, for the protection of the property owner, interfere when a legislative
determination amounts to confiscation, pure and simple, but
that they cannot interfere when the amount assessed is in substantial excess of the benefits received?

JUSTICES HARLAN, WHITE and MCKENNA, dissenting.

In my judgment, some of the cases referred to in the opinion

of the court contain general declarations as to the powers of
the legislature in the matter of special assessments which went
far beyond what was necessary to be said in order to dispose
of the respective cases. Those declarations, literally interpreted, seem to recognize the legislature in this country as
possessing absolute, arbitrary power in the matter of special
assessments imposed to meet the cost of a public improvement
-indeed, all the power, in the matter of taxation, that belongs
to the Parliament of Great Britain. The opinions in some of
these cases recall the wise observations of Chief Justice Marshall, when, speaking for this court, he said: "It is a maxim
not to be disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion,
are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be
respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision. The
reason for the maxim is obvious. The question actually before
the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full
extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it are
considered in their relation to the case to be decided, but their
possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated." Coh ens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399. We live
under a Constitution which is the supreme law of the land. It
enumerates the powers of government, and prescribes limitations and restrictions upon legislative authority as to the property of citizens. Some of these limitations and restrictions
apply equally to the Congress of the United States and to the
legislatures of the States. If it be true that the only ground
upon which a special assessment can be legally imposed upon
particular private property to meet the cost of a public improvement is that such property receives, or may reasonably be held
to receive, special benefits not shared by the general publicand no one, I take it, will dispute the soundness of that principle-and if it be true that the property cannot be made to bear
a proportion of such costs in substantial excess of special benefits, it necessarily follows that the owner of the property is entitled to protection against any legislative rule or requirement.

that puts upon his property a burden greater than can be lawfully imposed upon it. How can he obtain such protection
except through the courts? To say that he cannot do so is to
say that the legislature possesses an absolute unlimited power
over rights of property which is inconsistent with the supreme
law of the land. Is it to become a canon of constitutional construction that the courts may interfere when the legislature
authorizes a special assessment that will amount to the confiscation of the entire property assessed, but will not interfere
when the confiscation is only to a limited, although a material,
extent? In other words, is there to be a difference, so far as
the powers of the courts are concerned, between confiscation,
under the guise of taxation, of the entire property of the citizen and confiscation of only a part of it?
I have spoken of special assessments where the amount assessed was in substantial excess of special benefits. The words
"substantial excess" have been used because, in the language
of this court in _N-orwood v. Baker, already cited, exact equality
of taxation is not always attainable, and for that reason the
excess of cost over special benefits, unless it be of a substantial
character, ought not to be regarded by a court of equity when
its aid is invoked to restrain the enforcement of a special assessment. I do not doubt-indeed, the opinion in .Yorwood v.
Baker concedes-that the legislature has a wide discretion in
cases of special assessments to meet the cost of improving or
opening public highways. But I deny that the owner of abutting property can be precluded from showing that the amount
assessed upon him is in substantial excess of special benefits accruing to his property. To the extent of such excess the burden
should be borne by the community for whose benefit the improvement is made. I entirely concur in the views of Church, C. J., as
expressed in Guest v. Brooklyn, 69 N. Y. 506. He said: "The
right to make a public street is based upon public necessity, and
the public should pay for it. To force an expensive improvement [against the consent of the owners, or a majority of them]
upon a few property owners against their consent, and compel
them to pay the entire expense, under the delusive pretense of
a corresponding specific benefit conferred upon their property,

is a species of despotism that ought not to be perpetuated under
a government which claims to protect property equally with
life and liberty. Besides its manifest injustice, it deprives the
citizen practically of the principal protection [aside from constitutional restraints] against unjust taxation, viz., the responsibility of the representative for his acts to his constituents.
As respects general taxation where all are equally affected,
this operates, but it has no beneficial application in preventing
local taxation for public improvements. The majority are
never backward in consenting to, or even demanding, improvements which they may enjoy without expense to themselves."
2 Dillon's Mun. Corp. 934, 4th ed. note 1.
At the same time this case was determined the court announced its judgment in Wight v. Davidson, on appeal from
the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. In its opiniou in that case it makes some reference to Norwood v. Baker
to which it is appropriate to refer in this opinion. The court,
in Wight v. Davidson, says: "There [in Norwood v. Baker,]
the question was as to the validity of a village ordinance, which
imposed the entire cost and expenses of opening a street, irrespective of the question whether the property was benefited by
the opening of the street. The legislature of the State had not
defined or designated the abutting property as benefited by the
improvement, nor had the village authorities made any inquiry
into the question of benefits. There having been no legislative
determination as to what lands were benefited, no inquiry instituted by the village councils, and no opportunity afforded to
the abutting owner to be heard on that subject, this court held
that the exaction from the owner of private property of the
cost of a public improvement in substantial excess of the special
benefits accruing to him is, to the extent of such excess, a taking,
under the guise of taxation, of private property for public use
without compensation, and accordingly affirmed the decree of
the Circuit Court of the United States, which, while preventing
the enforcement of the particular assessment in question, left
the village free to make a new assessment upon the plaintiff's
abutting property for so much of the expense of opening the
street as would be found, upon due and proper inquiry, to be

equal to the special benefits accruing to the property." This
language implies that the assessment in Norwood v. Baker, was
without legislative sanction and hence the judgment rendered
by this court; whereas, it distinctly and unmistakably appears
from the opinion in that case that what the village of INorwood
did was under a legislative enactment authorizing it to open
the street there in question and assess the cost upon the abutting property, according to its frontage, without regard to special
benefits, and without any inquiry upon that subject. And it
was because and only because of this rule established by the
legislature that the court held the assessment invalid. I submit that this case cannot be distinguished from Xorwood v.
Baker upon the ground that the village of Norwood proceeded
without legislative sanction.
In my opinion the judgment in the present case should be
reversed upon the ground that the assessment in question was
made under a statutory rude excluding all inquiry as to special
benefits and requiring the property abutting on the avenue in
question to meet the entire cost of paving it, even if such cost
was in substantial excess of the special benefits accruing to it.;
leaving Kansas City to obtain authority to make a new assessment upon the abutting property for so much of the cost of
paving as may be found upon due inquiry to be not in excess
of the special benefits accruing to such property. Any other
judgment will, I think, involve a grave departure from the
principles that protect private property against arbitrary legislative power exerted under the guise of taxation.
