considered.
Looked at from any point of view we do not think the appellants have borne the burden of showing the validity of their

be properly inferred within the cases already decided by this

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
CERTIORARI TO THE coURr OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 207. Argued March 19, 20, 1901. -Decided

April 15, 1901.

The question in this case involves the construction and effect of the decision
of this court in the case of Baker v. Cummings, 169 U. S. 189, between the
same parties, and growing out of the same transaction which is the subject of the litigation in this case.
Matters which have been fully investigated between the parties and determined by the court, shall not be again contested, and the judgment of
the court upon matters thus determined shall be conclusive on the parties, and never subject to further inquiry.
This doctrine applies to this case.

THE petitioner (plaintiff below) commenced this action at law
in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on December 19, 1889, to recover from the defendant the sum of $2712.81
with interest at six per centum from July 31, 1889, and annexed
to his declaration a bill of particulars of his demand. Plaintiff
claimed in his declaration that the money was due, among other
things, on an account stated between the parties. The plaintiff
obtained judgment in the trial court for the amount of his claim,
which was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District.
A case between the same parties and growing out of the same
transaction has already been before this court and decided. 169
U. S. 189. The question in this case involves the construction

Statement of the Case.

and effect of that decision, and therefore a writ of certiorari
was applied for and granted, and the case brought here.
Soon after the commencement of this action and before pleading to the declaration filed therein, Cummings, the defendant,
commenced a suit on the equity side of the Supreme Court of
the District against Baker for the purpose of enjoining him
from the further prosecution of this action, and to obtain a
full and complete accounting under the order and direction of
the court between complainant and Baker in respect to the
partnership dealings alleged and set up in the bill, and he
prayed that the defendant should be decreed to pay to him
the amount which should be found due him and for other relief. In his bill the complainant alleged the formation of a
copartnership on January 1, 1876, between the parties, to prosecute the practice of the law in the city of Washington, terminable by mutual consent, each to share equally in all the profits
and losses of the business, and it was averred that the partnership continued until September 1, 1889, when it was dissolved.
It was then alleged that the terms of the dissolution were agreed
upon through false and fraudulent representations of Baker as
to the condition of the partnership affairs in relation to what
were called "the inspector cases," made to the complainant,
with the facts in regard to which the defendant was, as the
complainant alleged, much more familiar than the complainant, and that, based upon the misrepresentations, terms of
agreement for dissolution were arrived at, and in carrying out
the same the complainant assigned by a written assignment his
claims under the partnership to all moneys then due or that might
thereafter become due arising from those cases, and as consideration therefor the complainant received from the defendant
the sum of $15,000; that instead of the amount stated by the
defendant to be due the partnership in relation to the cases
mentioned, a very much larger amount was due, and instead
of there being only a certain named amount of claims in cases
where no Congressional appropriation had been made, as stated
by the defendant, a very much larger amount existed to his
knowledge, of which the complainant was ignorant, and upon
the faith of these untrue and fraudulent statements the com-

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Statement of the Case.

plainant assigned by a written assignment all his interest in
the cases for a sum largely below the amount actually belonging to him under the terms of the partnership.
The complainant then alleged the commencement of an action at law by Baker against him to recover $2712.81, and
stated that appended to the declaration in that action was a
bill of particulars of Baker's claim, and that all of the items in
that bill of particulars originated in and grew out of the partnership dealings of the parties and not otherwise, and that only
by a full, proper and complete accounting and discovery, under
the order and direction of a court of equity, could a proper adjustment be had of the rights of the complainant and defendant growing out of their partnership dealings.
Complainant further alleged that the action at law was not
yet at issue, but that the time for pleading thereto had nearly
approached, and that the complainant could not, under the
rules at law, incorporate in his plea the equitable defences
herein set forth, and which in a court of equity would avail
against Baker's demand, and especially that the equitable right
of the complainant to have discovery in the premises and to
have the said assignment cancelled and held for naught was
not cognizable by a court of law, and that if the defendant
(Baker) were therefore permitted to prosecute his action at law
against the complainant, the latter would be deprived of his
defences to that suit which were set up in the bill, and the
complainant therefore alleged that he was entitled to have the
defendant enjoined from prosecuting his action at law, and to
have the court order and direct a full and complete accounting
between the complainant and defendant in respect to their
partnership dealings. An order was thereupon issued restrainlug the further prosecution of this action, which order was subsequently and about February 1, 1892, dissolved.
To this bill the defendant Baker filed an answer February 10,
1890, denying all allegations of fraud in the settlement between
the parties or in the procuring of the assignament, and also alleging that he furnished the complainant with all needed data,
and all the data and information which existed in connection
with the facts within his control, and that the settlement was

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Statement of the Case.

made with full knowledge of all the facts on the part of the
complainant, and that after such settlement -was made he left
in the possession of the complainant papers and accounts plainly
showing the whole transaction and all the facts in regard to
the case, an examination of which would give all necessary information about the partnership affairs. He also alleged that
the complainant was endeavoring, after a lapse of more than
three years and with a full knowledge of all the facts, to attack
this settlement as void, and he alleged that the claim made by
the complainant was old and stale, and he pleaded the statute
of limitations in his behalf, and alleged that the claim did not
accrue nor was any demand made to show whether error or
otherwise were made within the period of three years.
After the injunction restraining the further prosecution of
this action had been dissolved, and on February 10, 1892, the
defendant filed a plea to the declaration herein, in which he
denied, (1) that he was indebted to the plaintiff ; (2) he alleged
that he never promised as set up in the declaration; (3) that
the plaintiff's cause of action did not accrue within three years;
(4 and 5) a set-off of $35,873.35. This set-off was alleged to
have arisen out of the dealings between the parties in the partnership already mentioned.
The plaintiff Baker joined issue upon the plea on August 24,
1892. Further proceedings in this action were delayed by mutual consent until the trial of the suit in equity. Upon that
trial the complainant obtained a decree for thirty-odd thousand
dollars, after deducting the amount claimed to be due the plaintiff in this action. That decree was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals of the District, and the case was taken by appeal to
this court, where the decrees of the courts below were reversed
and the case remanded with instructions to the Supreme Court
to dismiss the bill. The dismissal was general, and not "without prejudice" or any similar expression. 169 U. S. 189. After
the entry of the decree dismissing the bill on the mandate of
this court in the equity suit, Baker, the plaintiff herein by leave
of the court filed in this action a replication to the plea of setoff, setting up the commencement of the equity suit, and stating
the issues involved therein and the decree made upon the deci-

Statement of the Case.

sion of this court dismissing the bill, and claimed that judgment
as res adjudicataof the matters of set-off contained in the fourth
and fifth counts of the defendant's plea. Then by a series of
pleadings, too long and too technical for repetition, the final
question was raised by demurrer as to whether the plaintiff's
replication of r'es adjudicatato the defendant's plea of set-off
was good or not. Upon the argument of the demurrer the
Supreme Court held that the replication was good; that the
merits of the whole case had been decided in the equity suit,
and that the judgment in that suit was a bar to all claims of
set-off on the part of the defendant Cummings in the action at
law. The parties came to trial after the argument and decision
upon the demurrer, and having waived a jury the following
stipulation was filed:
"It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties to this cause, by their respective attorneys, that this cause
may be tried by the court without a jury, the parties hereby
expressly waiving the same, upon the following agreed statement of facts, subject to the limitations herein contained:
"That on the 31st day of July, A. D. 1889, and for a long
time prior thereto, the plaintiff and the defendant were copartners engaged as attorneys in the prosecution of claims against
the United States, the net fees derived therefrom being under
the contract of partnership equally to be divided between them,
the said partners; that on the 19th day of December, A. D.
1889, the plaintiff instituted this action to recover the sum of
$2712.81, -vith interest from the 31st day of July, A. D. 1889 ;
that the said sum is the identical sum referred to on pages 227
and 24:8 of the record on appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States in the equity cause hereinafter referred to; that
after the institution of this suit the defendant herein instituted
a certain equity proceeding against the plaintiff herein in the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, the same being
known and numbered on the dockets of said court as equity
cause No. 12,263; the record, decrees and opinions of the respective courts therein, both in this and the appellate courts,
are hereby referred to and made part hereof ; that the several
items of account set forth in -the pleas of set-off herein are re-

spectively the identical items set up, referred to and claimed in
said equity cause.
"If the court on inspection of said record and proceedings
in said equity cause and of the record and proceedings of this
cause shall be of opinion that the defendant herein may not
set up in bar of the plaintiff's action any of said items of set-off
and counter claim as pleaded in this action, but is concluded by
the proceedings and decree in said equity cause, then this court
may enter judgment for the plaintiff in this action for the sum
of $2712.81, with interest thereon from the 31st day of July,
A. ID. 1889, as claimed in his declaration herein, but if the
court shall be of opinion that any of said items of set-off and
counter claim may be set up in bar of the plaintiff's action
herein, then this cause shall be remanded to the docket for
trial by jury. Both parties hereto reserve the right of appeal
or by writ of error from the judgment of this court or of any
court of review passing hereon, and also any other remedy
which they may by law be entitled to."
Upon this stipulation in connection with the record in the
equity suit, the Supreme Court held that the defendant Cummings could not in this action set up in bar to plaintiff's action
any of the items of set-off attached to his plea, and therefore
judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed
by him. On appeal to the Court of Appeals the judgment was
reversed, and a new trial granted, Mr. Chief Justice Alvey dissenting.

-Mr. -'anklin H -Mackey

M'R. JUSTICE PECKMr, after making the above statement of
facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
A perusal of the record in this case demonstrates at least
how conservative Congress has heretofore been in relation to
the adoption of any amendment of the law relating to pleading

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

and procedure in the District of Columbia. The last of the series of pleadings herein by which the question of the validity
of the defence of res adjudicatawas finally brought before the
court is denominated "defendant's joinder of issue on plaintiff's
second sur-rejoinder to defendant's fourth rejoinder to plaintiff's third replication." Replications, rejoinders, sur-rejoinders,
rebutters, sur-rebutters and demurrers abound, and they all
seem to have been regarded as properly filed for the purpose of
presenting the question whether the decree in the equity case
was res adjudicataor not. In reading these pleadings we seem
to be transported back to the days when the practice of the special pleader had become a science by itself. In spite of the
pleadings, however, the question before us is a simple one.
The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant a certain amount of money alleged to be due on an account
stated between the parties. The defendant, before pleading in
the action, commenced a suit in equity for an accounting between himself as complainant and the defendant in the equity
suit in relation to all partnership matters, and, as a part of the
relief, prayed the cancellation of a written assignment made
by complainant of his interest in the inspector cases of the partnership to the defendant, procured, as complainant alleged, by
fraud. It was alleged that the items of the claim of Baker,
the plaintiff in this action, arose out of the partnership transactions, and they were included in the issue made in the equity
suit. There was a full hearing in that suit in regard to all
the matters between the parties, including those arising in this
action. At the end of the hearing the trial court entered a
decree in favor of the complainant for over $30,000, after deducting the amount claimed against him by the plaintiff herein.
That decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, but upon
appeal here both decrees were reversed and the cause remanded
to the lower court with instructions to dismiss the bill. The
court, upon the receipt of the mandate, did dismiss the bill with
costs. The plaintiff in this action then proceeded with his case
and set up, by leave of the court, the decree in the equity suit
as an adjudication of all the matters relating to the validity of
the defendant's set-off to his demand, and the question is, Shall

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

the adjudication be treated as conclusive upon those matters, or
shall the inquiry be again entered upon as to the facts upon
which the set-off rests?
Stated generally and without detall, the theory of the law is
that matters which have once been fully investigated between
the parties and determined by the court shall not be again contested, and that the judgment of the court upon matters thus
determined shall be conclusive on the parties and never subject
to further inquiry. The whole doctrine has been lately gone
over in this court in Southern Pacific Railroad Company v.
United ,States, 168 U. S. 1, and the law in regard to it is so well
settled that other citations are not required. The question is
not what the doctrine is, but does it apply to the particular case?
We have to inquire, therefore, whether the decree in the
equity suit did cover and conclude the matters in difference,
regarding the defendant's set-off in this action? If it did, that
decree must be treated as conclusive, and the judgment of the
court below refusing to give that character to it must be reversed.
It appears by the stipulation between the parties that the
several items of account set forth in the defendant's plea of setoff in this action are respectively the identical items set up, referred to and claimed by complainant in the equity cause. The
record in the equity cause is made a part of the record herein,
and the facts upon which the complainant proceeded are set
forth in the report of that case in this court, already referred
to. The mandate from this court in that case, which by stipulation of counsel has been included in the record herein, sets
forth our decree, which reversed the decree of the Court of Appeals with costs, and ordered that the cause be remanded to
that court with directions to set aside the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and to remand the
cause to that court with instructions to dismiss the bill. There
was added the usual formula directing that such further proceedings be had in the cause in conformity with the opinion
and decree of this court as ought to be had, etc. The proceedings, however, which were thus directed to be taken were simply
to reverse the judgment of the lower court and to dismiss the

bill.

It was not a conditional dismissal, without prejudice, or

words to that effect, but a general one. A dismissal of the bill
under such directions is presumed to be upon the merits, unless

it be otherwise stated in the decree of dismissal.

It cannot be disputed that if the bill had been dismissed upon
the merits it would be conclusive against the right of the defendant in this action to set up in bar of plaintiff's recovery
any of the items of set-off and counter claim pleaded by defendant. He contends, however, that for the purpose of determining the ground upon which the bill was dismissed, it is proper
to resort to the opinion of the court, even though the record
show an absolute dismissal, and that the opinion in this case
shows the bill was not dismissed upon the merits, but only because of his (complainant's) laches in seeking the aid of a court
of equity to set aside and cancel the written assignment made
by the defendant herein to the plaintiff, and which, as the defundant alleges, was procured by fraud; that when relief was
denied on the ground of such laches, the only effect of the denial and the consequent dismissal of the bill was to leave the
complainant at full liberty to fight out the issue of fraud in this
action.
We do not think this is a correct statement of the case.
Assuming that defendant is right in his contention that he can
look at the opinion for the ground of dismissal, we think it
appears therefrom that the bill was in truth dismissed upon its
merits. The court really went into an elaborate examination
of the status of the complainant in the equity case with reference to his claim of right to avail himself of the alleged fraud,
not only in respect to his laches technically so-called, but also
with regard to his affirmative treatment of the defendant after
lic had, as this court decided, acquired full knowledge of all the
fact.s which constituted what he claimed to be the fraud in the
case. After he had acquired such knowledge, the complainant
deliberately decided to, and did, procure the defendant's check

Opinion of the Court.

for $15,000 or substitutes therefor which he had himself taken,
(the consideration given complainant for the sale) to be cashed,
and complainant used the money for his own purposes.

Not

only laches on the part of the complainant formed the bar to
the maintenance of the equity suit, but, as the court held, it was
his whole conduct relative to the transaction after it had been

completed, and his affirmance of the contract that precluded
any right on his part to recover for any alleged fraud. His
right to recover at all, upon the facts as found by the court from
the evidence, was passed upon and decided.
Some expressions may be found in the opinion tending to
show that the court was proceeding upon the ground merely of
the complainant's laches in failing to resort early enough to the
court for relief. But an examination of the whole of the opinion will show that the court was not confining itself to any
such narrow ground, and on the contrary was examining the
whole conduct of complainant, both his omissions and his affirmative and positive acts, for the purpose of determining whether
the complainant had any cause of action against the defendant.
For the purpose of such examination we make copious extracts
from that opinion. After a full statement of the case the opinion, as reported in 169 U. S. at page 196, proceeds as follows:
"The controverted issue arising from the foregoing unquestioned facts is this:
"Cummings claims that he did not derive knowledge of the
fraud he complains of from the matters just stated ; whilst Baker
asserts that if the fraud in the purchase complained of by Cummings had existed, full knowledge thereof was conveyed to
Cummings by the facts above stated, and that the silence of the
latter and his inaction for years, and until Baker had made claim
for money and stated his intention to dissolve partnership, not
only establishes the want of foundation for Cummings' assertion that there was misrepresentation and fraud in the sale, but
also makes clear the fact that the right to make such claim
was barred, both by limitations and laches, when the demand
of Cummings was actually preferred.
"It results from the foregoing that the facts as to the controverted matters are embraced in a narrow compass, and that

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

the whole case really resolves itself into two issues: 1st. Does
the proof establish that the purchase and sale in question was
as claimed by Cummings, or as asserted by Baker? In that
question is necessarily embraced the further one of whether
Cummings, at the time of the sale, had actual knowledge of the
fraudulent representations claimed to have been made by Baker.
This is, in terms, included, because it would be impossible in
reason to declare that one had been deluded or deceived by
misrepresentations into entering into a contract if he had actual
knowledge when the contract was made that the alleged inducing representations were false. 2d. Conceding that Cummings
was misled by the fraudulent representations of Baker as alleged,
did he immediately after the sale, and before the collection by
him of the cash consideration of the sale, discover that the representations were untrue, and thereby become aware that he
had been grossly deceived and defrauded, and did he, with such
knowledge, say nothing about the matter, collect the cash consideration, remain silent, and continue in partnership with Baker,
occupying the same office for years, and only assert that he had
been deceived when a dissolution of the partnership was threatened, and he was pressed to pay a sum which Baker claimed
Cummings owed him? This latter inquiry assumes a twofold
aspect, for although in the bill, in the opinions below, and in
the argument at bar, the efficient misrepresentation, which it is
asserted rendered the assignment void, was the fraudulent statement as to the sum of the fees on the claims then allowed and
appropriated for, nevertheless it is also, as we have seen, asserted
in the bill and contended in argument that there was a misrepresentation as to the pending claims not yet acted upon by
the Department, and which were then unappropriated for by
Congress.
"We will defer an examination of the testimony as to the
existence of the fraud and misrepresentation complained of until we have passed on the charge that, if there was fraud and
misrepresentation, Cummings had full knowledge thereof immediately after the sale. We adopt this order of consideration
because if it be found that such was the case, the question
whether the fraud originally existed will become immaterial,

OCTOBER TERM, 1900.
Opinion of the Court.

in view of the defences of limitation and laches. Moreover, in
reviewing the question of knowledge, we will do so in the order
stated, that is, first, discovery of the alleged fraud and misrepresentation as to the amount of fees collected and in process of
collection from claims appropriated for at the time of the sale;
and, second, discovery of the misrepresentation as to the amount
of pending claims from which further fees were expected.
Here, also, it is to be premised that if the first proposition be
found to be well taken, an examination of the second will be
wholly unnecessary. This, obviously, is the case, for, as the
statute of limitations began to run from the time when suit
might have been brought to annul the sale, it results that the
discovery of the falsity of any material and fraudulent representation by which the sale had been induced, gave rise to the
right to commence an action to rescind, and therefore fixed
the period when the statute of limitations commenced its
course."
And again on page 206:
"Our conclusion is, that the evidence not only clearly but
beyond all question or dispute overwhelmingly shows that if
the false representations as to the earned fees were made as
alleged, there was entire knowledge thereof by Cummings.
And, for reasons heretofore stated, this conclusion renders unnecessary any inquiry into the question of when Cummings discovered the falsity of the alleged representations as to the
amount of pending claims. . . . That Cummings might at
his election have pursued a remedy for the alleged fraud in a
court of law is obvious. And it is equally clear that such reinedy at law, by action on the case predicated on the facts as to
deceit and fraud, which are alleged in the bill now before us,
would have been barred in three years from the discovery of
the fraud under the Statute of Limitations of Maryland of 1715,
c. 23, s. 2, in force in the District of Columbia. 1 Kilty's Statutes, 111; Comp. Laws Dist. Col. c. 42, s. 6, p. 360. It hence
follows, irrespective of the equitable doctrine of laches, that
the relief which the bill seeks to obtain ought not to be allowed
by a court of equity.
"Apart, however, from the bar of the statute of limitations,

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

the facts as to the full knowledge of the fraud, if any existed,
by Cummings more than three years before the filing of his
tsill, and his conduct after he obtained it, his permitting Baker
to go on and prosecute the claims as if they were his own, debars Cummings from invoking a court of conscience to put him
in a much better position than he could possibly have occupied
if he had spoken and asserted his rights in due season.
"There cannot be a doubt that the right existed in Baker to
have dissolved the partnership at any time. If this right on his
part had been exercised, Cummings would not have been in a
position to have availed himself of the labors of Baker in
prosecuting the future claims to a successful culmination, and
would not therefore have been a participant in the profits arising therefrom. If with a full knowledge of the fraud Cummings chose to remain silent, to permit Baker to go on with
the prosecution of the claims, to incur the expenditure of time
and labor not only in the cases in which he was successful but
in the cases in which he failed, Cummings cannot in conscience
be allowed to reap the rewards which he could not possibly have
obtained had he spoken with reasonable promptness, when the
knowledge of the fraud, if it existed, was brought home to him
in the most pointed and unequivocal way."
And the court winds up the opinion with the following remark:
"Because we rest our conclusions upon the application of the
bar of the statute and the laches of Cummings, we must not be
considered as intimating that we conclude that there was either
clear and convincing proof, or even a preponderance of proof,
that the sale was as claimed by Cummings."
From this last extract it seems to be clear that the court had
in fact examined the evidence as to the alleged fraud and had
concluded it was not proved. The result of the whole opinion
is to say in substance that while we have read the evidence in
the case and do not think there is even a preponderance of it
in favor of a finding of fraud, yet notwithstanding that fact
we will place our judgment upon the ground that the evidence
shows the complainant has himself so acted in the case, both by
his neglect and, among other things, by his drawing the money

Opinion of the Court.

on the check, that he has affirmed the contract after he knew
all the facts upon which he now founds his allegation of fraud;
that he has waived the fraud and all benefit that he might otherwise have urged by reason of it. A waiver of all right to question the validity of a contract may be founded upon the claiming
and acceptance of a benefit under it after full knowledge of all
the facts. 2 Pom. Eq. Turis. 2d ed. see. 897, and cases cited in
note 1. From all this we think no other conclusion is accurate
than to say the decision of this court was based upon the merits
of the case within the meaning of that expression when used to
distinguish a decision of the court upon the merits from a decision based upon a lack of jurisdiction or defect of parties or anything of that nature. Here there was no lack of jurisdiction,
the parties were before the court, and full power to grant relief entirely commensurate with the plaintiff's rights existed
in the court. It is therefore incorrect to say that by the dismissal of the complainant's bill he has simply been remitted to
his less effective remedy at law. This is to ignore the weight
and effect of the opinion upon the matters just discussed and
to open for another contention a subject which we think the
decree in the equity case has closed for all time. It cannot be
that after the determination of an investigation such as has
been had in the equity case, and the entry of a decree thereon
dismissing the bill, the matter can again be opened for contest
in this action at law.
_For these reasons, we think the judgment of the Court of Ap_peals of the Districtof Columbia should be reversed and
the case remanded to that court with instructions to reinstate the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Districtin
favor of the plaintif,and it is so ordered.
