KEYSER v. FARR.

JAMES V. MCCORMACK.
An appeal, dismissed under rule 16, will not be reinstated, unless good cause
therefor be shown.

MOTION to reinstate an appeal from the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Western District of Virginia.

Mr. John Ambler Smith in support of the motion.
Mr. John WV. Johnston and 111r. John A. Campbell, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.

When the appellant was called and his appeal dismissed, the
case had been nearly three years on the docket of this court.
He had no brief on file, and was not present, either in person
or by counsel. Under these circumstances the appellees were
entitled, under Rule 16, to a dismissal. No notice of their intention to enforce the rule was necessary. The appellant has
not excused himself for his default, and his case is clearly within
that of lurley v. Jones (97 U. S. 318), in which we announced
our intention to enforce rigidly this salutary rule, and not to
set aside defaults growing out of the neglect of counsel or parties, except for very good cause.
Motion denied.

KEYSER v. FARR.
1. Where, after the allowance of an appeal, the required supersedeas bond was
duly approved and the cause entered here, the court below had no longer
any control over the decree, and its subsequent order vacating that allow.
ance is void.
2. Goddardv. Ordway (101 U. S. 745) distinguished.

APPEAL from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
Motion on the part of the appellants for a writ of supersedeas, and on the part of the appellees to dismiss.
Mr. A. C. Bradley and Mr'. West Steever for the appellants.
Mr. W. Hallett Phillips and Mr. William A. Maury for the
appellees.
