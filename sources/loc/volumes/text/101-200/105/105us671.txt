For these reasons, the act of Feb. 18, 1857, under which all
the bonds in suit purport to have been issued, must be held
to be of no force or effect, and the plaintiffs can maintain no
action on the bonds. Upon the attempt made at the argumelit
to support their validity in the first case under the statute
of Nov. 6, 1849, and in the second case under the statute of
March 6, 1867, it is enough to say that there is nothing in the
record to show that either of those statutes was ever complied
with by the defendant in issuing the bonds, or relied on by the
plain tiff in purchasing them.

1. The rules touching the effect of the findings of fact by the Court of Claims
do not apply to the hearing of an appeal from its adjudication on a claim
whereof it took cognizance under a special act of Congress, which required

determine the facts as well as the law applicable thereto.
2. The advertisement by the offiecr in comnand of the arsenal of the United

MR. JUSTicE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the
court.

On the 12th of May, 1869, General Rodman, in command of
the United States Arsenal at Rock Island, Illinois, caused to be
published the following advertisement, in pursuance of law:"PiROPOSALS

FOR 13RIDGE MASONRY.

Sealed proposals will be received at this arsenal up to 10 o'clock
A. M. on the twenty-fifth day of May, 1869, fbr the construction
of the piers and abutments of the railroad and wagon-road bridge
to be built to connect the island of Rock Island with the city of
Davenport. It is proposed to build, say, five comon piers, one
draw-pier, and two abutments. The stone and cement required for
the work will be furnished on railroad cars, on arsenal switch, near
the island end of the proposed bridge, and the sand required for
the cement will be furnished by the United States at or near the
same point. All the masonry must be of the best quality of bridge
masonry, the stones in each course must be well banded, and each
course well secured by dowels to the course below under cut-water,
and at lower end of piers, and the foundation courses must be fairly
bedded and well secured to the rock-bed of the river, the work as
it progresses being subject to the inspection and approval of the
commanding officer of the arsenal, or such other officer or person as
may be designated by proper authority. Detailed intbrmation with
regard to the general form and dimensions of the piers and abutments, and a profile of bed of river, can be obtained by personal
application at the arsenal. The total aniount of masonry is estimated at about 10,000 cubic yards. All the piers and abutments
will be required to be completed prior to the first day of December,
1869. Parties making bids will stato the price per cubic yard of
solid, masonry at which they are willing to complete the work, the
United States furnishing the stone, cement, and sand, as above
stipulated, and nothing more. They will also make a bid stating
separately the price per cnbic yard of' solid masonry at which they
will undertake to build the piers and abutments, the United States
firnishing the stone, cement, and sand, as above, :and the price at
which they will agree to put in the necess:ary coffer-dams with
their protections. Proposals will be indorsed I Proposals for Bridge

ing date June 1, 1869. The following are the provisions of
the contract which are material to this ease: " The parties of
the first part do hereby contract and engage with the said
United States to construct the piers and abutments for the new
rail and wagon bridge, to be built to connect the island of
Rock Island with the city of Davenport, in accordance with
such plans and specifications as may be fixed by proper authority acting for the United States; the United States to furnish
stone, cement, sand, and all necessary templets required for
the work, and nothing more ; the stone and cement to be delivered in cars at the government switch on the island, near

if any default shall be made by the parties of the first part in

in that case, the United States shall have the right to take
entire and exclusive charge of the work, and to complete it in
accordance with the conditions prescribed by this contract,
charging us with the entire cost of completing it, and crediting
us with the amount per cubic yard heretofore stipulated to be
paid us for the completing of the work."
On the 14th of December, 1870, the appellants filed a petition in the Court of Claims praying a judgment against the
United States for $200,400. The petition set forth that the con-

tract was one for doing the masonry work in and about the
construction of the piers and abutments; that proposals were
invited for said work, and also separate proposals for putting
in the necessary coffer-dams and their protections, but the petitioners bid only for said masonry work in the construction of
said piers and abutments; and that their bid, being the lowest
one for said masonry work, was accepted, and the contract
was awarded thereon. The petition made the following claims,
by items, against the United States: 1. For damages incurred
by reason of the unreasonable delay caused by defendants from
June 7, 1869, to Sept. 4, 1869, $25,000; 2. For putting in
coffer-dams and protections, for pumping the water therefrom,
and for preparing the beds for the piers and abutments, q$75,000;
3. For loss of profits incurred by the unlawful reduction of the
dimensions of the piers and abutments, 933,600 ; 4. For increase in the cost of the work, by having been compelled to
do it in cold weather, $15,000 ; 5. For constructing 4,400 cubic
yards of masonry, at, say, 812 per yard, 952,800 ; 6. For loss
caused by neglect of defendants to furnish materials and locate
piers and abutments, whereby the plaintiffs, their workmen and
tools, were kept idle, $15,000 ; 7. For loss of machinery, vessels,
and tools, caused by the ejeetment of the plaintiffs from the
work, $25,000; 8. For dressing coping and corners of abutments, and dressing noses of piers under water, not required
by contract, $5,000. This made a total of $246,400, on which
$46,000 was credited as paid, leaving a balance of $200,400.
The petition contained allegations bearing upon each one of
the eight items claimed, but it is not necessary here to refer to
any but those in respect to items 2 and 3, which allegations
were as follows: " That about the thirteenth day of September,
1869, the United States having furnished materials sufficient to
commence the construction of said piers and abutments, the
petitioners requested the agent of the defendants to put in, or
cause to be put in, the necessary coffer-dams and to pump the water therefrom, and prepare beds for said piers and abutments, to
enable petitioners to proceed with time performance of their contract. But the United States refused to put in such coffer-dams
and pump the water therefrom, and refused to prepare said beds,
pretending that petitioners were bound, under said contract, to

HARVEY V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct,

put in said coffer-dams. The petitioners thereupon protested
against such wrongful construction of said contract, but, at the
special request of the defendants, and relying upon the good
faith of the United States, they undertook to and did put in
the necessary coffer-dams and protections, and pump the water
therefrom, and did prepare the beds for said piers and abutments. That the labor and materials expended in putting in
said coffer-dams and protections, and pumping water and preparing beds as aforesaid, was reasonably worth, and they are
entitled to recover for the same from the United States, the
sum of seventy-five thousand dollars. That they were informed
by the United States, prior to the making of said proposal, that
the draw-pier would be four hundred and seventy-four feet long
and fifty-six feet wide, and that the five common piers would
be each seventy-four feet long and fourteen feet wide, and that,
with the abutments, there would not be less than ten thousand
cubic yards of masonry work, and that petitioners based their
estimates for said work upon such information, and made their
said proposal in the belief that said piers and abutments would
be constructed according to such dimensions. But they allege
that the defendants, on or about the twenty-second day of July,
1869, transferred the supervision of said work from the Ordnance
Bureau to the Bureau of Engineers, and that the petitioners,
although they were at all times ready and anxious to proceed
with said work, were kept waiting from the seventh day of June,
1869, until September Tth, 1869, as aforesaid, and that, on or
about the said seventh day of September, 1869, the defendants
marked out the location for one pier and one abutment only,
and wrongfully reduced the dimensions of all the said piers and
abutments, so that, instead of measuring ten thousand cubic
yards, they measured only about six thousand five hundred;
and that, by reason of said reduction, by said defendants, in
the dimensions of said piers and abutments, the petitioners
have been damaged in the full sum of thirty-three thousand
six hundred dollars."
Subsequently the petitioners amended their petition as to
item 5, so as to make it read as follows: " For handling, cutting, preparing, and setting stone for and in the piers and abutments, $82,000." The United States, by answer, denied every

ITARVEY V. UNITED STATES.

allegation in the petition, and set up a counterclaim for $33,681.35, alleging that, under the contract, the petitioners being
in default, the United States took charge of the work and
completed it, and charged the petitioners with the entire cost
of completing it, $142,457.17, and credited them with the
amount per cubic yard stipulated in the contract to be paid
them for completing the work, $108,775.82, leaving a balance
due to the United States from the petitioners of $33,681.35.
Proofs were taken, and the case was heard by the Court of
Claims. It awarded to the petitioners $20,068 in respect of
items 1 and 6. As to item 2, the court found that it was necessary, in order to the laying of the abutments and piers, that a
coffer-dam should be built for each abutment and pier, and the
water pumped out of it, and the bed of the river prepared for
laying the masonry of the abutment or pier thereon ; that without such coffer-dams it was impracticable to construct any of the
abutments or piers; that the petitioners, on the 13th of September, 1869, requested the United States to forthwith construct
the requisite coffer-dams, exhaust the water therefrom, and
prepare the bed for the piers and abutments where necessary
for tme commencement of the work; that the United States, on
the next day, refused so to do, on the ground that, under the
contract, it was the business of the petitioners to do the work
that on the next day the petitioners protested against such
refusal, and notified the United States that they should proceed at once to build the dams, pumnp the water therefrom,
and prepare the beds, and should hold the United States for
the payment of the costs and expenses of the same ; that on the
next day General Warren, in charge of the construction of the
bridge, consented, in order not to delay the work, to its going
on until the matter could be referred to the Attorney-General
of the United States, but stated that in such consent it must be
considered that nothing was admitted in favor of the claim of
the petitioners to their interpretation of the contract ; that, immediately upon such refusal of the United States, the petitioners proceeded to build the requisite coffer-dams ; and that all
that was required in that respect while the work was in their
hands was done by them. But the court found, as a conelusion
of law, that the contract did not require the United States, but

HARVEY V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

required the petitioners, to do the work named in item 2. As
to item 3, the court found that about the 17th of July, 1869,
General Rodman was relieved from the charge of the construction of the bridge by General Warren, of the corps of engineers; that General Warren, on the 22d of August, 1869,
caused notice to be given to the petitioners that the position
of the abutment and first pier of the bridge, on the Iowa side,
was determined and marked, ready for them to commence their
construction ; that, when proposals were so invited by advertisement, General Rodman had prepared certain plans of the
bridge, intended to show the general forms and dimensions of
the piers and abutments, and a profile of the bed of the river;
that those plans were seen and inspected by the petitioners
before they sent in their said proposal ; that the dimensions of
the piers of the bridge which were fixed upon on the 22d of
August, 1869, and those which were, after that date, from
time to time fixed upon, were less than the dimensions indicated in the plans prepared by General Rodman and shown to
the petitioners before they made their said proposal; but that
there was no reduction of the sizes which were fixed upon on
the last-named day, nor was there any reduction of the sizes
thereafter adopted. The court found, however, as a conclusion
of law, that the reduction made in the dimensions of the pier's
and abutments of the bridge, as originally projected, was not,
by the legal construction of the contract, wrongful to the petitioners. As to item 4, the court found that the petitioners
were not subjected to any increase in the cost of the work by
having been compelled to do it in cold weather. The court
also found that on the 6th of October, 1870, the petitioners
were notified in writing by the officer in charge of the work on
the bridge, that in consequence of complaints which had reached
the chief of engineers of the United States army, of the tardy
progress of the work on the masonry of the bridge, the said
officer had been required to take suitable and efficient ineasures to expedite the work, and that, in view of that requireinent, he would take the work as it stood and carry it on under
the provision of the contract which contemplated such a change;
that on the next day the petitioners, in writing, refused to
give up the work, whereupon, on that day, the said officer

Oct. 1881.]

HARVEY V. UNITED

STATES.

notified them in writing that he would on the next day take
possession of the work for the government, which he did,
against the assent and protest of the petitioners ; and that
thenceforward the work was prosecuted by the officers of the
government. In regard to item 5, as amended, the court found
that the petitioners, before their ejectment from the work, had
done work upon and for the bridge, nnder the contract, to the
amount of $76,344.47, and had been paid on account of said
work $54,105.98, leaving due to them tnder item 5, $22,238.49.
As to item 7, the court found that the petitioners did not sustain any damage by reason of the idleness of their tools, machinery, and vessels, after Oct. 8, 1870, which they would not
have sustained had they on that day completed their work
nnder the contract, or which was not incident to the termination, at any time, of their work under the contract. As to
item 8, the court found that the petitioners Vere paid in full
for all the extra work they did on or about the abutments an([
piers of the bridge. The court awarded to the petitioners
$42,306.49, being $20,068 on account of items 1 and 6, and
$22,238.49 on account of item 5, and rejected their claims
under items 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The opinion of the Court of Claims, in deciding the case, is
found in 8 Ct. of Cl. 501. From that it appears that, in regard to item 2, the court held that neither the advertisement
nor the bid could he invoked to interpret the contract; and
that the proper construction of the contract was that it was
the duty of the petitioners to build the coffer-dams, pump the
water therefrom, and prepare the bed of the river for the piers
and abutments which they were bound to construct. In tegard to item 3, the court held that under the contract the officer in charge had the power to make the alterations in the
dimensions of the piers which made the profits to the petitioners less.
The Court of Claims 'having no equitable jurisdiction to
reform a contract, the petitioners acquiesced in the decision
made, so far as not to take an appeal to this court, and to receive payment from the United States of the amount of time
judgment for $42,306.49 ; but they applied to Congress, and
procured the passage of the ace of Aug. 14, 1876, c. 279 (19

HARVEY V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Stat. 490), which provides as follows: "That the claim of
James W. Harvey and James Livesey for alleged labor done
and materials furnished under their contract with the United
States for the building of the masonry-work for the piers and
abutments of the bridge across the Mississippi River from
Rock Island to Davenport, Iowa, bearing date June first,
eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, be, and the same is hereby,
referred to the Court of Claims, for hearing and adjudication;
and to that end jurisdiction is hereby conferred on said court
to proceed in the adjustment of the accounts between said
claimants and the United States, as a court of equity jurisdiction ; and may, if according to the rules and principles of
equity jurisprudence, in its judicial discretion, reform said contract and render such judgment as justice and right between
the claimants and the said government may require."
On the 30th of August, 1.876, the petitioners filed in the
Court of Claims a petition, which recites the former proceedings, and the judgment, and its payment, and the contents of
the said act of Congress, and then proceeds as follows : " The
plaintiffs allege that there is still justly due to them from the
United States a large sum of money for damages and for work
and materials, and, in addition to the charges made in the
aforesaid original petition, they say that connected with the
pivot-pier of said bridge there were large walls of stone masonry and crib-work, connecting the upper and lower rests of
the pivot-pier with the pivot thereof, which were constructed
mainly of irregular or rip-rap masonry, and that, to finish the
abutment on the Iowa shore, wing-walls, constructed of riprap ' masonry, were necessary, all of which was a part of the
plaintiffs' work under the contract; that, this work being
cheap and easily done, the officers in charge of said work in
behalf of the United States refused to permit the plaintiffs to
do it, and employed laborers and constructed the same for the
United States, and thus unjustly and unlawfully deprived th
plaintiffs of large profits, which they otherwise would have
made. They allege that they could have made, on the said
work, the sum Of $51,000 in profits. The plaintiffs aver that
there is justly and equitably due to them from the United
States, on account of the premises, and in addition to the

Oct. 1881.]

O ARVEY V. UNITED

STATES.

amount already paid to them, the sum of $239,600, with interest, according to the following specifications, to wit: 1.
For labor done, and materials furnished by the plaintiffs, in
constructing the coffer-dams, and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith, and, preliminary to the masonrywork for said piers and abutments, $75,000; 2. For loss and
damages resulting to the claimants in consequence of the reduction of the dimensions of the piers and abutments, made
subsequently to the making of the contract, $33,600 ; 3. For
loss of machinery, vessels, and tools, caused by taking from the
plaintiffs the work under their contract, $25,000 ; 4. For extra
work, dressing coping and corners of abutments, and dressing
noses of piers under water (this work not being required by
the contract), $5,000; 5. For the profits they could have made
bad they been permitted to build the cross-walls and crib-work
connecting the upper and lower rests with the pivot (part of
the contract), 848,000 ; 6. For profits they might have made
bad they been permitted to construct tile wing-walls for tile
Iowa shore abutment ; these walls were ' rip-rap,' and a part of
the work under the contract, out of which liberal profits could
have been made; the agents of the United States performed
the work, $3,000 ; 7. For profits they might have made had
they been permitted to complete the work according to the
intention of the parties and the terms of the contract, in addition to the foregoing charges, $50,000 ; 8. For interest on the
amount found due to the claimants on an equitable adjustment
of accounts between the parties, from October 6th, 1870, until
the date of the judgment of this court, at the rate of six per
centum per annum. The petitioners therefore claim judgment
against tie United States for the sum of t$239,600, with interest thereon at six per centuni per annum ; and they pray the
court to reform the said contract, if the same be necessary, so
as to make the same conform to the intention of the parties
and to be in consonance with justice and equity, and for such
other and further or general relief as in justice and right they
may be 'entitled to have." The United States demurred to
this petition on the ground that it did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court sustained the
demurrer and gave leave to the petitioners to amend the peti-

HARVEY v. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

tion. 12 Ct. of Cl. 141. One of the grounds on which the court
proceeded was, that so far as the demands covered by the new
petition are legal demands, under the contract, enforceable in a
suit at law founded on the contract, such demands cannot, under
the special act of Congress, come under the cognizance of the
court. This view is, in our judgment, correct. The court
further held, that there were no averments in the petition
showing a title to equitable relief founded on the view that the
written contract did not set forth the true agreement, and no
facts alleged showing a right to recover on the reformed agreement. It was held that the court was to proceed simply " as
a court of equity jurisdiction," and that the accounts which it
could adjust and the relief which it could give must be limited
to matters which, because of its inability to sit as a court of
equity, it could not and did not before determine.
A comparison of the new petition with the first petition
shows that items 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the new petition are severally
reproductions of items 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the first petition ; that
items 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the new petition are entirely new ; and
that items 1, 4, 5, and 6 in the first petition are not reproduced
in the new petition, an award having been made in the judgment in respect of items 1, 5, and 6 in the first petition, and
item 4 therein being abandoned.
The petitioners proceeded, under the leave granted, to amend
their petition in equity, by adding thereto the following allegations: "1The contract mentioned in the original petition in this
cause was intended to cariy out and execute the specifications
and agreements contained in a certain advertisement or invitation for proposals for constructing the piers and abutments of
the said bridge, published by the defendants, and in a bid made
in pursuance thereof by the plaintiffs. The agents of the
United States, by said advertisement, requested the persons
bidding in pursuance thereof to state (1) the price per cubic
yard of solid masonry at which they were willing to complete
the work; (2) the price per cubic yard of solid masonry at
which they were willing to build the piers and ahutments ; and
(3) the price at which they were willing to put in the necessary
coffer-dans and protections. The said invitation for proposals
also apprised the bidders that detailed information as to the

Oct. 1881.]

HARVEY

V. UNITED

STATES.

general form and dimensions of the piers and abutments, and a
profile of the bed of the river, would be exhibited to them at
the arsenal. In pursuance of that part of the said invitation
which referred to the work of building the solid masonry of the
piers and abutments, and after having first obtained from the
defendants' agents detailed information touching the form and
dimensions of the proposed piers and abutnicnts, and after having examined the profile of the bed of the river exhibited by
the defendants, the plaintiffs, on the twenty-fifth day of May,
1869, submitted to the proper officers of the United States a
proposal in writing, whereby they offered to build (only) the
masonry of the said piers and abutments, upon the terms following, to wit, the small piers and abutments at and for the
sum of eleven dollars per yard, and the draw-pier at and for
the sum of thirteen dollars per yard. The said proposal was
accepted by the defendants, and the said contract, in the original petition described, was prepared in the office of the agent
of the United States, by a clerk therein employed, but, in consequence of accidemnt and mistake, the said contract was so
drawn as to depart from the intention of the parties and from
the terms and specifications in said invitation and proposal
contained. Instead of requiring the plaintiffs to perform the
labor and furnish the materials contemplated by the said invitation and proposal, and in the manner specified therein, the
language employed in said contract inequitably required the
plaintiffs 'to construct the said piers and abutments in accordance with such plans and specifications as may (might) be
fixed by proper authority acting for the United States.' The
plaintiffs did not discover the peculiar language of the said contract until long after the work had been in progress, nor (lid
they ever believe that they were bound by said contract to do
any more work, or furnish any more materials, or that they
were obliged to perform the work in any other manner, than
as specified and contemplated in the said invitation and proposal, until the judgment of this court compelled them to submit
to said construction. When the officers of the defendants first
claimed for the said contract the strict construction aforesaid,
the plaintiffs protested, and refused to proceed any further with
the work, but the said officers, by promises (which they never

kept), induced the plaintiffs to go on, notwithstanding the dispute, and they accordingly did proceed, and they were required
by the agents of the United States to construct the coffer-dams
and do all other work and furnish all other materials preliminary to building the solid masonry for said piers and abutments,
and to construct said piers and abutments on very materially
different plans and in different localities from those contemplated by the parties at the time of making said proposal, and
said piers and abutments so built were, in consequence of the
alterations in the form and locality thereof, much more expensive to the plaintiffs, for which no allowance has ever been made
to them. Through the error and mistake aforesaid, the defendants were given an unfair and unconscionable advantage over
the plaintiffs, and have obtained the materials, labor, alad skill
of the plaintiffs, of great value, and have paid nothing for
them. The labor performed and the materials furnished by
the plaintiffs for the United States, in putting in said cofferdams and furnishing the other materials and performing the
other work preliminary to building the masonry of said piers
and abutments, were reasonably worth the sum of seventy-five
thousand dollars ; and the work done and materials furnished
by them for the United States in and about the masonry of
said piers anil abutments were reasonably worth, in consequence
of the change of locality and of plans and specifications unlawfully made by the defendants under thie erroneous provisions of
said contract, the sum of thirty-three thousand and six hundred
dollars, over and above the sums which the plaintiffs have already been paid therefor. The plaintiffs, therefore, pray that
the said contract may be so reformed as to correspond with the
intention of the parties, and that they may be paid for the labor and materials by them performed and furnished upon the
said bridge. They further pray that they may have such other
and further relief, and be paid such other and further sums of
money, as may be agreeable to equity and good conscience, and
as the provisions of said act of Congress may authorize and
require."
By leave of the court, the petitioners filed a second amendment to the petition in equity, stating as follows, in addition
to what was contained in said petition and the first amendment

thereto "First, By the terms of the advertisement inviting
proposals, the proposal of the plaintiffs, and the acceptance
thereof by the defendants, as alleged in the original petition
herein and the amendment thereto, a preliminary agreement
was made between the plaintiffs and the defendants, by which
the plaintiffs agreed to build the masonry-work of the piers and
abutments of the said bridge at Rock Island, for the prices
stated in the said original petition and the amendment thereto,
and according to certain plans showing the general form and
dimensions of the piers and abutments and their locations in the
river, and according to a profile showing the bed of the river
at the place where the work was to be done, which plans and
profile were, before the making of the proposal, exhibited by
the defendants to the plaintiffs, and were by them inspected,
to enable them to prepare their estimates for making their said
proposal. And the United States thereby agreed to furnish
the stone, cement, and sand for said masonry, and also to erect
and put in the necessary coffer-dams, with their protections,
and to perform the preliminary work necessary to enable the
plaintiffs to build the said masonry-work according to their
said proposal and according to said general plans, and at the
location in the river indicated by said plans and profile. Second, For the purpose and with the intent and design of carrying into effect said agreement thus made as aforesaid, a formal
contract was prepared by officers of the United States, which
was afterwards signed and delivered by both parties; but, by
accident and mistake, the said contract did not conform to the
terms of said previous agreement, nor to the intention of tile
parties. The said contract was, by such accident and mistake,
so drawn as to impose upon the plaintiffs the burthen and expense of constructing and putting in the necessary coffer-dams

with their protections, and of performing the preliminary work
connected therewith, instead of requiring the United States to
put in said coffer-dams and perform said preliminary work, as
had been previously agreed upon, and as was intended by the
parties. The cost of constructing and putting in said cofferdams with their protections and doing the preliminary work
connected therewith, was as great if not greater than the cost
of building the masonry-work, and, in consequence of the said

HARVEY V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

accident and mistake, the United States obtained an unconscionable advantage over the defendants, and compelled them
to do work and furnish materials which they never intended to
do, and for one-half the compensation the said work and materials were really worth. And the said contract, through accident and mistake, was so drawn as to require the plaintiffs to
build the said piers and abutments in accordance with such
plans and specifications as might be fixed by the officers of the
United States, instead of requiring the United States to provide
plans, and the plaintiffs to do their work, according to the general plans and profile exhibited to the plaintiffs, as aforesaid,
and at the location in the river agreed upon, as was the intention of the parties, and as had been previously agreed upon by
the parties. And the defendants, through said accident and
mistake, have obtained an inequitable and unconscionable advantage over the plaintiffs, and, in the construction of the said
bridge, changed its locality further down the river and in~to
deep water, and reduced the dimensions of the piers and abutments as prescribed by said original plans, in sulch a manner as
to preserve the cut-stone or expensive portion of the work, and
to greatly reduce the quantity of rough, inexpensive work,
through which alone profit could be derived by the plaintiffs,
and thereby inflicted great injury upon the plaintiffs. The petitioners submit to the court that they are entitled to have said
contract reformed, so as to nake it conform to the intention
and to the agreement of the parties, as expressed in the said
invitation for proposals and the bid of the plaintiffs submitted
in response thereto, and the acceptance thereof by the defendants, and to have the same judgment and relief as to the said
coffer-dams and the work of constructing the piers and abut.ments as if the said formal contract had conformed to the said
preliminary agreement and had contained the necessary provisions requiring the defendants to construct and put in the
necessary coffer-dams and to perform the preliminary work
connected therewith, and so as to conform in all things in reference to the construction of the said bridge and piers and
abutments, to the said original and general plans of said bridge,
and to the profile of said river-bed, and to the location thereby
indicated. And the petitioners claim such other and further

relief in the premises as their case may require, and as may be
authorized by the terms of the said act of Congress passed for
their relief."
The United States, by answer, denied all the allegations of
the petition and the amendments. The evidence in the first
case was used as evidence in the second case, and no new evidence was taken. The court entered a general finding in favor
of the defendants and dismissed the petition. From the decree
of dismissal the petitioners have appealed to this court.
The reasons assigned for that decree are contained in the
opinion of the Court of Claims, whicli is a part of the record,
and is also reported in 18 Ct. of Cl. 222. The court says, that
because of the decision on the demurrer it regards the present
proceedings as relating only to the claims for the cost of the
coffer-dams and for the loss of profits resulting from the reduction of the dimensions of the piers and abutments, being items
1 and 2 in the new petition. In regard to item 1, the decision
is that the petitioners have not shown that the written contract does not express the intent of both parties as to the coffer-dams ; and that even if the court were satisfied that, tho
petitioners executed the contract in mistake of their righits,
there is no evidence that the defendants shared the mistake.
In regard to item 2, the decision is that the court would be
disposed to regard the case, on the facts, as one for equitable
interposition for the purpose of further inquiry, and the ascertainuent of the rights of the parties in equity, if it had jurisdiction ; but that the statute does not authorize it to entertain
those considerations, because in these proceedings it can hear
and determine only claims for labor done and materials furnished by the plaintiffs under their contract with the defendants.
In regard to the coffer-dams, it seems clear to us that the
ruling of the Court of Claims was erroneons. The advertisement begins by inviting proposals for the construction of the
piers and abutments of the bridge. Standing alone, this would
involve proposals to make coffer-dams, and do and furnish
everything else necessary to finished work. But this is qualified by what follows. The advertisement goes on to say that
parties making bids will state (1) the price per cubic yaIrd of

H AiVEY V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

solid masonry at which they are willing "to complete the
work," the United States furnishing the stone, cement, and
sand, "and nothing more." "To complete the work" there
means to construct the piers and abutments complete, including the making of coffer-dams and 'doing and furnishing everything necessary for completed work, except furnishing stone,
cement, and sand, the United States furnishing those, and furnishing nothing more. Then parties making bids are " also"
to make a bid stating (2) separately the price per cubic yard
of solid masonry at which they will undertake to build the
piers and abutments, the United States furnishing stone, cement, and sand; and " also " to make a bid stating (3) separately the price at which they will agree to put in the necessary
coffer-dams, with their protections. Here are three distinct
classes of bids: bid 1 for the whole work, including all that is
embraced in the work specified in bids 2 and 3; bid 2 for a
part-of the whole work specified in bid 1 and excluding what
is embraced in bid 3; and bid 3 for another part of the whole
work specified in bid 1 and excluding what is embraced in
bid 2. There is no implication in the advertisement from the
use of the word "also," or from any other language, that a bidder could not make bid 2 or bid 3 unless he likewise put in a
bid for bid 1 ; or that he could not bid for the specified parts of
the work unless he should bid for the whole complete. The
appellants did not make a bid for the work complete, or say in
their bid that they were willing to complete the work. They
bid only under bid 2. They stated separately, in their bid, the
price per yard at which they would build the masonry of the
piers and abutments. 'They excluded bid 3 and the cofferdams, and they excluded bid 1 and the coffer-dams in it. This
is quite enough to determine the question. The written bid in
connection with the advertisement, and the acceptance of that
bid, constituted the contract between the parties, so far as regards the question whether the contract prices embraced the
coffer-dam work. Garfielde v. United States, 93 U. S. 242;
Equitable Insurance Co. v. Iearne, 20 Wall. 494. The written
contract, in that respect, was intended by both parties to be
merely a reduction to form of the statement as to work and
prices contained in the bid. If the formal contract is suscep-

tible of a different construction, to the prejudice of the contractors, it is very plain that not only the contractors but the
officers of the government were under a mistake. It is shown
that the work of making and putting in the coffer-dams, and
doing whatever else was necessary, in connection with them,
before the laying of the masonry could be commenced, was so
expensive as to make it impossible that the prices named in
the bid of the appellants could have covered that expense and
the laying of the masonry also. There is no evidence to show
that the parties intended to alter the terms of the bid as to
work and prices. There are other considerations dwelt upon
in the dissenting opinion of Judge Nott in the Court of Claims,
and to which it is necessary only to refer, which enforce the
conclusion thus reached. One of those considerations is, the
terms of the only other bid, as showing by the prices therein
named for bid 1, bid 2, and bid 3, each separately, that the appellants could not have been bidding for the work complete.
The evidence on the point in question on the part of the appellants is largely in documents, while that relied on by the
United States is oral, and some of it consists of recollections
of conversations with the appellants, who are debarred by statute from being witnesses in their own behalf. We are of
opinion that by the actual contract between the parties the
appellants were not to do any of the work covered by the claim
made by them under item 1 of the petition herein, and that
the written contract must be reformed accordingly.
We are also of opinion that the Court of Claims placed too
limited a construction upon the special act of Congress. The
act speaks of the claim of the appellants as a claim " for alleged
labor done and materials, furnished under their contract with
the United States for the building of the masonry-work for
the piers and abutments of the bridge," giving the date of the
contract. The Court of Claims had rejected item 2 in the first
case because the formal written contract required the petitioners to do the work named in it. It had rejected item 3
because that contract gave the government power to reduce
the dimensions of the piers and abutments. It was to obtain
equitable relief in respect to those two items that the appellants applied to Congress. Their claim had been made in the
VOL. XV.

RTATES.

[Sup. Ct.

eight items embraced in their petition in the first case. It had
been made as a claim under their contract. It cannot be properly inferred, unless there is language necessarily leading to a
contrary conclusion, that the claim referred to the Court of
Claims by the act is to emnbrace less than what was embraced
in items 2 and 3 in the first case, although item 3 is made out
as for " loss of profits." The act refers " the claim
the contract," for hearing and adjudication; and jurisdiction
is conferred on the court to proceed in the adjustment of "the
accounts" between the persons making the claim and the
United States, as a court of equity jurisdiction. The court
had decided that it could not take cognizance of item 3 because
it was not a court of equity jurisdiction, and, therefore, could
not proceed to adjust the accounts any further than it had
adjusted them. One object of the act was to remedy this
defect. There is nothing in the use of the words " for alleged
labor done and materials furnished," or of the words " to that
end," which can limit or control the scope of the act, as above
explained. That scope is still further shown by the enactment
that the court "may, if according to the rules and principles
of equity jurisprudence, in its judicial discretion, reform said
contract and render such judgment as justice and right between
the claimants and the said government may require." The
words " for alleged labor done and materials furnished " are, in
view of the language of the entire act, not words of limitation,
but words of description. The court is authorized to adjust
"the accounts " between the parties, so far as they were not
legal demands, and so far as they were equitable demands,
unadjusted or unadjudicated, growing out of the contract, as a
court of equity, and, for that purpose, to reform the contract,
according to the principles of equity, and then render judgment upon it as reformed. This power of the Court of Claims,
under the act, extends to reforming the contract in respect to
permitting the officers of the United States to materially vary
the plans for the piers so as to essentially change the obligations of the parties.
As to items 3 and 4 in the new petition, which are the same
as items 7 and 8 in the former case, not only were they legal
demands, but they'were adjudicated upon fully in that case and
"...under

cannot be reopened. As to items 5, 6, and 7 in the new petition, they cannot, in view of the principles laid down in this
opinion, be considered by the Court of Claims. The question
of interest, under item 8, remains for that court to consider.
It is contended on the part of the United States that this
court cannot, under its rules, hear this appeal, because there is
not, in the record, any finding by the Court of Claims of the
facts in the case, in the nature of a special verdict, with a separate statement of the conclusions of law upon such facts.
But the rule in regard to findings of fact has no reference to
a case like the present, of equity jurisdiction conferred in a
special case by a special act; and, in such a case, where an
appeal lies and is taken under sect. 707 of the Revised Statutes, this court must review the facts and the law as in other
cases in equity, appealed from other courts.
Judgment and decree reversed, and the case is remanded with
directions to proceed in it according to law and in conformity with the opinion of this court.
