BAYLIS v. TRAVELLERS' INSURANCE COMPANY.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRoIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Argued January 5, 185.-Decided February 2, 1885.
When parties do not waive the right of trial by jury, the court may not substitute itself for a jury, by passing upon the effect of the evidence--finding
the facts-and rendering judgment thereon.
At the trial of this case, after close of the testimony, defendant moved to dismiss on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict.
This motion being denied, plaintiff asked that the case be submitted to the
jury to determine the facts on the evidence. The court refused this, and
plaintiff excepted. The court then ordered a verdict for plaintiff,. subject
to its opinion, whether the facts proved were sufficient to render defendant
liable to plaintiff on the cause of action stated. Plaintiff moved for judgment on the verdict, and defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings
and minutes of trial. Judgment was rendered for defendant, upon an
opinion of the court as to the effect of the evidence, and as to the law on the
facts as deduced from it by the court: Held, That the plaintiff was thereby
deprived of his constitutional right to a trial by'jury, which he had not
'waived, and to which he was entitled.

This was an action brought by the plaintiff in error to recover upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendant,
whereby it insured William Edward Parker Baylis, the father
of the plaintiff, in the sum of $10,000, to be paid to the plain:
tiff, in case said assured should accidentally sustain bodily
injuries which should produce death, within ninety days.
The complaint alleged that the assured, "on or about the
20th day of Novefiber, 1872, did sustain bodily injuries accidentally, to wit, in that wholly by accident he took certain
drugs and medicines, which, as taken by him, were poisonous
and deadly, when, in fact, he intended to take wholly a different thing and in a different manner; and that, in consequence
of said accident solely, said assured died on said 20th day of
November, 1872."
An issue was made by a denial in the answer of this allega-

tion, so far as it alleged that the poisonous and deadly drugs
were taken "accidentally, or by accident, or with the intent,
or under the circumstances stated or mentioned in the complaint."
The cause came on for trial by jury, when, as appears by the
bill of exceptions, the plaintiff put in evidence the policy of insurance, proved the fact and circumstances of death, and notice
thereof to the defendant, and it was conceded that the question of suicide was not raised by the evidence.
The testimony being closed, the counsel for the defendant
moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the evidence
was insufficient to sustain a verdict. This motion was denied,
and thereupon the plaintiff's counsel insi'sted "that the evidence
presented questions of fact which ought to be submitted to the
jury, and asked that the case be submitted to the jury to determine upon the evidence."
The bill of exceptions further stated, that "the court refused
to submit the cause to the jury, and the plaintiff's counsel duly
excepted."
The court then directed the jury to render a, verdict for the
plaintiff for the full amount claimed, subject to the opinion of
the court upon the question whether the facts proved were
sufficient to render the defendants liable upon their policy, and
the jury accordingly rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for the
amount sued for, with interest.
The plaintiff moved for judgment upon the veidict, and the
defendant moved for judgment in its favor, on the pleadings
and minutes of trial.
Judgment was accordingly rendered for the defendant upon
the opinion of the judge, a copy of which is set out in the
record, and is as follows:
"1This action is brought upon a policy of insurance against
accident, issued by the defendants, whereby they agree to pay
to the plaintiff the sum of $10,000 'within ninety days after
sufficient proof that the insured, William E. P. Baylis, at any
time within the continuance of the policy, shall have sustained
bodily injuries effected through external, violent, and accidental means, within the intent and meaning of this contract

and the conditions hereunto annexed, and such injuries alone
shall have occasioned death within ninety days from the happening thereof.' The contract contained the following proviso: 'Provided,That this insurance shall not extend to any
death or disability which may have been caused wholly or in
part by apy surgical operation or medical or mechanical treatment for disease.' The cause was tried before the court and a
jury, when, upon the evidence adduced, a verdict for the plaintiff was directed, subject to the opinion of the court upon the
question whether the facts proved were sufficient to render the
defendants liable upon their policy. The following are the
facts as d~rived from the evidence, and in stating them I adopt
the conclusions of fact most favorable to the plaintiff that the
evidence will permit to be drawn: The insured died on -the
20th of November, 1872. A week or so previous to his death
he was suffering from influenza, the result of a cold, and was
then treated therefor by his physician. He began to get better, when, on Friday night before his death, he had an attack of cholera morbus, accompanied with c6nvulsions, which
seemed to. completely shatter his nervous system, and left him
in a wholly nervous state. On Monday following he was again
better, proposed to go to business, and asked his physician, on
account of restlessness, to give him some opiate for a quiet
night's sleep. The physician ordered a preparation of opium,
and directed him to take twenty drops of it before going to
bed. He was at this time taking chloral, under the same medical advice, and the opium was directed to be taken in addition
to a prescribed dose of chloral. That night the insured took
the prescribed dose of chloral, and as may be inferred from the
facts shown, a dose of opium also. There is no direct evidence as to the quantity of opium he took, but I shall treat the
case as if the evidence respecting the symptoms that followed,
and the actions of the insured, was sufficient to warrant a jury
in finding that, through inadvertence, the insured took more
opium than he intended to take, and such a quantity that his
death was caused thereby. It is by no means clear that such
finding would be warranted by the evidence given, and it is
certain that no conclusion more favorable to the plaintiff can

BAYLIS v. TRAVELLERS' INAURANCE COMPANY. 319
Statemer, of Faets..

be drawn from the proofs. I am therefore to determine
whether, as matter of law, such a death is within the scope of
the policy sued on. Upon this question my opinion is adverse
to the plaintiff. As I view the evidence the death was caused
by ' medical treatment for disease,' and, if so, it was excepted
by the terms of the policy.
"The contention in behalf of the plaintiff is that the opium
was not administered by the hand of a physician, and, moreover, was not the dose directed by the physician to be taken,
but was a dose taken by the insured upon his own judgment,
and that these facts take the case out of the exception in the
policy. But it must be conceded that the opium which caused
the death was taken by the insured with the object of allaying
the nervous excitement from which he was suffering. Cer.
tainly, then, this was disease. The advice of a physician had
been taken as to its cure. It is equally certain that there was
a treatment of this disease, for the remedy prescribed by the
physician was taken, although in excessive quantity, and the
opium taken was so taken because the physician had prescribed
it to remedy the disease. The opium was taken with no other
object than to effect the result which the physician had advised
should be attained by using opium. Under these circumstances
the fact that the patient deviated from the direction given by
the physician in the matter of amount, and, upon his own
judgment, took a larger dose than had been directed, does not
change the character of the act. The object of the insured in
taking the opium'he did was to cure or else to kill. The facts
repel the idea of an intention to kill and prove the intention to
cure. Death caused by such an act, done with such an intent,
is, in my opinion, a death caused wholly or in part by medical
treatment for disease, and, therefore, is not covered by the
policy. I am also of the opinion that the facts do not disclose
a case of bodily injury effected through ' external, violent, and
accidental means,' occasioning death, within the meaning of
the policy. I do not consider that violence can fairly be said
to be an ingredient in the act of taking a dose of medicine,
although the medicine be destructive in its action and death
the reult.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

"These considerations compel to a denial of the motion for
judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and a direction that judgment for the defendants be entered."
To which ruling and conclusion the plaintiff duly excepted.
-Y. John L. Hill for plaintiff in error.
-Mr. F. -. .Matherfor defendant in error.
MR. JusicE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the court.
He recited the facts as above stated, and continued:
If, after the plaintiff's case had been closed, the court had
directed a verdict for the defendant on the ground that the
evidence, with all inferences that the jury could justifiably
draw from. it, was insufficient to support a verdict for the
plaintiff, so that such a verdict, if returned, must be set aside,
it would have followed a practice sanctioned by repeated decisions of this court. Randall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,
109 U. S. 478, and cases there cited. And, in that event,
the plaintiff, having duly excepted to the ruling in a bill
of exceptions, setting out all the evidence, upon a writ of
error, would have been entitled to the judgment of this court,
whether, as a matter of law, the ruling against him was erroneous.
Or, if in the pre~ent case, a verdict having been taken for
the plaintiff by direction of the court, subject to its opinion
whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain it, the court had
subsequently granted a motion on behalf of the defendant for
a new trial, and set aside the verdict, on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence, 'it would have followed a common
practice, in respect to which error could not have been alleged,
or it might, with propriety, have reserved the question, what
judgment should be rendered, and in favor of what party, upon
an agreed statement of facts, and afterwards rendered judgment upon its conclusions of law. But, without a waiver of
the right of trial by jury, by consent of parties, the court errs
if it substitutes itself for the jury, and, passing upon the effect

BAYLIS v. TRAVELLERS' INSURANCE COMPANY. 321
Opinion of the Court.

of the evidence, finds the facts involved in the issue, and renders judgnent thereon.
This is what was done in the present case. It may be that
the conclusions of fact reached and stated by the court are correct, and, when properly ascertained, that they require such a
judgment as was rendered. That is a question not before us.
The plaintiff in error complains that he was entitled to have
the evidence submitted to the jury, and to the benefit of such
conclusions of fact as it might justifiably have drawn; a right
he demanded and did not waive; and that he has been deprived
of it, by the act of the court, in entering a judgment against
him on its own view of the evidence, without the intervention

of a jury.
In this particular, we think error has been well assigned.
The right of trial by jury in the courts bf the .United States
is expressly secured by the Seventh Article of Amendment to
the Constitution, and Congress has, by statute, provided for the
trial of issues of fact in civil cases by the court without the intervention of a jury, only when the parties waive their right to
a jury by a stipulation in writing. Rev. Stat. §§ 648, 649.
This constitutional right this court has always guarded with
jealousy. Elmore v. Gryme8, 1 Pet. 469; De Tolf v. Rabaud,
1 Pet. 476 ; Castle v. Bullard,23 How. 172 ; Hodgee v. Easton,
106 U. S. 408.
For error in this particular, the
Judgment is reversed, and the cause 'i remanded,with dire&
tione to grant a new triaZ.
