UNITED STATES v. STEEVER.
APPEAL

FROM THE COURT OF 0LAIMS.

Submitted January 9, 1885.-Declded March 16,1885.
A torpedo steam launch, attached to a division of a naval squadron, though
not proved to have had any books, is a ship, within the meaning of the
prize act of June 30; 1864, ch. 174, ยง 10, rules 4 and 5; and her commander
is entitled to one-tenth of prize money awarded to her, and cannot elect to
take instead a share proportioned to his rate of pay; but her other officers
and men are entitled to share in proportion to their rates of pay.
The distribution of prize money among-the subordinate officers and crew of a
ship "in proportion to their respective rates of pay in the service," under
the prize act of June 30, 1864, ch., 174, ยง 10, rule 5. is to be made according to their pay at the time of the capture, and not according to the pay of
grades to which they have since been promoted as of that time.
Under the act of August 8, 1882, ch. 480, referring the claims of the captors
of the ram Albemarle to the Court of Claims, each captor is entitled to
recover such a sum as, together with the sum formerly paid him by the
Secretary of the Navy under the prize decrees in the case of the Albemarle,
will equal his lawful share of the prize money in that case.

This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

JUSTIcE GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Claims in
favor of the appellee in a suit brought by him under the act of

MR.

August 8, 1882, ch. 480, to recover the amount necessary to
make up his lawful share of the prize money awarded for the
capture of the rebel ram Albemarle. Th6 facts of the case, as
appearing in the findings and judgment of the Court of Claims,

are as follows :
The rebel iron-clad ram Albemarle was captured and sunk at
Plymouth in the Roanoke River, in the State of North Carolina, on the night of October 27, 1864, by the United States
Picket Launch No. 1, an armed torpedo launch propelled by

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

steam, attached to a division of the North Atlantic blockading
squadron, and commanded by Lieutenant William B. Cushing,
of the United States Navy, and having on board six inferior
officers (of whom the petitioner, a third assistant engineer, was
one) and eight men. Lieutenant Cushing had been, by order
of the Secretary of the Navy, detached from the command of
the United States ship Monticello, and directed to report for
duty to Rear Admiral Porter, commanding that squadron;
and had been assigned by the admiral to the command of this
launch. It does not appear that the launch had any books.
The Albemarle was afterwards raised by the United States
forces, and appropriated to the use of the United States, and
was twice appraised by duly appointed boards of naval officers;
the first time, before she was so appropriated, at the sum of
$79,944, which was forthwith deposited by the Secretary of
the Navy with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at
Washington; and the second time, under the act of April 1,
1872, ch. 76, 17 Stat. 649, at the sum of $282,856.90, which,
less the sum already deposited, was likewise so deposited, pursuant to the act of January 8, 1873, ch. 18, 17 Stat. 405.
Upon successive prize proceedings in 1865 and 1873, in the
District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, the Albemarle was condemned as prize of var, and it was
adjudged and decreed that she was of superior force to the
launch, and that her appraised value, deducting costs, and
amounting to $273,135.09, be paid to the captors as follows:
One twentieth part to the admiral commanding the squadron at
the time of the capture, one hundredth part to the fleet captain, and one fiftieth part to the officer commanding the division to which the launch was attached, and the remainder distributed to the other persons doing duty on board the launch,
in proportion to their respective rates of pay in the service.
In all the prize proceedings, there was no appearance by or in
behalf of any of the captors except Cushing.
Before either of those decrees was made, three of the officers
of the lainch were promoted: Lieutenant Cushing, in February, 1865, to the rank of lieutenant commander; and Acting
Master's Mates William L. Howarth and Thomas S. Gay, in

UNITED STATES v. STEEVER.
Opinion of the Court.

March, 1865, the one to the grade of acting master, and the
other to the grade of acting ensign; and each promotion to
date from October 27, 1864.
The money so ordered to be distributed amdunted, after deducting the shares paid to the commander of the squadron, the.fleet captain and the division commander, to the sum of
$251,284.29, which was distributed by the officers of the Treasury Department among all the officers and crew of the
launch, or their legal representatives, in proportion to the
respective rates of.pay to which they were by law entitled on
the day of the capture, except that Cashing, Howarth and Gay
were, by order of the Secretary of the Navy, paid in proportion
to the rates of pay of the grades to which, after the capture,.
they had b~en promoted as aforesaid.
By the act of August 8, 1882, ch. 4.80, Congress referred the
claims of the captors of the Albemarle to the Court of Claims,
"with jurisdiction and authority to hear and determine the
same, and all defences thereto which are or may be open to the
United States, and to render judgment thereon, with the right
of appeal as in other cases;" and if the court should find that
any 'ofthe captors had not received their full and just share of
the prize money awarded for the capture of the Albemarle,
according to the proportions provided in the prize laws in forco,
at the time of the capture, and that they were entitled.'to claim
and recover the same, then to render judgment in favor of
them, or their legal representatives, for such sums a, added to
the amount already paid, should make up their lawful shares;
and provided that no suit should be brought under the provisions of this act after one year from the date of its passage;
and that any judgment rendered by the Court of Claims should
be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury out of any money in
the treasury applicable to the payment of prize to captors, and,
failing such money, out of any money in the treasury not
otherwise appropriated. 22 Stat. 738.
Within the time limited by this act, all the officers and men
of the launch, or their legal representatives, except Cushing,
Eowarth and Gay, brought suits under it in the Court of Claims,
which held that, according to the prize laws in force at the time

Opinion of the Court.

of the capture, Lieutenant Cushing was not entitled to prize
money in proportion to his rate of pay, but only as commander
of a single ship to one tenth of the prize money, and had therefore received $30,927.84 more than he was by law entitled to;
and that Howarth and Gay were entitled to prize money only
in proportion to their rate of pay as acting master's mates on
the da- of the capture, and not according to the pay of the
grades to which they had since been promoted, and had therefore received, Howarth $18,979.02 and Gay $11,801.52, more
than they were respectively entitled to; and that by the
amount of these three sums, or $61,708.38, the other twelve
captors had received less than they were entitled to; and gave
judgment for each of them, or their representatives, accordingly.

The present suit is brought under the act of August 8, 1882,
ch. 480, by one of the subordinate officers of the launch who
had not been promoted since the capture of the Albemarle.
The question whether he has heretofore received less than his

UNITED STATES v. STEEVER.
Opinion of the Court.

lawful share of prize money depends upon the question whether
larger shares than the prize act allowed have been awarded
and paid to Lieutenant Commander Cushing, and to Howarth
and Gay, who. at the time of the capture, were two of his acting master's mates.
The prize court" held that Cushing was entitled to share according to rate of pay with the other officers and meii on board
the launch. The Court of Claims held that he was entitled to
one tenth of the prize money as commander of a single ship.
The question which of thes6 views was correct depends upon
the rules laid down in section 10 of the prize act of June 30,
1864, ch. 174; 13 Stat. 306.
By those rules, all commanding officers have certain fractional parts of the prize money; and none of them have, or can
elect to take, a share proportioned to their pay. By rule 4,
there is to be paid "to the commander of a single ship one
tenth part of all the prize money awarded to the ship under
his command, if such ship at the time of the capture was under
the command of the commanding officer of a -fleet or squadron,
or a division, and three twentieths if his ship was acting independently of such superior officer.'" By rule 2, to the commanding officer of a division is to be paid one fiftieth part of
any prize money awarded to a vessel of his division, unless he
elects to receive instead the share due to him as commander of a
single ship making or assisting in.a capture, that is to say, one
tenth. And by rule 1, the commanding officer of a fleet or
squadron receives in all cases one twentieth of all prize money
awarded to vessels under his immediate command. .So, by rule
3, the fleet captain recevives one hundredth part of prize hioney
awarded to vessels of the fleet or squadron in which he is serving, with the single ex cption that when the capture is made
by the vessel on board of whtch .he is serving, he shares, in
proportion to his pay, with the other officers and men on
board. It is only 'after the foregoing deductions," that rule
5 directs that "the residue shall be distributed and proportioned
among all others doing duty on board (including the fleet
captain), and borne upon the books of the ship, in proportion to
their respective rates of pay in the service." 13 Stat. 309, 310.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court,

Those rules would seem to have been framed upon the
theory that in making general regulations for the distribution
of prize money it is more just and equitable, and more suitable
t6 the rank of commanding oflicers, to grant them a certain
fractional part, than to determine their shares by their rates of
pay, like subordinate officers and men; and upon the supposition that the fractional part awarded to the commander of a
single ship will usually be mdore than equivalent to a share proportfoned to his rate of pay.
But whatever may have been the reasons on which the
general rules of distribution laid down in the prize act were
founded, it is enough to say that those rules are fixed and
definite, governing all cases coming within their terms, and
aie the only guides of all courts and officers charged with the
duty of administering the prize act. The share of the commander of a ship is the same, whether he is leading in action
or lying disabled in his berth; and the share of the admiral
commanding the squadron is not increased if the capture is
made by his flagship, nor diminished if is made without his
participation or knowledge by another ship beionging t6 his
command. Lumley v. Sutton, 8 T. R. 224, 229; Pigot v.
TFite, 4 Doug. 302; S. C. 1 H. Bl. 265 note; Dr. Lushington,

law, because of the peculiar bravery or merit of the captors, or
any of them, in a particular case. The Atlanta,.3 Wall. 425,

We can have no doubt that the launch which took the
Albemarle was "a single ship," within the meaning of the
rules of distribution in the prize act of 1864.
In those rules,'the words "single ship" are used in contradistinction to the words "vessel or vessels," which include
more than one; and upon a view of the whole act, it is manifest that the word "ship,", in the few instances in which it occurs, has no restricted sense, implying three square-rigged
masts, or any masts at all, but is synonymous with the general

UNITED STATES v. STEEVER.
Opinion of the Court.

words "vessel of the Navy," or simply "vessel,"

as used

throughout the act, and comes within the definition of ยง
32, by which in the term "vessels of the Navy" are to be included for the purposes of this act, all armed vessels officered
and manned by the United States, and under the control of
the Department of the Navy. 13 Stat. 315. In the re-enactment of the fourth rule in Rev. Stat. ยง 4631, the words
"commander of a single vessel" are substituted for "com mander of a single ship."
Nor is it material that there was no affirmative proof that
the launch had any books. The keeping of books is not made
a condition of the right of any vessel to share in prize money.
The books of a ship are but the usual evidence of service on
board'; and neither the omission to keep books, nor the neglect
of the proper officers to enter names upon them, can be held to
cut off those lawfully assigned to duty on board, and actually
doing such duty, from participation in prize money awarded to
the ship. It is found as a fact that Lieutenant Cushing had
been detailed by the proper authorities from the ship which he
had previously commanded; -and as to the other officers and
men, the doing duty on board is sufficientprimafacie evidence,
at least, that they belonged to the launch, and were entitled to
share in the prize money. In TWemys v. Linzee, 1 Doug. 324,
cited for the United States, the captnin of marines, who was
denied an officer's share, was no part of the complement of the
ship. See .Mackenzie v. .Maylor,4 Doug. 3.
The launch being a single ship, within the meaning of the
prize act, her commander, as well as her other officers and her
crew, was entitled to prize money according to the fourth and
fifth rules of distribution therein prescribed.
The prize court therefore erred in awarding to her commander, instead of his one-tenth of the prize money, a share
proportioned to his rate of pay.
Another error occurred in the distribution of the prize money,
by order of the Secretary of the Navy, to Cushing, Hlowarth
and Gay, according to the rates of pay of the gradoe to which
they had be-en promoted since the capture. Although prize
money is, strictly speaking, a matter of bounty and not of

Opinion bf the Court,

right, and no one has any absolute title to it before adjudication, yet unless the government, acting through the proper
department, has clearly manifested an intention to revoke the
grant, or to alter the mode of distribution, it is to be awarded
and distributed according to the laws in force and the facts
existing at the time of the capture. The Siren, 13 Wall. 389;
The Esebe, 5 0. Rob. 173 ; Stevens v. Bagwell, 15 Ves. 139,
159; Pill v. Taylor, 11 East, 414, and 8 Taunt. 805; 11
Opinions of Attorneys General, 102. The direction in the
prize act to make distribution among inferior officers and men
"according to their respective rates of pay in the service"
naturally implies the rates of their pay at the time of the capture, by relation to which the subsequent distribution is made;
and not those rates as affected by promotions after the capture
and before decree or distribution, although such promotions, so
far as affects rank, and possibly ordinary pay, date from the
day of the capfure. To hold otherwise would be to leave the
shares of prize money, not only of the persons promoted, but
also of all others on board and entitled to share according to
rate of pay, subject to be varied in consequence of delay in
obtaining distribution.
For these reasons, this court concurs in the conclusions of the
Court of Claims as to the shares of prize money which the
officers and crew of the launch were entitled to receive under
the prize laws in force at the time of the capture. The inequitable operation of those laws, as applied to a capture by a
vessel having so small a number of officers and men as this
launch, by which the leader of the enterprise obtains le s prize
money than a paymaster or an engineer under his command,
is a matter for the consideration of Congress, and not of the
courts.
The report of the Committee on Naval Affairs of the House
of Representatives, accompanying the bill *hich was afterwards passed as the act of August 8, 1882, ch. 480, referred,
among other things, to the following documents: The decrees
of the prize court in the case of the Albemarle. The orders
of the Secretary of the Navy for the distribution of the prize
money. The opinion of Attorney General Reverdy Johnson,

5 Opinions of Attorneys General, 183. The opinion of Attorney Generaf Pierrepont, dated December 10, 1875, that this
launch was "a single ship," within the meaning of the prize
act; that her commander was entitled to his fractional part,
and could not share according to his pay, in the prize money of
the Albemarle; and that the rates of pay, according to which
others on board the launch were entitled to share in the prize
money, were the rates of pay at the time of the capture. 15
Opinions of Attorneys General, 63. A letter of the Secretary
of the Navy to the counsel of the captors, dated April 24, 1877,
stating that, as the prize money of the Albemarle had been
fully distributed, and as there was no other fund which he
could lawfully order to be paid to her captors, they must look
to Congress for the relief to which they seemed to be entitled.
Report No. 90, H. R. 1st Sess. 47th Congress.
It is evident, therefore, that the act of 1882 was passed with
a knowledge of the manner in which the prize money for the
capture of the Albemarle has been distributed by the Secretary
of the Navy under the decrees of the prize court; and the
reasonable inference is th'at Congress intended, without impeaching the validity of the distribution so made, or affecting
the right of any captor to hold the money already paid him,
but treating each as having received no more than a suitable
reward for his gallantry, to allow out of the Treasury, to those
of the captors who had received less than their lawful share
according to the rules of the prize act, enough to ipake up the
deficiency. The joint effect of the act of 1882 and the previous distribution is the same as if the prize money had been
distributed in conformity with those rules, and Congress had
afterwards granted to Cushing, Howarth and Gay, out of
money in the Treasury, sums in addition to their lawful shares
of prize money, as was done in the case of Captain Pprry for
captures on Lake Erie in the War of 1812. Act of April 18,
1814, cb. 70 ; 3 Stat. 130.
It is therefore unnecessary to express an opinion upon the
question argued by counsel, whether, under the act of 1864,

the jurisdiction of the prize court, upon the condemnation of
a prize taken by an armed vessel of the Navy, extended'to determining the separate shares of the officers and crew; or was
limited to adjudging what vessels were entitled to share, and
whether, by reason of their force as compared with that of
their prize, the whole or the half of the proceeds should go to
them-leaving the distribution among the officers and men
to be made by the Secretary of the Navy, according to the
records of the department.*

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

AR KANSAS.

Submitted December 22, 1884.-Decided March 15, 185.
No rule can be laid down in reference to amendments of equity pleadings that
will govern all cases. They.must depend upon the special circumstances
of each case. and in passing upon applications to amend, the ends of justice
must not be sacrificed to 'mere form or by too rigid an adherence to technical-rules of practice.
In a suit brought by the heirs and aaministrator of a vendor of land by title
bond, the bill alleged that the bond had been obtained by fraud, and, also,
that the land had not been fully paid for according to the contract of sale.
Its prayer was, among other things, that the bond be cancelled ; that an
account be taken of the rents and profits which the purchaser had enjoyed,
and of the amount paid on his purchase ;that the title of the complainants
be quieted ; and that they have such other relief as equity might require.
At the final hearing the complainants were permitted to amend the prayer
of the bill so as to ask, in the alternative, for a decree for the balance of
the purchase money and a lien on the land to secure the payment thereof:
Held, That no error was committed in allowing the amendment. It did
not make a new case, but only enabled the court to adapt its relief to that
