FUSSELI v. GREGG & others.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
Argued January 8, 9,1885.-Decided February 2,1885.
A Court in Equity has no jurisdiction over a suit based upon an equitable title
to real estate, unless the nature of the relief asked for is also equitable.

A court of the United States sitting in equity, cannot control the principal
surveyor of the Virginia military district in the discharge of his official

duties ; or take charge of the records of his office ; or declare their effect to
be other than what aplears on their face.
The plain meaning of the act' of March 23, 1804, 2 Stat. 274, to ascertain the
boundaries of the Virginia Military District in Ohio, is, that a failure within five years to make return to the Secretary of War of the survey of any

tract located within the Territory, made previous to the expiration of the
five years, should discharge the land from any claim founded on such location and survey and extinguish all rights acquired thereby.
The series of acts relating to this District, beginning with the act of March
23, 1804, and ending with thd act of July 7, 1838, 5 Stat. 262, as revived
and continued in force by later acts, are to be construed together, and as if
the third section of the act of March 23, 1804, had been repeated in every
act of the series.
The act of March 8, 1855, 10 Stat. 701, allowing persons who had made entries
before January 1, 1852, two years time to return their surveys, did not apply
to those who had made both entries and surveys before the latter date.
The land office referred to in ยง 2 of the act of May 27, 1880, 21 Stat. 142, relating to the Virginia Military District in Ohio is the General Land Office.
On the pleas and issues in this cause, the complainant has failed to make good
the case stated in the bill.

The facts which make the case are stated in the opinion of
the court.

MR.JusTicE WooDs delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a bill in equity, -filed November 20, 1879, to establish the title of the plaintiff to, and recover the possession of, a
certain traet of land in the County of Logan, in the State of
Ohio, and for an account of rents and profits. Filling the
many blanks left in the bill by resort to the evidence, the case
made thereby was substantially as follows':
On July 19, 1822, warrant No. 6,508 for 200 acres of land
was granted by the State of Virginia to the grandfather of the
plaintiff, Archibald Gordon, late of Cecil County, Maryland, in
consideration of his services as a private in the Virginia~line on

the Continental establishment in the War of the Revolution.
On January 21, 1823, he caused his warrant to be located by
entry No. 12,017 in the Virginia Military District in the State
of Ohio, and the entry to be duly recorded. On March 25,
1823, he caused the entry to be surveyed by Thomas J. McArthur, a deputy surveyor of said military district, and on
November 5, 1824, he had the survey recorded in the office of
the principal surveyor of the district. -Achibald Gordon died
intestate about the year 1829, leaving Archibald Gordon, Jr.,
late of Baltimore, Maryland, his only child and heir-at-law.
Archibald Gordon, Jr., died intestate about the year 1833 or
1834, leaving the plaintiff and her sister, Sarah Priscilla Gordon, his only children and heirs-at-law. The plaintiff, on October 31, 1854, intermarried with Joseph B. Fussell, who died
December 6, 1864, and the plaintiff's sister, Sarah Priscilla,
having intermarried with one William H. Kelly, died intestate
on May 12, 1853, leaving issue one daughter, her only child,
Mary Elizabeth Kelly. William H. Kelly died at a date not
mentioned, leaving his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, surviving
him, who died at the age of 9 years 6 months and 3 days
without issue, leaving the plaintiff her sole heir-at-law. The
plaintiff claimed that by direct inheritance from her father,
Archibald Gordon, Jr., and collateral inheritance from her
niece, Mary Elizabeth Kelly, she was seized of an equitable
estate in fee. in the lands covered by survey 12,017, and entitled tathe immediate possession thereof.
-It w~s further alleged that on October 4, 1851, Daniel Gregg,
one of'the defendants, made an -entry on the records of the
priticfpal surveyor of the district, No. 16,070, of 130 acres on
military warrant No. 442, and on December 20, 1851, he procured 'one hundred acres of his entry to be so surveyed as to
cover one hundred acres of land appropriated by the entry and
survey of Archibald Gordon, No. 12,017, and on November 2,
'18,'5, he caused the survey to be recorded, and on November
'20,.'1855, obtained a patent of that date for the lands described
in..this survey. The bill further averred that the entry, survey,
and patent of Gregg were all made and obtained in violation
of - the proviso of section 2 of the act of March 1, 1823, entitled

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Cour.

"An Act extending the time for locating Virginia military land
warrants, and.returning surveys thereon to the General Land
Office," 3 Stat. 772, and were, therefore, null and void, and
never appropriated any land or vested any title in Gregg -as
against the plaintiff, or those under whom she claimed.
It was further alleged that the defendant, -Eleazer P. Kendrick, being the principal surveyor of the Virginia Military
District, and in possession of the records of that office, did, subsequently to the entry and survey bf Gregg, without the knowledge or consent of- plaintiff, or of any person under whom she
claimed title, write in the margin of the record of Archibald
Gordon's entry the word "withdrawn," and in and across the
plat and record of the survey thereof the words "State line,"
and that Kendrick refused to give the plaintiff a duplicate of
said survey to enable her to obtain a patent for the land
described therein.
Daniel Gregg, Eleazer P. Kendrick, William Swissgood, Emily Swissgood, Francis Higgins, John W. Higgins, Angeline
Higgins, Matilda Higgins, James Eaton, W. G. Smithson and
Andrew Murdock were made defendants to the bill of complaint, the bill alleging that the defendants, except Gregg and
Kendrick, wrongfully kept the plaintiff out of possession of
the premises sued for, claiming title under Gregg. The prayer
of the bill was, that the validity of the entry and survey of
Gordon might be affirmed and established, and the entry, survey, and patent of Gregg declared void; that the words "withdrawn" and "State line" might be, adjudged to have been
written upon the record of the Gordon'entry and survey without authority; that the plaintiff might be .put in possession of
the premises sued for, and have an account of rents and profits,
and for general relief. Daniel Gregg,' Francis Higgins, John
W. Higgins, Angeline Higgins and Matilda Higgins, by plea,
and the other defendants, except Kendick, by answer, denied
the title of the plaintiff, and set up the limitation of twenty-one
years prescribed by the statute of Ohio, in bar of the relief
prayed by the bill. Kendrick made no defence. Upon final'
hearing upon the pleadings and evidence the Circuit Court dismissed the bill, and the plaintiff appealed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

We think that the averments of the bill do not entitle the
plaintiff to relief. Her case, as alleged, is, that she has an
equitable estate in fee in the premises in dispute, and that the
defendants, except Gregg and Kendrick are in possession without title; in other words, are naked trespassers. The theory of
her bill seems to be that, because she has an equitable title only,
and for that reason could not recover in an action at law, a
court of equity has jurisdiction of her case. But this is plainly
an error. Mr. Justice Bradley, in Young v. Porter,3 Woods"
342. To give a court of equity jurisdiction, the nature of the
relief asked must be equitable, even when the suit is based on
an equitable title. The plaintiff does not allege that the defendants, who are in possession of the premises, have the legal
title, or that they obtained possession under any person who
had it. Nor does she state any facts which connect them with
her equity. They being mere naked trespassers, in possession,
she prays that they may be turned out of, and she, who has
only an equitable title, may be put in possession. The relief
prayed for is such as a court of law is competent to grant, if
the plaintiff's title would justify it. But the plaintiff does not
seek by her bill to better her title. If all the relief asked for
were grahted, she would still have an equitable title only. The
case is, therefore, an ejectment bill brought on an equitable
title. In these respects it is similar to the bill in the case of
Galt v. Galloway, 4 Pet. 332." That was a bill in equity brought
by the heirs of James Galt for general and special relief against
Galloway, Baker, Patterson, and others, setting up title to one
thousand acres of land in the Virginia Military District in Ohio,
based upon an entry and survey in the name of -James Galt.
Baker and Patterson were in possession of six hundred acres of
the land, claiming title in the name of Gait. The court found
that Baker and Patterson had no title to the lands held by
them, and upon this state of case said: "These occupants can be
considered in no other light by the court than intruders; and
the remedy against them is at law and not in chancery, 'No
decree could be made against them, unless it be that they should
deliver possession of the premises; and to obtain this the action
of ejectment is the appropriate remedy." Page 339.

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Court.

This decision is in point, and shows the bill to be without
equity as to those of the. defendants who are in possession.
Their posses~ion is good against all the world except the true
owner. As the bill asserts no equity against them, they have
the right to stand on their possession until compelled to yield
to the true title, and to demand a trial by jury of the question
whether the plaintiff has the true title. The plaintiff cannot
deprive them of that right by neglecting to acquire the legal
title, and upon the ground of her equitable title, ask ,he aid of
a court of equity. She can turn'the defendants out of possession only upon the strength of the legal title, which she must
first acquirb. Having done this, a court of law is the proper
forum in which to bring her suit. Hipp v. Jabin,19 How.
271; -Parkerv. Finnipieogee _Jfanufaeturing Co., 2 Black,
545; Grand Chute v. Winegar, 15 Wall. 373; Le-wis v. Cock8,
23 Wall. 466; Killian v. binghaus, 110 U. S. 568.
As to the defendant Kendrick, .it is clear that a court of the
United States, sitting in equity, cannot control him in the discharge of his duties as principal surveyor, or take charge of the
records of his office, or declare their 'effect to be other than
what appears upon their face.
But we are also of opinion tbat, upon the issues raised by.
the pleas and answers, the plaintiff has failed to make good
the case which she has stated in her bill. The pleas and answers denied that the plaintiff had, as she averred; an equitable
estate in fee in the lands described in the bill.
We think that this defence is established by the facts; that
by reason of the failure of Archibald Gordon, or his legal representatives, to make return of the survey to the General Land
Office within the time prescribed by the several acts of Congress on that subject, the entry and survey became vacated,
annulled aid void, and the lands coverdd thereby became released from such entry and survey. So that the plaintiff, at
the time of bringing her syit, was without any interest or
estate in the lands described in her bill.
The lands in controversy are within what is known as the
Virginia Military District in the State of Ohio. The State of
Virginia claimed title to a large territory northwest as well as

southepst of the Ohio River, by virtue of a grant to the Colony.
of Virginia made by King James I. of Gieat Britain, on May
"3,
1609. The Virginia Military District is within the limits
of this grant. The State of Virginia, by an act of its legislature, passed in October, 1779, 10 -Hening's Stat. 159, provided
for bounty in lands to the offi -er and soldiers of Virginia in
the Revolutionary War, both hin what was designated as, the
Continental and State establigiament, and prescribed the quan*tity to which they were respectively entitled. Other acts of
the legislature provided for the issue of land warrants t6 those
entitled Co them, 10 Hening's 9tat. 50, and prescribed how they
might be lcated, 11 Hening's Stat. 353. On March 1, 1784,
the delegates'of the State of VirginU to the Congress of the
UnitedStates, being authorized thereto by an act of the legislature passed December 20, 1783, 11 Hening'i Stat. F,26, conveyed to the United States all the lands whiclh the State of
Virginia owned or claimed northwest of the Ohio River. See
deed of cession, 11 Hening's Stat. 571.
The cession was made subject to certain reservations and conditions, among which was the following:. "That in case -the
quantity.of good land on the southeast side of the Ohio, upon the
waters of the Cumberland River, and between the Green River
and Tennessee, which has been reserved bylaw for the Virginia
troops on the Continental establishment, should, from the
North Carolina lifie bearing in further upon. the Cumberland
lands than was expected, prove insufficient for their legal
bounties, the deficiency should be made up to the said troops
in good lands to be laid off between the rivers Scioto and Little
Mjiail on the northwest side.of the River Ohio, in such proportions -as have been engaged to them. by the laws of Virginia."
This. court, in the case of Jackon v. Clark, 1 Pet. 628, speaking': dy Chief Justice Marshall, construed this reservation to be
0 not. a reservation of the whole tract of country lying be-

tween the fivers Scioto and Little Miami. IXis a reservation of
only so.much of it as may be necessary to makeup the deflqincy'
'ofgood lanis in the country set apart for the officers and soldiers
,of the'firginia line on the Continental establishment southeast
of the'Ohio," and declared that the residue of the lands waยง

Opinion of the Court.

ceded as a common property for -the use and benefit of the
members of the Confederation; and this trust was to be executed by a faithful and bona fide disposition of the land for
this purpose.
As an inference from these views, the court further held that
it was within the power of Congress to prescribe the time
within which the lands to be appropriated by those holding
the bounty warrants should be separated from the general mass,
so as to enable the government to apply the residue, which it
was then supposed would be considerable, to the other purposes
of the trust, and if the time within which the warrants might
be located was extended by Congress, it had the right to
annex conditions to the extension.
Congress, in the exercise of these powers, w'ich, in the case
just cited, it was subsequently decided it possessed, on March
23, 1804, passed an act entitled " n Act to ascertain the
boundary of the lands reserved by the State of Virginia, northwest of the river Ohio, for the satisfaction of her officers and
soldiers on Continental establishment, and to limit the period
for locating the said lands." 2 Stat. 274. Section 1 of this act
defined the boundary of the Virginia Military District in Ohio.
-Section 2 provided:
"That all the officers and soldiers, or their legal representatives,'who are entitled to bounty lands within the above-mentioned reserved territory, shall complete their locations within
three years after the passing of this act, and every such officer
and soldier, or his legal representative, whose bounty land has
or shall have been located within that part of the said territory
to which the Indian title has been extinguished, shall make return of his or their surveys to the Secretary of the Department
of War within five years after the passing of this act, and shall
also exhibit and file with the said Secietary, apd within the
same time, the original warrant or warrants under which he
claims, or a certified copy thereof, under the seal of the office
where the said warrants are legally kept; which warrant, or
certified copy thereof, shall be sufficient evidence that the grantee
therein named, or-the person under whom such grantee claims,
was originally entitled to such bounty land; and every person

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

entitled to said lands and thus applying, shall thereupon be entitled to receive a patent in the manner prescribed by law."
The third and last section provided: "That such part of the
above-mentioned reserved territory as shall not have been located, and those tracts of land within that part of the said
terrritory to which the Indian title has been extinguished, the
surveys whereof shall not have been returned to the Secretary
of War within the time and times prescribed by this act, shall
thenceforth be released from any claim or claims for such
bounty lands."
*The plain meaning of the act is that a failure within five
years after its passage to make return to the Secretary of War
of the survey of any tfact of land located within said territory,
made previous -tothe expiration of said five years, should discharge the land fruni any claim foundea on such location and
survey, and extinguish all right, title, and estate previously acquired thereby; and that. all lands within said district not
located within the same period, should be released and
discharged from the right of any person to locate a military warrant thereon. The survey of the entry of Archibald Gordon has, tb this day, never been returned to
the Secretary of War or, as provided by subsequent acts, to
the General Land Office of the United States. His right to
the.-anis covered by his ntry and survey was therefore cut
qff by the act of March 23, 1804, unless it has been saved by
subsequent legislation of Congress. Counsel for plaintiff not
denying that such was the effect of the act of March 23, 1804,
insists that the period limited for returning the survey has been,
from time to time, so prolonged that the entry and survey of
Gordon ave now valid and subsisting, and yest in the plaintiff,
as the sole heir of Gordon, an equitable estate in the lands
covered 15y the survey.
This legislation will now be noticed. The act which first followed the law of. 1804 was that approved March 2, 1807, 2
Stat.. 424. It allowed the officers and soldiers who -were entitled to bounty lands in the Virginia Military District a'further time of three years from March 23, 1807, to complete
their locations, Ehd five years froqi. the same date to return

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Court.

their surveys and warrants to the office of the Secretary of
War. The act also contained the following proviso: "that no
locations, as aforesaid, within the above mentioned tract, shall,
after the passing of this act, be made on tracts of land for which
patents had previously been issued, or which had been previously surveyed, and any patent which may nevertheless 1be
obtained for land located contrary to the provisions of this
section, .shall be considered as null and void."
The period of limitation prescribed-by the act of March 23,
1801, for making locations and returning surveys was subsequently, from time to time, extended by successive acts of Congress. Act of November 3, 1814, 3 Stat. 143 ; Act of February 22, 1815, 3 Stat. 212; Act of April 11, 1818, 3 Stat. 423;
Act of February 9, 1821, 3 Stat. 612; Act of March 1, 1823,
3 Stat. 772; Act of May 20, 1826, 4 Stat. 189. These acts, except that of February 22, 1815, 3 Stat. 212, all contained and
repeated the proviso above recited of the act 6f March 2,
1807.

Congress having established by the act of April 25, 1812, 2
Stat. 716, a General Land Office, the act of November 3, 1814,
provided for the return of the surveys and warrants to that
office instead of to the Secretary of War, and in this respect
was followed by the subsequent statutes, except the act of February 22, 1815, which contained no direction in respect to the
return of surveys and warrants.
The act of May 20, 1826, extended the time for making lo.cations to June 1, 1829, for making surveys to June 1, 1832,
and for ret rning surveys to June 1, 1833. After the expiration of the term limited by this act an interval of five years
occurred, during which no authority existed for making locations, surveys, or returns of surveys.
The act of July 7, 1838, 5 Stat262, extended the time for
making locations and surveys, and the return of surveys to the
General Land Office, to August 10, 1840, and provided as follows: "That all entries and surveys which may have heretofore been made within the said reservation in satisfaction of
any such warrants on lands not previously entered or surveyed,
or on lands not prohibited from entry and survey, shall be held

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

to be good and valid, any omission heretofore to extend the
time for making of such entries and surveys to the contrary
notwithstanding." It also contained the proviso of the act of
March 2, 1807, above recited.
By an act approved August 19, 1841, 5 Stat. 449, the act of
July 7, 1838, was "revived and continued in force" until January 1, 1844, and by an act approved July 29, 1846, 9 Stat.
41, the act of August 19, 1841, was "revived and continued in
force" until the first day of January, 1848. On July 5, 1848,
9 Stat. 244, a like act was passed, by which the act of August
19, 1841, was "revived and continued in force until January 1,
1850." And by ain act passed Februay 20, 1850, 9 Stat. 421,
the same act of July 5, 1848, was revived and continued in
force until January 1, 1852.
The effect of the series of acts, beginning with the act approved August 19, 1841, and ending with the act of February
20, 1850, was to continue in force the act of July 7, 1838, till
January 1, 1852. The whole series, beginning- with the act
of March 23, 1804, and ending with the act of July 7, 1838, as
revived and continued in force by the later acts just referred
to, relates to the same subject and is to be construed together.
The United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556; Rex v. loxdale,
1 Burr. 445, 447. It appears, even from a cursory reading, that
ยง 3 of th6 act of March 23, 1804, was not repealed or modified, either directly or indirectly, by any of the subsequent acts
above mentioned. There was no direct repeal of the section.
Neither was there any repeal by implication. 2icCool v.Smith,
1 Black, 459; United State8 v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88; flender8o's
Tobacco, Ib.652; Afurdock v. 2femhks, 20 Wall. 590; Red
Rock v. Hienry, 106 U. S. 596. It was allowed to remain unaltered on the statute book; the effect of the subsequent legislation being only to suspend its operation until the first day of
January, 1852. The interpretation must, therefore, be the
same as if the third section of the act of March 23, 1804, had
been repeated in every subsequent statute of the series. As neither Archibald Gordon, nor any of his heirs or representatives,
ever made a return of the survey of the land in dispute, either
to the Secretary of War, or the Commissioner of the General

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Court.

Land Office, either before or after the first day of January,
1852, the third section of the act of March 23, 1804, cuts up by
the ro ts all the right and title derived from the location and
survey of Archibald Gordon.
Under the acts of Congress, Gordon, by his entry and survey,
acquired title depending on his perfprmance of certain prescribed conditions. His failure to perform the conditions
stripped him of all interest or estate in the lands covered by
his entry and survey.
That such is the effect of the third section of the act of March
23, 1804, is made manifest by the proviso above quoted of the
act of July 7,1838, which declared all entries and surveys
theretofore made to be good and valid,'notwithstanding any
omission by Congress. to extend the time for making such
entries and surveys. This is equivalent to a declaration by
Congress that ยง 3 of the act of 1804 was .still in force, and
legislation was necessary to relievp from its operation entries
and surveys not made within the time limited by that or the
subsequent enactments.
Since the act of February 20, 1850, Congress has passed two
acts, on both of which the plaintiff relies as making good her
title. The first -f these is the act of March 3, 1855, 10 Stat.
701, entitled "A n act allowing the further time of two years
to those holding land by entries in the Virginia Military District in Ohio which were, made prior to the first of January,
1852, to have the same surveyed -and patented." This act
provided "that the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line of
Continental establishment, their heirs or assigns, entitled to
bounty lands which have, prior to the first day of January,
1852, been entered within the tract reserved by Virginia
between the Little Miami and Scioto rivers, for 'satisfying the
legal bounties to her officers and soldiers upon Continental
establishment, should be allowed the further time of two years
from and after the passage of this act to make and return their
surveys and warrants, or certified copies of warrants, to the
General Land Office."
This ct is by its terms confined to lands entered and not
surveyed prior to January 1, 1852. The policy of the act is
VOL. cx

Opinion of the Court.

clear. The acts passed prior to the act of, July 7, 1838, fixed
one period for locating entries and a longer time ,for making
and returning surveys, plainly because the surveys could not
be made until the entries were made. But the act of July 7,
1838, as revived and continued in force by subsequent statutes,
fixed the first day of January, 1852, as the limit allowed both
for making entries and making and returning surveys. It
therefore doubtless happened that laggard warrant holders
procrastinated the making of their entries until it was too late
to make and return their surveys before the fi~st of January,
1852. Therefore the act of March 3, 1855, was passed allowing the holders of warrants, who had made their entries before
January 1, 1852, two years further time after the passage of
the act to make and return their surveys. Those who before
January 1, 1852, had made both their entries and surveys were
not within the words or spirit of the act.
The next act on which the plaintiff relies ig-ohe act of May
27, 1880, 21 Stat. 142. This act is entitled "An Act to construe
and define 'An Act to cede to the State of Ohio the unsold
lands in the Virgiia Military District in said State' approved
February 18, 1871, and for other purposes." The act which
was to be construed and defined provided "that lands remaining unsurveyed and unsold in the Virginia Military District in
the State of Ohio, be, and the same are hereby, ceded to the
State of Ohio," and saved to any bonaXde settler not exceeding
one hundred and sixty acres by him occupied by his pre-empting
the same in such manner as the State of Ohio might direct.
16 Stat. 416.
The plaintiff relies on the first three- sections of the act of
May 27, 1880. The first section declares that the true intent
and meaning of the act of February 18, 1871, just mentioned,
was to cede to the State of Ohio only such lands as were unappropriated and not included in any entry or survey within
said district founded on military warrants upon Continental..
establishment.
The second section is as follows: "That all legal surveys returned to the land office on or before March third, eighteen
hundred and fifty se:en, on entries made on or before January

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Court.

first, eighteen hundred and fifty-two, and founded on unsatisfied
Virginia military Continental warrants, are hereby declared
valid."
The third section provided that the officers and soldiers of
the Virginia line on Continental establishment, their heirs or
assigns, "entitled to bounty lands which have, on or before
January first, eighteen hundred and fifty-two, been entered"
in the Virginia Military District in Ohio, should be allowed
three years after the passage of the act to make and return
their surveys for record to the office of the principal surveyor
of said district, and might file their plats, and certificates, warrants, or certified copies of warrants, at the General Land
Office, and receive patents for the same.
The provisions of the third section are based on the same
policy, and are similar to those of the act of March 3, 1855,
ubi eupra, and must receive the same construction, namely,
that three years further time was allowed for the return of the
surveys of the land which had been entered but not surveyed
before January 1, 1852. The section does not, therefore, help
the plaintiff's title.
But the plaintiff relies confidently on the second section,
and her contention is, that the "land office" referred to in this
section is the same as the "office of the principal surveyor of
said," the Virginia military, "district" mentioned in the third
section of the act, and that, as on November 25, 1824, Archibald Gordon had recorded his survey in the latter office, kept
at Chilicothe, Ohio, the section above quoted makes the survey
valid.
In construing the second section of the act of 1880, the rule
already referred to must be applied, namely, that all acts in
relation to the same subject are to be construed together as if
one act. The act of 1880 is part of the system of legislation
relatiiig to the Virginia Military District in the State of Ohio,
beginning with the act of March 23, 1804, and continued in
the fourteen other acts heretofore referred to. The acts of
March 23, 1$04, and of March 2, 1807, passed before the
establishment of the General Land Office, required surveys to
be returned to the Secretary of War. All the subsequent acts,

564

except thd act of February 22, 1815, which omitted any direction" for the return of surveys, fourteen in number, either
directly or by reference to other acts, required surveys to be
returned to the General Land Office. When, therefore, the
second section of the act of May 27, 1880, provides that all
legal surveys returned to the "land office" before March 3,
1857, shall be valid, it is not open to question that the land
6ffice referred to is the General Land Office. In all the legislation on the subject, found in thirteen acts of Congress, extending over a period of sixty-eight years, no other land office
had-been mentioned. The theory that the words" land office,"
in the act of May 27, 1880, meant the office of the principal
surveyor of the District of Chilicothe, which, in all the previous
legislation had never. been named or alluded to, is without any
support in any rule of construction, and is inconsistent with
the system -for the disposition of the lands adopted and maintained by Congress for more than three-quarters of a century.
That system, as we have seen, required the surveys and warrants to be returned to the city of Washington, at first to the
Secretary of War, and afterwards to the General Land Office.
It required that patents should be issued by the President upon
so returned, and no patent could issue on any survey
surveys
'not so returned.
It cannot be conceived that Congress, by the
omission of the word "general" before the words "laud
office," intended to reverse this policy which it had persistently
adhered to through fifteen different statutes and for nearly
three generations, and' thus to unsettle the titles to land in a
large and densely peopled territory.
Nor can we impute to Congress the incongruity of using the
words "land office," and the words "the office of the principal
surveyor of said district," in contiguous sections of the same
act, to mean the same thing. But all doubt, if any existed,
of the true meaning of the words "land office" in the section
under consideration is removed by the fact that the section is
plainly in substance and effect a re-enactment of the act of
March 3, 1855, which provided in terfns for the return of surveys to the General Land Office.
The plaintiff further insists that the first and second see-

FUSSELL v. GREGG.
Opinion of the Court.

tions of the act of May 27, 1880, repeal, by implication, the
third section of the act of March 23, 1804. There is no ground
for such a contention. It is most unreasonable to suppose that
Congress intended, by doubtful inference, to repeal the salu,tary provision of section 4 of the act of 1804, which, in numerous enactments, it had cautiously preserved for a period of,
seventy-six years, and on which the titles to a, vast domain
rested.
The object of the first and second sections of the act of May
27, 1880, was not to confer new rights, -but to preserve rights
already vested, from impairment by any construction which
might be placed on the act of February 18, 1871, by which the
unsurveyed and unsold lands in-the Virginia 31ilitary District
were ceded to the State of Ohio.
But it is enough to say that there is no inconsistency between the two enactments, one of which is said to repeal the
other. There can, therefore, be no repeal by implication.
It follows that the plaintiff can derive 'no aid from any act
of Congress passed since the first day of January, 1852. Oi
that day all interest and estate of the heirs of Archibald Gordon
in the lands covered by his entry recorded on January 1, 1823,
and his survey recorded oni November 6, 1824, ceased and determined. The plaintiff, therefore, has failed to make good
her averment that she has an equitable estate in fee simple to
the premises in controversy. She has, therefore, shown no
right to the relief prayed by her bill.
It is immaterial whether the Tpatent'of Gregg, under which
the defendants claim, was valid or void. The plaintiff, having
no title, can have no relief against them. The defendants, being in possession, are entitled to retain possession until ousted
by one who has the title. The decree of the Circuit Court, by
which th6 bill was dismissed, was, therefore, right, and is

brought for, a part of the lands covered by the same entry and
survey, and prayed for the same relief. The same defences were
pleaded. It follows, from what has been said in the above case,
that this suit is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity,
and that the plaintiff has no right whatever to the lands to which
she seeks to establish title, and of which she prays to be put in
possession. The decree of the Circuit Court by which the bill
was dismissed was, therefore, right.

ST. LOUIS v. MYERS.
IN ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
Submitted November 24, 1884.-Decided March 2. 185.

The act of March 6, 1820, 3 Stat. 545, admitting Missouri into the Union left
the rights of riparian ovners on the Mississippi River to be settled according to the principles of State law.
The act of June 12, 1866, ยง 9, 14 Stat. 63, relinquishing to the city of St. Louis
the rights of the United States in wharves and thoroughfares, did not authorize the city to impair the rights of other riparian proprietors by extending streets into the river.
This case presents no Federal question to give jurisdiction to the court, and is
distinguished from Railway Co. v. Renwick, 102 U. S. 180.

This was a motion to dismiss for want of a Federal question
