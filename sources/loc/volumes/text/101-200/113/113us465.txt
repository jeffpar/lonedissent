ST. LOUIS, IRON MOUNTAIN & SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. BERRY & Another, Railroad
Commissioners.
IN

ERROR TO THE SL"PREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.
Submitted . anuary 7, 1885.-Decided March 2,1885.

A consolidation of two railway companies by an agreement which provides that
all the property of each company shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to the consolidated company (naming it) "as such new corporation
without further act or deed," creates a new corporation, with an existence
dating from the time when the consolidation took effect, and is subject
to constitutional provisions respecting taxation in force in the State at that
time.
One section in the charter of a railway company authorized it to consolidate
with other companies. Another section provided that the "capital stock
and dividends of said company shall be forever exempt from taxation ; the
road, fixtures and appurtenances shall be exempt from taxation until it
pays an interest of not less than ten per cent per annum." Held, That a
new company. created by the exercise of the power to consolidate, took the
property and franchises of the old company subject to the organic law as to
taxation at the time of the consolidation.

This was a writ of error to review the action of the Supreme
Court of Arkansas in refusing to restrain officers of that State
from levying a tax on property of the plaintiff in error. The
grounds on which exemption from taxation was claimed, and
on which a Federal question was raised, are stated in the opinion of the court.

Ohio, in thie State of Missouri, by way of Little Rock, to the
Texas boundary line, near Fulton, in Arkansas, with one or
more branches to the western boundary line of that State, with
the view of entering the northeastern and the northwestern
portions of Texas, and there connecting with projected railroads in that State, from the Bay of Galveston, running up the
valleys of the Brazos and Trinity Rivers, and with power to
construct branches to any other point or points within the
State of Arkansas. The capital stock of the company was
fixed at $1,500,000, to be increased from time to time to any
sum not exceeding the entire amount expended on account of
said road.
The abt contained the following sections:
"SEac. 10. Said corporation shall have power to unite their
road with the southern end of the Missouri road, at some suitable point on the line which divides these two States, and its
southern end with any road coming in from Texas, at such
point on the boundary line which divides that State and
Arkansas that may be deemed most eligible, and to make any
contract r"agreement with any other railroad company in
reference to their business that may best insure the early construction of said road and its successful management, and also
to make joint stock with any other railroad company in this or
any other State, and to form one board of diregtors for the
management of their affairs. If it should be found necessary
to facilitate the early construction of their said road, the contract or agreement of the respective boards shall form a part
of their resliective charters, whenever the same may be entered
into and recorded with their charters.
"S~c. 11. That the capital stock and dividends of said compauy shall be forever exempt from taxation; the road, fixtures,
and appurtenances shall be exempt from taxation until after it
pays an interest of not less than ten per cent. per annum.

favorably construed for all the purposes therein expressed, and
declared in all courts and places whatsoever, and shall be in
force from and after its passage: Provided, That all the

to 'The Mississippi Valley Railroad Company,' and not
restricting or inconsistent with this act, are hereby extended to
and shall form a part of this incorporation as fully as if the
same was inserted herein."
The reference to the charter of the Mississippi Valley Railroad Company need not be further considered, as it does not
seem to be material in the present controversy. Railway Co.
v. Lofti, 98 U. S. 559.
At the time of the passing of the act incorporating the
Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company the Constitution of Arkansas contained no restriction upon the power of the legislature
to grant such an exemption from taxation as the charter contains. But the Constitution of the State, which took effect
April 1, 1868, and was in force until October, 1874, contained
the following provisions:
"The General Assembly shall pass no special ai-t 6onferring
corporate powers. Corporations may be formed under general
laws, but a4l such laws may from time to time be altered or
repealed." Article 5, section 48.
"The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen or
class of citizens privileges or immunities which upon the same
terms shall not equally belong to all citizens." Article 1,
section 18.,
"The property of corporatiotis now existing or hereafter
created shall forever be subject to taxation the same as property of individuals." Article 5, section 48.
On July 23, 1868, an act was passed by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas "to provide for a general system
of railroad incorporation," in which is the following:
"Sw. 43. Any railroad compainy now chartered under existing laws, or which may hereafter become incorporated under
this law, shall have power and authority to purchase and hold
any connecting railroad and operate the same, or to consolidate
their companies and mgke one company, under the name of"
one or both or any other name'; but when such purchase is
made or consolidation is effected the said company shall have
and be entitled to all the -benefits, rights, franchises, lands and

tenemen.ts, and property of every description, belonging to
said road or roads so sold or consolidated, and shall be liable
to all the pains and penalties imposed by their respective
charters."
On January 1, 1874, the main line of the Cairo and Fulton
Railroad Company was completed and was in actual operation;
but the branches authorized by the charter were not completed
until after the consolidation between that company and the St.
Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company, a corporation of
Missouri, which took etlect on May 4, 1874, and resulted in
the formation of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern
,Railway Company, the complainant and plaintiff in error in
this suit.

This consolidation was effected by means of certain proceedings and an agreement between the parties, the parts of which,
pertinent to the present controversy, are as 'follows:
The board of directors of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad
Company, on May 4, i874, adopted these resolutions, viz.:
"1?ewoied.,That this company will enter into an agreement
with the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company for
uniting and consolidating this company with the said St. Louis
and Iron Mountain Railroad Company, and for making joint
stock of the two companies and forming one board of directors
for the management of the affairs of said companies, on the
basis jointly recommended by the committees on consolidation,
and embraced in the agreement executed by the said St. Louis
and Iron Mountain Company, and now here submitted for execution on the part of this company.
Re8oked further, That the president of this company be,
and he is hereby, authorized and directed to execute the agreement submitted, to be, however, subject to the approval and
confirmation of the stockholders of this company, called to be
holden on Monday, the 4th day of May inst., or any other day
thereafter, and when approved that the president cause the
same to be carried into effect, and call in the certificates of
stock in this company outstanding, and exchange them for
stock in the new company according to the terms of the
agreement."

ST. LOUIS, &c., RAILWAY CO. v. BERRY.

469

Opinion of the Court.
The agreement of consolidation referred to was approved and
adopted by the stockholders of the company on the same day.
It purports to be an agreement entered into April 13, 1874, between the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad'Company, a
corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the
laws of the State of Missouri, party of the first part, and the
Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, a corporation organized
and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of
Arkansas, party of the second part. It recites that"Whereas the party of the firs$ part owns and operates a
line of railroad extending from the city of St. Louis southward
to the boundary line between the States of Missouri and
Arkansas, where it intersects the railroad of the party of the
second part; it also owns and operates a line of railroad running from Bismarck to Belmont, and also owns and operates a
line of railroad running from Poplar Bluff eastward to the
Mississippi River, at a point opposite the mouth of the Ohio
River, and a branch railroad from Mineral Point to Potosi, all
in the State of Missouri. And the party of the second part
owns and operates a line of railroad extending from the
boundary line between the States of Missouri and Arkansas,
where it forms a junctidn with the line of railroad of the party
of the first part, through the cities of Little Rock and Fulton,
to the town of Texarkana, upon the boundary line between
the States of Arkansas and Texas, and the said railroads form
continuous and connecting lines of railroad with each other so
connected as to admit the passage of burden and passenger
cars over each continuously without change, break, or interruption.
"And whereas the said parties are authorized by the laws of
the several States aforesaid to consolidate their capital stock,
franchises and property together, and become one 'corporation ,
and it is believed that such consolidation will be beneficial
to the stockholders of each of said corporations and to the
public,
" Now, therefore, this agreement witnesseth that the said
parties of the first and second parts hereto, by their respective
boards of directors, duly convened, have agreed, and do hereby

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
.Opinion of the Court.

agree, to iherge and consolidate the capital stock, franchises,
and property of the said two corporations, so that the same shall
become the -capital stock, franchiseg, and property of one corporation; and for that purpose do hereby make and prescribe
the following terms and conditions of such merger and consolidation, and the mode of carrying the same into effect."
It then provides that the name of the new corporation shall
be "St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company;"
prescribes the number of the directors and officers, and the
names of those who "shall be the first directors of the new
corporation;" fixes the amount of the capital stock of the
corporation at $26,500,000, divided into shares of $100 each, and
provides that-"Every stockholder in each of the corporations, parties
hereto of the first and second parts, shall receive, in place of
stock held by him in said corporations, stock in the new corporation as follows, to wit, for each share of stock held in the
St. 'Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company, he shall receive one share of stock in the 'St. Louis, Iron Mountain and
Southern Railway Company;' and for each share of stock
held in the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, he shall receive sixty-hundredths of one share in the St. Louis, Iron
Mountain and Southern Railway Company."
The sixth article of the agreement is as follows:
"SEc. 1. Upon the making and perfecting of this agreement
and act of consolidation, and upon the adoption and ratification
thereof by two-thirds of the votes of all the stockholders of the
respective corporations parties hereto, and upon the filing of
the same, or a copy thereof, in the manner prescribed by law,
the parties hereto shall be deemed and taken to be one corporation by the name provided in this agreement, and shall
possess within the several States into and through which its
railroad, or any part thereof, or its branches or leased lines,
may run, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of each of the
said corporations so consolidated.
"SEc. 2. Upon the consummation of said act of consolidation, as provided by law, all and singular the rights, privileges,
and franchises of each of said corporations parties hereto, and

Opinion of the Court

all other property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due
on whatever account, as well stock subscriptions as all other
things in action belonging to each and every of said corporations, parties hereto, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in the 'St. Louis, Iron Mountain and
Southern Railway Company,' as such new corporation, without
further act or deed, and all property, all rights of way, and all
and every other.interest shall be as effectually the property of
this new corporation, without further conveyance or assurance,
as they were of the former corporations -parties hereto; and all
rights, of creditors, and all liens upon the property created
by either of the said corporations, shall be preserved unimpaired,
notwithstanding said merger, and consolidation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, and duties, of either of said corporations
parties hereto, shall thenceforth attach to the said new corporation and be enforced against it to the same extent and in
the same manner as if said debts, liabilities,'obligations, and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
"And the board of directors of said company shall have full
power and authority to borrow such sums of money, and in
such form, as they may deem proper, to pay off the present
debts an&liabilities so assumed by the corporation hereby created, and to meet other exigencies of the company, and tp secure
the payment thereof by a mortgage or mortgages on the
property and franchise of said company or any part thereof.
"The by-laws whichmay be adopted by concurrent resolution
of stockholders' meetings of said companies, parties hereto,
shall be the by-laws of said consolidated company, subject to
repeal or amendment as therein or by law provided."
The consolidated company, organized under this agreement,
claims that it is entitled, under the provisions of the charter of
the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, to the exemption
from taxation contained in the eleventh section of that act.
It accordingly filed its bill in equity in the Chancery Court of
Pulaski County to restrain the defendants, the defendants in
error, who were the railroad commissioners of the State, from
proceeding to assess for taxation, under the provisions of "An
Act to revise and amend the revenue laws of Arkansas," alm

Opinion of the Court.

proved March 31, 1383, the railroad of the company in the
State of Arkansas, leging that " its road wad, completed on
the 5th day of Dd -ember, 18-73; that it does not now, and
never had, paid an interest of ten per cent. per annum, nor
has any dividend ever been realized or declared on its capital
stock."
A decree dismissing the bill was rendered on final hearing
in the Chancery Court, on two grounds-that the complainant
company was not entitled to the benefit of the exemption con,tained in the eleventh section of the charter of the Cairo and
Fulton Railroad Company, and that, if it were otherwise, the
exemption would not apply, for the reason that the court
found upon the testimony that the earnings of the road in
Arkansas had been, and were for the year 1882, more than ten
per cent. on the cost of its construction and equipment. On
appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas, this decree was
affirmed on the single ground that the complainant company
was not entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation'
claimed by it. In reference to the other question the court
said: "What we have already said renders it unnecessary to
go into this question. In the very nature of things it is impossible to do more than guess at it. It appears by the plaintiff's
own proofs that the officers cannot tell, save by an approximation, what the actual earnings of this part of the road
are." To reverse this decree the present writ of error is prosecuted.
The main point urged in argument in support of the claim
of the plaintiff in error to the exemption from taxation is, that
the consolidation of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company
with the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company was
the exercise of a right, on the part of the former, plainly and
expressly conferred by the tenth section of its charter, and not
in anywise inconsistent with the continued force of the exemption contained in the eleventh section, which referred as
well to the company when it had become a constituent of a
consolidated company under the previous section, as to the
same company in its original form and organization; so that
the terms of the exemption, which, it is not denied, is a valid

Opinion of the Court.

contract protected against subsequent legislation by the Constitution of, the United States, apply to the plaintiff in error, as
a party directly embraced within its words and meaning.
To this view several objections are suggested.
It is said, in the first place, thatfthe authority "to make joint
stock with any other railroad company in this or any other
State, and to form one board of directors for the management
of their. affairs," notwithstanding the punctuation which
separates the sentence from the following words-" If it should
be found necessary to facilitate the early construction of their
said road "-yet, nevertheless, is necessarily connected with
them in sense, and must be limited by them; that a consolidation, not effected until after the complete construction of the
road, is not embraced within the authority conferred; and
that, consequently, the consolidation, as made in 1874, must be
referred to the forty-third section of the general act of 1868,
and subject, therefore, to the restrictions of the State Constitution then in force, forbidding the exemption of corporate
property from taxation.
But to this it is replied that the forty-third section of the act
of 1868 does not authorize a consolidation of domestic with
foreign corporations, and applies to the former alone; and that,
consequently, the consolidation now the subject of discussion,
if it cannot be referred to the tenth section of the charter of the
Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, must fail altogether.
It is next objected, however, that, admitting the consolidation to have been effected, as claimed by the plaintiff in error,
under the provisions of that charter, the language of the exemption in the eleventh section cannot be applied to the consolidated company. The words of that section exempt forever
from taxation the capital stobk and dividends "of said company," which would seem to imply the continued separate
existence of the company as originally organized, and not
properly to refer to a capital stock representing a consolidated
company, owning and operating a railroad in several States.
But "the road, fixtures, and appurtenances" are declared to
be exempt from taxation only "until after it," that is, the
company, "pays an interest of not less than ten per cent. per

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

annum." And it is argued that this exemption necessarily
implies that the property and operations of the company shall
be preserved separate from those of any other, so that, at all
times, it may be ascertained, by an inspection of accounts,
whether the earnings equal an interest of ten per cent. per
annum; a separation, it is insisted, which is inconsistent with
a consolidation such as took place. And the case, it is said, is
thus brought within the principle of the decision in Railroad,
Compay v. -Haine,96 U. S. 499.
We do not find it necessary to pass upon either of these
questions, however, as there is a distinct ground, which is conclusive of the controversy, upon which we prefer to rest our
decision.
We assume that the consolidation as made was authorized
by, and must be referred to, the tenth section of the charter of
the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company; but we do not admit, what is assumed as an inference from that, that the consolidation took effect, by relation, as of the date of that
charter.
The consolidated company, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain
and Southern Railway Company, the plaintiff in error, is not
the identical corporation which was the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company. The terms of the act and agreement of consolidation, which, by the express language of the charter of the
Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, became on adoption the
charter of the consolidated company, created a new corporation.
it is spoken of as "the new company" in the resolutions of
the board of directors, subnitting the agreement to the stockholders for their approval, and directing the president to cause
the same to be carried into effect, when approved, by calling
in "the certificates of stock in this company outstanding," and
exchanging them "for stock in the new company, according to
the terms of the agreement." The two corporations agree to
become one corporation, and a new name is given to the "new
corporation." It is spoken of as such throughout the agreement of consolidation. The whole organization is changed
and made new. The capital stock is made different from that

ST. LOUIS, &c., RAILWAY CO. v. BERRY.
Opinion of the Court.

-ofeither, or the aggregate of both, each share of stock held in
the Cairo and Fulton Railrdad Company being ,exchanged for
sixty-hundredths of a share in the St. Louis, Iron Mountain
and Southern Railway Company. The act of consolidation is
declared to be a conveyance of all the rights, privileges and
franchises of each of the constituent corporations, and of all
other property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due, on
whatever account, belonging to each corporation, to the new
corporation, without further act or deed.
This new corporation did not come into existence until May
4, 1874. It came into existence as a corporation of the State
of Arkansas in pursuance of its Constitution and laws, and
subject in all respects to their restrictions and limitations.
Among these was that one (Ait. 5, see. 48 of the Constitution
of 1868) which declared that "the property of corporations,
now existing or hereafter created, shall forever be subject to
taxation the same as property of individuals."' This rendered
it impossible in law for the consolidated corporation to receive
by transfer from the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company or
otherwise the exemption sought to be enforced in this suit.
The case is thus brought within the rule declared and applied
in Louimille, &c., Railroad Co. v. PalZme8, 109 U. S. 244.
It is not an answer to this conclusion to say that the act of
consolidation, having been made in pursuance of the tenth section of the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company,
was the exercise by that company of a right secured to it by
contract which no subsequent Constitution or law of the State
of Arkansas could impair or defeat. For what was the contract? - Construed in the most liberal spirit in favor of the
company, it cannot be extended beyond a stipulation on the
part of the State, that the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company
may at any time thereafter, by consolidation with any other
railroad company, form and become a new corporation, with
such powers and privileges as, at the time when the offer is
accepted and acted upon it may be within the power of the State
to confer, and lawful for the new corporation to accept. If
acted upon before the law was'changed, it might well be that
all the powers ,and privileges originally conferred in the char-

Syllabus.

ter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, including the
exemption in question, would have vested in the new company.
But, as it was not accepted and acted upon Lmtil a change in
the organic law of the State forbade the creation of corpora,
tions capable of holding property exempt from taxation, it must
be presumed that when the original company entered into the
consolidation it did so in full view of the existing law, and with
the intention of forming a new corporation, such as the Constitution.and laws of the State at that time permitted. That,
at least, we must hold to be the legal effect of the transaction.
In that viewtjhe language used by this court at the present
term in the case of the .A'emphd and -LitteRock Railroad
Co. (as reorganized) v. Berry et al., 112 U. S. 609, is strictly
applicable and is now re-affirmed.
The conclusion is unavoidable, that the exemption from taxation declared in the eleventh section of the charter of the
.Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company did not pass by the act
of consolidation to the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern
Railway Company.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is therefore
Affirmed.
