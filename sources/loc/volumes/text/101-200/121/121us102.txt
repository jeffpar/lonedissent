stated. It may not have been so presented until after the
expiration of the period within which it would have been cognizable by the Court of Claims, had suit been.brought thereon
without first filing the claim in the Department. Whether, in
that event, the bar of limitation was removed by the mere
fact that the claim was transmitted to the court below by the
Interior Department, is a matter upoii which we express no
opinion.. No such question is formally raised, and, in'view of
the conclusion reached, it is -not necessary to determine it..
We rest our decision solely upon the ground that the contract
of April 5, 1882, imposed no legal obligation upon the United
States.

actively engagecl in practising his said profession as an attorney-at-law; that he has duly and regularly paid to the State
of Virginia all license taxes assessed upon his said business as
an attorney-at-law each year since he commenced practising
his said profession; that on the first day of May, 1886, he
tendered to Samuel 0, Greenhow, who is treasurer of the city
of Richmond, Virginia, one coupon for $15 and ten dollars in
United States Treasury notes in payment of his license -tax as
an attorney-at-law for the ensuing year (all his license, tax up
to that date having been paid in full), and also seventy-five
eents in silver coin for the fee of the coinmission โข of the

1871, entitled "An act to provide for the fundin- and payment of the public debt; that it' was overdue and past maturity and bore upon its face the contract of the State of Virginia that it should be received in payment of all taxes, debts,
and demands due to the said state; that when he made said
tender he demanded of said Greenhow a certificate in writing
stating that he had deposited with him said coupon and
money, but the said Greenhow refused to receive said coupon
and money except for verification and identification, as provided for by an act of the General Assembly of the State of

after it should have been. so verified, or, if defendant would
pay in lawful money, he would receive said coupo n for verification, au upon its verification he would refuril said money

GRANT v. PIENIX LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Argued March 24, 25,1887. -Decided

April 4, 1887.

A cestui qui trust under twenty-six trust deeds of land, executed to five different sets of trustees, to secure the payment of money, filed a bill in
equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to procure a
sale of the land. Some of the deeds covered only a part of the land.
One of them covered the whole. All of the trustees were made defendants, and the bill was taken pro confesso as to all of them. As to the
trustees in twenty-two of the deeds, the bill alleged that they had declined to execute the trusts. The holders of judgments and mechanics'
liens and purchasers of some of the land were made defendants. Some
of the trust deeds did not specify any length of notice of the time and
place of sale by advertisement. The bill alleged the insolvency of the
grantor and the inadequate value of the land to pay the liens. On an
objection by the grantor that the cestui que trust could not maintain the
bill: Held, that the objection could not be sustained.
The bill was not multifarious.
The Special Term made a decree for the sale of the land, without hearing
evidence on issues raised by the pleadings. On appeal, the General
Term reversed the decree, and remanded the cause to the Special Term
for further proceedings, with permission to the parties to apply to the
Special Term for leave to amend their pleadings; Held, that this was a
proper order under ยง 772 of the Revised Statutes of the District of
Columbia.
A decree in a prior suit held not to be pleadable as res adjudicata, in view of
the proceedings in that-suit.
