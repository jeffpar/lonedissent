CLEVELAND ROLLING MILL v. RHODES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE IEMED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Argued March 29, 1887. -Decided

April 11, 1887.

A merchant agreed in writing with the owner of a rolling mill to sell him
"the entire product of 14,000 tons iron ore, to be manufactured into pig
iron with charcoal" at the furnace of a third person, "and shipped in
vessel cargoes, as rapidly as possible, during the season of navigation
of 1880," to the buyer's mill, and "stlch portion of the product of said
ore, as Is made after the close of navigation of 1880, Is to be shipped on
the opening of navigation of 1881, or as near the opening as possible,"
but the buyer to have the privilege of ordering this portion to be forwarded by railroad during the winter of 1880-81. The whole amount of
pig iron made from the 14,000 tons of ore was 8000 tons, of which 3421
tbns were shipped before the close of navigation in 1880, and accepted
and paid for. For want of a sufficient supply of charcoal to keep the
furnace at work, only 3506 tons more were made and ready for shipment
by the opening of navigation in 1881, and were then shipped as soon as
possible; and the remaining 1073 tons were made afterwards, and shipped
from time to time during the ensuing two months. Held, that the buyer
miglIt refuse to accept the iron shipped in 1881.

Tmis was an action brought by- Rhodes and Bradley, copartners, and citizens of Chicago in the State of Illinois,
against the Cleveland Rolling M Company, a corporation
of the State of Ohio, upon the .following agreement in writing, signed by both parties:
"This agreement, made this sixteenth day of February,
1880, by and between Rhodes & Bradley, of Chicago, Ill.,
and the Cleveland Rolling Mill Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, witnesseth: That said Rhodes & Bradley have sold'to the said
Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. the entire product of fourteen
thousand (14,000) tons iron ore, to. be manufactured into pig
iron with charcoal by the Leland Furnace Co., of Leland,
Mich., said furnace to make as nearly all numbers one and two
iron as possible, and to be shipped in vessel cargoes as rapidly
as possible to the Cleveland Rolling Mill Co., at Cleveland,
Ohio, during the season of navigation of 1880. Such portion

of the product of said ores, as is made after the close of navigation of 1880, is to be shipped by vessel to Cleveland on the
opening of navigation of 1881, or as near the opening as possible; said Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. to have the privilege of
ordering the iron, which may be made too late for shipment by
lake during the season of 1880, through by rail to Cleveland
during the winter of 1880 and 1881, they to pay tile additional
expense of hauling to railroad and freighting through to Cleveland by rail, over and above what it would cost Rhodes &
Bradley to ship by lake on the opening of navigation 1881.
"Said Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. agree to receive said iron
as rapidly as shipped, and to pay forty-five dollars ($45) per
ton (2,240 lbs.) cash for same delivered on rail or vessel at
Cleveland, Ohio. The Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. are to have
the option of taking a portion of the iron delivered at Chicago,
Ill., at the same price and on the same terms and conditions
as stated above for delivery in Cleveland, said Cleveland Rolling Mil Co. to furnish good and suitable dock at which to
unload vessels, either at Cleveland or Chieago, and to pay
vessels any demurrage which they may be justly entitled to
by reason of delay in furnishing a dock at which they can be
discharged.
"The iron ore to be furnished at the Leland Iron Co., out
of which said iron-is to be manufactured, is as follows:
"6000 tons Cleveland mine.
"5000 tons Ngorway mine.
"1500 tons Rolling Mill mine.
"1500 tons Stephenson mine.
"And Whereas Rhodes & Bradley's contracts with said
mining companies are to the effect that in case of accidents or
strikes at said mines, resulting in reduced output of ore, said
companies are to have the privilege of reducing the amounts
due Rhodes & Bradley, as above stated, in same proportion
as bther sales, the said Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. agree not
to hold Rhodes & Bradley responsible for delivery of pig
iron beyond the product of such ores as the mining companies
deliver them; also, in case of accidents or strikes at said
Leland furnace, resulting in the stoppage of said furnace,

then Rhbdes & Bradley are not to be held responsible for
dplivery of pig iron under the contract, beyond the responsibility of the Leland Iron Co. to them under the contract be-:
tween said Leland Iron Co. and Rhodes & Bradley, dated
January 14, 1880, which contract, as well as Rhodes &
Bradley's contracts with the mining companies, is hereby
miade-a , art of this agreement."
Prior to January 14, 1880, the plaintiffs had made. agreements in writing with the owners of the four mines for the
purchase of the amounts of ore above mentioned, to be delivered by them to. the plaintiffs during the season of navigation in 1880. And on January 14, 1880, the plaintiffs made
an bgreement in writing with the Leland Iron Company,
which was the owner and manager of a furnace at Leland
in the State of Michigan, by which the plaintiffs agreed to sell
to that company the same amounts of those ores respectively,
"to be furnished, 1500 tons in May, 1880, navigation permitting, and 2500 tons each month thereafter as nearly as may
be, and all to be delivered to vessel before November,1, 1880,
and in suitable quantities of each for the mixtures desired by
said Rhodes & Bradley;" and also agreed "to purchase the
entire product of pig iron of the Leland furnace made from
the ores so furnished, at the -rate of $40 per ton, cash, delivered over the rail at Chicago, or $40.25, cash, at Cleveland,
at the option of said Rhodes and Bradley, they to provide
proper docking facilities for prompt unloading of vessels;"
and the Leland Iron Company agreed "to manufacture pigiron from said ores as nearly as practicable of the grades which
said Rhodes & Bradley shall desire, and to ship same in.
cargo lots as rapidly as possible after manufacture during season of navigation to said Rhodes & Bradley, to Chicago or
Cleveland as aforesaid."
A jury was duly waived by stipulation in writing, and the
case was tried by the court, which found specially that all the
above contracts were executed and delivered by the parties
thereto, and further pecially found as follows:
"3. That the plaintiffs, between May 16 and October 18,
1880, delivered to the Leland Iron Company, at Leland, MichVOL. CXXI-17

Cleveland mine, 4405 tons were from the Norway mine, ,1478
tons were from the Rblling Mill mii e, and 2305 tohswere from the Stephenson mine.
"4. That the ores from the, Stephenson nine and the Qres
from the Norway mine were alike in value ;ana quality, and
that Stephenson mine ore was equally as good and identical in
quality and value with the ore frln the Noway mine.
"5. That the Leland Iron Company proceeded, so6n -after.
such ores began to arrive at"Leland, with' proper diligence t6
manufacture said*ores into pig iron, and ship the sanie in cargo
lots as rapidly as possible after, manufacture from Leland to
Cleveland, Ohio, and'there delivered the same to the defendant, and the defendant accepted and paid for the same; that
before the close of navigation for the season of 1880 the Leland
Iron Company had so mahufactured and delivered to the
defendant 3421 tbns of said pig iron; that the defendant made
no objection to the acceptance of said-pig iron on said contract
between the plaintiffs andthe defendant, on the ground of the
quality of said iron, or of undue delay in the execution of said
contract.
."6. That the navigation between Leland and Cleveland and
Chicago closed in the fall of 1880 about November 15; that
the last cargo of iron was- shipped from Leland on November
8, and although the Leland'Iron Company.had enough iron
manufactured to have furnished another cargo of 502 tons by
November 15, no vessei could be obtained by which' to ship it
,that fall; that after the close of navigation the Leland Iron
Company continued the manufacture of said ore into pig iron
withouf unreasonable delay, and that after N6vember 8, 1880,
and up to and including February 28, 1881, the Leland Iron
Company had made 2100 tons of pig iron from said ore, and
by -May '7, 1881, had maiiufactured and on hand ready for
shipment about 3506 tons.; that on May T, 1881, the Leland
Iron Company rfesumed the shipment of said iron in cargo lots
to the defendant at Cleveland, and continued such manufacture and shipment in cargo lots as rapidly as possible, so that
the entire product of said ore was manufactured and shipped

"

from Leland by and including July 2, 1881; all which cargoes
arrived at Cleveland in due course, and were there tendered to
'the defendant, and the' defendant refused to cept said' pig
iron or any part thereof and refused to pay for the same;
'that if the average daily product of said furnace from November 8, 1880, to May 8, 1881, had been the same-as the averagez
daily product from May 18, to November 8, 1880, all -said
14,000 tons of ore would have been made into pig iron by.
about May 10, 1881; but in fact the furnace was shut down
for a time, and part of the time the blast was checked, 'for
want of a sufficient supply of charcoal, so that about 1100 tons
of said pig iron were made after May 8, 1881.
"7. That in the latter part of the month of February, and
again about March 3, 1881, the defendant notified the plaintiffs that itwould not accept, under said contract of February
16, 1880, any iron .which was made from said ore after IDecember 31, 1880 ; and that some time during the month of May,
1881, the defendant notified the plaintiffs that it would not
accept any more iron from the plaintiffs under said cQntract.
" 8. That the fair market price of said pig iron in the cities
of Cleveland and Chicago during the months of March, Apil,
May,. June, and July, 1881, was $27 per ton; that the total
amount of iron manufactured from said 14,000 tons of iron
[ore] and shipped by the Leland Company to the defendant"
after the opening of navigation in the spring of 1881 was 4579
tons; and that-the difference between the market 'value of
$27 per ton and the contract price was $18 per ton making a
total difference on 4579 tons of 882,422."
The court rendered judgment upon the special findings for.
the plaintiffs in the suii of '$82,422, and costs. [7 Fe+ lRep.

MR.Jusnc GRAY, after stating the case as above reported,
delivered the opinion of the court.
The original defendant duly pleaded, and has earnestly
argued, that the plaintiffs did not pbrform their contract, in
respect either to the nature of the thing furnished, or to its
quantity, or to the time of delivery. The principal objections,
each of which would require c6nsideration if the decision of
the case depended upon it, are as follows:,
As to the nature of the thing: That the amounts of ore
from each of the four mines named, delivered at the furnace
and there 'manufactured into pig iron, differed from the
amounts contracted for, the ores from three of the mines being
respectively 20 tons, 595 tons and 22 tons less, and the ore
from the fourth mine 805 tons more.
As to the quantity: That the plaintiffs tendered to the de-

261

Opinion of the Court.

fendant thb product of 14,168 tons-of ore, when the contract
was for the product of 14,000 tons only.
As to the time of performance: That the pig iron was not
made and shipped "as rapidly as possible;" and especially
that so much of it as had not been made and shipped before
the close of navigation in 1880 was not shipped "op. the opening of navigation of 1881, or as near the opening as possible."
We have not found it necessary to consider the objections
as to the kind of iron, or how far any such objections were
waived by the defendant, or the effect of teidering too much,
or yet the objections to-the competency of evidence admitted
at the trial, or the variance suggested between the declaration
and the proof, because we are of opinion that the delay which
took place in the making and shipment of so much of the pig
iron as had not been made' and shipped before the close of
navigation in 1880 is fatal to the plaintiffs' right. to maintain
this acion.
In a case decided upon much consideration at the last term,
the general rule was -stated as follows: ."In the'contracts of
merchants, time is of the essence. The time of shipment is
the usual and convenient means of fixing the probable time of
arrival, with a view of providing funds to pay for the goods,
or of fulfilling contracts with .third persons. A statement descriptive of the subject matter, or of some material incident,
such as the. time or place of shipment, is ordinarily to be
regarded as a warranty, in the sense in which that term is
used in insurance and maritime law, that is to say, a condition precedent, upon the failure or non-performance of Which
the party aggrieved may' repudiate the whole contract."

Pope, 115 U. S. 213; Pope v. Porter,102 N. Y. 366; Rommel,
v. Wingate, 103 Mffass. 327.
When a merchant agrees to sell, and to ship to the rolling
mill of the buyer, a certain number of tons of pig iron at a
certain time, both the amount of iron and the time of ship-,
ment are essential- terms of the agreement; the seller does not
perform his agreement, by shipping part of that amount at
the time appointed and the rest from time to time afterwards;

Opinion of -the Coult.

and the buyer is not bound to accept any part of the iron so
shipped.
In the case at bar, the plaintiffs were merchants at Chicago,
and the defendant was the owner of a rolling mill at Cleveland. By the agreement between them, made in February,
1880, the plaintiffs sell to the defendant "the entire product
of 14,000 tons iron ore, to be manufactured into pig iron with,
charcoal" at a certain furnace, "and to be shipped in vessel cargoes as rapidly as possible" to the defendant at Cleveland,
" during the season of navigation of 1880,' and "such portion
of the product of said ores, as is made after the close of navigation of 1880, is to be shipped by vessel to Cleveland on the
opening of navigation of 1881, or as near the opening as possible." The plaintiffs thus agree that all of the pig iron contracted for, that is not made and shipped before the close of
nayigation in 1880, shall be shipped as early in 1881 as navigation shall be open and vessels can be obtained. This implies
that the- whole of the ore shall be made into .pig iron and
ready for shipment as soon as navigation opens in 1881. The
implication is confirmed by the futher stipulation that the
defendant shall have the privilege, 'upon paying the additional
expense of transportation by land, ."of ordering the iron,
which may be made too late for shipment by lake during the
season of 1880, through by rail to Cleveland during the winter of 1880 and 1881." In short, all the pig iron, ndt shipped
before the close of navigation in 1880, is- to be made before
the opening of navigation in 1881, and to be then shipped as
soon as vessels c'n be obtained, unless the defendant elects to'
have it.
previously forwarded by land.
- The facts, as found by the court, bear'ng upon the question
of the plaintiffs' performance of their agreemefnt in this 'particular, are ag follows: The whole amount of pig iron made
from the 14,000 tons of ore Was 8000 tons. Of these, 3421
tons were shipped in 1880, and accepted and paid for by the
defendant. At the opening of navigation, early in May, 1881,
there were manufactured and on hand ready for shipment
only 3506 tons. The remaining 1073 tons were made afterwards, and the last cargo was not shipped until nearly two
months after navigation opened.

CLEVELAND ROLLING MILL v. 1111ODES,

263

Opinion of the Court.

The general statements in the sixth finding, that the owner.
of the furnace, after the close of navigation.in 1880, "cbiitinned the manufacture of said ore into pig iron without
unreasonable delay," and on the opening of navigation in 1881
resumed the shipment of. iron to the defendant, "aid continued such manufacture and shipment in cargo lots as rapidly
as possible," are limited and controlled by the more precise
statements in the same finding, that if the average daily
product of the futrnace had been the swne from the close of
navigation in 1880 to the oliening of navigation in 1881, as it
had been during the season of 1880, -11l said 14,000 tons of
ore ivould have been made into pig iron b about, May 10,
1881; but in fact the furna'e was shut down for a time, and
part of the time the blast was checked, for want of a sufucient supply of charcoal, so that about 1100 tons of said pig
iron were made after Mar 8,. 1881."
The failure to have on hand a sufficient amount of charcoal
to keep the furnace at work is not shown to have been due to
"accidents or strikes;" which were contingencies contemplated
by all parties, and provided for in the contract sued on. -But
it was a state of thin s of which -the plaintiffs assumed .the
risk by undertaking that. the whole of the ore should be made
into pig iron ready to be shipped as soon as possiblb after .theopening of navigation in 1881..
After the contract for 8000 tons of pig iron had been partly
performed on both sides in 1880, by the plaintiffs' having delivered, and the defen'dant's having accepted and paid for, 3421
tons of iron, then the thing which, by the*terms of so much
of the contract as was yet unperformed, the plaintiffs agreed
to deliver, and the defendant agreed to take and pay for, was
4579 tons of pig iron, made and ready for shipment upon the
opening of navigati6n in 1881, and then shipped as rapidly a
possible; and the rights. and duties of the 1parties as to the
.perfcrmance of this part of the consract were the same as if
it had been the 'whole contract between them.
. The true construction of the contract being that that amount
of iron shall be ready to be shipped and, be actually shipped
as soon as navigation permits, "that is par of the.description

of the subject matter of what i sold;" and "the plaintiff,
whu sues upon that contract, has not launched his case until
he has shown that he has tendered the thing whi6h has been:
contracted for, and if he is unable to show that, he cannot
claim any damages for the nonfulfilment of the contract."
Lord Cairns, in. Bowes v. S7Und, 2 App. Cas. 455, 468; _for-'
rington v. Wright, 115 U. S. 188, 209.
The necessary conclusion is that the defendant was justified
in refusing to accept any of the'iron shipped in 1881; and
whether the notice; previously given by the defendant to the
plaintiff, that it would. not accept under the contract any iron
made aft~r December '31, 1880, might. have ben treated by
the plaintiffs as a renunciation and a breach of the contract,
need not be considered, because- the plaitiffs did not act upon
it as such. -Dingley v. Oler, 117 U. S. 490, 503.
It'conclusively appearing, upon the-facts found by the court
below, that the original plaintiffs cannot maintain their action,
it is ordered, in accordance with the precedents of -FortScott
v. Mckma?, 112 U. S. 150, and Allen v. t. Louis ank, 120
U. S. 20, that the
Judgment be reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit

The d~fendant'agreed, in writing, to purchase from the plaintiff rails to
be rolled by the latter, "and to be drilled as may.be directed," and to
pay for them $58 per ton. He refused to give directions for drilling,
and, at his request, the plaintiff delayed rolling any of the rails until
after the time prescribed for their delivery, and then the defendant
advised the plaintiff that he should decline to take any rails under the
contract: Held,
