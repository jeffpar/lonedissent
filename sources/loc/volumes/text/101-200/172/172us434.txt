ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLvANIA.
No. 15. Argued November 10, 1898. -Decided

January 9,1899.

An Indictment based upon that portion of Rev. Stat. 3082, which makes It
an offence to "fraudulently or knowingly import or bring into the United
States, or assist in doing so, any merchandise contrary to law," charging
,.that the defendant, on a date named, "did knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully import and bring into the United States, and did assist in importing and bringing into the United States, to wit, into the port of
Philadelphia," diamonds of a stated value, "contrary to law, and the
provisions of the act of Congress in such cases made and provided" Is
clearly insufficient, as the allegations are too general, and do not sufficiently inform the defendant of the nature of the accusation against
him.
An indictment for a violation of Rev. Stat. ยง 2865, which charges that the
defendant "did knowingly, wilfully and unlawfully, and with intent to
defraud the revenue of the United States, smuggle and clandestinely
introduce into the United States, to wit, into the port of Philadelphia,"
certain "diamonds" of a stated value, which should have been invoiced
and duty thereon paid or accounted for, but which, to the knowledge of
the defendant and with intent to defraud the revenue, were not Invoiced
