v. UNITED STATES.
Syllabus.

and that "if it shall appear to the judge upon such trial that
there are questions of fact arising upon the issues therein, of
such a character that the judge would submit them to the jury
if one were present," they should bo submitted to a jury at the
next term of the court; and the only finding of the judge was
a general finding for the plaintiff.
The trial thus ordered, consented to and had, was neither a
trial by jury, nor a trial by the court, in accordance with the
acts of Congress, but was a trial by the judge as a referee.
The trial deriving its whole efficacy from the consent of the
parties, the bill of exceptions allowed at that trial was irregular
and unavailing, and the facts stated in that bill of exceptions
cannot be regarded, nor the rulings stated therein reviewed,
by this court. As the questions argued by the plaintiff in
error do not appear of record independently of the bill of exceptions, this court has no authority to pass upon them, and
no error is shown in the judgment afterwards rendered by ho
Circuit Court. Campbell v. Boyreau, above cited; Lyons v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Statement of the Case.

THE case, as stated by the court in its opinion, was as

follows:
On the 21st day of June, 1883, the Secretary of the Treasury,
pursuant to § 1063 of the Revised Statutes, and in compliance
with the certificate of the Second Comptroller of the Treasury,
transmitted to the Court of Claims the claim of Adam Badeau
for pay as an officer of the United States Army, "together
with all the vouchers, papers, documents and proofs pertaining
thereto, that the same might be proceeded in, in said court, as
if originally commenced therein by the voluntary action of the
claimant;" and thereafter upon the 19th day of February,
1884, the claimant filed his petition in which, after making
certain averments, and stating that he was secretary of legation at London from May 19 to December 6, 1869, and consulgeneral at London, April 28, 1870, to September 16, 1881, and
at Havana, Cuba, from N'ovember 25, 1882, to the date of the
filing of the petition, and that he had received pay as a military officer from December 6, 1869, to April 30, 1870, and from
September 16, 1881, to November 25, 1882, he claimed to be
entitled to "the amount of pay and allowances of a captain,
mounted, retired from active service, for the period from April
28, 1870, to September 16, 1881, and from November 25, 1882,
up to the present time, amounting to the sum of eighteen
thousand eight hundred and fifty-two dollars and sixty-five
cents, not having received such pay or allowances during said
period; also, to the additional pay and allowance provided by
§ 1262 of the Revised Statutes, which section is as follows:
"There shall be allowed and paid to each commissioned officer
below the rank of brigadier-general, including chaplains and
others having assimilated rank or pay, ten per centum of their
current yearly pay for each term of five years of service."
A general traverse was filed by the United States, March 8,
1884, and on the 10th of February, 1885, a counter-claim, stating
"that Adam Badeau, the claimant in the above entitled cause,
before and at the time of the commencement of this suit was,
and still is, indebted to the said defendants in a large sum of
money, to wit, two thousand five hundred and sixty dollars

Statement of the Case.

and ten cents, ($2560.10,) for money erroneously paid to said
Badeau without authority of law, the same being on account
of payments of salary made to him as an army officer, (captain,
retired,) from December 31, 1869, to October 31, 1882, during
all of which time said Badeau was not in fact in the army nor
an officer thereof;" to which the claimant filed a replication
March 9, 1885.
The United States also pleaded the statute of limitations to
the larger part of petitioner's claim.
Findings of fact and conclusions of law were announced by
the Court of Claims, May 9, 1887, as follows:
I. On the 21st April, 1869, the claimant, then being a first
lieutenant of infantry in the army of the United States,
unassigned, was appointed by the President assistant secretary
of legation at London. On the 19th May, 1869, he accepted
the appointment, filed in the Department of State his oath of
office, and embarked for his post, reaching England May 31st,
1869.
II. On the 15th M ay, 1869, a military board was convened
by the following order:

v. U NITED STATES.

Statement of the Case.

On the 22d May, 1869, this was approved by the Secretary
of War, and on the 25th May the President made the following order:
[Special Orders, INo. 126 - Extract.]
HEADQUARTERS OF THE Amiy,

WASHINGTON, Aay 25,1869.

12. Brevet Brigadier General Adam Badeau, 1st lieutenant
U. S. Army, having, at his own request, been ordered before a
board of examination, and having been found "incapacitated
for active service, and that said incapacity is due to a wound
received in the foot whilst on duty as captain and additional
aide-de-camp to Brigadier General T. W. Sherman in the
assault on Port Hudson in May, 1863," the President directs
that his name be placed upon the list of retired officers of that
class in which the disability results from long and faithful
service, or from some injury incident thereto, in accordance
with § 16 and 17 of the act approved August 3, 1861. In
accordance with § 32 of the act approved July 28, 1866,
General Badeau is, by direction of the President, retired with
the full rank of captain, to date from May 18, 1869.
By command of General Sherman.

E. D. TowNsF-,

III. The claimant held the office of assistant secretary of
legation, and received the salary thereof, until the 6th December, 1869, when he resigned.
By order of the President
December 23, 1869, he was "assigned to duty in the city of
Washington" as an officer of the army, it being stated that
the order was to date from December 6, 1869. He drew from
the pay department of the army the pay of an active captain
for the period from December 6, 1869, to February 21, 1870,
and the pay of a retired captain from February 21, 1870, to
April 30, 1870, the pay so drawn amounting to $621.84. He

1870, and was in the consular service of the government until
the commencement of this suit, except for a period of about
fourteen months, beginning in September, 1881, and ending in
November, 1882.
IV. From May, 1869, until May, 1878, the claimant was
borne upon the retired list of the army as having been retired
with the rank of captain on the 18th May, 1869. On the 7th
May, 1878, the following order was 'issued:

for which lie was retired, can be regarded as bringing him
within that class of officers specified in the proviso of § 2, act

Statement of the Case.

Whereupon the Secretary of War, on the 3d July, 1878,
made the following order, under which the claimant was
borne on the retired list of the army up to the time of his
bringing this action:
WAR DEPARTMENT, July 3, 1878.
Respectfully returned to the Adjutant General of the army.
The former decision in Captain Badeau's case was correct,
as the record then stood, but it now appearing that his case
comes clearly within the provisions of the proviso to § 2, act
of March 3, 1875, his name will be restored to the retired list.
GEORGE W. McORAIRY,

Secre"a

of War.

V. From the 18th May, 1869, to the 6th December, 1869,
the claimant received no pay as a military officer, nor has he
received military pay at any time while holding a diplomatic
or consular office.
From the 6th December, 1869, to the 21st February, 1870,
while assigned to duty in the city of Washington as a retired
officer under the act 21st January, 1870, (16 Stat. 22,) the
claimant was paid as a captain in active service the sum of
$396.92, during which period he was rendering service as an
officer.
From the 21st of February, 1870, to the 31st October, 1882,
the claimant was paid as an officer on the retired list, for
periods when he was not holding a diplomatic or consular
office, the sum of $2163.18.
There has been withheld from the claimant while not holding a diplomatic or consular office his pay as a retired officer
from November 1, 1882, to November 25, 1882, amounting

There has been withheld from the claimant while holding a
diplomatic or consular office between the 19th May, 1869, and
the 19th February, 1884, when this action was brought, his
pay as a retired officer, amounting to the sum of $

the foregoing claims accrued, and his petition was filed in this
court within three years after the disability had ceased.

v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.
CONCLUSIONS

OF LAW.

The court being equally divided upon the foregoing findings
as to the claimant's right to recover, does, for the purposes of
an appeal, frame the following conclusions of law:
The petition of the claimant and the counter-claim of the
defendants should both be dismissed.
Thereupon judgment was entered dismissing the petition of
the claimant and the counter-claim of the United States. Appeals were prosecuted by both parties to this court, and the
records filed herein August 10 and October 5, 1887.
On the 5th of October, 1888, a stipulation was filed, adding
to the record certain conclusions and order of the Court of
Claims and certain matters introduced in evidence, at a stage
of the case prior to the final findings.
.Mr.Daniel P. Hays for Badeau.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Howard and Mr. F. P.
Dewees for the United States.
MR. CHIEF JusTIcE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the

court.

Section 2 of the act of March 30, 1868, entitled "An act
making appropriations for the consular and diplomatic expenses of the government for the year ending thirtieth June,
1869, and for other purposes," (15 Stat. 56, 58,) is as follows:
"That any officer of the Army or Navy of the United States
who shall, after the passage of this act, accept or hold any
appointment in the diplomatic or consular service of the government, shall be considered as having resigned his said office,
and the place held by him in the military or naval service
shall be deemed and taken to be vacant, and shall be filled in
the same manner as if the said officer had resigned the same."
This was carried into the Revised Statutes (1874) as § 1223.
By § 18, c. 42, act of August 3, 1861, (12 Stat. 290,) it was
provided "that the officers partially retired shall be entitled
to wear the uniform of their respective grades, shall continue

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

to be borne upon the Army Register or Navy Register, as the
case may be, and shall be subject to the rules and articles of
war, and to trial by general court-martial for any breach of
the said articles." And this was re-enacted as § 1256 of the
Revised Statutes.
By § 16 of the said act of August 3, 1861, it was provided
"that there shall not be on the retired list at any one time
more than seven per centum of the whole number of the officers of the Army as fixed by law," while by § 5 of the act of
July 15, 1870 (16 Stat. $17), "the number of officers who may
be retired in accordance with existing laws shall be in the discretion of the President: .Provided, That the whole number
on the retired list shall at no time exceed three hundred;"
and this reappears as § 1258 of the Revised Statutes.
By § 23 of the act of July 15, 1870 (16 Stat. 320) "any
retired officer may, on his own application, be detailed to serve
as professor in any college," and such is § 1260 of the Revised
Statutes.
By the first section of "An act relating to retired officers of
the Army," approved January 21, 1870, (16 Stat. 62,) it was
provided "that no retired officer of the Army shall hereafter
be assigned to duty of any kind, or be entitled to receive more
than the pay and allowances provided by law for retired officers of his grade; and all such assignments heretofore made
shall terminate within thirty days from the passage of this
act;" but by resolution of April 6, 1870 (16 Stat. 372) the law
of January 21st was limited so as not to apply "to officers
selected by the Board of Commissioners of the Soldiers' Home,
District of Columbia, for duty at that institution, such selection being approved by the Secretary of War," and this is
re-enacted in § 1259 of the Revised Statutes.
By § 18 of the act of July 15, 1870, already referred to,
(16 Stat. 319,) it was enacted "that it should not be lawful for
any officer of the Army of the United States on the active list
to hold any civil office, whether by election or appointment,
and any such officer accepting or exercising the functions of a
civil office shall at once cease to be an officer of the Army,
and his commission qhall be vacated thereby," and this is carried into the Revised Statutes as § 1222.

BADEAU v. UNITED STATE6.
Opinion of the Court.

Thus in the acts of 1868 and 1870, and in §§ 1222 and 1223
of the Revised Statutes, Congress distinguished, and adhered
to the distinction, between officers on both lists and officers
on the active list only, and between ordinary civil appointments and appointments in the diplomatic or consular service.
No officer, whether on the active or retired list, could accept
appointment in the latter, and remain ar officer, but that rule
was not applied to retired officers in the matter of holding a
civil office.
The second section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875,
reads as follows:
"That all officers of the army who have been heretofore
retired by reason of disability arising from wounds received
in action shall be considered as retired upon the actual rank
held by them, whether in the regular or volunteer service, at
the time when such wound was received, and shall be borne
on the retired list and receive pay hereafter accordingly; and
this section shall be taken and construed to include those now
borne on the retired list, placed upon it on account of wounds
'vided, That no part of the foregoing
received in action: Pr
act shall apply to those officers who had been in service as
commissioned officers twenty-five years at the date of their
retirement; nor to those retired officers who had lost an arm
or leg, or has an arm or leg permanently disabled by reason
of resection, on account of wounds, or both eyes by reason of
wounds received in battle; and every such officer now borne
on the retired list shall be continued thereon, notwithstanding
the provisions of section two, chapter thirty-eight, act of March
thirty, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight: and be it also provrided, That no retired officer shall be affected by this act who
has been retired or may hereafter be retired on the rank held
by him at the time of his retirement; and that all acts or parts
of acts inconsistent herewith be, and are hereby, repealed."
18 Star. 512, c. 1718.
By § 32 of the act of July 28, 1866, (14 Stat. 337,) it was
provided "that officers of the regular Army entitled to be retired on account of disability occasioned by wounds received
in battle, may be retired upon the full rank of the command
VOL. cxxx-29

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

held by them, whether in the regular or volunteer service, at
the time such wounds were received."
It was within the power of Congress to change the rank
here spoken of, and this it did by the act of 1875, which substitutes for "the full rank of the command held by them" the
"actual rank held by them," and which embraces only "those
now borne on the retired list, placed upon it on account of
wounds received in action." WIrood v. United States, 107 U. S.
414, 417. Under this act. officers of twenty-five years' service
at the date of their retirement, and officers who had lost an
arm or leg or had an arm or leg permanently disabled, or both
eyes, were not subject to be considered as retired upon the
actual rank held by them when wounded, as provided in the
first part of the section; and no retired officer was affected by
the act who had been or might be retired on the rank actually
held by him at the time of such retirement; and all officers
mentioned in the first part of the section, or of twenty-five
years' service, or who had lost an arm or leg, etc., could accept
appointment in the diplomatic or consular service, notwithstanding § 2 of the act of March 30, 1868, or § 1223 of the
Revised Statutes, as we think the words "every such officer
now borne on the retired list shall be continued thereon" refer
to all officers previously mentioned in the section, and the provision in this respect shows that up to March 3, 1875, § 2 of
the act of 1868 applied to officers on the retired list as well as
those in active service.
Sections 1763, 1764, and 1765 of the Revised Statutes are as
follows:
"Sec. 1763. No person who holds an office, the salary or
annual compensation attached to which amounts to the sum of
two thousand five hundred dollars, shall receive compensation
for discharging the duties of any other office, unless expressly
authorized by law.
"Sec. 1764. No allowance or compensation shall be made
to any officer or clerk, by reason of the discharge of duties
which belong to any other officer or clerk in the same or any
other department; and no allowance or compensation shall be
made for any extra services whatever, which any officer or

BADEAU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

clerk may be required to perform, unless expressly authorized
by law.
"Sec. 1765. No officer in any branch of the public service,

or any other person whose salary, pay, or emoluments are fixed
by law or regulations, shall receive any additional pay, extra
allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever, for the disbursement of public money, or for any other service or duty
whatever, unless the same is authorized by law, and the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional
pay, extra allowance, or compensation."
Whether by the order of the Secretary of War, July 3, 1878,
the claimant's name was properly restored to the retired list
we are not called upon to determine in this case, because even
were that so we do not think his petition can be sustained.
General Badeau received as consul general at London an
annual salary of seventy-five hundred dollars, and at Havana,
of six thousand dollars, as fixed by law, and was expressly inhibited from receiving any additional salary, allowance, pay,
or compensation for discharging the duties of any other office
unless expressly authorized by law, of which there is no pretence in this case. It has been decided that a person holding
two offices or employments under the, government, when the
services rendered or which might be required under them, were
not incompatible, is not precluded from receiving the salary or
compensation of both. Converse v. United States, 21 How.
463; United States v. Brindle, 110 U. S. 688. But the Treasury Department did not apparently regard this case as falling
within that exception, and we agree with that conclusion.
United States v. Shoemhzke, 7 Wall. 338; Stansbuiy v. United
States, 8 Wall. 33; iloyt v. United States, 10 How. 109, 141.
Under the act of 1875 retired officers situated as therein described, are so far taken out of the operation of the act of 1868
as not to be held, if they accept or hold diplomatic or consular
appointment, to have resigned their places in the army; but
this does not change the general policy of the law, and does
not entitle them to pay as army officers during the period of
time when they are absent from their country in the discharge
of continuous official duties inconsistent with subjection to the

OCTOBER TERAI, 1888.
Syllabus.

rules and articles of war, and the other incidents of military
service. Notwithstanding § 1223, such officers, when in the
diplomatic or consular service, may still be borne on the retired
list, but cannot receive double compensation.
Nor can we disturb the judgment adverse to the counterclaim. As between individuals, where money has been paid
under a mistake of law, it cannot be recovered back, but it is
denied that this rule is applicable to the United States, upon
the ground that the government is not bound by the mistakes
of its officers, whether of law or of fact. United States v.
Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720; United States v. Bank of X etrojpolis, 15 Pet. 377; AL?Elrata v. United States, 102 U. S.
426. But inasmuch as the claimant, if not an officer de jure,
acted as an officer defacto, we are not inclined to hold that he
has received money which, ex oguo et bono, he ought to return.
He was paid as a military officer from December 6, 1869, to
the 21st of February, 1870, and for the time from February
21, 1870, to April 30, 1870, and for about fourteen months,
beginning in September, 1881, and ending in November, 1882.
After May 19, 1869, he was employed in a.diplomatic or consular capacity, except during the above specified periods, and
the implication from the findings is that he was paid for those
periods, because he was actually rendering service, whether
subject to assignment thereto or not.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is
