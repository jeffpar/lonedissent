agree that if error intervened it was not prejudicial to the
defendant. The Supreme Court of the Territory treated the
instructions precisely as though given in an action at law,
trials of issues in suits in equity there breing, as already stated,
generally governed by the same incidents as trials of issues in
actions at law. In that view, the instructions axe not, in our
judgment, open to any criticism. It is only as showing the
ruling of the court respecting the inferences deducible from
the prior possession of the plaintiff that we examine them, and
on that subject they express the law correctly. If the trial
were treated as of a feigned issue directed by the court, different considerations would arise. An erroneous ruling in that
case would not necessarily lead to a disturbance of the verdict.

As to the alleged forfeiture set up by defendant, it is sufficient to say that the burden of proving it rested upon him;
that the only pretence of a forfeiture was that sufficient work,
as required by law, each year, was not done on the claim in
1882; and that the evidence adduced by him on that point
was very meagre and unsatisfactory, and was completely overborne by the evidence of the plaintiff. Belk v. Afeagher, 104

clear and convincing proof of the failure of the former owner
to have work performed or improvements made to the amount
required by law.

FOR THE

No. 196. Argued March 12, 13, 1889.-

Decided April 8, 1889.

Between the time when the Process Act of May 8, 1792, 1 Stat. 275, went
into effect, and the passage of the act of June 1, 1872, 17 Stat. 196, (Rev.
Stat. ยง 914,) it was always in the power of the Federal courts, by general

rules, to adapt their practice to the exigencies and conditions of the
times; but since the passage of the latter act the practice, pleadings and
forms and modes of proceeding must conform to the state law and to
the practice of the state courts, except when Congress has legislated
upon a particular subject, and prescribed a rule.
When a state statute prescribes a particular method of serving mesne process, that method must be followed; and this rule is especially exacting
in reference to corporations.
In the construction of a state statute in a matter purely domestic this court
is always strongly disposed to give great weight to the decisions of the
highest tribunal of the State.
The provisions of the Revised Statutes of Wisconsin which require service
of process generally on cities to be "by delivering a copy thereof to the
mayor and city clerk," and the provision of the charter of the city of
Watertown which requires such service to be made by leaving a copy
with the mayor, have been held by the highest court of the State to be
peremptory and to exclude all other officers, and it has also held that the
fact that there is a vacancy in the office of mayor does not authorize
service to be made upon some other substituted officer: and this court
concurs with that court in this construction.
Broughton v. Pensacola,93 U. S. 266, and Mobile v. Watson, 116 U. S. 289,
differ essentially from this case.
A motion to set aside a judgment if made, and service thereof made at the
term at which the judgment is rendered, may be heard and decided at the
next term of the court if properly continued by order of court.

The principal question in this case is, whether the defendant,
the city of Watertown, was served with process in the suit
so as to give the court below jurisdiction over it. In order to
understand the bearing of the fadts of the case, it will be
necessary to give a brief abstract of the laws of Wisconsin
which relate to it, and these are mostly to be found in the

charter of the city of Watertown and the acts supplementary
thereto. The state laws are referred to because they govern
the practice of the Federal courts in the matter under consideration. By the 5th section of the act of June 1st, 1872, Rev.
Stat. ยง 914, it is declared that "the practice, pleadings and
forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, other than
equity and admiralty causes, in the Circuit and District Courts,
shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings and
forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like
causes in the courts of record of the State within which such
Circuit or District Courts are held." Were it not for this statute,
the Circuit Courts themselves could prescribe, by general rule,
the mode of serving process on corporations as well as on other
persons.
By the temporary Process Act of September 29th, 1789,
1 Stat. 93, if not otherwise provided, the forms of writs and
executions, (except their style,) and modes of process in the Circuit and District Courts, in suits at common law, were directed
to be the same as in the Supreme Courts of the States respectively. By the permanent Process Act of May 8, 1792, 1 Stat.
275, it was enacted that the forms of writs, executions and
other process, and the forms and modes of proceeding, in suits
at common law, should be the same as directed by the act of
1789, subject to such alterations and additions as the said
courts should deem expedient, or to such regulations as the
Supreme Court of the United States should think proper by
rule to prescribe to any Circuit or District Court. So that the
practice in United States courts, in the old States, was made
to conform to the state practice, as it was in 1789, subject to
alteration by rule of court. In 1828 a law was passed adopting for the Federal courts in the new States, admitted since
1789, the forms of process, and forms and modes of proceeding of the highest courts of those States respectively, as then
existing, subject to alteration by the courts themselves pr
the Supreme Court of the United States. 4 Stat. 278. By the
act of August 1, 1842, the provisions of the act of 1828 were
extended to the States admitted in the intermediate time.

always in the power of the courts, by general rules, to adapt
their practice to the exigencies and conditions of the times.
But the statute of 1872 is peremptory, and whatever belongs
to the three categories of practice, pleading and forms and
modes of proceeding, must conform to the state law and the
practice of the state courts, except where Congress itself has
legislated upon a particular subject and prescribed a rule. Then,
of course, the act of Congress is to be followed in preference to
the laws of the State. With regard to the mode of serving
mesne process upon corporations and other persons, Congress
has not laid down any rule; and hence the state law and
practice must be followed. There can be no doubt, we think,
that the mode of service of process is within the categories
named in the act. It is part of the practice and mode of proceeding in a suit.
Assuming, therefore, that the question is one to be governed
by the local or state law, we proceed to give an abstract of the
charter of Watertown, and such other laws 6f Wisconsin as
bear upon the subject. We find this mostly made to our band
in the brief of the plaintiffs in error, taken from the consolidated charter of 1865, and it is as follows:
Chapter 1, ยง 3. "The said city shall be divided into seven
wards."
Section 4. "The corporate authority of said city shall be

mayor from the city, or his inability from any cause to discharge the duties of his office, the president shall execute all
the powers and discharge all the duties of mayor. In case the

Chapter 3, ยง 3. "The common council shall have the management and control of the finances and of all the property of

manner prescribed by law for service of process on cities generally is, "by delivering a copy thereof to the mayor and city

clerk." As there was a special law with regard to the city of
Watertown contained in its charter, requiring a copy to be
left with the mayor, the general law probably did not supersede it. But as the mayor must be served with process according to both laws, it can make no difference in the disposition of the case which is assumed to prevail.
We have given these quotations more fully because the
plaintiffs in error seemed to regard them as having some importance in the consideration of the case.
The facts as disclosed by the record are briefly as follows:
On the 3d of March, 1873, the plaintiffs, by their attorneys,
sued out a summons against the defendant to answer a complaint for a certain money demand within twenty days after
service of the summons. On the 6th of March, 1873, the
marshal returned that he had that day served the summons
on the city by delivering a copy of it to the city clerk and city
treasurer. The defendant appeared specially by its attorney,
and moved to set aside the said service on two grounds:
1st. That the summons was not served on the mayor of the
city, as required by its charter.
2d. That it was not served on three residents and freeholders
of the city, as provided by the rules of the court.
Thereupon the plaintiff filed an affidavit of the marshal,
stating that at the time of service of the summons there was
no mayor or acting mayor of said city, and had been none
since the 14th day of February, 1873 (the writ being dated
and issued the third day of March, 1873). The defendant
filed a counter affidavit of the city clerk, stating that he had
examined the records of the city and the proceedings of the
board of street commissioners for the months of January, February, March and April, 1873, and from these it appeared that
F. Kusel, mayor of the city, resigned the office of mayor on
the 30th of January; that from thence to the 24th of February, Street Commissioner Maak was the chairman of the board
of street commissioners and acting mayor of the city; that
from the 24th of February to the 17th of March, Street Commissioner Prentice was temporary chairman of said board,
and acting mayor; and that on the 6th and 8th of March,
1873, said Prentice was acting mayor.

AMY v. WATERTOWN.

No. 1.

Opinion of the Court.

Upon these affidavits the court on the 8th of April, 1873,
heing of opinion that the summons had not been served upon
the defendant in the manner prescribed by law, so as to give
the court jurisdiction of the defendant, or so as to entertain
any motion or proceedings in the case as against the defendant
or on its behalf, unless it appeared, made an order authorizing
the clerk to return the summons to the marshal, to be served
on the defendant according to law, or for such further action
as the defendant (meaning the plaintiffs) might direct conformably to law.
It does not appear from the record that anything further
was done for nearly ten years. On the 23d of December,
1882, the marshal made return of service of said summons as
follows:
"Served on the within-named The City of Watertown by
delivering to Win. H. Rohr, last mayor of said city; Henry
Bieber, city clerk; Chas. H. Gardner, city attorney, and
Thomas Baxter, last presiding officer (or president or ch'm'n)
of the board of street commissioners of said city of Watertown, each personally a copy of the within suinmons and by
showing each of them this original summons this 23d day of
December, 1882, the office of mayor of said city being vacant
and there being no president of the common council or presiding officer thereof in office."
Thereupon, on June 19, 1883, plaintiffs filed their complaint
setting out four bonds of $1000 each, dated June 1, 1856, issued
by the defendant to aid in the construction of the Watertown
and Madison Railroad, and payable January 1, 1877, with eight
per cent interest, payable semi-annually, upon presentation
and surrender of the interest warrants or coupons attached
to the bond; and setting forth, also, eighty-four of such coupons of $40 each, and demanding judgment for the amount
of said coupons, $3360, together with interest at seven per
cent on the amount of each coupon from the time it became
due.
On the same day, June 19, 1883, plaintiffs filed an affidavit
of no answer or appearance, caused the amount due on the
eighty-four coupons to be computed by the clerk, and there-

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

upon the court rendered judgment against the defendant by
default for the amount so found due, to wit, $7762.44 damages
and $849.70costs.
On the 27th day of July, 1883, the defendant appeared
specially for the purpose, and served notice of motion to set
aside the judgment and service on the ground that there had
been no service of summons and the court had no jurisdiction
of defendant. The motion was based upon the affidavits of
Henry Bieber, Thomas Baxter, and William H. Rohr, showing
the following facts:
1. That William H. Rohr, designated in the marshal's return
as the "last mayor of said city," was elected mayor at the
annual municipal election, April 4, 1882, duly qualified and
entered upon the duties of the office, and thereafter, on April
10, 1882, duly resigned the office in writing directed to the
common council and fied his resignation with the city clerk,
and had not since been mayor or acting mayor or president
of the common council.
2. That Charles H. Gardner, named in the return, was
never attorney for defendant in this action, or authorized to
appear or to accept, admit or receive service for it therein.
3. That Thomas Baxter designated in the return as "last
presiding officer (or president or ch'm'n) of the board of street
commissioners of said city," was the senior alderman of the
3d ward, and as such a member of the board of street commissioners of the city, from April 10, 1882, to April 7, 1883.
That but one meeting of said board was held in November,
1882, and that was on November 11, 1882; that no mayor and
no chairman elected by the board to preside at its meeting in
the mayor's absence, being present, William F. Voss, senior
alderman of the 6th ward, and a member of the board, was
chosen by a viva voce vote of the members present chairman
pro tem., to preside at that particular meeting, which, after
the transaction of its business, adjourned on said 11th day of
November, 1882.
That there were only three meetings of said board in December, 1882, to wit, regular meetings December 4th and
18th, and a special meeting December 27th; that there being

AMY v. WATERTOWN.

No. 1.

Opinion of the Court.

no mayor nor chairman elected by the board to preside at its
meetings in the mayor's absence, present at either of said
meetings of December 4th or 27th, said Baxter was chosen at
each said meeting by a viva voce vote of the members present
chairman pro tem. to preside at that particular meeting, and
that said meetings adjourned sine die respectively on December 4th and 27th, after the transaction of their business, and
that said Baxter ceased to be such temporary chairman after
the adjournment of said meetings. That the meeting of
December 18th, being without a quorum, adjourned without
the transaction of any business. And that no meeting of
said board was held after December 27th until January 15th,
1883.
That besides said two meetings in December, said Baxter
had alternated with other members of said board in being
chosen in like manner and under like circumstances temporary
chairman to preside at particular meetings of said board, but
not at said meeting of December 18tb, and that said board
never elected, chose or appointed him chairman thereof, or
chairman to preside at its meetings in the mayor's absence,
and that he never was such chairman or presiding officer, or
anything more than merely chairmanpro tempore of particular
meetings as above.
4. That no copy of the summons had ever been delivered to
the mayor of the city, and no summons in the action served
on the city or mayor, or anything done towards service, except the delivery, December 23, 1882, of four copies, one each
to the clerk, said Baxter, Gardner and Rohr, and delivery
March 6, 187, of a copy to Tauck and Meyer, neither of
whom was mayor, acting mayor, or president of the common
council.
The plaintiff submitted two affidavits of Mr. Winkler, by
which it appears:
1. That the book in the city clerk's office containing the
record of the proceedings of the common council and of the
board of street commissioners for about five years before
January, 1884, contains a record of the meeting of the
common council, April 11, 1882, the last entry of which is

OCTOBER TERAI, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

"the common council adjourned sine die," and that there is
nofturther record of a common council meeting thereafter until
after the municipal election in April, 1883, and that immediately following said record commences the record of a meeting of the board of street commissioners, April 11, 1882, which
is followed by the record of other meetings of the board up to
December 27, 1882, at each of which meetings some member
of the board, either Com. Stacey, Com. Baxter or Com. Voss
was chosen chairman pro Mn., and the record of the adjournment of each meeting is, "On motion the board adjourned,"
and at one of such meetings a resolution was passed retaining
Mr. Daniel Hill -" to assist the city attorney in the suits commenced by E. Mariner."
2. That accounts were audited at said meetings and orders
upon the city treasurer drawn therefor on a subsequent day
and signed by the commissioner who had been chosen chairman pro tem. at the meeting auditing the accounts, and that
the common practice had been to hold meetings of the board
evenings, prepare the orders on a subsequent day, but bearing
the date of the meeting, and they were then signed by the
city clerk and chairman pro tem. chosen at such meeting.
3. That the city clerk said that every alternate Monday had
always, for a series of years, been the regular time for meetings of the common council, if there was one, and of the board
of street commissioners if there was none.
4. The affiant states further, upon information and belief, that for some years prior to 18'19 and since, it has been
the constant practice for the common council to hold one
meeting after the election of aldermen, in April each year,
and then all but the senior aldermen constituting the board of
street commissioners, would resign, and the mayor would, also
resign at the same time.
On the hearing of the motion, May 16, 18.84, the court made
an order setting aside the judgment "on the ground that the
summons herein was not properly served on said defendant,
and the court had no jurisdiction thereof."
To review the
decision of the court in making that order the plaintiffs in error
have sued out the present writ of error.

AM-Y v. WATERTOWN1.

No. 1.

Opinion of the Court.

The errors assigned are:
1. That the court had no jurisdiction or power to vacate the
judgment at a subsequent term.
2. That the return of the marshal showed a valid service
which was not changed by the affidavits.
We have no difficulty with regard to the first question raised
by the plaintiffs in error. It is clear from the record that the
application to set aside the judgment was made at the same
term it was rendered. The judgment was entered on the 19th
day of June, 1883. During the same term, as we infer, (and
it is not disputed,) namely, on the 27th of July, 1883, the defendant's attorneys gave notice of a motion to set aside the
judgment, to be heard on the 28th of August, and annexed to
the notice the affidavits on which they relied. Service of this
notice and of the affidavits was acknowledged by the attorneys
of the plaintiffs without objection. Why the motion was not
argued on the 28th of August is not shown. It was probably
postponed by agreement of the parties, or at the suggestion
of the court. It did not actually take place until May, 1884,
during the continuance of the December special term of 1883.
The district judge certifies that by agreement of counsel and
the consent of the court, it was then heard, together with a
si inilar motion in the case of lForts an d others v. _T7e City of
Matertown, some of the affidavits being used in both cases.
From what appears on the face of the record it is to be presumed that the hearing of the motion was continued by consent, or by direction of the court, from the 28th of August
until the following term, which was the December special
term. The objection, therefore, of want of jurisdiction to set
aside the judgment on account of lapse of time is without
foundation in fact.
As we have stated, the main question is, whether there was
legal service of process on the city. We may dismiss the attempt at service in March, 1873. It was set aside by the court
as not made in the manner prescribed by law so as to give the
court jurisdiction; and the prosecution was dropped by the
plaintiffs. No further steps were taken until after the lapse
of nine years and nine months, when a second effort was made

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

to serve the writ, upon which the present proceedings arose.
It cannot be pretended that the action was pending during
that long period, without further effort to procure a service of
process. The common law provided a remedy in such cases, by
a return of non et inventus, (or what was equivalent thereto,)
and a reissue of the writ from term to term, until a service
could be made, or by process of outlawry. The issue of successive writs kept the suit alive so as to prevent the running
of the statute of limitations. But the making of one spasmodic and unsuccessful effort, and then abandoning the case
for ten years, cannot be regarded as having any such effect, unless aided by some statutory provision. INo such provision has
been cited. There is a provision in the Revised Statutes of
Wisconsin, ยง 4240, which was evidently intended to meet such
a case; but no attempt was made to comply with it. The section referred to is substantially as follows: "An attempt to
commence an action shall be deemed equivalent to commencement thereof . . . when the summons is delivered with
the intent that it shall be actually served; . . . if a corporation organized under the laws of this State be defendant,
to the sheriff or proper officer of the county in which it shall
be established by law, or where its general business is transacted, or where it keeps an office for the transaction of business, or where any officer, attorney, agent or other person
upon whom the summons may by law be served, resides or
has his office; or if such corporation has no'such place of business or any officer or other person upon whom the summons
may by law be served, known to the plaintiff, . . . to the
sheriff or other proper officer of the county in which plaintiff
shall bring his action. But such an attempt must be followed
by the first publication of the summons, or the service .thereof
within sixty days."
As the attempted service of the summons in 1873 can have
no effect upon the solution of the present controversy, the
question then arises whether the attempted service in December, 1882, was a sufficient and legal service. The court below
held that it was not. We have already quoted the return of
the marshal on that occasion. It appears from this return

AMY v. WATERTOWN.

No. 1.

Opinion of the Court.

that he made the attempted service by delivering a copy of
the summons to Win. H. Rohr, the last mayor of the city, a
copy to Henry Bieber, city clerk, a copy to Chas. H. Gardner,
city attorney, and a copy to Thomas Baxter, the last presiding
officer of the board of street commissioners of the city of
Watertown, the office of mayor being vacant and there being
no president of the common council nor presiding officer thereof
in office. Was this such a service upon the city as the law
requires? It clearly was not, unless, by the law of Wisconsin,
the circumstances of the case were such as to dispense with a
literal compliance with the charter. The charter requires service on the mayor of the city. No such service was made.
There was no mayor in office at the time. The last mayor
had resigned, and his resignation had taken effect. Service
on him was of no more avail than service on an entire stranger.
The case is different from those in which we have held that a
resignation of an officer did not take effect until it was accepted
or until another was appointed. In those cases either the common law prevailed or the local law provided for the case and
prevented a vacancy. Such were the cases of Badger v. Bolles,
93 U. S. 599; Edwards v. United States, 103 U. S. 471 ;.-Salamanea v. Wilson, 109 U. S. 627. In Badger v. Bolles the law
of Illinois was in question, and it appeared that by the constitution of that State the officers elected were to hold their offices
until their successors were elected and qualified. In Edwards
v. United States the case arose in Michigan, and it was held
that the common-law rule prevailed there, by which the resignation of a public officer is not complete until the proper
authority accepts it or does something tantamount thereto,
such as appointing a successor. In Salamanca v. Wilson, a
case arising in Kansas, the treasurer of a township moved
across the township line into another township. By the constitution of Kansas, township officers were to hold their offices
one year from their election and until their successors were
qualified, and nothing was said either in the constitution or
laws about residence or non-residence. We held that the
removal did not necessarily vacate the office and that service
of summons on the treasurer was good.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

In the present case, it is true, the consolidated charter of
the city of Watertown provides (chap. 1, sec: 6) that "all
elective officers except aldermen shall, unless otherwise provided, hold their respective offices for one year, and until their
sficcessors are elected and qualified." But that provision has
respect to ordinary cases. It cannot apply in a case of death;
and does not apply in case of resignation; for by chapter 61
of the Private and Local laws of 1867, relating to Watertown
(sec. 1), it is declared that "any city officer who shall resign
his office shall file with the city clerk his resignation in writing, directed to the mayor, and such resignation shall take
effect from the time of filing the same." And by chapter 204
of the Private and Local laws of 1871, relating to Watertown,
it is declared (sec. 2) that "the resignation of the mayor shall
be in writing, directed to the common council or city clerk,
and filed with the city clerk, and shall take effect at the time
of filing the same." These provisions of the statute law are
decisive, and preclude the operation of any such rule as was
recognized in Badger v. Bolles and Edwards v. United States.
The service upon IRohr, the last mayor, therefore, was of no
force, and had no effect whatever. The same thing may be
said of the service on Baxter, the last presiding officer of the
board of street commissioners.
The question then is reduced to this, whether, in case the
mayor has resigned, and there is no presiding officer of the
board of street commissioners, (a body which seems to take
the place of the common council of the city for many "purposes,) service of process on the city clerk, and on a conspicuous
member of the board, is sufficient. If the common law (which
is common reason in matters of justice) were permitted to
prevail there would be no difficulty. In the absence of any
head officer, the court could direct service to be made on such
official persons as it might deem sufficient. But when a statute intervenes and displaces the common law, we axe brought
to a question of words, and are bound to take the words of
the statute as law. The cases are numerous which decide that
where a particular method of serving process is pointed out by
statute, that method must be followed, and the rule is espe-

Valley Ins. Co. v. Fuller, 81 Penn. St. 398. The courts of
Wisconsin strictly adhere to this rule. Congarv. RailroadCo.,
17 Wisconsin, 477, 485; City of Watertown v. Robinson, 59
Wisconsin, 513; City of Watertown v. Robinson, 69 Wisconsin, 230. The two cases last cited related to the charter now
under consideration. In the first case, service was made upon
the city clerk and upon the chairman of the board of street
commissioners whilst the board was in session, in the absence
of the mayor, who could not be found after diligent search.
The court, after referring to the provisions of the charter and
the Revised Statutes on the subject, say: "The question whether
the Revised Statutes control as to the manner of service is not
a material inquiry here, because both the charter and general
provision require the service to be made upon the mayor, but
no service was made upon that officer as appears by the return
of the sheriff. The principle is too elementary to need discussion, that a court can only acquire jurisdiction of a party,
where there is no appearance, by the service of process in the
manner prescribed by law." In the last case (decided in 1887)
service was made in the same manner as in the previous one,
and the court say: "When the statute prescribes a particular
mode of service, that mode must be followed. IRa lex scripta
est. .There is no chance to speculate whether some other mode
will not answer as well. This has been too often held by this
court to require further citations. . . . When the statute
designates a particular officer to whom the process may be
delivered, and with whom it may be left, as service upon the
corporation, no other officer or person can be substituted in
his place. The designation of one particular officer upon whom
service may be made excludes all others. The temporary inconvenience arising from a vacancy in the office of mayor
affords no good reason for a substitution of some other officer

OCTOBER TERi, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

in his place, upon whom service could be made, by unwarrantable construction not contemplated by the statute."
It is unnecessary to look farther to see what the law of
Wisconsin is on this subject. It is perfectly clear that by that
law the service of process in the present case was ineffective
and void.
The counsel for the plaintiff in error endeavor to avoid this
conclusion by referring to the act of 1879, which declares that
"the board of street commissioners of said city, and the chairman of said board, shall have concurrent power with the
mayor and common council of said city, in the appointment
of inspectors and clerks of election, and shall have all other
powers conferred, by law, upon said mayor and common council, subject to the control of said common council, except the
power of levying taxes." It is contended that this act gives
to the chairman of the board of street commissioners the same
power as the mayor has to receive service of process against
the city. But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, as we have
seen, has expressly decided otherwise. And the language of
the act of 1879 is not that the chairman of the board shall have
the power of the mayor, but that the board and the chairman
shall have concurrent power with the mayor and common council, - evidently referring to the power of the body, not to
the separate power of the officers. Besides, if it were conceded
that the chairman of the board had the same power as the
mayor, Baxter, who was served with process as chairman of
the board, was not permanent chairman, but was only temporary chairman of the particular meeting, and ceased to have
any official position as such after the meeting adjourned. He
was in no sense chairman of the board at the time when he
was served with process. This fact, however, does not seem
material in the view of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin; for
in the cases before it, the chairman of the board was served
with process during its actual session and whilst he was presiding. In the construction of a state statute, in a matter purely
domestic, (as this is,) we always feel strongly disposed to give
great weight to the decisions of the highest tribunal of the
State.

AMY v. WATERTOWN.

No. 1.

Opinion of the Court.

There is a question entirely outside of the one which we have
been discussing; it is, whether the state law, as thus ascertained,
is objectionable on the score of being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. Does it impose embarrassments
in the way of the creditor in pursuit of his claim, which did
not exist when his debt was created? The point is not distinctly made by the counsel of the plaintiffs in error, although
it is hinted at in their brief. But no statute has been pointed
out to us, showing any change in the law of the State in this
regard. As the record stands, we have no sufficient ground
for discussing the question in the present case.
With motives we have nothing to do. Certainly, improper
motives cannot be attributed to a state legislature in the passage of any laws for the government of the State. Individuals
may be actuated by improper motives, and may take advantage
of defects and imperfections of the law for the purpose of
defeating justice. The mayor of Watertown may have been
actuated by such a motive in resigning his office immediately
after being inducted into it. But he had a legal right to resign; and if the plaintiffs are prejudiced by his action, it is
darinum absque injuria. The plaintiffs are in no worse case
than were the creditors of the city of Memphis after the repeal
of its charter and the establishment of a taxing district in its
stead. The State has plenary power over its municipal corporations, to change their organization, to modify their method
of internal government, or to abolish them altogether. Contracts entered into with them by private parties cannot deprive
the, State of this paramount authority. See M[eriwether v.
Garrett,102 U. S. 472.
The cases of Broughton v. Pensacola, 93 U. S. 266, and
Mobile v. Watson, 116 U. S. 289, cannot aid the plaintiffs in
this case. Those were cases in which a new name was given
to an old corporation, or a new corporation was made out of
an old one, - that was the substance of it - and the question

was whether the new corporation, or the old corporation by its
new name, was liable for the old debts; and we held that it
was. That was a question of liability, not a question of procedure. There the way was open for looking into the actual

relations of the old and new corporations, and deciding according to the justice of the case. Here we are bound by statute;
and not by the state statute alone, but by the act of Congress,
which obliges us to follow the state statute and state practice.
The Federal courts are bound hand and foot, and are compelled and obliged by the Federal legislature to obey the state
law; and according to this law the judgment of the Circuit
Court was correct and is, therefore,
Affrmed.

Decided April 8, 1889.

The general rule respecting statutes of limitation is that the language of
the act must prevail, and that no reason based on apparent inconvenience

or hardship will justify a departure from it.
Cases considered in which courts of equity and some courts of law have held
that the running of the statute was suspended on the ground of fraud.
Cases considered in which courts of law have held the operation of the
statute suspended for want of parties, or because the law prohibits the

Inability to serve process upon a defendant, caused by his designed elusion
of it, is no excuse for not commencing an action within the prescribed
period.
