Statement of the Case.

BOTILLER v. DOMINGUEZ.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:
No. 1370. Submitted January 7, 1889.-

Decided April 1, 1889.

If an act of Congress is in conflict with a treaty of the United States
with a Foreign Power, this court is bound to follow the statutory enactments of its own government.
No title to land in California, dependent upon Spanish or Mexican grants,
can be of any validity, which has not been submitted to, and confirmed
by, the board provided for that purpose under the act of March 3, 1851,
9 Stat. 631; or, if rejected by that board, confirmed by the District Court.
or by the Supreme Court of the United States.

THE case which raised the federal question was stated by
the court in its opinion as follows:

This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of
California.
The action was in the nature of ejectment, brought in the
Superior Court of the county of Los Angeles by Dominga
Dominguez against Brigido Botiller and others, to recover
possession of a tract of land situated in said county, known as
Rancho Las Virgenes. The title of the plaintiff was a grant,
claimed to have been made by the government of Mexico to
Nemecio Dominguez and Domingo Carrillo on the first day of
October, 1834; but no claim under this grant had ever been
presented for confirmation to the board of land commissioners
appointed under the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat.
631, "to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the
State of California," and no patent had ever issued from the
United States to any one for the land or for any part of it.
It appeared that the defendants, Botiller and others, prior
to the commencement of the action, had settled upon and
severally were in the occupancy of the respective parcels or
tracts of land claimed by them, and had improved and cultivated the same, and were in the possession thereof, with the pur-

Argument for Defendant in Error.

pose and intention of holding and improving the several tracts
of land so severally held, as preemption or homestead settlers,
claiming the same to be public lands of the United States. It
was shown that they were competent and proper persons to
make preemptions or homestead claims, and that the land in
controversy was within the territorial limits of the so-called
Rancho Las Virgenes.
On this state of facts the judge of the inferior court instructed the jury as follows:
"First. It is made my duty to construe the written instruments received in evidence in this case and to declare their
legal effect. I therefore instruct you that the documents,
Plaintiff's Exhibits A and B, and the acts evidenced thereby
under the Mexican law in force at the time they were made,
constituted a perfect grant and operated to vest in the grantees
therein named all the right, title and interest of the Mexican
government. They vested as much title under the laws of
Mexico in the grantee as does a patent from the United States
to the patentee under our system of government.
"Second. The title to the land by grant from Mexico,
being perfect at the time of the acquisition of California by
the United States, the grantee was not compelled to submit
the same for confirmation to the board of commissioners established by the act of Congress of March 3d, 1851, nor did the
grantee, Nemecio Dominguez, forfeit the land described in the
grant by a failure to present his claim for confirmation before
said board of commissioners, and the title so acquired by the
grantee may be asserted by him or his successor in interest in
the courts of this country."
To this ruling and instruction the defendants excepted.
Judgment was rendered for plaintiff, which was affirmed by
the Supreme Court of the State of California, and to that
judgment this writ of error is directed.

sioners under the act of 1851. This proposition would seem to
be fully settled in the Supreme Court of the State in Minturn
v. Brower, 24 Cal. 644. The decision in that case is mentioned with approval in Stevenson v. Bennett, 35 Cal. 424, 431;
Steinbach v. Moore, 30 Cal. 499, 507; Seale v. Ford,29. Cal.
104, 107; Banks v. .loreno, 39 Cal. 233, 237.
The case of iinturn v. Brower was very carefully, thoroughly and elaborately considered by the court; and the doctrine there laid down that it was not the intent of the act of
March 3d, 1851, for the settlement of private land claims in
California, to require persons holding perfect titles to lands in
California to present them to the land commission provided
for bythat act for confirmation; and that the holders of such
titles could not be required to present them for confirmation,
under the penalty of forfeiture of their titles for failure so to
present them, would seem to be sustainable upon well-recognized principles of constitutional law. Those principles have
often been stated by this court in cases involving questions of
title derived from foreign governments; and have sometimes
been applied by the court to cases presenting features similar
to those in this case. We will hereafter refer to some of those
cases.
We think that there would never have been any doubt upon
this question, were it not for certain dicta in .Fremontv. United
States, 17 How. 542; United States v. Fossatt, 21 How. 445;
and X2ore v. Steinbach, 127 U. S. 70, to the effect that the act
of 1851 required the holders of all titles derived from the
Spanish or Mexican Governments, whether perfect or imperfect, to present them to the.land commission for confirmation; that the requirement of the act extended not only to
the holders.of equitable, inchoate or imperfect titles, but also
to the holders of perfect titles.
This court in United States v. .Moreno, 1 Wall. 400, and
Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478, and the Supreme Court of the
State in Estrada v. Murphy, 19 Cal. 248, carefully save perfect titles from the construction given in those cases to the act
di 1851, holding only that the act required the presentation to
the land commission, of imperfect titles - such titles as were
involved in those cases.

BOTILLER v. DOMINGUEZ.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo preserved the rights of
property then held by Mexican citizens in the ceded territory.
This placed them on the same footing as citizens of the United
States. See United States v. Perceman,7 Pet. 51; United
States v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 436, 465; United States v. Wiggins,
14 Pet. 334, 349; United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691;

v. Reynes, 9 How. 127, 144; Dent v. .Emmeger, 14 Wall.
308, as to titles under the cessions of Florida and Louisiana,
where a like doctrine has been held.
Congress had no power, under the Constitution, to require
the presentation of perfect titles to the board of land commissioners, under the penalty of forfeiture of the land.
This point was not presented in .Minturn v. Brower, ubi
supra, at least, not in the form now attempted. The State,
upon its admission into the Union, succeeded -as was said of
Alabama- to all the rights of sovereignty, jurisdiction and
eminent domain. Pollardv. Hagan, 3 How. 212.
The State has all the powers pertaining to sovereignty, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States. All
persons and property were subject to its dominion. It has
authority to provide for the acquisition, tenure and transmission of titles to property. It regulates domestic relations,
trusts, agencies and the like. It possesses the right of eminent
domain, and all escheats vest in the State. The State has the
ultimate jurisdiction over persons and things, except as limited
by the Constitution of the United States.
ew York v. Miller,
11 Pet. 185.
The Colonization Law of 1824, and the Regulations of 1828,
were, after their adoption, and until superseded by the treaty
of cession, the only laws in force regarding the granting of
public lands in California. United States v. Vallejo, 1 Black,
541 ; United States v. WTorkman, 1 Wall. 745 ; United States
v. Osio, 23 How. 273.
Those laws provided the means for the acquisition of the
entire andperfect title by the persons who should petition for
grants of lands.
The court will take judicial notice of the laws of Mexico reVOL. cxxx-16

lating to the granting of public lands. UnitedStates v. Turner,
11 How. 663; .Fremontv. United States, 17 How. 542; United
States v. Perot, 98 U. S. 428; Payne v. Treadwell, 16 Cal. 221.
And they will take notice of those laws, as they would of a
state law of California for the sale of the public lands of the
State, and under which lands have been sold, but which was
afterwards repealed, upon the adoption of a new law upon the
same subject.
It must be remembered that the United States is and stands,
in respect to its lands, as a private proprietor, except that it is
not subject to state taxation, or the Statutes of Limitation, or
the statutes regarding conveyances, and enjoys perhaps some
other immunities. If Congress can forfeit our lands twenty
years after our title became perfect, we cannot perceive why
it cannot provide for another forfeiture twenty years after the
issue of the patent under the act of 1851 ; that is to say, unless
for some undiscovered reason, the title issued by the United
States is better entitled to protection than one issued by the
predecessor or grantor of the United States. It is said in
Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, that a State cannot annul her
grant of lands. -It is equally clear that she cannot annul a
grant made by her predecessor. It is also clear that the United
States cannot annul a grant, valid when made, whether made
by the State or its predecessor. The claim of such a power is
repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.
MR.

JUSTICE MILLEE

delivered the opinion of the court.

The principal error assigned, and the only one necessary to
be considered here, is in the following language:
"The court erred in holding that under the said act of Congress of March 3d, 1851, it was not necessary for each and
every person claiming lands in California, by virtue of any
right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments, to present such claim to the board of land commissioners under said act."
The question presented is an important one in reference to
land titles in the State of California, and is entitled to our

BOTILLER v. DOMKINGUEZ.
Opinion of the Court.

serious consideration. Although it has been generally supposed that nearly all the private claims to any of the lands
acquired by the United States from Mexico, by the treaty of
peace made at the close of the Mexican war, have been presented to and passed upon by the board of commissioners
appointed for that purpose by the act of 1851, yet claims are now
often brought forward which have not been so passed upon by
that board, and were never presented to it for consideration.
And if the proposition on which the Supreme Court of California decided this case is a sound one, namely, that the board
constituted under that act had no jurisdiction of, and could
not by their decree affect in any manner, a title which had
been perfected under the laws of the Mexican government
prior to the transfer of the country to the United States, it is
impossible to tell to what extent such claims of perfected titles
may be presented, even in cases where the property itself has
by somebody else been brought before that board and passed
upon.
The proposition seems to-have been occasionally the subject
of comment in the Supreme Court of California in the early
days, after the land commission had ceased to exist, and it has
also been frequently considered in decisions of this court of
the same period. It is urged very forcibly by counsel for the
plaintiff in error that this court has fully decided against it in
several well considered cases, and that previous to the case of
.Xinturn v. Brower, 24 Cal. 644, the decisions, or at least the
intimations, of the Supreme Court of California were also
against the doctrine.
By the treaty of peace, known as that of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
of February 2, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, which closed the controversies
and the war between the United States and Mexico, a cession
was made of a very large territory by the government of
Mexico to the government of the United States. This was a
transfer of the political dominion and of the proprietary interest in this land, but the government of Mexico caused to be
inserted in the instrument certain provisions intended for the
protection of private property owned by Mexicans within this
territory at the time the treaty was made; and it may be con-

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

ceded that the obligation of the United States to give such
protection, both by this treaty and by the law of nations, was
perfect.
That portion of this territory which afterwards became a
part of the United States under the designation of the State of
California had been taken possession of during the war, in the
year 1846. Most of it was in a wild state of nature, with very
few resident white persons, and very little land cultivated
within its limits. Article 11 of the treaty describes it in the
following language:
"Considering that a great part of the territories which, by
the present treaty, are to be comprehended for the future
within the limits of the United States, is now occupied by
savage tribes, who will hereafter be under the exclusive control of the government of the United States, and whose incursions within the territory of Mexico would be prejudicial in
the extreme, it is solemnly agreed that all such incursions
shall be forcibly restrained by the government of the United
States, whensoever this may be necessary."
This extract from the treaty shows the character of the
country which was acquired by the United States under that
instrument.
Very soon after the American army took possession of
California in 1846, it was discovered that rich mines of the
precious metals were abundant in that country, and a rush of
emigration almost unparalleled in history to that region commenced, which was continued from that time on for many
years. It was in this condition, as to population, of the
territory itself, with a proprietary title in the United States
to a vast region of country included within its limits, in which
miners, ranchmen, settlers under the Mexican church authorities and claimants under Mexican grants were widely scattered, that the State of California was admitted into the
Union, and the necessity was presented for ascertaining by
some means the validity of the claims of private individuals
within its boundaries, and to establish them as distinct from
the lands which belonged to the government. To this end
Congress passed a statute on the 3d day of March, 1851, en-

BOTILLER v. DOMINGUEZ.
Opinion of the Court.

titled "An act to ascertain and settle the private land claims
in the State of California." 9 Stat. 631. The first section of
that statute reads as follows:
"SEc. 1. That for the purpose of ascertaining and settling
private land claims in the State of California, a commission
shall be, and is hereby, constituted, which shall consist of three
commissioners, to be appointed by the President of the United
States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
which commission shall continue for three years from the
date of this act, unless sooner discontinued by the President of
the United States."
Several of the succeeding sections are devoted to providing
for officers, declaring their duties, directing the mode of taking
depositions and regulating the sessions of the commissioners,
the administration of oaths, and other matters. The eighth
section is as follows:
"SEc. 8. That each and every person claiming lands in California by virtue of any right or title derivedfrom the Spanish
or -Mexicangovernment shall present the same to the said commissioners when sitting as a board, together with such documentary evidence and testimony of witnesses as the said
claimant relies upon in support of such claims; and it shall
be the duty of the commissioners, when the case is ready for
hearing, to proceed promptly to examine the same upon such
evidence, and upon the evidence produced in behalf of the
United States, and to decide upon the validity of the said
claim, and, within thirty days after such decision is rendered,
to certify the same, with the reasons on which it is founded,
to the district attorney of the United States in and for the
district in which such decision shall be rendered."
The ninth and tenth sections provide for appeals by the
claimant and by the government from the decisions of this
commission, first to the District Court of the United States
within that district, and from thence to this court.
The eleventh section, prescribing the rule by which the
commissioners shall decide these cases, is as follows:
"SEc. 11. That the commissioners herein provided for, and
the District and Supreme Courts, in deciding on the validity

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

of any claim brought by them under the provisions of this
act, shall be governed by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
the law of nations, the laws, usages and customs of the government from which the claim is derived, the principles of
equity, and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United
States, so far as they are applicable."
Section 13 declares:
"That all lands, the claims to which have been finally rejected by the commissioners in manner herein provided, or
which shall be finally decided to be invalid by the District
or Supreme Court, and all lands the claims to which shall not
have been_ resented to the said commissioners within two years
after the date of this act, shall be deemed, held and considered
as part of the public do main of the United States; and for
all claims finally confirmed by the said commissioners, or by
the said District or Supreme Court, a patent sholl issue to the
claimant upon his presenting to the general land office an
authentic certificate of such confirmation, and a plat or survey
of the said land, duly certified and approved by the surveyor
general of California, whose duty it shall be' to cause all
private claims which shall be finally confirmed to be accurately surveyed, and to furnish plats of the same," etc.
"Sxo. 15. That the final decrees rendered by the said commissioners, or by the District or Supreme Court of the United
States, or any patent to be issued under this act, shall be conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only,
and shall not affect the interests of third persons."
Two propositions under this statute are presented by counsel
in support of the decision of the Supreme Court of California.
The first of these is, that the statute itself is invalid, as being
in conflict with the provisions of the treaty with Mexico, and
violating the protection which was. guaranteed by it to the
property of Mexican citizens, owned by them at the date of
the treaty; and also in conflict with the rights of property
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, so far
as it may affect titles perfected under Mexico. The second
proposition is, that the statute was not intended to apply to
claims which were supported by a complete and perfect title

BOTILLER v. DOMINGUEZ.
Opinion of the Court.

from the Mexican government, but, on the contrary, only to
such as were imperfect, inchoate and equitable in their character, without being a strict legal title.
With regard to the first of these propositions it may be said,
that so far as the act of Congress is in conflict with the treaty
with Mexico, that is a matter in which the court is bound to follow the statutory enactments of its own government. If the
treaty was violated by this general statute enacted for the
purpose of ascertaining the validity of claims derived from the
Mexican government, it was a matter of international concern,
which the two States must determine by treaty, or by such other
means as enables one State to enforce upon another the obligations of a treaty. This court, in a class of cases like the
present, has no power to set itself up as the instrumentality
for enforcing the provisions of a treaty with a foreign nation
which the government of the United States, as a sovereign
power, chooses to disregard. -TheCherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall.
616; Taylor v. .2uorton, 2 Curtis, 454; Head 3ioney Cases, 112
U. S. 580, 598; Fhitney v. R2obertson, 124 U. S. 190, 195.
The more important question, however, is- does the statute,
in its provisions for the establishment and ascertainment of
private land claims in that country which was derived from
Mexico, apply to such as were perfected according to the processes and laws of Mexico at the time the treaty was entered
into? or is it limited to those imperfect and inchoate claims
where the initiation of the proceedings necessary to secure a
legal right and title to the property had been commenced but
had not been completed ?
There is nothing in the language of the statute to imply any
such exclusion of perfected claims from the jurisdiction of the
commission. The title of the act, so far as it can be relied on,
repels any such distinction; it is "to ascertain and settle the
private land claims in the State of California;" and the first
section, above quoted, uses the same terms. "That for the
purpose of ascertaining and settling private land claims in the
State of California, a commission shall be, and is hereby, constituted," etc. The eighth section, which prescribes the functions of the court and its duties says: "That each and every

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

person claiming lands in California by virtue of any 'ight or
title derived from tw Spanish or Xfexican government, shall
present the same to the said commissioners when sitting as a
board, . .
and it shall be the duty of the commissioners,
when the case is ready for hearing, to proceed promptly to
examine the same," etc.
In all this there is no hint or attempt at any distinction, as
to the claims to be presented, between those which are perfect
and those which are imperfect in their character. On the contrary, the language of the eighth section is as precise and
comprehensive as it could well .be made, in that it includes
every person claiming lands in California "by virtue of any
right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican government."
The fifteenth section declares that the final decrees rendered
in such cases, or any patent issued under the act, "shall be conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only ;"
that is to say, it shall be conclusive on the United States and
on the claimants, but it shall not conclude the rights of anybody else, if in a position to contest the action of the board.
It is not possible, therefore, from the language of this statute, to infer that there was in the minds of its framers any distinction as to the jurisdiction they were conferring upon this
board, between claims derived from the Spanish or Mexican
government, which were perfect under the laws of those governments, and those which were incipient, imperfect, or inchoate.
Undoubtedly, under the powers which these commissioners
had to examine into the existing claims, there would be a
difference in the principles of decision which they would apply, as to their validity, between a perfected title under the
Mexican government and one which was merely incipient, and
which the board might reject as unworthy of confirmation for
many reasons. Of this the statute takes no note, except that
it provides that the principles on which the commissioners are
to act shall be those mentioned in the eleventh section, above
quoted.
Nor is there any reason, in the policy upon which the stat-

BOTILLER v. DOILNGUEZ.
Opinion of the Court.

ute is founded and the purposes it was intended to subserve,
why this distinction should be made. Obviously it was not
intended to adjust or settle titles between private citizens making claim to the same lands. It is equally clear that the main
purpose of the statute was to separate and distinguish the
lands which the United States owned as property, which could
be sold to others, either absolutely or by permitting them to
settle thereon with preimption rights, or which could be re
served from public sale entirely, from those lands which belonged, either equitably or legally, to private parties under a
claim of right derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments.
When this was done the aim of the statute was attained.
The order of the commissioners or the decree of the court
established as between the United States and the private citizen the validity or the invalidity of such claims, and enabled
the government of the United States, out of all its vast domain, to say "this is my property," and also enabled the claimant under the Mexican government who had a just claim,
whether legal or equitable, to say "this is mine." This was
the purpose of the statute; and it was equally important to
the object which the United States had in the passage of it,
that claims under perfect grants from the Mexican government should be established as that imperfect claims should be
established or rejected.
The superior force which is attached, in the argument of
counsel, to a perfect grant from the Mexican government bad
its just influence in the board of commissioners, or in the courts
to which their decisions could be carried by appeal. If the
title was perfect, it would there be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, holding that the claim thus presented was
valid; if it was not, then it was the right and the duty of that
court to determine whether it was such a claim as the United
States was bound to respect, even though it was not perfect as
to all the forms and proceedings under which it was derived.
So that the superior value of a perfected Mexican claim had
the same influence in a court of justice which is now set up
for it in an action where the title is contested.

OCTOBER TERMT, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Nor can it be said that there is anything unjust or oppressive in requiring the owner of a valid claim, in that vast wilderness of lands unclaimed, and unjustly claimed, to present his
demand to a tribunal possessing all the elements of judicial
functions, with a guarantee of judicial proceedings, so that his
title could be established if it was found to be valid, or rejected
if it was invalid.
We are unable to see any injustice, any want of constitutional power, or any violation of the treaty, in the means by
which the United States undertook to separate the lands in
which it held the proprietary interest from those which belonged, either equitably or by a strict legal title, to private
persons.

Every person owning land or other property is at

all times liable to be called into a court of justice to contest
his title to it. This may be done by another individual, or by
the government under which he lives. It is a necessary part
of a free government, in which all are equally subject to the
laws, that whoever asserts rights or exercises powers over property may be called before the proper tribunals to sustain them.
:No doubt could exist, and none whatever would have been
suggested, if this statute, instead of requiring the individual
claimants to take notice that they were called upon to establish their title and to come forward and do so, had provided
that the United States should sue everybody who was found
in possession of any land in California at the. time the treaty
was made, and thus compel him to produce his title, if he had
any. Such suits would have been sustained without hesitation,
as being legal, constitutional and according to right. What
difference can it make, then, that the party who is supposed
to possess all the evidences which exist to support his claim is
called upon to come before a similar tribunal and establish it
by a judicial proceeding? It is beyond question that the latter
mode is the more appropriate one to carry out the object intended, and better calculated to sa-e time and expense, both
to the government and to the party, and to arrive at safe and
satisfactory conclusions.
The government of the United States, when it came to flie
consideration of this statute, was not without large expe
e

BOTILLER v. DOMINGUEZ.
Opinion of the Court.

in a somewhat similar class of cases arising under the treaties
for the purchase of Florida from Spain and of the Territory
of Louisiana from France. In the latter case, particularly, a
very much larger number of claims by private individuals existed to the soil acquired by the treaty, some of whom resided
on the land which they claimed, while others did not; and the
titles asserted were as diverse in their nature as those arising
under the cession from Mexico. The Territory of Louisiana
was held for many years by Spain, then by France, and the
mode of acquiring rights, claims and titles to the public lands
had been pursued according to the forms prescribed by those
two governments, so that, upon its transfer to the United
States, Congress was engaged for a long series of years in the
business of establishing the valid claims and rejecting those
which were invalid. There were in those cases many titles
which had been perfected under the Spanish and French laws,
as well as those which were in the most incipient stage of the
assertion of rights.
It is tot profitable perhaps to go into the details of the
various acts of Congress passed upon the subject, most of
which were enacted in the interest of private claimants, and
many of which were designed to remove the bar which had
come to exist by reason of delays and failures to comply with
the statutes in regard to the presentation of such claims. Congress appointed commissioners to investigate claims, who were
to I-eport to that body, and generally reserved the right of
rejecting or confirming those reports. They changed the
forn and the number of these officers, the rules by which
they should be guided, and the times limited for the assertion
of private land claims; indeed, it is almost safe to say that
some legislation may still be wanting, and may still be had,
to do justice to unfortunate parties who have thus far not
obtained the advantages of establishing their rights.
The wisdom, therefore, of the present act in regard to the
land claims in California is manifest by a comparison with
those earlier statutes in which Congress undertook to do the
same thing which it desired to do in the act of 1851, but which
failed for want of a clear, satisfactory and simple mode of

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

doing it, by bringing all the parties before a tribunal essentially judicial in its character, whose decisions should be final
without further reference to Congress. But to have the benefit of the superiority of the plan of 1851 over former modes
of establishing private rights to lands acquired by treaty, the
later statute must be carried out in accordance with the intention found in its provisions.
This view has, we think, been established and prevailed
without limitation or contradiction in the decisions of this
court from the earliest period when it could be raised here
under the statute. In the case of ]A'emont v. United States,
17 How. 542, 553,. the Supreme Court, in the opinion delivered
by Chief Justice Taney, said:
"It will be seen from the quotation we have made, that the
8th section embraces not only inchoate or equitable titles, but
legal titles also; and requires them all to undergo examination
and to be passed upon by the court. The object of this provision appears to be, to place the titles to land in California
upon a stable foundation, and to give the parties who possess
them an opportunity of placing them on the records of the
country, in a manner and form that will prevent future
controversy.
"In this respect it differs from the act of 1824, under which
the claims in Louisiana and Florida were decided. The jurisdiction of the court, in these cases, was confined to inchoate
equitable titles, which required some other act of the government to vest in the party the legal title or full ownership. If
he claimed to have obtained from either of the former governments a full and perfect title, he was left to assert it in the
ordinary forms of law, upon the documents under which he
claimed. The court had no power to sanction or confirm it
when proceeding under the act of 1824, or the subsequent
laws extending its provisions."
In the subsequent case of United States v. Fossatt, 21 How.
44:5, 447, this proposition is repeated in the most emphatic language, as follows:
"The matter submitted by Congress to the inquiry and
determination of the board of commissioners by the act of

the 3d of March, 1851, (9 Stat. 632, § 8,) and to the courts of
the United States on appeal, by that act and the act of 31st
August, 1852, (10 Stat. 99, § 12,) are the claims 'of each and
every person in California, by virtue of any right or title
derived from the Spanish or Mexican government.' And it
will be at once understood that these comprehend all private
claims to land in California.
"The effect of the inquiry and decision of these tribunals
upon the matter submitted is final and conclusive. If unfavorable to the claimant, the land 'shall be deemed, held and considered as a part of the public domain of the United States;'
but if favorable, the decrees rendered by the -commissioners or
the courts ' shall be conclusive between the United States and
the claimants.'
"These acts of Congress do not create a voluntary jurisdiction, that the claimant may seek or decline. All claims to
land that are withheld from the board of commissioners during the legal term for presentation, are treated as non-existent,
and the land as belonging to the public domain."
In the case of United.States v.. Catillero, 2 Black, 17; -158,
it was said:
"Power to decide upon the validity of any claim presented
to land in California, by virtue of any right or title derived
from the Spanish or Mexican government, as matter of original jurisdiction, is, by the act of the 3d of March, 1851, exclusively conferred upon the commissioners appointed under the
first section of that act."
In the case of NYewhall v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761, 764, it was
said, in speaking of the statute of 1851, that "claims, whether
grounded upon an inchoate or a perfected title, were to be ascertained and adequately protected."
We will only refer to one other case, that of .Mfore v. Steinbaci, 127 U. S. 70, 81, decided at the last term, where the
whole subject was carefully reviewed in the opinion of Mr.
Justice Field. In regard to the question now before us the
court in that opinion said:
"It follows from what is thus said that it would be a sufficient answer to the conteutloh of -the defendants, that the

grant under which they claim to have acquired a perfect title
conferred none. The grantees were not invested with such
title, and could not be, without an official delivery of possession under the Mexican government, and such delivery was
not had, and could not be had, after the cession of the country, except by American authorities acting under a law of
Congress. But independently of this consideration, and assuming that the title under the grant was perfect, the obligation of the grantee was none the less to present his claim to
the board of land commissioners for examination. The ascertainment of existing claims was a matter of vital importance
to the government in the execution of its policy respecting
tle public lands; and Congress might well declare that a failure to present a claim should be deemed an abandonment of
it, and that the lands covered by it should be considered a
part of the public domain."
It is said by counsel for defendant in error that there would
never have been any doubt upon this question were it not for
certain dicta in the cases here referred to. We are unable to
perceive any sufficient reason for calling these expressions of
the court, whose judgment must be final on the subject,
"dicta," for we feel bound to say, that they were observations pertinent to the matter under consideration, and seem to
have met the entire approbation of the court in whose behalf
they were uttered; and as they embraced a very considerable
period of time, during which a contrary opinion would have
saved much labor to the court, we must believe that the opinions thus expressed without variation were the well-considered
views of this court when they were delivered.
A cn reful examination of the decisions of the Supreme Court
of California on this subject will show that if they do not absolutely support this view, they contain nothing contrary to it,
until the case of fJinturn v. Brower, 24 Cal. 644. That court,
in the case of Teschemacher v. Thompson, 18 Cal. 11, said:

"By the act of March 3, 1851, the government has afforded
the means of protecting all titles, legal or equitable, acquired
previous to the cession.

Its power to thus provide . . . results

Opinion of the Court.

ters connected with the treaty and the enforcement of the
obligations incurred thereunder. . . . It must determine
for itself what claims to property existed at the date of the
treaty."
And so in Semple v. Riagar, 27 Cal. 163, shortly after the
decision of -Minturnv. Brower, suvra, the court used the following language:
"The court will take judicial notice that, according to the
provisions of the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, every person.claiming lands in California, by virtue of any right or
title derived from the Spanish or Mexican government, should
present his petition for the confirmation of his title to the
board of land commissioners, and that such proceedings must
be had thereupon, before said board or the District or Supreme
Court of the United States, that a final decree confirming the
title of the claimant to the land must be entered before the
patent for the land could be issued. A patent 'could not be
issued for the land claimed under a Mexican grant, unless such
proceedings were first had for the confirmation; and it is not
pretended that they were not had in respect to the Jimeno
grant. The patent was issued only in pursuance of the decree
of confirmation, and for the purpose of carrying it into effect."
These cases show that the doctrine has not been considered
as well settled in California against the views herein expressed
until the case now before us, or rather until that of Phelan v.
Poyoreno, 74 Cal. 448, was decided, which is referred to by
the court as the foundation, of its judgment in the present
action. That case was argued before a commission of the
Supreme Court, whose judgment was adopted by the Supreme
Court of the State, under a law of California which prescribes
this mode of appellate jurisdiction.
Upon the mere question of authority these decisions of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and of the Supreme
Court of California, would be decisive against the judgment
of the latter court in this case. But we are quite satisfied
that upon principle, as we ha re attempted to show, there can
be no doubt of the proposition, that no title to land in California, dependent upon Spanish or Mexican grants can be of any

validity which has not been submitted to and confirmed by
the board provided for that purpose in the act of 1851; or, if
rejected by that board, confirmed by the District or Supreme
Court of the United States.
This proposition requires that the judgment of the Supreme
Court of California in the case before us be
Reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further
proceedings in conformity with thds opinion.

PARLEY'S PARK SILVER MINING COMPANY v.
KERR.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF UTAH.
No. 154. Submitted January 8, 1889. -Decided

April 1, 1889.

In Utah a complaint which alleges that the plaintiff is owner and in pdssession of land, that the defendant claims an adverse interest or estate
therein, that such claim is without legal or equitable foundation and is
void, and that it is a cloud on the plaintiff's title and embarrasses him
in the use and disposition of his property and depreciates his property,
and which prays for equitable relief in these respects, is sufficient to require the adverse claim on the part of the defendant to be set up,
inquired into and judicially determined, and the question of title finally
settled.
The question, under Rev. Stat. § 2319, as to what customs and rules of miners in a mining district not inconsistent with the laws of the United
States are in force in the district when an application is made for a patent of mineral land, is one of fact determinable by the Commissioner of
the Laud Office.
Rule 4 of the rules of the Blue Ledge mining district in Utah, adopted May
17, 1870, limiting the width of a mining location to 200 feet, was so modified May 4, 1872, that thereafter the surface width was to be governed
by the laws of the United States.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. J. G. Sutherland and Mr. J. R. McBride for appellant.

Mr. Charles W. Bennett for appellee.
