Statement of the Case.

RIOHARDSON v. GREEN.
NELSON v. GREEN.
NELSON v. GREEN.
SIOKLES v. GREEN.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COIRT OF THE UNITED
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.

STATES FOR

Argued February 1, 4, 1889.-Decided March 18, 1889.

It is a well settled rule that this court will not entertain an appeal where
the transcript of the record is not filed in this court at the term next
succeeding the taking of the appeal, unless a recognized satisfactory
excuse for the laches is made.
It is not a sufficient excuse that the clerk of the court below was mistaken
in his understanding as to the time when the transcript must be filed, and
that it was prepared as soon as possible by him, having due regard to the
other duties of his office, and the size of the record.
Where the transcript of the record was placed in the hands of the clerk of
this court at the next term after the appeal was allowed and perfected by
the filing of a bond, but no appearance was entered for the appellant, nor
any deposit for costs made, at that term, but these things were done at
the next following term, and the case was then docketed, and a motion
to dismiss the appeal was made at the third term thereafter: Held, that
the motion must be denied.
Where an appeal is allowed in open court at the same term the decree is
made yet if the bond to perfect the appeal is not accepted at or during
that term, a citation is necessary.
The issuing of a citation may be waived by the appellee, and a general
appearance by him is a waiver of a citation.
Where this court has jurisdiction of an appeal, and a citation is necessary,
it will issue one.
Reasons stated why the appeal in this case is not open to the objection that
it does not involve more than $ 5000, or to the objection that the appellee
is not named in the order allowing the appeal.
Where the appellee died after the argument of the motion to dismiss the
appeal, the order on the motion was entered nunc pro tune as of the day
of the argument.

IN Equrry. On the 21st January, 1889, a motion to dismiss
these cases was submitted, and a further motion was made to

postpone the hearing when the cases should be reached, until
the motion to dismiss should be decided. The motion to postpone was denied on the 22d January, and the motion to dismiss was ordered to be heard at the argument on the merits.

Mr. JuSTIOn BLATOMFoRD delivered the opinion of the court.
These are five appeals taken in a suit in equity brought by
Ashbel Green and William Bond, trustees, against the Chicago,
Saginaw and Canada Railroad Company, in the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Western District of Michigan, for
the foreclosure of a mortgage executed to the plaintiffs upon
the railroad of that company. The mortgage was given to
the plaintiffs, as trustees, to secure 5500 bonds, of $1000 each,
issued by the company, and payable to the plaintiffs or bearer.
A decree was made, on June 30, 1882, directing a foreclosure
and sale, and referring it to a master to determine the priority
of those who claimed to be creditors of the company. On the
6th of November, 1882, the master filed his report, in which
he divided the debts and bonds proved before him into four
classes. In class A he placed the debts which had a priority
over the bonds. The creditors in class A were Thomas M.

RICHARDSON v. GREEN.
Opinion of the' Court,

Nelson and James B. Soule, for a debt of $25,284.17, of which
$12,497.48 had a priority, and was to be paid in full; and
Thomas M. Nelson for a debt of $7749.42, of which $3845.20
had a priority, and was to be paid in full. In class B he
placed the bona Aile holders of the bonds as purchasers of
them, among whom were Daniel E. Sicldes for 163 bonds,
amounting to $269,541.26; and Benjamin F. Stevens, for 32
bonds, amounting to $51,247.20. In class 0 he placed persons
who held the bonds as collateral security, and the amount of
security so held. Among these was Benjamin Richardson,
with a debt of $273,282.87, and collateral security in 200
bonds, amounting to $374,904.
After a hearing on the report of the master, and exceptions
thereto, the court, on the 3d of :May, 1883, made a decree providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the
mortgaged property which had taken place. After directing
the payment of certain expenses and of receiver's certificates,
it directed the paymentpro rata, from the fund remaining, of
certain specified bonds as a third class, no greater sum to be
paid, where the same were held as security, than sufficient to
satisfy the indebtedness for which they were held. In this
class the decree named Sickles and Stevens, as owners, for
the number of bonds and the amounts severally before mentioned; and Richardson and his assignee, Henry Day, for the
debt before mentioned, with the lien on 200 bonds, amounting
to the sum before mentioned. The decree then put into a
fourth class the debts, above mentioned, to Nelson and Soule,
and to Nelson, to be paid yrio rata from any surplus which
should then remain.
On the 12th of July, 1883, Sickles and Stevens were permitted, by an order of the court, to prosecute in their own
names an appeal to this court from the decree of May 3, 1883;
and by a like order, made on the same day, Richardson and
Day were allowed to appeal to this court from the same decree. The appeal bond of Sickles and Stevens was filed in the
Circuit Court on September 6, 1883, and that of Richardson
and Day on August 14, 1883.
On the 6th of August, 1883, Sickles and Stevens filed in the

OCT03EII TER]M, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Circuit Court a petition alleging that the master, in computing
the amount due to various claimants of the bonds other than
the petitioners, and who held the bonds as collateral security
and not as purchasers, had allowed to them nterest to which
they were not entitled. The petitioners seu forth that they
desired a rehearing on the point thus stated, and prayed that,
where the error had occurred, there might be a recomputation
of the interest, and a return of the overpayment, where distribution had already been made; and that, in the meantime,
the master be directed to make no further distribution of the
fund; and for such other and further relief as should be equitable and proper.
On a hearing of the matter, the court made an order, on the
1st of September, 1883, adjudging that the master had made
an erroneous computation of the interest in the case of bonds
held by divers claimants as collateral security, in that he had
allowed such claimants all coupons appearing with .d attached
to the bonds, without regard to the date when they were delivered to the holders, instead of computing interest upon them
only from the date of their delivery; and referring it to the
clerk of the court to make a computation of the interest on the
bonds, from the date of their delivery to the several persons
who held them as collateral security. The clerk reported such
computation, and stated the amount of the 200 bonds held by
Benjamin Richardson, as collateral security, to be $330,725,
instead of, as before, $374,904. It also appeared that Richardson and Day had been overpaid $2173.91; and that the
Wrought Iron Bridge Company had been overpaid $183.60.
On September 11, 1883, Nelson and Soule were allowed an
appeal from the decree of May 3, 1883; and on that day
Thomas M. Nelson was also allowed an appeal from the same
decree. An appeal bond on each of these two appeals was
filed in the Circuit Court on October 15, 1883.
On the 8th of October, 1883, the court, on a further hearing,
entered a decree which recited that the cause "came on to be
reheard;" and also recited the filing of the petition by Sickles
and Stevens for a rehearing, and the making of the reference
to the clerk and his report, and stated that it appeared "to

RICHARDSON v. GREEN.
Opinion of the Court.

this court that a rehearing should be had, and a correction
made in the decree" of May 3, 1883, and, after reciting the
provisions of that decree in regard to paying the creditors in
the third class, then proceeded to give a new list of the third
class, putting down Sickles and Stevens as the owners respectively of the same number of bonds, for the same amounts, as
in the decree of May 3, 1883, and the debt of Richardson and
Day at the same amount as in that decree, with a lien on 200
bonds, amounting to $330,725, instead of $3714,904, as in that
decree. It also adjudged that the Wrought Iron Bridge Company had been overpaid $183.60, and Henry Day, assignee of
Benjamin Richardson, $2173.91, and that they should severally
pay into the court those sums, which should be distributed
among the remaining several claimants, in proportions and
amounts specified in the decree; among others, to Benjamin
F. Stevens, $113.25; to Daniel E. Sickles, $595.66; to J. Bower
& Co., $373.93; to John F. Betz, $357.41; to Thomas W.
Ferry, $205.02; to Hiram Hodgden, $37.49; to John A. Elwell, $16.93; to Frederick A. Nims, $40.53; and to Edward
P. Ferry, $64.32. The decree further provided "that all persons having claims against the fund created by the sale of the
mortgaged property herein, whether evidenced by bonds, coupons, or otherwise, shall present the same to this court within
five days from the date of this decree, and in default thereof
the clerk of this court shall distribute to the parties, respectively, all moneys to which they are entitled hereunder." It
further provided "that the decree of May 3, 1883, entered
herein, shall stand ratified and confirmed, except as the same
is changed and modified by this decree."
On the 17th of N~ovember, 1883, Richardson and Day were
allowed an appeal from the decree of October 8, 1883. The
appeal bond on that appeal was filed in the Circuit Court,
November 28, 1883.
The appeal of Richardson and Day from the decree of May
3, 1883, and their appeal from the decree of October 8, 1883,
are together known as No. 181. There is no other appeal but
theirs, from the decree of October 8, 1883. The appeal of
Nelson and Soule from the decree of May 3, 1883, is No. 947;

OCTOBER TERI, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

the appeal of Nelson from that decree is No. 1027; and the
appeal of Sickles and Stevens from that decree is No. 1074.

Motions are now made, in the four cases, by John Bower &
Co., and John F. Betz, to dismiss the two appeals in No. 181,
and the other three appeals, on the grounds, that the transcript of the record was not filed, and the cause was not
docketed, in this court at the term thereof next after the time
when the appeals respectively were prayed and allowed; and
that no citations were issued on any of the appeals. A motion
is also made by T. W. Ferry, Hodgden, Elwell, Nims, and E.
P. Ferry, to dismiss the foir appeals from the decree of May
3, 1883, for want of jurisdiction, and also for want of due
prosecution, because they were not lodged, or filed, or docketed,
in this court during the term next succeeding the date of their
allowance; and to dismiss the appeal, in No. 181, from the
decree of October 8, 1883, for want of jurisdiction, because
the amount involved is less than $5000; and to dismiss the appeals in Nos. 947 and 1027, for want of citations; and to dismiss all five of the appeals, because the appellees are not
described in them with certainty.
As to Nos. 947, 1027 and 1074, the appeal in each is from
the decree of May 3, 1883. In Nos. 947 and 1027, the appeals
were allowed by an order of court, made in open court, on
the 11th of September, 1883; and in No. 1074, by an order of
court, made in open court, on the 12th of July, 1883. In
No. 947, the transcript of the record was filed, and the case
docketed, in this court, January 26, 1888; in No. 1027, June
26, 1888 ; and in No. 1074, August 30, 1888. The term of this
court next ensuing the allowance of the several appeals in Nos.
947, 1027 and 1074, from the decree of May 3, 1883, was the
October Term, 1883. That term commenced on the 8th of
October, 1883, and ended on the 5th of May, 1884. The transcript of the record fied in all five of the appeals is certified
by the clerk of the Circuit Court by a certificate bearing date
October 4, 1884:. The same transcript of the record is filed in
all of the appeals. The transcript left the office of the clerk
of the Circuit Court on October 6, 1884, and was sent by express, and reached the clerk of this court on October 10, 1884;

but no step was taken by any of the parties appellant, in No.
947, No. 1027, or No. 1074, to furnish security to the clerk for
the payment of his fees, under § 1 of Rule 10 of this court, or
to have the transcript filed, or the case docketed, or an appearance entered, at the term of this court next after the allowances of the app6als, to wit, the October Term, 1883.
The rule being well settled that this court will not entertain

an appeal where the transcript of the record is not filed in this
court at the term next succeeding the taking of the appeal,
Credit Co. v. Akcansas Central Railway Co., 128 U. S. 2 8,
259, and cases there cited, unless a recognized satisfactory excuse for the laches is made, it is sought in these cases to show
such excuse by the following facts: In October, 1883, the
appellants* Richardson and Day as one party, Sicldes and

Stevens as one party, and Nelson and Soule and Thomas A.
Nelson as one party, gave to the clerk of the Circuit Court a
joint verbal order to make a transcript of the record without
unnecessary delay, and forward it to the clerk of this court,
the three parties to pay to the former clerk the fees therefor
pro rata, according to the amounts of their respective claims.
After such order to the clerk, the appeal of Richardson and
Day from the decree of October 8, 1883, was taken. The
clerk did not know that each appeal was a separate matter, but
believed that all the appeals made but one case, and that, if
the record should reach this court in time for any one appeal,
it would bring up the case as a whole, with all the appeals;
and he understood and believed, while he was copying the
record, that if the transcript should arrive at the office of the
clerk of this court on or before October 15, 1884, it would be
in ample time to make all of the appeals valid, on the filing
and docketing of the transcript. The clerk prepared the transcript as soon as he could, having regard to the other duties of
his office and to the size of the record, (which makes 1235
printed pages, as printed here). He did nbt complete the
making of the transcript until about June 24, 1884, and forwarded it by express to the clerk of this court on October 6,
1884. These facts are supported by an affidavit of the clerk,
and by one of the solicitor for Nelson and Soule, to the same
effect.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

We cannot admit the validity of this excuse, in regard to
the three appeals in question. All suitors in this court are
bound by its written rules, and its practice and decisions are
established and known. The same ruling must apply to the
appeal in No. 181, from the decree of May 3, 1883. That appeal was allowed July 12, 1883. The transcript of the record
was not certified until October 4, 1884, and did not reach the
hands of the clerk of this court until October 10, 1884, all of
which occurred after the expiration of the October Term, 1883,
of this court. That appeal therefore fails, with the other
three.
But the appeal in No. 181, of Richardson and Day, from the
decree of October 8, 1883, was allowed on November 17, 1883,
after the commencement of the October Term, 1883, of this
court. It was, therefore, returnable to the October Term, 1884,
of this court. The transcript, as before stated, was put into
the hands of the clerk of this court, in his office, on the 10th
of October, 1884. The counsel for Day and Richardson took
no further step in the matter until September 25, 1885, when
he wrote to the clerk of this court, desiring his appearance to
be entered for them. After some further correspondence, the
counsel was informed by the clerk that, although the latter
had received the record in October, 1884, the appeals had not
been docketed, because the rule as to a deposit for costs (Rule
10) and that as to the entry of appearance (Rule 9) had not
been complied with. On a compliance with such rules, and
on the 26th of October, 1885, the case was docketed, and an
appearance for Richardson and Day was entered.
The principle applicable to such a state of facts is that established by the decision in Edwards v. United States, 102 U. S.
575. In that case, a writ of error was issued, returnable at
October Term, 1877. A transcript of the record was lodged in
the office of the clerk of this court in September, 1877, but by
an oversight of the counsel for the plaintiff in error no fee bond
was given, and the cause was not docketed during October
Term, 1877. In September, 1878, an acceptable fee bond was
given, and the cause was formally docketed. A motion was
made, at October Term, 1880, to dismiss the writ of error. Thi,-

RICHARDSON v. GREEN.
Opinion of the Court.

court denied the motion, and said (p. 576): "We are aware
that in some of the cases it has been said that a writ of error
or an appeal becomes inoperative if a transcript is not filed and
the cause docketed during the term to which it is made returnable, but this has always been in cases where a return had not
been made and a transcript had not been filed within the time.
The language should therefore be construed in connection with
those facts. In Owings v. Tiernan's Lessee, 10 'Pet. 447, and
'an, Rensselaer v. Watts, 7 How. 784, leave was given to
docket the cause after the term, when the transcript had been
filed in time, but through inadvertence a fee bond had not
been given and there had not been in the meantime a motion
to docket and dismiss.

That is this case.

.

.

.

If a re-

turn is made and the transcript deposited in the clerk's office
in time, our jurisdiction is kept alive. The docketing of the
cause after that is mere procedure, and if unreasonably delayed, the parties may be subjected to the consequences of a
failure to prosecute a suit, which rest largely in the discretion
of the court, when not provided for by rules. Rule 9 is of that
class."
In the present case, although the transcript of the record in
No. 181 was filed and the case was docketed on October 26,
1885, no motion to dismiss was made until the present term;
and, under the foregoing views, we are of opinion that the
appeal of Richardson and Day from the decree of October 8,
1883, cannot be dismissed on the ground that the case was not
actually docketed during October term, 1884.
One ground urged for dismissing the appeal of Richardson
and Day from the decree of October 8, 1883, is that, although
that appeal was allowed by an order of court, made in open
court on the 17th of November, 1883, at the same term at
which the decree of October 8, 1883, was entered, yet the
bond given to perfect such appeal was approved by the district
judge on November 28, 1883, apparently out of court, although
filed in the court on that day; and that, under these circumstances, a citation to the appellees was necessary, and none
appears ever to have been issued.
As the appeal in question was allowed in open court, during
VOL. CXXX-8

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

the term at which the decree appealed from was rendered,
and that appeal was perfected by the filing in due time of a
bond duly approved, and the transcript of the record was, as
we have held, duly lodged in this court at the next ensuing
term thereof, namely, October Term, 1884, in such manner as
to give this court jurisdiction of the case, no citation was necessary, unless the bond was accepted after the term at which
the appeal was allowed. In the present case, it does not
appear that the appeal bond was accepted in open court, or at
or during the term at which the appeal was allowed; and a
citation would seem to have been necessary. Sage v. Railroad Co., 96 U. S. '712, 715; Hewitt v. Filbert, 116 U. S. 142,
144; Brown v. McConnell, 124: U. S.489, 491.
But, as to a citation, this case falls within the ruling in
Dodge v. Enowles, 114 U. S. 430, 438, where it is said: "The
judicial allowance of an appeal in open court at the term in
which the decree has been rendered is sufficient notice of the
taking of an appeal. Security is only for the due prosecution
of the appeal. The citation, if security is taken out of court,
or after the term, is only necessary to show that the appeal
which was allowed in term has not been abandoned by the
failure to furnish the security before the adjournment. It is
not jurisdictional. Its only purpose is notice. If by accident
it has been omitted, a motion to dismiss an appeal allowed in
open court, and at the proper term, will never be granted until
an opportunity to give the requisite notice has been furnished;
and this, whether the motion was made after the expiration of
two years from the rendition of the decree or before."
In Hewitt v. .Filbert,(supra,)it is said (p. 144): "The allowance by the court in session before the end of the term at
which the decree was rendered, and when both parties are
either actually or constructively present, is in the nature of an
adjudication of appeal, which, if docketed here in time, gives
this court jurisdiction of the subject matter of the appeal, with
power to make all such orders, consistent with the practice of
courts of equity, as may be appropriate and necessary for the
furtherance of justice."
But the issuing of a citation may be waived by the appel-

RICIARDSON v. GREEN.
Opinion of the Court.

lees; and a general appearance by them is a waiver of a citation. Alviso v. United States, 5 Wall. 824; Sage v. Railroad
Co., 96 U. S. 712, 715. In No. 181 a general appearance for
the appellees, T. W. Ferry, Hodgden, Elwell, Nims and E. P.
Ferry, was entered in this court on January 11, 1889. As to
John Bower & Co. and. John F. Betz no general appearance
for them has been entered in No. 181, but only, on January
14, 1889, an appearance specially for the making of the motion
by them. This is not a waiver of a citation.
Under these circumstances, a citation will be issued by this
court, on the appeal in No. 181 by Richardson and Day from
the decree of October 8, 1883, to the appellees in that appeal
who have not entered here a general appearance in No. 181,
returnable at the next term of this court, unless the issuing
of such citation shall be duly waived on the part of such
appellees.
It is also urged, in the motion made by Thomas W. Ferry
and others to dismiss the appeal in No. 181 from the decree of
October 8, 1883, that this court has. no jurisdiction of it, because the amount involved is not more than $5000. The
ground urged is, that the amount involved, so far as that
appeal by Richardson and Day is concerned, is only $21'[3.91,
which is the amount that Day, as assignee of Richardson, was
directed to pay into court as having been overpaid on his claim.
It appears by the master's report that he disallowed the
claim of Richardson as pledgee or- purchaser of 400 bonds
other than the 200 bonds the claim to which was allowed to
Richardson. The amount of money involved in the claim of
Richardson and Day to these 400 bonds largely exceeds the
sum of $5000. This claim is fairly brought up by their appeal
from the decree of October 8, 1883, because that decree contains an express provision "that the decree of May 3, 1883,
entered herein, shall stand ratified and confirmed except as
the same is changed and modified by this decree."
Moreover, the Circuit Court, by reason of the petition of
Sickles and Stevens for a rehearing, and by reason of the
rehearing which was had, did not lose its hold upon the fund
to be distributed, nor part with its control of the cause, until

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

the decree of October 8, 1883, was made, so far as claims
against the fund created by the sale of the mortgaged property were concerned. That decree contained a provision that
persons having claims against such fund, whether evidenced
by bonds, coupons, or otherwise, should present the-same to
the court within five days from the date of that decree, and
that, in default thereof, the clerk should distribute to the
parties the moneys in his hands.
These provisions save the appeal of Richardson and Day
from the decree of October 8, 1883, as to amount, and enable
them to have adjudicated by this court, on the hearing of that
appeal, at least their claim in respect of the 400 bonds not
allowed to them.
It is also objected, on the motion to dismiss made by Thomas
W. Ferry and others, that, in the order of November 17, 1883,
allowing an appeal to Richardson and Day from the decree of
October 8, 1883, the appellees are not named, but it is stated
only that "the other parties of said cause, original and intervening, (as appearing in the said final decree,)" are "appellees." But the bond on such appeal, filed November 28, 1883,
is given to the clerk of the Circuit Courtfor the use and benefit of twenty-five appellees, naming them, and among them
are by name the five appellees by whom the motion on that
ground is made. We think the objection is not a good one.
It resultsfrom these views that the appeals in !Vo. 947, -Yo.
1027 and .Vo. 1074 must be dismissed; that the appeal in
1t. 181from the decree of Mifay 3, 1883, must be dismissed;
ana that the motion to dismiss the appeal of Richardson
and Day, in _1'o. 181,from the decree of October 8, 1883,
must be granted,unless the apellants therein shall procure
to be issued and served on the appellees therein a citation
from this court, in the terms before set forth, returnableat
the next term thereof,provided the issuing and service of
such citation shall not be duly waived; and it is ordered
that such citation shall issue, if a request therefor shall be
filed with the clerk.
As Richardson has died since the day these motions were
argued, the order to be made will be entered nunc pro tunc,
as of that day, February4, 1889.
