of a majority of the county commissioners to prosecute the
appeal, and their application to the court below to vacate
the order allowing it. The appeal had been perfected, and the
jurisdiction over the cause thus transferred to this court, before the attention of the court below was called to the action
of the majority. Whether such majority could afterwards
authorize a withdrawal of the appeal, holding the relation the
commissioners do to the county, need not now be discussed.
But there is a ground, not taken by the respondent, which
forces itself upon our consideration, and that is, that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory is not in form a
final judgment. It not merely reversed the judgment of the
District Court, but remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings according to law and the judgment of the
appellate court. A judgment of a lower appellate court
which reverses the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction, and remands the case to it for further proceedings, is
not a final judgment. A judgment of reversal is only final
when it also enters or directs the entry of a judgment which
disposes of the case. On this ground, therefore, as well as on
the previous ground, the appeal must be
Dismissed.

LYON v. ALLEY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No.149.

Argued January 7, 8, 1889.-Decided April 1, 1889.

Under the laws in force in the District of Columbia, when the cause
of action in this case arose, the failure of the commissioner of improvements to deposit with the register a statement exhibiting the
cost of setting the curbstone and paving the footway in front of each
lot or part of lot, separately, and the amount of tax to be paid by each
proprietor, the failure of the register to place without delay in the
hands of the collector a list of the persons taxed and the failure of the
collector to give the required notice to such persons, rendered invalid a

Statement of the Case.
tax sale under those laws and certificates thereof, as against an innocent
purchaser.
The provisions in those laws respecting the deposit of such statement with
the register, the placing the list in the hands of the collector, and the
notice to the owners were intended as a condition precedent, a strict
compliance with which was necessary in order to make the tax a lien
upon the lots.
An erasure and interlineation in an assessment roll in the District of
Columbia, made nearly twelve months after it was completed and deposited in the register's office, and after lots not assessed had passed into
the ownership of a bonafide purchaser, is neither a reassessment nor an
amendment of the original assessment. Although the illegality of a tax
sale is patent on the face of the proceedings, if the property was acquired by a bona fide purchaser before the sale and without notice of
the tax, a court of equity has jurisdiction to remove the cloud upon the
title.

The case, as stated by the court in its opinion, was as follows:
This is a suit in equity, brought by the appellee in the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to remove clouds
from, and to quiet the title to, certain real estate in the city
of Washington. The property is described as lots 1 to 12,
inclusive, square 156, fronting on the north side of P Street
north, between 17th and 18th Streets west, in that city, and
was at one time owned in fee simple by the plaintiff, John B.
Alley, who subdivided the lots and sold portions thereof to
certain persons named, to whom he gave bonds of indemnity
as a security against the claim of the defendant, Isaac S.
Lyon. Alley and his grantees are in actual possession of the
property, and this suit is brought, therefore, for the benefit of
all of them. The claim of the defendant is derived from certain certificates of tax sale issued to him by the District of
Columbia, October 15, 1881, the tax being a special improvement tax for setting the curbstones and paving the footways
and gutters along the front line of the property.
The bill, after alleging these facts, sets out the various steps
and processes by which the claim of the defendant originated,
which is alleged to be invalid and illegal, and charges that
the said certificates were issued without authority of law and

LYON v. ALLEY.
Statement of the Case.

are not any evidence of title to, or lien upon the said lots.
The relief asked for is a decree declaring the tax sale void,
and an injunction against Lyon from setting up any right,
title or claim by virtue of the certificates issued to him on his
purchase.
The defendant answered denying the validity of the title of
the plaintiff and his grantees, and also filed a cross-bill setting
out in detail the proceedings by which his own claim originated; alleging that such claim was valid and legal, and superior in law and in equity to that of the plaintiff and his grantees; and praying that his certificates might be decreed a lien
upon the lots. Upon an agreed statement of facts, the court
at special term rendered a decree in accordance with the
prayer of the cross-bill. Upon appeal to the court in general
term that decree was reversed, and a decree made in accordance with the prayer of the original bill; and an appeal from
the latter decree brings the case here.
The material facts as gathered from the record, are substantially as follows: On the 2d of November, 1869, the then corporation of the city of Washington passed the following act:
That the mayor be, and he is
"Be it enacted, . .
hereby, authorized and required to cause the curbstones to be
set and the footways and gutters paved on the north side of
P Street north, between Sixteenth Street west and Rock
Creek, the work to be contracted for and executed in the
manner and under the superintendence provided by law, and
to defray the expenses of said improvements a special tax,
equal to the cost thereof, is hereby imposed and levied on all
lots or parts of lots bordering on the line of the improvement;
the said tax to be assessed and collected in conformity with
the provisions of the act approved October 12, 1865." Acts
67th Council, c. 236, p. 116.
The act of October 12, 1865, referred to, extended prior
acts of M ay 23 and 24, 1853, to special improvements thereafter made, and provided that the cost and expense of every
local improvement thereafter made, "unless otherwise provided for in the act or acts ordering the same, shall be levied,
assessed, collected and paid, and the payment thereof enforced," as provided in those acts. Webb's Digest, 360-2.

OCTOBER TERTM, 1888.
Statement of the Case.

The act of May 23, 1853, (Webb's Digest, 155,) provided for
proposals for setting curbstones, etc., petition for the improvement and plan of the property, time within which the improvement is to be made, and by its 5th section required the appointment of two assistant commissioners.
Its 6th section reads
as follows:
"So soon as the setting and paving of any such curbstone
and footway shall have been completed by the commissioner
of improvements, he shall deposit with the register a statement, exhibiting the cost of setting the curbstone and paving
the footway in front of each lot or part of lot, separately, and
the amount of tax to be paid by each proprietor of said lots
or parts of lots, and the register shall then, without delay,
place in the hands of the collector of taxes a list of the persons
chargeable with such tax, together with the amount due by
each person; and the collector shall, within ten days after
receiving such list, give notice in writing to each proprietor,
if residents of this city; if non-residents, then to their tenants
or agents, if known, stating the amount of tax by them respectively due, and requiring that the same be paid within thirty
days from the date of such notice; and if any of the taxes so
due shall remain unpaid for more than thirty days after the
date of such notice, then the said collector shall proceed to
collect the same, together with interest in addition thereto at
the rate of ten per centum per annum, to be computed from
the date of the commissioner's return to the register, in the
same manner as other taxes upon real property are by law
collected; and the collector shall deposit the same in bank to
the credit of the ward entitled thereto, first deducting the
commissions prescribed for collecting the same."
The 8th section provided that such work shall be paid for
by certificates of stock, commonly known as "paving stock,"
issued by the mayor and given to the contractor, and redeemable from time to time as the taxes were collected.
None of the provisions of the act of May 24, 1853, are
important in connection with this case.
The act of June 10, 1867, (Webb's Digest, 467,) created an
officer known as superintendent and inspector of improvements,

LYON v. ALLEY.
Statement of the Case.

whose duty it was to prepare plats and fix grades, and to superintend the paving of footways, etc., and provided that, with two
assistant commissioners to be appointed by the mayor from
among those along or near the line of any proposed improvement, he should have the exclusive control of such improvement; further, that the superintendent and inspector should
"be charged with the duty of making all assessments on lots
bordering on any street, alley, or avenue which shall have been
paved," etc. The last act on the subject, that of October 28,
1867, (65th Council, c. 6,) provided that all taxes for paving, etc.,
should be payable in four instalments, one-fourth within thirty
days after the service of the notice by the collector of taxes,
and the remaining three-fourths in three equal annual payments, for which certificates of indebtedness bearing interest
at the rate of ten per centum per annum, and chargeable
against the property involved, should be issued by the mayor
to the contractor.
The lots in question are situated in what was formerly the
1st ward of the city of Washington, along the line of street
the pavement of which was provided for by the act of November 2, 1869, supra,and were at that time owned by one Thomas
Young.
On the 1st of April, 1870, the corporation of Washington
contracted with one Henry Birch to set the curbstones and
pave the footways and gutters in the 1st ward of the city;
and between that date and November 16, 1870, he performed
that part of the work bordering upon the lots in question, and
the same was accepted by the corporation. Its cost was
$2054.10. At that time William Forsyth was the superintendent and inspector of the paving of carriageways and footways
of the corporation under the act of June 10, 1867. When
the work under Birch's contract was completed Forsyth, as it
was his duty to do, entered all of it in the ward book with
the proper proportionate charge against each lot, with the
exception of that appertaining to the lots in question. As to
these no entry was made until November, 1871, when the following was interlined in red ink: "Entered November 17,
1870. This work was done at this date, but, by request of

the owner, not entered until Nov. -, 1871. Wm. Forsyth,
S'v'yor, D. C."
On the 13th day of January, 1871, there were issued to
Henry Birch fifty-two certificates of paving stock for the four
instalments, being for the entire amount on the assessment
roll, except as to the twelve lots in question.
Between November, 1870, and November, 1871, to wit,
February 21, 1871, the government of the city of Washington
was succeeded by that of the District of Colum.bia, and Forsyth became the surveyor of the District.
The contractor testifies on oath that he had nothing to do
with the omission of the lots in question from the assessment
roll, and, in fact, knew nothing of such omission; that during
the progress of the work the Qwner of the lots, Thomas Young,
promised in person to pay in full for the improvements when
finished, provided he, Birch, would deduct ten per cent from
the contract price, and that he, Birch, agreed to this arrangement. When the entries relative to the lots were made, in
November, 1871, the collector entered the amounts in the
"special ledger" in his office as assessed against 'the lots, and
then gave the notice thereof prescribed by law. Certificates
of indebtedness against the lots, agreeably to the act of October 28, 1867, were therefoi issued to the contractor, who sold
and transferred the same to the appellant, Lyon, for value before maturity. After their maturity, and for default in their
payment, Lyon procured the collector of taxes of the District
of Columbia, in 1881, to sell the lots in question, and bought
them in, paying the purchase price by surrendering the certificates of indebtedness aforesaid, and paying the difference in
cash. In return, he obtained twelve several certificates of tax
sale, one as to each lot, bearing date October 15, 1881.
Prior to the aforesaid entry in red ink, however, and while
the records all showed no assessment or claim of any kind
against the lots in question, to wit, October 2, 1871, Young
sold and conveyed them to Hallett Kilbourn, and by various
transfers thereafter, all made subsequent to the red ink entry,
they came into the possession and ownership of the plaintiff,
January 26, 1881.

LYON v. ALLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

In 18'75, while the title to the lots was in one James M.
Latta, a sale of them was attempted to satisfy the delinquent
taxes assessed against them as aforesaid. Latta thereupon
filed his bill in equity against the District of Columbia and
John F. Cook, collector, to enjoin such sale thereof, and a
temporary restraining order was granted on the 29th day of
July of that year, which still continues in force. Neither
Lyon nor the contractor, Birch, was made a party to that bill;
and the collector, upon the service of said restraining order,
made no entry or memorandum of the same against the lots
in question, but by mistake entered the memorandum thereof
as applying to the same numbered lots in square 256.

MP.. JUSTICE

LAYAR delivered the opinion of the court.

The court below held(1) That the act of the common council of November 2,
1869, levying a tax for the paving and curbing of P Street in
front of the lots involved in this controversy, created an inchoate lien upon them which would have been complete had
the assessment been made by the proper officer in conformity
with the law and the ordinances upon the subject;
(2) That inasmuch as the omission of this lot from the
assessment roll was not made by mistake, or through ignorance or negligence, but intentionally and at the request of
the .party then owning the lots, and as Kilbourn, before purchasing the lots, exercised proper diligence in examining the
records, and found no claim or lien of any kind existing
against them, he should be considered as a bona fide purchaser, without notice of the lien imposed by the tax, and
therefore as having taken his title free and clear of the tax in
question; and,
(3) That as Kilbourn took the lots discharged of any lien
imposed by the tax under consideration, any subsequent par-

chaser from him would acquire the same sort of title -that
is, a title not affected by the tax certificates involved in this
case. It, therefore, granted Aley's prayer for a removal of
the cloud upon his title occasioned by such tax sale.
To the correctness of these rulings the appellant's counsel
have raised several objections, which it is necessary to consider. It is contended that the requirements of the statute,
which were not complied with, were mandatory only so far
that it was necessary they should be substantially observed;
and that unless some injustice has been done, or some inequality occasioned, equity will disregard a mere failure to follow the law. This proposition presents the question whether
the failure, of the commissioner to deposit with the register a
statement of the taxes upon the lots, the failure of the register
to place without delay in the hands of the collector a list of
the persons taxed, and the failure of the collector to give tie
required notice to such persons, constituted such a non-observance of the requirements of the statute as to render invalid, as
against the appellee, the tax sale and the certificates thereof

issued to the appellant.
In view of the specific and imperative language of these
provisions, .and more especially of their nature and obvious

purpose, we cannot doubt that they were intended as conditions precedent, a strict compliance with which was necessary
in order to make the tax chargeable as a lien upon the lots.
This question was directly presented and distinctly settled in
the case of French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, in which the
rule was laid down with regard to directory and mandatory
provisions of tax laws, which has been since approved by the
Federal and state courts.
In that case the defendant asserted a title to the land in
dispute under a deed executed by the sheriff of Sacramento
County, California, upon a sale on a judgment rendered for
unpaid taxes on the property described, and the whole case
turned on the validity of this tax deed. It was a case of noncompliance with the requirements of the statute the main
question being whether the departure of the officer from such
requirements rendered the sale invalid. The court said:

LYON v. ALLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

"There are undoubtedly many tatutory requisitions intended for the guide of officers in the conduct of business
devolved upon them, which do not limit their power or render
its exercise in disregard of the requisitions ineffectual. Such
generally are regulations designed to secure order, system and
despatch in proceedings, and by a disregard of which the
rights of parties interested cannot be injuriously affected.
Provisions of this character are not usually regarded as mandatory unless accompanied by negative words importing that
the acts required shall not be done in any other manner or
time than that designated. But when the requisitions prescribed are intended for the protection of the citizen, and to
prevent a sacrifice of his property, and by a disregard of
which his rights might be and generally would be injuriously
affected, they are not directory but mandatory. They must
be followed or the acts done will be invalid. The power of
the officer in all such cases is limited by the manner and conditions prescribed for its exercise."
Judge Cooley in his work on taxation refers to this case,
and says: "The doctrine therein stated seems a sound and just
rule, and may be reasonably believed to be in accord with the
legislative will in the cases to which it is applied." Chief Justice Shaw in the earlier case of Torrey v. -Millbury,21 Pick.
64, lays down the same rule in nearly the same terms.
The rule thus stated applies unquestionably to the case
before us, which is a much stronger one in the number and
character of the prerequisites to the tax sale which were disregarded. The provisions of statutes as to the form and mode
of assessments, as to tax lists, and the place where the tax lists
are to be deposited, are, according to the highest authority,
designed for the benefit of the taxpayers, and the protection
of their property from sacrifice. Sandwich v. Fish, 2 Gray,
298, 301; Cooley, Taxation, 216, 217, 218. When, therefore,
Kilbourn, from whom the appellee derivel title, purchased the
lots in question, there was, so far as we can learn from the
record in this case, nothing in the register's office or in the
collector's office, or in the hands of the latter, to put a bona
fide purchaser upon notice either actual or constructive.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

We cannot concur with the counsel for appellant in the
proposition that the requirements of the statute were substantially complied with. The erasure and interlineation in
the assessment roll, made nearly twelve months after it was
completed and deposited in the register's office, and after the
lots not assessed had passed into the ownership of a bona fde
purchaser, cannot be considered in any sense as a re-assessment,
or an amendment of the original assessment. It was simply
an unauthorized and improper alteration, by a person with
not even the semblance of authority, of an official document
in the assessor's office, where the law required it to be. Its
only effect, if it has any, is to show, in connection with other
facts upon the record, that the withholding of the assessment
of these lots was not a mere mistake of the officers, but the
result of an agreement between the then owner of the lot and
the contractor, whereby the former promised to pay, and the
latter to accept, 90 per cent of the contract price for the improvements in lieu of the certificates of indebtedness otherwise
to be issued by the mayor, and that, in pursuance of this agreement, the assessment of the lots was omitted by the officer at
the request of the owner, and those certificates of indebtedness
were not issued until more than twelve months after the certificates for the other improvements were issued, and until
after the lands had been sold to Kilbourn. We are of opinion
that Kilbourn obtained a title to the lots in question free from
the lien of the alleged assessment, and that Alley acquired the
same title alike unencumbered.
But it is contended that even if we adopt the conclusion
reached by the court below, as to the illegality of the tax sale
and the nullity of the certificate issued to the appellee, still
the case made by the appellee does not show such a cloud upon
his title as calls for relief from a court of equity. In other
words, that when the illegality of a tax sale is patent upon
the face of the proceedings, as is the case as to the sale here
complained of, the jurisdiction of a court of equity to remove
a cloud does not attach. The case of ctannewin~le v. Georgetown, 15 Wall. 547, cited by counsel, fails to support the contention that such is the law of this court. That case was not

LYON v. ALLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

a suit to remove a cloud from a title. The complainant filed
a bill to enjoin the collection of a tax, alleged to be illegal,
and the court decided that there was no remedy in equity to
enjoin the collection of a tax, upon the sole ground of its ille-

gality.
It is a well settled doctrine of this court that equity will
not interpose to arrest the proceedings for the collection of a
tax, upon the sole ground of its illegality. It is equally well
settled by the decisions of this court and the state courts, that
after the land has been sold, and a conveyance of some sort
made to the purchaser, courts of equity have inherent jurisdiction to give relief to the owner against vexatious litigation
and threatened injury to the market value of the land, by
removing the cloud which such illegal sale, and the illegal
claim arising from it, may cast upon the title. And in such
case of damage, either existing or apprehended, equity will
interpose for relief, even during the progress of the proceedings before the sale.
In the Union Pacftc Raiway Co. v. Cheyenne, 113 U. S.
516, 525, this court thus presents the whole law on this point:
"It cannot be denied that bills in equity to restrain the
collection of taxes illegally imposed have frequently been
sustained. But it is well settled that there ought to be some
equitable ground for relief besides the mere illegality of the
tax; for it must be presumed that the law furnishes a remedy
for illegal taxation. It often happens, however, that the case
is such that the person illegally taxed would suffer irremediable
damage, or be subject to vexatious litigation, if he were compelled to resort to his legal remedy alone. For example, if
the legal remedy consisted only of an action to recover back
the money after it had been collected by distress and sale
of the taxpayer's lands, the loss of his freehold by means of
a tax sale would be a mischief hard to be remedied. Even the
cloud cast upon his title by a tax under which such a sale
could be made would be a grievance which would entitle him
to go into a court of equity for relief."
It may be proper to observe that in the present case the
illegality does not appear wholly on the face of the record,

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

but that it is shown in part by evidence outside, to wit, the
fact that the title to the land sought to be charged was acquired
by a bonafde purchaser without notice. We think, therefore,
that the allegations of the bill and the facts proved in this
case bring it fully within the equity jurisdiction of the court.
Another ground upon which we are asked to reverse the
decision of the court below is, that apart from the tax sale
certificates, the act, itself a notice to all purchasers, in terms
levied the tax directly upon the lots in question, and thereby
a lien attached at once, and, the lien never having been removed, the decree should have required the appellee to pay to
the defendant the amount of the tax due before granting the
relief prayed for.
It is clear that the act does not in so many words create an
express lien, and that the acts of Congress do not expressly
confer upon the corporation the authority to create such liens.
The statement therefore, must be taken as true, only in the
sense that every municipal tax, in cases of local improvement,
paving, etc., involves a lien upon the particular real estate on
which it is imposed. The error of the argument of counsel,
we think, lies in the assumption that the lien attaches at the
date of the passage of the act. The general rule is, that when
no time is expressly fixed by the statute for the lien to take
effect, it accrues upon the assessment of the tax. Now, the
act of the common council imposed and levied a tax to defray
the cost of the improvement, but it also declared that the tax
should be assessed and collected in conformity with the provisions of certain acts which prescribed in detail, the mode,
manner, and time of assessment, and the different steps to be
taken preliminary to such assessment and collection. If any
lien was created by the terms of the statute, it must have
existed and attached according to such terms and conditions
as were prescribed by the law creating it.
In the case of Heine v. The Levee Commissioners, 19 Wall.
655, 659, the court said:
"Nor need we decide whether taxes once lawfully levied
are, until paid, a lien on the property against which they are
assessed, though it is laid down in the very careful work of

WILLIAMSON v. NEW JERSEY.

189

Syllabus.

Judge Dillon, that taxes are not liens upon the property
against which they are assessed, unless made so by the charter, or unless the corporation is authorized by the legislature
to declare them to be liens. But here no taxes have been
assessed except those which have been released by the bondholders accepting new bonds for the interest of the year so
assessed. And it is too clear for argument that taxes not
assessed are no liens, and that the obligation to assess taxes is
not a lien on the property on which they ought to be assessed."
From the record before us, we think the decision of the
court below, that no lawful assessment of the tax had been
made; that no lien upon the lots in question exists; and that
the appellant is not entitled to the relief prayed for in his
cross-bill, accords fully with the decisions of this court, above
referred to.
As the points disposed of are decisive of the case, we deem
it unnecessary to discuss the effect of the temporary restraining order upon the validity of the collector's sale. The decree
of the Supreme Court is
Aflimed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 193. Argued March 12, 189.-Decided April 1, 1889.
The legislature of New Jersey, by a statute, enacted that a "poor farm,"
belonging to the city of New Brunswick, and situated in the township
of North Brunswick, should be at all times thereafter liable and subject
to taxation by that township so long as it should be embraced within its
limits. Subsequently, it was enacted by a statute, that the property of
the cities of the State, and all land used exclusively for charitable purposes should be exempt from taxation, and that all inconsistent acts
were repealed. The "poor farm" was used exclusively for charitable
