Statement of the Case.

NATIONAL MUTUAL BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION v. BRAHAN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.
No. 158. Argued February 25, 26, 1904.-Decided April 4, 1904.

Where the plaintiff in error, defendant below, after filing a general issue
moves to amend, claiming rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and
on the trial asks an instruction based on his rights thereunder, he is
entitled to the instruction if the rights asserted actually exist, and the
Federal question is raised in time, and the writ of error will not be dismissed.
The impairment of contract clause of the Federal Constitution cannot be
invoked against what is merely a change of decision in the state court,
but only by reason of a statute enacted subsequent to the alleged contract and which has been upheld or effect given it by the state court.
Where a corporation has become localized in a State and accepted the laws
of the State as a condition for doing business there, it cannot abrogate
those laws by attempting to make contract stipulations, and there is no
violation of the full faith and credit clause in instructing the jury to find
according to the local law and not according to the laws of another
State, notwithstanding a clause in the contract that it should be construed according to the laws of the latter.

THIS action was brought in the Circuit Court of Louderdale
County, Mississippi, to recover interest, claimed to have been
usurious, paid by defendant in error to plaintiff in error upon
a loan made by the latter to him. The action was brought
under section 2348 of the Code of the State of 1892, which
provides as follows:
"The legal rate of interest on all notes, accounts and contracts shall be six per centum; but contracts may be made, in
writing, for the payment of a rate of interest as great as ten
per centum per anuum. And if a greater rate of interest thain
ten per centum shall be stipulated for, or received in any case,
all interest shall be forfeited, and may be recovered back,
whether the contract be executed or executory; but this section
shall not apply to a building and loan association domiciled in
this State, dealing only with its members."

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Statement of the Case.

193 U. S.

The case was tried to a jury, which, under the instructions
of the court, returned a verdict for the defendant in error, upon
which judgment was duly entered. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 80 Mississippi,
407. This writ of error was then sued out.
The plaintiff in error is a building and loan association,
incorporated under chapter 122 of the Laws of the State of
New York, passed April 10, 1851, entitled "An act for the
incorporation of building, mutual loan and accumulating fund
associations," and the acts amendatory thereof, to witchap. 564, passed June 9, 1875; chap. 96, passed April 1, 1S7s.
The purpose of the association is to make loans only to its
members, and for the further purpose of accumulating a fund
to be returned to its members who do not receive advances on
their shares.
The management of the association is vested in a board of
directors, who have power to make by-laws. There is a president and other officers and a standing committee. The latter
passes on all applications for loans. Membership is obtained
by holding five or more shares of the association and subscribing for membership. Shares are divided into three
classes, instalment shares, paid-up shares and interest bearing paid-up shares. We are only directly concerned with
the first class. They are described in the articles of the
association as follows:
"SEc. 2. Instalment shares.-Instalment shareg shall be
issued in monthly series, and shall be dated the first business
day of the month, and shall be due and become payable whenever the amount in the loan fund to the credit of such slares,
consisting of monthly dues and profits apportioned to such
shares, shall equal the face value of the shares."
It is provided, article 10, that dues on each instalment share
shall be sixty cents per month until the maturity of the shares.
There is also a provision for fines and f9rfeitures. The loan
fund and loans are provided for as follows:
"SEC. 1. The loan fund of the association shall consist of

NATIONAL MUTUAL B. & L. ASSN. v. BRAHAN. 637
193 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

fifty cents of the monthly dues paid in on each share, interest,
premiums, fines and forfeitures, and the profits derived therefrom, and shall be loaned to members of the association by the
board of directors upon approved applications for loans in the
order in which they have been filed.
"SEc. 2. Interest at the rate of not more than six per cent
per annum will be charged upon all loans, which interest must
be paid monthly, with the monthly dues, on or before the last
business day of each month, until the maturity of the pledged
shares, and a premium of not more than fifty cents per month
will be charged on each one hundred dollars borrowed, which
premium must be paid on or before the last business day of the
month, for a period of eight years, or until the maturity of the
pledged shares, should they mature before the expiration of
the eight years. The premium for the first six months to be
paid in advance.
"SEc. 3. A member may pay such loan at any time after
one year, on giving thirty days' notice in writing to the secretary, upon the payment of the amount borrowed, with interest
and premium thereon, and a redemption fee of fifty cents per
share. No redemption fee shall be charged on matured shares."
It is also provided that loans on real estate shall be secured
by a first mortgage on the property offered for security, by
promissory notes, bonds, mortgages and deeds of trust of the
applicant, or such other instruments as may be required,
"and for every loan of $100 he shall, in addition thereto,
transfer to the association at least one share thereof as collateral security."
In 1892 the plaintiff in error had an agent in the city of
Meridian, Mississippi, who was authorized to receive applications
for stock and loans, and to receive payment of dues, interest
and premiums, and to transmit the applications and payments to plaintiff in error at its office in New York. The
domicil of the plaintiff in error was and is New York. The
defendant in error in 1892 was a citizen of the city of Meridian,
,nd made application through the agent of plaintiff in error

OCTOBER TERMI, 1903.
Statement of the Case.

193 U. S.

at Meridian for a loan of $2,500, and to subscribe for twentyfive shares of stock, as required by articles of plaintiff in error.
The loan was granted by the executive committee under the
terms and according to the conditions of the articles of association. Defendant in error made the following payments
"as dues, interest, premium and fines on said stock and loan,
to wit: Advance premium sent the association at New York,
$66.25; paid defendant's agent at Meridian, as shown by the
receipt book hereto attached, $668.75, and $2,500 paid the
association in New York by draft sent them on November 7,
1893, in full payment of said loan on May 21, 1892."
Defendant in error repaid this loan, but retained his twentyfive shares of stock, and paid his dues thereon for the months
of December, 1893, to August, 1894, exclusive, amounting to
the sum of $135.
In October, 1894, he withdrew five shares and received from
plaintiff in error $73.90, the withdrawal value thereof.
In June, 1894, he made an application for another loan on
his twenty shares, which was forwarded to plaintiff in error
in New York by C. F. Woods, its agent. The loan was granted
by the executive committee, and in consideration of the loan
he executed to plaintiff in error a bond, assignment of shares
and mortgage of real estate.
The loan was repaid by crediting thereon the sum of $649.70,
the withdrawal value of his shares, payment by draft on New
York of the sum of $1,473.96; interest, dues, fines and premiums, $868. Part of the latter was paid through the agent
and part was sent directly to plaintiff in error.
The bond and mortgage given by defendant in error to
secure the loan recited that they were given in consideration
of such loan, and expressed as one of their conditions that
defendant in error would repay the sum loaned to plaintiff in
error "at its office in New York city, with interest for the same
at the rate of six per cent per annum until paid, together with
a monthly premium of ten dollars and no cents for eight years,
or until the earlier maturity of said shares, should they mature

NATIONAL MUTUAL B. & L. ASSN. v. BRAHAN. 639

Statement of the Case.

before the expiration of the eight years, and in addition thereto
the sum of twelve dollars and no cents for the monthly dues on
the said twenty shares, which interest, premium and dues are
payable monthly on or before the last business day of every
month, at the office of the association in New York city, until
the maturity of the said shares, except the said monthly premium, which is to be paid for eight years only, and also all
fines which may be imposed by the said association for default
in payment of said interest, premium or dues."
To the declaration of defendant in error, plaintiff in error
filed the general issue, with notice thereunder that plaintiff in
error would give in evidence and prove the facts substantially
as above stated. Subsequently, April, 1901, and August, 1901,
plaintiff in error made motions for leave to amend its notice
under the general issue. The amendments claimed rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States, also under section 10 of article 1 of that instrument, and under section 1, article 4.
Defendant in error moved to strike out the amendments on
the ground that they were filed without leave of the court.
The motion was granted.
Testimony was introduced and at its conclusion defendant
in error asked the court to direct the jury to find for him the
excess paid over six per cent on both loans. The instruction
was refused. The court, on the contrary, instructed the jury,
at the request of plaintiff in error, that the first loan was not
usurious. But the court charged the jury that the second loan
was usurious, and directed them to find for defendant in error
the sum paid by him in excess of six per cent on the loan
($2,000), with interest at six per cent per annum from July,
1899, to date of trial.
Plaintiff in error asked the court to instruct the jury substantially as follows:
1. Defendant in error, as a borrowing shareholder, was
entitled to and did share in the profits of the association, and
the contract was, therefore, valid and not usurious.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

193 U. S.

2. The contracts were made and consummated in New York
and performable there, and are to be construed by the laws of
New York, and under those laws the contract is valid and not
usurious.
3. Under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States, defendant in error had a right to become a
member and shareholder of the association, to be a borrower
from it upon the terms and conditions of its articles, and. make
contracts with it performable in the State of New York, and
reciprocally defendant in error had the right tb make the loan,
and entitled under said amendments to have the "contracts
considered and their validity determined by the laws of the
State of New York," where they were performable; and under
section 1, article 4, of the Constitution of the United States,
was entitled to have the court give full faith and credit in
determining the validity of the contracts with defendant in
error, to the public records and judicial proceedings of the
State of New York, especially the laws under which the defendant in error was incorporated, and the acts amending the
same, and the decision in the case of Concordia Association v.
Read, 93 N. Y. 474, and other decisions, which hold that the
contracts are valid and not usurious under the laws of New
York.
4. The contract is not usurious under the laws of Mississippi.
5. Section 2348 of the Annotated Code of Mississippi, as
sought to be applied, impairs the obligation of the said contracts in violation of section 10, article 1, of the Constitution
of the United States.
6. The decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi in
Sokoloski v. New South B. and L. Association, 77 Mississippi,

155, and the decisions following it having been rendered long
after the making of said contracts, in so far as they define the
public policy of Mississippi in regard to foreign building and
loan associations, are tantamount to judicial legislation, and
in violation of section 10, article 1, of the Constitution of the
United States.

.7. The evidence shows that both loans have been voluntarily
paid and settled by defendant in error with full knowledge of
all the facts.
8. As to the loan of 1894 the evidence shows that defendant
in error, being a shareholder in the association, had a right to
demand and receive advances or loans upon his shares upon the
terms and conditions set out in the articles of the association,
and the association was obliged to grant the same, and the said
contract was made in pursuance of said right and application,
and that the code of Mississippi does not govern said contract,
and is as to said contract "both ex post facto, and impairing
the obligation of said contract and in violation of sec. 10,
art. 1, of the Constitution of the United States; and under sec. 1,
art. 4, of said constitution and the laws of New York and the
Fourteenth Amendment to said Constitution the said contract
of August 30, 1894, is valid and enforcible and not usurious."
The instruction was refused, and plaintiff in error excepted.
The jury found for defendant in error for the sum of $677.96,
being amount paid in excess of the loan, and for the sum of
$93.79 interest. Judgment was entered upon the verdict. It
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, as we have
said.

Goodnow, 123 U. S. 540, 548; Roby v. Coleheur, 146 U. S. 153.
The Federal questions raised in the court below, involve a
proper construction of the contract obligation of the parties
as fixed by the articles of association of the plaintiff in error
and the statutes and decisions of the State of New York, together with the statutes and decisions of the State of Mississippi
as sought to be applied to the case in hand. The contract and
articles of association, and the provisions of ch. 122, 1851, and
ch. 564, 1875, of the laws of New York, are the only measure
of the rights and obligations of the parties hereto. This is
as true when this contract is to be construed by the courts
of Mississippi, as if the New York courts were called upon to
construe the same contract. 3 Thompson on Corp. § 3046;

The rule is the same as it is in regard to cx post facto

If acts subject the business to taxation they should also
subject it to the usury laws and other laws and the public policy

MR. JUSTICE

MCKENNA,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
It is objected that the Federal questions presented cannot be
considered "because they were not raised in time and the
proper way," and that the Supreme Court did nothing more
than decline to pass on the questions because they had not
been raised in the trial court, as required by the state practice.
The Supreme Court considered that plaintiff in error, by the
motions to amend the notice, attempted to "inject" a Federal question into the record, and that the instruction asked
by the plaintiff in error had the same purpose. The court
said: "It was another ingenious but unsuccessful effort to
inject the Federal question into the record. If the court had
allowed the amended notice and pleas to be filed, which presented nothing on the merits, but simply the alleged Federal
question, then there would have been an issue involving the
Federal question, to which an instruction would have been
appropriate."
Upon the ruling of the court upon the amendments to the
notice we are not called upon to express an opinion, but, we
think, it is very clear that plaintiff in error was entitled to
claim rights under the Constitution of the United States based
upon the case as presented. And if the rights asserted actually
existed plaintiff in error was entitled to an instruction directing
a verdict in its favor. The claim was, therefore, made in time.

NATIONAL MUTUAL B. & L. ASSN. v. BRAHAN.

Opinion of the Court.

The Federal questions presented by the record are reducible
to two, to wit: (1) That the decision of the Supreme Court of
Mississippi was in effect an impairment of the contract between plaintiff in error and defendant in error. (2) That full
faith and credit were not given to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of the State of New York.
1. This contention is untenable. We said in Bacon v. Texas,
163 U. S.207:
"Where the Federal question upon which the jurisdiction
of this court is based grows out of an alleged impairment of
the obligation of a contract, it is now definitely settled that the
contract can only be impaired within the meaning of this clause
in the Constitution, so as to give this court jurisdiction on a
writ of error to a state court, by some subsequent statute of
the State which has been upheld or effect given it by the state
court. Lehigh Water Co. v. Easton, 121 U. S. 388; New Orleans
Water Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., 125 U. S.
18; Central Land Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103, 109."
In the case at bar there was no subsequent statute. There
was a change in decision, it is contended, but against a change
of decision merely section 10, article 1, cannot be invoked.
2. If the contract between plaintiff in error and defendant
in error cannot be regarded as controlled by the law of New
York, there is no foundation for the contention that full faith
and credit were not given to the public acts and records of
New York.
A similar question was presented in the case of New York
Life Insurance Company v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 389. The
plaintiff in error in that case was a New York corporation,
having its principal place of business in the State of New York.
It maintained agents and examiners in the State of Missouri.
One of these agents solicited Cravens, at his residence in
Missouri, to insure his life in the company. Cravens assented,
and made a written api'lication for the policy sued on. The
application was made part of the policy and contained the
following provisions:

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

"That inasmuch as only the officers of the home office of the
said company in the city of New York have authority to determine whether or not a policy shall issue on any application, and
as they act on the written statements and representations
referred to, no statements, representations, promises or information made or given by or to the person soliciting or taking this application for a policy, or by or to any other person,
shall be binding on said company, or in any manner affect its
rights, unless such statements, representations, promises or
information be reduced to writing and presented to the officers
of said company, at the home office, in this application.
"That the contract contained in such policy and in this
application shall be construed according to the laws of the
State of New York, the place of said contract being agreed to
be the home office of said company in the city of New York."
Four annual premiums were paid in Missouri. The fifth
was not paid. Cravens died, and proof thereof was duly made.
A controversy arose between the widow of Cravens and the
company as to the amount due on the policy. Applying the
law of New York, the company contended that there was due
only the sum of $2,670 of paid-up insurance, and tendered that
amount. The widow contended, applying the law of Missouri,
for $10,000, less the amount of unpaid premiums, which left a
balance of $8,749.21, with interest at six per cent from the date
of the death of Cravens, and suit was brought for that amount.
She recovered judgment according to her claim, and the case
was brought here.
Describing the contentions of the company, we said that
they were reducible to one form, to wit, that the statute of
Missouri had been made by the Supreme Court of Missouri the
measure of the rights and obligations of the parties against the
agreement of the parties that the contract should be considered
as having been made in New York, and should be construed
and interpreted according to the laws of that State. The Supreme Court of Missouri decided that the statute expressed a
condition upon which the company, as a foreign corporation,

Opinion of the Court.

was permitted to do business in the State, and also expressed
the public policy of the State which parties could not by their
contracts contravene. We accepted that interpretation of
the statute and affirmed the judgment.
In the case at bar the Supreme Court of Mississippi gave the
same effect to the statute of that State as the Supreme Court
of Missouri gave to the Missouri statute. The court applied
and followed the doctrine of Shannon v. B. & L. Association,
78 Mississippi, 955, expressed as follows:
"It must be remembered that the State has the power to
prescribe the terms on which foreign corporations may do business. It is declared in § 849 of the Code of 1892, last clause,
'such foreign corporations shall not do or commit any act in
this State contrary to the laws or policy thereof, and shall not
be allowed to recover on any contract made in violation of law
or public policy.' This is the plain mandate of our law, which
must be rigidly enforced by the courts. And the code otherwise provides that (§ 2348) domestic building and loan associations are excluded from the operation of the usury laws,
but foreign building and loan associations are subject to them,
and to enforce this public policy, thus declared by the statute,
is not to give extra-territorial operation to our statutes. On
the contrary this corporation has come into the State, lochlized
its business here, through local boards scattered all over the
State, and must submit such business thus localized to the
operation of the laws of the State. To hold otherwise would
operate the grossest injustice to our citizens, and would
virtually abrogate our statutes against usury."
And again, on p. 974: "Foreign corporations wishing to do
business with our citizens, and localizing that business within
our State through local boards, must comply with the laws
of this State. They cannot, under such circumstances, enforce here stipulations in contracts allowed by the law of the
State which created them, if these stipulations violate our
laws or public policy. Such laws of such foreign States can
have, ex proprio vigore, no extra-territorial effect, and it is not

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

193 U. S.

competent for a foreign corporation whose business has been
localized in this State, or the borrower, or both, to abrogate,
by attempted contract, stipulations whose purpose it is to
evade our laws against usury, the laws of this State on that
subject.
"This holding in no way interferes with the right of a foreign
corporation whose business has not been localized here to make
contracts with borrowers, to be governed by the laws of the
State of their domicile, if there be no purpose therein to evade
the usury laws of this State. Such liberty of contracting,
exercised in good faith, is not herein interfered with. The
authorities cited to that point by counsel for appellee are not
pertinent to cases like the one before us. All the cases are
admirably collected in a note to Bank of Newport v. Cook, 46
Am. St. Rep. 171. In that note the learned editor points out,
on page 202, the distinction to be observed saying: 'The proper
answer to this argument is, that mere shams and evasions are
not permitted to counteract and annul the law, and where it
appears that the purpose of the parties in making the obligation payable in another State was to evade the laws against
usury of the State in which it was executed, it will be regarded
as infected with usury.' "
These remarks bring the case at bar within the ruling of
N. Y. Life Insurance Co. v. Cravens, supra. The decision of
the Supreme Court is, that plaintiff in error had become
"localized" in the State, had accepted the laws of the State
as a condition of doing business there, and could not, nor
could defendant in error, "abrogate by attempted contract
stipulations" those laws. See Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co.
v. Warren, 181 U. S. 73.
In Chattanooga Building &c. Association v. Denson, 189
U. S. 408, we recognized the right of a State to impose conditions upon foreign corporations doing business in the State
to the extent of holding the contracts of the corporation void
which were entered into in violation of the conditions.
There is nothing inconsistent with these views in Bedford
