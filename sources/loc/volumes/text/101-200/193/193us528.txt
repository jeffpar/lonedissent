UNITED STATES v. JONES.
UNITED STATES v. GILDERSLEEVE.
UNITED STATES v. WHEELER.
WHEELER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Nos. 197, 198, 199, 525.

Submitted Iarch 18, 1904.-Decided April 4, 194.

The making of the oath and attaching the same to the accounts of clerks of
the Circuit and District Courts of the United States as required by the
act of February 22, 1875, is a part of the formality of presenting the accounts and is not to be allowed against the Government in favor of the
clerk.
An order of the court requiring a service to be performed is sufficient authority as between the clerk and the Government for the performance of
the service and the allowance of the proper fee therefor.
Where no direction of the court can be shown charges cannot be allowed for
certificates to copies of orders.
Clause 4 of § 828, Rev. Stat., does not justify charges for administering
oaths on the voir dire of grand and petit jurors.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

These are appeals from judgments of
the Court of Claims in respect of services alleged to have been
rendered as clerks of District or Circuit Courts of the United
States. In each case the accounts for services had been duly
approved by the Circuit or District Court; certain items had
been disallowed by the accounting officers of the Treasury
Department; thereupon these suits were brought; and the
Court of Claims made findings of fact and conclusions of law.
In view of the action of the two courts, and of our previous
decisions, the points raised in argument do not seem to require particular discussion.
In No. 197 the judgment of the Court of Claims included,
among other items, this: "Administering oaths and affixing
jurats to accounts of United States marshals at ten cents for
each oath and fifteen cents for each jurat, $91.20."
By the act of February 22, 1875, 18 Stat. 333, c. 95, clerks,
marshals and district attorneys are required to render their
accounts, duly sworn to, for approval. We agree with counsel
for the Government that the making of the oath and attaching
the same to the account is a part of the formality of presenting
THE CHIEF JUSTICE:

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

such accounts, without which they are not properly rendered.
This item, therefore, should not have been allowed against the
United States in favor of the clerk. United States v. Van
Duzee, 140 U. S. 169; United States v. Jones, 147 U. S. 672;
United States v. Allred, 155 U. S. 591.
The judgment of the Court of Claims will be modified by
the omission of this item, and, as so modified, affirmed.
In No. 198 the Government objects to the allowance of
certain charges for transcript of record on writ of error in
criminal proceedings, by order of court, on behalf of an indigent defendant; for services in connection with affidavits of
poverty; and for issuing subpcenas for grand and petit jurors.
As to the transcript, the contention is that section 878 of the
Revised Statutes, providing for payment under order of court
of fees and costs when defendant under indictment is without
means, is exclusive, and does not cover the charge for this
service. Here, again, we think the question has been settle(l,
in effect, by what was said in United States v. Barber, 140 U. S.
164; United States v. Van Duzee, supra; and United States v.
Allred, supra. It was held that an order of the court requiring
a service to be performed was sufficient authority as between
the clerk and the Government for the performance of the
service and the allowance of the proper fee therefor.
Section 878 was originally enacted in 1846, and should not
be held to operate as a prohibition to the extent contended.
The indigent defendant ought not to be deprived of availing
himself of his writ of error because of his poverty, and, when
the court has ordered the transcript in the interest of justice,
the clerk ought not to be deprived of compensation.
The same considerations dispose of the objection to the
second item as to affidavits of defendants in criminal cases of
inability to pay costs. And we agree with the Court of Claims
in sustaining the charges for issuing subpoenas for grand and
petit jurors by order of court, the charge for seals being rejected. The subject is well treated in Martin v. United States,
26 C. Cl. 160. The judgment will be affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. JONES.
193 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In No. 199 counsel for United States assign error in the
allowance of charges (1) for administering oaths, by order of
court, to witnesses for defendants on trial in criminal cases;
(2) for administering oaths to affidavits of poverty and affixing
jurats; (3) for filing and entering applications for process;
(4) for filing and entering motions of indigent defendants for
new trial; (5) and for services rendered an indigent defendant,
by order of court, in prosecution of a writ of error in a capital
case. We assume that all these items relate to indigent defendants, and considering sections 828 and 878 of the Revised
Statutes, the act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 655, c. 113, our
previous decisions, and what has just been said, we perceive
no reason for declining to accept the conclusions of the Court
of Claims.
No. 525 is a cross appeal from the judgment brought up in
No. 199. We hold that the cross appeal lies in the circumstances, but agree with the disallowance by the Court of Claims
of the items involved. Two of these items consisted of charges
for certificates to copies of sci. /a., and to copies of orders of
court for furnishing meals to jurors. No direction of court
as to such certificates was shown. The other item was for
administering oaths on the voir dire of grand and petit jurors,
and we do not think can be justified under the fourth clause
of section 828. The judgment will be affirmed.
Judgments will be entered as above indicated.
