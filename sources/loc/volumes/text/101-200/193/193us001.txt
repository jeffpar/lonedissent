SUIPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

UNITED STATES v. NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 145.

Argued January 5, 1904.-fDecided February 23,1904.

The act of July 2, 1864, granting lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company did not take any lands out of the disposition of Congress until
the line of the road was definitely located bTy maps duly required by
the act, and it has been decided by this court that the Perham map of
1865 even if valid as a map of general route did not operate as a reservation.
When Congress by resolution of May 31, 1870, made an additional grant
to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company for a branch road to Puget
Sound via the valley of the Columbia, the United States still had full
title not reserved, granted, sold or otherwise appropriated to the lands of
the new grant which fell within the lines of the former grant and on completion of the branch road the railroad company was entitled to a patent
for such over-lap of said lands as it had earned. United States v. Oregon
d, Cal. R. R. Co., 176 U. S. 28, followed.

THIS was a suit brought by the United States against the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific
Railway Company to cancel patents issued in May, 1895, by
the United States to the railroad company, to whose rights
the railway company had succeeded. The lands are situated
in the State of Washington, north of Portland, in the State of
Oregon. The case was heard in the Circuit Court on facts
stipulated and the bill dismissed, whereupon it was carried to
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and that

court certified to this court certain questions on which it desired instructions. The whole record and cause were then required to be sent up for consideration.
_Xr. Charles T. Russell, Special Assistant Attorney General,
for the United States:
The facts differ from those in the Oreyoa and California
Case, 176 U. S. 28, for in this case there is no overlap but a
peculiar single scheme concerning one road and one grantee.
Every granting act is a separate law, and its intent is to be
separately inquired into. The government is equitably entitled
to some quadrangle as falling within the grant of 1864.
Congress expected in 1870 that one whole road would be
built, and had no expectation that a failure would occur at any
particular point. The maps of 1865-1870, sufficiently identilied the grant of 1864 as between grantor and grantee to exelude the lands from the grant of 1870.
The railroad company is cstopped. What is not clearly
granted belongs to the government and must not be patented
away. Doubt must make the grant fail. United States V.
Soutern Pacific, 146 U. S. 598.
Under the resolution of 1870, no grant was made of any
lands except those free from claims or rights at the time of

definite location.

See 2ortacrn, Pacift 1?. 1R. v. .Mus..e'-

Sauntry Co., 168 U. S. 608; .NrorthernPac'fic .l. B. v. Sanders, 166 U. S. 620; Nfewhall v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761 ; Southern
Pacicflv. United States, 189 U. S. 447. The Perham map was
the general route of the main line; the withdrawal requested
thereon constituted a claim. If this claim existed under the
grant of 1864, the new grant did not embrace these claimed
lands. United States v. -MortherdPacific ky., 152 U. S. 294;
Mort1hern Pacflc B y. v. Delacey, 174: U. S. 628 ; Sioux City
R. B. v. United States, 151 U. S. 349, distinguished.
After withdrawal and general route map substantial rights
to particular lands vest, there is no longer a float, the lands
cease to be public and are not intended to pass under the usual
language in subsequent grants.
Float is not a statutory word, but is a mere convenient

phrase to signify something floating or in the air. The idea
may have originated in the old case of Rutherford v. Green,
2 Wheat. 196, in which the grant to General Green of a quantity of lands in Ohio was held to pass the title inprsenti,
but required identification of the lands to make it apply to
particular lands. In the earliest railroad cases in which we
find the word "float," Railroad Co. v. Fremont County, 9

v. R'nevals, 106 U. S. 360; St. Paul R. R. v. ilinona, 112 U.
S. 720, the grant was made and the line of the road was to
be "definitely fixed," without always saying how. The court
said that there was a float until this definite fixing.
And see also Hfewlhall v. Sanger, supra; Shiver v. United
State's, 159 U. S. 633. As to effect of the filing a general map,
see besides cases already cited, .cansasPacijicv. Dunmeyer, 113

U. S. 245; Sioux City Land Co. v. Grifey, 143 U. S. 32; Thie
Bttz Case, 119 U. S. 604.
When the grant of 1870 was definitely located the grant of
1864 was not a float, but an effective grant of particular
lands. Cases supra, and .lMenotti v. Dillon, 167 U. S. 703.
The rights granted and vested under the act of 1864 were
forfeited in such a way as to benefit the Government and not
to cause the enlargement of other grants.
As to the actual decision in the Oregon and California case,
176 U. S. 28, the remarks about the Perham map are accompanied by a remark upon a merely hypothetical case which
should not overrule other decisions. See also Doherty v. Norther lPacific R. R., 177 U. S.421.
The proposition, relating to the hypothetical case of a good
Perham map and withdrawal in 1865, is that the court would,
in allowing the Oregon road to get a grant at Portland by the

grant of 1866, be overruling the general doctrine, so well settled, that a doubt is fatal to the grantee. "Silence is negation
and a doubt is fatal to the claim." Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde

M'. Clharles F Bunn for appellees:
The line east of Portland provided for in the act of 1864
formed nearly a right angle at Portland with the line
from there to Puget Sound provided for in the additional
grant of 1870. For that reason the two grants overlapped
north of Portland as illustrated in the following diagram:

Opinion of the Court.

The "overlap" in the foregoing diagram is the area included within lines ab, be, cd and da. It contains the lands in
suit.
The question being, whether these lands were, on May 31,
1870, reserved or appropriated by virtue of the grant of July
2,1864, or by virtue of any map filed or act taken under the
grant, so that they did not pass under it, it is to be noted
that the grant itself did not reserve the lands.
The settled construction of this grant is that it did not reserve or appropriate any land, or take it out of the disposing
power of Congress, until the line of road was definitely located
by map filed as the act requires. Northern Paciftc 1. R. Co.
v. Sanders, 166 U. S. 620, 634, 636; AfMenotti v. Dillon, 167
U. S. 703, 720 ; United States v. Oregon, etc., 1. Co., 176 U. S.
28, 43; Nelson v. Northern Pacific lRy. Co., 188 U. S. 108,
119.
Therefore the inquiry is further narrowed to whether the
line from Wallula to Portland had been definitely located when
the Joint Resolution of 1870 was passed.
This question is answered in the negative by the Oregon and
California case, 176 U. S. 28 ; Doherty v. Nrorthern Pacific
R1. R1., 177 U. S. 421, 432; Wisconsin Central 1R. 1R. v. Forsythe, 159 U. S. 46.
MP. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.

By the act of Congress of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 365, c. 217,
a grant was made to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
in aid of the construction of a railway from Lake Superior to
some point on Puget Sound, with a branch via the Columbia
River to a point at or near Portland, Oregon, of lands to which
"the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted,
or otherwise appropriated, and free from pregmption, or other
claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely
fixed, and a plat thereof filed in the office of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office."
On May 31, 1870, Congress passed a joint resolution making
an additional grant to the same company for the location and

construction of "its main road to some point on Puget Sound
via the valley of the Columbia River, with the right to locate
and construct its branch from some convenient point on its
main trunk line across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound."
16 Stat. 378.
The line east of Portland provided for in the act of 1864
formed nearly a right angle at Portland with the line from
there to Puget Sound provided for in the joint resolution, and
thus the two grants overlapped, and the lands in suit fell within
the overlap.
But the line down the Columbia from Wallula to Portland
was never built and the grant was forfeited September 29,
1890, 26 Stat. 496, c. 1040, while the line frou Portland to
Puget Sound and east across the Cascade Mountains was built
and the grants earned.
Holding that the lands in the overlap passed to the company
under the resolution of 1870, the Interior Department patented
those in question to the railroad company, but afterwards, and
on July 18, 1895, it was held that the lands did not pass under
that grant, because at its date they were reserved or appropriated under the grant of 1864 to the same company. 21 L.
D. 57.
That grant did not in terms reserve the lands, and the question would seem to be whether the line down the Columbia
from Wallula to Portland had been definitely located May 31,
1870, since it is settled that the act of 1864 did not take any
lands out of the power of disposition of Congress until the
line of road was definitely located by maps duly filed as required. iYortherib Paife 1?. Pt. Co. v. Sanders, 166 U. S.
620; Uinited States v. Oregon & California Rt. Pi. Co., 176
U. S. 28. The argument that the topography of the country
between Wallula and Portland was such that the lands necessarily fell within the boundaries of that grant is without merit,
for it cannot be assumed that Congress intended itself to definitely locate that part of the line in view of the language
used and the settled law on the subject.
And it does not appear that any portion of the line from
Wallula to Portland was ever definitely located, but it does

Opinion of the Court.

appear that the line from Portland to Puget Sound was definitely located under the resolution of May 31, 1870, in part
September 13, 1873, and the remainder September 22, 1882;
that the road was completed as located, and was accepted by
the government.
It is true that, March 6, 1865, Josiah Perham, then president of the Northern Pacific Company, transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior a map of the general line of the road,
which the Secretary transmitted to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, with the recommendation that the lands
along the line indicated be withdrawn. But the Commissioner
protested against the acceptance of the map, and his letter to
the Secretary, giving his reasons, bears an endorsement in
pencil to the effect that the refusal to accept was sustained by
the Secretary.
The by-laws of the company showed no authority in its
president to locate the line, and its records, up to May 18, 1865,
showed no action conferring such authority. io withdrawals
were made under the alleged map.
In United States v. Oregon & California R. B. Co., supra,
it was held that if the Perham map were valid as a map of
general route, it did not operate as a reservation, and in Dohierty v. Ncjrthern Paciyfc Railway Company, 177 U. S. 421,
it was referred to as if not constituting a location even of the
general route. It was not authorized by the coin pany, was not
accepted by the Department, and was practically worthless.
It is also true that on July 30, 1870, two maps of general
route were transmitted to the Secretary, one of them showing
a line extending from the mouth of the Montreal River, Wisconsin, to a point at the mouth of the Walla Walla River in
Washington; and the other from the mouth of the Walla
Walla, extending down the valley of the Columbia River to a
point near Portland, and thence northerly to a point on Puget
Sound. Withdrawals along the route so designated were
directed, and so far as the line from Portland to Puget Sound
was concerned the withdrawals must have been under the
resolution. And the lands in suit are opposite to that part of
the line.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

The Circuit Court of Appeals in its certificate states that
it appears to that court "that the case presents issues and
facts identical with those which were involved in the case of
the United States v. 1e Oregon &- California Railroad(Cmpany, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States and
reported in 176 U. S. 28, with this difference, that the defendant, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, is the grantee of
both the grants of land, the overlapping portions of which are
the subject of the controversy herein, and that this case is
ruled by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case above
referred to, unless the fact that the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, by reason of being the grantee of both said land
grants, is estopped to question the sufficiency of its own maps
to designate the boundaries of its grant by virtue of the act
of July 2, 1864."
The contention in the case thus referred to was that the
lands there in controversy, which had been patented to the
Oregon and California Railroad Company, were reserved and
appropriated for the benefit of the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company under the act of July 2, 1864, and by reason of the
filing of the Perham map. By the act of July 25, 1866, Congress made a grant of lands in aid of the construction of a
railroad and telegraph line between Portland, Oregon, and the
Central Pacific Railroad in California. That grant was in the
usual terms enmployed in such acts. Subsequently the benefit
of the grant as to that patrt of the road to be constructed in
Oregon was conferred upon the Oregon Central Railroad Company. The lands in dispute, whether place or indemnity, were
within the limits of the grant of 1866. The entire line of road
of the Oregon and California Railroad Company, which was
the successor of the Oregon Central Railroad Company, was
fully constructed and duly accepted by the president, and at
the time the suit was begun was being operated and had been
continuously operated by that company. The Oregon company filed its map of definite location in 1870, and it was accepted by the Land Department. There was no withdrawal
of indemnity lands on the proposed line of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company between Wallula and Portland, nor was

Opinion of the Court.

there any definite location or construction of its road opposite
to the lands in suit. The forfeiture act was passed September 29, 1890. It was held that nothing in the act of 1864
stood in the way of Congress subsequently granting to other
railroad corporations the privilege of earning any lands that
might be embraced within the general route of the Northern
Pacific Railroad; and that, as the grant contained in that act
did not include any lands that had been reserved or appropriated at the time the line of the Northern Pacific Railroad
was definitely fixed, which it had not been at the time the act
of July 25, 1866, was passed, or when the line of the Oregon
company was definitely located; as the lands in dispute were
within the limits of the grant contained in the act of 1866, and
the road of the Oregon railroad was definitely fixed at least as
early as January 29, 1870, the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company having done nothing prior to the latter date, except
to file the Perham map of 1865, which map was not one of
definite location and was not accepted; and as, prior to the
forfeiture act of September 29, 1890, there had not been any
definite location of the Northern Pacific Railroad opposite the
lands in dispute, there was no escape from the conclusion tha.t
the lands were lawfully earned by the Oregon company and
were rightfully patented to it.
We do not think the fact that the Northern Pacific Company was the grantee in both grants limits the force of this
decision. The resolution of 1870 and the act of July 2, 1864,
were inpari materia, and no reason is perceived for holding
that the act operated to exclude from the subsequent grant by
the resolution.
In

Visconsir Central Railroad Company v. Forsythe, 159

U. S. 46, two grants had been made to the State of Wisconsin,
in 1856 and 1864, for the benefit of two railroad companies,
and there had been a withdrawal of indemnity lands of the one
grant, which conflicted with the subsequent place grant, and we
held that as both grants were to the State, although one grant
had been conferred on one company, and the other on another,
the lands in dispute were not excepted from the later grant; and
'Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court, said : "For whose
