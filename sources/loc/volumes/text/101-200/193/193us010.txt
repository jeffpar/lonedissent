clared, for the benefit of the grantee. It is as though the
United States had said to the grantee: we do not know
whether, along the line of road, when you finally locate it,
there will be six alternate sections free from any preemption
or other claim, and, therefore, so situated that you may take
title thereto, and so we will hold from sale or disposal to any
one else an additional territory of nine miles on either side
that within those nine miles you may select whatever lands
may be necessary to make the full quota of six sections per
mile. When Congress. by a subsequent act, makes a new and
absolute grant to the same grantee of lands thus held by the
Government for the benefit of such grantee, upon what
reasoning can it be said that such grant does not operate upon
those lands ?"
As to the maps of general route of July 30, 1870, they
were filed two months after the date of the resolution, were
not maps of definite location, and included the line authorized
by the resolution. These lands were opposite to part of that
line, and all the unappropriated odd sections so situated,
within the prescribed limits, were granted.

CARSTAIRS v. COCHRAN.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND.
No. 122. Argued January 13, 14, 1904.-Decided February 23, 1904.

That a statute does not conflict with the constitution of a State is settled
by the decision of its highest court.
A State may tax private property having a situs within its territorial limits
and may require the party in possession of the property to pay the taxes
thereon.
Distilled spirits in bonded warehouses may be taxed and the warehouseman

required to pay the tax notwithstanding the Federal statute under which
they are stored permits them to remain in bond for several years and
there is no provision in the state law for the recovery of interest on the
taxes paid thereunder, and negotiable receipts have been issued for the
goods.

By Chap. 704 of the Laws of Maryland, 1892, as amended
by chap. 320, Laws, 1900, the general assembly of that State
provided for the assessment and collection of taxes on liquors
in bonded warehouses within the State. The proprietors of
such warehouses were required to pay the taxes and given a
lien on the property therefor. This legislation was sustained
by the Court of Appeals of the State, 95 Md. 488, to review
whose judgment this writ of error was sued out.
Xr. D. K. -ste Fisher, with whom .Mr.. W. Cabell Bruce
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
As to the jurisdiction: The highest court of the State decided against plaintiff in error as to constitutionality of statute,
Chapman v. Goodnow, 123 U. S. 54,8 ; the point was made
in both courts that the act was not unconstitutional and it
appears in the briefs. N. Y. 0. & Hf. 1?. 1. Co. v. New York,
186 U. S. 273.
Itis not necessary that the Constitution of the United States
should be expressly named or referred to in the record. It is
sufficient if the record shows that a constitutional question was
involved-that the plaintiff in error relied upon a right guaranteed by that instrument. WVilson v. The Blackbird &c., 2 Peters,
250; Saterlee v. 3atthewson, 2 Peters, 409 ; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U. S. 29 ; Furman v. Nichol, 8 Wall. 56 ; Crowell

668.
Every system of law provides that every man shall be protected in the enjoyment of his property, and that it shall not
be taken from him without just compensation. The earliest
constitutions, in Magna Oharta, guarantee that no freeman

shall be disseized of his freehold but "by the judgment of his
peers or by the law of the land." 10 Am. & Eng. Ency. of
Law (2d ed.), 290.
It is clearly not within the scope of the legislative power
to give to a law the effect of taldng from one man his property and giving it to another. Thistle v. Frostberg Coal Co.,
10 Maryland, 144:; --atman v. Greenhow, 102 U. S. 684; Camp
v. Riogers, 44 Connecticut, 291.
The act of 1892, ch. 04, violates the fundamental princil)le
of the right of persons to be secure in the possession and enjoyment of their property if the act is to be considered as applicable to spirits belonging to others in bonded warehouses of
the distiller. The court took the contrary view in -Yonticello
-Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 90 Maryland, 416, and E',?np
v. Fowble, 92 Maryland, 8, because the act, though requiring
the distiller or warehouseman to pay the taxes of other persons unknown to them, gives a lien upon the spirits for the
payments so made.
The warehouseman, however, cannot enforce the lien because
there is a certificate, the title paper of ownership of the spirits,
in the bands of some one unknown, stating upon its face, over
the signature of the warehouseman, that the spirits are in the
warehouse, to be delivered to the bearer of it on presentation,
as to which see §§ 1 and 6, art. 14, Code of Public Laws of
Maryland.
The attempt to enforce the lien before the owner of the
spirits produced the warehouse receipts would, therefore, necessitate a breach of faith and contract on the part of the warehouseman and subject him to a fine and imprisonment in the
penitentiary, unless the act of 1892 could be considered as relieving the warehouseman from these penalties and authorizing
him to ignore his warehouse receipts and to withdraw the
spirits at any time to enforce the lien. But the act does not
so provide. It could not authorize a breach of contract.
The lien also cannot be enforced because no spirits are permitted by the United States to leave the warehouse until the
Government tax of $1.10 per gallon has been paid. So that
even if he had the warehouse certificate he would be obliged

Argument for Defendant in Error.

to pay an enormous tax to the Government in order to collect
the smaller tax he pays the State and county or city. Art.
81, §§ 138, 141, Code of Public General Laws of Maryland.
There is a great difference between that case and this.
The warehouseman has no funds of the owner of the spirits
out of which he can pay the tax, but must pay it out of his
own funds, whereas the stockholder is the owner of an undivided
interest in all the corporate property and assets.
The corporation is also the creature of the State. New Orleans v. Houston, 119 U. S. 265, distinguished. In Commonwealth v. Gaines, 80 Kentucky, 489 ; and Common'wealth v.
Taylor, 101 Kentucky, 327, the statutes were similar but
the constitutional questions were not raised.
While the distiller might frame his contracts to meet the
provisions of this act, a tax statute which imposes upon a contracting party the necessity of abandoning the usual mode of
conducting his business and burdening his contracts with such
stipulations cannot be within the constitutional powers of the
legislature. It is an unreasonable interference with the freedom of contract. Peol)le v. Budd, 117 N. Y. 15; Frisbie v.
United States, 157 U. S. 165.
Mr. 0. . Yellott and -Mr.D. G. .cIntos
for defendant in
error :
As to jurisdiction: The record does not disclose a case in
which a Federal question was involved at the trial in the state
court. To sustain the writ the record must show that such
question not only might have been, but actually was, raised
and decided adversely to the plaintiffs in error. Gray v.
Coan, 154 U. S. 589; Kansas E. & .B. Association v. Hansas,
120 U. S. 103 ; Sayward v. Denny, 158 U. S. 180 ; Green Bay

Gebltardt, 112 U. S. 504.
This court will not declare a state law void on account of
its collision with a state constitution or bill of rights, it not
being a case embraced in the Judiciary Act. XIedberry v.
Oh7io, 24 Howard, 413; Salamon v. Graham, 15 Wallace, 208.
When the decree of a state court turns upon its construction
of a state statute, and not upon its constitutionality, this court
will not take jurisdiction. It is the peculiar province and privilege of the state court to construe statutes of its own State.

etc., 146 U. S. 1629.
A question of state law alone does not present a Federal
question so as to give this court jurisdiction over a state judgment. Ioyt v. Thompson, 1 Black, 518; Congdon v. Goodman, 2 Black, 574; Serial v. las7kell, 14 Wallace, 12; Untd,
States v. Thompson, 93 U. S. 586; Bell's Gap R. R. Co. v.

any constitutional right.
Maryland, 416; Fowble v. Hferrp, 92 Maryland, 630; Carstairs
v. Coclran, 95 Maryland, 488.
A similar statute has been sustained in Kentucky. Conmonwealth v. Gains, 80 Kentucky, 481.
If the contention of the plaintiff in error prevails and the
Maryland statute be declared unconstitutional, the effect will

be to exempt from taxation a large amount of property which
peculiarly invites and enjoys the protection of law. But protection implies taxation and the two are reciprocal.
Distilled spirits are goods and commodities and form a
proper subject for taxation; and a State has the power to tax all
property having a situs within its territorial limits. Pullman
Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania,141 U. S. 18; _Ficden v.
Shelby Co. Tax District, 145 U. S. 1; P. & S. C. Co. v. Bates,

385; fHopkins v. Baker, 78 Maryland, 363; [lowell v. State,
3 Gill, 23.
Having the power, it becomes the duty of the State to impose taxes so that they bear equally upon all persons, and this
can only be done by subjecting to taxation ali property not
legally exempt. Art. 15, Decl. of Rights, Const. of Maryland; and such is the rule, approved alike by economists
and jurists. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Bk. 5, ch. 2,
pt. 2, page 651; Vattel, Law of Nations, Bk. 1, oh. 20, see.

It is for the law-making power to determine all questions of
discretion or policy in ordering and apportioning taxes, and to
make all necessary rules and regulations, and, decide upon the
mode by which the taxes shall be collected. Cases supra and

The construction given by the Maryland court in 90 Maryland, 416, 92 Maryland, 630, and 95 Maryland, 488, to the act
of 1892, chapter 704, providing for the collection of taxes on
distilled spirits, is in entire harmony with its previous rulings
upon similar questions.

Mi. JUSTICE BRnwxn delivered the opinion of the court.

That the statutes in question do not conflict with the Constitution of Maryland is settled by the decision of its highest
court. iMerchants' Bankc v. Pennsylvania, 167 U. S. 461, and
cases cited; Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., 169 U. S.
557, 566; Rasnussen v. Idaho, 181 U. S. 198, 200.
A State has the undoubted power to tax private property
having a situs within its territorial limits, and may require the
party in possession of the property to pay the taxes thereon.
" Unless restrained by provisions of the Federal Constitution,
the power of the State as to the mode, form and extent of taxation is unlimited, where the subjects to which it applies are
within her jurisdiction." State Tax on Forign-held Bonds,
15 Wall. 300, 319. "Statutes sometimes provide that tangible
personal property shall be assessed wherever in the State it
may be, either to the owner himself or to the agent or other
person having it in charge; and there is no doubt of the right
to do this, whether the owner is resident in the State or not."

spirits so in bond negotiable warehouse receipts have been is-
