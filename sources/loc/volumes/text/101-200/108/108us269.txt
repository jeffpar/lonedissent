disposition, and decreed accordingly that the money should be
paid over to the complainant, Hassell. The case is the same
as it would be if the sole question presented was as to the testamentary disposition. The indorsement was urged by the complainant to constitute a testamentary paper. There was no
question as to probate, even if the defendant was under any
obligation to produce one. Tarver v. Tarver, 9 Pet. 174.
Were this the case'of a complainant seeking relief on a will not
probated, it would have been error in the court to have dismissed his bill absolutely. Armstrong v. Lear, 12 Wheat. 169.

JUSTICE MATT'rHEWS

delivered the opinion of the court.

It is urged that the indorsement and delivery of the certificate of deposit, if void as a gift mortis causa, is nevertheless good
as a will of personalty under the laws of Tennessee, and, passing the title as such, entitled the appellant to a decree for the
payment of the money.
But the conclusion is not justified by the assumption, for
a will of personalty in Tennessee does not take effect until
probate (Statutes of Tennessee, 1871, ยง 2169; Suggett v. E'itckdl,
6 Yerger, 425); and, until probate and the appointment of an
executor or an administrator cum testamento anneo, the title
to the fund passes to the administrator appointed previously,
as in case of intestacy, to whom the decree in this case
awarded it.
Tle petition is therefore denied.

them in his pleadings, says as a witness testifying about them, "Icould not
say that I had any understanding on the subject of the nature and character
of the board of. trade deals, whether the property was to be actually delivered or whether it was be settled for," the court rightly instructed the
jury that there was no evidence in regard to this issue which they could
consider.

Action to recover moneys paid out and extended by the plaintiffs below to the use of the defendant below. The second
count in the complaint set forth:
"That the said plaintiffs during the time hereinafter mentioned
were and are copartners in business in the city of Chicago and
State of Illinois under the name and style of Smith & Lightner,
and engaged in purchasing and vending grain, pork and lard, and
transacting a general commission business as commission merchants.
"That on or about the second day of February, 1879, at the
city of Chicago aforesaid, said defendant employed said plaintiffs, as such copartners as aforesaid, to purchase large quantities
of grain of various kinds and pork and lard for him and to make
thereon certain advances of money to and for the use and benefit
of said defendant, and also to make sales of said grain, pork and
lard for him; and that in consideration of such purchases, and
making such advances by said plaintiffs to and for the use and
benefit of said defendant, and for making such sales, he agreed to
pay and allow them certain reasonable commissions by way of
compensation on all such purchases so made by them for him, and

on all sales so made by them for him as aforesaid.
"That under and pursuant to such employment they, said plaintiffs, in good faith and in the usual course of business, purchased
for said defendant, at divers times between the first day of February, 1879, and the twenty-ninth day of April, 1879, large quantities of wheat, pork, lard, oats and corn, to wit, sixteen thousand
seven hundred fifty barrels pork, twenty-two hundred fifty tierces

of lard,
of oats,
thereon
gregate

forty thousand bushels of wheat, twenty thousand bushels
and fifty thousand bushels of corn, and made advances
for said defendant, which advances amounted in the agto the sum of nine thousand five hundred six dollars and

twenty-five cents, and that during the time aforesaid they sold,

ROUNDTREE v. SMITH.
Statement of Facts.
under and pursuant to the directions and authority of said defendant, all of said lard, pork, wheat, oats and corn for said defendant.
"That their services in the purchase of said pork, lard, wheat,
oats and corn, and making sales thereof, and in making such advances as aforesaid, were reasonably worth the sum of twelve
hundred forty-three dollars and seventy-five cents.
"That during the time aforesaid the defendant paid, to apply
thereon, and was credited by said plaintiffs with divers sums of
money, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of five thousand
three hundred thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents.
"That all of said business transactions were concluded by the
sale of the last part of said property on the 29th day of April, 1879;
that on that day, after making such last sale and giving the defendant the benefit, of all the credits to which he was entitled,
there remained due and owing to said plaintiffs from said defendant for such advances so made as aforesaid, and for their commissions on such purchases and sales as aforesaid, the sum of five
thousand four hundred twelve dollars and fifty cents, which now
remains due and unpaid."
The answer admitted the partnership and the employment
of the firm, and said that the defendant had deposited large
sums in their hands for the purchase of options upon representations made by the firm, and further said"that certain articles, that is to say, wheat, oats, corn, lard and
pbrk, would probably and almost certainly bear a higher price
in the market within a short time than they then bore in such
market. That by making contracts agreeing in form to purchase
Auch articles for future delivery at the end of said time above
named he would, without receiving or handling, or actually purchasing or paying for the said articles, or any of them, realize
large profits from the difference between the price said articles then bore in the market and the price they would probably
bear at the end of the time aforesaid; that it would not be
necessary, nor was it expected, or in any way understood, that
either this defendant or the plaintiffs as his brokers should ever
actually see, touch, handle, pay for, or own, receive, or possess
any of the said articles. That the large sums of money placed by
this defendant in the hands of said plaintiffs should be used to

OCTOBER TERMT, 1882.
Statement of Facts.
keep good the margins, so called, upon the said articles purchased;
that is to say, said plaintiffs were to purchase, in their own
names, the said ' options,' but the same were to be so purchased
and held by them for the use and benefit of this defendant. If
the said articles should rise and increase in value the said profits
should be his, and if they should decrease in value the loss would
fall on him.
"That said plaintiffs should so purchase such articles for such
future delivery to a nominal amount of many times the money so
placed by this defendant in their hands. The said sum of money
so placed by this defendant in the hands of said plaintiffs being
equal to about
per cent. of the whole nominal value of the said
articles so to be bought for future delivery as aforesaid, and the
said moneys were to be held by said plaintiffs to protect them from
loss in case of a depreciation in value of said articles, and the
same was adjudged and deemed by them sufficient for that purpose.
That afterwards and during the month of February, 1879, this defendant placed in the hands of said plaintiffs certain other large
sums of money with which to purchase other options, in all amounting, including said moneys so first placed in their hands as aforesaid, to the sum of about three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars. That all of said moneys were paid by this defendant to them,
to be used, and were in fact used as he is informed, solely for the
purpose of making and keeping good the ' margins' so called, to
protect said plaintiffs from loss in case of depreciation in the
market value of such articles so to be bought by them on his
account as aforesaid. That this di'fendant has no knowledge or
information sufficient to form a belief as to whether the statement
in said complaint contained of articles bought by said plaintiffs
for him is a true statement of the amount of such articles
actually purchased or not, and he therefore denies the same and
asks that said plaintiffs may be required to make proofs thereof,
and of the prices agreed to be paid therefor, and the prices for
which the same was sold if it was ever sold. That on the 11th
day of MAarch, 1879, he gave said plaintiffs notice that he had no
more money to put up or pay over for margins, and that he
would not pay or advance another dollar, or invest, or be, or become liable for another dollar in or about the transactions or any
of them. That as he is informed and believes, all of the articles
bought or agreed to be bought or bargained for by said plaintiffs,

Statement of Facts.

for him or on his account, were bought and carried in the names
of said plaintiffs and not in the name of this defendant; that it
was within their power at any time to close out and end the said
transactions."
The answer further charged that if the firm had closed up
the transactions, there would have been no loss, and it denied
any liability. It further charged, as to both counts, that the
transactions were gambling and void.
At the trial the parties were the principal witnesses, and
sundry questions upon the evidence arose, which are explained
in the opinion of the court, so far as they are important. The
jury returned the following general and special verdict:

"We, the jury sworn and empanelled to try this case, find for
the plaintiffs, and assess their damages at the sum of five thousand six hundred and fourteen and T% dollars. And we further
find, in answer to certain special questions submitted to us
by the court, as follows:
"First. Did the defendant notify the plaintiffs, or either of
them, on or about March 11th, 1879, that he would not be
responsible for any money beyond the amount of money they
then had in their hands belonging to him? Answer. Yes.
"Second. If he did so notify them, or either of them,.
state, if you are able, whether the amount of money he then had.
in their hands was sufficient to cover all losses he had then sus-tained ? Answer. We are unable to state.
"Third. If you find that the defendant did so notify the plaintiffs as submitted in the first question, was there any mutual
understanding or contract between the plaintiffs and defendant,
on or about March llth, 1879, that the defendant should -not be,
held liable on the contracts made on his behalf by the plaintiffs
beyond the amount of money then already placed by the defend-ant in the plaintiffs' hands ? Answer. No.
"Fourth. If you find there was such a contract or understanding
between the parties as is mentioned in the last question, did the
defendant, by his subsequent acts, declarations, directions, or
conduct, waive the same and become liable for further losses incurred over and above the money so placed in plaintiffs' hands ?
Answer. Yes."

Opinion of the Court.

The case was brought here on a writ of error. The ma.
terial assignments of error were the third and fourth.
"Third. Said court further erred in withdrawing from the
said jury and refusing to allow said jury to consider the defence
set up by said defendant in the answer herein, that the contracts
upon which the said action was based were gaming contracts and
illegal and void.
"Fourth. The court further erred in holding and deciding that
there was no evidence in said cause to impeach the legality of
said contracts, and the said contracts were valid and binding."
.Ir.- W. E. Carter, for plaintiff in error.

-3fr. C. B. Lawrence, and J1r. FrancisH. lales for defendants in error.
M . TUSTIcE MlILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
Smith and Lightner, plaintiffs in the circuit court, recovered
against Roundtree, plaintiff in error, a judgment for $5,614.46
for services rendered and money advanced by them, as brokers
and members of the Board of Trade of Chicago, for Roundtree
at his request.
The case was tried before a jury, the parties being the principal, if not the only witnesses, and their testimony, with some
correspondence by letters and telegrams, was all the evidence.
The record presents but two questions necessary tobe decided.
It was alleged by the defendant that on the 11th of March,
1879, he had notified the plaintiffs in writing that thereafter he
would advance them no more margins, and would not be reisponsible for any losses on contracts made by them in his
name. To which their answer was a denial of such instruction,
,and an allegation that, if it had been given, it was subsequently
withdrawn and waived by other instructions and actions of
defendant.
Specific questions on this subject were submitted by the
court to the jury, under the practice allowed by the Wisconsin
.statute.
Some objection is made to the form of some of these questions, which we do not think necessary to consider here, for

ROUNDTREE v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

the fourth question and the answer of the jury to it render the
other questions and answers immaterial. That question and
answer are as follows:
"Fourth. If you find there was such a contract or understanding between the parties as is mentioned in the last question, did
the defendant, by his subsequent acts, declarations, directions, or
conduct, waive the same and become liable for further losses in-โข
curred over and above the money so placed in plaintiffs' hands?
Answer.

Yes."

It was undoubtedly competent for defendant to withdraw,
waive, or countermand his former order on this subject, and
this could be done verbally or by actions, and need not be in
writing, and the fact found by the jury that he did so, renders
his former notice wholly immaterial to the issue.
The counsel for defendant resisted recovery against him, on
the ground that the sales and purchases made for him by
plaintiffs were gambling contracts on the prices of the various
articles of produce to which they related, never designed to be
actually performed by delivery, but the damages were to be
adjusted and payments made and accepted, according to the
difference between the contract price and the market price at
the date fixed for delivery. And on this subject he asked
certain instructions of the court, which were refused. The
court also charged the jury that there was no evidence on this
subject which they could consider. An exception was taken
to this ruling, and a bill of exception purports to embody all
the testimony.
The evidence of the defendant on this point was that he
gave the instructions to buy. He says : i, I could not say that
I had any understanding on the subject of the nature and
character of the board of trade deals, whether the property
was to be actually delivered or whether it was .to be settled
for."
It is obvious, therefore, that so far as plaintiff, one of the
parties to all these contracts, which he now impeaches, is concerned, they were not gambling contracts, and that he had no

Opinion of the Coirt.

understanding or agreement, expressed or implied, that they
were bets upon the future price of the article.
The other party to these contracts, or rather parties (for the
contracts were numerous), are not produced, nor their testimony
given, and there is no direct evidence that any of them either
bought or sold with any other purpose than to perform the
agreement as its terms bound them.
The plaintiffs, in answer to questions on this subject, say that
in no instance had they any agreement with the parties to the
contracts made by them for Mr. Roundtree, that performance
was not expected or intended, but a mere adjustment of differences, and they say that actual delivery of the article was
made in some of them. So that as to these contracts, in regard
to which the services were rendered and money advanced by
plaintiff for defendant, there is no evidence whatever that they
were not bon jfide contracts, enforceable between the parties,
and made to be performed.
Evidence was given that a very large proportion of all the
contracts made for the sale of produce at the board of trade of
Chicago, were settled by payment of differences, and that
nothing else was expected by the parties to them, and the
number of these in proportion to the number of bonaftde contracts, in which delivery was expected and desired, is said to
be so large as to justify the inference that it was so in these
cases.
But since the plaintiff testifies that he had no such understanding, since nothing is proved of the intention of the other
parties, and since the contracts were always in writing, we do
not think the evidence of what other people intended by other
contracts of a similar character, however numerous, is sufficient
of itself to prove that the parties to these contracts intended to
violate the law, or to justify a jury in making such a presumption.
It is also to be observed that the plaintiffs in this case are not
suing on these contracts, but for services performed and money
advanced for defendant at his request; and though it is possible
they might, under some circumstances, be so connected with the
immorality of the contract as to be affected by it if proved, they

LITTLE MTIAMI &c. R.R. CO. v. UNITED STATES. 277
Syllabus.

are certainly not in the same position as a party sued for the
enforcement of the original agreement.
Without pursuing the subject further, we are of opinion that
there was no evidence on this subject which ought to have been

submitted to the jury, and the court was right in withdrawing
it from their consideration.
We see no error in the record.
The judgment of the circuit court is aoffrmed.

unless, on a rest made and balance struck for the period for which the tax

the rule in the statute differs from that which it lays down in respect to
earnings used to pay interest or dividends, which were taxable whether
there were actual profits or not.
In'a suit to recover taxes alleged to be in arrear on the profits of a railroad
