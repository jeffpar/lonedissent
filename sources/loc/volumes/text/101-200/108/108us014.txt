OCTOBER TERM, 1882.
Opinion of the Court.

on the facts as found. But here the only exceptions to the
findings below were that they were contrary to the evidence,
and a judgment has been rendered by the supreme court in
every way inconsistent with those findings. The necessary inference, therefore, is that the findings sent up to that court
were set aside and the case disposed of on the evidence. This,
it was also said in Stringfellow v. Cain, might be done in this
class of cases.
As the only exceptions taken in the rulings of the district
court were by Howe, in whose favor judgment has finally been
rendered in the supreme court, they need not be considered
here.
It follows that the judgnent of the Supreme Court of the
Territory must be affirmed.
So ordered.
