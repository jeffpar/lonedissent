Colorado and Santa F6 Railway Company, appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is controlled by the opinions in the four preceding cases. There are one or two differences of fact, but
nothing affecting the merits *of the controversy. The Gulf,
Colorado and Santa FA Railroad Company was incorporated
by the State of Texas, but a part of its line was constructed
through the Indian Territory under authority of an act of
Congress. The figures as to earnings, etc., are also different,
but they tend to the same result as to the reasonableness of
the rates.
A like decree will be entered in this as in the former cases.
