Statement of the Case.

appeal has elapsed; (3) Where the appeal is allowed-at a term
subsequent to that of the decree or judgment, a citation is
necessary, but may be issued properly return*able, even after
the expiration of the time for faking the appeal, if the allowance of the appeal were before; (4) But a citation is one of
the necessary elements of an appeal taken after the term, and
if it is not issued and served before the end of the next ensuing
term of this court, and not waived, the appeal becomes inoperative. Hewitt v. Filbert,116 U. S. 142; Richardson v. Green,

SALTONSTALL v. BIRTWELL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 116. Argued November 24, 1893. -Decided

December 4,1893.

Findings of fact in an action brought to recover duties on importations
paid under protest, which do not show what the collector charged the
plaintiff, nor sufficiently describe the articles imported, and a record
which fails to show under what provisions of the tariff act the parties
claimed respectively, leave this court unable to direct judgment -for
either party.
In such case the opinion of the court below cannot be resorted to to help
the findings out.

Tis was an action to recover duties paid under protest on
importations made in 1888. The first count of the plaintiff's
declaration was on an account annexed as follows:
"BOSTON, July 3, 1888.
"Leverett Saltonstall, collector, etc., to Joseph -Birtwell, Dr.
".Feb. 29, 1888., To excess of duty paid on 432 pieces

. Statement of the Case.

The case was tried by the court uhder a stipulation waiving
a jury, as provided by sections 649 and 700 of the Revised
Statutes. No exceptions to rulings in the progress of the trial
were saved, and the court made the following findings:
"Ist. That as a matter of law the descriptions of iron in the
clause under which the defendant acted in this case refer to
and are intended to provide for such described forms and
shapes of iron in that condition of manufacture when they
are complete and merchantable, salable, and dealt in as 'such
described forms and shapes of iron, and do not refer to or provide for such forms and shapes of iron when they have been
advanced by manufacture beyond such merchantable salable
condition to and for a specific purpose and use as a new
product or component parts of a new product.
"2d. It is found as a fact that the imports in this case were
not within the descriptions of iron provided for in the clause
under which the defendant acted as understood, considered,
and treated in trade among dealers, users, and manufacturers
in 1883 and since that time.
"3d. It is found as a fact that the described forms and
shapes of iron provided for in the clause under which the
defendant acted are, as understood in trade among dealers,
users, and manufacturers complete as such described forms
and shapes of iron when they are completed by rolling and
squaring ends, and it is further found as a fact that the
imports in this case had been since completed by rolling and
squaring ends, advanced by manufacture, fitting, shaping, etc.,
and made complete, ready, and intended for use as component
parts of the frame or foundation of the floor in the third story
of the court-house now being erected in Boston.
"4th. It is further found as a fact that in commercial
designation, habit, and dealing among merchants, users, and
manufacturers, the descriptive words applied to iron in the
clause used by the defendant did in 1883 mean or refer to such
described forms and shapes of iron as are rolled with ends
squared, and did exclude such described forms and shapes of
iron when manufactured beyond such rolled condition to and
for a special particular use and purpose.

SALTONSTALL v. BIRTWELL.
Opinion of the Court.

"5th.

It is further found as a fact that the imports in this:

case could not be bought-and sold in the open general market
at regular prices as and for any of the descriptions of iron
named in the clause under which the defendant acted.
"6th. It is further found as a fact that the plaintiff duly
protested to the defendant collector against the exaction of the
duty paid, and appealed to the Secretary .of the Treasury,
who affirmed the action of the defendant,, whereupon the
plaintiff in due time brought this suit."
Judgment was thereupon renderei-for the recovery of the
sum of $1853.75 damages, and costs. This writ of error was
then sued out and the following errors assigned: "That said
judgment is erroneous in that the facts are not sufficient to
authorize the same in law; and that said judgment is erroneous, from the facts found, in not being a judgment in favor
of the -defendant." The record contains the opinion of the
court, which is regiorted in 39 Fed. Rep. 383.
XI&. Assw'tant Attorney General Whitney for plaintiff in
error.
..fr. William A. .Maury and 3Mr. d. P. Tucker for defendant in error.
31R. CHIEF JUSTIcE FuLLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.

We are of opinion that the fadts set forth in the special
findings are not sufficient to support the judgment. The findings qo not show what the collector charged the plaintiff ; nor
sufficiently describe the articles imported; noi does it appear
from the record under what provisions of the tariff act of:
March 3, 1883, 22 Stat. 488, c. 121, the parties claimed respectively. The opinion might help the findings out, but cannot
be resorted to for that purpose., Dickinson v. Planters'Bank,
16 Wall. 250.
We are unable, therefore, to direct judgment for either
party. CItesapeake Ins. Co. v. Stark, 6 Cranch. 268, 273;

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UN TED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Noo. 93, 276. Argued November 21,1893.-u-Deeided December 4,1893.

In estinlating the amount of duty to be imposed upon shell opera glasses
under the tariff act of March 3, 1883, 22 Stat. 488, c. i21,the value of the
materials should be taken at the time when they are put together to form
the completed glass.
The question wbether the opera glasses should be regarded as falling.
within the description of paragraph 216, as a manufacture composed
wholly or in part of metalis not raised by the record; and, no instruction
bhsed upon that interpretation having been asked of the court below,
this court does not find it necessary to express an opinion on the subject.

THESE were actions against the collector of the port of
Chicago to recover duties claimed to have been erroneously,
assessed upon certain consignments of pearl operaglasses. The
facts and the questions of law involved in the two actions
were similar, except in some unimportant details. The opera
glasses consisted of lenses in a- metal frame, with an outer
covering of shell. The question litigated was under which of
the three following provisions of the tariff act of Mlarch 3,
