ALLEN -v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

ALLEN 'v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.
No. 969. Submitted November 16, 1893.-Decided December 4, 1893.
A Statute of Arkansas, Digest of 1884, 425, c. 45, ยง 1498, provides that "an
infant under twelve years of age shall not be found guilty of any crime
or misdemeanor." The courts of that State have held, Dove v. State,
37 Arkansas, 201, that the common law presumption that a person between the ages of twelve and fourteen is incapable of discerning good
from evil, until the contrary be affirmatively shown, still prevails. A
homicide was committed in May. A young person, charged with the commission of it, testified on his trial in the Circuit Court for the Western
District of Arkansas, in the foll~wing February, that he would be fifteen
years old the coming March. The court charged the jury that the prima
facie presumption as to lack of accountability terminated at eleven years
of age. Held, that, although the accused by his testimony had shown
that he had passed the age of fourteen when the crime was committed,
yet, as the mistake might have prejudiced him with the jury, it was
error.
To direct the attention of the jury to the contemplation of the philosophy
of the mental operations, upon which justification, or excuse, or mitigation in the taking of human life may be predicated, is to hazard the
substitution of abstract conceptions for the actual facts of the particular
case, as they appeared to the defendant at the time.
When the defence, in a case of homicide, is justification, or excuse, or
action in, hot blood, the question is one of fact which -must be passed
upon by the jury in view of all the circumstances developed in evidence,
uninfluenced by metaphysical considerations proceeding from the
court.
The question whether the defendant- in a capital case exceeded the limits.
of self-defence, or whether he acted in the heat of passion, -isnot to be
determined by the deliberation with which a judge expounds the law to a
jury, 'or with which a jury determines the facts, or with which judgment
is entered and carried into execution.
ALExANDEit ALLEN was indicted at the November term, 1892,
of the Circuit Court for the Western District of Arkansas for
the murder of Phillip Hensdn in the Cherokee Nation, on. May
14, 1892, and, at the February term, 1893, of that court was
tried upon the indictment, found guilty of the crime charged,

and, after the overruling of. a. motion for new trial, was sentenced to death. A writ -of error was then allowed to this
court.
The evidence tended to show that Allen was a colored boy,
of about fourteen years of age at the time of the homicide,
working on the farm of Albert Marks in the Cherokee Nation,
some three or four miles from Coffeyville, Kanshs, where
Marks lived; that on Thursday, May 12, 1892, he was sent to
look for some horses belonging to one Morgan, and was
accompanied by another colored boy, James 7arks, who was
then twelve years old; that these boys met Phillip Henson,
the deceased, a white boy, eighteen years of age, with whom
were George Erne, aged fourteen, and Willie Erne, aged thirteen, also white, and some words ensued between Henson and
Allen. In respect of this, the Erne boys testified to nothing
of particular moment, but the accused and James Marks testified to great bitterness in the language used by Henson, including threats and oaths. On Saturday, May 14, Henson and the
two Erne boys had left the Erne house and were going through
a wheat field toward a lake in an easterly direction, carrying
in their hands willow sticks with the bark peeled off, with
which to kill frogs to use as bait in fishing, and when about
half way across the field they saw on the eastern side of the
'fence which separated it from the land of Albert Marks, Allen,
and Harvey Marks, a brother of James, then eleven- years of
age. An altercation ensued, in which Allen shot Henson with
a pistol, from which wound he died in a few minutes. According to the evidence of the Erne boys, Allen took the pistol out
of his hip pocket, removed the scabbard, handed it to Harvey
Marks, and climbed through the wire fence from the east side
to thie west side, struck Henson with his left hand, and then
with the pistol in his right- hand shot- Henson tVice and shot
George Erne thrbugh the arm. Allen and Harvey Marks testified that*Henson and his two comrades came through the
fence on the west side into Marks' ground, and Henson struck
Allen over the head with a stick; that Henson and Allen
closed in and wrestled, and lHenson threw Allen and bad himdown, and George Erne then struck Allen on the arm with a

him, drew the pistol from his pocket and shot Henson, who,
after he was shot, ran towards the fence, abofit forty steps off,
and climbed through it back into the wheat field. His dead
body was found lying in the field about thirty or thirty-five
steps from. the fence. The face seemed bruised, as if he had
been struck in the mouth. Evidence was given that the tracks
of the three boys were plain and distinct the next day in the
soft ground, going in a northeasterly direction in the field
towards the lake, and that the wheat was trampled down, and
there was blood on the ground at the distance of thirty-eight
steps from the fence; that from this point to the. fence there
was a single track made by shod. feet coming over the fence
westward, while, the other three tracks were made by bare
feet; and that Henson and th two Erne boys were barefoated
on that. occasion, while Allen had on either -boots,or shoes;
that there was short grass on the east side of the fence, and
although there were tracks around there it was difficult to discover anything. There was also evidence that Allen, after th6
shooting, ran back to the house, obtained his satchel, went to
Coffeyville in a cart, and thence on foot to Edna, Kansas; that
Clifford, the United States marshal for the District of Kansas,
and one Knotts found him at Edna about half-past two that day;
that he fled, and they pursued and caught him; that Kuotts
returned with him to Coffeyville, and on the way asked him.
if he knew that he had killed thai boy, and he said, No, that he
knew he shot him, but not that he killed him; and then stated
that, there was a man shot in Oswego, and that nothing was
done With him; and being asked what he shot the boy for, he
replied he was afraid they would hurt him with their sticks;
that they did not strike him with sticks, but he was afraid they,
would; that they had bad trouble a few days before. 'It further appeared that he told Clifford he "didn't propose to be
beaten with clubs;" that the deceased struck him. over the
arm; and that Clifford examined his person on the 16th and
found a bruise on his left arm. The evidence further tended
to show that on the morning of the 14th of Mfay, Allen did
not have his pistol with him, biLt, having started with a load of-

hay to town, met Harvey Marks coming down to the farm for
milk, and was told by William Marks (Harvey's grandfather)
to go back with Harvey, which he did, and then went into the
farmhouse and took the'pistol from his overdoat pocket, where
he had placed it two days befoe. This pistol ivas found in
his satchel when he was arrested, and was a six-shooter with a
rubber scabbard on it and one load in it. Three empty cartridge shells, which fitted the pistol, were found in his pocket,
and Allen, when asked by Clifford to account for the empty
shells, stated that he had emptied his pistol shooting rabbits on
his way out there from Coffeyville. When asked on the stand
why, when he went to Coffeyville, he had not gone and seen
Albert Marks about the matter, and told- him what had
occurred, or hunted up Mr. Morgan, Allen replied, because he
did not think it was worth while; "It wasn't my business,
ecause I had done it, to go around and tell every one about
it." James and Harvey Marks were cross-examined to show
that there were discrepancies between their statements on th
.witness stand and statements which they had made to the
'marshal May 21, and which were taken down in writing by
him at the time.
The court in the course of the charge to the jury stated
that it was necessary that he should give "the legal definition
of all these conditions that I have named, that is, murder,
manslaughter, and a rightful killing under the law of selfdefence, called a killing in self-defence;" and after defining
murder and explaining malice, express and implied, and giving
the definition of manslaughter, with comments, all at length,
proceeded thus:
"Now, in this connection, if you believe, at the time of
this killing, Hanson and these other boys had entered into
a fight, had come up and attacked the defendant with sticks,
as is claimed by him, and as is claimed by some of these
other witnesses, and that he killed him at that time, and
under such circumstances, if it was not done in a brutal and
unnatural and specially wicked way, that would be a state
of case where manslaughter would exist, provided the defendant by his actions of a violent character and his conduct did

ALLEN v. UNITED'STATES.
Statement of the Case.

not bring on the conflict of that kind. If he brought it on,
if he precipitated it by a violent act upon his part, then there
could be no mitigation in it; there could be no self-defence,
as I will tell you presently. But if, on the other hand, he
went up and put his pistol across that fence, and jumped over
the fence, and attacked the Hanson boy, struck him in the
mouth, and at the same time attempted to shoot him, and
subsequently in the consummation of that attenipt did shoot
him, and followed up that shooting when he was retreating
and shot him in the back, that would be a state of case where
there would be no manslaughter in it; it would be murder
under the definition of that crime as I have given it to you.
"We c6me now to the other definition. It has been
invoked in this case. And I give it in these cases whether
it has been invoked or not, because we can frequently reason
and come to a conclusion by means of elimination, just as
in algebra, you can eliminate certain quantities from a certain
side of an equation, and thus get at a certain quantity, and
get at a methodical conclusion in a reasonable way in that
manner. Now, if we have the definition of these three conditions, and if you can eliminate two of them, you necessarily
drop down to the other condition as existing, because there
cannot be but one which is true. The conditions are the
opposite to each other, and you cannot find the existence
of any two of them in a case. There is one certain condition
that is applicable to the facts. Therefore, when you have
-these conditions all before you, you can the better say
whether it is murder or manslaughter, or a case of justifiable
homicide. [Now, what is 'justifiable homicide? When can
a man slay another? When can he sit as a judge passing
upon the law, and a jury passing on the facts, and then as
a jury applying the law to those facts, and finding a verdict,
and then acting again as the court and entering up judgment,
and then going out as a marshal or sheriff and executing
that judgment, all at the same time- determining the law,
determining the facts as judge, jury, and -executioner all at
the same time? This is a mighty power in the hands of the
citizen. It is a mighty power, yet it is to be applied when

it belongs to him because it is the law of necessity, and it is
given to him because it is the law of necessity; it is given
to him because at the time he executes it in a deadly way
his own life is either actually or really in deadly peril from
which he cannot escape, except by the use of that deadly
means, or, in your judgment, taking into consideration his
condition, there was reasonable ground to believe there was
peril. That is what is meant by it. It is a law of.protection;
it-is a law of necessity. This is the law you are sitting here
to execute. It is a law of self-defence. You are to execute
it for the sake of society, for the protection of the members
of society against the acts of violence of the wicked, which
would destroy their rights to their property, jeopardize their
liberties and destroy their lives. It is all a laW' *of selfdefence. The necessity is so great, in contemplation of the
law, that the individual can take human life. Now, I will
kive you this principle of the law as defined by the leading
court in this country, and a definition that has never been
shaken by any court, and it is stated in very brief language,
but there is a great deal in it. There are two propositions;
one is a case where the danger to life is actual, is real, at the
time of the killing, and that the party cannot escape. from it
by the exercise of reasonable means, and he therefore, to save
his own life, may act, and- act to the extent of taking life.
I read to you that first proposition, and it is this: 'A man
who is in the lawful pursuit of his business'-that means
he is doing what he has a right to. do, he is doing no wrong,
and when in that condition 'he is attacked by another, under
circumstances whiph denote an intention to take away his
life or to do him some enormous bodily harm, he may lawfully
kill the assailant, provided he use all the means in his power
otherwise to sav.e his own life or prevent the intended harm,
such as retreating as far as he can, or disabling his adversary
without killing him, if it be-in his power.' He is doing-what
he had a right to do, and when so situated he is attacked
by another in sieh a way as to indicate from the nature
of the attack a purpose to take away his life; not that he is
assaulted in a slight way; you could not kill him for that;

ALLiEN v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

the law of seif-defence is a law of proportions as well as a law
of necessity, and it is only danger that is deadly in its character that you can exercise a deadly act against. He is attacked
by another in such a way asto denote a purpose to take away
his life, or to do him some great bodily harm, from which
death may follow; and in such a ease he may lawfully kill
the assailant, when, provided he use all the means in his
power otherwise to save his own life or to prevent the
intended harm, such as retre.ating as far as he can or disabling
him without killing him, if he be in his power. The act
coming from the assailant must be a deadly act under this
proposition. It must be an act that is hurled against him,
and that he has not created it, or cregled the necessity for
it, and it must be an act of which he cannot avoid the consequences; if he can, he must avoid them; he must get out
of the way of the act if he can, rather than take upon himself the responsibility of taking a human life.]
"N ow, the other proposition is a case where the danger
may not really exist at all; it may not have any existence,
but there must be at the time he takes life that which would
satisfy a reasonable man, situated as was the defendant, that
it did not then and there exist, and a man may act upon its
appearance; but there must be an appearance.' A man cannot- act upon bare suspicion of his own mind; he cannot contemplate a state of case that does not exist. If he has that
confronting him which would lead a reasonable man, situated
as he was, to the belief that there was deadly danger, he
could act upon that condition, and he may kill, provided he
cannot avoid what seems to be real danger."
To the giving of that part of the charge included in brackets
in the foregoing the defendant at the time excepted.
The court also charged the jury as follows: " Now, a word
as to the accountability of this defendant. The law.says that
when a child between the years of seven and eleven commits
a crime he is, presumably', not held accountable, yet this presumption may be overcome by proof; but from eleven years
up the law contemplates that he is accountable for his criminal
acts; that he is said to be conscious of right and wrong so as

to be held responsible by the law, and to take away that condition it requires the production of proof 9howing the lack
of accountability. In legal contemplation, from eleven years
upwards he is accountable." To the giving of this part of
the charge the defendant at the time excepted.
An exception was also taken to certain comments of the
.court in reference to the testimony of the defendant.
Errors were assigned upon the exceptions so taken.

error.
FULLER, after stating the ease, delivered
the opinion of the court.
MR. CHIEF

JUSTICE

The rule of the common law was that one under the age of
seven years could not be guilty of felony or punished for any
capital offence, for within that age the infant was conclusively
presumed to be incapable of committing the crime; and that
while between the ages of seven and fourteen the same presumption obtained, it was only prima faie and rebuttable.
The maxim - malice supplies the want of maturity of years was then applied and, upon satisfactory*evidence of capacity,
the child within these ages might be punished; but no presumption existed in favor of the accused when above fourteen.
The age of irresponsibility has been changed in many of the
States by statute, and among others, in Arkansas, where it is
provided that "An infant under twelve years of age shall not
be found guilty of any crime or misdemeanor," Ark. Stat. Dig.
188i, 425, c. 45, ยง 1498, it being held, however, that the common law presumption that a person between the ages of twelve
and fourteen is incapable of discerning good from evil, until
the contrary is affirmatively shown, still prevails. Dove v.
State, 37 Arkansas, 261.
In the case at bar, the defendant testified on the trial, February 13, 1893, that he would be fifteen years old the coming
March, and, if this were so, he was fourteen in March, 1892,

AL-LEN,v. UIITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

and, as the homicide was committed on May 14 of that year,
he was at that time some two months older than fourteen years.
There seems to have been no controversy over his age, and as

to whether his appearance was that of a boy less than fourteen,
we have, of course, no means of knowledge. The court was
not, so far as this record shows, requested to charge in reference to the age of accountability, and it may be, as suggested,
that the matter was adverted to out of consideration for the
accused, .because immediately after the statement on this subject the learned judge goes on to say that defendant could not
be found guilty of any crime unless the jury were satisfied
from the whole of the testimony and from the laNV given to
them "that the state of the case which makes the crime is
established beydud a reasonable doubt." But this he was
bound to charge in any aspect, and the difficulty here is that
through some inadvertence the prima facie presumption as to
lack of accountability was declared to terminate at eleven
years instead of fourteen. And while it is properly argued
by counsel for the government that this was not an error
injurious to the defendant, because on his own statement he
had passed the age of fourteen, yet we are not altogether satisfied that the result was not prejudicial. Where the question
is whether the homicide was or was not done with malice,
wrongfully, intentionally, and without just cause or excuse, it
would seem proper that the attention of the jury should be
called to the youthfulness of the offender, if the circumstances
rendered that fact significant; and since in this case the presumption of the lack of accountability had obtained until
within two months of the homicide, if the defendant's own
statement as to his age is to be accepted, an instruction which
treated himas having been under the weight of full accountability three years longer than was the fact, may have tended
to weaken the effect upon the minds of the jurors which his
youth might have otherwise had, and to which the humanity
of the law regards him as entitled. The burden of proving
legal capacity, as of other facts necessary to make out the
defendant's guilt, was upon the government; and although the
presumption from the defendant's age may have been such as

560!

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

to sustain that burden, yet, as the, court charged in relation to
the age of accountability, we are not persuaded that the consequpnces of want of accuracy ought to be assumed to have been
harmless.
We do not care, however, to dispose of the case upon.this
ground, as another and more serious exception was saved.
The contention on the part of the accused was that there was
no premeditation on his part; that he was engaged in a fight
in which he was struck and thrown down, and, ii the heat of
the struggle, committed the hQmicide; that he was entitled to
make the defence of excusable homicide, and was guilty at the
worst of only manslaughter in unlawfully and wilfully shooting, but without malice. The court deemed it its duty to
charge upon the question of justifiable homicide, and in doing
so to consider and explain two propositions, one where the
danger to life was actual at the time of the killing and the
party could not escape from that danger by the exercise of
reasonable means, and the other, where the danger might not
have really existed at all, but where the appearance of dafiger
was such as would induce a reasonable man to believe that
the danger existed. 'But these two propositions .were accompanied by certain observations which form the subject of the
exception under consideration. The court said:
"Now, what is justifiable homicide? When can a man slay
another? When. can he sit as a judge passing upon the law,
land a jury passing on the facts, and then as a jury applying
the law to those facts, and finding a verdict, and then acting
again as a court and entering up judgment, and then going
out as a marshal or sheriff and executing that judgment, all
at the same time, determining the law, determining the facts,
as a judge, jury, and executioner all at the same time? This
is a mighty power in the hands of the citizen. It is a mighty"
power, yet it is to be applied when it belongs to him because
it is the law of necessity, and it is given to him because it iR
the law of necessity; it is given to hini because at the time he
executes it in a deadly way his own life is either actually or
really in deadly peril from which he cannot escape except by
the use' of that deadly means, or, 'in your judgment, taking

ALLfEN v. VNITED STATES.
Opinion of -the Court.

into consideration his condition, there was reasonable ground
to believe there was peril."
- it will be perceived that the jury are thus told that he who
contends that lie slew anotber -to protect his own life from
deadly peril, or beoaus2 he .believed his life in immediate
danger, must be regarded as exercising the deliberation of a
judge in passing upon the law and of a jury in passing
upon the facts, in arriving at a determination 'as to the existence of the danger and the necessity of using the particular,
means to avert it, and, having arrived at the conclusion
that the taking of life is required, as .proceeding to do so
as an officer does who is charged by law with, the execution of that solemn duty. And inasmuch as the question in
such cases frequently is, not only whether there was actually
imminent peril to the slayer's life, but whether he entertained
an hogst belief to that effect upon reasonable grounds, and
also'whether the killing was in hot blood and attributable to
the infirmity of human nature rather than to malice aforethought, the views announced by the learned judge would be
applicable to manslaughter as well as excusable homicide, the
distinction between which is often extremely close.
In this we are of opinion there was error. 'To direct the.
attention of the jury to the contemplation of the philosophy
of' the mental operations, upon which justification or excuse
or ihitigation in the taking of human life may be predicated,
is to hazard the substitution of abstract conceptions for the
actual facts of the particular case as they appeared to the
defendant at the time.
While it may be psychologically true- that in every sane act,
with, whatever swiftness performed, tliere is involved the-prior
determination to do it, often inappreciably separated in time;
yet when the defence in a case of homicide is justification or
excuse or action in hot blood, the question is one of fast and
must be*passed on by the jury in view of all the cicumstances
developed in evidence, uninfluenced by metaphysiAcal considerations proceeding from the court. 'In view' of such c6nsiderations a verdi6t might-be reached in harfiiony with the results
of scholastic reasoning upon the .nature of things in general

MR. JusTiE BREwER, with whom concurred "MR. JusIOE
BRowiN, dissenting.
I am unable to concur in the conclusions of the court in this
case, and will state briefly the grounds of my dissent: From
the tespimony, anoutline of which is given in the opinion, it
is evident that if the testimony of the two Erne boys as to the
circumstances of th6 homicide is to be believed, the defendant
was guilty of a wilful and deliberat6 murder; if that of the
defendant and the two Mfarks boys is the truth, then the homiciIie, was probably only manslaughter. That it was this at least
is'rractically conceded. iHis own counsel say: "We believe,
from a full review of this record, that the defendant should
have been found guilty of manslaughter; that is the most of
which heis guilty." That the testimony of the Ern boys
was to. be believed rather than that of the defendant is made
certain by the testimiony of the disinterested parties who examined the ground where the homicide took place, and whose
testimony as to the condition of .the ground where the bodyt
of the deceased Was found, and the tracks from that place to
the fence, render it morally certain that no such transaction
could have taken. place as the defendant testified to, and that
his teslimony, and that of the TIarks boys, was false. Of
course, we have not, here to pass upon this conflicting testimoly. I only notice it that it may be seen that the case did

ALLETN v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Brewer, Brown, JJ.

not turn upon any question of the accountability of the defendant; that if the testimony of the Erne boys is to be believed, the homicide was wilful and deliberate, and in revenge
for some opprobrious epithets that had been cast upon him
two days theretofore by the deceased. Th&e was nothing in
the transaction, whether it took place as testified to by the
Erne boys or by the defendant and the Marks boys, to suggest
any question of the want of accountability. The conduct of
the defendant was like that of any other criminal; arming
himself with a pistol, going to meet a party against whom he
has. malice, shooting and killing him, and then endeavoring to
make his escape. Strike from the case the testimony as to
age, and there is nothing in the story of the homicide, whether
as told by the witnesses for the prosecution or those of the
defendant, which suggests either youth, immaturity, or mental
unsoundness. How can it be that there was any prejudicial
error in charging the jury that the age at which accountability
was presumed commenced at eleven rather-than at fourteen?
By his own" testimony he was past fourteen. He was thus
presumably accountable. If the court had made no reference
to the matter, confessedly there would have been no error,
and a mistake in the date of the time when accountability
commences certainly cannot be vital when it is admitted that
accountability existed. Suppose, in a case not capital, the
court had instructed that the statute of limitations was ten
instead of, as is the fact, three years, and the testimony showed
beyond any dispute-the defendant himself admitting itthat the transaction had taken place within the prior year,
could it be said that there was error working prejudice to the
substantial rights of the defendant and calling for a reversal
of the judgment? Yet that is precisely this case. Did this
mistake in reference to this irrelevant matter lead the jury to
give more credence t6 the testimony of the Erne boys; to
disbelieve the story told by the defendant and his associates.
Did it strengthen the testimony of the disinterested parties as
to the condition in which they found the place of the homicide
and the tracks between th at and the fence? Did it in any
way change the chara6ter of the transaction as presented to

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Brewer, Brown, JJ.

the consideration of the jury ? Clearly not, but this court
seems to think that the defendant *may have looked boyish,
and been immature, and that this fact should have been called
io the attention of the jury. Yet, if it were true, the jury saw
and knew it. So fat as the record throws any light -upon his
appearance, it makes against the idea of boyishness and immaturitv. The deceased was a boy eighteen years of age, and
his father testifies that the defendant was about his height
and much heavier, although he. admits that his own boy was
short of stature. When he was arrested by the marshal, the
latter accosted him thus: "Here, young man, I -want you."
Of course, -this testimony amounts to but little, but so far as it
goes it makes against the idea that one who was in appearance
and in fact a mere boy was being tried for crime, whose
enormity he did not comprehend, and for which he was not
fully accountable. It tends to strengthen that which the
testimony of the prosecution, evidently entitled to credence,
discloses, to wit, deliberate action by one who knew fully what
he was about and who was fully responsible therefor. His
counsel asked no instruction in respect to his youth or immaturity, and the general rule is that if a party asks no instructions upon a given ihatter it cannot be held that the court
erred in giving none thereon. It seems to me strange to assume
that, (while the jury saw the defendant, saw how mature he
was, and we only guess at it,) he may have been a mere boy
in fact and appearance; that the court should have given an.
instruction in respect thereto, though none was asked; and
that,'while he admits that he had arrived at an age of accountability, a mistake in the charge of the court as to the
time at which accountability commences is sufficient to work
a reversal of the judgment.
With reference to the other matter, which, in the judgment
of the court, requires a reversal, it is only another and forcible
illustration of that disregard of our rules and the general practice of appellate courts in regard to bills of exception, which I
had occasion to comment upon in the opinion I have just
filed in the case of Hicks v. United States, ante, 442, 453.
Here is over a page of the court's charge which is challenged

by a general exception without any specification of the matter
of law which is objected to. Singularly enqugh, the matter
of law ivhich is the substantial feature of this challenged portion of the charge is not deemed erroneous, is not noticed by
this c6urt, but the error which is found is in language of mere
illustration in an introductory question. That matter is the
law of self-defence, the right to take the life of an assailant to
preserve one's own life. And the law stated is that when there
is real danger the party assailed may take the life of his assailant. No question is made but that this matter of law was
stated correctly. It is, however, held that an error was committed in a question which led up to this statement of the rule
of law. The court asks, "When can a man slay another?
When can he sit as a judge passing upon th6 law and a jury
passing on the facts, and then as a jury applying the law to
those facts and finding a verdict, and then acting again as the
court and entering up judgment, and then going. out as a marshal or sheriff and -executing that judgment, all at the same
time -determining the law, determining the facts as judge,
jury, and executioner all at the same time? " and because of
this question, stated as a preliminary to the laying down of the
rule of law, the judgment is set aside. There is in this no
charge that there must be a period of long deliberation, such
as that which sometimes characterizes proceedings in a -court
of justice. On the contrary, the plain implication is of speed,
for the language is "determining the law, determinin.g the
facts as judge, jury, and executioner all at the same time."
An instantaneous act. It is psychologically true that a party
in exercising the right of self-defence determines what the law'
is which gives him a right to act, and whether the case before
him is within that law, and thus is judge and jury, and then,
as marshal or sheriff, carries that determination into immediate
execution. It may be conceded that the mental action. may
be rapid, instantaneous, as it were; that there may be no distinct separation in the thought of the party as to the respective
functions of judge aid jury, no formal presentation of the law
of self-defence with all its limitations; yet of necessity he
determines that the situation before'"him is one which under

Statement of the Case.

the law, as he understands it, gives him a right to take the life
of his assailant. ie is judge, jury, and sheriff. Indeed, this
is not denied, but it is thought that the language used by the
court is too metaphysical. In other words, the court has stated
what is strictly and accurately true. Yet, because it is abstract
and metaphysical, this court will presume that the jury. did
not understand and might be misled by it. When did it become
a rule of law that a court of error should presume that the
jury in a trial court were ignorant? When before was it ever
heard that a verdict was to be set aside by an appellate court
on the ground that a juror may have been misled by an instruction of the trial court, when that instruction it is conceded is
strictly accurate and applicable to the -case?
For these reasons I dissent, and I am authorized to say that
concurs with me in this dissent.

MULLETT'S ADMINISTRATRIX v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLADhIS.
No. 121.

Argued November 28, 1893.- Decided December 11, 1893.

The Supervising Architect of the Treasury is not entitled to extra compensation, above his salary, for planning and supervising the erection of 'a
department building in Washington, occupied by other departments of
the government.
In this case the delay in bringing suit leads to the conclusion that the
architect recognized the work for which he sued as within the scope of
his regular duties.

Ox May 4, 1889, Alfred B. Mullett filed his petition in the
Court of Claims, seeking to recover for services as an architect
rendered in the year 1871, in preparing designs for the building
now occupied by the State, War, and Navy Departments, and
working drawings for the construction of the same. Other
claims were stated in the petition, but they have since been
