WABASH WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v.
UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE cIRcurr COUXr

OF THE UXITED STATES FOR

THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
Nos. 51, 57. Argued October 23,24,1893.-

Decided November 20, 1893.

On the 10th of February, 1879,-the Council Bluffs and St. Louis Railway
Company leased their projected railway from Council Bluffs to the state
line to the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railway Company'for
the term of 91 years. Together the lines formed the Omaha Division of
the Wabash system. On the 15th of February, 1879, the lessee issued
bonds to the amount of $2,351,000, secured by a mortgage to the United
States Trust Company, to complete and equip the division. In November, 1879, the lessee was consolidated with the Wabash Railway Company,
under the name of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company.
The new corporation assumed all the obligations of the old ones, entered into possession of all the property, issued bonds to the amount
of $17,000,0Q0, secured by a general mortgage to the Central Trust
Company, and other bonds, and continued to operate the property down
to Mfay, 1884, when it filed a bill alleging its own insolvency, and asking
the court to appoint receivers of all its property, which was done. A
preferential indebtedness was recognized by the court to the extent of
$4,378,233.49, which the receivers were directed to pay. The rentals and
interest amounted to $2,175,062, of which $82,250.was for the rent of
the Omaha Division. 'These also were ordered to be paid by the receivers.
It turned out, practically, that o far from being able to make all these
payments out of earnings, they were never enough to pay the preferential debts, and that the Omaha Division was operated at an actual ross,
without taking the rental into account. These facts were made known
to the court by the receivers in March, 1885, whereupon it ordered, in
April, 1885, that the subdivisional accounts be kept separately, and that
no rent or subdivisional interest be paid where a subdivision earned no
surplus. It also ordered the preferential debts to be paid before rentals.
The instalment of rent or interest on the Omaha Division due in April,
1885, not being paid, a bill was filed to foreclose the mortgage upon it,
and when a default took place in the payment due in October, 1885, a
Teceiver was asked for. In the following March a receiver was appointed

as asked for, and the Omaha Division was surrendered to him by the
general receivers of the Wabash system. He intervened in the Wabash
suit, praying for payment by the general receivers of the overdue rent
on the Omaha Division, amounting to $222,075.77. A decree of foreclosure and sale 'of the Wabash system, under the general mortgage,
was entered, which reserved specially all rights under the Omaha
Division, and under this decree a sale was made and the property was
transferred to a new corporation called the Wabash Western Railway
Company. The petition for the payment of rent of the Omaha Division,
-after reference to a master and report by him, resulted in a decree for
the payment of one month's rent with interest, instead of 16 months,
as prayed for. Held,
(1) That the court was bound to take into consideration the peculiar circumstances under which the receivers took possession of and
operated the Wabash system;
(2) That, following Quincy, Missouri &c. Railroad v. Humphreys, 145
U. S. 82, the court did not bind itself or its receivers to pay the
.agreed rent eo instanti by the mere act of taking possession,
but that reasonable time had to be taken to ascertain the situation
of affairs;
(3) That the order made by the court below to pay the rents only after
the discharge of the preferential debts was correct;
(4) That the owners of the Omaha branch, or the trustees of its mortgage, knowing that that branch was in the hands of the general
receivers, might have intervened in that suit for the protection of
their property, and were bound by the order for payment of the
preferential debts; as it is settled that whenever, in the course
of a receivership, the court makes an order which the parties to the
suit consider injurious to their interests, it is their duty to file a
motion at once asking the court to cancel or to modify it;
(5) That the petition of the receivers of March, 1885, and the order of
the court thereupon touching subdivision earnings, was notice
to the branch lines that they must not expect payment of their
rent, when the subdivision earned nothing beyond operating
expenses;
(6) That as the mortgage to the United States Trust Company did not
convey the income or earnings of the road to it, but only authorized it to take possession in case of default, the trustee could
only secure the earnings by taking possession in such case;
(7) That until the mortgagee asserted its rights under the mortgage to
the possession of the road by filing a bill of foreclosure and by
demanding possession, it had no right to receive the earnings and
profits ;
(8) That the judgment of the court below, awarding a recovery of only
one month's rent, was right.
The general rule applicable to this class of cases is, that an assignee or
receiver isnot bou. to adopt the contracts, accept the leases, or other-

wise step into the shoes of his assignor, if, in his opinion, it would be unprofitable or undesirable to do so.
In such case a receiver is entitled to a reasonable time in which to elect
whether he will adopt or repudiate such contracts.
If a receiver in a suit for foreclosing a railway mortgage elects to adopt a
lease, he become$ vested with the title to the leasehold interest, and a
priority of estate is thereby created between the lessor and the receiver,
by which the latter becomes liable upon the covenant to pay rent.

THESE were cross appeals from a final decree entered September 25, 1889, overruling the exceptions of the appellant,
the United States Trust Company, to a master's report, overruling in part the exceptions of the appellant, the Wabash
Western Railway Company, to the same report, 'and adjudging that the Trust Company, as trustee under the mortgage of
what is known as the Omaha Division of the Wabash, St.
Louis and Pacific Railway, recover from the Wabash Western
Railway Company the sum of $13,708.33, with interest thereon
from January 6, 1886, amounting in all t~o $16,765.51, as rental
for that division during the period in which it was operated
by the receivers of the Wabash Company.
At the time the petition in this case was filed, the Wabash,
St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company, a corporation forffed
by the consolidation of a large number of railway companies,
extending from Detroit and Toledo in the East to Omaha and
Kansas City in the West, with a total mileage of 3600 miles,
of which railway the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern
Railway was a branch, was in process of winding up and reorganizing under two bills, namely: 1. A bill filed May 27,
-184, by the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company
itself, wherein it set forth its own insolvency, its inability to
meet various pressing debts, including interest due June 1, 1884,
on its general mortgage and certain other of its bonds; the
consequent danger of a breaking up of its system of railroads,
and the irreparable damage that might ?esult from its disruption, and praying for the appointmeut of receivers to take possession of, preserve, and operate its lines of railroad for the
benefit of its creditors, according to their respective legal and
.equitable rights. To this bill the Central Trust Company of

general mortgage; the United States Trust Company of New
York, trustee of the Omiaha Division mortgage, as well as the
trustees in all the underlying and divisional mortgages on the
various lines of the Wabash system, were made defendants.
2. A cross-bill filed June 9, 1884, by the trustees of the
Wabash- Company, unaer its general mortgage, for the foreclosure of that mortgage and appointment of receivers of the
mortgaged premises.
The petition in this case was fied .April 23, 1886, and the
case referred to a master upon a stipulation as to the facts, of
which the following is a summary: On February 10, 1879, the
Council Bluffs and St. Louis Railway Company, an Iowa corporation, the owner of a projected railway sixty-five miles in
length from Council Bluffs, Iowa, in a southeasterly direction
to a point on the state line between Iowa and Missouri, leased
its road to the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railway
Company, the owner of another railway extending from that
point on the state line about seventy-eight miles to Pattonsburg, Missouri, for the term of ninety-one years. These roads
formed a line from Pattonsburg, Missouri, to Council Bluffs,
Iowa, and are known in this litigation as the Omaha Division
of the Wabash system. On the 15th day of February, 1879,
the said St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railway Company, for the purpose of raising funds necessary to complete
and equip the Omaha Division, issued and sold $2,350,000 in
bonds, or at the rate of $16,000 for each mile, and to secure
the payment thereof mortgaged its interest and estate in the
whole of such division, being an estate in fee in that portion
of the line situated in Missouri and its leasehold estate in that
part located in Iowa, to the United States Trust Company.
In November, 1879, the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern
Railway Company of Missouri was consolidated wjth the
Wabash Railway Company, under the corporate name of
'thd Wabitsh, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company. By
the terms- of such consolidation the new corporation assumed
nil the obligations of both the constituent-companies. Immediately upon such consolidation the Wabash, St. Louis and
Pacific Railway Company enterel upon -the sole use of the

premises demised by said lease, and on June 1, 1880, issued
$17,000,000 of what were known as its general mortgage
bonds, secured by a mortgage to the Central Trust Company
of iNew Yo6rk and James Cheney as trustees. This mortgage
covered all its railway, leasehold, and other property. By a,_
later mortgage, dated May 1, 1883, to the Mercantile Trust
Company of New York, 11,089 shares of stock of the Council
Bluffs and St. Louis Railway Company were pledged with a
large amount of other property to secure $10,000,000 of what
were called the collateral trust bonds of'the Wabash Company.
From 1879 to May 27, 18$4:, the Omaha Division was successfully and profitably operated, and the terms of the leas.e
were complied with. Upon presentation to the court of thb
first bill above stated, filed by the Wabash Company, alleging
its own insolvency, and on May 27, 18841, an order ivas entered
appointing Solon Humphreys and Thomas E. TutL receivers of
all the property of the said Wabash Company. This order
appointing the receivers directed them to take possession of,
operate, and preserve all of said lines of railroad, and from
their earnings pay their operating expenses; the balance due
to other railroad and transportation companies growing out
of the interchange of traffic during the preceding six months;
all rentals accrued, or which should thereafter accrue, on all
leased lines for the use of terminals or track facilities; and
for all rentals due or to become due upon rolling stock
theretofore purchased by the company and partially paid for;
likewise, all just claims and accounts for labor, supplies,
professional services, salaries of officers, and employ6s that
had been earned or matured during the preceding six months.
The receivers were also directed by the order to keep such
accounts as might be necessary to show the sources from which
all such incomes and revenues were derived, with reference to
the interest of all parties to the suit and the expenditures made
by them.
On June 26, 1884, within one month after their appointment, the receivers made a report and petition to the court, in
which they-stated to the best of their informationi and belief
that each andall of certain lines of railroad constituting the-

consolidated Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company
had "at all times during the five years last past, or ever since
their construction, earned more than enough to pay their
operating expenses, the cost of maintenance, and interest upon
the several series of bonds" that were secured upon them by
their mortgages or deeds of trust, and prayed the court to
instruct them as to what they should do with respect to the
payment of interest, as the same from time to time matured,
on the mortgage bonds on the several lines and divisions of
the road as they existed at and before the date of the consolidation. On June 28, two days after the filing of this petition,
the court ordered the receivers, from the incoming rents and
profits of the property, after meeting such other obligations
as they had been directed to discharge by former orders, to
pay from whatever balance might remain in their hands the
interest maturing upon the bonds or other mortgage obligations on the several lines or divisions of the Wabash Company
before its consolidation. Under this order the rental for the
use of the Omaha Division, falling due on October 1, 1884,
and amounting to $82,250, was paid by the receivers. Rentals
and interest on other lines accruing for the same and various
subsequent periods, and aggregating $2,175,062, were paid
under the same order.
The record shows that at the time the receivers were
appointed the labor and supply claims and other preferential
indebtedness of the Wabash Company, which the receivers
were, by their order of appointment, directed to pay,
amounted to $4,378,233.49. It also appeared that the net
earnings of all the lines operated by the receivers were never
sufficient to discharge the preferential debts.
On March 20, 1885, the receivers made another application
to the court, in which they set forth in detail the earnings and
expenses of the various lines of the system up to November
30, 1884, and prayed the court for instruction with respect to
the future operation by them of the several branch lines that
had failed to earn their operating expenses. INotice was given
to the solicitor of the trustee of the Omaha Division that this
petition would be called up on the 14th of April. In the

application it was stated that the expefnses of operating the
Council Bluffs and St. Louis Railway, that is, the Omaha
Division, had exceeded its earnings by $52S8.641, not including
any charge for rental, and, including such charge, there ws a
deficit of $57,538.04. On April 10 the court made an order
upon this petition to the effect that subdivisional accounts
should. be kept separately; that "where a subdivision earns
no surplus, simply pays operating expenses, no rent or subdivisional interest will be paid. If the lessor or subdivisional
mortgagee desires possession or foreclosure, he may proceed
at once to assert his rights. While the court will continue to
operate such subdivision until some application be made, yet
the right of a lessor or mortgagee whose rent or interest isunpaid to insist upon possession or foreclosure ill be promptly
recognized."
The semi-annual instalment of interest or rent of the
Omaha Division falling due April 1, 1885, being unpaid, a bill
for the foreclosure of the mortgage upon that division was
filed by the intervenor in the Circuit Court of Pottawatomie
County, Iowa. The Wabash receivers were made defendants
to the bill. This suit was removed to the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Southern District of Iowa. Another
default occurring October 1, 1885, the intervenor filed a
second petition, and requested the transfer of the division to a
receiver.
On December- 2 1885, the United States Trust Company
filed another petition, in which it recited the defaults which
had occurred in the payment of interest on the bonds secured
on the Omaha Division,. and prayed that the receivers of the
Wabash system, Humphreys and Tutt, be ordered to surrender
to the receivers, appointed or to be appointed in the foeeclosure suits of the Omaha Division, all its property.
On January 6, 1886, the matter was called to the attention
of the court, and the court thereupon entered an order directing the receivers, Humphreys and Tutt, to surrender within
thirty days the Omaha Division to the United States Trust
Company, or to any person or receiver appointed at their
instance -by the Circuit Court for the Southern District of

Iowa, or by the state courts. *There was a further clause in
the order which authorized Humphreys and Tutt to retain
possession of the Omaha Division for an additional thirty
days, if the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company,
or any one on its behalf, would pay to the United States
Trust Company $13,708.33, which sum was equal to the interest for one month on the Omaha bonds. That amount was
paid by the receivers, and there is no controversy here concerning it.
On March 3, 1886, Thomas MeKissick was appointed receiver of the Omaha Division, and on 'March 6 the division
was surrendered to him by Humphreys and Tutt. On April
23 the petition in this case was filed by the intervenor for the
rental which accrued from October 1, 1884, to February 6,
1886, amounting to $222,075.71.
On the same day the order of surrender was made, namely,
January 6, 1886, a decree of foreclosure and sale under the
Wabash general and collateral mortgages was entered. This
sale specially reserved all rights -under the Omaha Division
and other leases and mortgages, and adjudged that the receivers' surrender of any leased branch terminated the lease
as of the date of the surrender. The sale of the road having
been made and confirmed, the receivers were directed to
transfer all the property to the Wabash Western Railway
Company, a new corporation organized to take the property,
the latter company agreeing to pay all claims and demands
",rowing out of the operation by said receivers of the railway property lately in their charge, which have beei or may
be adjudged to be superior in equity to the mortgages foreclosed by said decree." The -transfer of the entire property
was thereupon made to that company, and it has since-assumed
the defence of the intervenor's claim.
The master 'to whom the petition of the Trust Company
for rent was referred made two reports. By the first report, the Trust Company was allowed a rental of $77237.06,
being a sum equal to the interest on the bonds from October- 1, 1881, (the date of the last payment,) to April 16, 1885,
the date on which the court ordered that no rent or subdivi-

sional interest would be paid on lines that did not earn a
surplus.
To this report the receivers filed exceptions which were sustained by the court, and the case referred back to the master
with instructions to report, first, whether the Omaha Division
had been retained by the receivers at the instance or for the
benefit of the mortgagees under the Wabash general mortgage, after the United States Trust Company had demanded
possession thereof; and, second, to ascertain and report what
would be a reasonable rental for the line for the time it was
so withheld. In his second report the master reviewed at
some length the record in the case, and concluded that the
value of the use and occupation of the property during the
time it was withheld froni the intervenor was the pro iTata
amount of the rental provided for in the lease, namely,
$13,708.33 per month; that the intervenor had received the
rental for thirty days of the period of detention, and was
entitled to receive pay for two months more, or the sum of
$27,416.66.
To this report both. parties, the receivers and the Trust
Company, excepted, and these exceptions having been filed,
the court, on September 25, 1889, entered a decree that the
exceptions should be sustained in so far as the report found
that the intervenor was entitled to recover two months' rent
of the mortgage property at the rate of $13,708.33 per month;
but in so far as the report foundthat the ihtervenor was
entitled to recover one month's rent, it was confirmed, and a
final decree was entered for $13,708.33 and interest from
January .6, 1886, making an aggregate amount of $16;765.51.
From that decree both parties appealed to this court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Argument for the United States Trust Company.

This statement of the law is axiomatic, and includes all
classes of receivers. In the case of statutory receivers, liquidators and assignees in bankruptcy, the doctrine proceeds on
the ground that on the election being made, the receiver or
assignee becomes vested with the title to the leasehold interest,
and a privity of estate is thereby created between the lessor
and the receiver or assignee, by virtue of which the latter
becomes liable on the covenants running with the "land."

II. The facts of the present case establish the election of
the Wabash receivers to assume the lease of the Omaha Division from May 29, 1884, to March 6, 1886.

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. WABASH RAILWAY.

297

Argument for the United States Trust Company.

This period naturally divides itself as follows: (1) From
:M~ay 29, 1884, to O.ctober 1, 1884. Here the intervenor's
claim was recognized, and payment of the rental received;
(2) From October 1, 1884, to April 16, 1885. All the
reasons which justified the payment of October, 1884, govern this second period; and (3) From April 16, 1885, to
March. 6, 1886.
With the announcemenit made by the court in April, 1885,
our opponents contend that explicit notice was given that
rent would only be paid when earned. On our side we con-.
tend, first, that the Omaha Division was, both by contemporaneous and subsequent action of court and receivers, exempted
from the operation of this announcement; and,. second, that
the announcement itself never possessed the significance
claimed for it.
Underlying the scheme of the bill in this case, as well as of
the other pleadings, and the orders, petitions, and opinions
filed in the cause, is the constant suggestion of the pressing
need and paramount value of maintaining the congeries of
roads as a system. That may be said to have Veen the basis,
if not the justifying cause, of this extraordinary receivership.
It was not from any philanthropic motive that these leasehold
estates were included in the sequestrated property; nor was
it until a much later period of the receivership that the theory
of an obligation to the public to maintain every railroad which
the receivers had undertaken to operate, found expression.
Estates held by the Wabash Company on the condition of
rent payments, need only have been regarded in the light
of ordinary investments. If deemed unprofitable ventures,
they could have been omitted from the list of property subjected to the receivership, or at any time thereafter surrendered by the receivers to the respective lessors. Only one
conclusion is possible from this positive recognition of the
leases, namely, that the continued operation of the leased
lines was regarded as beneficial to the system. No occasion
exists for speculation as to the receivers' motives. They have
definitely expressed their intention and beliefs, and the result
is spread upon the record. If their persistent determination

OCTOBER TERAT, 1893.
Argument for the United States Trust Company.

to retain the Omaha Division did not constitute an election,
it would indeed be difficult to iinagine how, in a case like
this, an election could be demonstrated.
III. No special differentiating circumstances prevent, the
necessity of the application of the general rule to the present case.
IV. On the theory of a quantum valebat, also, the intervenor is entitled to recover, since the retention of the Omaha
Division inured directly to the benefit of the receivership
property, and to an extent in excess of the intervenor's
claim.
It appears from the testimony that from October 1, 1884,
to March 6, 1886, the net revenue from business exchanged
between the Wabash railroad and the Omaha Division was
$1,551,919.25, of which the sum of $1,123,260.13 was set
apart to the Wabash Company, and the remainder, $428,659.12,
to the Omaha Division: The cost of hauling, the only expense
to the Wabash Company in the case of a greater part of this
business, was, in the estimation of the Wabash general manager, less than seventy per cent, and may not have exceeded
,fifty per cent of the revenue received. We thus ascertain
that the clear net earnings from the use of the Omaha Division, du'ring the period in question, were, at their lowest estimate, and this a hostile one, about $336,978.04, the equivalent
of thirty per cent of $1,123,260.13, and may have equalled
$561,630.06. Furthermore, the retention of the division made
it possible to operate at a profit and pay the r'entals on two
adjoining leased lines, the Brunswick and Chilicoth and St.
Louis, Council Bluffs and Omaha, roads. Such a result gave
practical justification to the attitude of the Wabash receivers
in opposing the surrender or withdrawal of the division, and
in instructing their counsel to "keep the road in the system-if
possible."
While the receivers' reports declared that the Omaha Division for a period of two years and a half barely earned its
operating expenses, when the facts are known, we find that
in addition to the earnings credited to it in the reports, it
exchanged independent business with the Wabash Company

299

Opinion of the Court,

which brought into the treasury of that company a clear
profit ranging from $336,000 to $561,000, and enabled it to
keep possession of and successfully operate eighty additional
miles of leased roads. Under such conditions cannot equity
be successfully invoked to secure a just compensation for, the
use of property which has demonstrated its value ?
V. The income collected by the receivers is primarily
charged with the payment of these claims,: with recourse,
if necessary, to the corpus of the property.
VrI. The decree of the Circuit Court should be modified
by increasing the judgment in favor of the intervenor from
$16,765.51 to $222,075.17 with interest from February
6, 1886.

M . XUsTIcE BRowN, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

Stripped of its complications, this case involves to a certain
extent the same question disposed of by this court in Quincy,
-Missouri & _Paciflc Railroad v. lumphrneys, 145 U. S. 82,
namely, whether the receivers of the Wabash system took
possession of the leased lines under such circumtances as to
charge them with fhe payment of the agreed rental so long
as they retained possession of the lines.
The general rule applicable to this class of cases is undisputed that an assignee or receiver is not bound to adopt the
contracts, accept the leases, or otherwise step into the shoes
of his assignor, if in his opinion it would be unprofitable or
undesirable to do so; and he is entitled to a reasonable time

to. elect whether to adopt or repudiate such contracts. If he
elect to adopt a lease, the receiver becomes vested with the
title to the leasehold interest, and a privity of estate is thereby
created between the lessor and the receiver, by which the latter
becomes liable upon the covenant to pay rent. Sparkawk v.

In 'e Otis, 101 N. Y. 580, 585.
In this case, however, we are bound to consider the somewhat peculiar circumstances under which the receivers took
possession of and operated the branch lines of the Wabash
system. The bill was not an ordinary bill of foreclosure, but
a bill filed by the mortgagor corporation for the purpose of
preventing the disruption of the system, and securing a winding up of the old corporation and the organization of a new
one, to which the various properties of the road should be
transferred. The bill, which was certainly one of unusual
character, purported to be filed not only for the benefit and
in the interest of the mortgagor and thd mortgagee, but also in
the interest of the large number of branch corporations which
were operated under one general management, and WVere~a
part and parcel of the Wabash system. Indeed, the bill
expressly averred that defaults- in the payment of interest
were anticipated, and as -soon as they should occur a number
of suits would be commenced for the appointment of receivers
under the original sectional mortgages executed by the leased
corporations; that under the terms of such leases the lessor
companies would declare a forfeiture of the rights of the
complainant; -that its road woudld be broken into fragments
and would ultimately be sold in small sections, and a reestablisbment of its unity rendered impossible.
This court has already held in Quincy &c. Railway Co. v.
Humphreys, 145 U. S. 82, 101, that after the appointment of
receivers made in pursuance of the prayer of this bill "the
court did not bind itself or its receivers" to pay the agreed
rentals of a leased line "eo instanti by the mere act 6f taking
possession. Reasonable time necessarily had to be taken to
ascertain the situation of affairs. The Quincy Company,"

(and the same remark may be made of the Omaha Division,)
"as a quasi public corporation, operating a public highway,
was under a public duty to keep up and maintain its railroad
as a going concern, as was the Wabash Company under the
contract between them; but the latter had become unable to
perform the public services for which it had been endowed
with its faculties and franchises, and which it had assumed to
discharge as between it and the other company. Its operation
could only be continued under the receivers, whose action in
that respect cannot be adjudged to have been dictated by the
idea of keeping the property in order to sell it, or using it
to the advantage of the creditors, or doing otherwise than
'abstain from trying to get rid of the property.'
On May
27, 1884, Humphreys and Tutt were appointed receivers of
the property and were directed to pay certain preferred
claims, including rentals accrued or which might. thereafter
accrue, upon leased lines. On June 26, the receivers reported
to the court that, from the incoming rents and profits of the
property, they were unable to pay on June 1 the interest
falling due upon certain divisional -bonds, and prayed the
advice of the court as to paying the interest on these bonds,
and as to how they should dispose of the earnings of the other
lines or divisions which had not and would not for the present
be enough to pay the operating expenses, the cost of maintenance, and the interest upon the bonds. This petition was
referred to a master, who made a report on June 28, upon
which an order of court was entered that the receivers, "from
the incoming rents and profits of said property, after meeting
such other obligations as they have been directed to discharge
by.the former order of. this court, pay from whatever balance
may remain in their hands the interest, as the same may from
time to time mature upon the following bonds," including
those of the Oiiaha Division.
If this order of June 28 had been, as the court below seems
at first to have consfrued it, (Cen tral Tpust Co. v. WabasA &c.
_Railway, 34 Fed. Rep. 259, 266,)" "couched in such language
that the inteivenor had a right to rely upon it, and expect the
payment of his rent, until some other order was made," there

Opinion of the Court.

would be strong reason for saying that the receivers would be
obligated to pay this interest as it matured. But upon a more
careful examination of this order, upon a rehearing, the court
came to the conclusion that it was not an absolute order to
pay, but only an order to pay after the preferentialdebts had
been discharged. 38 Fed. Rep. 63. We have no doubt of
the correctness of this conclusion. The language of the order
was that the receivers, "from the incoming rents and profits
of said property, after meeting suci other obligations as they
have been directed to dischacrge by the former order of this
court, yay from whatever balance may remainin their hands."
The other obligations they had been directed to discharge
were fixed by the order of their appointment of May 27, as
traffic balances, rentals accrued or to accrue upon leased lines,
and for the use of terminal facilities and rolling stock, claims
for labor, supplies, professional services, and salaries, maturing
within six months before making the order, and current expenses for the operation of the road. It is true, as argued by
the intervenors, that among the preferred claims mentioned
in this order were the rentals due and to become due on leased
lines, and that there was no order of payment or relative rank
fixed between the pfeferred claims themselves, the court evidently supposing that the income of the road would be
sufficient to pay all the preferred debts. It was impossible,
however, for the court, in making the order of June 28, to
have contemplated that the rental due the Omaha Division
should be a preferred claim, inasmuch as the whole object of
the order of June 28 was to provide for the payment of the
interest due upon the bonds of this division, after the payment
of preferred claims. There is an apparent incongruity between
the two orders, but we think it clear that the object of the
order of June 28 was, as stated, to pay only from the balance
after the payment of the preferred claims, not including as a
preferred claim the claim for rental.
The owners of the leased lines were fully apprised by this
order of the fact that payment of interest upon their bonds
was conditional upon such balance existing; and tihe fact was
that, after paying the operating expenses of the lines and the

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. WABASH. RAILWAY.

Opinion of the Court.

labor and supply debts of the Wabash Company, there was
never a balance in the hands of the receivers -out of which
they could pay either interest or rentals. In fact, the preferr
ential indebtedness which the receivers were, by the order of
MJay 27, directed to pay, amounted to over $4,000,000, .and
the total gross earnings of all the lines of the system, from
the day the receivers were appointed to. the time the Omaha
Division was surrendered to its trustee, lacked over $2,000,000
of being sufficient to pay the operating expenses and the labor
and supply debts of the Wabash Company. The receivers did
in fact pay the agreed rental of the Omaha Division up to
October 1, 1884, to the amount of $82,250. Now, if the
owners of the Omaha branch or the trustees of its mortgage,
knowing as they did that the system of which their road was
a part bad gone into the hands of receivers, and was being
operated by them, had desired to .repossess themselves of their
property, or to object to the order of June 28; they should
have intervened and asked the court to protect their interests.
While they may not have been parties to this order directly,
they were parties to the bill, and were bound to know that
their property, in the hands of the receivers would or might
be affected by orders which the court would make in the
course of the administration of the insolvent estate, and should
have made themselves parties to the proceedings that their
rights might be protected. As was said in 31iltenberger v.
Logansport Railway, 106 U. S. 286, of certain mortgage creditors who had intervened to claim that certain expenditures had
been iiade by receivers without authority, "it did not comport
with the principles of equity for the appellants to lie by and
see the court and the receiver dealing with the property in
the manner now complained of, and content themselves with
merely protesting generally and disclaiming all interest under
the receivership, and yet assert . . . that the other property acquired by the receiver, and now alleged to have been
acquired by him without authority, was subject to the lien of
the first mortgage, and now claim the proceeds of all that
property, without paying the debts incurred in acquiring it.
.A court of equity, however it might act on the question of

original authority or discretion, if presented in season and under circumstances of good faith, will not visit upon innocent
parties dealing with a receiver within the authority of its
orders, consequences which result from the inequitable negligence and supineness of a party to the suit, or of those represented by him." So in .Meyer v. J/inson, 53 Alabama., 237,
350, it is stated, linferentially at least, that whenever, in the
course of a receivership, the court makes an order which the
paries to the suit consider injurious. to their interests, it is
their duty to file a, motion at once asking the court to cancel
or .modify it, See also Tallace v. Loomis, 97 U. S. 146; Post
v. -Dorr,4 Edw. Ch. 1st ed. 412; -2d ed. 425.
It is well understood that, in the foreclosure of railroad
mortgages, it often becomes necessary to provide for the payment of preferred claims, and to postpone all righi of ordinary creditors, and even of mortgagees, to these preferred
classes, and that this is sometimes done from the necessities
of the case without notice to all who may be affected thereby.
Nor .is this aspect of the case changed by the fact that the
earnings on the Omaha Division had previously been sufficient to pay the operating expenses, cost of maintenance, and
interest upon its bonds, and that the receivers thoughUt and
believed sfich earnings would be sufficient to pay the interest
as well as the preferred claims. Various thngs had occurred
or might occur, such as failure of crops, injury from floods, or
other disasters, to affect its earning capacity, and the trustees
were bound to know that the insolvency of the entire system
of which their road was a part could hardly fail to affect the
value of their securities.
. On M'larch 20, 1885, the receivers filed another petition, stating that the earnings of many of the lines had not been sufficient to pay the operating expenses, interest on bonds, and th6
rentals contracted to be paid, among which lines was the Omaha
Division, the expenses of which, not including any charge
for rental, had exceeded its earnings by $5288.64, andpraying
the court to make such orders with respect to the future operation of such lines and the payment of the respective rentals
as. should seem proper to the court: In response thereto, the

Opinion of the Court.

court, on April 16, ordered that subdivisional accounts should be
kept separately; that where any subdivision earned a surplus
over expenses, the rental or subdivisional interest -would be,
paid to the extent of the surplus; where it earned no surplus,
but simply operating expenses, no rent or subdivisional interest would be paid;. and where not only was no surplus earned,
but an actual deficiency existed, operating expenses would be
reduced. to a minimum. At the time this order was granted
there was some conversation between counsel, in which it was
said to be the wish of the receivers not to include in this proceeding the Omaha Division; but it was qualified by the express statement of the receivers that they did not wish to be
understood as promising the bondholders the payment of the
interest on the bonds within a short period of time under the
circumstances.
This order was certainly notice to the branch lines that they
must not expect payment of their rental where the subdivision
earned nothing beyond operating expenses. The Trust Company, however, did not at this time see fit to intervene and
demand possession of the property, but upon default in the
payment of the interest due April 1, 1885, filed a bill of foreclosure in the state court; making the receivers parties to the
bill. This suit was removed, upon petition of the receivers, to
the Circuit Court of the United States. It was not until December 2 that the Trust Company. petitioned the court for the
surrender of the-property. Under these circumstances, we do
not think the receivers are chargeable with the unpaid rent.
It is possible that the Trust Company acted under a misapprehension of its rights, but it is more probable that ti y expected
the earnings of the road would be sufficient tbi entide them to
their interest under the orders of June 28 and April 16. There
appears to have been no good reason why, demand was not
made long before for the surrender of the .property. It is
true the receivers filed in the state court an answer consisting of a single sentence denying generally the allegations
of the bill, and in November following they removed the
case to the Circuit Court of the United States; but there
was nothing in all this to prevent the Trust Company from
VOL. cL-20

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

applying to the United States court for possession of the
property.
There is another reason, however, why the Trust Company
is not entitled to the rental of this property prior to demanding possession thereof in its bill of foreclosure. The petition
avers that by reason of the defaults in the payment of the
rentals the receivers "are indebted to your petitioner for
the use and occupation of the said demised premises under the
said lease." But the mortgage or deed of trust to the Trust
Company, the petitioner, did not purport to convey any of
the incomes or earnings of the road, but provided that if default should at any time occur in the payment of interest, the
trustee should, when requested so to do, take possession of the
mortgaged property and operate the same, and collect and
receive all the tolls and income thereof. It was also provided
that, until such default, the mortgagors should be entitled to
have and to hold the possession of the railroad, and collect,
receive, and retain all the revenues arising from its use.
There was also a guaranty mortgage executed by the
Council Bluffs and St. Louis Railroad Company to the same
trustee, conveying all its right, title, interest, and estate in the
demised premises with all the mortgagor's rights, privileges,
and franchises, acquired or to be acquired, subject only to the
lease. Now, if the mortgage had covered the earnings and
rentals of the property,, and those had constituted a part of
the estate conveyed to the Trust Company as security for the
-bonds, there would be some reason for saying that it would
be entitled to recover these earnings and rentals in this action
before it demanded possession of the road. But where the
mortgage provides that the mortgagor shall remain in possession until default, but when default occurs the trustee may.
enter, this court has held that the trustee can only secure the
earnings of the mortgaged property by taking or demanding
possession. And in Galveston Railway v. cowdrey, 11 Wall.
459, 483, it was held that, even where the mortgage covered
the tolls, income, and profits bf the railroad, whenever the
company should be in default of payment, but a subsequent
clav.ke provided that 4n case the company should be in default

Opinion of the Court.

in payments of principal or interest for three months, the
trustees should take possession of the road, and collect and
receive the tolls, income, and profits, etc., it.was held that,
until regular demand was made for the payment of tolls and
income, the defendants were not bound to account therefor.
So in Gilman v. . llinoi8 & -MississippiTelegrap' Co., 91
U. S. 603, the trustee in a mortgage, which covered a road
with its revenues and incomes, sought to recover as against a
general creditoi a fund that had been earned before the
trustee took possession of the mortgaged property. The deed
of trust in that case provided that if default occurred in the
payment of interest, the trustee might take possession, and
receive the income and earnings of the road, and apply them
to the debt secured. The court held that the trustees had no
claim upon the fund. In delivering the opinion of the court,
Mr. Justice Swayne observed: "It is clearly implied in these
mortgages that the railroad company should hold possession
and receive the earnings until the. mortgagee should take
possession, or the proper judicial authority should interpose.
Possession draws after it the right to receive and apply the
income. . . . In this condition of things, the whole fund
belonged to the company, and was subject to its control. It
was, therefore, liable to the creditors of the company as if the
mortgages did not exist. They in nowise affected it. If the
mortgagees were not satisfied, they had the remedy in their
own hands, and could at any moment invoke the aid. of the
law or interpose themselves without it."
In American Bridge Co. v. Heidelbach, 94 U. S. 798, the
mortgage included the rents, issues, and profits of a certain
bridge, in so far as the same 'were not necessary to pay its
operating expenses and the cost of keeping it in repair. The
question in the case was whether earnings that had accrued
from th use of the bridge before the bill of foreclosure was
filed by the trustee were covered by.'the mortgage and prevailed over the rights of a judgment creditor. In this case it
was said that ' the mortgage could have no retrospective
effect as to previous income and earnings. The bill of the
trustees does not affect the rights of the parties. It is an

attempt to extend the mortgage to what it cannot be made to
reach. Such a proceeding does not create any new right. It
can only enforce those which exist already2
There are a number of other cases in this court to the same
effect. Kountze v. Qmaha Hotel Company, 107 U. S. 378, 392;
Freedman7s Saving Co. v. Shepherd, 127 U. S. 494; Sage v.
-Menphis & Little Rock Railroad, 125 U. S. 361; Dow v.
AMemphis & little Rock Railroad, 124 U. S. 652; Teal v
Walker, Il U. S. 242.
The substance of these rulings is that until the mortgagee
asserts his.rights under-the mortgage to the possession of the
road by filing a bill of foreclosure, or, if the road be in the
hands of a third party, by demanding possession of such
party, he has no right to its earnings and profits. In other
words, there is no privity of contract or of estate between the
mortagee and lessee, at least until the mortgagee has taken
possession of the property, and become the assignee of the
rights of the mortgagor.
On December 2, 1885, the Trust Company made formal
application to the court for the transfer and surrender of the
Omaha Division to a receiver to be appointed in the suit then
pending for the foreclosure of the mortgage. The motion was
called to the attention of the court on December 8, and was
opposed by counsel for the Central Trust Company of New
York, the trustee of the Wabash general mortgage,' upon the
ground that the application should be postponed until January
4, 1886, when the decree in the Wabash suit would be presented to the court for settlement, and the matter of this
petition, as well as all other questions, could be presented
and passed upon. This application for the postponement was
resisted by the counsel for the United States Trust Company,
but was granted by the court, which expressed an unwillingness to permit the further disintegration of the system. No
order was made at this time with respect to the rental. Upon
the renewal of the application, on January 6, the court ordered
a surrender to be made within thirty days, with an option to
the Wabash receivers to retmin the division for an additional
thirty days, on the panrnent of one month's rent, namely,

UNITED STATES TRUST 00: 'v. WABASH RAILWAY. 3j9
Opinion of the Court.

$13,708.33. The receivers availed themselves of this option,
and paid the rent, with the hope that during that time some
arrangement might be made to keep the line within the
system, so that the surrender did not actually take place until
March, 1886. As the rent for the last thirty days was paid,
the sole remaining questions are as to the rent from December
9 to February 6.
The master to whom the case was referred reported that
the Trust Company was entitled to the two months' rental at
$13,708.33 per month. But the court, upon hearing exceptions
to such report, was of the opinion that, while the receivers
were liable for the first month's rental, namely, from December 7 to January 6, upon the ground that the delay upon the
consideration of the motion was opposed by the counsel of the
Trust Company, the further delay of thirty days was with
their consent, hence, that they were equitably estopped from
claiming rental for the second month.
We agree with the court below in this conclusion. When
the motion was called up, on December 6, the Trust Company
insisted upon its right to have an immediate surrender of the
road, and opposed even a postponement of thirty days. Possession of the road being withheld from them without their
6sent, they are equitably entitled to rent for this month.
But the order entered on January 6, directing the receivers
at the expiration of thirty days from that date to surrender
possession to a receiver to be appointed by the United States
Circuit Court, having been entered by consent of the parties in other words, the Trust Company having waived the delivery
of th6 road for thirty days, it ought not now to insist upon payment for that period. Indeed, as the receiver of the Omaha
Division had not then been appointed, it is difficult to see to
whom the road could havebeenimmediately turned over.
As bearing upon the general equities of the case, it may be
remarked that, while the proceedings in the foreclosure of the
Wabash mortgage did undoubtedly result in the detention of
the road from its lawful owners for about fifteen months
without the payment of the agreed rent, the road during this
time earned nothing beyond its operating expenses, and there.

is nothing to indicate that it would have done so in the hands
of its owners, so that in fact they lost nothing. Indeed, it is
scarcely credible that they would have delayed so long to
demand possession of the road if in their opinion it could have
been operated at a profit.
The decree of the court below is, therefore,

Afi'med.

OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 26. Argued October 23, 24, 1893. -Decided

November 20,1893.

This case is not distinguishable in principle from United States Trust
Company v. Wabash Western Railway Company, ante, 287.

'THIs was also an intervening petition against Humphreys
and Tutt, receivers of the property of the Wabash, St. Louis
and Pacific Railway Company, and was instituted by Seney
as trustee in a mortgage covering what was known as the
"Clarinda branch" of the Wabash Railway, to recover a rental
equal to the interest at six per cent on $264,000 of bonds, from
August 1, 1884, to April 1, 1886, which bonds were secured
by a mortgage to Seney as trustee.
On July 15, 1879, the Clarinda and St. Louis Railroad Company, being the owner of a projected railway, eleven miles in
length, extendin& from Clarinda, Iowa, in a southerly direction
tb a point on the state line between Iowa and Missouri, leased
its road to the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railway,

the funds necessary to complete and equip that branch, the
lessee issued bonds to the amount of $264,000, interest payable
in February and August, and mortgaged both branches of he
