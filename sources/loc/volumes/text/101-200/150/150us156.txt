MORSE v. ANDERSON.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.
No. 63.

Submitted November 2,1893. -Decided

November 6,1893.

The verdict in this case was returned December 16, 1887, and judgment
entered thereon on the same day. On the next day ten days were granted
for filing a bill of exceptions, which time was extended from time to
time but expired before April 1, 1889, when they were signed. Hfeld,
that the allowance of this bill of exceptions was not seasonable.

THE record contains, in addition to the record of the trial,
the entry of judgment, and the offers of exceptions, the followino certificate from the presiding judge:

"At the request of the counsel of plaintiffs in the case
of 1Y. C. Morse, J'r., and others v. John Jay Anderson and
others, I make this statement:
"I presided .at.the trial of the case at the December term,
1887, of the court, held at Covington. The trial was concluded December 17, 1887, when the counsel of plaintiffs asked

Statement of the Case.

and obtained ten days' time within which to file their bill of
exceptions. They tendered to me at Louisville, my residence,
a bill of exceptions on the 24Ith day of December, 1887, which
was ordered to be noted of record in the coul't at Covington, and plaintiffs were given Until January 20, 1888, in which
to complete their bill of exceptions so tendered.
"I examined the bill of exceptions thus tendered and
declined to sign it, and had counsel notified of the refusal.
I sent with my refusal a written memorandum to the clerk at
Covington, by way of suggestions to counsel, as an aid in
preparing a bill of exceptions. This was about January 13,'
1888, and on the 14th of January, 1888, an order of court was
entered, extending the time within which antother bill of exceptions could be prepared and tendered to the 15th of March,
1888.
"Some time during the spring of 1888 and, I think, before
March 15; 1888, one of plaintiffs' attorneys, Heon. Thomas F.
Hargis, presented to me at Louisville another bill of exceptions. I examined it and said to him that it did not conform
to my suggestions theretofore given. He replied that he
thought it did, and that he had a copy of my suggestions
which he would send or bring to me, I do not remember
which. He also said, as I now remember, that he would come
to see me soon and when I was at leisure, and we would talk
the matter over and have th bill of exceptions settled. Judge
Hargis sent by mail a copy of my memorandum, but not the
bill of exceptions, that I remember of ; but he did not see me
further in regard to the matter. I wrote to the clerk of the
court to enter an order extending the time to tender a bill of
exceptions until the second day of the next term of the court,
which was May 15, 1888; which was done by an order of
March 12, 1888.
"My recollection is not distinct as to the exact time I saw
the second bill of exceptions, but I am sure it was prior to the
May term, 1888, of the court. I did not see it again, nor did
Judge Hargis or any one else appear before me again in regard
to said bill of exceptions. The plaintiffs made a motion for
a new trial at the December term, 1887, of the court, which

motion was taken under consideration and not disposed of
u-ntil the 3d,day 'of May, 1888, when the motion as to John
Jay Anderson was overruled, and granted as to the other
defendants.
"On the first day of the regular term, May term, 1888, I
entered another. order extending the time within which to
present'a: bill of exceptions to the 18th day of June, 1888, and
on the 18th day of June, 1888, extending the time to present
a bill of exceptions to July 2nd, 1888. - (The term of the court
continues from term to term, as we construe the law.) Since
the commencement of the December term, 1888, plaintiffs' counsel has made various efforts to- have the counsel of defendant
Anderson present and before me, so that a bill of exceptions
might be prepared and signed, but owing to sickness in the
family of counsel this has been impracticable until the bill of
exceptions now signed by me as of April 1st, 1889.
