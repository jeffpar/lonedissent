The two corporations on the opposite sides of this case being
corporations of the same State, neither of them could maintain an action against the other in a Circuit Court of the
United States, -whether held in that State or in any other
State, even if the defendant had a place of business in the
latter. The second, amended bill was therefore rightfully dismissed for want of jurisdiction, even if it should be treated as
controlled by the act of 1875; and it is unnecessary to consider whether that act or the act of 1887 defines the jurisdic-

tion over this bill, filed after the passage of the latter act.

HOWARD v. DETROIT STOVE WORKS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
lTo. 4. ~Argued November 2, 3,1893.-Decided November 13, 1893.

The alleged invention patented in letters patent No. 123,142, issued January
30, 1872, to Philo D. Beckwith for " an improvement in stoves," was anticipated by prior patents and is void for want of invention in not describing how wide the flange should be in order to accomplish the desired
result.
Letters patent No. 135,621, issued February 11, 1873, to Phil6 D. Beckwith
for "novel improvements in a stove," are void because the bolting or
riveting together of sections of a stove was well known at the time of
the alleged invention, and the use of lugs with holes perforated through
them was anticipated in other stoves and furnaces manufactufed many
years prior to the date of the patent.
Letters patent No. 206,074, issued to Philo D. Beckwith, July 16, 1878, for
a "new and useful improvement in stove grates," is void because the
claims in it were clearly anticipated, and because it involved no invention
to cast in one piece an article which had formerly been cast in two pieces
and put together, nor to make the shape of the grate correspond with
that of the fire-pot.

OpinioA of the Court.

dismissing the bill, from which complainants appealed. The,
case is stated in the opinion.
.Mr. W. G. Howard for appellants.
11r. George H Iothrop for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE JAcxsoN

delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was brought by appellants' testator, Philo D.
Beckwith, against the appellee for the alleged infringement of
three letters patent, viz.: No. 123,142, issued January 30, 1872 ;
No. 135,621, issued February 11, 1873; and No. 206,074, issued
July 16, 1878, all for improvements in heating stoves. The
defences set up and interposed were that the patents were all
void for want of novelty and patentable invention. Pending
the suit the patentee died, and the cause was revived and proceeded in the name of his executors. The court below dismizsed the bill and complainants appeal to this court to reverse
that decree.
The first patent, -issued. January 30, 1872, relates to an
improvement in stoves, wherein an exposed fire-pot section,
cylindrical in shape and taperiig downwardly, is fitted into
the upper end of a hollow ash-pit section. This fire-pot has
formed on the inner side of its lower end an annular flange'
on which the grate rests. The theory of the patent is that
this flange, which may be cast on, or made separate from, the
fire-pot and riveted or otherwise fastened to it, is made of
such a width that it will collect upon it a bank of ashes, which
will have the effect of preventing undue expansion of the firepot at the point of junction with the ash-pit. Or, in other
words, the collection of ashes on the flange will prevent such
an expansion of the lower end of the fire-pot as would cause
it to leave its seat on the ash-pit and expose an open joint at
this point. The inventor stated in his application that he had
found that the expansion of the fire-pot is so great Without
the flange that the stove proves a failure; but with the flange

Opinion of the Court.

cast on it at the point designated above, the joint will remain
tight during the lifetine-of the stove. The novelty involved
in the patent consists entirely of the tapering cast-iron fire-pot
with the annular flange or shelf formed on its inside lower
end at the point where it joins the ash-pit, and upon which
flange the grate rests. The single claim is "the tapering castiron section B with the flange or shelf o framed on it, as described and shown."
It was claimed by the appellee that this feature of the invention was so common in actual stove construction at the
time the patent was issued as to be deemed obvious, and that
prior patents, attaining the same results, had been granted
which practically covered the same design or. contrivance included in this particular patent. In support of this contention
-it was shown that a patent had been issued to Benjamin
Brownell, on September 18, 1868, for a soft coal hot-air furnace, in which it appears from the drawings set out in the
record that a tapering fire-pot is one of the elements of his
invention, although it is not described in the specification.
The drawings also indicate, and it was -established by expert
testimony, that this tapering fire-pot had a flange on the inside lower end, upon which the grate rests. At the trial a
model of the Brownell patent was introduced in which- it was
shown that the model differed from the patent drawings in
liaving the projecting flange at the lower end of the fire-pot
formed on the ash-pit, instead of on the fire-pot.
The appellee further showed that a patent was issued to
A. Atwood, May 14, 1850, No. 7356, which has a flange projecting under the lower edge of the fire-pot as wide as the
outer rim of the grate. This flange is upon the ash-pit and
not upon the fire-pot.. A patent issued to Bush & Richards,
No. 171.129, November 19, 1867, shows a constraction like the
Atwood patent, except that the fire-pot is tapering.
It therefore appears in these three patents offered by the
appellee in support of its contention that the invention of the
appellants had been anticipated, that they contain a clear and
accurate representation of the contrivance of the Beckwith
patent; that even if the flange was formed on the ash-pit

HOWARD v. DETROIT STOVE WORKS.
Opinion of the Court.

instead of on th e fire-pot, it was the equivalent thereof, because
it performed the same function in the same way; and that the
only function of the flange would be to collect a ring or bank
of ashes at the base of the fire-pot when the stove was in use.
If there is any material difference between the patent under
consideration and those just discussed, it is found in the width.
of the flange. The appellants lay particular stress upon the
fact that the width of the flange in the Beckwith patentwhich was to serve the primary purpose of permitting a bank
of ashes to form upon it which would have the effect of preventing the lower part of the fire-box from becoming unduly
heated-is greater than shown in the previous patents; but
neither in the specification nor claim of the patent does the
patentee indicate what shall be the width of this flange. The
description of the invention is vague and 'indefinite, and is

not sufficient to enable those skilled in the art to construct it
without experiment so as to attain the desired result. The
width of the flange is a mere matter of degree, and if at the
time of the invention the proper width of the flange to accomplish the purpose desired was known, then the patentee made
no invention. If the proper width was not known at that
time, it should have been described in the patent; but as the
patent is silent on this point, except that the drawings indicate
that the width of the outside rim of the grafe is the proper
width for the flange, it can hardly be said under such circumstances that the vague and indefinite description of the
width of the flange elevates it to the dignity, of invention,
for it has been shown that the stoves covered by thepatents
just discussed also had each a flange which performed the same
function, although not specifically claimed in the patents. We
think it, is obviously apparent. that the patent of appellants'
testator has not only been anticipated, but that it is wanting
in all of the elements of patentable novelty.
The next patent to be considered is No. 135,631, issued
February 11, 1873. This patent is for improvements in wood
stoves, and consists of the construction, combination, and
arrangements of the various coperating devices comprising
the parts of the stoves by joining them together with short

bolts or rivets, adapted to lugs or flanges, instead of long rods
which, when exposed to the fire, are liable to be burned off
several times during the life of the stove. The claims are
four in number, but the.third is not claimed to be infringed.
The general form of the fire-pot is the same as in the former
patent, including the internal flange, which, it is alleged, now
performs a triple function, viz.: collecting ashes, as before;
supporting the grate, as before, and securing the ash-pit to the
fire-pot by means of bolts or rivets passing through holes in
the flange. The three claims in controversy are as follows:
"1. The section A (ash-pit) and section B (fire-box) constructed and secured together by means of bolts or rivets,
and the internal flange b, substantially as described.
"2. The sheet-metal section C,. (body of the stove,) fitted
into the fire-pot section B, and secured thereto by means of
bolts or rivets, substantially as described.
"4. The top-plate or section G, secured to the section F, by
means of lugs and bolts, or rivets, as set forth."
The first claim of this patent is the same as covered by
the former patent of Beckwith, except that the- fire-box and
the ash-pit in the former patent were not bolted*together. The
second and fourth claims are also found in the prior patent,
.except that the parts are not riveted together, and the topplate, or sectibn G of claim 4, has in the older patent an annular depending flange entering the lower section instead of lugs.
In the present patent the flange is shown riveted to the lower
section.
It is shown conclusively by letters patent issued 'to X. H.
,K-eyser, March. 19, 1867, No. 62,961, and by No. 114,614,
issued May 9, 1871, to Samuel Smith, and by patent No.
127,535, issued to I. Whittingham, that it was common to
secure the various sections of stoves together by bolts and
rivets, and unimpeached testimony shows that the Barstow
Stove Company of Providence, R.- I., since 1856, has made a
stove in which a 6ast-iron top and base are provided with lugs,
through which holes are drilled for the purpose of riveting the
sheet-iron body of the stove to the top and base. These claims,
in view of the state of the art, limited the novelty to the use

Opinion of the Court.

of bolts and rivets, and it is tob plain for discussion, or the
citation of authorities, that this does not involve invention.
The third patent, lNo. 206,074, issued July 16, 1878, which
the appellants claim has been infringed, contains two claims,
both of which are in controversy, and, substantially, is for the
invention of a circular grate having a thin closed portion , a
thick open portion, strengthened by ribs, and with a toothed
periphery opposite the open part of the grate. It appears
from the record that a patent, No. 16,315, was issued to Mary
E. A. W. Evard, on April '7, 1868, which describes a grate
with a closed back and open front, and the drawing in the
patent clearly shows that the open front is thicker than the
closed back, and forms *ribs.on the. closed baok. The only
difference between this grate and the one under consideration
is that the Evard one is rectangular to fit a rectangular firebox, while the Beckwith grate is circular to fit a circular firebox. The prior use of the elements contained in this patent
is conclusively shown. The Rambler grate answers the first
claim, except that both the open and closed parts are of the
same thickness. The North American and Morning and
Evening Star grates answer the first claim literally, except that
they are rectangular instead of circular, and provided with
holes in the plate part of the grate, where the Beckwith grate
has none. At the date of this invention it was common to
make wood-burning grates partly open and partly closed, with
teeth at their ends, which serve exactly the same purpose as
the teeth D of the patent. These grates are all used in cooking stoves, and are rectangular in form, while the Beckwith
patent is circular in shape, but it cannot be maintained that
there is any element of invention in making the grate fit the
particular fire-box of the stove to be constructed. To accomplish that end mechanical skill alone is necessary, and does not
call for the exercise of inventive talent.
The appellants urge that the word "periphery " is a word
of limitation confined to a circular grate. However this may
be, it is conclusively shown that the Monumental grate, which
was in public use five years before application was made for
the patent under consideration, contains all the elements of

the Beckwith grate, except that, being adapted for burning
coal, it is cast in two pieces, while the Beckwith grate is cast
in one piece. This does not involve patentable invention.
Our conclusions are, that as to the first patent it was anticipated by prior patents, and is void for want of invention in
not describing how wide the flange should be in order to
accomplish the desired result. As to the second patent, it is
void because the bolting or riveting together of sections of a
stove wp3 well known at the time of the invention, and the use
of lugs with holes perforated through them was anticipated
in other stoves and furnaces manufactured many years prior
to the date of the patent. As to the third patent, it is void
because the claims in it were clearly anticipated, and because
it involves no invention to cast in one piece an article which
has formerly been cast in two pieces and put together, nor to
make the shape of the grate correspond with that of the firepot.
Our opinion is that the judgment of the court below dismissing the bill should be
