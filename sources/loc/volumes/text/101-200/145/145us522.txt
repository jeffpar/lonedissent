TELFENER v. RUSS.
ERROR TO THE

No. 329.

OIRCUrr COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
Argued April 22, 25, 1892.-Decided

May 16,1892.

Under the laws of Texas, for the purchase of a portion of its unappropriated lands, an applicant could acquire no vested interest in the land applied for, that is, no legal title to it, until the purchase price was paid
and the patent of the State was issued to him; but he had the right to
complete the purchase and secure a patent within the prescribed period,
which right is designated in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the
State as a vested right that could not be defeated by subsequent legislation, and is a valuable right, which could be assigned.
The measure of damages for the breach of a contract for the sale of such a
vested right by the purchaser is the difference between the contract price
and the saleable value of the property.

THE court stated the case as follows:

On the 14th of July, 189, the legislature of Texas passed
an act "to provide for the sale of a portion of the unappropriated public lands of the State," and the investment of the
proceeds. The following are the sections of the act which
bear upon this case:
"SEc. 2. That any person, firm or corporation, desiring to
purchase any of-the unappropriated lands herein set apart and
reserved for sale, may do so by causing the tract or tracts
which such.person, firm or corporation desire to purchase, to
be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor 'ofthe county
or district in which said land is situated.
"SEC.' 3. It shall be the duty of the surveyor, to whom application is made by responsible parties, to survey the lands
designated in said application within three months from the
date there6f, and within sixty days after said survey, to cer-tify to, record and map the field-notes of said survey; and he
shall also, witnin the said sixty days, return to and file the
same in the general land office, as required by law in the
other cases."

TELFEXER v. RUSS.
Statement of the Case.

"SEc. 5. Within sixty days after the return to and filing in
the general land office of the surveyor's certificate, map, and
field-notes of the land desired to be purchased, it shall be the
'right of the person, firm or corporation who has had the same
surveyed to pay or cause to be paid into the treasury of the
State the purchase money therefor at the rate of fifty cents
per acre, and upon the presentation to the commissioner of
the general land office of the receipt of the state treasurer for
such purchase money, said commissioner shall issue to said
person, firm or corporation a patent for the tract or tracts of
land so conveyed and paid for."
"SEC. 7. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of the
general land office to give- such general and specific instructions to the surveyors in relation to the survey of the public
lands under the provisions of this act as may best subserve all
interests of the State and carry into force and effect the intent
and purposes of this act,
"SEC. 8. After the survey of any of the publicÂ°d-main
authorized by this act, it shall not be lawful for any person to
file or locate upon the land so surveyed, and such file or location shall be utterly null and void.
"SEC. 9. Should any applicant for the purchase of public
land fail, refuse or neglect to pay for the same at the rate of
fifty cents per acre within the time prescribed in section 5 of
this act, he shall forfeit all right-thereto and shall not thereafter be allowed to purchase the same, but the land so surveyed may be sold by the commissioner of the general land
office to any other person, firm or corporation who shall pay
into the treasury the purchase money therefor."
An amendment of the act in 1881 extended its provisions to
unappropriated land in other counties than those originally
mentioned. On the 22d of January, 1883, both acts were re-.
pealed. Whilst the fnist of these apts was in force the plaintiff below, the defendant ]n error here, claimed to have acquired a valuable and transferable interest in a large body of
these lands, exceeding in extent a million of acres, and to have
s6ld the lands to the defendant below, Count Joseph Telfener,
at twenty-five cents an acre. To recover, damages for breach

of this alleged contract, and a supplementary contract of ihe
same date accompanying it, the present action was brought in
a state court of Texas.
The petition of the plaintiff, the first pleading in the action,
alleges that the plaintiff is a resident of Texas, and that the
defendant is not a resident of the State, but a transient person
then temporarily in the State of New York; that on the first
day of November the plaintiff was the sole owner of a certain
valuable, valid and transferable interest in the whole of a certain body of land containing, as subsequently ascertained by
survey, 1813 tracts of 640 acres each, being an aggregate of
1,160,320 acres, situated in the county of El. Paso, in the State
of Texas, and forming part of what is known as the Pacific
reservation; and that he had become such owner by comply.ing with the requirements of the act of July 14, 1879, mentioned above and of the amendatory act of-March 11, 1881.
The petition then details the mode in which the plaintiff became such owner, namely, that during the month of
October, 1882, being a responsible party, and intending to
purchase the said body of land Which was subject to sale
under the terms of the acts mentioned, he-applied to the surveyor of the county of El Paso for the purchase and survey of
the eighteen hundred and thirteen tracts, describing them by
metes and bounds as a whole; that he made the application
pursuant to the instructions of the commissioner of the general land office of the State to the surveyors of the counties
and land districts containing lands subject to sale ; that the
application was filed and recorded in the office of the surveyor
inOctober, 1882; that, having thus made due application for
the purchase and survey of said lands, he was, on the first day
of November, 1882, about to have them surveyed into tracts
of 640 acres each, when the defendant, by his duly authorized
agents, applied to him to purchase his interest in the lands
thus acquired.; and that thereupon the plaintiff, not yet having paid to the State of Texas the fifty cents per acre, to
which the State was entitled, and the defendant offering to
assume such payment and desiring simply to contract with
the plaintiff for the purchase and assignment of his right to

The petition alleges that by the contracts set forth the
plaintiff sold, and agreed to assign to the defendant, and the
defendant purchased and agreed to accept from the plaintiff,
at the price of twenty-five cents an acre, a conveyance of
plaintiffis application to purchase of the State 1813 tracts of
land, being part of the -Pacific reservation, and that at the
time the plaintiff was able- and authorized to make the contracts and to execute and deliver a proper and valid assignment and transfer of his said application and of all his rights,
titles and interests thereunder to the defendant.
The petition also contains various allegations as to arrangements made by the parties for ascertaining whether or not
the application of the plaintiff for the purchase of the lands had

TELFENER v. RUSS.
Statemeht of the Case.

been regularly and properly made, and a6cording to the provisions of the laws of Texas, and among others that such conformity being shown as would entitle the plaintiff to -become
the purchaser, the defendant agreed to pay him ninety per
cent of the purchase price stipulated. It also alleges the readiness of the plaintiff to fuuy comply with the contract and thefailure of the defendant in all things to comply with the same
on his part, to the damage of the :plaintiff of four hundred
thousand dollars.
The plaintiff therefore prayed judgment for the sum of
tiventy-five cents per acre alleged to be due to him for said one
million one hundred sixty thousand three hundred and twenty
acres, and also for the sum -of fifty-eight thousand and sixteen
dollars alleged to be due him on the supplementary contract
contained in Exhibit NS,together with legal interest on both
sumas, and for such further judgment and decree as on the
hearing might seem equitable and just.
The defendant appeared to the action, and for answer said:
First, that the petition was insufficient in law, wherefore he
prayed judgment; second, that he denied all and singular the
allegations of the petition; and, third, that he denied that he
executed, by himself or agent, the instruments, or either of
them, annexed to the petition.
The case was subsequently, on application of the defencLant,
removed from the state court o ;the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Western District of Texas, and there
the defendant had leave to file an amended answer, which
averred, 1st, that the petition was insufficient in law to require
him to answer it, upon which the judgment of the court was
prayed; 2d, that the so-called Pacific reservation was not subject to sale by'the State of Texas; and, 3d, that if Baccarisse,
mentioned in the petition as the agent of the defendant, ever
had any authority to -negotiate in regard to -the purchase
of lands in Teia s, it-was Ifierely as an employ6 under one
Wescott, and his employment was merely to inquire and
ascertain whether options or conditional contracts could be
obtained by which parties would agree to sell lands in that
State subject to the inspection and approval of an expert or

Statement of the Case.

inspector sent out by a London syndicate for that purpose,
such contract not to be final and binding unless ratified by
the defendant after the approval of the expert; that the defendant never knew, until shortly before the present suit was
instituted, that Baccarisse had attempted to execute any contract, as set up in the petition; and that he never authorized
him to make any contracts, nor ever approved or ratified any
made by him. This answer was again amended, by leave of
the court, by the addition of a frother defence, in which the
defendant averred that if any such contract or contracts as
are referred to and exhibited with the petition, were entered
into by hig authority or ratified - by him, which is denied, the
same were without any consideration, or, if there was any
valid consideration therefor, the same failed in this, that the
law which permitted the purchase of the lands was repealed
before the steps required thereby to obtain title, or any vested
interest therein, could have been or were taken, and by reason
thereof all right, if any, which defendant acquired or could
have acquired under the contracts were lost to him.
The case was tried by the court with a jury. Among other
things, it was contended by the defendanz that the plaintiff
had no assignable interest in the lands described, but the court,
of its own motion, charged the jury that if this were a rule
when nothing but an application had been filed, the Supreme
Court of the State had decided that, after surveys, a right did
attach which could not be divested by adverse legislation, and
that, in that case, all the surveys, excepting four mentioned,
were made before the first day of November, 1882, the date
of the contract of sale. To this tuling an exception was taken.
It was also contended that the plaintiff, even if the contracts
had been originally valid, had suffered no pecuniary damages
from their breach; and the court was requested to charge the
jury that the measure of damages would be the difference
between twenty-five cents per acre, for as many acres as were
embraced in the plaintiff's application to the county surveyor
to purchase, and the diminished market value below that figure
on the 15th of November, 1882; that no special damages could
be recovered unless they were alleged and proved, and as such

TELFENER v. RUSS.
Opinion of the Court.

damages had neither been alleged nor pr6ved the jury should
find for the defendant; but the court refused thus to charge,
and instructed the jury that if the contracts were made as
stated, and the plaintiff had complied with the laws of Texas
respecting the application for the lands, he was entitled to
recover twenty-five cents an acre for all the lands of which a
survey was made. - To this ruling an exception was taken.
The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $384,809.38.
A remittitur of $400.38 having bebn made therefrom, judgment was entered for the balance, namely, $384,409, the same
to draw interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum. To
review this judgment the case is brought here on writ of
error.

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Two questions were presented for our consideration on the
argument of this case - 1st, whether the plaintiff below, the
defendant in error here, acqaired any assignable interest in
the real property described in the contract upon which the
action is brought; 2d, assuming that he had an assignable
interest, whether the rule for the measure of damages for breach
of the contract for such interest by the defendant was correctly
stated to the. jury by the court.
1. The State of Texas opened its unappropriated lands for
sale on the most liberal terms. Any person, firm or corporation
desiring to purchase any portion of the lands might do so by
applying to have the same surveyed by the authorized public
surveyor of the county or district in which it was situated. It
was made the duty of the surveyor to whom such application
was made by a responsible party, to survey the land designated, within three months thereafter, and within sixty days
after the survey to certify and record a map and field-notes of

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

the*survey, and return and file them in the General Land
Office of the State. Within sixty days after the return and
filing of these papers in the General Land Office iti was the
right of the person, firma or corporation that had had the survey made to pay or cause to be paid into the treasury of the
State the purchase money at the rate of fifty cents per acre.
Upon presentation to the Commissioner of the General Land
Office of the receipt of the state treasurer of the purchase
money, the Commissioner was to issue to the person, firm or
corporation a patent for the tract or tracts surveyed and paid
for. And the statute declared that if any applicant for the
purchase of public land refused or neglected to pay for the
same at the rate of fifty cents per acre, within the time prescribed in the 5th section, he should forfeit all rights thereto
and should not thereafter be allowed to purchase the same,
but the land surveyed might be sold by the Commissioner of
the General Land Office to any other person, firm or corporation that should pay into the treasury the purchase money
therefor.
It will thus be seen that an applicant, under the laws of
Texas, for the purchase, of a p6rtion of its unappropriated
lands, could acquire no vested interest in the land applied for,
that is, no legal title to it, until the purchase price was paid
and the patent of the State was issued to him. If the price was
not paid within sixty days after the return to the General
Land Office of a map of the land desired and the field-notes
of its survey, he forfeited all right to the land, and was not
thereafter allowed to purchase it. He had, however, the right
to complete the purchase and secure a patent within the
prescribed period, after the map and field-nbtes of the survey
were filed -in the General Land Office, which is designated, in
the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State as a vested
right that could not be defeated by subsequent legislation.
Whether this vested right for the limited period prescribed
was assignable to others without the consent of the state
authorities, neither the statutes of the State nor the deciÂ§ions
of its courts inform us definitely. It would seem that if a
right to purchase land for however short a period is vested in

TELFENER v. RUSS.
Opinion of the Court.

one, it is a valuable right, and is, in that sense, property, and
in the absence of express prohibition would be therefore assignable. Such is apparently the import of lauguhge used
by the Supreme Court of the State in some of its decisions.
White v. -Martin,66 Texas, 340 ; Jumbo Cattle Co. v. B acon,
79 Texas, 5.
In this case the purchase price of the land applied for by
the plaintiff was never paid or tendered to the State by him,
and on January 22, 1883, both of the laws of Texas -that of
July 14, 1879, and that of March 11, 1881, were repealed.
But it is contended that previous to such repeal he had acquired a right to complete the purchase of the land by paying its price and thus obtaining a patent for it, and while
possessing that right the alleged contract was made with the
defendant for its sale to him.
2. We will not, however, rest our decision upon the assignability of the right to purchase alleged to have been thus
made, without the assent of the state authorities, as there is
another and clear ground for the disposition of the case, in
the instruction of the court to the jury upon the measure of
damages for the alleged breach of the contract, which was
that, if the contract was made as stated, and the plaintiff had
complied with the laws of Texas respecting the application
for the land, he was entitled to recover of the defendant
twenty-five cents an acre - the full contract price-for all
the land of which a survey was made. In this instruction the
Circuit Court erred.
Assuming that the plaintiff had acquired a vested right to
complete the proceedings for the purchase of the land desired,
and to secure a patent for it, and that such right was not
personal to him but was transferable to another without the
assent of the state authorities, he did not show that he had
suffered any damages by the failure of the defendant to comply with the contract for the right to purchase the land. On
the 15th of IN6vember he possessed all the right to the land
which he ever possessed, and, assuming that the defendant
then failed to make the payment which he had agreed to
make, all the damages suffered by'the plaintiff was the dif-

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

ference between the value of the right, as stipulated to be
paid, and the amount which could then have been obtained
on its sale. The measure of damages for breach of a contract of sale of land by the purchaser is the difference between the contract price and the salable value of the property.
That is the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of Texas in
Xempner v. Hfeidenheiner, 65 Texas, 587. That court also
adds that the salable value "may be fixed by a fair resale,
after notice to the party to be bound by the price as the
value, within a reasonable time after the breach." In that
case it was also held that, where no sale was made, the
plaintiff was only entitled to. recover the difference between
the market value at the date of the defendant's breach and
the price he had agreed to pay, and that the duty devolved
upon the plaintiff to establish these factors in the measure of
damages. The same rule as to the measure of damages upon
a breach of a contract for the sale of lands was held to be the
proper one by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Old
Colony. Railroad v. -Evans,6 Gray, 25, 36, after considering
numerous authorities on the subject. A similar rule prevails
in Pennsylvania. Bowser v. Cessna, 62 Penn. St. 148, 151.
The same rule must apply where the contract is not for the
land but for a right to purchase the land. The measure of
damages must be the difference between the contract price
and the salable value of the right when payment was to be
made.
In the present case no evidence was produced to show the
value on the 15th of November of the right of the plaintiff
which he had sold to the defendant, nor was there any evidence produced as to the amount for which he could have
sold to others that right; there was no evidence, therefore,
for the estimate of damages at that time upon which the
jury could have based a verdict. If anything could then
have been obtained from the sale of that right, and the contract had been valid and binding, it was the duty of the
plaintiff to make the sale when the defendant defaulted in
his contract, and thus to have subjected him to as little loss
as uracticable. Pnt no such sale was attempted, and no evi-
