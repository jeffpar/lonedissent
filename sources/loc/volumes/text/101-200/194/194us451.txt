DAVIS v. MILLS.
CERTIFICATE *FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
SECOND

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

No. 235. Argued April 19, 1904.-Decided May 16, 1904.

Section 554 of the Montana Code of Civil Procedure, limiting actions to
enforce a special statutory director's liability to three years, applies to
liabilities incurred before its passage under a differeit statute and goes
with them as a qualification when they are sued upon in other States.
If such a statute of limitations allows over a year in which to sue upon an
existing cause of action it is sufficient. A statute of limitations may bar
an existing right as well as the remedy.

THIS case came here on a certificate of which the following
is the material portion:
"The plaintiff is a citizen of Montana and- the owner by
assignment of three causes of action (for goods sold and on a
promissory note) against the Obelisk Mining and Concentrating Company, a Montana corporation. The indebtedness of
the company upon these causes of action accrued July 31,
1892, July 1, 1892, and December 12, 1892, respectively The
defendants are and always have been citizens and residents of
Connecticut, and at all the times mentioned in the complaint
were trustees of the said Obelisk Mining Company. The statutes of Montana provide that within twenty days from the
first day of September every such company shall annually file
a specified report, and that if it 'shall fail to do so, all the
trustees of the company shall be jointly and severally liable

for all of the debts of the company then existing, and for all
that shall be contracted before such report shall be made.'
Section 460 of chapter 25 of the fifth division, Compiled Statutes of Montana, which was in force when the cause of action
arose. Re~nacted as section 451 of the Civil Code of Montana, which went into effect July 1, 1895.
"The Obelisk Company failed to file -certain of the required
reports and the causes of action sued upon here, against the
defendants as trustees to recover debts of the company, accrued September 22, 1893, or prior thereto. This action was
brought to enforce the joint and several liability of the defendants under the statute on July 30, 1897.
"When the cause of action accrued the Compiled Statutes
of Montana contained these sections:
"'SEc. 45. 1. In an action for a penalty or forfeiture, when
the action is given to an individual, or to an individual and the
Territory, except where the statute imposing it prescribes a
different limitation; 2, an action against a sheriff or other
officer for the escape of a prisoner arrested or imprisoned on
civil process shall be 'commenced within one year.'
"'SEc. 50. If when the cause of action shall accrue against
a person he is out of the Territory, the action may be commenced within the time herein limited, after his return to the
Territory; and if after the cause of action shall have accrued
he depart from this Territory, the time of his absence shall not
be a part of the time limited for the commencement of the
action.'
"Both of those sections were repealed by the Code of Civil
Procedure, section 3482, which Went into effect July 1, 1895.
On the last-named date the Civil Code. of Montana went into
effect, containing section 451 above cited. The Code of Civil
Procedure contains a separate title, numbered II, and containing four chapters (sections 470 to 559), which deals exhaustively with 'the time of commencing actions.' It con.
tains these sections:
"'SEc. 515. Within two years.:

194 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"'1. An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture,
"when the action is given to an individual, or to an individual
and the State, except when the statute imposing it prescribes
a different limitation." '
'SEc. 541. If, when the cause of action accrues against a
person, he is out of the State, the action may be commenced
within the term herein limited, after his return to the State,
and if, after the cause of action accrues, he departs from the
State, the time of his absence is not part of the time limited
for the commencement of the action.'
"'SEc. 554. This title does riot affect actions against directors or stockholders of a corporation, to recover a penalty
or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce a liability created by law;
but such actions must be brought within three years after the
discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which the
penalty of forfeiture attached or the liability created (sic).'
"Upon the facts above set forth, the question of law concerning which this court desires the instruction of the Shpreme
Court, for its proper decision, is:
" 'May a defendant in an action of the kind specified in
section 554 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Montana avail
of the limitation therein prescribed, when the action is brought
against him in the court of another State?'
Mr. John A. Shelton, with whom Mr. T. J. Walsh was on
the brief, for Davis.
Mr. William Waldo Hyde, with whom Mr. Charles E. Perkins was on the brief, for Mills.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion Di the court.
The general theory on which an action is maintained upon
a cause which accrued in another jurisdiction is that the liability is an obligatio, which, having been attached to the person
by the law then having that person within its power, will be

treated by other countries as accompanying the person when
brought before-their courts. But, as the source of the obligation is the foreign law, the defendant, generally speaking,
is entitled to the benefit of whatever conditions and limitations
the foreign law creates. Slater v. Mexican National Railroad,
194 U. S. 120. It is true that this general proposition is qualified by the fact that the ordinary limitations of actions are
treated as laws of procedure and as belonging to the lex Jori,
as affecting the remedy only and not the right. But in cases
where it has been possible to escape from that qualification
by a reasonable distinction courts have been willing to treat
limitations of time as standing like other limitations and cutting down the defendant's liability wherever he is sued. The
common case is where a statute creates a new liability and in
the same section or in the same act limits the time within
which it can be enforced, whether using words of condition
or not. The Harrisburg,119 U. S. 199. But the fact that the
limitation is contained in the same section or the same statute
is material only as bearing on construction. It is merely a
ground for saying that the limitation goes to the right created
and accompanies the obligation everywhere. The same conclusion would be reached if the limitation was in a different
statute, provided it was directed to the newly created liability
so specifically as to warrant saying that it qualified the right.
If, then, the only question were one
of construction and as
to liabilities subsequently incurred, it would be a comparatively easy matter to say that section 554 of the Montana Code
of Civil Procedure qualifies the liability imposed upon directors
by section 451 of the Civil Code, and creates a condition to the
corresponding right of action against them, which goes with
it.into any jurisdiction where the action may be brought.
But the question certified raises greater difficulties both as to
construction and as to power. We have first to consider
whether section 554 purports to qualify, or to impose a condition upon, liabilities already incurred under the earlier act
taken up into section 451. In doing so we assume that the

word "directors" in the later act means the same as "trustees"
in the earlier one. The contrary was not suggested.
At the argument we were pressed with section 3455 of the
Code of Civil Procedure: "No action or proceeding commenced
before this Code takes effect, and no right accrued, is affected
by its provisions." But the trouble made by this is more
seeming than real. The following section deals specifically
with limitations, and must be taken to override a merely gen-eral precaution against the disturbance of vested rights. By
ยง 3456: "When a limitation or period of time prescribed in any
existing statute for acquiring a right or barring a remedy, or
for any other purpose, has begun to run before this Code goes
into effect, and the same or any limitation is prescribed in this
Code, the time which has already run shall be deemed part of
the time prescribed as such limitation by this Code." The
language clearly imports that the limitations in the Code are
to apply to existing obligations upon which the previous limitation already had begun to run. The result is that ยง 554 pur.ports to substitute a three years' limitation for the one year
previously in force, assuming that the previous one year limitation applied to this case, as under the decisions it aid.
tate
Savings Bank v. Johnson, 18 Montana, 440; Park Bank v.
Rernsen, 158 U. S. 337, 342. But if ยง 554 purported to make
this substitution, it purported to introduce important changes.
It lengthened the time on the one hand, but it took away the
exception in case of absence from the State on the other. This
last is disputed, but it seems to us a part of the meaning of the
words "This title does not affect actions against directors,"
etc. The section as to absence from the State is a part of the
title, and whatever necessary exceptions may be made from
the generality of the words quoted, this is not one of them.
. A turther difference is that, while there might be difficulties
in construing the general limitation upon actions for penalties
as going to the right, this section is so specific that it hardly
can mean anything else. We express no opinion as to the
earlier act, but we think that this ยง 554 so definitely deals

with the liability sought to be enforced that upon the principles heretofore established it must be taken to affect its sub.stance so far as it can, although passed at a different time from
the statute by which that liability first was created. We do
not go beyond the case before us. Different considerations
might apply to the ordinary statutes as to stockholders. We
express no opinion with regard to that.
We come then to the question of power. It is said that a
statute of limitations cannot take away an existing right but
only remedies, and therefore that, whatever the effect of ยง 554
on subsequently accruing liabilities, it cannot bar the plaintiff
in this suit. Before considering this it is to be observed ii the
first place that, so far as the State'of Montana was concerned,
the only practical difference made by the statute was to take
away the allowance for absence from the State while giving
over a year for the prosecution of the action within it. The
cause of action accrued on September 22, 1893, and the new
statute went into effect on July 1, 1895, so that the plaintiffs
had at least until September 22, 1896, in which to sue there.
As to action within the State, it could not be contended that
the change took away constitutional rights. It did not shorten
liability unreasonably. Wheeler v. Jackson, 137 U. S. 245.
The only way in which it could be made out that the attempt
to take away a remedy outside the State after the same lapse
of time was unconstitutional is through the theoretical proposition which we have stated. It is said that remedies outside
the State can be affected only by destroying the right, and
that no statute of limitations can do that.
It is quite incredible that such an unsubstantial distinction
should find a place in constitutional law. Prescription which
applies to easement the analogy of the statute of limitations
unquestionably vests a title. There is no such thing as a
merely possessory easement. A disseisor of a dominant estate
may get an easement which already is attached to it, but the
easement is attached to the land by title or not at all. Again,
as to land the distinction amounts to nothing, because to deny

DAVIS v. MILLS.
194 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

all remedy, direct or indirect, within the State is practically to
deny the right. "The lapse of time limited by such statutes
not only bars the remedy, but it extinguishes the right, and
vests a perfect title in the adverse holder." Leffingwell v.
Warren, 2 Black, 599, 605. So far as we have observed, the
cases which have had occasion to deal with the matter generally hold that the title to chattels, even, passes where the
statute has run. Campbell v. Holt, 115 U. S. 620, 623; Chapin

v. Freeland, 142 Massachusetts, 383, 386.

Property is pro-

tected because such protection answers a demand of human

nature, and therefore takes the place of a fight. But that
demand is not founded more certainly by creation or discovery
than it is by the lapse of time, which gradually shapes the mind
to expect and demand the continuance of what it actually and
long has enjoyed, even if without right, and dissociates it from
a like demand of even a right which long has been denied.
Dunbar v. Boston & Providence Railroad, 181 Massachusetts,
383, 385. Constitutions are intended to preserve practical
and substantial rights, not to maintain theories. It is pretty
safe to assume that when the law may deprive a man of all the
benefits of what once was his, it may deprive him 6f technical
title as well. That it may do so is shown sufficiently by the
cases which we have cited and many others.
In the case at bar the question comes up in the most attenuated form. The law is dealing not with tangible property,
but with a cause of action of its own creation. The essential
feature of that cause of action is that it is one in the jurisdiction which created it; that it is one elsewhere is a more or less
accidental incident. If the laws of!Montana can set the limitation to the domestic suit, it is the least possible stretch to
say that they may set it also to a foreign action, even if to that
extent an existing right is cut down. We can see no constitutional obstacle in the way, and we are of opinion that they have
purported to do it and have done it.
The question is answered in the affirmative, and it will be so
certifed.
