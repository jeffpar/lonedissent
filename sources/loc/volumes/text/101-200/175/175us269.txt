ARKANSAS BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
'v. MADDEN.
APPEAL FRO31 THE. CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 68. Submitted October 26, 1899. -Decided

December 4,1899.

The collection of taxes under the authority of a State will not be enjoined
by a court of the United State6 on the sole ground that the tax is illegal;
but it must appear that the party taxed has no adequate remedy by the
ordinary processes of the law, and that there are special circumstances
bringing the case within some recognized head of equity jurisdiction.
In Texas the law is established that when a person, by the compulsion of
the color of legal process, or of seizure of his person or goods, pays
money unlawfully demanded, he may ;recover it back.
Inasmuch as the bill in this case contains nothing to indicate inability on
the one hand to pay the franchise tax in question, or, on the other, to
respond in judgment if it were found to have been illegally exacted, and
sets up no special circumstances justifying the exercise of equity jurisdictloh other than consequences which complainant can easily avert without
loss or injury, the court holds that the bill cannot be sustained.

By an act of the State of Texas approved April 3, 1889,
(Laws Tex. 1889, c. 78, p. 87,) foreign corporations for pecuniary profit, with some exceptions not material here, desiring
to do business in the State of Texas were required to file with
the secretary of state a duly certified copy of their articles
of incorporation and obtain a permit to transact business in
the State, paying a fee therefor, the permit not to be issued
for a period longer than ten years from the date of the filing.
By an act approved May 11, 1893, (Laws 1893, c. 102,. ยง 5,,
p. 158,) it was provided "that each and every private domestic corporation heretofore chartered or that may be hereafter chartered under the laws of this State, and each and every
foreign corporation that has received or may hereafter receive
a permit to do business under the laws of this State, in this
State, shall pay to the secretary of state, annually, on or
before the first day of May, a franchise tax of ten dollars.
Any such corporation which shall fail to pay the tax pro-

vided for in this section shall, because of such failure, forfeit
their charter."
. Section 17 of Article I of the constitution of Texas, ratified
February 17, 1876, provided: "No persbn's property shall be

without adequate compensation being made unless by the
consent of such 'person; and, when taken, except foi the
use of the State, such compensation shall be first :made, or
seaured, by h deposit of money; and no irrevocable or uncontrollable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be
made; but all privileges and franchises granted by the legislature or created under its authority shall be subject to the
control thereof."

In July, 1896, the Arkansas Building and Loan Association,

ARKATSAS BUILDING ASSOCIATION v. MADDEN. 271
Statement of the Case.

a corporation of the State of Arkansas, filed its charter with
the secretary of the State of Texas, and paid the fee required
by the act of 1889, as well as the franchise tax of ten dollars
required to be paid' by the act of 1893, and received a permit
to carry on its business in Texas for ten years.
The provisions of the acts of 1889 and 1893 were carried
into the Revised*Statutesof the State of Texas of 1895. By
an act approved April 30, 1897, (Laws Tex. 1897, c. 104, p.
140,) and an act approved May 15, 1897, (Laws Tex, 1897, c.
120, p. 168,) these provisions were amended so as arhong other
things to increase the annual franchise tax theretofore required, to graduate it according to the. capital stock of the
corporation, to provide that the failure to pay it should work
a forfeiture of the right to do business in the State, and that
the secretary of state should declare ,such forfeiture. The
taxes imposed by these amendments were less upon domestic
corporations than upon foreign corporations. Thereafter the
Arkansas Building, and Loan Association offered to pay the
secretary of state the ten dollars required .by the prior law
as the franchise tax for the ensuing year, but the secretary
refused to accept that sum and to give to the company the
franchise tax receipt therefor, and demanded the larger sum
required by the law of 1897, which amounted to two hundred
and five dollars.
The company then filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Western District of Texas against the'
secretary of state of Texas, setting up the foregoing facts,
and charging that the act of 1897 was void because in contravention of the constitution Qf Texas, and of the commerce
clause of the Constitution of the United States and of the
Fourteenth Amendment to that instrument, and praying an
injunctio4 against the secretary of state restraining him from
the collection of said alleged illegal tax, and from declaring
complainant's permit and right to do business in the State
forfeited by failure to pay the tax, and for general relief.
To this bill defendant demurred, assigning as grounds that
it set up no cause of action; that it dfscl-sed that complainant had an adequate remedy at law ; and that it showed that

the demand made of complainant was "in compliance with
a valid existing law of. the State of Texas." The Circuit
Court held that the law was valid and dismissed the bill.

M .CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The rule is that the collection of taxes under state authority
.will not be enjoined by a court of the United States on the
sole ground that the tax is illegal, but it must appear that the
party taxed has no adequate remedy by the ordinary processes of the law, and that there are special circumstances
-bringing the case within some recognized head of* equity
jurisdiction. Pittsburg &c. Railway v. Board of Public
Works, 172 U. S.32; Shelton v. Platt,139 U. S.591; Dows
v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 112.
In Dows v. Chicago, which has been frequently cited with
approval, it was said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the
court:

"The party of whom an illegal tax is collected has ordinarily ample remedy, either by action against the officer making the collection or the body to whom the tax is paid. Here
such remedy existed. If the tax was illegal, the plaintiff
protesting against its enforcement might have had his action,
after it was paid, against the officer or the city to recover
back the money, or he might have prosecuted either for his
damages. No irreparable injury would have followed to him
from its collection. Nor would he have been compelled to
resort to a multiplicity of suits to determine his rights."
These decisions are in harmony with the sixteenth section
of the judiciary act of 1789, now section 723 of the Revised
Statutes, which declared the rule as then, and still existing,

. Opinion of the Court.

that "suits in equity shall not be sustained in either of the
courts of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate and complete remedy may be had at law."
And on principle, the interference of the courts of the
United States by injunction with the collection of state taxes,
or with state administration of matters of internal police, can
only be justified in a plain case not otherwise remediable.
The grievance complained of in this case is that the Arkansas corporation entered on the transaction of business in Texas
at a time when the annual franchise or license tax was ten
dollars, and that it is now required to pay two hundred and
five dollars/by a subsequent law, which, it alleges, is unconstitutional.
The penalty denounced on failure to pay is the forfeiture of
the right to do business in the State, and complainant averred
that if that forfeiture were declared it would be subjected to
irreparable injury and a multiplicity of suits.
It is on these grounds of equity interposition that the aid of
the Circuit Court was sought to restrain the discharge by a
state officer of duties imposed on him by the law of the State
and to adjudicate as to the validity of that law.
But the bill of complaint did not set forth any facts tending
to show that complainant could not escape the forfeiture by
payment of the two hundred and .five dollars under protest,
and recover back the money so paid if the law should be held
void.
We assume that the payment would, under the circumstances detailed, be compulsory and not voluntary, and no
reason is perceived why the rule permitting recovery back
would not apply.
That rule as applicable here is that an action will lie for
money paid, under compulsion, or an illegal demand, the pgrson making it being notified that his right to do so is contested. Elliot v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137; Bend vi loyt, 13
Pet. 263; Philadelphia v. Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 731; Swift
COampany v. United States, 111 U. S. 22. The principle is
thus stated by Gaines, J., in Taylor v. Hall, 71 Texas, 213:
"The law is established that when a person, by the compulVOL. cLxv-18

sion of the color of legal process, or of seizure of his person
-'or goods, pays money unlawfully demanded, he may recover
it bick?'
The fact that the defendant is a state official is not in itself
a defence, and our attention has been called to no statute of
Texas which substitutes any other for the common law rule.
Inasmuch as the bill contains nothing to indicate inability
on the one hand to pay the franchise tax in question, or on
the other, to respond in judgment if it were found to have
been illegally exacted, and sets up no special circumstances
justifying the exercise of equity jurisdiction other than consequences which complainant can easily avert, without loss or
injury, we are of opinion that it cannot be sustained.
It is quite possible that in cases of this sort the validity of
a law may be more conveniently tested, by the party denying
it, by a bill in equity than by an action at law; but considerations of that character, while they may explain, do not
justify, resort to that mode of proceeding.

Decree modifted to a dismissal without prejudice,and as so
modified affirmed.

SEEBERGER v. McCORMICK.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

No. 822. Submitted October 16, 1899. -Decided December 4, 1899.
The contention, even if formally made, that plaintiffs in error were seeking to avail themselves of some right or immunity under the Constitution
or laws of the United States, does not give this court jurisdiction to
review the judgment of the Supreme Court of a State, where that judgment was based upon a doctrine of general law, sufficient of itself to
determine the case.
It having been decided in McCormick v. Market Bank, 165 U. S. 538, that
the contract of lease there in suit was void, the plaintiff in error in that
case commenced this action in a state court in Illinois to recover from
citizens of that State the rent for the property .which had been intended
to be leased to the bank by the void lease, on the ground that they had
