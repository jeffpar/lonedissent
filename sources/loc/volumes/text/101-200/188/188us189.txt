BLACKSTONE v. MILLER.
ERROR TO THE

SURROGATEIS

COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY, STATE

OF NEW YORK.
No. 423. Argued January 5, 6, 1903.-Decided January 26, 1903.

Where a deposit made by a citizen of Illinois in a Trust Company in the
City of New York remains there fourteen months, the property is delayed within the jurisdiction of New York long enough to justify the
finding of the state court that it was not in transitn in such a sense as
to withdraw it from the power of the State if it were otherwise taxable,
even though the depositor intended to withdraw the funds for investment.
Under the laws of New York such deposit is subject to the transfer tax,
notwithstanding that the whole succession had been taxed in Illinois,
including this deposit.
The fact that two States, dealing each with its own law of succession, both
of which have to be invoked by the person claiming rights, have taxed
the right which they respectively confer, gives no ground for complaint
on constitutional grounds.
Power over the person of the debtor confers jurisdiction, and a State has
an equal right to impose a succession tax on debts owed by its citizens
as upon tangible assets found within the State at the time of the death.
Where a state law imposing a tax upon transfer is in force before the funds
come within the State the tax does not impair the obligation of any contract, deny full faith or credit to a judgment taxing the inheritance in
another State, or deprive the executrix and legatees of the decedent of
any privilege or immunity as citizens of the taxing State, nor is it contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.
THE

case is stated in the opinion of the court.

I. The debts in question have no tangible situs within the State
of New York. They were intangible, unidentifiable and incapable of physical situs, and were not subject to levy or sale, or to
be replevied; it was not necessary to take out letters of administration in New York to collect them. Toronto General Trust

2. These principles have been embodied in the New York
statutory scheme. New York Tax Law, ch. 908 of the Laws of
1896, art. I, §§ 1-14, entitled "Taxable Property and Place of
Taxation" is applicable to the entire law. .'fatter of L1untington, 168 N. Y. 399. The phrase, " property within the State,"
used in § 220 is as old as New York's taxing system and has been
frequently construed to exclude intangible property of non-residents. People ex rel. Iemmon v. Feitner,167 N. Y. 1 ; Mlfatter
of Hellman,Appellate Division, First Department, 1902; 3latter

same exemptions as a resident and the taxation of non-residents
is purely in rem. People v. Barker, 154 _N.Y. 128 ; City of

3. These principles apply with equal force to transfer or succession taxes ; jurisdiction of the person of the decedent or of
his property must exist. Kintzing v. Hutchinson, 14 Fed. Cas.

and could not be converted into money on demand. Substitutes
for money are not to be deemed money for taxation unless they
are exact equivalents. Hubbard v. IM I. & H . 1?., 14

II. If the indebtedness of the Trust Company was property
within the State of New York, it was not taxable because it
was only transitorily there, and in the case of property of nonresidents in transitu the requisite jurisdiction to tax does not
exist. Hlays v. Pacifc -Mail S. S. Co., 17 How. 596; Peop)le,

IV. As succession, inheritance and transfer taxes in the United States are levied upon the power to transmit the title to
property, and not upon the property itself, the State of New
York was without jurisdiction in this case to tax the exercise
of a power which it (lid not create and could not take away.
1. That the thing taxed is the rigit to transmit has been settled by this court as to the Federal legacy tax. Knowlton v.
Afoore, 178 U. S. 41; Eidman v. Jfartinrez, 184 U. S. 578, 589;
Afoore v. Ruckgaber, 184 U. 593. As to the New York transfer

Illinois inheritance tax, Mayoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings
Bank, 170 U. S.283.
2. The New York transfer tax has been repeatedly interpreted in that way by the Court of Appeals. Matter of Swift,
137 N. Y. 77, 88 ; iMatter of Mferriam, 141 N. Y. 479, 484;

As/ton, 94 Tennessee, 674; In re Wilmerding, 117 California,
281 ; Gilsthorpe v. Furnell,20 Nontana, 299.
As thus limited a tax upon the power of transmission can
only be imposed by the sovereignty creating the power, and the
transmission in this case was effected solely by the law of Illinois. Eidman v. 3fartinez, 184 U. S. 592; Ifintzing v. Hutchinson, 14 Fed. Cas. 649. There are seven examples of different
governmental impositions under the head of "death duties"

V. Where any doubt exists as to liability to a succession tax,
the doubt should be resolved in favor of the person sought to
be taxed. The Court of Appeals erred in adopting the broader
construction of the law. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S.

Wall. 423, 430; Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 183, 190. The
proceedings were irregular as the Surrogate adjudged that the
property was exempt and the Comptroller of the city of New
York was not a person aggrieved by the order within the meaning of the section of the Code of Civil Procedure (§ 2258), permitting an appeal, and the Court of Appeals erred in allowing
the proceedings to stand until the Comptroller of the State
could be substituted. The failure to deduct from the value of
the property the amount of the Illinois inheritance tax and the
Federal legacy tax was error.
The sovereign power of the States to tax successions should
not be impaired but the power should be exercised fairly and
harmoniously under the guidance of Constitutional restraints,
and in accord with established principles of law.

I. Whether the" deposits" made by the decedent with the Trust
Company and Cuyler, Iorgan & Co. be regarded as "money"

his death, or as a "debt" owing to him at that time by these

"depositaries," the court of last resort of that State has declared it to be the intention of the legislature of that sovereignty to tax the succession to such money or credit although
the decedent was at the time of his death a resident of Illinois.
1, 2. The decisions of New York have construed these statutes as imposing a tax upon the right of succession to the property of a decedent, and not upon a decedent's estate as such,
and, in effect, to limit the power of testamentary disposition,
and that legatees and devisees take their bequests and devises
subject to this tax imposed upon the succession to property.
In other words, it is a tax upon the right to take property by
devise or descent. 2fatter of Xlerriam, 141 N. Y. 479, 480;

The constitutionality of a tax on the succession to property
has been uniformly recognized and is no longer open to question, since the elaborate consideration which the subject received in the opinion of Mr. Justice McKenna in JlAagoun v.
Illinois Trust & Savings Bak, 170 U. S. 283, 287, 288.
The courts of New York have had occasion to frequently
apply this statute to the succession to personal property of nonresidents which at the time of the death of the decedent was
within the State. -Jfatterof Romaine, 127 I. Y. 80; 13ater

The highest court of New York has thus interpreted the
statute now under consideration as providing that where a nonresident dies leaving a deposit in a bank or trust company within
the State of New York, a transfer by will or intestate law of

such deposit is a transfer of money-" of property within the
State," and as such is governed by the provision of section 220
of the tax law.

Banana Co. v. Board of Assessors, 49 La. Ann. 43; Parker,
Tax Collector, v. Strauss & Co., 49 La. Ann. 1173.
The deposit of money in such institutions exacts from the
State the provision of continual safe-guards, civil, police and
military, for the benefit of the depositor.
For the protection of those leaving their money with banks
and trust companies, the State of New York has devised an
elaborate system of investigation, supervision and administration of institutions of this class.
Taxation is the correlative of protection, and is as applicable
to a non-resident owner of property as to a resident owner.
The deposit with the United States Trust Company did not,
however, partake of the nature of a general deposit, but was a
special deposit in trust. Jenkins v. Nteff, 163 N. Y. 320, 330,

But treating the deposit of the proceeds of these shares of
stock as an ordinary deposit, it is nevertheless bhlieved that it
was property of the decedent within the State of New York.

Before this fund could be distributed at the place of the decedent's domicil, such distribution could only be made through
the aid of the New York courts by means of administration
there, of the debt owing to the decedent; and title was, therefore, derivable through such administration.

an executor or administrator appointed in one State cannot as

Froting/]/amv. Sh4aw, 175 -Massachusetts, 59, 61.
Such duties are levied in respect of the control which every
government has over property within its jurisdiction, irrespective of the domicil of the decedent. Laidley v. Lord Advocate,
15 App. Cases, 468, 483 ; Hanson on Death Duties, 2, 63.
II. If the funds in question are to be regarded as money of
the decedent within the State, in accordance with the decision
in the IHoudayer case, then no question as to the validity of
the tax can arise, since it must be conceded that it was within
the power of the New York legislature to place a succession
tax upon the tangible property within the State of a non-resident decedent. Callahan v. TFoodbridge, 171 Massachusetts,
595; 1t re Romaine, 127 N. Y. 80; Matter of Wlhiting, 150
N. Y. 27; Albany v. Powell, 2 Jones' Eq. 51, and cases cited
under point III.
III. As the legislature of New York intended to bring
within its taxing power deposits made with residents of New
York by non-residents for the purposes of assessing a succession
tax upon the estate of the latter, as declared in the Iloudayer
case, it is within the power of such legislature to create a situs
for such property within the sovereignty of New York for purposes of taxation.
It is doubtless true that under the legal fiction embodied in
the maxim mobilia _personam sequuntur personal estate is
deemed to have no situs separate from the person or residence
of the owner, and it is on the basis of this maxim that it is
claimed that debts and choses in action can have no situs other
than that of the creditor.
This fiction is not, however, superior to the legislative power
and has been so frequently disregarded in legislation that it
has become practically exploded. This is illustrated by the attachment laws, to which reference has already been made, and
is demonstrated by a long line of decisions in various jurisdictions affecting the subject of taxation, citing New York decisions as follows : People ex iel. Hifoyt v. commissioners of Taxes,

From these decisions the rule is deducible that it is within
the power of the State to which resort must be had for the purpose of reducing to possession property of a decedent, whether
a resident or a non-resident, by those succeeding to his ownership, to impose such restrictions and conditions on the rights of
succession as it may see fit to create, whether the property to
be reduced to possession is tangible or intangible, real or personal, and even though it may be a mere credit. UnitedStates

The war tax on inheritances was sustained in nowlton v.

exclusive province of state and not Federal regulation.
VI. The decision sought to be reviewed does not deny full
faith and credit to any public acts, records or judicial proceedings in the State of Illinois. Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104

VII. The statute does not deprive the plaintiff in error of
any of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the State of
New York.
The act under consideration seeks to tax the right of succession to all property within the State, whether it belongs to a
resident or a non-resident. It certainly creates no exception in
favor of a resident of the State. It gives him no privilege or
immunity. Non-residents are only taxed on the right of succession to property within the State, while residents of the State
are subjected to a tax upon all of their property wherever it
may be situated. J'Tager v. Grima, 8 How. 490; Wallace v.

the privileges and immunities of the plaintiff in error. It does
not deny to her the equal protection of the law. 3fagoun v.

MR. JUSTWxE RuOL-ts

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to the Surrogate's Court of the county
of New York. It is brought to review a decree of the court, sustained by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, 69 App.
Div. 127, and by the Court of Appeals, 171 N. Y. 682, levying a
tax on the transfer by will of certain property of Timothy B.
Blackstone, the testator, who died domiciled in Illinois. The
property consisted of a debt of $10,692.24, due to the deceased
by a firm, and of the net sum of 84,843,456.72, held on a deposit
account by the United States Trust Company of New York.
The objection was taken seasonably upon the record that the
transfer of this property could not be taxed in New York consistently with the Constitution of the United States.
The deposit in question represented the proceeds of railroad
stock sold to a syndicate and handed to the Trust Company,
which, by arrangement with the testator, held the proceeds
subject to his order, paying interest in the meantime. Five
days' notice of withdrawal was required, and if a draft was
made upon the company, it gave its check upon one of its banks

Opinion of the Court.

of deposit. The fund had been held in this way from March 31,
1899, until the testator's death on May 26, 1900. Itis probable,
of course, that he did not intend to leave the fund there forever
and that he was looking out for investments, but he had not
found them when he died. The tax is levied under a statute

law, of property within the State, and the decedent was a nonresident of the State at the time of his death." Laws of 1896,
c. 908, § 220, amended, Laws of 1897, c. 284; 3 Birdseye's Stat.
3d ed. 1901, p. 3592. The whole succession has been taxed
in Illinois, the New York deposit being included in the appraisal of the estate. It is objected to the New York tax that
the property was not within the State, and that the courts of
New York had no jurisdiction; that if the property was within
the State it was only transitorily there, Tays v. Pacific JL[ail
Steamshilp Co., 17 How. 596, 599, 600, that the tax impairs the
obligation of contracts, that it denies full faith and credit to
the judgment taxing the inheritance in Illinois, that it deprives
the executrix and legatees of privileges and immunities of citizens of the State of New York, and that it is contrary to the
Fourteenth Amendment.
In view of the state decisions it must be assumed that the
New York statute is intended to reach the transfer of this property if it can be reached. New Orleans v. Stemp)el, 175 U. S.
309, 316 ; Morley v. Lake S/iore & JXichigan Southern, Ry. Co.,
146 U. S. 162, 166. We also must take it to have been found
that the property was not in transitu in such a sense as to withdraw it from the power of the State, if otherwise the right to
tax the transfer belonged to the State. The property was delayed within the jurisdiction of New York an indefinite time,
which had lasted for more than a year, so that this finding at
least was justified. • Kelley v. k/hoads, ante, p. 1, and Diamond
.Match Co. v. Village of Ontonagon, ante, p. 84, present term.
Both parties agree with the plain words of the law that the tax
is a tax upon the transfer, not upon the deposit, and we need
spend no time upon that. Therefore the naked question is
whether the State has a right to tax the transfer by will of
such deposit.

OOTOBtR TIPRi£f, 1902.
Opinion of the Court.

The answer is somewhat obscured by the superficial fact that
New York, like most other States, recognizes the law of the
domicil as the law determining the right of universal succession.
The domici], naturally, must control a succession of that kind.
Universal succession is the artificial continuance of the person
of a deceased by an executor, heir, or the like, so far as succession to rights and obligations is concerned. It is a fiction, the
historical origin of which is familiar to scholars, and it is this
fiction that gives whatever meaning it has to the saying nobilia
seqaunturyersonarn. But being a fiction it is not allowed to
obscure the facts, when the facts become important. To a considerable, although more or less varying, extent the succession
determined by the law of the domicil is recognized in other
jurisdictions. But it hardly needs illustration to show that the
recognition is limited by the policy of the local law. Ancillary
administrators pay the local debts before turning over the residue to be distributed, or distributing it themselves, according
to the rules of the domicil. The title of the principal administrator, or of a foreign assignee in bankruptcy, another type of
universal succession, is admitted in but a limited way or not at
all. See Crapo v. Kelly, 16 Wall. 610; Cltipmana v. Jlatnqftcturers' vational Bank, 156 Massachusetts, 147, 148, 149.
To come closer to the point, no one doubts that succession to
a tangible chattel may be taxed wherever the property is found,
and none the less that the law of the situs accepts its rules of
succession from the law of the domicil, or that by the law of
the domicil the chattel is part of a itniversitasand is taken into
account again in the succession tax there. Eidman v. 3lartinez,
184 U. S. 578, 586, 587, 592. See Alager v. Geihma, 8 How.
490, 493; Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 5241; Pullman's Palace

ferent and more or less inconsistent principles, leads to some
hardship. It may be regretted, also, that one and the same State
should be seen taxing on the one hand according to the fact of
power, and on the other, at the same time, according to the fiction that, in successions after death, mobilia seqwunt ye'rsona
and domicil governs the whole. But these inconsistencies infringe no rule of constitutional law. Coe v. E&rol, 116 U. S.
517, 524; Knowlton v. Xoore, 178 U. S. 41.
The question then is narrowed to whether a distinction is to
be taken between tangible chattels and the deposit in this case.
There is no doubt that courts in New York and elsewhere have
been loath to recognize a distinction for taxing purposes between
what commonly is called money in the bank and actual coinin the
pocket. The practical similarity more or less has obliterated
the legal difference. Matter of floudayer, 150 N. Y. 37; lYew
Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309, 316; City National Bank v.
Charles Baker Co., 180 Massach usetts, 40, 42. In view of these
cases, and the decision in the present case, which followed them,
a not very successful attempt was made to show that by reason
of the facts which we have mentioned, and others, the deposit
here was unlike an ordinary deposit in a bank. We shall not stop
to discuss this aspect of the case, because we prefer to decide it
upon a broader view.
If the transfer of the deposit necessarily depends upon and
involves the law of New York for its exercise, or, in other words,
if the transfer is subject to the power of the State of New York,
then New York may subject the transfer to a tax. United
States v. Peerkins, 163 U. S. 625, 628, 629; XcCulloch v. .ifaryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429. But it is plain that the transfer does
depend upon the law of New York, not because of any theoretical speculation concerning the whereabouts of the debt, but because of the practical fact of its power over the person of the
debtor. The principle has been recognized by this court with
regard to garnishments of a domestic debtor of an absent defendant. ihicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Sturm, 174
U. S. 710. See IWyman v. Halstead, 109 U. S. 654. What gives
the debt validity? Nothing but the fact that the law of the
place where the debtor is will make him pay. It does not

matter that the law would not need to be invoked in the particular case. Most of us do not commit crimes, yet we nevertheless are subject to the criminal law, and it affords one of the
motives for our conduct. So again, what enables any other
than the very creditor in proper person to collect the debt ?
The law of the same place. To test it, suppose that New York
should turn back the current of legislation and extend to debts
the rule still applied to slander that actiopersonalismroritiurcun
persona,and should provide that all debts hereafter contracted
in New York and payable there should be extinguished by the
death of either party. Leaving constitutional considerations on
one side, it is plain that the right of the foreign creditor would
be gone.
Power over the person of the debtor confers jurisdiction, we
repeat. And this being so we perceive no better reason for
denying the right of New York to impose a succession tax on
debts owed by its citizens than upon tangible chattels found
within the State at the time of the death. The maxim mobilia
sequuntu Jversonam has no more truth in the one case than in
the other. When logic and the policy of a State conflict with
a fiction due to historical tradition, the fiction must give way.
There is no conflict between our views and the point decided
in the case reported under the name of State Tax on Foreign
lVeld Bonds, 15 Wall. 300. The taxation in that case was on the
interest on bonds held out of the State. Bonds and negotiable
instruments are more than merely evidences of debt. The debt
is inseparable from the paper which declares and constitutes it,
by a tradition which comes down from more archaic conditions.
.Baconv. Rooker, 177 -Massachusetts, 335, 337. Therefore, considering only the place of the property, it was held that bonds
held out of the State could not be reached. The decision has
been cut down to its precise point by later cases. Savings &
Loan Society v. XJfdtnomah County, 169 U. S. 421, 428; .New
Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309, 319, 320.
In the case at bar the law imposing the tax was in force before the deposit was made, and did not impair the obligation of
the contract, if a tax otherwise lawful ever can be said to have
that effect. Pinney v. M.elso?, 183 U. S. 144, 147. The fact

BLACKSTONE r. MILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

that two States, dealing each with its own law of succession,
both of which the plaintiff in error has to invoke for her rights,
have taxed the right which they respectively confer, gives no
cause for complaint on constitutional grounds. Coe v. Errol,
116 U. S. 517, 524; Knowlton v. -Moore, 178 U. S. 53. The
universal succession is taxed in one State, the singular succession is taxed in another. The plaintiff has to make out her
right under both in order to get the money. See Adcams v.
Batchelder, 173 Massachusetts, 258. The same considerations
answer the argument that due faith and credit are not given to
the judgment in Illinois. The tax does not deprive the plaintiff in error of any of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of New York. It is no such deprivation that if she had
lived in New York the tax on the transfer of the deposit would
have been part of the tax on the inheritance as a whole. See
Mlager v. Grima, S H-ow. 490; Brown v. Iouston, 114 U. S.
622, 635; lFallace v. 2Jfyers, 38 Fed. Rep. 184. It does not
violate the' Fourteenth Amendment. See .JAagoun v. Illinois
Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283. Matters of state procedure and the correctness of the New York decree or judgment, apart from specific constitutional objections, are not open
here. As we have said, the question whether the property was
to be regarded as in transitu, if material, must be regarded as
found against the plaintiff in error.
