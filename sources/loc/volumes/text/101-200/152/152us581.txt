SEEBERGER v. SCHLESINGER.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 274. Argued and submitted March 13, 1894. -Decided April 9,189.
Chinese goat skins, tanned with the hair on, so that the skin Is soft and
pliant, should not be classified for the assessment of customs duties as
"rugs," under the act of March 3, 1883, c. 121, 22 Stat. 488.
The commercial designation of an imported article is not a matter of which
courts can take judicial notice, but is a fact to be proved by evidence.
When the court below makes special findings, no exception is necessary to
raise the question whether the facts support the judgment.
Shell-covered opera glasses, composed of shell, metal, and glass, Imported
under the tariff act of March 3, 1883, c. 121, were subject to be classed
as manufactures composed in part of metal, under &ehedule C, and were
dutiable at 45 per cent.

Tis was an action by the firm of Schlesinger & Mayer
against the collector of the port of Chicago to recover duties
paid upon certain importations of Chinese goat skins and pearl
opera glasses, entered for consumption at the custom-house at
Chicago.
The case was tried by the court, without a jury. The court
made a special finding of facts, and awarded the plaintiff
judgment for $113.60 for excess duties upon the goat skins,
and $6.60 upon the opera glasses.
Defendant sued out a writ of error from this court.

. JUSTiE BRowN delivered the opinion of the court.

This case involves the proper classification for duties under
the act of March 3,1883, c. 121, 22 Stat. 488, of Chinese goat
skins and pearl opera glasses.
1. In reference to the goat skins, the court found that the
plaintiffs imported and entered at the custom-house in the port
and district of Chicago certain Chinese goat skins, dressed
and finished, upon which the plaintiffs paid a duty of 40 per
cent ad valorem, as "rugs" not otherwise provided for, classified and assessed by the defendant collector, under Schedule
K, act of March 3, 1883, namely: "Carpets and carpetings of
wool, flax, or cotton . . . not otherwise herein specified, forty
per centum ad valorem; and mats, rugs . . . shall be subjected to the rate of duty herein imposed on carpets." Plaintiffs
paid these duties under protest, and appealed to the Secretary
of the Treasury, claiming that such merchandise should be assessed at a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem under Schedule N,
"Sundries," as "skins dressed and finished, of all kinds, not specially enumerated." The court further found "that the goods in
question were described in the invoice as ' Chinese goat skins;'
that they are tanned with the hair on so that the skin is soft
and pliant; that none of the skins are whole or entire, but
that the articles imported are made of pieces of skins tanned
as aforesaid, loosely sewed together so as to make large
parallelogram-shaped pieces about 18 inches wide by 36 to 49
inches long; that they are advertised and sold to some extent
for floor rugs, and are sometimes lined and trimmed for sleigh
and carriage robes; that they are not always used in the
shape imported, but are sometimes cut apart at the seams, or
cut into strips and dyed, and used for trimming lap robes,
overcoats," etc.

SEEBERGER v. SCHLESINGER.
Opinion of the Court.

We agree with the court below in holding that the skins in
question were improperly classified as "rugs." Schedule K of
the act of March 3, 1883, (22 Stat. page 508,) is entitled "Wool
and Woollens," and, until the clause in question is reached,
provides for duties upon various classes of wools, woollen goods,
clothing, carpets, including, as an analogous material, the hair
of the alpaca, goat, and other like animals, with fabrics made
of such hair, or mixtures of the same with wool. The schedule
then imposes a duty of six cents per yard upon "hemp or jute
carpeting," and then provides that "carpets and carpetings of
wool, flax, or cotton, or parts of either or other material, not
otherwise herein specified, forty p~r centum ad valorem; and
mats, rugs, screens, covers, hassocks, bedsides, and other portions of carpets or carpetings, shall be subjected to the rate of
duty herein iinposed on carpets or carpetings of like character
or description ; and the duty on all other mats not exclusively
of vegetable material, screens, hassocks, and rugs, shall be
forty per centum ad valorem." There is no mention here of
skins, or of hair attached to the skin ; and while, if the articles
in question were used exclusively or principally as rugs, they
might be included within that designation, the fact that they
were of the size of small rugs, and were advertised and sold to
some extent for that purpose, would not be sufficient, if a more
specific designation could be found. It not only appears that
they were sometimes lined and trimmed for sleigh and carriage
robes, but that they were not always used in the shapes imported, and were sometimes cut apart at the seams, and cut
into strips and dyed and used for trimming garments. In
fact, their uses were so various that they afford a very unsatisfactory criterion for their classification.
The plaintiffs took the ground in their protest, and in this
they were sustained by the court below, that they should be
classified under Schedule N, " Sundries.- Skins dressed and
finished." The clause relied upon is one providing for the
assessment of leathers, and reads as follows (page 513):
"Leather, bend or belting leather, and Spanish or other sole
leather, and leather not specially enumerated or provided for
in this act, fifteen per centum ad valorem.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

"Calfskins, tanned, or tanned and dressed, and dressed
upper leather of all other kinds, and skin3 dressed and finished,
of all kinds, not specially enumerated or provided for in this
act, and skins of morocco, finished, twenty per centum ad
valorem.
"Skins for morocco, tanned, but unfinished, ten per centum
ad valorem.
"All manufactures and articles of leather, or of which
leather shall be a component part, not specially enumerated or
provided for in this act, thirty per centum ad valorem."
It is insisted, however, that the item of "skins dressed and
finished," read in connection with the residue of the clause,
and particularly with "skins for morocco, tanned, but unfinished," indicates that, by "skins dressed and finished" were
meant skins dressed and finished in the similitude of leather;
that is, by having the hair removed; and that a reference to
the corresponding clause of the Revised Statutes, section
2504, page 477, shows still more clearly that the clause in
question was not intended to include skins with the hair on: •
"Leather. - Bend or belting-leather, and Spanish or other
sole leather : fifteen per centum ad valorem; calfskins, tanned,
or tanned and dressed: twenty-five per centum ad valorem;
upper leather of all other kinds, and skins dressed and finished
of all kinds, not otherwise provided for: twenty per centumn
ad valorem; skins for morocco, tanned, but unfinished: ten
per centum ad valorem; manufactures and articles of leather,
or of which leather shall be a component part, not otherwise
provided for, thirty-five per centum ad valorem.
"Leather and skins japanned, patent, or enameled: thirtyfive per centum ad valorem.
"All leather and skins, tanned, not otherwise provided for:
twenty-five per centun ad valorem."
In this court, it is further claimed by the collector that
while none of the clauses referred to include skins of animals
with the hair on eo zomine, the goat skins in question fall either
directly or under the similitude clause within the description of
"dressed furs on the skin," page 513, and were dutiable at
twenty per centum ad valorem; that although goat skins are

not ordinarily classified as furs-a term usually reserved for
the short, fine hair of certain animals, whose skins are largely
used for clothing; yet in a commercial sense furs have been
regarded as including other skins, perhaps more properly designated by the term "peltry ;" and that within their commercial
designation is included the covering of all animals whose skin
is used either for warmth or ornament, with the hair on. In
this connection we are cited to the case of Astor v. Union
Insumance Co., 7 Cowen, 202, in which an "Invoice of furs"
was described as consisting of bear and raccoon skins, opossum,
deer, fine fisher, cross fox, marten, white raccoon, wild cat,
wolf, wolverine, panther, and cub skins. In this case evidence
was held to be properly admitted showing that, by the usage
of the trade, skins valuable chiefly on account of the fur were
called fur, while skins was a term appropriated to those
which were valuable chiefly for the skin, by which we understand the skin with the hair removed. Our attention is also
called to the Encyclopsedia Britannica, which, in treating of
the subject of fur, includes within that designation the skins
of the bear, buffalo, lamb, lion, tiger, and wolf, although perhaps none of these would fall within the popular definition of
furs.
The commercial designation of an article, however, is not a
matter of which courts can take judicial notice, but is a fact
to be proved like any other- by evidence. In this case there
is no finding as to the commercial meaning of the word
"furs," and no testimony whatever upon the subject, for
clearly neither the opinion in the Astor case nor the extract
from the encyclopedia can be considered as legitimate testimony. In short, the case was tried wholly upon the theory
that the goat skins in controversy were either "rugs" or
"skins dressed and finished." The collector, therefore, is in
no position, as the case is now presented, to ask for a reversal
upon -this ground; but as the case must be reversed upon
another ground, both parties will be at liberty upon a new trial
to introduce testimony upon the question of commercial usage.
2. With reference to the opera glasses, the court found
that the plaintiffs had imported certain shell-covered opera

Opinion of the Court.

glasses, composed of shell, metal, and glass, upon which said:
merchandise the plaintiffs paid a duty of 45 per cent ad
valorem, assessed by the defendant collector as "manufactured
articles, composed in part of -metal," under Schedule 0, act of
March 3, 1883; that plaintiffs protested and appealed to the
Secretary of the Treasury, claiming that these opera glasses
should be assessed a duty of 25 per cent ad valorem under
Schedule N, "Sundries," as "shells, whole or parts of, manufactured, of every description," and under section 2499, as.
"articles composed of shell, metal, and glass in which theshell is the component of chief value."
The court further found from the proofs that the "said
opera glasses are composed of silver or nickel-plated metal
tubes, fitted to slide within each other, and held together by a
metal framework or connections, said tubes containing glasslenses properly fitted therein, and that said tubes are enclosed
in a cover of polished mother-of-pearl; that the shell, when
manufactured, or brought to the proper shape for such cover
and properly polished, costs more than the glass lenses and
metal tubes and frame when finished and ready to be combined with said pearl to make a complete opera glass."
In this connection, our attention is called to the fact that,
while an exception was taken to the ruling of the court with
respect to goat skins, none was taken to its rulings with
respect to the opera glasses. This, however, is immaterial, no
exception being necessary, in case of special findings by the
court, to raise the question whether the facts found support
the judgment. St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423, 428;
Tyng v. Grinnell, 92 U. S.467, 469; Insurance Co. v. Boon,
95 U. S.117, 125; Allen v. St. Louis Bank, 120 U. S.20, 30.
The court below was of opinion that, taking the designation
of "shells, whole or parts of, manufactured," found in Schedule N, page 514, in connection with the last clause of Rev.
Stat. § 2499, that "on all articles manufactured from two or
more materials the duty shall be assessed at the highest rates
at which the component material of chief value be chargeable,
these opera glasses should have been classified as manufactured
shells, inasmuch as it appeared that the shell, when manu-

factured or brought to the proper shape for such covering and
properly polished, costs more than the glass lenses and metal
tubes and framework, when finished ready to be combined
with said material to make a complete opera glass." *We held
this method of computation to be correct in Seeberger v. Hardy,
150 U. S. 420, but the question of the proper classification of
the opera glasses was not considered in that case.
We think the court was in error in holding that the articlesin question were shells, whole or parts of, manufactured, as
this clause was obviously intended to apply to articles made
entirely, or nearly so, of shell, such as combs, bracelets, chains,
and lorgnons, and not to articles of which shell was a mere
component, though perhaps, as in this case, the most valuable
part. Nor are we satisfied that, they should be classed as
"articles manufactured from two or more materials," in which
case, by Rev. Stat. § 2499, as amended by the act of 1883,
(22 Stat. 491,) duty should be assessed at the highest rate at
which the component material of chief value may be chargeable. In view of the more specific designation in Schedule
C, page 501, of "manufactures, articles, or wares not specially
enumerated or provided for in this act, composed wholly or
in part of

.

metal," and in view of the fact that,

while the metal is not the component of chief value, it is a
substantial part of the finished glass, and the framework upon
which the lenses and shell are mounted, we think these articles
should be classed as manufactures of metal. We do not wish
to be understood as holding that, if the metal be a mere incident or an immaterial part of the completed article, as, for
instance, the screws or knobs upon an article of household
furniture, or the buttons upon an article of clothing, such
articles should be classified as manufactures in part of metal;
but where, as in this case, they form a necessary and substantial part of the article, we think this clause should determine their classification. Particularly is this so in view of
the fact that opera glasses are frequently made of glass and
metal alone, or with an outer covering of leather, which would
form an inconsiderable part of the total expense. It would
be obviously unjust that these cheaper glasses should pay a

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

duty of forty-five per cent while the more expensive glasses
with shell coverings are dutiable only as manufactures of shell
at twenty-five per cent.
Practically the same question was before this court in
Solonon v. Arthur, 102 U. S. 208, in which the question arose
as to the proper classification of goods composed of silk and
cotton. The collector laid a duty upon them as "manufactures of silk or of which silk is the component part of chief
value, not otherwise provided for;" and the question was
whether they were "otherwise provided for " as" manufactures
composed of mixed materials, in part of cotton, silk, wool or
worsted, or flax." The goods in question were confessedly
embraced in both descriptions; but as "manufactures made
of mixed materials, in part, of cotton, silk," etc., was more
general than that of "manufactures in which silk is the component part of chief value," the two phrases were interpreted
to read as follows: "Goods made of mixed materials, cotton,
silk, etc., shall pay a duty of thirty-five per cent; but if silk
is the component part of chief value, they shall pay a duty
of fifty per cent." So by analogy we may read the two
clauses in question in this case as follows: "On all articles
manufactured from two or more materials the duty shall be
assessed at the highest rates at which the component material
of chief value may be chargeable, provided that if such
articles are composed wholly or in part of metal, they shall be
dutiable at forty-five per cent." So in Hartracjft v. .Xeyer,
135 U. S. 237, the question was whether cloth composed
partly of silk, partly of cotton, and partly of wool, silk being
the component material of chief value, should be classified
as "manufactures of wool of every description, made wholly
or in part of wool, not specially enumerated or provided for
in this act," or as "goods, wares, and merchandise, not
specially enumerated or provided for in this act, made of silk,
or of which silk is the component material of chief value." It
was held that, as the latter clause was narrower and more
limited than the other, they should be classified as silk goods.

SEEBERGER v. SCHLESINGER.
Opinion of the Court.

clasps, the paper being worth more than all the rest of the
materials put together, were held not to be liable to duty as
"manufactures and articles of leather, or of which leather
shall be a component part," but as manufactures of paper,
or of which paper was the component material of chief value
not specially enumerated or provided for. The case was held
to be determined by Revised Statutes, section 2499, as amended
by the act of M arch 3, 1883, that "on all articles manufactured
from two or more materials the duty shall be assessed at the
highest rates of which the component material of chief value
may be chargeable." As the evidence distinctly showed that
the paper was the component material of chief value, the
albums were held to be assessable as manufactures of paper.
In this case the two clauses were practically the same, one
being of "manufactures and articles of leather, or of which
leather shall be a component part, not specially enumerated;"
and the other "paper; manufactures of, or of which paper is
a component material, not specially enumerated." As the
articles were made both of leather and paper, and were
assessable with equal propriety under the one clause or the
other, the court called to its aid section 24199, and held the
article to be assessable at the highest rates at which the component material of chief value, to wit, the paper, was chargeable. If there had been in the statute such a provision with
regard to articles manufactured wholly or in part of shell as
there is with regard to articles manufactured wholly or in
part of metal, this case would be decisive, but there is no
necessity of relying upon section 2499 to aid us in the interpretation of the clauses in question here.
The views of the courts of the different circuits have not
been uniform with respect to the classification of these glasses,
but we agree with the district judge in the case of Aloe v.
Churchill, 44 Fed. Rep. 50, that they should be classed as
manufactures composed in part of metal under Schedule 0,
and, therefore, dutiable at forty-five per cent.
The judgment of the court below is, therefore,
Reversed, and the case remandedfor furtherproceedings in
conformity with this opinion.
