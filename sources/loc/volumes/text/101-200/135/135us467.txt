UPSHUR COUNTY v. RICH.
APPEAL

FROm

THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE DISTRICT OF' WEST VIRGINIANo. 81. Submitted November 7, 1889.-Decided April 14, 1890.

An appeal, under a state law, from an assessment of taxes to "a, county
court," which, fin respect to such proceedings, acts, not as a judicial
body, but as a board of commissioners, without judicial powers, only
authorized to determine questions of quantity, proportion and value, is
not a." suit" which can be removed from the county court into a Circuit
Court of the United States, and be heard and determined there.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

-Mr.Alfred Caldwell, for appellant, submitted on his brief,
No appearance for appellees.
MR.

JUSTICE BRADL

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Rich and others, the appellees, owned a tract of wild land
in Upshur County, West Virginia, the exterior boundaries of
which are supposed to contain 100,000 acres, and it was assessed for taxation for the year 1883 as containing 100,000.
acres, at four dollars per acte. The owners, considering this
assessment too high, applied to the county court of Upshur
county for a reduction, and after giving notice to the prosecuting attorney for the county, on. the 6th [of November,
188S, filed the following petition:
"To the honorable the county court of the county of
"Upshur, in the State of West Virginia:
?'The petition of Benjamin Rich, William F. 'Reynolds and
George W. Jackson respectfully shows unto your honors that
your petitioners are the owners in fee-simple of a certain tract
of land lying artly in said county of Upshur and in tie
adjoining -counties of Randolph and Braxton, but mostly in
Upshur county, the exterior boundaries of which tract are

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

said to contain 100,000 acres; that said tract of land has been
charged and assessed on the land books of the proper district
of the said county of Upshur for taxation for the year 1883 as
containing 100,000 acres, whereas there are various parcels of
land lying within said exterior boundaries which are properly
to be deducted from the area therein, and thereby reduce the
quantity to be charged to your petitioners for taxation.
"And your petitioners further show that the assessment
of said tract of land on said land books is at a valuation of
$400,000, which they charge is unjust, extravagant, excessive
and illegal, and, as compared with the valuation of lands of
like charabter in said county, wild and unimproved, the said
valuation of said tract "of 100,000 acres is grossly above and
beyond that of adjacent lands.
"Your petitioners therefore pray that the State of West
Virginia and the county of Upshur may be made parties defendant to this their petition, and that the said erroneous and
illegal assessment be corrected and the quantity charged them,
as aforesaid, reduced; "alid they will ever pray, etc."
On the same day they filed a petition for the removal of
the case to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of West Virginia, alleging themselves to be citizens of
Pennsylvania, and that the State of West Virginia and County
of Upshur, in the said State, were necessary parties to the
said controversy. The .petition was grounded upon an affidavit of one of the parties that, from prejudice and local influence, the petitioners would not be able to obtain justice in
the state court. The county court refused to order a removal;
but on a petition being presented to the Circuit Court of the
United States, with a transcript of the proceedings, that court
took cognizance of the case, and denied a motion to remand it
to the county court.
Thereupon the county court of Upshur County, by two of
its members, (being a majority of the court,) filed a plea to
the jurisdiction, alleging for cause, that the application of the
petitioners for relief in the county court was not a suit, and did
not involve a controversy between a citizen of West Virginia
and a citizen of any other State; and that, as to the taxes

UPSHUR COUNTY v. RIIHL
Opinion of the Court.

belonging to the State, the county court was merely the organ, under the law of West Virginia, to act upon the matter
of relief asked for; and the same as to the taxes belonging to
the county; and that neither the county nor the State was a
party, by process or otherwise, to the said application.
This plea was rejected on motion of the petitioner.
Afterwards the case was, heard, and the Circuit Court made
the following decree:
"Benjamin IRich, W. F. Reynolds, and George W. Jackson
County of Upshur.
"Upon application to correct an erroneous assessment of lands
in the county of Upshur, West Virginia, removed into this
court December, 1883.
"This cause having been regularly docketed in this court,
this day came the said Benjamin Rica, Win. F. Reynolds, and
George W. Jackson, by their attorneys, and the said county
of Upshur, in the State of West Virginia, by Messrs. John
Brannon and A. M. Poundstone, who represent the county of
Upshur and the prosecuting attorney for said county, and it
appearing to the court that the application for correction of
the assessment herein complained of was made within the
time prescribed by law, to wit, on the 16th day of April, 1883,
and that the prosecuting attorney had due notice thereof, and
the court, having heard the evidence and seen and inspected
the papers and records in the cause, and heard the arguments
"
of counsel thereon, upon mature consideration, doth find
The court then finds the assessment erroneous ; that it should
have been for only 25,000 acres of land instead of 100,000,
and should have been at $2 per acre instead of $4 ; and
ordered it to be corrected accordingly; and decreed further
as follows:
"That said Benjamin Rich, Wm. F. Revnolds, and George
W. Jackson be, and they are hereby, relieved from the payment of so much and such part of the taxes and levies
extended for said years 1883 and 1884 as may and do exceed
the amount of taxes and levies proper to be assessed upon

said lands, as herein and hereby reduced in quantity and
value.
"And it is further ordered that copies of this order be certified by the clerk of this court to the county court of Upshur
County, the sheriff of said county, the assessor of the first
district thereof, and the auditor of West Virginia; and it is
further ordered that no costs be taxed for or against either
party."
This is the decree appealed from; and the principal objection taken to it is, that the case was not properly removable
from the state court to the Circuit Court of the United States.
This objection is sought to be sustained on two distinct
grounds:
1. That the case is not a suit within the meaning of the
removal act;
2. That if it is a suit, within the said act, the State of West
Virginia is a necessary party to it.
The act under which the case was removed was the third
clause of section 639 of the Revised Statutes, which declares:
"Third: When a suit is between a citizen of the State in
which it is brought and a citizen of another State, it may be
so removed on the petition of the latter, whether he be plaintiff or defendant, . . . if . . . he makes and files
an affidavit, stating that he has reason to believe, and does
believe, that, from prejudice or local influence, he will not be
able to obtain justice in such State Court."
It must be "a suit" between citizens of different States. Is
this such a suit? We do not see how it can be called such.
The original petition made the State of West Virginia and
the county of Upshur parties defendant; and the petition of
removal alleged that the State and county were necessary
parties to the controversy. lf, therefore, the proceeding
could be called a-suit at all, it was a suit against the State as
well as the county, and such a suit is not within the category
of removable cases. A State is not a citizen, if a county is.
But is an appeal from an assessment of property for taxation a suit within the meaning of the law? In ordinary cases
i certainly is not. By the laws of all or most of the States,

UPSHUR COUNTY v. RICH.
Opinion of the Court.

tax-payers are allowed to appeal from the assessment of their
property by the assessor to some tribunal conistituted for that
purpose, sometimes called a board of commissioners of appeal;
sometimes one thing and sometimes another. But whatever
called, it is not usually a court, nor is the proceeding a suit between parties; it is a matter of administration, and the duties
of the tribunal are administrative, and not judicial in thie ordinary sense of that term, though often involving the exercise
of quasi-judicial functions. Such appeals are not embraced in
the removal act.
In this respect the law of West Vnginia does not differ from
that of most other States. It is true that the tribunal of appeal
is called the "county court," but it has no judicial powers
except in matters of probate. In all other matters it is an' administrative board, charged with the management of county
affairs. It formerly had general judicial powers, but by an
amendment to the constitution of West Virginia adopted in
1880, in place of the VIIIth article of the Constitution of 1872,
it was provided as follows:
"22. There shall be in each county of the State a county
court, composed of three commissioners, and two of said commissioners shall be a quorum for the transaction of business.
It shall hold four regular sessions in each year, at such times
as may be fixed upon and entered of record by the said court.
Provisions may. be made by law for holding special sections of
said court."
To this court (so called) was given the custody of the county
records, and it was further declared that "They shall have jurisdiction in all matters of probate,
the appointment and qualification of personal representatives,
guardians, committees, curators, and the settlement of their
accounts, and in all matters relating to apprentices. They
shall also, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law,
have the superintendence and administration of the internal
police and fiscal affairs of -their counties, including the establishment and regulation of roads, ways, bridges, public land.

judge of the election, qualification and returns of their own
members, and of'all county and district officers, subject to such
regulations, by appeal or otherwise, as may be prescribed by
law. Such courts may exercise such other powers and perform such other duties, not of a judicial nature, as may be

prescribed by law."
Under the power given by the last clause, the legislature of
the State on the 21d of February, 1883, passed an act by which,
amongst other things, it was declared as follows:
"(7.) Any person feeling himself aggrieved by the assessment of his real estate, made under provisions of this act, may,
within one year after the filing of a copy of such assessment
with the clerk of the county court, apply, by, himself or his
agent, to the said court for redress, first giving reasonable
notice in writing of his intention to the prosecuting attorney,
and stating in such notice the character of the correction he
desires. It shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney, upon
being so notified, to attend to the interests of the State, at the
trial of such application. If, upon hearing the evidence offered, the county court shall be of opinion that there is error
in the assessment complained of, or that the valuation fixed by
the commissioners is excessive, the said court shall make such
order correcting the said assessment as is just and proper."
Acts of W. Va., 1883, c. 72, p. 104.
It was under this law that the appeal from the assessment
in the present case was taken. In our judgment it was not a
suit within the meaning of the removal act- though approaching very near to the line of demarcation. We cannot
believe that every assessment of property belonging to the citizen of another State can be removed into the federal courts.
Certainly the original assessment, made by the township or
county assessors, could not be called a suit, and could not be
thus removed; and there is, justly, no more reason for placing
an assessment on appeal within that category. It is nothing
but an assessment in either ease, which is an administrative
act. The -fact that the board of appeal may swear witnesses
does not make the proceeding a suit. Assessors are often
empowered- to do this without altering the character of their
functions.

"UPSHUR COUNTY v. IRICH.
Opinion of the Court.

This view is in accord with that of the Supreme Court of
Appeals of West Virginia. In the case of A. A. Zow et al. v.
County Court of Lincoln County,. 27 W. Va. 785, they held
that no appeal lies from a judgment of the county court
rendered under the section above quoted, refusing to correct
the assessed valuation on laud; and that such judgment can be
reviewed, if at all, only by'certiorari. In Pittsburg, Cincnnati etc. .Railway Co. v. Board of Publlc Works, 28 W. Va. 264,
270, they held that where the board 6f public works fixed the
valuation of the property of a railroad company under the
statutes, it simply acted as a county assessor does'in assessing the property of individuals; and that the acts of both are
merely ministerial, and not judicial in any proper sense of the
term. After referring to a number of authorities on the subject, the court says: "These authorities establish, beyond the
propriety of controversy, that the action 'and decision of a
designated officer or board, whether the same be a court or
other-body, in reviewing and correcting an assessment of corporate or other property for taxation, are no more judicial acts
than the acts of the officer or authority making the original
assessment. They also show that the decision or finding of
such officer or board, even if the same be a court or other
judicial tribunal, is not such a judicial act or judgmpent as can
be reviewed by a supreme or appellate court possessing judicial powers only."
In these views we concur. At the same time we do not lose
sight of the .fact, presented by every day's experience, that
the legality and constitutionality of taxes and assessments may
be subjected to judicial examination in various ways,- by an
action against the collecting officer, by a bill for injunction, by
certiorawi, and by other modes of proceeding. Then, indeed,
a suit arises which may come within the cognizance of the
federal courts, either by removal thereto, or by writ of error
from this court, according to the nature and circumstances of
the case. Even an apteal from an assessient, if referred to a
court and jury, or merely to a court, to be proceeded in according to judicial methods, may become asuit within the act of
Congress. But the ordinary acts and doings of assessors, or of

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

appellate boards of assessors, in passing upon matters of mere
valuation, apprasement or proportionate distribution of expense, belong to a different class of governmental functions,
executive and administrative in their character, and not appertaining to the judicial department. If an illegal principle of
valuation be adopted, or an unconstitutional assessment or tax
be made or imposed, or fraud be practised, it may be examined by one of the judicial methods referred to, and thus
become the subject of a suit.
The question what is a "suit" in the sense of the judiciary
laws of itle United States has been frequently considered by
this- court, Reference may be made particularly to the following cases: Weston v. City of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464;
Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524; Holmes v. Jennison, 14
Pet. 540, 566; Ex parte -Milligan,4 Wall. 2, 112; Kohl v.
United States, 91 U. S. 367, 375 ; Gaines v. Fuentes, 92 U. S.
10, 21, 22; Boom Company v. Patterson, 98 U. S. 403, 406;
.Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485, 497; Hess v.. Reynolds, 113
U. S. 73, 78 ; PacificRailroadRemoval Cases, 115 U. S. 1, 18;
Searl v. School District, 124 U. S. 197, 196 ; Delaware County
v. Diebold Safe Co., 133 U. S. 473, 486, 487.
In the four cases first cited this court determined that writs
of prohibition, mandamus and habeas corpus, prosecuted for
the attainment of the parties' rights, are suits within the
meaning of the law, the judgments upon which, in proper
cases, may be removed into this court by writ of error. In
Weston v. City of Charleston Chief Justice Marshall said : "Is
a writ of prohibition a suit? The term is certainly a very
comprehensive one, and is understood to apply to any proceeding in a court of justice by which an individual pursues.
that remedy in a court of justice which the law affords him.
The modes of proceeding may be various, but if a right is litigated between parties in a court of justice, the proceeding by
which the decision of the court is sought is a suit." This
definition is quoted with approbation by Chief Justice Taney
in FEolme v. Jennison, which was a case of habeas coTpus, and
by other judges in subsequent cases.
Boom Company v. Patterson, Paijfo Railroad Removal

OPSHUR COUNTY v. RICH.
Opinion of the Court.

Cases, and Searl v. Sciwol -Districtwere cases of the assessment
of the value of lands condemned for public use under the
power of eminent domain. The general rule with regard to
cases of this sort is, that the initial proceeding of appraisement
by commissioners is an administrative proceeding, and not a
suit ; but that if an appeal is taken to a court, and a litigation
is there instituted betweeni patties, then it becomes a suit
within the meaning of this act of Congress. In Boom Company v. Patterson the company was authorized by the state
laws of Minnesota to take land for the purpose of its business,
and to have commissioners appointed to appraise its value. If
their award was not satisfactory, either to the company or to
the owner of the land, an appeal lay to the district court,
where it was to be entered by the clerk "as a case upon the
docket," the land owner being designated as plaintiff and the
company as defendant. The court was then required to proceed to hear and determine thie case in the same manner that
other cases were heard and determined. Issues of fact were
to be tried by a jury, unless a jury was waived. The value of
the land being assessed by the jury or the court, as the case
might be, the amount of the assessment was to be entered as a,
judgment against the company, subject to review by the supreme
court of the state on writ of error. This mode of prqceeding
-was followed. The Boom Company and the land owner both
appealed from the. award of the commissioners. When the
case was brought before the District Court, the owner, being a
citizen of another state, applied for and obtained its removal
to the Circuit Court of the United States, where it was tried
before a jury and a judgment.was rendered upon their award.
We held that the appeal in that 6ase was a suit within the
meaning of the act of Congress authorizing the removal of
causes from the state to the federal courts. Mr. Justice Field,
speaking for the court, said: "The proceeding in the present,
case before the commissioners appointed to appraise the land
was in the nature of an inquest to ascertain its value, and not
a suit at law in the ordinary sense of those terms. But when
it was transferred to the. District Court by appeal from the
award of the commissioners, it took, under the statute of the.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

state, the form of a suit at law, and was thenceforth subject to
its ordinary ruleg and incidents."
In .Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co. it was held that
where a claim against a county is heard before county commissioners, though the proceedings are, in some respects, assimilated to proceedings before a court, yet they are not in the
nature of a trial inter partes, but are merely the allowance or
disallowance, by county officers, of a claim against the county,
upon their own knowledge, or upon any proof that may be
presented to them; but that an appeal from their decision,
tried and determined by the Circuit Court of the county, is a
suit removable to the Circuit Court of the United States.
In .Kohl v. United States the whole proceeding for condemnation of land as a site for a post-office was held to be a
suit. Mr. Justice Strong, delivering the opinion of the court,
said: "It is difficult to see why a proceeding to take land in
virtue of the government's eminent domain, and determining
the compensation to be made for it, is not, within the meaning of the statute, a suit at common law, when initiated in a
court." This view of the proceeding as a whole, instituted and
concluded in a court, and analogous to the proceeding of ad'
'uod damnum at common law, perhaps, distinguished this case
from the other cases before referred to.
Two of the other cases cited, Gaines v. Tfuentes and E-7is v.
Davis, arose out of proceedings to set aside the probate of
wills; and although the granting of probate of a will is not
ordinarily a suit, yet, if a contestation arises, and is carried on
between parties litigating with each other, the proceeding then
becomes a suit. As observed by Mr. Justice Matthews, speak.
ing for the court in Ellis v. Davis, "Jurisdiction as to wills,
and their probate as such, is neither included in, nor excepted
out of, the grant of judicial power to the courts of the United
States. So far as it is ex'yarte and merely administrative, it is
not conferred, and it cannot be exercised by them at all until,
in a case at law or in equity, its exercise becomes necessary to
sietle a controversy of which a court ofthe United States. may
take cognizance by reason of the citizenship of the parties."
Similar views were expressed by Mr. Justice Miller in Hess v.

UPSHUR COUNTY v. RICI.
Opinion of the Court.

Reynolds, which was the case of a creditor instituting proceedings in a probate court against the estate of his deceased
debtor, and then removing them into the Circuit Court of the
United States.
The principle to be deduced from these cases is, that a proceeding, not in a court of justice, but carried on by executive
officers in the exercise of their proper functions, as in the valuation of property for the just distribution of taxes or assessments, is purely administrative in its character, and cannot, in
any just sense, be called a suit; and that an appeal in such a
case, to a board of assessors or commissioners having io judicial powers, and o1ly authorized to determine questions of
quantity, proportion and value, is not a suit; but that such an
appeal may become a suit, if made to a court or tribunal
having power to determine questions of law and fact, either
with or without a jury, and there are parties litigant to contest the case on the one side and the other.
Applying this principle to the facts of the present case, it
does not seem difficult to come to a decision. We have seen
that, although the appeal from the assessment was made to
the "county court" eo nomine, yet that this is not a judicial
body, invested with judicial functions, except in matters of
probate; but is the executive or administrative board of the
county, charged with the management of its financial and executive affairs. According to the principles laid down by the
state court, the acts of this board, in matters of taxation, are
as purely administrative as are those of the county assessors
in making the original assessment. Although we are not concluded by this decision, it is so much in harmony with our own
decisions on the same subject that we accept it as correct.
According to these views the proceeding below was not
properly removable to the circuit court of the United States,
and ought to have been remanded to the state court.
The decree of the circuit court is
Reversed and the cause remanded with instructionsto remand
the same to the state court.ftr-r- which. it was removed.
