delivered the opinionof the court.

This is a suit in equity, brought in the Circui Court of
the United States for the :Northern District of Illinois, on
the 11th of December, 1882, by the Cinmercial Manufacturing Coinpany, Consolidated, a New York corporation, and
The National Dairy Company, an'Ohio corporation, against
the Faiibank Cajnning Company, an Illinois corporation, for
the infringemdfit of reissued letters patent, No. 10,137, granted
June IM8, 1882, on an application- filed May 20, 1882, to the
Commetceial Manufacturing Company, Consolidated, for an
improvement in treating animal fats. The original patent,
No. 146,012, was granted December 30, 1873, having been
applied for December 13, 1873, to Hippolyte ]M6hge, as in-,

ventor. It was assigned to the United StatesDairy Company,
and was reissued to that company as No. 8,24, September 24,

1878. That reissue was then assigned to one Remsen, who
assigned it to The Commercial Mfanufacturing Company,
Consolidated, to which reissue No. 10,137 was granted. The
:National Dairy Company was the exclusive licensee for the
State of Illinois, in which State the infringement was alleged
to have taken place.
IThe answer set up, among other defences, that the United
States patent had expired before the last reissue thereof was
granted, by reason of the expiration of certain foreign patents'
granted to Mi[ge for the same invention; that the last reissue
was invalid; and that the defendant did not infringe.
So much of the specification of reissue No. 10,137 as is
important in the present case is as follows: "Be it known
that Hippolyte M ge, of Paris, France, now deceased, chemist
manufacturer, did invent an improved means for transforming
animal fat into butter, of which the following is a specification: This invention, which i% the result of physiological
investigations, consists of artificially producing the natural'
work which is performed by the cow when it reabsorbs its fat
in order to transform the same into butter. The improved
means he employed for this purpose are as follows:
"L Neutralization of the ferments. In order to prevent
the greasy substance which is settled in' the tissue of the ani;
mals from taking the disagreeable. taste of the fat, it is
necessary that the' ferments which. produce this taste shall
be completely neutralized. For this effect, as soon as possible
after the death of the animal; he plunged the raw fats, called
'graisses en branches,'. into water containing fifteen per cent
of sea salt and one per cent of sulphite, of soda. He began
thus the transformation an hour, at least, after the immersion,
and twelve hours, at most, afterward.
"II. Crushing. A complete crushing is necessary in order
to obtain rapid work without alteration. For this purpose,
when the substance is coat ely crushed, he let it fall from
the cylinders under millstones, which completely bruise all the.
cells.
VOL. exxxv-12

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

"II. Concentrated digestion. The crushed fat falls into a
vessel which is made of well-tinned iron or enamelled iron or
baked clay. This vessel must be plunged in a water bath of
which the temperature is raised at will. When the fat has
descended in the vessel he melted it by means of an artificial
digestion, so that the heat does not exceed 1030 Fahrenheit,
and thus no taste of fat is produced. For this purpose he
thiew into the wash-tub containing the artificial gastric juice
about two litres per hundred kilograms of greasy substance.
This gastric juice is made with the half of a stomach of a pig
or sheep, well washed, and three litres of water containing
thirty grams of biphosphate of lime. After a maceration during three hours he passed the substance through a fine sieve,
and obtained the two litres which are necessary for a hundred kilograms. He slowly raised the temperature to about
103' F., so that the matter shall completely separate. This
greasy matter must not have any taste of fat. It must, on the
contrdry, have the taste of molten butter. When the liquid
does not present any more lumps he threw into the said liquid
one kilogram of sea salt (reduced to powder) per hundred kilograms of greasy matter. He stirred during a quarter of an
hour and let it set until obtaining perfect limpidness. This
method of extraction has a considerable advantage over that
which has been previously essayed. The separation is well
made and the organized tissues which do deposit are not
altered.
"IV. Crystallization in a mass. In order to separate the
oleomargarine from the stearine, separate crystallizers or crystallizations at unequal temperatures have been already employed: He contrived for this purpose the followiiig method,
which produces a very perfect separation, and is as follows:
He rendered the molten fat in a, vessel which must be sufficient for containing it. This vessel is placed in a wash-tub of
strong wood, which serves as a water bath. In this wash-tub
he put water at the fixed temperature of 860 F., for the soft
fats proceeding from the slaughter-house, and 980 for the
harder fats, such as mutton fat. Afterward the wash-tubs are
covered, and after a certain time, more or less long according

COMMERCIAL IP'YG CO. v. FAIRBANK CO.

Opinion of the Court,

to the fats, the stearine is deposited in the form of teats in
the middle of the oleomargaric liquid.
"V. Separation by centrifugal force. In order to avoid
the numerous, inconveniences of the employment of the
presses which have been hitherto used, he caused the mixture
of stearine and oleomargarine to flow into a centrifugal
machine called 'hydro-extractor.' The greasy liquid passes
through the cloth and the stearine is collected. When all the
liquid is passed he put the machine in notion,,and the crystals
of stearine are entirely exhausted without the auxiliary of the
presses. However, during certain seasons there are animals
which produce crystals of stearine soft enough for rendering
necessary the stroke of a press as a last operation, but in this
case this operation has little importance, because it is applied
only to a fraction of the product. In all cases the oleomargarine is separated from the stearine when it is cold, and passed
to the cylinder, constituting, especially if its yellow color has
been raised, a greasy matter of very good taste, and which may
replace the butter in the kitchen, where it is employed under
the name of 'margarine;' but, if it is desired to transform it
into more perfect butter, he employed the following means."
The claims in that reissue are as follows: "1. The improved
material herein described, produced by treating animal fats so
as to remove the tissues and other portions named, with or
without the addition' of substances, to change the flavor;
consistency, or color, as set forth. 2. The process herein
described of treating animal fats in the production of oleomargarine."
The claims of reissue No. 5868 were six in number, and those
of reissue No. 8124 were nine in number; while the claims of
the original patent and of reissue No. 10,13 were iden.ical in
number and language.
After a replication to the answer, proofs were talo. ,anu
the case was heard before Judges Gresham and Blodgett. The
opinion of the court, delivered by the latter, is found in 27 Fed.
Rep. 78; and, in accordance with its conclusions, a decree
was entered, on the 22d of March, 1886, dismissing the bill.
From that decree the plaintiffs hai-e appealed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

ground for the dismissal was, that the Bavarian patent,
which was granted April 8, 1873, expired April 8, 1876; that
the Austrian patent, which was granted October 31, 1869,
expired May 26,. 1876;' and that, therefore, reissue No. 10,137
was invalid, because the application on which it was granted
was not made until May 20, 1882. Ifge also took out a
patent in France for his invention, July 15, 1869, for fifteen
years. The defendant contends that the Bavarian and the
Austrian patents were granted for the same invention as reissue No. 10,137, while the plaintiffs allege the contrary.
The 'text of the specification of the Bavarian patent is as
follows:
"The crude fats and the crude tallow have, until the pres-The

ent time, been used in a very imperfect manner for the preparation of edible fat or soaps, or the fabrication of melted tallow

for the preparation of fatty acids, by means of chemical modes
of saponification or other purposes.
" "The new modes of procedure described herein consist both
of chemical and physiological processes; they are not intended
to improve the former methods of fabrication, but, on the
contrary, on account of their nature and better properties,
furnish'neutral and new products. They are especially intended to benefit the navy and the less wealthy classes, by
furnishing excellent edible and preservable fats at a price
considerably lower than that of present similar products, - for
instance, butter and. the finer grades of fats.
I"The reduction in the price of butter will, in a large
measure, contribute to the general wealth, for stock-raisers,
instead of making butter, will feed their milk to calves and
thereby get more stock, thus furnishing more cattle for slaughtering purposes and at a lower price. The new procedure
is also of considerable importance, from a hygienic point of
view, in doing away with the emanation of bad odors inevitable with the former chemical methods, and due to the excessive high temperature to which fats had been exposed.
The new procedure dependi upon the following conclusions
of modern science: 1, That the malodorous, colored, acid and
rancid ingredients are not originally contained in the crude

COMMERCIAL M'F'G CO. v. FAIRBA K. CO.
Opinion of the Court.

fats as they occur in nature; 2, That these harmful substances
*are developed by the activity of the organized tissues under
the influence of fermentation, heat and chemical agents; 3,
That the fats of milk, termed butter, consist only of the immediate fat, which is altered first by a cellular tissue and then
by the organized tissue of the udder. By utilizing these principles in industrial pursuits, or in domestic economy, there is
obtained from the crude fats and ,he-tallow"A. A pure fat, without the customary fatty smell and
taste, which does not stick to the palate, and which resembles
the fatty bodies most desired for eating purposes.
"B. Stearine for candles.
"0. As a residue, common tallow.
"D. This fat, really identical with the fat of butter, taken
from its source before it has been changed in the milk gland,
can be made into different kinds of butte, which, although
prepared by an artificial process, is really butter, and differs
only from the ordinary butter by keeping fresh for a much
longer length of time.
"The means employed in the new preparation of these
partly new, partly known, products constitute, in their details
and in their entirety, the invention which we claim as our
propert3. They are as follows:
" 1. Washing and crushing. The crude fat is exposed to a
jet of -old water between the conical cogs on two iron cylinders; it is finely subdivided by the current of water and the
pressure, and falls thence into a tank, where a current of
cold water completes the washing.
"2. Artificial digestion. This fat, now freed from all soluble animal substances, is mixed with artificial gastric juice,
(stomach of the pig or sheep in acidulated water,) to the extent of immersing it completely, or to 1000 kilo. of fat, 300
kilo. of water, one kilo. bicarbonate of sodium, and two stomachs (pig or sheep) are added. This mixture is then.kept at the
temperature of the animal body, (by means of steam-pipes, or
otherwise,) until all the molten fat has been dissolved by the
pepsin of the stomachs, and appears in a clear layer on the.
surface. It is allowed to settle, or it is decanted, and the

pr9cess repeate , in order to extract all the fatty constituents,
which now have lost the odor of animal fat, but have obtained
a particular taste. The residue is tallow.
"3. Cooling. The fluid fat is pQured into vessels which
have an opening at the bottom and contain a layer of tepid
water. They are covered, and when crystallization has occurred in consequence of cooling, the water is drawn off
through the opening, the vessel is inverted and the cake is
allowed to fall on a table.
"14. Pressure. This operation is intended to separate the
hard constituent which makes the fat granular, congeal
rapidly, and stick to the palate. The cooled fat is cut into
slices about one inch thick, and put into a cloth between hot
plates of a press. The portion which.runs off is a mixture of
margarine and oleine, resembling lard in composition, and of
about the taste of fresh butter. It melts in the mouth like
butter and does not stick to the palate like beef fat. The
solid residue taken out of the cloth is good stearine, fit for
making candles immediately.
"5. Uniformity and ductility. In order to remove the
granular appearance of the margarine produced by congelation, and to give it the solid and uniform appearance usually
possessed by fats, and in order, also, to remove any air which
may have entered and might interfere with its preservation,
without admitting air again, a vessel is filled with the fat,
completely closed, and a churning or stirring apparatus in its
interior is set into motion. The margarine is thus kept in.
motion and is then withdrawn from the vessel before cooling.
It is now hard or even brittle, according to the temperature.
It is rendered soft and ductile by rolling it between wooden
cylinders. It is put into the form of plates or filled in tubs to
be put in the market.
"6. Decolorization. The first fat is ordinarily of a light
yellow color. If it is desired to remove this color without
-attacking the fat, the property which the fat possesses of remaining fluid for some time before cooling can be utilized.
In this state an acid - for instance, muriatic acid - is added
in s i~ient quantity to remove the color, and it is then

CO MERCIAL I'F'G CO. v. FAIRBANK CO.
Opinion of the Court.

washed with tepid water until the last trace of acid has disappeared.
"This entire procedure, with or without pressure, can be
applied to all crude fats.
"The white or faintly yellowish fat obtained by means of
the described -procedure is remarkably pure, and has a taste
of almonds, hitherto not known of any animal fat. It is especially available for"A. Food, as a substitute for animal fats and lard.
"B. For the fabrication of fine toilet soaps.
"0. The manufacture of ordinary soaps to replace the
olive oil.
"D. The lubrication of machinery, which is never attacked if
the one hundredth part of calcined magnesia be added to the fat.
"E. The artificial production of butter.
"'. Transformation into butter. The pure fat which has
undergone no change by heat or chemical agents is the same
substance which the cow consumes in its organism in order to
have it pass through the udder in the form of milk fat or
butter. The fat is, therefore, but butter in its original form.
This observation, and the observation that the milk gland of
a cow contains a kind of pepsin possessing the property of
making a milky emulsion of fat and water, are the basis of the
industrial procedure of changing fat into butter, a physiological operation to be carried out as follows:
"At the temperature of the animal body, one part of fat
is mixed with the same quantity of water, to Which g part
(two per cent milk cheese, or milk without water, or cream in
water) has been added, and with T- - part of carbonate of
sodium, and - part of the tissue of the mammary gland.
The mixture is kept at the temperature of the body and
allowed to work. When the fat becomes milky it appears at
first like a thick milky cream; later on it changes into butter,
which is allowed to cool with the precautions expLined in
articles 3 and 5. The gland tissue of the mixture can also be
replaced by artificial products, but with a less satisfactory
result. Butter thus prepared keeps longer than milk butter,
and does not, like the latter, acquire the pungent odor [due]

'Opinion of the Court.

to butyric acid, or it contains less caseine, insoluble in ether,
and may contain less water or buttermilk, as may be desired,
:than butter obtained in the usual manner.
"Since the above-described modes of procedure, dependent
on known and on unknown methods, are new in their industrial entirety and furnish new products, we claim them as our
exclusive property for the entire term of the patents.".
The text of the specification of the Austrian patent is as
follows :
"My invention consists in the production of neutral fatty
bodies of hitherto unknown natural appearance and excellent
properties. By means of special treatment of the crude tallow, I obtain a pure fat devoid of smell and taste, which does
not become rancid and which keeps for a long time. This substance I obtain through procedures partly known, partly new,
the entirety of which constitutes the following methods:
"1. Perfect washing. This is done by crushing the fresh
fat just taken from the animal between rollers under a spray
of fresh water. The fat, subdivided finely by the action of
the water and the pressure, falls into a tub, where the washing is completed by a current of water.
"2. Artificial digestion. This fat, from which all soluble
animal substances have been removed, is mixed with artificial
gastric juice, (maceration of a pig's stomach in acidulated
water,) in sufficient quantity to immerse it, and the mixture
is kept at the temperature of the animal body until the fat
appears as a clear layer on the surface. The mixture is
allowed to settle, and the sediment is subjected to another
operation, in order to extract all fatty matter, which in this
case has no longer the odor of animal fat, but the taste of
finest fats.
"3. Pressure. This operation separates the hard constituent which makes the fat granular and causes it to congeal
rapidly. This work, hitherto very difficult, is carried out on
a commercial scale, in the following manner: The fluid clear'
fat is poured into vessels with an opening at the bottom and
containing a layer of tepid water. They are covered, and
when the cooling and the crystallization have taken place the

COMMERCIAL M'F'G CO. v. FAIRBATK CO.
Opinion of the Court.

water is drawn off through the opening, the vessel is inverted,
and the mass allowed to fall upon" a table. It is cut into cakes
one. to two centimeters thick. These are put into canv'as and
pressed between two warm plates. By thi method there is
obtained about sixty per ceht of a fatty body resembling butter, and identical in composition with"lard, but free from odor
and of a perfectly pure taste. The solid portion remains in
the canvas.
"4. Uniform solidity is given to this fatty body in the following manner: In order to make ithard and, not granular,
without admitting air, it id poured into a tinned-iron vessel
filled thus completely. This well-closed vessel contains a stirring apparatus kept in motion frbm the outside. The vessel
is, besides, kept surrounded by cold water, so that the fat which
is being stirred, while cooling without the admission of air, becomes thick and uniform. It is then put into another vessel,
where it becomes completely solid and hard.
"This hard fat is finally cut or sliced into thin slices, by
some cutting machihe similar to the mechanical arrangement
used for cutting fine soaps, the blades being set to furnish thin
slices. This work, giving the fat the proper ductility, can alsq
be done by hand.
"5. Decolorization can be employed or omitted as desired.
This fat is usually of a yellow tinge. This color can he removed easily and without damage, by utilizing the property
of the fat of remaining fluid for some time in cooling. In this
state it is mixed with enough fine acid - for instance, muriatic
acid - to remove the color. It is then repeatedly washed with
warm water until the last trace of the acid has been removed.
"This entire procedure, with or without pressure, can be
employed in the case of any fresh fat just taken from the animal. By means of the same, I obtain partly solid partly soft,
white or faintly yellowish, perfectly pure fatty bodies, which
have a faint flavor of almonds. These new -fatty bodies are
applicable to various industrial purposes, according to their
degree of consistency, especially to "1. The fabrication of toilet soap, particularly fine and
beneficial to the skin.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

"2. The fabrication of ordinary soaps, to replace the olive
oil and give a large yield.
"3. The lubrication of machinery, which is never attacked
by this excellent lubricating material, especially when Tu part
of calcined magnesia has been added.
"I claim, therefore, as my invention, the above-described
mode of preparation of a wholly new fatty body. The peculiar points of importance of my procedure consist in washing,
digesting, pressing, solidifying and decolorizing."
It is contended by the plaintiffs that they have shown, by
the testimony of experts, that reissue No. 10,137 differs from
the foreign patents in these particulars: (1) The neutralization
of the ferments is entirely lacking in each foreign patent; (2)
Complete crushing is provided for in the United States patent,
so as to bruise all the fat cells, while the foreign patents do
not provide for such complete crushing, but do provide for
coarse- crushing and washing, both of which actions render
difficult, if not impossible, the production of the article which
is the result of the United States patent, and involve a different process; (3) Each of the foreign patents makes vital the
use of an artificial digestion, produced by a large proportion
of gastric juice, while the United States patent practically
dispenses with this gastric juice as an operative element in
the*process and product, and relies upon the slow increase of
temperature to produce complete separation; (4) Each foreign
patent directs the cooling of the product to solidification, so as
to be sliced into pieces to be pressed, while the United States
patent directs a crystallization at a uniform temperature,
above 86', leaving the oil fluia; and (5) Each foreign patent provides for the separation of oil from the stearine by pressing the
cold-sliced or solidified cakes between hot or warm plates, while
the United States patent separates the oil from the stearine
with the product at the temperature of uniform crystallization,
namely 86 ° . The contention is, that no step of the foreign
patents is found in the United States patent, nor any equivalent therefor;. and that the artificial digestion, the cooling
to solidification, and the pressing between hot plates found
in each of the foreign patents, is an absolute bar to the

CO]ARCIAL M'F'G CO. v. FAIRBANK CO.
Opinion of the Court.

production of the article which is the result of the United
States patent.
Professor Henry Morton, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, says: "There is, of course, a difference in the improved
-product described and claimed in the IM6ge patent, according
as it is made with or without the addition of materials affecting its color, consistency and flavor. I will, therefore, refer
to each of these conditions separately. When the improved
product of AI&ge, without these additions referred to, is compared with ordinary dairy butter, we find it to be substantially
identical therewith, as regards its main constituents and its
general consistency and character. Both products then consist substantially of mixtures in nearly the same proportions,
in either case, of stearine, margarine, and oleine, and both are
unctuous solids varying in consistency, being quite solid near
the melting point of ice, quite fluid at a temperature of
about 90° , and more or less soft and plastic at intermediate temperatures. The M ge product, however, differs from
dairy butter, in the first place, as to its composition,
by reason of the presence in the dairy butter of sdveral
substances not found in the Mkge product. Thus, the
dairy butter contains about five per cent to six per
cent of the peculiar fat known as butyrine it also contains
a smaller amount of caseine, some trace of albumen; also
extremely minute quantities of caprilin, caproilin and caprylin.
None of these substances would be present in the M6ge prod-'
uct, as above referred to, which would therefore lack the
peculiar flavor due to the presence of these products. The
amount of water and of salt would also, as a rule, be greater
in dairy butter than in the M6ge product.. There would also
be a difference in consistency, inasmuch as the dairy butter
would not constitute a homogeneous mass of 'fatty substance,
but would be a solid emulsion of such ,fatty substance, in
which the same existed as minute spheroids or particles of the
said fatty substance, separated from each other by an aqueous fluid consisting of water, holding in solution salt and
traces of albumen and caseine. When the AM6ge product has
been converted into a more perfect butter, as he calls it, by

OCTOBgR TEBR,

Opinion of the Court.

the addition of certain substances, as indicated by him, it will
then contain all or nearly all the materials found in dairy
butter, though not in exactly the same proportions, all these
distinctive matters being, as a rule, present in smaller proportions in the M6ge product than in the dairy butter. As
regards the water and salt, the relative proportions may vary
either way in different samples, depending upon the amount
of salt added and the amount of working to which the butter
of the IfMge product has been subjected. As regards consistency of the more perfect butter of the Mge patent and
ordinary dairy butter, there will be a substantial identity, both
being solid emulsions of fatty matter with an aqueous fluid.
. * As articles of food, the Mdge product and ordinary
dairy butter are only distinguishabil by characteristics which
are variations of degree. Thus the Mege product, in its
simplest form, would have less flavor and a less agreeable consistency than good dairy butter, while, on the other hand, its
freedom from disagreeable flavor would render it superior
to a low or poor grade of dairy butter. When the flavoring
materials were 'added, the M~ge product would then be extremely difficult to distinguish from the best dairy butter,
but, as compared with a very fine and highly flavored dairy
butter, would be lacking in flavor. As regards wholesomeness,
I do not think there would be any difference between the k ge
-product in either of its conditions and ordinary good dairy
butter, though the Mdge product would be better in this
respect than a strong or rancid quality of dairy butter. The
same remark applies to the nutritiousness of the materials
compared, while as regards palatableness the M6ge product
would, I think, hold an intermediate place between the highest and the lowest grades of dairy butter, being better than
the low grades and not quite equal to the highest in this
respect."
On the question of the identity of the Bavarian patent with
reissue No. 10,137, the opinion of the Circuit Court, after
quoting the text of the specification of the Bavarian patent,
says -"Here we have the directions of the Bavarian patent
for producing the Mgge product, consisting, first, of crushing

Opinion of the Court.

between cogged cylinders and washing, by which it is 'finely
subdivided.' The American patent says: 'A complete crushing is necessary under millstones! So that it would seem
there is only a difference in degree in the Bavarian and
American processes, as to the crushing. The American process says the fat must be completely crushed so as to bruise all
the cells. The Bavarian patent says it is to be finely subdivided
by the current of water and by crushing between the conical
cogs of iron cylinders. In both patents M6ge uses the word
'crushing' as a title or heading for his directions. The directions for the artificial digestion are the same for the two.patefnts,
except that in the Bavarian he does n6t instruct specifically how
to make the artificial gastric juice. He simply says it is 'the
stomach of the pig or sheep in acidulated water;' but the proof
in this case shows that themode of making artificial gastric
juice was well known in the arts before the date of M6ge's
invention, and he undoubtedly assumed that the person who
would attempt to use the process covered by his patent would
have sufficient physiological and chemical knowledge and skill
to make artificial gastric juice. The American patent also
states that the fat, while in the process of digestion, is to be
kept at a temperature of 1030 F., while the Bavarian patent
says it is to be the temperature of the animal body; but the
proof in 1his case shows that 103' F. is the temperature of
the animal body, so it would seem there is no substantial differeirce between the processes of digestion described in the
two patents. The third step in the Bavarian patent is entitled ' Cooling,' the process of which is pouring the clear liquid
fat into vessels which have an opening at the bottom, and containing a layer of tepid water, where they are covered and
remain until crystallization has occurred in consequence of the.
cooling. He does not give specific directions as to the temperature at which the fat is to be kept during the crystallizing
process, but evidently leaves that to the skill of the operator,
assuming that he will sufficiently understand by the use of the
word 'crystallization' what the process must be. The next
step after crystallization is the separation of the oleo and margarine from the crystallized stearine; and this in the Bavariar.'

Opinion of the Court.

patent is accomplished by pressure between the hot plates of
a press. Inasmuch as the centrifugal machine, or the hydro-'
extractor and"the press are analogous devices for accomplishing the same results,- that is, of expelling the liquid or fluid
contents from the mass, -there is no essential difference between'the Bavarian and American patents in this step of the
process. The Bavarian patent is also silent as to the neutralization of the ferments or germs of decay; but it can hardly
be possible that any person would enter upon the manipulation
of animal fat without sufficient common knowledge and skill'
to know, without instruction by the specific terms of the
patent, that, in order to produce sweet and pure oil or fat, the
process of fermentation and decay must be prevented. So
that, taking the Bavarian patent as a whole, there would
seem to be such an identity in the processes described as to
make them essentially the same. Probably because Mf6ge
assumed that whoever would attempt the transformation of
crude fats under his process in Bavaria would possess more
knowledge or experience in regard to the handling of fats
than he assumed would be known in this country, as a matter
of general knowledge, he deemed it necessary in his American
patent to give more minute and specific directions in regard to
some of the steps of the process than he did in his foreign
patents. Yet we think there can be no doubt that he has substantially described the same process in both patents."
In regard to the Austrian patent, the opinion of the Circuit
Court says: "In the Austrian patent issued to M ge, October
31, 1869, he describes the first process under the title of 'Perfeet washing,' which he says is done 'by crushing the fresh
fat just taken from the animal between rollers under a spray
of fresh water.' The second step, 'Artificial digestion,' consists ii mixing the crushed fat 'with artificial gastric juice,
(maceration of a pig's stomach in acidulated water,) in sufficient quantityr to immerse it, and the mixture is kept at the
temperature of the animal body until the fat appears as a
clear layer on the surface.' Here we have the same process
as in the American patent, except that the directions for
crushing do not include grinding or crushing under millstones,

COMMERCIAL M'F'G CO. v. FAIRBA.NK CO.
Opinion of the Court.

and he gives no recipe for making artificial gastric juice, except that of the maceration of a pig's stomach in acidulated
water, which we must infer he assumed was a sufficient direction to enable an ordinarily intelligent person, skilled in the
art of manipulating or handling fats, to make the gastric
juice. The directions for crystallization require the clear fluid
fat to be poured into a vessel with an opening at the bottom,
and containing a layer of tepid water. The vessel is then
covered, and, when the cooling and crystallization have taken
place, the cooled mass is turned out, cut in slices, and placed
in canvas bags and pressed between warm plates, by which
method he says there is obtained about sixty per cent of a
fatty body resembling butter, and identical in composition
with lard, but free from odor and of a perfectly pure taste."
The opinion then proceeds: "The French and the English
patents give substantially the same description for the process
as is contained in the Austrian and Bavarian patents. All the
steps of the American patent, with the exception of the neutralization of the ferments, are specifically called for and
described, although, perhaps, not with all the minute directions which are found in the American patent. All the proofs
agree that Mhge was a man of inventive genius and high
scientific acquirements, and it can hardly be possible that if,
between the time he took out the French, English and Austrian patents, in 1869, and the Bavarian patent, in April, 1873,
and the time when he applied for his American patent, in
December, 1873, he had discovered, any substantially new and
material addition to the process covered by those foreign
patents, he would not have specifically named and stated
wherein the American differed from the foreign patents. As
already said, it seems clear, from Mge's own statements, and
those of his solicitors, that the purpose was to cover by the
American patent what had been covered by his French patent
of 1869, and we cannot believe that, if anything in addition'
to this foreign patent bad been intended to be introduced into
the American patent, it would not have been stated in some
explicit terms; and there can be no doubt that the French,
Austrian and Bavarian patents are substantially identical."

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

In regard to the foreign patents, the opinion of the Circuit
Cburt says: "The scientific experts called by the complainant,
Professors Morton, Chandler and Wheeler, have testified that
they do not think the invention described in the American
patent is found in either of the foreign patents. Their reasons
for such conclusion, briefly summarized, are: (1)That the crushing spoken of in the foreign patents is not so complete and
thorough as that called for by the American patent, where
the fat is to fall from cylinders under millstones, which shall
completely bruise all the cells; (2) That in the American patent the digestion is to be accomplished with a less quantity of
gastric juice than is called for by the foreign patents, as the
foreign patents say the crushed fat is to be immersed in the
artificial gastric juice; (3)That by the American patent
'the temperature may be raised above 1030 F., 'so that the
matter shall completely separate,' while the foreign patents
limit the degree of heat to the temperature of the animal
body; (4) That in the foreign patents the process of cooling
is allowed to proceed to such a point that the mass can be
cut in pieces or slices, while in the American patent the
product is not allowed to cool so as to become rigid, but is
retained at a temperature of about 860.
"With all due respect to the opinions of these eminent
chemists, we must say that the points of difference suggested
by their testimony are purely and wholly differences in degree.
The necessity of crushing is stated in all the patents, both
American and foreign. The degree of crushing would, obviously affect the quantity of oil extracted from the fat by.
the. process of digestion, as the only object of the crushing is
to release the fat from the tissues in which it is held in its
natural: condition. The necessity for thorough and minute
comminution is one that would suggest itself from any operative's common knowledge. Any man who had intelligence
enough to know the uses of his own teeth would know the
necessity of the complete comminution of any article to be
subjected to the process of digestion or the action of the
gastric juice. It would hardly require a scientist to instruct
an operative that the more finely a substance is comminuted

COAMERCIAL M'F'G CO. v. FAIRBANK CO.
Opinion -of te

Court,

the more direct and prompt would be the action of the gastric
juice and the process of digestion.
"As to the differences in the process of digestion between
the American and foreign patents, it would seem to he true
that the measured quantity of gastric juice directed to be used
in the American patent is less than that called for in the foreign patents, because he gives specific directions as to the
number of litres of gastric juice for 100 kilogrammes of fat in
the American patent, while in the foreign patent he says the
fat must be immersed in the gastric juice; but the* proof
shows that the formula for the gastric juice in the American
patent gives a more potent and effective product, and we presume Y6ge may, by his experience and practice under his
patents, have ascertained, at the time he took the American
patent, that the process of digestion could be accomplished
with a less quantity of gastric juice than was described in his
first patents; but this is only a difference in degree, and Ivith
a larger quantity of gastric juice and not so complete comminution, about the same result would probably be obtained
as with complete and thorough crushing of all the fat cells
and a smaller quantity of gastric juice, especially if made
stronger. or more potent; so that the difference in the American
and foreign patents in that regard seems to us wholly immaterial and unsubstantial.
"As to the claim that these witnesses find in the American
patent permission to raise the temperature above 1030 F., we
do not think it is well founded when the whole of AMge's
specifications in his American patent are considered. Under
the third head, 'Concentrated digestion,' Mdge says, IWhen
the fat 'has descended in the vessel he melted it by means of
artificial digestion, so that the heat does not exceed 1030 F,?
Further on, in the same paragraph, he says, 'He slowly
raised the temperature to about 1.03 ° F., so that the mattershall completely separate.' Taking these two expressions
together, it seems to us the first limits the second, and that
the directions of the patent are specific not to raise the temperature above 1030 F. Certainly the language, 'I slowly
raise the temperature to about 103*,' does not authorize raisVoL. cxCXv-13

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

ing the temperature above that point. When the distinction
immediately before is that it must not exceed 1030 F.; and
when we consider this language- of the specifications in the
light of the testimony in the case, which shows that gastric
juice is destroyed whenever its temperature is raised much
above 103' F., we think there can be no doubt that the eminent scientist who devised this process intended to keep
within the limits in which his gastric juice would be operative
for the purposes of digestion.
"The last and final distinction, that the foreign patents
contemplated a cooling of the mass below 86', or until it had
become stiff so that it could be handled and cut, before the
pressure was applied for the purpose of separating the oleomargarine from the stearine, is a distinction, as it seems to us,
without a difference. If the stearine had become crystallized
in the mass, although it might at one time have been cooled
below 86', when it was sliced and placed between the warm
plates in the press, the oleomargarine would again become
liquid, and flow out under the action of the warm plates and
the press, so as to secure the separation; and that such was
the result is sufficiently established by the statements in the
foreign patents, notably the Austrian and English, that about
sixty per cent of a mixture of the margarine and oleine, of a
composition identical with lard, but of superior flavor, was
obtained by the pressure, and would seem to show, in the
light of the proof in this case, that he obtained as large a produnt as is obtained by the process of the American patent.
".A fair test of the question as to whether the American
patent is anticipated by the foreign patents, or is included in
them, we think would be: Were a person in this country,
after the issue of the present American patent, to commence
the maiufacture of oleomargarine by the precise process described in the Bavarian or Austrian patents, supposing that process had not been patented abroad, would the courts refuse an
injunction to restrain the use of the process on the ground
that it infringed that covered by the American patent? We
call hardly deem it possible that any intelligent court would
deny an injunction if applied for under such circumstances,

and we think this fairly illustrates the relation of the foreign
to the American patent."
The conclusion of the Circuit Court was that the plaintiffs'
patent expired by the expiration of the Bavarian and Austrian
patents.
We have carefully considered the arguments urged in the
briefs of the counsel for the plaintiffs, in connection with the
testimony of their experts, and are of opinion that the views
of the Circuit Court, above quoted, are correct. Its decree is

WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 276. Submitted April 11, 1890.-Decided April 21,1890.

A suit was brought to recover from T. possession of atract of land of
about 35 acres, part of a larger tract of 186 acres, which the plaintiff.
claimed to own. The lessor of T. of the 35 acres was made defendant,
and answered, claiming to own the land sued for and also the rest of the
186 acres. The plaintiff recovered a judgment for the 35 acres, their,
value not exceeding $2000. The value of the 186 acres was about
$10,000. The lessor having brought the case to this dourt by a writ of
error, it was dismissed, on the ground that the amount involved was
not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction, because it did not exceed
#5000, exclusive of costs.
