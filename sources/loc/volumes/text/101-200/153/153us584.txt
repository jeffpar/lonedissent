Statement of the Case.

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR T1E1

EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 922. Argued April 17, 18,1894.- Decided May 14,1894.
An indictment should charge the crime, alleged to have been committed,
with precision and certainty, and every ingredient of which it is composed
must be accurately and clearly alleged; but it is not necessary in framing it to set up an impracticable standard of particularity, whereby the
government may be entrapped into making allegations which it would,
be impossible to prove.
Applying this rule, the eighth count in the indictment, charging the prisoner
with unlawfully procuring the surrender and delivery to himself of the
funds of a national bank of which he was a director, and the fourteenth
count, charging him with knowingly and fraudulently aiding in procuring the discount of unsecured paper by the bank, are examined in detail, and are held to be sufficient to sustain the conviction.
A verdict of guilty, entered upon all the counts of an indictment, should
stand if any one of them is good.
PLAINTIFF in error, who was a director in the Spring Garden National Bank, was indicted for an alleged violation of
Revised Statutes, ยง 5209, which reads as follows: "Every
president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent of any
association, who embezzles, abstracts, or wilfully misapplies
any of the moneys, funds, or credits of the association;
with intent, in either case, to injure or defraud the association or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any
individual person, . . . and every person who with like
intent aids or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any violation of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more
than ten."
The indictment contained 146 counts, upon all of which,
except 24, a nolle pros. was entered. A demurrer was filed
to all these remaining counts, which was overruled. The
defendant was then arraigned, pleaded not guilty, was put
upon trial, and convicted upon all the 24 counts, and sentenced

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

to five years' imprisonment. A motion for a new trial and
in arrest of judgment being overruled, defendant sued out
this writ, assigning as error the action of the court in overruling his demurrer, and in refusing to arrest the judgment
on account of the insufficiency of the indictment. The case
was originally argued in this court upon the sufficiency of all
these counts, and a reargument subsequently ordered upon
the eighth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth.
A copy of the eighth count, which was a representative one
of its class, and in its framework and structure was similar
to all the counts to which the attention of the court was
called, is here given:
"8. And the grand inquest aforesaid, inquiring as aforesaid,
upon their respective oaths and affirmations aforesaid, do
further present that heretofore, to wit, on the eighth day of
May, A.D. 1891, the said Nelson F. Evans,' yeoman, late of
the district aforesaid, at the district aforesaid and within the

and fraudulently aid and abet one Harry H. Kennedy, (the
said Harry H. Kennedy being then and there cashier of a

opinion of the court.

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

This case involves the sufficiency of an indictment for the
wilful misapplication of the funds of a national bank, in violation of section 5209 of the Revised Statutes.
A rule of criminal pleading, which at one time obtained in
some of the circuits, and perhaps received a qualified sanction
from this court in United States v. Mills, 7 Pet. 138, that an
indictment for a statutory misdemeanor is sufficient, if the
offence be charged in the words of the statute, must, under
more recent decisions, be limited to cases where the words of
the statute themselves, as was said by this court in United
States v. Carll, 105 U. S. 611, 612, "fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all
the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be
punished." The crime must be charged with precision and
certainty, and every ingredient of which it is composed must
be accurately and clearly alleged. United States v. cook,
17 Wall. 168, 174; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542.
558. "The fact that the statute in question, read in the light
of the common law, and of other statutes on the like matter,
enables the court to infer the intent of the legislature, does not
dispense with the necessity of alleging in thd indictment all
the facts necessary to bring the case within that intent."
United States v. Cat, 105 U. S. 611.
Even in the cases of misdemeanors, the indictment must be
free from all ambiguity, and leave no doubt in the minds of
the accused and the court of the exact offence intended to be
charged, not only that the former may know what he is called
upon to meet, but that, upon a plea of former acquittal or conviction, the record may show with accuracy the exact offence
to which the plea relates. United States v. Simmons, 96 U. S.
360; United States v. Hess, 124 U. S.483; Pettibone v. United
States, 148 U. S.197; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104.
The section in question in this case was before this court in
United States v. Britton, 107 U. S.655, 669, in which the wilful misapplication made an offence by this statute was defined
to be "a misapplication for the use, benefit, or gain of the
party charged or of some company or person other than the
association," and that to constitute such an offence there must

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

be a conversion to the use of the offender, or of some one else,
of the moneys or funds of the association by the party charged.
It was said that a count which merely charged a maladministration of the affairs of the bank rather than a criminal misapplication of its funds was insufficient. "It would not," said Mr.
Justice Woods, "be sufficient simply to aver that the defendant
' wilfully misapplied' the funds of the association. .
. There
must be averments to show how the application was made, and
that it was an unlawful one." The case again came before
this court in 108 U. S. 199, and it was then held that the declaring of a dividend by the association when there were no
net profits to pay it was not a criminal application of its funds,
but an act of maladministration which, while it might subject
the association to a forfeiture of its charter, and the directors
to a personal liability for damages, did not render them liable
to a criminal prosecution. Again, in United States v. 2irorthway,
120 U. S. 327, it was held not to be necessary to charge that
the moneys and funds alleged to have been misapplied had
been previously entrusted to the defendant, since a wilful and
criminal misapplication of such funds might be made by its
officer or agent without having previously received them into
his manual possession. See also 0laassen v. United States, 142
U. S. 140.
The counts of this indictment may be divided into three
general classes: First, those charging the defendant with procuring the surrender and delivery to himself of the funds of
the bank, and which for convenience may be termed the
"surrender and delivery" counts; second, those based upon
the illegal discount of unsecured paper, and which may be
termed the "unlawful discount" counts; and, third, those in
which the defendant is accused of fraudulently overdrawing
his own account at the bank, and which may be termed the
"overdraft" counts.
1. The eighth, one of the "surrender and delivery" counts,
charges in substance that on May 8, 1891, Evans did knowingly, wilfully, unlawfully, and fraudulently aid and abet one
Harry H. Kennedy, cashier of the bank, to wilfully misapply
certain moneys, funds, and credits belonging to the bank, for

EVANS v. UNITED 'STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the use, benefit, and advantage of the said Evans, with intent
in him, the said Evans, to injure and defraud the bank: That
is to say, that the said cashier did knowingly, unlawfully,
fraudulently, and wilfully, and with intent to injure and defraud the bank, misapply the sum of $7500, to wit, a promissory note dated November 10, 1890, made and drawn by
A. B. Nettleton for this amount, due March 13, 1891, which
had been theretofore discounted by the bank, was then overdue and unpaid, and was held by the bank as and for funds
and credits, as aforesaid: Whereupon, the said cashier, with
intent to injure and defraud the bank, did wilfully, knowingly, and fraudulently misapply the same by surrendering
and delivering the note to Evans, without receiving payment
therefor for the bank, and the said Evans did there knowingly
and unlawfully aid and abet the said cashier in such wilful
misapplication with intent in him, said Evans, to injure and
defraud the bank.
The ninth and tenth counts did not differ from the eighth,
except in describing other notes made by Nettleton, of different dates and amounts.
The same objection was taken to all of them, viz., that there
was no averment that the defendant did not receive such
notes as an agent for collection, or to secure their renewal,
and subsequently failed to account for the same to the bank
for proceeds or renewals; and, further, that there was no
averment that the bank did not, either at the time of the
surrender, or at any subsequent time, receive security, value,
or renewal notes therefor, and no averment that the bank
had been in any manner a loser thereby.
In answer to the first objection, that there was no averment
that the defendant did not receive the notes as an agent for
collection or to secure their renewal, it is sufficient to say that
the count charges defendant with wilfully misappropriating
the money and oredits of the bank for his own use, benefit,
and advantage, and with intent to defraud the bank, and that
the object of the subsequent language of the count is rather
to identify the property misapplied than to charge a distinct
offence, although the allegation of a wilful misappropriation,

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

with intent to defraud, is repeated. The count charges, as
ingredients of the crime, first, that the defendant knowingly,
wilfully, unlawfully, and fraudulently aided and abetted the
cashier; second, in wilfully misappropriating the funds and
credits of the bank; third, that he did this for his own use
and benefit; fourth, with intent to defraud the bank; fifth,
the credit misapplied is then described as a note of one Nettleton, which was then overdue and unpaid; sixth, the manner
of the misapplication is then set forth as consisting in the
surrender and delivery of the same to the defendant, without
receiving any part of the sum represented by the note.
Every element of the offence being set forth in the earlier
part of the count, there was no necessity of repeating it when
the particular credit misapplied is described, nor of negativing
every possible theory consistent with an innocent delivery of
the note to the defendant. This requirement would have the
effect of limiting the government to allegations it might be
wholly unable to prove, and without subserving any useful
purpose to the defendant. While the rules of criminal pleading require that the accused shall be fully apprised of the
charge made against him, it should, after all, be borne in mind
that the object of criminal proceedings is to convict the guilty,
as well as to shield the innocent, and no impracticable standards
of particularity should be set up, whereby the government
may be entrapped into making allegations which it would be
impossible to prove. The note might have been delivered to
the defendant for a score of honest purposes, which it would
be utterly impossible to anticipate. Neither in criminal nor
in civil pleading is it required to anticipate or negative a
defence. "Where there is no question of variance .
the indictment need not, by way of negative, introduce matter
of defence when it is drawn on a statute any more than when
it is at common law." 1 Bish. Crim. Pro. ยง 638. "In general," says Chitty, "all matters of defence faust come from
the defendant, and need not be anticipated or stated by prosecutor." 1 Ohitty Grim. Law, 231; see also United States v.
Cook, 17 Wall. 173. The general words of a fraudulent misapplication to the use and benefit of the defendant, and of an

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

intent by so doing to defraud the bank, are of themselves inconsistent with an honest purpose. Indeed, the word "surrender" carries with it something more than a bare delivery,
and indicates a transfer of title as well as of possession.
It was equally unnecessary to charge that the bank did not,
either at the time of surrendering, or at any subsequent time,
receive security, value, or renewals for the notes surrendered,
or that it had been the loser by such surrender, sinc6 there
was an allegation that the surrender was made without receiving therefor, for the bank, the sum represented by the notes,
or any part thereof. If it did receive such value thereafter it
was clearly a matter of defence. The misdemeanor was complete when the note was fraudulently misapplied to the use of
the defendant, with intent to defraud the bank, and, if the
bank subsequently saved itself from loss, it was a matter to be
proven by the accused, if, indeed, it were any defence at all.
If, at the time of the surrender, the bank received security,
value, or renewals, as a part of the same transaction, this
would undoubtedly be a defence; but if the accused subsequently repented and indemnified the bank, or the latter was
able to protect itself from loss, it is very doubtful whether
this would inure to the benefit of the defendant, or purge him
of the charge. 2 Bish. Grim. Law, ยง 796; Regina v. Phetheon,
9 0. & P. 552 ; Regina v. Peters,1 0. & K. 245 ; State v. Scott,
64 N. 0. 586; Wharton's Am. Grim. Law, ยง 1797.
2. The fourteenth count, which may be treated as a representative of all the "unlawful discount" counts, charged in
substance that Evans knowingly, wilfully, unlawfully, and
fraudulently aided and abetted the cashier to wilfully misapply
the money, funds, and credits of the bank, for the use, benefit,
and advantage of the defendant, with the intent on defendant's
part to injure and defraud the bank, in that the said cashier
knowingly, unlawfully, fraudulently, and wilfully, with the
intent to defraud the bank, and for the use, etc., of the said
Evans, misapplied the sum of $15,000 by receiving and discounting, with the money and funds of the bank, a note made
by Evans for this amount, (giving copy,) which note, when so
discounted, "was not then and there well secured," as the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

cashier and Evans both well knew, and which note was never
paid, by reason of which the bank suffered loss in this amount,
with intent, in the said Evans, to injure and defraud the bank.
While the mere discount of an unsecured note, even if the
maker and the officer making the discount knew it was not
secured, would not necessarily be a crime, if the maker believed
that he would be able to provide for it at maturity; yet if his
original intent was to procure the note to be discounted in
order to defraud the bank, as charged in this count, every
element of criminality is present. The case is not unlike that
of purchasing goods or obtaining credit. If a person buy
goods on credit in good faith, knowing that he isunable to pay
for them at the time, but believing that he will be able to pay
for them at the maturity of the bill, he is guilty of no offence
even if he be disappointed in making such payment. But if
he purchases them, knowing that he will not be able to pay
for them, and with an intent to cheat the vendor, this is a
plain fraud, and made punishable as such by statutes in many
of the States. In this particular of an intent to defraud, the
case is distinguishable from that of United States v. Britton,
108 U. S. 193, in which the charge was that the defendant,
being president and director of the association, and, being
insolvent, procured his own note to be discounted, the same
not being well secured, the payee and the endorser thereof
being also insolvent, which he, defendant, well knew. The
incriminating facts were that the note was not well secured,
and that both the maker and endorser were, to the knowledge
of the defendant, insolvent when the note was discounted. The
question there presented was whether the procuring of the
discount of such a note by an officer of the association was a
wilful misapplication of its moneys within the meaning of the
law. It was held that it was not. The criminality really
depends upon the question whether there was, at the time of
the discount, a deliberate purpose on the part of the defendant
to defraud the bank of the amount.
It is objected, however, to this count that there was no averment that the cashier, in discounting the note, acted in excess
of his powers or outside of his regular duties, nor was there

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

any averment that the cashier was not the duly authorized
officer of the bank to discount paper, nor was there any averment that the discount was procured by any fraudulent means,
or that Evans was at the time of such discount insolvent, or
knew himself to be so. It was held by this court in Bank of
the Unitea States v. Dunn, 6 Pet. 51, that the power to discount
paper was not one of the implied powers of the cashier, and
this is believed to be the law at the present day. Morse on
Banking, ยง 117. If the directors of this bank had authorized
their cashier, either generally or in this particular case, to discount paper, it was clearly matter of defence. But even if he
did possess such power, and wilfully abused it by discounting
notes which he knew to be worthless, and did this with deliberate intent to defraud the bank, it is not perceived that his
criminality is any less than it would have been if he had acted
beyond the scope of his authority.
No averment was necessary that such discount was procured by fraudulent means, since the offence consists not in
the use of fraudulent means, but in the discount of a note
which both parties knew to be unsecured, with the intent
thereby to defraud the bank. An averment that Evans was
at the time insolvenlt, or knew himself to be so, was also unnecessary, in view of the allegation that Evans knew that the
note was not secured, and procured the same to be discounted
with intent to defraud the bank. The argument of the defendant in this connection assumes that under no circumstances is the discount of a note, which all parties know to
be worthless, an offence under the statute, even though such
discount be made for the deliberate purpose of defrauding the
bank out of the proceeds of the note so discounted. We do
not see how it is possible to give such an interpretation to the
statute without a practical nullification of its provisions.
Defendant's entire criticism upon these counts seems to be
founded upon the hypothesis that no weight whatever is to
be given the words "knowingly, wilfully, unlawfully, and
fraudulently," or to the general allegation of an intent to
defraud -in
short, that these words are mere surplusage.
Where, however, the statute uses words which are not absoVOL. CLHI-38

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

lutely inconsistent with, an honest purpose, such as was held
by this court in Britton's case were the words "wilfully misapplied," the allegation of an intent to defraud becomes
material in the highest degree. In fact, the gravamen of
the offence consists in the evil design with which the misapplication is made, and a count which should omit the words
" wilfully," etc., and "1with intent to defraud," would be
clearly bad. While it is entirely true that an allegation of
fraud is insufficient, either in an indictment or in a bill
in equity, without giving the particulars of the fraud, an intent to defraud is only to be gathered by the jury from all
the facts and circumstances of the case. There is no greater
need of setting out the evidence to prove such intent than
there would be of averring in detail the evidence of a scienfe',,
or of any other fact material to the offence. Where the intent is a material ingredient of the crime it is necessary to
be averred; but it may always be averred in general terms,
as in a case of assault with intent to kill. So in an indictment for murder, it is necessary to aver that the killing was
done "wilfully, feloniously, and of malice aforethought;"
but the evidence that it was so done, though necessary to be
given, is not necessary to be set forth. This subject, however, was so fully considered by this court in l'nitedStates v.
Simmons, 96 U. S. 360, 364, that it is needless to dwell upon
it more at length here. In that case the indictment averred
that the defendant "did knowingly and unlawfully engage
in and carry on the business of a distiller

.

.

with intent

to defraud the United States of the tax on the spirits distilled
by him." It was held not to be necessary to state the particular means by which the United States was to be defrauded
of the tax. "The defendant," said the court, "is entitled to
a formal and substantial statement of the grounds upon
which he is questioned, but not to such strictness in averment
as might defeat the ends of justice. The intent to defraud
the United States is of the very essence of the offence; and
its existence in connection with the business of distilling being
distinctly charged, must be established by satisfactory evidence. Such intent may, however, be manifested by so many

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.

acts upon the part of the accused, covering such a long period
of time, as to render it difficult, if not wholly impracticable,
to aver, with any degree of certainty, all the essential facts
from which it may be fairly inferred." "The means of effecting the criminal intent," says Mr. Wharton, "or the circumstances evincive of the design with which the act was done,
are considered to be matters of evidence to go to the jury to
demonstrate the intent, and not necessary to be incorporated
in an indictment." 1 Wharton's Criminal Law, ยง 292.
A general verdict of guilty was rendered upon all the
counts of this indictment upon which a nolle prosequi was
not entered, and as such verdict should stand if any,one of
the counts is good, it will not be necessary to consider them
in any further detail. Claassen v. United States, 142 U. S. 140.
The judgment of the court below is, therefore,

Affirmed.
MR. JusTicE FIELD dissenting.
I am unable to concur in the judgment of the court in these
cases, or in the opinion upon which it is founded. The two
cases arise out of the same state of facts, are similar in essential particulars, and were argued together.
The defendant below, Nelson F. Evans, the plaintiff in
error here, was for some years previously to May, 1891, a
director of the Spring Garden National, Bank, a national
banking association doing business by that name at Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania. The bank failed on the
9th of May, 1891, and passed into the hands of a receiver.
A year afterwards, in May, 1892, the defendant Evans was
indicted for various acts in alleged violation of section 5209
of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which is as
follows :
" SEc. 5209. Every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk,
or agent of any association who embezzles, abstracts, or wilfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds., or credits of the
association; or who, without authority from the directors,
issues or puts in circulation any of the notes of the association; or who, without such authority, issues or put forth any

certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange,
makes any acceptance, assigns any note, bond, draft, bill of
exchange, mortgage, judgment or decree; or who makes any
false entry in any book, report, or statement of the association with intent, in either case, to injure or defraud the association, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or
any individual person, or to deceive any officer of the association, or any agent appointed to examine the affairs of any
such association; and every person who with like intent aids
or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any violation of this
section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be
imprisoned not less than five years, nor more than ten."
The indictments originally contained several hundred counts,
charging over one hundred and fifty different offences, but as
to a large number of the counts a nolle prosequi was entered.
The number retained was still large, amounting to twentythree in one indictment and fifty-seven in the other. To them
demurrers were filed and overruled. The defendant was then
arraigned and pleaded not guilty, and, upon the issues, a jury
was called and trials had, which resulted in conviction in both
cases. A motion for a new trial in each case was overruled.
Subsequently a motion in arrest of judgment, upon substantially the same grounds as those urged in support of the
demurrers prior to the pleas, was made. This motion was
also overruled, and the defendant was then sentenced, upon
the conviction, under one of the indictments, to imprisonment
in the penitentiary for the term of five years, and upon the
conviction under the other indictment to a like imprisonment
for the term of two years following the expiration of the previous imprisonment. The cases are brought to this court
upon writs of error to review these judgments.
The counsel of the defendant has given the court much
assistance in the consideration of the cases by the careful
analysis he has made of the different counts. These are so
numerous, presenting in many of them the same charge with
confusing variations, as to obscure rather than to render clear
the real offences intended.
In the indictment in case No. 923, the offence charged

EVAdNS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

against the defendant in the first four cbunts is set forth in
the most general way. In the first of these four the defendant is charged as a director with wilfully misapplying the
funds aid credits of the bank. In the second he is charged
with conspiring with officers of the bank to wilfully misapply
its money and credits. In the third he is charged with aiding
and abetting the president of the bank to misapply it9 moneys,
funds, and credits. In the fourth count he is charged with
aiding and abetting the cashier of the bank in a similar misapplication. A demurrer was interposed to each of these four
general counts on the ground that it did n6t specify the means
whereby the alleged misapplication was made, and show that
they were unlawful.
The remaining counts of the indictment are more specific,
some of them charging the defendant as a director with misapplying moneys, funds, and credits by depositing checks and
obtaining fictitious credits thereon; others charging him with
aiding and abetting the president in misapplying funds and
credits in the same manner; others with aiding and abetting
the cashier in a like misapplication of the funds; others with
aiding and abetting the president in misapplying funds by
surrendering notes; others with aiding and abetting the
president in misapplying the funds by discounting unsecured
notes of the defendant; others with misapplying the funds
through overdrafts; others with aiding and abetting the
president to misapply the funds through overdrafts.
In the indictment in case No. 922 the defendant, in some of
the counts, is charged with aiding and abetting the cashier in
misapplying the funds of the bank by surrendering 'to the
defendant unpaid notes, which the bank had discounted and
still held, without receiving for them the amount thereof, or
any part of it; in some also with aiding and abetting the
cashier to misapply the funds by discounting unsecured notes;
in some also with aiding and abetting the cashier to misapply
the funds through overdrafts.
For the disposition of these cases it is not necessary to pass
upon each count separately. In the first instance the general
counts will be considered, and then an examination made as

to the sufficiency of the specific counts upon which the
government chiefly relies to sustain the prosecution. If they
will not bear the scrutiny given to them, none will. The
grounds of the demurrer to them will be designated when the
counts are separately considered.
With reference to indictments for statutory offences, there
are certain rules which govern their construction. It is usually
sufficient, in such cases, to set forth the offence in the language
of the statute, if it be accompanied by a statement of such
facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the
specific offence, coming under the general description of the
statute, with which he is charged. He must be apprised by
the indictment, with reasonable certainty, of the nature of the
accusation against him, in order that he may be able to prepare for his defence, and, also, in case of conviction or acquittal, that he may plead the judgment in bar of further
proceedings. United States v. Simmons, 96 U. S. 360;
United States v. .ess, 12-4 U. S. 483.
A mere statement of the offence in the words of the statute,
without a statement of the accompanying facts and circumstances essential to constitute a specific offence, will be insufficient. As said by this court in United States v. Carll, 105
U. S. 611, 612, speaking through Mr. Justice Gray, "In an
indictment upon a statute, it is not sufficient to set forth the
offence in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty
or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute
the offence intended to be punished; and the fact that the
statute in question, read in the light of the common law, and
of other statutes on the like matter, enables the court to infer
the intent of the legislature, does not dispense with the necessity of alleging in the indictment all the facts necessary to
bring the case within that intent." Numerous authorities were
cited in support of the views expressed.
There is a very general test applicable to all indictments.
If the facts alleged be established or admitted to be true, and
their truth is consistent with the defendant's innocence, the
indictment is insufficient, however full the description in other

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

respects. Applying this well-settled doctrine to the different
counts of the indictments in these cases, there will be little
difficulty in determining as to their sufficiency. Yet the doctrine appears to be entirely ignored by the majority of the
court, or at least set aside in these cases.
The four general counts are manifestly insufficient, as they
wholly fail to aver the means by which the alleged misapplication of the funds was made by the defendant, or attempted
by him, in conspiracy with the president or cashier, or in aiding
and abetting them.
Upon an allegation that one has misapplied the funds of a
bank, the natural inquiry would be, how-in what manner?
Until the manner in which the application was made and the
purpose of it are shown, no misapplication can be established.
There is no averment of facts in either of the counts of the
indictment to show that the application of the funds was an
unlawful one, and unless it appear from the facts alleged that
such was the case, the application will not constitute the offence charged. Nor is there any averment of facts to show
that the bank suffered any loss or damage by the misapplication. From all that is alleged it may have been the exercise
of an unwise judgment, for which the defendant could not be
charged under the statute, and injury from which may have
been avoided by a subsequent replacement of the moneys.
In United States v. Britton, 107 U. S. 655, 669, the words
"wilfully misapplied," used in the section upon which the
present indictments were found, were considered, and the
court, speaking by Mr. Justice Wood, said: "The words
' wilfully misapplied' are, so far as we know, new in statutes
creating offences, and they are not used in describing any
offence at common law. They have no settled technical
meaning, like the word 'embezzle,' as used in the statutes, or
the words, 'steal, take, and carry away,' as used at common
law. They do not, therefore, of themselves, fully and clearly
set forth every element of the offence charged. It would not
be sufficient simply to aver that the defendant wilfully ' misapplied ' the funds of the association. This is well settled by the
authorities we have already cited. There must be averment.7

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

to show how the aplication'was made, and that itwas an unlawful one." It follows that the demurrer to each of the four
general counts was well taken and should have been sustained.
The two cases, as stated in the opinion of the court, were
originally argued here upon the sufficiency of all the counts.
A reargument having been ordered, it was confined principally
to the eighth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth counts. And in
the opinion a copy of the eighth count is given at length as a
representative one of its class, and as in framework and structure similar to all the counts to which the attention of the court
was called.
This count stripped of its useless verbiage, and of its adjectives imputing supposed fraudulent motives to the conduct
of the defendant, and of adverbs of objurgation, is substantially this and no more: That the defendant, Evans, did, on
the 8th of May, 1891, in the district named, aid and abet the
cashier of the bank to misapply an unpaid note of one Nettleton for seventy-five hundred (7500) dollars, formerly discounted and still held by the bank, by surrendering and
delivering it to the defendant without receiving its amount
or any part thereof, and that it was done by the defendant
to injure and defraud the bank The allegation of the motive of such surrender and delivery adds nothing to the character of the act unless its 'object is shown by stating the use
to which the note was to be put, as that it was for cancellation or appropriation for the benefit of the defendant or of
some one other than the bank, or to accomplish some object
other than to obtain its payment, renewal, or security. Nor
does the count aver that a valid consideration was not received
for the note, or that the bank lost by the transaction. The
mere charge of an intention to misapply the unpaid note is
not sufficient without some allegation of the manner in which
such misapplication was made. This was held in United
States v. B'ritton, 107 U. S. 655. It was there said that to
constitute the offence of wilful misapplication, there must be
a conversion to the use of the offender or of some one else,
of the moneys and funds of the association by the party
charged. It would not be sufficient, the court added, simply

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

to aver that the defendant wilfully misapplied the funds of
the association. "There must be averments to show how the
misapplication was made and that it was an unlawful one."
It is an old doctrine, not to be forgotten in practice or in
pleading, that an act lawful in itself cannot be made criminal
by imputing wrong motives to the conduct of the party.
Punishment is not in our days inflicted for the motives for
which lawful acts are done. There is no force added to the
allegation of "delivered" by the use of the word "surrendered" in this case, but rather its force is weakened. A surrender is usually made upon some right or claim, or upon
coercion. The latter is not suggested here, and surrender is
consistent with some useful purpose in the enforcement of a
claim or right to the note.
Similar observations may be made of almost every count
in both indictments. There is some fact which might be
stated in connection with their allegations and which would
obviate their criminality, but which is omitted, and the omission, in my judgment, makes the indictments invalid.
I do not claim that it is essential that the pleader should
negative every conceivable lawful delivery, such as would be
unusual though possible under some circumstances, but I do
insist that a lawful delivery should be met by a negative to
the natural and ordinary conduct which would be adopted by
innocent parties in such cases. A note discounted at a bank,
when not paid in whole or in part, is not usually surrendered
to a third party without a valuable consideration, unless it be
for collection or to obtain its renewal or security for it, and
such usual action should be negatived by averment. No
doctrine is more essential for the protection of a party accused
of a criminal offence, and none should be more rigidly enforced than this -that the facts alleged by way of accusation, if admitted to be true, must be inconsistent with the
inference of his innocence of the offence charged arising from
the usual conduct of innocent parties in such cases.
I do not assent to the doctrine that the note might have
been delivered to the defendant for a score of honest purposes
which it would be unnecessary to negative, and that in

OCTOBER TERAI, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

criminal pleading it is not required to anticipate and negative
a natural and obvious answer to the accusation. Such is not
the law as I understand it.
The counts which are more specific in their allegations,
and upon the sufficiency of which the prosecution chiefly
relies, will now be considered. These specific counts are
grouped by the prosecution into four sets. The first set
consists of counts five, ten, and eleven of the indictment in case
923. These counts are, substantially, that the defendant on
the 8th of May, 1891, did knowingly, unlawfully, fraudulently,
and wilfully, and with intent to injure and defraud the bank,
misapply certain of its moneys, funds, and credits for his own
use and benefit, to wit, the sum of fifteen thousand three
hundred and thirty-three and " dollars, in the manner and
by the means following, that is to say, the defendant, being
a director, did deposit and place to his credit in the bank his
check, drawn by himself on the Keystone Bank in favor of
the Spring Garden Bank, the amount being in excess of all the
sums which he was then entitled to draw from the moneys
and funds of the Keystone Bank, and by means of which
check, thus deposited, he obtained a false credit upon the books
of the Spring Garden Bank, and was thereby enabled, and
did thereafter, draw out from that bank the sum mentioned
for his own use, benefit, and advantage, as he then well knew,
contrary to the act of Congress.
The three counts differ from each other in this, that the
tenth count charges the defendant with knowingly and fraudulently aiding and abetting the president of the bank to misapply its moneys, funds, and credits, in the amount mentioned,
by receiving on deposit and crediting to himself the check
mentioned. The eleventh count differs only in alleging that
the defendant aided and abetted the cashier of the bank in
misapplying its moneys and credits in the manner mentioned.
The charge is substantially the same in all three counts-that
a false credit was secured by the defendant with the bank by
depositing a check, drawn by him on the Keystone Bank in
excess of what he knew to be his balance there, and which
check was not paid. These counts are subject to the general

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

objection that, admitting all their statements to be correct,
they are still consistent with the innocence of the defendant.
The counts nowhere allege that the check on the Keystone
Bank was ever presented to that bank for payment. The
defendant may have overdrawn his$account in that bank; the
check may have been in excess of all sums which he was
entitled to draw, and yet it might have been paid upon
presentation. There is not, in the mere fact that one overdraws his account at a bank, necessarily any evidence that
the drawer intended to defraud the bank, or any other bank
with which the check was deposited. It is a matter of every
day practice for depositors in a bank to overdraw their
accounts. Whether checks so overdrawn will be paid may
depend upon other considerations than the amount of deposits
of the drawer in the bank. It would be an extraordinary
position to hold that because a man drew upon a bank for
more than he knew he had on deposit he should be charged
by the holder with the commission of a fraud, before the
latter had presented the check to the bank for payment, and
payment had been refused. Whether or not the Keystone
Bank would have paid it, had it been thus presented, may
have depended upon the confidence which the bank might
have entertained in the drawer's ultimate ability to pay.
Though not entitled, in the words of the indictment, to draw
at the time any sums whatever, yet he may have had such
credit with the bank, from its knowledge of his character and
habits, as to induce it to honor his check. It is within the
experience of every one that checks thus drawn are often
honored, even with a knowledge of the drawer's inadequate
deposit. Other facts beside such knowledge by the drawer
must be shown to justify the imputation of criminal intent to
him. A demurrer was interposed to the counts mentioned,
on the ground that it did not aver that the checks in question
were presented to the Keystone Bank for payment and that
payment was refused, and that the bank thereby became a
loser. In my opinion the counts were, for that reason, insufficient, and the demurrer was well taken and should have
been sustained.

OCTOBER TERMt, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

The second set of counts upon which the prosecution relies
are numbers six, seven, eight, nine, twelve, and thirteen of the
same indictment. These also allege that the defendant, being
a director of the Spring Garden Bank, caused certain checks
drawn by him upon the Keystone Bank and the Fourth Street
National Bank of Philadelphia for sums greater than he was
entitled to draw or obtain from them, to be deposited with the
Spring Garden Bank, and placed to his credit on its books, and
thereby obtained a false credit and received from that bank,
for his own use and benefit, the amount of such checks. But
these counts also show that each of such checks was endorsed
in this way: "For deposit to the credit of Nelson F. Evans.
Received payment through the clearing-house." The purport
of this endorsement is that the checks were passed by the bank
through the clearing-house and paid there, a not unusual way
of collecting checks in our large cities. The same objections
that were made to counts five, ten, and eleven can be made to
these counts; and also the further objection that there is an
inconsistency in the allegation that thereby any false credit
was obtained, the checks having endorsed on their face the
statement that payment was received on them through the
clearing-house.
These checks are set forth in the indictment with this endorsement, and there is no allegation that the endorsement
was false or was made, or permitted to be made, by the defendant, with any intent to defraud the bank. The very face,
therefore, of the checks negatives the charge of crime, and
contradicts the idea of loss to the bank. If in answer to this
view it be said that it is alleged that the checks were not paid,
it must be observed that no averment is made of their presentation for payment or of anything to exclude the idea of
negligence on the part of the bank receiving them, or that the
money was not lost through the failure of the bank upon
which they were drawn. The six counts differ from each
other in this, that in some of them the checks are alleged to
have been drawn on the Keystone Bank and in others on the
Fourth Street National Bank; and in some of the counts the
misapplication is charged directly upon the defendant, and in

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, J. *

others by his aiding and abetting the president or the cashier.
On the several grounds stated a demurrer was interposedto
these counts, and in my judgment it was well taken and should
have been sustained.
The third set of counts upon which the prosecution relies
are number fourteen, in the indictment in case 922, and number twenty, in the indictmentin case 923. These counts charge
the defendant with aiding and abetting the president and
cashier of the bank in fraudulently misapplying its funds for
the use and benefit of the defendant, by receiving and discounting his note for fifteen thousand dollars, payable in three
months, knowing that that note was not secured; and it was
not paid at maturity, or at any other time. But these counts
are defective in not alleging that the discounting of the note
was in excess of the power of the president or cashier or outside of their regular duties, or that the president or cashier
was not the authorized officer of the bank to discount paper.
Nor is it averred that the discount was procured by any fraudulent means, or, even, that the defendant was, at the time,
insolvent or knew himself to be so. On these grounds a
demurrer was interposed, and in my judgment should have
been sustained.
The only remaining counts upon which the prosecution
relies are numbers fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the indictment in case 923, and numbers eight, nine, and ten of the
indictment in case 922. These counts charge in substance
that the defendant aided and abetted the president or the
cashier of the bank to fraudulently misapply a large amount
of its funds by surrendering to him for his use and benefit
certain notes of one Nettleton, discounted by the bank and
held as part of its assets, without receiving for the bank the
amount thereof, or any part thereof, and that such surrender
was fraudulently made to injure the bank. The counts in the
indictment in case 923 charge that the defendant aided and
abetted the president of the bank in the fraudulent misapplication. The counts in the other indictment charge that the
defendant aided and abetted the cashier in such misapplication
of the funds. These counts do not show, in either case, any

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
.

Dissenting Opinion: Field, J.

application of the surrendered notes to the use and beneft of
the defendant as charged, nor do they contain any averment
that the defendant did not receive the notes as agent, for collection, or to obtain their renewal, which would readily suggest themselves as an answer to the alleged unlawful surrender,
or that the bank was in any way a loser thereby. The defect
in these counts is substantially the same pointed out in considering the eighth count of No. 922, a copy of which is set forth
in the opinion of the court.
The allegations of fraudulent conduct and motive in the
transactions, for which the indictments were found, are repeated with wearisome frequency, yet they are of no avail
unless accompanied by a statement of facts from which such
fraud must necessarily be inferred. A party is not to be condemned by the multitude or opprobriousness of the adjectives
applied to his conduct or motives, unsupported by the facts,
or, as said by Lord Chief Justice IHolt, "a fact that appears to
be innocent cannot be made a crime by adverbs of aggravation." Fraud is a conclusion of law from facts respecting the
transactions designated, and if they do not necessarily tend to
such conclusion, the allegation falls to the ground, however
often repeated or with whatever amount of earnest asseveration.
Similar views are announced with great clearness and force
in United States v. Vatkins, decided by the Circuit Court for
this District over sixty years. 3 Cranch C. C. 441. The defendant, who was the Fourth Auditor of the Treasury of the
United States, was indicted for devising and intending fraudulently to obtain for his private use moneys of the United
States, by means of letters to and drafts on the navy agent at
New York and the navy agent at Boston, and certain requisitions on the Treasury of the United States, also sent by him
to them, said letters, drafts, and requisitions being used as
false pretences to enable him to obtain the moneys. There
were three indictments found against him, and objections were
taken to the sufficiency of their allegations of fraud. In considering the objections the court said: "Fraud is an inference
of law from certain facts. A fraud, therefore, is not suffi-

EVANS v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, Jr

ciently set forth in an indictment, unless all the facts are
averred which in law constitute the fraud. Whether an act
be done fraudulently or not is a question of law so far as the
moral character of the act is involved. To aver that the act
is fraudulently done is, therefore, so far as the guilt or the
innocence of the act is concerned, to aver a matter of law, and
not a matter of fact. An averment that the act was done
with intent to commit a fraud is equivalent to an averment
that the act was done fraudulently. No epithets, no averment of fraudulent intent, can supply the place of an averment of the fact or facts from which the legal inference of
fraud is to be drawn. Starkey, in his late treatise on Criminal Pleadings, says: 'Whether particular circumstances constitute an indictable fraud is a question of law; and, therefore,
according to a fundamental rule of description in indictments,
such circumstances must be set out in order to show that the
facts amount to an indictable offence.' And he quotes Archbold on Criminal Pleadings as follows: 'An indictment for
an offence against the statute must with certainty and precision charge the defendant to have committed acts under the
circumstances, and with the intent mentioned in the statute;
and if any one of these ingredients in the offence be omitted,
the defendant may demur, move in arrest of judgment, or
bring a writ of error. The defect will not be aided by verdict, nor will the conclusion, contraformarn.statuti, cure it.'"
The charges in the two indictments, by their very number,
setting forth over seventy-five distinct offences, after dismissing
counts for over one hundred other offences -those retained
varying from each other by confusing differences - were calculated to embarrass and oppress the defendant in his defence.
The allegations of fraud in conduct and motive not being supported by any averment of facts from which such fraud is
necessarily inferable, the other allegations as to the transactions charged are, upon a reasonable construction, consistent
with the innocence of the defendant. And indictments, in my
opinion, ought not to be viewed with favor which, by the very
multitude of their counts, serve to embarrass and confuse the
accused. If an offence cannot be stated in less than one hun-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

dred counts of an indictment, I do not think that public justice
will suffer if the indictment be dismissed.
My conclusion is that the indictments on all the counts retained are insufficient to hold the defendant, and that the judgment below thereon should be reversed in both cases and
judgment entered upon the demurrers in each case for the
defendant, and that he be discharged therefrom.

Tins case was argued with No. 922, ante, 684. It was also
an indictment against Evans for a wilful misapplication of the
funds of the Spring Garden National Bank. The indictment
originally contained 152 counts, upon all of which except 57 a

the former case. The defendant was convicted upon all the
counts, and sentenced to imprisonment for two years at and
from the expiration of such imprisonment as he might undergo
by reason of the sentence in the prior case. He subsequently
sued out this writ of error. A reargument was ordered upon
the fifth to the eleventh counts inclusive, and upon the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and twentieth counts.
