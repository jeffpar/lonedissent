Statement of the Case.

flicting with any provision of the Federal Constitution, it may
in like manner provide that taxes which have become delinquent shall bear interest from the time the delinquency commenced. This is adding no novel or extraordinary penalty, for
interest is the ordinary incident to the non-payment of obligations.
We see nothing else in the record calling for notice, and, findis
ing no error, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas

.HATFIELD v. KING.'
Statement of the Case.

Virginia to quiet his title to certain lands. In the bill he alleged that he was the owner in fee and in the actual possession
of a large tract, known as the "Robert Morris 500,000 Acre
Grant," which was granted by Virginia in 1795 to Robert
Morris, of Philadelphia, and is situated partly in West Virginia,
and partly in Kentucky and Virginia. He followed this general
allegation with a detailed statement of his chain of title and of
certain tax proceedings. After these averments, tending to
show his own rights and title, he charged that Aly and Joseph
Hatfield, father and son, had at different times obtained pretended titles to certain small tracts within the limits of his
grant, stating how these titles were obtained and wherein he
claimed they were invalid. He further averred that both the
Hatfields were dead; that their only heirs were the two defendants, now appellants, the widow and daughter of Joseph
Hatfield, who wrongfully claimed the tracts last mentioned
and thereby cast a cloud upon the plaintiff's title. No process
was issued, but on June 8, 1899, a demurrer was filed on behalf
of the defendants, signed by one appearing as their attorney.
This demurrer was overruled on May 16, 1900, and leave given
to file answer. Thereupon, as the record states, the defendants
declined to answer but elected to stand upon their demurrer,
and on June 2, 1900, a decree was entered in favor of plaintiff,
quieting his title to the lands claimed by the defendants. From
this decree an appeal was prayed and allowed to this court, and
the appeal papers were filed here on January 3, 1901.
The bill was so framed as to invite a consideration, in some
aspects, of the question of forfeiture for non-payment of taxes,
presented to this court in King v. ffullins, 171 U. S. 401.
At the beginning of this term one of the appellants, Nancy
C. Browning, (erroneously, as she states, called Nancy C.Rutherford in the record,) moved for a rule against the attorney who
had appeared for her, to show by what authority he had assumed to so appear and why he should not be attached and
his name stricken from the roll of attorneys for falsely assuming to act as her attorney and imposing upoft the circuit and
this court a false, fictitious and manufactured case.for the purpose of obtaining an opinion and judgment on a false statement

of facts, to her injury and the injury of others similarly situated
but not parties to the suit or appeal. She also asked that the alleged final decree of the Circuit Court be declared null and void,
and that this appeal and the cause be dismissed. At the same
time other parties, claiming to be interested in the Robert Morris
tract, appeared and represented that the entire proceedings had
in this case were feigned and fictitious; that the litigation on
both sides was controlled by the counsel for the plaintiff King,
and asked an examination as to the truth of the charge so made.
A substantially similar motion was made on behalf of the State
of West Virginia. The counsel named in the record have answered, denying these charges and asserting the fullest integrity
in the matter. Quite a number of affidavits have been filed
and also some documentary evidence presented.

MR. JusTicE, BREWER, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
It is contended by the appellants that the decree in the Circuit Court against them ought to be set aside because they have
not had the hearing in that court to which they were entitled
by law; that they were not served with process; that counsel
unauthorized by them entered their appearance, and after having wrongfully entered their appearance failed to take the
proper steps for the protection of their rights.
It is also contended (though by other parties than the appellants) that there was no real controversy between the parties

HAXTIELD v. KING.
Opinion of the Court.

nominally opposed to each other, and that the litigation was in
fact carried on under the direction and control of the plaintiff.
It is well settled that questions of this kind may be examined,
upon motion, supported by affidavits, and that it is the duty of
a court to make such inquiry, in order that it may not be imposed on by an apparent controversy to which there are really
no adverse parties. Shelton v. Tiffin, 6 How. 163, 186; Lord
v. eazie, 8 How. 251 ; Cleveland v. Chamberlain,1 Black, 419,
426; Wood Paper Company v. Heft, 8 Wall. 333; Tennessee
&c. Rd. Co. v. Southern Tel. Co., 125 U. S. 695; South Spi-ng
Gold Co. v. Amador Gold Co., 145 U. S. 300; California v.
San Pablo &o. Railroad,149 U. S. 308.
In Cleveland v. Chamberlain,it was said, quoting from Lord
v. Veazie: "Any attempt, by a mere colorable dispute, to obtain the opinion of the court upon a question of law, which a
party desires to know for his own interest or his own purposes,
when there is no real and substantial controversy between those
who appear as adverse parties to the suit, is an abuse which
courts of justice have always reprehended and treated as a punishable contempt of court."
In Shelton v. Tiffin, the question was as to the validity of a
judicial sale, and it appeared that one of the defendants in the
proceedings had not been served with process; that an attorney
had entered an appearance for him but had done so inadvertently and without authority, and it was said: "_An appearance
by counsel under such circumstances, to the prejudice of a party,
subjects the counsel to damages; but this would not sufficiently
protect the rights of the defendant. He is not bound by the
proceedings, and there is no other principle which can afford him
adequate protection. The judgment, therefore, against L. P.
Perry must be considered a nullity, and consequently did not
authorize the seizure and sale of his property."
If it be true, as claimed by some of the moving parties, that
this is a collusive suit, that there is no real controversy between
the plaintiff and defendants, that the plaintiff has been controlling the litigation on both sides with a view of obtaining an
opinion on a matter of law in which he is interested, the transaction is one which, as stated, courts of justice have always

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

reprehended, and should be treated as a punishable contempt,
and no decree entered under those circumstances should be permitted to stand.
So far as respects permitting the decree to stand, the same
result would follow even though there were no collusion, if
the appearance of counsel was, in fact, not authorized or ratified
by the defendants; and to that matter alone shall we direct
our attention.
Before any proceedings could rightfully be taken against the
defendants it was essential that either they be brought into court
by service of process or that a lawful appearance be made in
their behalf. Confessedly they were not served with process,
and they now deny the right of counsel to have entered an appearance for them. The evidence upon this, as well as kindred
questions, is principally in ex parte affidavits. The appellants
were respectively the widow and daughter of Joseph Hatfield,
and claimed title to the various tracts by inheritance from him.
It appears that in 1895 an action of ejectment was brought by
King against several parties, these appellants among the number.
Mrs. Hatfield was led to employ in that case the same counsel
who entered her appearance in this. We do not stop to inquire
into the circumstances which it is alleged attended that employment. She swears that it was simply for that action and a suit
ancillary thereto brought to enjoin the cutting of timber; that
she never employed him in any other matter, and knew nothing
of the pendency of this suit until after the decree against her
and the appeal to this court. She also swears that she never
attempted to act for her daughter in preparing for the defence
of any suit or action, or in making any arrangements for her.
Mrs. Browning testifies thdt at the time of the ejectment suit
she was the widow of John Rutherford; that on December 25,
1895, she married her present husband, Albert Browning; that
she had no notice or knowledge of the present suit, and never
directly or indirectly -employed or authorized any one to appear
for her therein, or in any other controversy or matter pertaining to said lands; and further, never authorized any person to
employ said counsel or any other attorney to appear and represent her in this suit.

HATFIELD v. KING.
Opinion of the Court.

On the other hand, the counsel's affidavit is that he was employed by Mrs. Hatfield in the prior action, and supposed he
was authorized by the scope of that employment to appear for
her in this suit; that he had the title papers of both the appellants in his possession and had no suggestion of any revocation
of his authority. He introduced a copy of a letter from Mrs.
Hatfield, which supported his claim of employment, at least in
the ejectment case. While he testifies to having met and conversed with Mrs. Hatfield, he does not state that he ever met
'Mrs. Browning or had any conversation or correspondence with.
her, although he does state in a general way that she sanctioned
and ratified the action of her mother in employing him.
We do not deem it necessary to mention all the matters of
evidence, but it seems to us quite clear that, whatever may
have been his understanding of the matter, the counsel was not
authorized to appear for Mrs. Browning. She had in fact
never employed him in any litigation in respect to these lands
or otherwise, nor had she authorized any one to employ him,
and she had no notice of the pendency of this suit. As to Mrs.
Hatfield, while she did at one time employ him in other litigation, she knew nothing of the pendency of this suit until after
the decree and the appeal, and if the employment in the ejectment action was sufficiently broad to cover all future litigation
of any kind in respect to the land, it would seem to have been
so only in consequence of a contract which she says was made,
and which, if made, would stamp the whole transaction with
wrong.
We do not stop to inquire whether the course pursued by
counsel was under the circumstances the best that could have
been taken for the protection of the appellants' rights. They
were entitled to notice of the pendency of the suit, to select
such counsel as they chose and to be guided by his advice and
judgment, even though that advice and judgment should prove
to be erroneous.
We have refrained from spreading upon our records a detailed statement of the. charges and countercharges made in
the various motions and affidavits that hate been filed, and
have only referred to so much as seemed necessary for the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

present disposition of the case. But our reticence in this respect must not be taken as expressive of a purpose to ignore
them. The charges are serious ones, affecting the integrity of
counsel, commended, by the fact of admission to the bar of the
Circuit Court, to the confidence of the community. They involve the due administration of justice in that court and cannot
be passed without notice and action. It is not enough that the
doors of the temple of justice are open; it is essential that the
ways of approach be kept clean. We refrain from extended
comment because, as heretofore stated, the testimony is mainly
by exparte affidavits, which are often, this case being no exception, quite unsatisfactory, and it is only through the sifting
process of cross-examination that the real facts can be disclosed.
When the truth is ascertained, if there be wrongs as charged,
the language of judicial condemnation should be clear and emphatic, and a punishment inflicted such as the wrongs deserve;
and if no wrong has been done the conduct of counsel will be
cleared from suspicion. It is fitting that this investigation
should be had in the first place in the court where the wrong
is charged to have been done and before the judge who, if the
charges are correct, has been imposed upon by counsel, and it
may be wise that both examination and cross-examination be
had in his presence.
The order, therefore, is that this case be remanded to the
Circuit Court, with instructions to set aside the decree as well
as the appearance of defendants, and to proceed thereafter in
accordance with law; and also to make a full investigation, in
such manner as shall seem to it best, of the various charges of
misconduct presented in the motions filed in this court, and to
take such action thereon as justice may require.
I is s0 ordered.
