RELOJ CATTLE COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF PRIVATE LAND

CLAIMS.

No. 30. Argued and submitted October 21, 1901.-Decided March 17, 1902.

Ainsa v. United States, 161 U. S. 208, reaffirmed.
The grant asked to be confirmed was a grant by quantity according to the
laws when it was made.
As the lawful area of the grant was south of the boundary line between
the United States and Mexico, there could be no confirmation in this
country, and moreover, the owners had obtained full satisfaction thereof
from Mexico before this petition was filed, and no legal or equitable claim
therefor existed against the United States.
Claims for demasias or overplus, in respect of which the conditions were
unfulfilled, are imperfect claims, and such a claim as set up in this case
was barred by limitation.

THE Reloj Cattle Company, claiming to be the owner in fee
of a tract of land in the county of Cochise, Arizona, which it
described as the San Pedro grant, filed its petition for confirmation in the Court of Private Land Claims, May 29, 1897.
The petition alleged that the grant contained 37,000 acres in
the United States, and, by a sketch map attached, 19,000 acres
in the Republic of Mexico, or a total of 56,000 acres, within its
exterior boundaries. It gave a description of the grant by
courses and distances from certain natural objects, and relied
on a survey made by one Howe. The petition further alleged
that plaintiff was the owner of the tract by virtue of certain
instruments in writing, by which it had acquired from Rafael
Elias, the original grantee, title to all the property he had
therein; that the grant title bore date May 2, 1833, and was
duly made, executed and delivered by Don Jos6 Maria Mendoza, treasurer general of the State of Sonora, in the name of
that State, under and by virtue of article 11 of the general

RELOJ CATTLE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

sovereign decree No. 70, passed August 4, 1824, by the sovereign constituent congress of the United States of Mexico, which
article conceded to all of the States of the Republic the rents
or revenues which by said law were not reserved to the general
government, one of which revenues was the vacant lands within
the States of the Republic, thereby confirming to the States
the lands so described.
It was further averred that by law No. 30 of May 20, 1825,
and other decrees subsequent thereto, the constituent congress
of the State of Sonora and Sinaloa prescribed regulations for the
sale of such lands; that the initiatory proceeding to obtain the
grant title to the lands in question was by petition dated 1820
or 1821, addressed to the governor intendente, the officer of the
Spanish government in charge of and having exclusive jurisdiction in .the matter of the sales of public lands in the precinct
of Fronteras, in which precinct the lands petitioned for were
situated, which petition was made and signed by Jos6 Jesus
Perez, and proceedings thereon taken as required by the applicable royal ordinances of December 4, 1786 ; that thereafter,
on July 5, 1822, at Arispe, Sonora, the tract petitioned for was
sold by the proper officers to Perez for the sum of $190; that
on July 6 the intendente ordered Perez to pay into the treasury that sum, together with costs and charges; that on July 7
the sale was approved by the provincial imperial treasury at
Arispe, and was referred to the superior board of the treasury
for its approval or determination, and that thereafter the $190,
together with costs and charges, was paid into the national
treasury of the Republic of Mexico; but that the superior
board of the treasury was abolished before the sale was approved, and no further action was taken -until October 25, 1832,
when proceedings were instituted to transfer the rights and
title of Perez to Rafael Elias, and to have the formal title to
the lands issue to Elias; that in accordance therewith, on May 8,
1833, Jos6 Maria Mendoza, the treasurer general of the State
of Sonora, issued to Elias the final testimonia or evidence of
title to the grant, which was thereupon duly recorded in the
proper records of Sonora.
The petition alleged that the claim was presented by certain

grantors of petitioner to the surveyor general of Arizona, and
a report made by a duly authorized agent of the United States
to the effect that the expediente was among the archives in the
State of Sonora, and that all the proceedings were regular, and
the certificates showing payment and the record of the transfer
between Perez and Elias were properly recorded, and in the
proper place, among the archives of Sonora; that there was on
file in the office of the surveyor general of Arizona a report of
one Wharton, apparently acting under special instructions of
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in which he reported against the land grant, and that the land described
therein was situated in the State of Sonora, Mexico, but the
petition charged that the report was not made with full knowledge of the facts; and also that there was a report on file by
one Borton, apparently acting under instructions of the surveyor general of Arizona, of an indefinite character. And it
was alleged that beyond what was so stated the San Pedro
grant had not been acted on by Congress, or any other competent authority of the United States, constituted by law for the
adjustment of land titles within the Territory of Arizona.
The petition averred that all the proceedings in the matter
of the grant were regular, complete and legal, and vested a
perfect and valid title in fee thereto in the grantee; that the
grantee went into actual possession and erected proper monuments, and that the grantee and his descendants and legal representatives and assigns have continued until the present time
in the actual possession, use and occupation of the same, and
were seized and possessed in fee thereof ; that petitioner was
entitled to all of the lands embraced within the original survey
of the grant lying in the Territory of Arizona, and that they
were the lands delineated on the map filed with the petition;
and that there was no person in possession of the grant otherwise than by permission of petitioner, except one Roberts, who
was made a defendant. On May 13, 1899, plaintiff filed an
amended petition in which the description followed an amended
map and survey made by one Contzen, and attached to the
amended petition, which survey was the one relied on at the
trial, and made the contents of the grant within the United
States 38,622.06 acres,

RELOJ CATTLE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

The answer of the United States denied the correctness of
the surveys and maps of Howe and of Contzen, and alleged that
the tract, whether located according to quantity, or courses and
distances, or natural objects, was situated entirely south of the
boundary line between the Republics of the United States and
Mexico, and without the jurisdiction of the court.
The answer further denied that the claim set forth was at
the date of the treaty a complete and perfect title, and pleaded
the statute, whereby all imperfect claims not filed within two
years from March 3, 1891, became forever barred.
The answer also set up that under and pursuant to proceedings of denouncement, commenced in July, 1880, by the predecessors of the Reloj Cattle Company, the government of Mexico
measured off and delineated to said persons the legal area or
cabida legal of four sitios mentioned in claimant's title papers;
and in the same proceedings it was adjudged that the ranch of
San Pedro had no known boundary, and thus no surplus or demasias ; that the four sitios were measured off and delineated
to said persons by the Mexican government and located entirely
within the Republic of Mexico; and that the claim sued for was
thus entirely satisfied and discharged by the location of the
said four sitios within the Republic of MAlexico.
The case came on for hearing in June, 1899, at which time
there was offered in evidence for plaintiff a copy of the original
expediente of the San Pedro grant, from which it appeared that
in the year 1821 one Jos6 Jesus Perez presented the following
petition to the governor intendente:
"I, Don Jos6 de Jesus Perez, a resident of this capital, before
your excellency, in conformity with law, and in accordance
with the royal ordinances concerning land, laws, sanctions, and
rescripts that treat of the royal and abbatial lands with which
His Majesty (God perserve him) protects his vassals, as perquisites of his royal patrimony, appear and state: That, whereas
I enjoy some property, acquired in the military service and by
my own industry, without owning a place upon which to locate
and bring them together (centruarlos), I apply to the superior
authority of your excellency (with prior permission of my
father) in order that, pursuant to the provisions of the national

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

laws and the terms of the royal cedula of February 14, 1805,
the depopulated place down the San Pedro River, situate in
this province, toward the north, on the hostile frontier, close to
the adandoned place of Las Nutrias, be considered as registered,
in virtue of which I protest that I will enter into composition
with His Majesty (God preserve him) and will pay the quota
or cost of its purchase, the royal half annate tax, and whatever
else may be necessary, for such is rigorous justice with relation
to what is stated. In this understanding I pray you to issue
commission for the execution of the necessary proceeding,
ocular examination, reconnoissance of the ground, survey, appraisement, publication, possession, and final sale of the four
sitios, which will be surveyed for me in a square or oblong
figure, according to the length or extent of the land and its
direction, and in these terms I pray your excellency to defer to
my just petition, by which I shall receive grace. I protest
costs and whatever is necessary, etc."
March 12, 1821, this petition was referred by the governor
intendente for survey, appraisement and other customary proceedings, and for citation to the adjoining owners, with instructions to return the 'proceedings, when completed, for further
action. On May 3, 1821, a promotor fiscal, appraisers and recorder of courses were appointed by the constitutional alcalde
of the district and judge surveyor of that registry, who accepted their positions, took the proper oaths, and were duly
commissioned. On the same day publication of notice was had
to all whose rights might be affected to appear at the house of
San Pedro, the place of the proposed purchase; in response to
which one Antunes of the place of Terrenate, claiming certain
sitios in the vicinity, appeared and objected that if the survey
went up the river, or south, (the river ran north,) from the
house of San Pedro, it would interfere with his rights, to
which Perez's attorney objected, on the ground that if the survey went down the river, or north, it would deprive Perez of
the benefit of the water from the marsh, which was the mother
of those pastures. The matter was compromised by an agreement to divide the water of the marsh. This part of the expediente is of importance in respect of the contention that the

entire grant was south of the boundary line between the
United States and Mexico, and as to the starting point of the
primitive survey.
The survey was then proceeded with from the place of San
Pedro, and is set forth at length, and, having been concluded,
the alcalde May 21, 1821, directed that an appraisement and
valuation be made by the appraisers previously appointed, who
appraised the first three sitios at $60 each, and the remaining
one at $10. Thereupon the alcalde, reciting that the "four sitios of land for live stock" had been appraised and valued, required the proceedings to be forwarded to the promotor fiscal
for him to deduce, according to their condition, what he considered proper to the benefit of the public treasury. May 22,
the fiscal directed the alcalde to make inquiry as to whether
Perez had the qualifications required by law, and whether he
had sufficient property to protect these sitios, and finally
whether great advantage would result to the public treasury
by their protection and settlement. Testimony was taken, and,
the result of the inquiry being satisfactory to the fiscal, he directed, May 26, the publication for thirty days consecutively
of the appraisement of said lands, and provided for bids
thereon, and that the final sale and disposition of the land
should be at Arispe, before the provincial board of the royal
treasury, presided over by the governor intendente of the
province. Publication was thereupon had, the first being
as follows:
"On said day, month, and year, I, the judge surveyor, caused
Lazaro Quijada, at the sound of the drum and in a clear, loud,
and distinct voice, to announce: It is made public and notorious
that Don Jos6 Jesus Perez has registered the place of San Pedro, and, his petition being admitted, there were measured and
located and sold four sitios of land for large stock, which were
appraised and valued in the sum of one hundred and ninety
dollars, in virtue of which every one who believes he has a wellfounded right or desires to make a bid for the land mentioned
may apply, as his bid will be admitted and his actions reserved
till the day of the disposition and sale, which will be in Arispe
on the day designated by the governor intendente of the prov-

ince, to which end his actions and rights are reserved. And
no bidder having appeared I entered it as a minute, which I
signed, with those in my attendance, according to law, as I certify, and on this paper, without prejudice to the royal revenue."
The proclamations took place for thirty consecutive days, and
no one appearing to outbid Perez, the alcalde and judge surveyor, June 26, 1821, transmitted to Antonio Cordero, the governor intendente, "the proceedings of survey, ocular inspection,
appraisements, and publications executed on the depopulated
tract of San Pedro in favor of Don Jos6 Jes. Per6z, for your
excellency to make such order as may be just." The proceedings were referred to the promotor fiscal, and June 25, 1822,
he reported favorably thereon, and recommended that the celebration of the three customary offers be proceeded with in the
capital of the intendency, the city of Arispe, in solicitation of
bidders for the final sale of said land. On July 3, 1822, this
was ordered, and such offers were made July 3, 4 and 5, 1822,
at Arispe. The land described in the first offer was "four sitios
of royal land for raising cattle comprised in the place called
San Pedro, situate in the particular territory of the presidio of
Fronteras, surveyed for Don Jos6 Jesf Per6z, of this city, and
appraised in the sum of $190 at the rate of $60 for the first
three and $10 for the other one."
The final offer of sale was as follows:
"In the city of Arispe, on the 5th day of the month of July,
1822, having assembled as a board of sale in this said capital,
the intendente, as president, and the members who compose it,
for the purpose of making the third and last offer of the lands
to which these proceedings refer, they caused many individuals
to assemble, at the sound of the drum and the voice of the public crier, in the office of this intendency and Loreto Salcido
to proceed to make in their presence a publication, as he in effect did, similar in all respects to the one set out in the preceding offer, with only the difference of announcing to the public
that the final sale is now to be made to the highest and best
bidder. In which act appeared Don Jos6 Maria Serrano, as
attorney of Don Jos6 Jesus Perez, again offering the value of
the land, and the hour for midday prayer of this day having

already been struck, the public crier finally said: ' Once, twice,
three times; sold, sold, sold; may they do good, good, good,
to Don Jos6 Jes. Perez.' In these terms this act was concluded, the four sitios of royal land referred to in these proceedings being solemnly sold in favor of this party in interest for
the sum of one hundred and ninety dollars, and in due witness
thereof this minute was entered with the president and members of this board of sales, signed with the attorney, Don Jos6
Maria Serrano."
Thereupon the attorney of Perez prayed that "when the approval of the superior board of the treasury is obtained, there
may be issued in favor of my party the corresponding title of
grant and confirmation of the four sitios which said land contains, being prompt to appoint in Mexico a person under pay
and expenses to be charged with managing the present matter
at that court." July 6, 1822, the intendente ad interim, Bustamente, admitted Perez to composition with the imperial treasury
for said royal land, and ordered that his attorney be notified to
pay into the treasury the sum of two hundred and eight dollars,
one grain; one hundred and ninety "as the principal value at
which there were sold to said party in interest, the four sitios
which said tract comprises;" and the remainder taxes and expenses. The provincial board of the imperial treasury approved
the sale in favor of Perez the next day, describing the land as
being "the four sitios of royal land for raising large stock
which the place called San Pedro comprises." July 8, the sum
of two hundred and eight dollars, one grain, was paid into the
treasury at Arispe. No action appears to have been taken in
the matter by the superior board of the treasury, and it remained as it was until October 25, 1832, when Ignacio Perez,
on behalf of his brother Jos6 Jesfi Per6z, presented to the
treasurer general of the State of Sonora a petition alleging that
on July 5, 1832, there was sold in favor of his brother "the
land called San Pedro, situated in the jurisdiction of Fronteras,
including four sitios of land," and that he had lawfully exchanged the right he had thereto with citizen Rafael Elias, and
requesting that inasmuch as the corresponding title to the land
had not yet been issued, he might be pleased to order that title

Statement of the Case.

issue to said citizen Rafael Elias "as the actual owner and proprietor of the land of San Pedro." On that day the treasurer
general transmitted to the governor of Sonora the proceedings
"comprehensive of the registry, survey, appraisement, publications, and sale of four sitios of land, at the place called down
the San Pedro River, in favor of citizen Jos6 de Jesus Perez;"
that Perez had paid into the treasury "the sum of two hundred
and eight dollars, one grain, for the principal value of the land
and its corresponding taxes;" and that Perez desired the title
to be issued to Rafael Elias, complying at the same time with
article 27 of law No. 30 of May 20, 1825 ; and the treasurer reported that he considered the proceedings sufficient. October 31, 1832, Ignacio Bustamente, governor of Sonora, returned
the proceedings with this communication: "Having examined
the proceeding on the lands which your excellency transmits
with your note of the 25th ultimo, comprehensive of four sitios
surveyed at the place called down the San Pedro River, in favor
of Don Jos& Jesft Perez, I returned it to your excellency for
your excellency to issue to Don Rafael Elias a corresponding
title for the grant, in view of the exchange Don Ignacio Perez
of this place has made with him." iMendoza, thereupon, May 8,
1833, issued the grant, reciting: "Whereupon, in the exercise
of the powers which the laws confer upon me, by these presents
and in the name of the sovereign State of Sonora, I confer the
grant in the form of four sitios of land for breeding large cattle
and horses, which comprise the place named San Pedro, situate
in the jurisdiction of the presidio of Santa Cruz, in favor of the
citizen Rafael Elias, to whom I grant, give, and adjudicate these
lands by way of sale, with all the privileges, guaranties, and
stability which the laws provide, etc." And commanded that
the officials "do not permit that the said interested party nor
his successors be in any manner. disturbed in their peaceful enjoyment, nor molested in the free use, exercise, proprietorship,
dominion, and possession of the said four sitios of land which
comprise the place named San Pedro."
In the proceeding for the denouncement of the overplus of
the ranch of San Pedro subsequently had in Mexico, it is recited that the district judge "has before him the testimonio of

11ELOJ CATTLE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

the title of the grant of four sitios of land for raising large
stock issued by the citizen treasurer general of the State in the
city of Arispe under date of 8th of May of the year 1833, Jose
Manuel Mendoza, in favor of citizen Rafael Elias, and after
payment of two hundred and eight dollars, one grain, which
said Elias paid into the funds of said treasury as the value of
the four sitios, expenses and fees of the title. The land is generally known by the name of ranch of San Pedro, in the jurisdiction of the town of Santa Cruz and near the presidio of
Fronteras in the district of Magdalena." Plaintiff also introduced in evidence a copy of the titulo to the San Rafael del
Valle grant. Oral evidence was introduced on both sides in
respect of the original and subsequent surveys.
The government introduced a petition of the Eliases presented to the surveyor general, together with a map attached
to such petition. The government also introduced the expediente of the proceedings of denouncement of the demasias of the
ranch of San Pedro commenced July 8, 1880, on behalf of the
Elias family. On that day Manuel Elias made a formal denouncement " of the overplus that may be in the ranch of San
Pedro in the jurisdiction of the town of Santa Cruz in the district of Magdalena," of which ranch he alleged that he was a
cocwner. After considerable delays and after securing by appeal a declaration of his right to proceed to such denouncement, Elias on June 1, 1882, secured the Appointment of one
Pedro Molera, who was directed to "proceed to the resurvey
of the ranch of San Pedro, after examination of its titles and
citation of adjoining owners, marking on the ground as well as
on the respective maps the lawful area (cabida legal) of said
ranch and the overplus, (demasias), it may contain within its
monuments, subjecting his operations to the general laws of
July 22 and August 2, 1863." Molera accepted the appointment, and, July 19, 1882, appeared at the ranch of San Pedro.
His report recited that before proceeding with the survey he
found it necessary to make a reconnoissance of the land because the titles were decidedly obscure; and notwithstanding
the person who made the ancient survey gave the distances,
the courses were incomprehensible, and no description was

given of the places the title cited. He then set forth what he
did in respect of the general lines on which the grant should be
located, and proceeded to lay off the cabida total, or entire
area, within the exterior boundaries, so far as he could ascertain them. Having laid off the total area of 28,265.11 hectares
running up to the international line on the north, Molera on
July 28, 1882, proceeded to segregate the legal area (cabida
legal), which was for four square leagues. He described the
methods he adopted, and from the map and field notes it appeared that the legal area was 7061.61 hectares, which, deducted from the total area, left an overplus or demasias of
21,203.47 hectares. Orders were then given for the advertisement of the proceedings, and testimony was taken as to the
qualifications of Elias to secure the property. In April, 1884,
the district judge at Guaymas recited that it appeared that the
ranch of San Pedro belonged to various owners, who under the
law had equal rights to the demasias, and ordered that Manuel
Elias be notified to state whether or not he consented that said
demasias should be adjudged to him in company with the other
owners, and thereupon it was consented that the demasias
should be adjudged to all the owners. November 18, 1884, the
value of the demasias was fixed, but no price was fixed for the
cabida legal,since that part of the survey belonged to the original parties. The order of the district judge recites that having
examined the proceedings of survey and the map, both made
by the surveyor, Pedro Molera, from which it appears that
there is a total area of 28,265.11 hectares, of which 7061.64
hectares are covered by title and 21,203.47 hectares are demasias, and, having examined the other proceedings, decreed the
adjudication of said overplus to Jos6 Maria, Manuel and the
heirs of Jos6 Juan Elias in third parts, subject to the approval
of the department of public works. The proceedings were transmitted to that department at Mexico, and an error having been
found in the calculations were returned with orders to the surveyor to repeat the survey and correct the error. idvolera again
went into the field, and on March 19, 1887, made a recalculation
of the cabida total, with the result that the overplus was found to
be 21,231 hectares and a fraction instead of 21,203 and a fraction.

RELOJ CATTLE9 CO. v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.-

The correct valuation was thereupon made and the proceedings
again sent to Mexico. May 3, 1887, the department of public
works recited that they had examined the survey of the so-called
demasias, and observed that on such survey "no monuments
were found that would determine the limits or boundaries of said
ranch," and that the courses indicated in the primitive survey
were so confusing that in "attempting to follow them one goes
and returns repeatedly over the same line without it being possible to circumscribe with this data any perimeter whatever."
It was accordingly found and ordered that the ranch of San
Pedro had no known boundary or boundaries that could be
determined, and consequently had no demasias,so that the land
denounced was not demasias, but vacant public land; and that
Molera made an arbitrary survey. The adjudication was therefore not approved, and the office of the chief of the treasury in
the State of Sonora was directed to register the land and the
public treasurer to enter into possession of it, except that part
which had been sold to Mc~anus & Sons, and for which the
proper title had already been issued. This order was subsequently revoked as a matter of equity, and the purchase of the
property allowed so far as not conflicting with the McManus
grant. On July 4, 1887, on the petition of Elias, one Bonillas
was appointed surveyor for the purpose of separating the McManus land from the land sought by Elias, and to make a report that would enable the final purchase of the balance by
Elias's family to be effected. This survey gave the total area of
the San Pedro ranch, after cutting off the McManus land, as
22,058 hectares, 11 ares, 8 centiares, from which subtracting
the legal area (cabida lega) of 7022 hectares, 44 ares, there
remains an overplus of 15,035 hectares, 67 ares, 8 centiares.
(Hectare=2.471 acres.) February 21, 1888, the President of
the Republic approved the adjudication of this overplus in favor
of Elias and associates, and ordered the proper title to issue to
them upon payment of the required amount. The proper
amount was paid, and on October 15, 1888, Alejandro Elias,
for the Elias heirs, receipted for the title of said demasias, issued by President Diaz, February 24, 1888.
The government also introduced in evidence the expediente

OCTOBER TERAI, 1901.
Counsel for Parties.

of an adverse suit brought by Plutarco Elias respecting himself
and his mother and brothers on the denouncement of the overplus of the Agua Priete grant made by Camou Brothers, in
which, in deciding the matter, the district judge recited that
the fact that the Elias family had already denounced a large
area of demasias in the Republic of Mexico, and mentioned
many other tracts denounced by them besides the overplus of
the San Pedro ranch, and called attention to the fact that the
Eliases in consequence of such denouncements had secured a
larger grant than they were allowed to obtain under the law of
July 22, 1863. He quoted from the regulations of the department of public works in which the method of acquiring demasits
and other vacant lands is set forth, and showed from the order
of the department of public works that overplus within a grant
rests on exactly the same basis as other public lands, except that
under the provisions of the law of July 22, 1863, a preference
in its purchase is given the owner of the legal area. The district judge held that the Elias family had no right to be admitted as denouncers since they had already obtained an area
greater than that designated by law.
The Reloj Cattle Company was incorporated September 24,
1885, and various quitclaims of the interests of the Elias heirs
in eighteen thousand acres in the grant, described as being north
of the boundary line, commencing with April 2, 1883, and down
to October 13, 1885, were introduced by it as muniments of title.
The cause was submitted June 2, 1899, and November 27, 1899,
the court entered a decree rejecting the grant and dismissing
the petition. The court held that the grant was one of four
sitios only, and that the owners had secured full satisfaction
from the Mexican government and within its territory of all
that they were entitled to. Thereupon this appeal was prosecuted.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. CHIEF JusTIcE

FULLER

delivered the opinion of the court.

Perez petitioned for the grant "pursuant to the provisions of the
national laws and the terms of the royal cedula of February 14,
1805."
That cedula provided that, (for the reason "that the settlement of a sitio of a league in extent was very difficult for a
person of large means, and that lands of large area were held
without this legal obligation having been fulfilled to the prejudice of others,") "there should not be adjudicated nor granted
more than three or four tracts (to the wealthy), and two to the
poor;" "with the understanding that the lowest estimate was
not to be less than ten dollars for lands without water, thirty
for lands irrigable by means of wells, and sixty for those capable
of regular irrigation." Reynolds, p. 72. Recognizing the limth
itation, Perez prayed for the sale to him of " e four sitios."
The entire proceedings were directed to the acquisition of
four sitios. Four sitios were valued; four sitios were put up
at the auctions; four sitios were purchased; four sitios were
paid for; and four sitios were granted. The intention to convey
only so much and no more is plain, and is controlling. The
title of the grantee was limited to that quantity. Ainsa v.
United States, 161 U. S. 208; El's Administrator v. United
States, 171 U. S. 220; United States v. .AMaish, 171 U. S. 277;
Perrinv. United States, 171 U. S. 292.
The cabida legal, or lawful area, was, therefore, four sitios or
something over seventeen thousand three hundred and fifty
acres, and this lawful area, " th e four sitios," was described by
Perez as "the depopulated place down the San Pedro River,
situate in this province, toward the north, on the hostile frontier,
close to the abandoned place of Las Kutrias."
The primitive survey was at the place of San Pedro, and Las
Nutrias was two or three miles to the southwest. It is plain
that the old house of San Pedro was in existence at that time.
When Antunes appeared from the place of Terrenate, which
was a short distance west of the house of San Pedro, he was
willing that the survey should proceed "from the house of San
Pedro down the river," (the river ran north or somewhat east

of north,) while Perez claimed it should be located up the river
to get the benefit of the water of the marsh. This dispute was
compromised by agreeing to divide the water of the marsh,
which lay some distance above the house of San Pedro. The
starting point of the survey was plainly up the river from the
house, and then the line ran below it, for the survey states: "I
caused a monument to be placed at a rectangular corner, from
which, taking the course southwest to northwest, there were
measured and counted fifty cords, the last of which terminated
down the river from the house, on the edge of the ford, on the
bank." That the house of San Pedro was an important call in
the location of the grant on the ground is unquestionable. That
house was the ancestral home of the Elias family, and on that
place some of its members still reside. It was and is in Mlexico,
several miles south of the boundary line. Accordingly when
Manuel Elias made a formal denouncement, July 8, 1880, of the
dema.ias there might be in the ranch of San Pedro, and it became necessary to mark the cabida legal on the ground, the
Mexican authorities laid off the four sitios so as to embrace the
San Pedro settlement. The omission of San Pedro from the
lawful area of the San Pedro grant would have, indeed, been
something remarkable. The owners of the grant th us obtained
from Mexico full satisfaction of its cabida legal, and no legal or
equitable claim therefor existed against the United States when
this petition was filed.
In Ain a v. UTnitedZ States, 161 U. S.234, it was said: "We
have referred to the proceedings of 1882, 1886, in Mexico, as
furnishing persuasive evidence of the proper construction of
this grant under Mexican law, and it may be further observed
that the adjudication of the overplus required the location of
the 7 sitios, which location Mexico, as the granting government, assumed it had the right to make, and made out of the
land within its jurisdiction. In this way the grant was satisfied by the receipt of all the grantees had bought and were
entitled to under the Mexican law, the result as to the overplus
inuring to Camou's cotenants by the terms of his petition."
In Ely's Administrator v. United States, 171 U. S.220, the
court, referring to Ainsa's case, observed: "In that case it ap-

peared that while the boundaries of the survey extended into
the territory ceded by Mexico to the United States, the grantee
had taken and was in possession of land still remaining within
the limits of Mexico to the full extent which he had purchased
and paid for, and therefore no legal or equitable claim existed
against the United States in reference to the land within the
ceded territory." It is quite impossible to entertain the proposition that the Court of Private Land Claims should have adjudged to appellants another cabida Zegal on this side of the
boundary line. According to the doctrine of Ely's case no different location could have been recognized if the entire area
had been in this country.
Something is said in respect of the right to confirmation of
the tract sued for treated as demasias. But, apart from other
insuperable objections to that suggestion, such a claim would
be imperfect for want of fulfillment of conditions, and barred
by section 12 of the act of March 3, 1891.

AINSA v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF PRIVATE LAND OL-AkS.
No. 40. Argued January 29, 1902.-Decided

farch 17, 1902.

This case is governed by Reloj Cattle Company v. United States, just decided.
The grant was a grant by quantity, and the lawful area was south of the
international boundary line, and had been set off to the owners by Mexico.
The right to acquire demaslas or overplus was not a vested right, and
where the conditions were unfulfilled in accordance with the terms of
the grant at the time of the cession, claims to cemasias cannot be conz
firmed.

THIs was a petition filed February 28, 1893, by Ainsa, as administrator, against the United States and one Whitney, for

confirmation of the Agua Prieta grant, so called, which he
represented he owned by virtue of "a grant title," dated De-
