the only remedy which might be resorted to by the State was
the one therein provided for; that, in the language of Chief
Justice Marshall, "the distinction between the obligation of a
contract and a remedy given by the legislature to enforce that
obligation exists in the nature of things, and without impairing
the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be
modified as the wisdom of the nation may direct." Sturges v.

UNITED STATES v. RIO GRANDE DAM AND IRRIGATION COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF NEW
MEXICO.

No. 239. Argued November 14,15, 1901.-Decided March 3, 1902.

The motion made in the court below on behalf of the United States for a
continuance of this cause and the application for a rehearing were ad-

dressed to the discretion of the trial court, and this court cannotreverse
the decree below merely upon the ground that the trial court erred in its
denial of those motions; but, as it is quite clear that the record does not
contain evidence of a material character, and that the absence of such

evidence is due to the action of the trial court in not giving sufficient
time to the Government to prepare its case, this court cannot resist the
conviction that if it proceeds to a final decree upon the present record
great wrong may be done; and it reverses the decree below, without considering the merits, and remands the case with orders that leave should
be granted to both sides to adduce further evidence.

THE case is stated in the opinion of the court.

UNITED STATES v. RIO GRANDE IRRIGATION CO. 417
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTIoE HARL&w delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit presents a contest between the United States and
the appellee corporations as to the right asserted by the latter
to construct over and near the Rio Grande a certain dam and
reservoir for the purpose of appropriating the waters of that
river in their private business.
By the seventh article of the treaty of February 2, 1848, between the United States and the Republic of Mexico it is provided that "the river Gila, and the part of the Rio Bravo del
Norte lying below the southern boundary of New Mexico, being, agreeably to the fifth article, divided in the middle between
the two Republics, the navigation of the Gila and of the Bravo
below said boundary shall be free and common to the vessels
and citizens of both countries; and neither shall, without the
consent of the other, construct any work that may impede or
interrupt, in whole or in part, the exercise of this right; not
even for the purpose of favoring new methods of navigation.
The stipulations contained in the present article shall
not impair the territorial rights of either Republic within its
established limits." 9 Stat. 928. And by the fourth article of
the treaty of December 30, 1853, between the same countries,
it was further provided that "the several provisions, stipulations and restrictions contained in the seventh article of the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo shall remain in force only so far
as regards the Rio Bravo del Norte, below the initial of the
said boundary provided in the first article of this treaty, that
is to say, below the intersection of the 310 47' 30' parallel of
latitude, with the boundary line established by the late treaty
dividing said river from its mouth upwards, according to the
fifth article of the treaty of Guadalupe." 10 Stat. 1034.
Again, by a convention between the United States and Mexico, concluded December 26, 1890, provision was made for an
international boundary commission, empowered, upon application by the local authorities, to inquire whether any works were
being constructed on the Rio Grande which were forbidden by
treaty stipulations. 26 Stat. 1512.

of September 19, 1890, c. 907, provided: "That the creation of
any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by law, to the navigable capacity of any waters, in respect of which the United
States has jurisdiction, is hereby prohibited. The continuance
of any such obstruction, except bridges, piers, docks and wharves,
and similar structures erected for business purposes, whether
heretofore or hereafter created, shall constitute an offence, and
each week's continuance of any such obstruction shall be deemed
a separate offence. Every person and every corporation which
shall be guilty of creating or continuing any such unlawful obstruction in this act mentioned, or who shall violate the provisions of the last four preceding sections of this act, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars,
or by imprisonment (in the case of a natural person) not exceeding one year, or by both such punishments, in the discretion of
the court, the creating or continuing of any unlawful obstruction in this act mentioned may be prevented and such obstruction may be caused to be removed by the injunction of any
Circuit Court exercising jurisdiction in any district in which
such obstruction may be threatened or may exist; and proper
proceedings in equity to this end may be instituted under the
direction of the Attorney General of the United States." 26
Stat. 426, 451, ยง 10.
These treaties with the above and other acts of Congress being in force, the present suit was brought, May 24, 1897, in the
District Court for the Third Judicial District of New Mexicothe plaintiff being the United States of America, and the original defendant being the Rio Grande Dam and Irrigation Company, a corporation of that Territory. By an amended bill, the
Rio Grande Irrigation and Land Company-a British corporation doing business in the Territory of New Mexico-was also
made defendant. The latter corporation, it is alleged, was
organized as an adjunct and agent of the New Mexico corporation.
The bill and amended bill show that the object of the suit was
to obtain a decree enjoining the defendants from commencing
or attempting to construct or build a certain dam and reservoir

UNITED STATES v. RIO GRANDE IRRIGATION CO. 419
Opinion of the Court.

or any other dam, breakwater, reservoir or other structure, or
obstruction of any character whatsoever, "across the Rio Grande
or the waters thereof, or from maintaining such dam or obstruction in the Territory of New Mexico, and especially at Elephant
Butte in said Territory, or any other point on said river in said
Territory of New Mexico, as shall affect the navigable capacity
of said Rio Grande at any point throughout its course, whether
in the Territory of New Mexico or elsewhere."
The court of original jurisdiction said it was a fact of which
it could take judicial notice, and it adjudged, that the Rio
Grande was not navigable within the Territory of New Mexico,
and it dissolved the injunction theretofore granted against the
defendants, and dismissed the suit. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Territory that decree was affirmed, August 24, 1890.
The case was then brought here by appeal. This court in its
opinion rendered May 22, 1899, among other things said that
to assert that Congress intended by its legislation "to confer
upon any State the right to appropriate all the waters of the
tributary streams which unite into a navigable watercourse, and
so destroy the navigability of that watercourse in derogation of
the interests of all the people of the United States, is a construction which cannot be tolerated. It ignores the spirit of
the legislation and carries the statute to the verge of the letter
and far beyond what under the circumstances of the case must
be held to have been the intent of Congress."
United Statev v.
Rio Grande Dam and -rrigation Company, 17 I U. S. 690, 708,
710.
Referring especially to the above act of September 19, 1890,
the court also said: "It is urged that the true construction of this act limits its applicability to obstructions in the
navigable portion of a navigable stream, and that as it appears
that although the Rio Grande may be navigable for a certain
distance above its mouth, it is not navigable in the Territory of
New Mexico, this statute has no applicability. The language
is general, and must be given full scope. It is not a prohibition
of any obstruction to the navigation, but any obstruction to the
navigable capacity, and anything, wherever done or however

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

done, within the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States,
which tends to destroy the navigable capacity of one of the
navigable waters of the United States, is within the terms of
that prohibition. Evidently Congress, perceiving that the time
had come when the growing interests of commerce required
that the navigable waters of the United States should be subjected to the direct control of the National Government, and
that nothing should be done by any State tending to destroy
that navigability without the explicit assent of the National
Government, enacted the statute in question. And it would be
to improperly ignore the scope of this language to limit it to
the acts done within the very limits of navigation of a navigable stream.

.

.

.

The question always is one of fact, whether

such appropriation substantially interferes with the navigable
capacity within the limits where navigation is a recognized
fact." 174 U. S.690, 708.
The decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory was reversed by this court, and the cause was remanded "with instructions to set aside the decree of dismissal, and to order an inquiry into the question whether the intended acts of the defendants in the construction of a dam and in appropriating the
waters of the Rio Grande will substantially diminish the navigability of that stream within the limits of present navigability, and if so, to enter a decree restraining those acts to the
extent that they will so diminish."
The mandate of this court, based upon its final order of May 22,
1899, was issued June 24, 1899. On the 14th of July, 1899, the
Supreme Court of the Territory remanded the cause to the court
of original jurisdiction to be there proceeded with in accordance with our mandate.
On the 5th day of August, 1899, the District Court heard,
at chambers, an application of the defendants, based on notice
to the United States, to set the cause for final hearing upon
evidence taken under the mandate of the Supreme Court of the
Territory. That application was sustained, and the cause was
set for final hearing on the 1st day of November, 1899.
Subsequently, October 17, 1899, the United States moved the
court for a further continuance and extension of time for the

UNITED STATES v. RIO GRANDE IRRIGATION CO. 421
Opinion of the Court.

hearing of the cause, until February 5, 1900, or such other date
as the court deemed reasonable and proper. The grounds upon
which the motion was based were stated in writing, as follows:
"That said plaintiffs have been and are unable to collect and
present to this honorable court the necessary and proper evidence and oral testimony from witnesses for a proper presentation of the plaintiffs' side of said cause, notwithstanding having
used due diligence to that end, all of which will more fully appear from an affidavit hereto attached and made a part of this
motion in support thereof, and to which the court is respectfully referred. The plaintiffs, as a condition for the extension
of time for the taking of testimony for the trial of said cause,
have offered and hereby offer to enter into any proper and reasonable stipulation to enable the Supreme Court of the Territory of New Mexico to take jurisdiction of any appeal which
may be taken by either party at its ensuing January term, and
dispose of the cause during said term, or at any adjourned session of the same."
In support of its motion for continuance, the Government
filed the affidavit of its attorney, Mr. Burch, who was specially
charged with the duty of representing its interests in this litigation. That affidavit is too lengthy to be embodied in this
opinion. It is sufficient to say that it fully supported the
grounds of the motion made by the Government for further
time.
The motion for a continuance was sustained only so far as to
fix December 12, 1899, as the date for the final hearing of the
cause. The hearing was commenced on the latter day, and
continued from day to day until December 21, 1899, when the โข
cause was taken under advisement. On the 2d day of January, 1900, a finding of facts was filed in the court. In the last
paragraph of that finding it was stated "that the intended acts
of the defendants in the construction of a dam or dams, or reservoirs, and in appropriating the waters of the Rio Grande,
will not substantially diminish the navigability of that stream
within the limits of the present navigability." The court ordered a decree to be prepared dismissing the bill

aside the findings and grant a rehearing upon the ground of
newly discovered evidence which could not by any reasonable
diligence on its part have been discovered and procured for use
on the hearing of the cause. The grounds of the motion were
stated in writing and were abundantly sustained by the affidavits filed therewith.
The motion for rehearing was denied, and by a final order,
entered January 9, 1900, the bill was dismissed. From that
order the present appeal was prosecuted.
At the argument of the cause our attention was called to the
action of the District Court in setting the cause for final hearing
at a date so early as the first day of November, 1899; to the
denial of the motion made on behalf of the United States on
the 17th of October, 1899, to extend the time for final hearing
to February 5, 1900; and to the order denying the motion,
made after the facts were found but before final decree, for a
rehearing. The making of the last order was specially assigned
for error.
The inquiry which this court directed to be made, namely,
whether the intended acts of the defendants in the construction
of a dam and in appropriating the waters of the Rio Grande
would substantially diminish the navigability of that stream.
within the limits of present navigability was not only of great
importance, but was one that could not properly be made and
concluded within the time ordinarily required for the preparation of an equity cause for final hearing. We think that the
District Court, upon the showing made by the Government,
might well have granted the motion to postpone the final hearing to a date later than that fixed. We make the same observations in reference to the motion for a rehearing in respect of
the facts to be specially found, supported by affidavits as to
newly discovered evidence, and made before the final decree
was entered. The evidence set forth in those affidavits, if it
had been brought before the court, would, we think, have materially strengthened the case of the United States.
But the motion for the continuance of the cause, and the application for a rehearing, were addressed to the discretion of
the trial court; and it is well settled that matters of discretion

or practice cannot, generally speaking, be made the basis of an
appeal, and do not constitute in themselves grounds-for the reversal of a final decree. 2 Daniell's Ohy. P1. & Prac. 5th ed.

Railway Co. v. Shuble, 109 U. S. 381, 384. We cannot therefore reverse the decree merely upon the ground that the trial
court erred in its denial of the motions to which we have referred.
But there are other considerations which may be properly
made the basis for the reversal of the decree to the end that
injustice may not be done. As upon this appeal in equity the
whole case is before us, we can render such decree as under all
the circumstances may be proper. Ridings v. Johnson, 128
U. S. 212, 218. If it appears that injustice may be done by
proceeding to a final decree upon the record as it is presented
to us, we have the power to forbear a determination of the
merits and remand the cause for further preparation.
In Estho v. Lear, 7 Pet. 130-1, involving the validity of a
certain paper purporting to be and which had been recorded as
the last will and testament of Kosciuszko, the bill charged that
the paper was not a will. The bill made no reference to any
other will. The answer insisted that the will referred to in the
bill was a valid instrument and operative. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said: "Before the court can decide the intricate questions which grow out of this will, we think
it necessary to possess some information which the record does
not give." It appearing that the testator had made another
will, which was not in the record, the court said that "since
we are informed of its existence, it would be desirable to see it.
We do not think the case properly prepared for decision; and
therefore direct that the decree be reversed and the cause remanded, with liberty to the plaintiff to amend his bill." In
United States v. Galbraith,22 How. 89, 96, the question was as

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

to the validity of a claim for five leagues of land. The Board
of Land Commissioners decided against the United States, upon
the ground that there was an absence of any rebutting testimony that would overcome the prima facie case made by the
claimant. Speaking by iMr. Justice Nelson, this court said that
it was "of opinion that, in consideration of the doubtful character of the claim, and entire want .of any merits upon the testimony, the decree of the court below should be reversed, and
the case remitted for further evidence and examination." In
Illinois Central Railroadv. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, one of the
questions arising in the pleadings was whether the Illinois Central Railroad Company was entitled to maintain certain docks,
piers and wharves on the lake front at Chicago. The Circuit
Court decided that question in favor of the railroad company.
But this court was of opinion that the evidence in the record
was not adequate for the determination of that question, and
upon its own motion reversed the decree and remanded the
cause with directions for further investigation, as to enable the
court to determine whether the structures in question extended
into the lake beyond the point of practical navigability, having
reference to the manner in which commerce was conducted on
the lake.
In the present case it is quite clear that the record does not
contain evidence of a material character, and that the absence
of such evidence is due to the action of the trial court in not
giving sufficient time to the Government to prepare its case.
We cannot resist the conviction that if we proceed to a final
decree upon the present record, great wrong may be done to
the United States, as well as to all interested in preserving the
navigability of the Rio Grande. As the record does not show
that the representatives of the Government were chargeable
with want of diligence in their preparation of the cause, we
think that the decree should be reversed and the cause remanded,
with liberty to both parties to take further evidence.
We are the better satisfied with this disposition of the case
because the questions presented may involve rights secured by
treaties concluded between this country and the Republic of
-exico.
As the latter country cannot be indifferent to the re-

sult of this litigation and is not a party to the record the court
ought not to determine the important question before us in the
absence of material evidence, which we are not at liberty upon

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 201. Argued November 6, 1901.-Decided March 3,1902.
If, looking at all the circumstances which attend, or may ordinarily attend
the pursuit of a particular calling, a State thinks that certain admitted
evils cannot be successfully reached unless that calling be actually prohibited, the courts cannot interfere unless, looking through mere forms

and at the substance of the matter, they can say that the statute, enacted'
professedly to protect the public morals, has no real or substantial relation to that object, but is a clear, unmistakable infringement of rights
secured by the fundamental law.
It must be assumed with regard to section 130 of the Criminal Code of Illinois touching options to sell or buy grain or other property at a future
time, that the legislature of the State was of opinion that an effectual
mode to suppress gambling grain contracts was to declare illegal all op
tions to sell or buy at a future time; and this court cannot say that the
means employed were not appropriate to the end sought to be attained
and which it was competent for the State to accomplish.
This court cannot adjudge that the legislature of Illinois transcended the
limits of constitutional authority, when it enacted the statute in question.
