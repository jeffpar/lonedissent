ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

THE UNITED

STATES

FOE THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 146. Argued December 5,6,1889. -Decided

December 16, 1889.

A contract between the parties as to the sale of, and payment for, a ranch
and cattle, interpreted as to the mode of payment provided for.
Where a defendant, on a trial, introduces, under the objection of the plaintiff, parol evidence of what occurred in negotiations between the parties
prior to the making of a contract between them, with a view to the construction of the contract, he cannot on a writ of error to review a judgment against him, allege as error the admission of such evidence.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

_Mr S. V_ W7Tte (with whom was .Mr Charles TV Gould
on the brief) for plaintiff in error.
_M eT B. Johnson and .Mr Carles . Pope (with whom
were Mr John L. Peak and XU A. XcCoy on the brief) for
defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is.an action at law, brought in the Superior Court of
Cook County, Illinois, by Milton H. Bennett and Robert L.
Dunman against Edward M. McGillin, and removed by the
defendant into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
N\orthern District of Illinois. The suit was brought to recover
the sum of $108,150, with interest at six per cent per annum
from the 15th of July, 1885. The defendant pleaded the general issue and sundry special pleas. The plaintiffs demurred
to the latter, the demurrer was sustained, and leave to amend
the pleas was denied. There was also a plea of set-off, to
which there was a replication, joining issue, and there was a
similiter to the plea of the general issue. On the written
waiver of a jury, the case was tried before the court, which
found the issues for the plaintiffs, and also made special find-

rags, and assessed the damages of the plaintiffs, at $115,580.55,
for which amount, with costs, judgment was entered in their
favor. To review that judgment, the defendant has brought
a writ of error.
The suit was founded on a written instrument, dated April
16, 1885, a copy of which, as set out in the first count of the
plaintiff's declaration, is contained in the margin.'

made by the court. The material parts of those findings are
as follows: The parties executed the contract sued on. At the
date of its execution, the defendant paid to the plaintiffs
$25,000, and also delivered to them his promissory notes of
that date for $75,000, due and payable July 25, 1885, with interest at eight per cent per annum. Those notes were thereafter, and before maturity, transferred for value, and were,
after the commencement of this suit, paid in full by the defendant to the legal holders thereof. On and prior to July 14,
1885, the plaintiffs delivered to the defendant, and he accepted,
the ranch and ranch outfit, as called for and described in the
contract, and he took possession of the same, and, at the same
time, they delivered to him 4854 head of the cattle called for by
the contract, which were accepted by him, and were the only
cattle delivered b.y them to him on the contract. There was
a deficiency of '[646 cattle in the number called for by the contract. This deficiency, at the rate of $25 per head, amounted
to. $191,150, which the defendant was entitled to have credited
upon the $400,000 winch he was, by the contract, to pay to the
plaintiffs for the ranch, ranch outfit and cattle. The failure
of the plaintiffs to deliver the full number of cattle called for
by the contract was by reason of heavy losses of cattle sustained by them, from cold and starvation, during the winter of
1884 and the spring of 1885, whereby their herd was reduced
from about the number called for by the contract to the number actually delivered. When they made the contract they in
pressly reserving the right, power and authority to advertise and sell any
or all of said property by giving thirty days' notice of the time and place
of such sale in some daily newspaper published in the city of Kansas,
Jackson County, Missouri, if said sums, together with all the interest due
thereon, are not paid when due, according to the terms and tenor of the
notes to be executed by the said Edward M. McGillin therefor.

Opinion of the Court.

good faith believed that they had, and should be able to deliver to the defendant, the full number of 12,500 head, and
were not aware of the losses until they attempted to round
up or collect their cattle, at about the time the delivery was to
be made. Neither the defendant nor his agents or employes
had any information that the plaintiffs would not be able to
deliver the 12,500 head of cattle, until notified by the latter, on
the 14th of July, 1885, that they had delivered all the cattle
belonging to the ranch, and could not deliver any more. Before the 1st of July, 1885, the defendant had caused a deed to
be made out, and signed and aclmowledged by himself and his
wife, conveying to the plaintiffs the eighty-four acres of land
in Cook County, Illinois, mentioned in the contract, but there
was an apparent incumbrance upon the land, as shown by the
record of land titles in Cook County, by a trust-deed dated
June 28, 1878, to one Manning, as trustee, to secure the payment of $40,000 from the defendant to one Sawyer, and that
trust-deed was not released and discharged until December 5,
1885, but, in fact, the indebtedness secured thereby had been
fully paid on or before July 1, 1885. On the 15th of July,
1885, the plaintiffs did not transfer, or offer to transfer, to the
defendant the two leases mentioned m the contract, and the
parties agreed to meet at Kansas City, Missouri, within a few
days after the said 15th of July, and then endeavor to adjust
and settle all differences between them in regard to the contract.
They did so meet in Kansas City, on the 17th of July, and the
defendant then offered to convey to the plaintiffs the eightyfour acres of land in Cook County, on their paying to him
$59,150, which conveyance the plaintiffs refused to accept on
those terms. Thereupon, the defendant, to avoid litigation
and as a compromise, as he said, offered to convey to the plaintiffs fifty-four acres of the Cook County land, in full payment
of the balance due from him to them for the ranch and cattle.
The plaintiffs refused to accept such offer; but the defendant
did not tender any deed, either of the whole or of any part of
the land. After such delivery of the ranch, ranch property
and cattle to the defendant, the plaintiffs insisted that there
was due to them from him $108,850, which should be divided

into two equal amounts and secured by the notes of the defendant, one payable on July 1, 1886, and the other on November 1, 1886, with interest on each note at the rate of eight
per cent per annum. The plaintiffs also insisted that the sum
of $191,150, to be credited to the defendant on the $400,000
purchase price to be paid for the ranch and cattle, should be
applied as a credit to extinguish the payment to be made in
the Cook County land. But the defendant refused to give the
notes for $108,850, as demanded by the plaintiffs, and insisted
that there was no cash payment or money due from him to
them. The defendant declined to settle unless the plaintiffs
would take in settlement the Cook County land. Thereupon,
the defendant, by way of compromise, offered to the plaintiffs
that if they would repay to him the $25,000 cash paid by him,
and would return to him his notes for $75,000, given under the
contract, he would surrender to them the possession of all
property delivered, throw up the contract, and stand the loss
of all moneys, amounting to about $5000, expended by him on
the ranch. The plaintiffs declined this offer, stating that they
had used the money and parted with the notes, and that the
acceptance of the offer was entirely beyond their control. At
the meeting in Kansas City, the plaintiffs advised the defendant
of the amount which they had advanced for rent on the leases
named in the contract, subsequently to July 15, 1885, and
which was to be refunded by the defendant, and thereafter
the latter paid said rental, and the plaintiffs duly transferred
the leases to him. In the preliminary negotiations between
the parties, which resulted in the contract, the defendant insisted that he would not purchase the ranch and cattle at the
price of $400,000, unless the plaintiffs would take his Cool
County land at the sum of $168,000, and the plaintiffs insisted
that they would not sell for $400,000, unless they could receive
about $250,000 in money, being willing to take the balance
of such purchase price in the eighty-four acres of Cook County
land. Before the contract was entered into, and while the negotiations for it were going on, the plaintiff Bennett visited
Chicago and examined the Cook County land.
On these findings of fact, the court found against the de-

Opinion of the Court.

fendant, and he made a motion to set aside such finding, and
for a new trial. The motion was denied, and the defendant
excepted. He then moved in arrest of judgment, but the
motion was denied, and he excepted. The court then rendered
judgment upon the findings, in favor of the plaintiffs and
against the defendant, and the latter excepted. There is no
exception by the defendant to any ruling of the court in the
course of the trial, and the only question open for consideration is whether the judgment is supported by the special
findings.
The opinion of the Circuit Court, held by Judge Blodgett,
accompanying its findings and forming part of the record, is
reported as Bennett v. McOGillin, 28 Fed. Rep. 411. The opinion
states that the controversy in the case is as to whether the plaintiffs were bound to accept the Cook County land at the price
of $168,000, and make up in cash the deficiency in that price,
or whether the plaintiffs could insist that the credit for the
$191,150 shortage on the cattle should be applied first to extinguish the payment of $168,000 to be made in Cook County
land, and then upon the amount to be secured by the $132,000
of notes to fall due in July and November, 1886, thus leaving
a balance of $108,150 due to the plaintiffs, and that the suit
to recover that balance was brought on the ground that, the
defendant having refused to give his notes, such balance became at once a money demand.
The court took the view that when the actual count of the
cattle showed a shortage of 7646 head in the number necessary
to make up the 12,500, the defendant might properly have
refused to accept the property, and have put the plaintiffs in
default on their part of the contract, but that he elected to
accept what the plaintiffs had to deliver, and must be held to
have assented thereby to such readjustment of the terms of
the contract as was made necessary by the changed facts,
that the contract gave to the defendant the option of paying
$168,000 of the purchase-money by conveying the Cook County
land, that if the defendant declined to make the conveyance,
or was unable to give a good title, the $168,000 would at once
become a money payment, payable in cash on the 15th of July,

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

1885, and that, if the plaintiffs delivered the whole number
of 12,500 cattle, they would be entitled to the two notes of
$66,000 each, and also to a deed of the Cook County land, or
to the $168,000 in cash, in case the defendant should refuse,
or be unable, to make a deed.
The court was, therefore, of opinion that the $168,000 was to
be treated as a present or cash payment, that the deficiency
in cattle, of $191,150, being 7646 head at $25 per head, which
was to be credited to the defendant, should be appropriated
in liquidation of the cash payment of $168,000, such credit
being thus applied to the cash payment which the defendant
would be called upon to make in case he should be unable to
make the title at the time called for; that the $168,000 to be
liquidated by the land was a present payment, whether made
in money or land that if, by the terms of the contract, the
defendant was entitled to a credit equal to or exceeding the
$168,000, that credit should be applied thereon, rather than
upon the deferred payments to be evidenced by notes, because
the $168,000 was a payment down, to be made on the 15th of
July, 1885, that, therefore, as $100,000 had been paid in cash
on the $400,000 purchase price, leaving $300,000 due, a credit
thereon of the $191,150 deficiency in cattle left due to the
plaintiffs $108,850, for which amount the court held that the
defendant should have given his notes, payable in July and
November, 1886, with interest, at eight per cent per annum, and
that, as he declined to give such notes, or any notes, such
balance became a present demand, for which the plaintiffs
could sue. It therefore ordered judgment for the plaintiffs,
for $108,850, with interest at six per cent from July 15, 1885.
Although, as appears by the bill of exceptions, the defendant at the trial introduced evidence, under the objections and
exceptions of the plaintiffs, of the circumstances attending the
execution of the contract, of the relative situation of the
parties, and of the negotiations, correspondence, and interviews between them and their agents, leading up to its execution, to enable the court better to understand and construe
the contract, the defendant now seriously alleges as error the
admission of such parol evidence. The point is not tenable.

McGILLIIT v. BENNETT.
Opinon of the Court.

It appears, from the findings of fact, that the court considered
the evidence so introduced by the defendant, and he cannot
now object to it.
We are of opinion that the conclusion of law of the Circuit
Court, from the findings of fact, was correct. Of course, the
credit of $191,150 for the 7646 head of cattle deficient, at $25
per head, was not intended by the contract to be applied on
the cash payment of $25,000, made April 16, 1885, or on the
payment of $75,000 provided for by the promissory notes
made April 16, 1885, and due July 25, 1885. The question of
a shortage in the number of cattle was not to be determined,
and was not determined, before the 15th of July, 1885, and
the contract does not provide for repaying any part of the
$100,000. Therefore, the credit of $191,150 could be applied
only on the $300,000 remaimng unpaid on the 15th of July,
1885. On that day, the payment of $168,000 was to be made.
By the contract, if there was an excess of cattle over 12,500
head, the payment to be made by the defendant on that day
would be more than $168,000, (exclusive of the $132,000 payable in 1886,) but that excess was to be paid in cash. If there
was a shortage in the number of cattle, and a credit to be
made to the defendant therefor on the $400,000 purchase price,
the amount of that credit was- to be made on the 15th of July,
1885, the same day the $168,000 was to be paid. It is clear,
therefore, that the amount of the excess was to be added to
that payment, or the amount of the credit was to be deducted
therefrom. The payment to be made on the 15th of July,
1885, would be greater or less than the $168,000, as the number of cattle exceeded or fell short of 12,500 head. The
$108,850 became due July 15, 1885, and the defendant, ac-o
cording to the terms of the contract, ought then to have given
his notes therefor, payable, one-half July 1, 1886, and onehalf November 1, 1886. lie refused to give such notes. As
the payments to be made Xuly 1, 1886, and November 1, 1886,
were not due on July 15, 1885, and a vendors' lien was expressly reserved in respect of those payments, there is no
solution of the problem, except to deduct from the $191,150
deficiency in cattle the $168,000 payment to be made in land
