BRUSH v. CONDIT.
APPEAL

FROM THE

CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE

UNITED

STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 9. Argued October 15, 16,1889. - Decided November 4,1889.

Claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 of reissued letters patent No. 8718, granted May 20,
187p, to Charles F. Brush for "improvements in electric lamps," the
original patent, No. 203,411 having been granted to said Brush May 7,
1878, are invalid by reason of their prior existence as perfected inventions in a lamp made in June, 1876, by one Hayes.
Although claims 5 and 6 speak of an "annular clamp," and the apparatus of
Hayes had a rectangular clamp, the latter embodied the principle of the
invention, carried out by equivalent means, the improvement, if any, in
the use of the circular clamp over the rectangular clamp being only a
question of degree in the use of substantially the same means.

MR. JUsT'cE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal by the plaintiffs, Charles F Brush and
The Brush Electric Company, in a suit in equity brought by
them in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern
District of New York, against C. :Harrison Condit, Joseph
Hanson and Abraham Van Winkle, from a decree dismissing
with costs their bill of complaint, so far as it relates to reissued
letters patent No. 8718, granted May 20, 1879, to Charles F
Brush, one of the plaintiffs, for "improvements in electric
lamps," on an application for a reissue filed April 14, 1879,
the original letters patent, No. 203,411, having been granted

to said Brush May 7, 1878 on an application filed September
28, 1877.
The rights of the plaintiffs were finally rested upon an
alleged infringement of claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 of the reissue.
Another patent was sued on in the case, but at the final hearmg the bill in regard to it was dismissed with costs, on motion
of the plaintiffs. The opinion of the Circuit Court, held by
Judge Shipman, on the merits, as to reissue No. 8718, is
reported in 22 Blatchford, 246.
The specification of the reissue states the general nattfre of
the invention in these words "]My invention relates to electric
light mechanism, and it consists in the following specified
device, or its equivalent, whereby the carbon sticks usually
employed are automatically adjusted and kept in such position
and relation to each other that a continuous and effective light
shall be had without the necessity of any manual interference." In this automatic arrangement, the electric arc is
established, and then, as the electrodes are consumed, the arc
is regulated by causing the strength of the current and the
length of the arc mutually to control each other. There is no
clock-work or other extraneous power, but the action of the
electric current alone effects the necessary movements. The
electrodes tend to move towards each other at all times, and
this tendency is opposed by the electro-magnetic action, which
tends to separate them. These opposing forces are designed
to be in equilibrium when the electrodes are at such a distance
from each other as will produce the maximum development of
light with a given electric current. It was to an electric arc lamp
of this character that the invention of Brush was to be applied.
The construction of his arrangement, as described in the specification of the reissue, is as follows A helix of insulated wire,
such helix being in the form of a tube or hollow cylinder, rests
upon an insulated plate upheld by a metallic post or standard.
Within the cavity of the helix are contained an iron core and
a rod which passes longitudinally and loosely through and
within the core. This rod holds a carbon. The core is also
made to move very freely within the cavity of the helix, and
is partially supported by means of springs which push upward

BTRUSH v. CONDIT.
Opinion of the Court.

against ears attached to the core.

A ring of metal just below

the core surrounds the carbon-holder, and rests upon a floor or
support. One edge of the ring is over a lifting tongue, which
is attached to the core, while the opposite edge is a short distance below the crown of an adjustable set screw The design
is that one point of the ring may be lifted in such way as to
clamp the carbon-holder, while a limit is placed to the upward
movement of the core. The poles of the battery being so
attached that the circuit of an electric current is completed,
the core, by the force of the axial magnetism, is drawn up
within the cavity of the helix, and by means of the lifting
tongue one edge of the ring is lifted until, by its angular impingement against the rod or carbon-holder, it clamps such
rod, and also lifts it up to a distance limited by an adjustable
stop. While the ring preserves this angular relation with and
impingement against the rod, the rod will be firmly retained
and prevented from moving through the ring. The adjustable
stop is fixed so that it shall arrest the lifting of the rod when
the two carbons are sufficiently separated from each other.
While the electric current is not passing, the rod can slide
readily through the -loose ring and the core, and in this condition gravity will cause the upper carbon to rest upon the
lower carbon, thus bringing the various parts of the device
into the position of a closed circuit. If then a current of electricity is passed through the apparatus, it will instantly operate
to lift the rod, and thus separate the two carbons and produce
the electric light. As the carbons burn away, thus increasing
the length of the voltaic arc, the electric current diminishes in
strength, owing to the increased resistance. This weakens the
magnetism of the helix, and accordingly the core, rod and
upper carbon move downward by the force of gravity until
the consequent shortening of the voltaic are increases the
strength of the current and stops such downward- movement.
After a time, however, the ring will reach its floor or support,
and its downward movement will be arrested. Any further
downward movement of the core, however slight, will at once
release the rod, allowing it to slide through the ring until
arrested by the upward movement of the core, due to the

OCTOBER4 TERM, 1889.
Opimon of the Court.

increased magnetism. In continued operation, the normal
position of the ring is in contact with its lower support, the
office of the core being to regulate the sliding of the rod
through it. If, however, the rod accidentally slides too far,
it will instantly and automatically be raised again as at first,
and the carbon points thus be continued in proper relation to
each other.
Claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 of the reissue, on which alone recovery
is sought, read as follows, there being eight claims in all in
the reissue as granted
"1. In an electric lamp, the combination, with the carbonholder and core, of a clamp surrounding the carbon-holder,
said clamp being independent of the core, but adapted to be
raised by a lifter secured thereto, substantially as set forth."
" 3 . In an electric lamp, the combination of the core or
armature 0, the clamp ID, and adjustable stop Y, or their
equivalents, whereby the points of the carbons are separated
from each other when an electrical current is established prevented from separating so as to break the current - and
gradually fed together as the carbons are consumed, substantially as described."
"5. In an electric lamp, the combination, with a carbonholder, of an annular clamp surrounding the carbon-holder,
said clamp adapted to be moved, and thereby to separate the
carbon points by electrical or magnetic action, substantially
as herein set forth.
"c6. In an electric lamp, an annular clamp adapted to grasp
and move a carbon-holder, substantially as shown."
What is called in these claims "the clamp ID" is the ring of
metal which surrounds the rod or carbon-holder.
The specification of the reissue, as granted, contained the
following paragraph "I do not limit myself narrowly to the
ring ID, as other devices may be employed which would
accomplish the same result. Any device may be used which,
while a current of electricity is not passing through the helix
A, will permit the rod B to move freely up and down, but
which, when a current of electricity is passing through the
.helix, will, by the raising of the core 0, operatedboth to clamp

Opinion of the Court.

and to raise the rod B, and thereby separate the carbon points
F F', and retain them in proper relation to each other."
On the 14th of October, 1881, the plantiffs filed in the Patent Office a disclaimer, in which they stated that the patentee
had claimed more than that of which he was the first inventor
or discoverer, by or in consequence of the use in the specification of the language contained in the paragraph last above
quoted, and that there were material and substantial parts of
the thing patented, also embraced within the terms of the
above quoted paragraph, which were truly and justly the invention of Brush. The paper went on to enter a disclaimer
to that part of the subject matter of the specification and of
claims 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the reissue, which, being embraced
within the general language of the above quoted paragraph,
included as within the invention of Brush "clamping devices
substantially different in construction and mode of operation
from the clamp D."
On the 6th of April, 1883, the plaintiffs filed in the Patent
Office a disclaimer of so much or such part of the invention
described in the reissue, and coming within the general language of the third claim, as might cover or include as elements
thereof "the core or armature 0" and "the clamp D" excepting when the core or armature raises the clamp by a lifter
secured to such core or armature, substantially as described m
the patent. The same paper disclaimed the specific combinations forming the subject matter of clauns 2, 7 and 8.
Judge Shipman held that the first claim describes a clamp
independent of, that is, not fixed to, the core, but adapted to
be raised by a lifter secured to the core, and does not mean
that the clamp is independent of, and not in any way dependent for its motion upon, the core, but is adapted to be raised
by a lifter secured to itself. He further held, that the first
claim does not include the adjustable stop of the third claim,
but includes only the combination of the clamp and core and
rod, with the described elements which are necessary to cause
an angular impingement upon the rod and an intermittent
downward feeding of the rod. He also held that the clamp of
the sixth claim is not any annular clamp adapted to grasp and

move a carbon-holder, but means to describe in general terms
the clamp of the first claim, which raises, clamps and feeds
downwardly the rod, preserving a practically uniform length
of arc by the described means, or an annular clamp surrounding the carbon-holder independently of the core, but adapted
to be raised by a lifter secured to the core and some suitable
agency to allow the clamp to be tripped, and that the fifth
claim includes the clamp of the first and sixth claims, the carbon-holder, the motor, and the tripping device.
Judge Shipman examined the question of the novelty of
Claims 1, 3, 5 and 6, and arrived at the conclusion that they
were invalid by reason of their prior existence as perfected inventions, in a lamp made in June, 1876, by one Hayes, at
Ansonia, Connecticut. On this subject he says in his opimon
"The clamp, in combination with the other necessary elements, which was made by Charles H. Hayes of Ansonia,
Connecticut, and was a part of a lamp which he constructed
about the end of June, 1876, as an improvement upon the
White lamp, is the combination of the first and third claims
of the Brush patent. The carbon rod was square or rectangular, and, therefore, was surrounded by a rectangular clamp
which was independent of the core. It is not denied that this
clamp is the equivalent of an annular clamp. It was raised
by a lifter secured to the core and was tripped by coming in
contact with a floor, while the ascent of the rod was checked
by the contact of the clamp with an adjustable stop.
"The plaintiffs' answer to the anticipatory character of this
clamp is that it was an-abandoned experiment and never was
a perfected invention. The facts in regard to its character
and position as an invention are as follows: Mr. Hayes was,
in 1876, and has been continuously since, in the employ of
Wallace & Sons, who are large manufacturers of brass goods
in Ansonia. In 1876 this firm was trying to find a successful
electric lamp to manufacture. Mr. White furnished them
with his device, which they sent, as a part of their exhibit, to
the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. Mr. Hayes testifies as follows; 'Experiments with the White lamp showed
its defects so stropgly or plainly that I designed this' (the

BRUSHI v. CONDIT.
Opinion of the Court.

Hayes) 'lamp to overcome those defects. I made rough
drawings in the middle or latter part of May, 1876, commenced building the lamp at once, and fimshed it about the
end of June following; tested it, tried it, and made some
minor alterations, and run it from time to time, when a lamp
was needed, until the 16th of September following.' At this
time he was in Philadelphia, and a fellow-employe by the
name of King, thinking that he could improve upon the
clutch and make the feeding of the carbons answer more
promptly to the changes of the current or make the feeding
less 'jerky,' obtained permission from Wallace & Sons, who
owned the clamp, to make an alteration. The 'King clutch,'
constructed upon a different principle from that of the Hayes
or the Brush clamp, was put into the lamp, which has remained in use in the mill, and, since the end of 1876, has been
'used in the electrical room for testing machines, carbons,
&c., and has been used for that purpose more or less ever
since.' But one Hayes lamp was made until a duplicate
specimen was made for use in this case. The Hayes clamp, it
will be observed, was used in the lamp only until September
16th. Prior to that date the use of the lamp with the original clamp is thus described by Mr. Hayes upon cross-examination. 'It' (the lamp) 'was moved about and burned in
different places - in the mill and outside -

and it was also

burned in our other shop occasionally' This shop was known
as the skirt shop, the third floor of which was used for electrical work. The mill and skirt shop were ordinarily lighted
by gas. ' Question. On what occasions did you use the lamp
out-of-doors 9 Aus. The lamp was used out-of-doors on several occasions, when gangs of men required light unloading
freight from railway cars, digging for some work connected
with the water power. I am unable to specify positively
any particular date, but have a general recollection of being
frequently called upon to make a light for some such purposes.
Question. Did you use it sometimes to test dynamos with in
June-September, 1876 9 Ans. I think not during that time.
Question. What other use did you put it to during those
months except the occasions out-of-doors which you have

OCTOBER TERI, 1889.

mentioned? Ans. It was used about the mill, more particularly around the muffie , on occasions when it was necessary
to work during the evening.' The use was a public one in
the presence of the employes of the factory The Hayes
clamp has been preserved and was an exhibit in the case.
Wallace & Sons thereafter, after much experimenting, went,
to a limited extent, into the manufacture of what were known
in the case as 'plate lamps,' or lamps having two carbon
plates instead of rods, but did not continue the business long.
They say that the discontinuance was due to the fact that
they did not have a satisfactory generator. The Hayes
clamp was used upon the plate lamps, but, as has been said,
was used upon but one carbon pencil electric lamp.
"The plaintiffs vigorously insist that the Hayes clamp was
not a completed and successful invention, but that its use was
merely tentative and experimental, and was permanently abandoned because the device did not promise to be successful.
"Two facts are manifest 1st, that the Hayes clamp was
the clamp of the Brush patent and, 2d, that it became, after
September 16th, a disused piece of mechanism m connection
with carbon points. The question then is -- Was it a perfected and publicly known invention, the use of which was
abandoned prior to the date of the Brush invention, or was
its use merely experimental, which ended in an abandoned
experiment on September 16th 2
"The plaintiffs, in support of their view, say that Wallace
& Sons were searching for a successful lamp, and were exhibitors of an electric lamp at the Centennial Exhibition, that
inventors were in their employ, who were encouraged to make
experiments and trials in the hope that something good might
be produced, and, under this stimulus, one Hayes lamp was
made, that improvements in the location of the spring were
made, that it gave a 'jerky' light, and, when the inventor
was away another clamp was put on, by the permission, of the
owners, to remedy this irregular feeding, that afterwards no
other lamp was ever constructed, and the Hayes clutch was
left among other ' odds and ends,' and that the indifference
with which it was received, its confessed faults, the attempted

BRUSH v. CONDIT.
Opinion of the Court.

improvements and its disuse, show that the Hayes clamp
never was anything more than an attempt to invent something which proved to be a failure.
"The question of fact, in this part of the case, must turn
upon the character of the use of the lamp prior to September
16th, because it is established that the Hayes clamp and the
Brush clamp, in its patented features, were substantially alike,
and that the point in which they differ, viz., the length of the
arms, is not a part of the principle of the device. Was the
lamp with this clutch used merely to gratify curiosity, or for
purposes of experiment, to see whether the feeding device was
successful, or whether anything more was to be done to perfect
it, or was it put to use in the ordinary business of the mill, as
a thing which was completed, and was for use, and was neither
upon trial nor for show 2
"Hayes made the lamp for Wallace & Sons as an improvement upon the White lamp, and apparently turned it over to
them to be used when they chose. An alteration was subsequently made in the location of the spring. The lamp was
used at different times, in the work of the mill, at night, mdoors, and out-of-doors. Its use at these times does not seem
to have been for the purpose of testing the machine, or of calling attention to its qualities, or of gratifying curiosity, but it
was used to furnish light to the workmen at their work. I
have queried whether this use was not that of a thing which
ight be of help in an emergency, and which was thought to
be better than nothing, though not of much advantage, but it
was, apparently, used to accomplish the ordinary purposes of
an electric light in a mill, to enable the workmen to see at
night, although it was not uniformly used, because the mill
was lighted by gas.
"But the plaintiffs press the question -Why, then, was the
further use of the Hayes clamp and lamp discontinued?
This question is significant, because the abandonment of a
thing which is greatly wanted is, ordinarily, a very suggestive
circumstance to show that it was defective, and that, before
the invention could be completed, something was to be done
which never was done.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

"I think that Wallace & Sons did not push the electric lamp
business because they had no generator, and I also think that
the Hayes lamp, either with or without the Hayes clutch, did
not impress them favorably, for they contented themselves
with making only one specimen, whereas they made six White
lamps, and, after much experimenting, and after the invention
of the Hayes lamp, they made fifty or sixty plate lamps.
For some reason they did not manufacture the Hayes lamp,
but turned away to the plate lamps. But the facts that the
anticipatory device was the device of the patent, and did do
practical work, and was put to ordinary use, and that it does
not appear that the Hayes clamp was the cause of the neglect
with which Wallace & Sons treated the Hayes lamp, seem to
me to outweigh the doubts which arise from the shortness of
its existence and its permanent disappearance from a carbon
pencil lamp.
"The case is that of the public, well-known, practical use
in ordinary work, with as much success as was reasonable to
expect at that stage in the development of the mechanism
belonging to electric arc lighting, of the exact invention which
was subsequently made by the patentee, and, although only
one clamp and one lamp were ever made, which were used
together two and one-half months only, and the invention was
then taken from the lamp and was not afterwards used with
carbon pencils, it was an anticipation of the patented device,
under the established rules upon the subject. With a strong
disinclination to permit the remains of old experiments to destroy the pecuniary value of a patent for a useful and successful
invention, and remembering that the defendants must assume
a weighty burden of proof, I am of the opinion that the patentee's invention has been clearly proved to have been anticipated by that of Hayes. Coffin v Ogden, 18 Wall. 120, Reed
v Cutter, 1 Story, 590, Pwtceerzng v AXcOullough, 104: U. S.
310, Curtis on Patents, §§ 89-92.
"The bill, so far as it relates to the clamp patent, is dismissed."
We have examined carefully the evidence in this case, relied
upon by the plaintiffs to show that the clamp arrangement of

BRUSH v. CONDIT.
Opinion of the Court.

Hayes was not a perfected invention, but was merely an
abandoned experiment, and we have arrived at the conclusion
that Judge Shipman's views on the subject are correct. They
are well and accurately expressed, and we could not add to
their force by a prolonged discussion of what is purely a question of fact.
The cases of Coffn v Ogden and Psckerzng v .fcCullough,
cited by Judge Shipman, are enforced by the case of flall v.
.'cneale,107 U. S. 90, 97. This latter case meets, also, the
objection made by the appellants that the mechaism of the
Hayes clutch was concealed from view, and the further objection that it would not operate as perfectly as that of the
Brush invention. In Hall v .Macneale,speaking of the anticipating safes, this court said. "The invention was complete in
those safes. It was capable of producing the results sought
to be accomplished, although not as thoroughly as with the
use of welded steel and iron plates. The construction and
arrangement and purpose and mode of operation and use of
the bolts in the safes were necessarily known to the workmen
who put them in. They were, it is true, hidden from view,
after the safes were completed, and it required a destruction
of the safes to bring them into view But this was no concealment of them or use of them m secret. They bad no
more concealment than was inseparable from any legitimate
use of them."
It is contended by the appellants that, notwithstanding the
prior existence of the Hayes apparatus as a perfected mvention, claims 5 and 6 of the reissue are sustainable because each
of them is limited to an "annular clamp." It is urged that
the clamp of the patent is a ring which surrounds a cylindrical
rod, and that the rod in the Hayes apparatus was square or
rectangular, and was surrounded by a rectangular clamp. But.
it is quite apparent that claims 5 and 6 of the reissue would, if
the patent were valid, be infringed by the manufacture and
use of the patented apparatus with a rectangular carbon rod
surrounded by a rectangular clamp. Such an apparatus might
be inferior in perfection and utility to the cylindrical.rod with
the ring clamp, but it would still embody the principle of the
