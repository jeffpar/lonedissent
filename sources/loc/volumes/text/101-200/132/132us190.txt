CHIEF JUSTICE

FULLER delivered the opinion of the

This is an appeal, by plaintiff in the suit, from the decree of
the Circuit Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, dismissing its bill of complaint filed in that court against the
appellees, the Board of Levee Commissioners, and certain
sheriffs and tax-collectors, to enjoin the collection of taxes
levied under an act of the legislature, creating such Board of
Commissioners, for the purpose of providing for the payment
of the principal and interest of bonds authorized to be issued
by the board, the proceeds of which were to be applied to the
construction and repair of levees on the Mississippi River.
The bill set up the same exemption relied on in Yazoo
& ]Mi~szssipp? Valley Railroad Comany v Thomas, ante,
174, and it was insisted that the taxes sought to be collected were unauthorized and illegal by reason of such exemption,, and that the law imposing the taxes impaired the
obligation of the alleged contract of exemption and thus violated the Constitution of the United States, the litigation,

Opinion of the Court.

therefore, making a controversy arising under that Constitution. Without considering whether any other ground for
affirming the decree exists, it is sufficient to say that this
case is disposed of by the decision which has just been announced in that referred to.
Decree affirmed.

GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.

In this action, tried by the Circuit Court without a jury,
there is no case stated by the parties, or finding of facts by
the court. The bill of exceptions, after setting forth all the
evidence introduced at the trial, states that "there were no
declarations of law asked for, or given by the court," and
the single exception taken is to the overruling of a motion for
a new trial, which is a matter of discretion, and not a subject
of exception, according to the practice of the courts of the
United States. In regard to motions for a new trial, and bills
of exceptions, those courts are independent of any statute or
practice prevailing in the courts of the State in which the
