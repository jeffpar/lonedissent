that property
Five thousand dollars of the money first
raised on these notes went immediately to pay a prior incumbrance in the nature of a vendor's lien on the property
mortgaged. The remaining notes were handed to Mr. Torrey,
the partner of Gomila in the firm of Gomila & Co., and he
raised the sums due to Gurley by delivering to him part of the
notes. He also raised money from certain banks by delivering some of the notes as security for the indebtedness of
Gomila & Co. These notes he redeemed, and ultimately
turned them over to Barker as security for the loans advanced
by him for the benefit of the firm of Gomila & Co. It i distinctly denied by A. J Gomila that, after he delivered these
notes to Torrey to be used for the benefit of Gomila & Co.,
they ever came back to his possession or under his personal
control, and no evidence of that fact is produced, nor are we
aware that, if such had been the case, it would impair the
rights of their present holders, who received them in the regular course of business, paying a valuable consideration for
them before their maturity It is idle to pursue the subject
further. A recital in this opinion of the testimony of each
witness examined could lead to no useful results. That -Mr.
Gomila covered his homestead with a mortgage, which was
used to raise money by the firm of which he was a member
to pay its debts, is surely not a transaction that should be
branded as a fraud.
The decree of the Circuit Court is
Affirmed.

a different State from the plaintiff, removed the entire cause into a Circuit

On the 1st of March, 1883, Chester C. Corbin filed a bill in
equity in the Circuit Court of Cook County, in the State of
Illinois, against William A. Boies, Benjamin B. Fay, Lucius
W Conkey and Julius K. Graves, who had composed the
limited partnership of Boies, Fay & Conkey, in which Graves
was the special partner and the three others were the general
partners, the partnership being formed under a statute of
Illinois, and doing business in Chicago, as wholesale grocers
and importers.

The First National Bank of Chicago, Illinois,

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

Alvin F Shumway, The Bay State Sugar Refining Company
of Massachusetts, The First National Bank of Westboro', Massachusetts, Walter Potter, James M. Flower, Curtis HI. Remy
and Stephen S. Gregory, the last three being a firm of attorneys-at-law, under the name of Flower, Remy & Gregory,
Seth F Hanchett, sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, and twentyone other persons and corporations were also made defendants
to the bill.
The bill set out that the plaintiff was the creditor of the
said limited partnership, as being the owner of two promissory
notes made and endorsed by it, and made the following averments The limited partnership carried on business at Chicago
from March, 1882, until January, 1883, and contracted debts
during that time amounting to about $400,000. On the 13th
of January, 1883, its assets were insufficient to pay more than
about 50 cents on the dollar of its liabilities, and during the
time named it borrowed large sums of money, by loans and
discounts of commercial paper made by it. On or about
December 2, 1882, the members of the partnership, knowing
it to be insolvent, and with the intent to hinder, delay and
defraud such of its creditors as they did not see fit to prefer,
and in contemplation of its insolvency, and with the intent to
prefer certain of their creditors, or pretended creditors, and to
evade the provisions of the statute of Illinois, pretended to dissolve the partnership, and recorded in the office of the county
clerk of Cook County a paper purporting to be a dissolution
of it, but the paper was a mere device contrived by them to
evade the provisions of the statute, and to give color of validity to the acts of Fay and Conkey, thereinafter set forth, in
executing the judgment notes, warrants of attorney, and
confessions of judgment thereinafter described. After the
pretended dissolution Fay and Conkey pretended to carry on
the business under the firm name of "Fay & Conkey," and
assumed to be the owners of all the assets of the limited partnership. Boies and Graves pretended to release and convey
to Fay and Conkey all their interest in such assets, but such
release was void as against the creditors of the limited partnership. By the statute of Illinois, under which the partnership

Opinion of the Court.

was formed, all of its assets were pledged to the payment of
its debts ratably, and it was the duty of the four partners,
when they first had knowledge of its insolvency, or at the
time of its pretended dissolution, to appoint a trustee to take
charge of its assets and convert them into money and distribute the same ratably among its creditors. Fay and Conkey, on or about the 22d of January, 1883, in pursuance of
said fraudulent scheme, executed in favor of six of the defendants seven promissory notes, payable on demand, with
warrants of attorney annexed to confess judgment for such
amount as might appear to be unpaid thereon, with costs and
five per cent attorneys' fees, the notes amounting to $91,353.18,
of which one note, for $40,000, was in favor of the First National Bank of Chicago, and one note, for $17,500, was in
favor of the defendant Graves. On the 22d of January, 1883,
judgments were entered in the Superior Court of Cook County,
Illinois, against Fay and Conkey upon each of the seven notes,
together with the costs and five per cent attorneys' fees, in
favor of the six defendants mentioned, there being seven judgments in all, amounting in the aggregate to $95,965.83, of
which one judgment was in favor of the First National Bank
of Chicago, for $42,000, and one in favor of Graves, for $18,375.
On or about the 22d of January, 1883, Fay and Conkey, in
further pursuance of said fraudulent scheme, executed in favor
of fifteen of the defendants fifteen promissory notes, payable
on demand, with warrants of attorney to confess judgment
annexed, amounting in the aggregate to $120,999.61, of which
one note, for $27,000, was made in favor of Graves, one for
$6990 in favor of Shumway, one for $10,000 in favor of The
Bay State Sugar Refining Company of Massachusetts, one for
$12,000 in favor of the First National Bank of Westboro',
Massachusetts, and one for $4300 in favor of Potter. On
the 22d of January, 1883, or between that day and the 26th
of January, 1883, inclusive, there were entered in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois
judgments against Fay and Conkey upon each of the last
named fifteen notes, in pursuance of said warrants of attorney,
together with the costs and five per cent attorneys' fees, in

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

favor of fifteen of the defendants, amounting in the aggregate
to $127,014.61, of which judgments one was in favor. of Graves
for $28,350, one in favor of Shumway for $7339.50, one in
favor of The Bay State Sugar Refining Company for $10,500,
one in favor of the First National Bank of Westboro', Mlassachusetts, for $12,600, and one in favor of Potter for $4515.
On or about the 22d of January, 1883, and immediately after
the entry of the judgments in the Superior Court of Cook
County, the defendants Flower, lemy and Gregory, as attorneys for the defendants Boies, Fay, Conkey and Graves, and
as attorneys of record for the respective plaintiffs in those
judgments, caused execution to be issued on each of them
against the property of Fay and Conkey, to the sheriff of Cook
County, who, by direction of the attorneys, seized and levied
on a large quantity of merchandise, of the value of about
$75,000, part of the assets of the limited partnership. The
levy and seizure were made in further pursuance of said
fraudulent scheme, and with intent to delay, hinder and
defraud the plaintiff and other creditors of the limited partnership, and to give a preference to each of the defendants in
whose favor the judgments were entered. The sheriff has sold
the property seized, with the exception of about $12,000
worth which was replevied, and has in lhs possession about
$54,000 as the proceeds of said sales. Immediately after four
of the judgments in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the Northern District of Illinois were entered, namely, that
in favor of the Commercial National Bank of Dubuque, Iowa,
for $14,962.50, that in favor of Graves for $28,350, that in
favor of the Dubuque County Bank of Dubuque, Iowa, for
$12,495, and that in favor of the Importers' and Traders'
National Bank of New York City for $16,800, the defendants
Flower, Remy and Gregory, on the 22d of January, 1883, as
the attorneys of Boles, Fay, Coukey and Graves, and as the
attorneys of the plaintiffs in those four judgments, caused execution to be issued on each of them, directed to the marshal
of the district, against the property of Fay and Conkey The
marshal, on the same day, returned those executions nulla
bona. Thereupon, Flower, Remy and Gregory, as attorneys

for the plaintiffs in those four judg ments, filed a creditors'
bill in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern

District of Illinois, alleging divers frauds on the part of Fay
and Conkey, and praying for the appointment of a receiver.
That court appointed as receiver the defendant Hancock, a
brother-in-law of Flower, and the books of account and
assets of the limited partnership were delivered to hun by Fay

and Conkey, and he has possession of them, and is collecting
them, the drafts, notes, accounts and choses in action amounting to more than $210,000. Immediately after the entry of
the judgments in the Circuit Court of the United States in
favor of seven of the defendants, including Shumway, The
Bay State Sugar Refimng Company, the First National Bank
of Westboro', and Potter, Flower, :Remy and Gregory, as
attorneys of Boies, Fay, Conkey and Graves, and as attorneys
for the plaintiffs in said seven judgments, caused executions to
be issued upon them to the marshal, against the property of
Fay and Conkey The marshal returned them nulla bona,
and thereupon Flower, Remy and Gregory, as such attorneys
and on behalf of the plaintiffs in the seven judgnents, filed a
creditors' bill in the said Circuit Court of the United States,
alleging that Fay and Conkey had concealed their property,
and praying the appointment of a receiver. Rancock was
appointed such receiver, or his first receivership was extended.
The judgments in the Circuit Court of the United States were
rendered in pursuance of the said fraudulent scheme on the
part of Boies, Fay, Conkey and Graves. Upon the entry of
each of the judgments before mentioned, there was added to
and included therein a sum equal to five per cent of the original demand on which the judgment was rendered, as attorneys' fees for the entry thereof, the aggregate amount of such
attorneys' fees being $10,657.65. That amount was an excessive charge for the service, and was charged for the purpose
of absorbing to that extent the assets of the limited partnership, and Fay and Conkey are interested therein, and have
some secret agreement with said attorneys for a division of
that sum. Flower, Remy and Gregory are and have been
the attorneys of Boies, Fay, Conkey and Graves, and are the

attorneys of Hancock, receiver.

The plaintiff has applied to

Hancock, receiver, for an examination of the books of the
limited partnership, for the purpose of ascertaining what
settlement, if any, Boies, Fay and Conkey had made with
Graves, or what settlement Fay and Conkey had made with
Boles, but Hancock refused such examination, and said that
such refusal was in accordance with directions given him by
Flower, Remy and Gregory, as his attorneys. The judgments
so entered on confession are, or some one or more of them is
or are, fictitious, and rendered for more than was due to the
plaintiffs therein respectively, and this excess is alleged to
exist in regard to twenty-two of the judgments, including the
two in favor of Graves and those in favor of the First National
Bank of Chicago, Shumway, The Bay State Sugar Refining
Company, the First National Bank of Westboro', Massachusetts and Potter. Fay and Conkey, at the time the notes
and warrants of attorney were made and the judgments were
entered, knew that the limited partnership was insolvent,
and they executed the notes and warrants, and confessed the
judgments, with the intention of paying and securing to each
of the persons in whose favor the notes and warrants were
executed and the judgments were confessed a preference over
any other creditors of the limited partnership. The confessions were unlawful acts, prohibited by the statute of Illinois,
and the judgments, and all acts done in pursuance thereof,
and all process issued thereon, and all acts done under such
process, are void. None of the persons or firms in whose'
favor the notes were given knew of the execution of them
until after judgment had been entered thereon, and all of the
judgments were entered without the knowledge or consent of
the persons mentioned as plaintiffs therein. None of the,
notes were made in the ordinary course of business, but they
were all made with intent on the part of Fay and Conkey to
carry out the said fraudulent scheme, and all of the judgments were entered by Flower, Remy and Gregory, by direction of Fay and Conkey or of Fay The property so taken

tute the whole of the assets of the limited partnership, and
its bona fide debts amount to about $400,000.
The bill waives answers on oath, and prays for a decree that
the pretended transfer of the assets of the limited partnership
to Fay and Conkey was fraudulent and void, that each of the
judgments so entered on confession, the executions issued and
the proceedings thereon, or on their return, and everything
done under the judgments and executions, or in any suit based
on any of the judgments, and every sale or transfer involving
any of them, be declared void, that it be decreed that all of
the goods levied upon under the executions, and the assets
taken possession of by Hancock as receiver, are the property
of the limited partnership, and as such subject to the lien, and
charged with the payment, of the debt due to the plaintiff,
and all other debts owed by the limited partnership, ratably,
that each of the defendants be decreed to pay to the receiver
to be appointed in this suit whatever money they have received by virtue of their respective judgments or any suit
based thereon, out of said property, that such money and all
moneys realized by such receiver from the assets of the limited
partnership be paid to its creditors ratably, that such receiver
be appointed to convert the property into money and distribute
it, that the defendants Flower, Remy, Gregory and the
sheriff be temporarily enjoined from paying over to any person any proceeds of the property of the limited partnership,
which they now have or may hereafter receive under any of
said judgments, executions or creditors' bills, and that such
injunction be made perpetual on a hearing.
Boes, Fay, Conkey, the First National Bank of Chicago,
Flower, Remy and Gregory, the sheriff of Cook County and
four others of the defendants, were served with a summons.
Flower, Remy and Gregory entered an appearance in the suit
for Boies, Fay and Conkey on the 21st of MVIarch, 1883, and on
the 2d of April, 1883, also entered an appearance for themselves, the sheriff of Cook County and two others of the
defendants.

served on the solicitors for the plaintiff a notice that, on the
4th of April, 1883, they would present to the Circuit Court of
Cook County a petition and bond, on behalf of that bank, for
the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Northern District of Illinois, and ask for an
order removing the cause.
The petition and bond were presented, both of them dated
April 2, 1883. The petition was sworn to by the defendant
Flower, one of the firm of Flower, Remy & Gregory, who also
executed the bond as surety The petition is made by the
First National Bank of Chicago, Illinois, and is entitled in the
suit, naming as defendants those against whom the bill prays
process. It states "that the controversy in said suit is between citizens of different States, and that your petitioner was
at the time of the commencement of this suit and still is a
citizen of the State of Illinois, that Chester C. Corbin, the
complainant, was then and still is a citizen of the State of
Massachusetts," that twelve of the defendants "were then
and still are citizens of the State of Illinois," that four of
them "were then and still are citizens of the State of Iowa,"
that one of them was then and still is a citizen of the State of
New York; one, of the State of Ohio, two, of the State of
Michigan, three, of the State of Wisconsin, one, of the'State
of Colorado, "that the defendants, The Bay State Sugar Refining Company, the First National Bank of Westboro', Alvin
F Shumway and Walter Potter, were then and still are citizens of the State of Massachusetts;" and that "in the said
suit above mentioned there is a controversy which is wholly
between citizens of different States, and which can be fully
determined as between them, to wit, a controversy between
the said petitioner, who is a citizen of the State of Illinois, and
the said complainant, Chester C. Corbin, who is a citizen of the
State of Massachusetts."
No order appears to have been made by the state court on
the presentation of the petition and bond, but the clerk of
that court on the 9th of April, 1883, signed a certificate under
its seal to a transcript of the record in that court, which was
filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the North-

ern District of Illinois on the 11th of April, 1883, and the
cause has since proceeded m the latter court.
The cause was put at issue, proofs were taken by the respective parties, and, on the 17th of November, 1885, a decree was
made by the court, finding as facts that on or about the 20th
of August, 1882, the limited partnership composed of Boles,
Fay, Conkey and Graves was insolvent, and so continued to
the termination of its business, with the knowledge of each of
the members thereof, that, with such knowledge, such members continued to do business until the 22d of January, 1883,
when Fay and Conkey, assuming to be successors of Boies,
Fay & Conkey, confessed seven judgments in the Superior
Court of Cook County, one of them in favor of the First
National Bank of Chicago and one m favor of Graves, and
fifteen judgments in the said Circuit Court of the United
States, one of them in favor of Graves, one in favor of The
Bay State Sugar Refining Company, one in favor of Shumway, one in favor of the First National Bank of Westboro',
Massachusetts, and one in favor of Potter, that the members
composing the limited partnership of Boies, Fay & Conkey
went through the form of a dissolution thereof, for the purpose of defeating the statute of Illinois winch prohibited insolvent limited partnerships from preferring creditors, and to defraud a part of their creditors, that such partnership was still
subsisting at the time of the confession and entry of each of
the judgments, that the judgments were confessed to prefe,
certain creditors, but chiefly to save Graves from loss on account of said partnership or on account of liabilities incurred
by him on commercial paper made by or on behalf of it, that
immediately after the judgments were entered in the Superior
Court of Cook County, Graves and Fay caused executions to be
issued thereon to the sheriff of that county, who levied them
on all the stock in trade and merchandise of the limited partnership and sold the property at public sale, and with its proceeds, on February 26, 1883, paid to the First National Bank
of Chicago, on its judgment; $40,000, and on the same day
paid to Graves, on his judgment in the Superior Court of
Cook County, $9791.18,

and Gregory were employed as counsel by the limited partnership, and by Graves on his own behalf, to enter the judgments
by confession, and to advise and represent the said firm and
Graves in and about all matters and things affecting it and
Graves, and received from them $2500 for services rendered
and to be rendered in that behalf, that each of the judgments
was confessed for the full amount due the several preferred
creditors, and in some cases for more than was due, and for five
per cent in addition thereto for attorneys' fees, which latter
amount was intended as a provision for Flower, Remy and
Gregory out of the assets of the limited partnership, and that
they received without right, out of such assets, on account of
attorneys' fees, $8559.80.
The decree further found that Fay and Conkey had each
taken from the assets of the firm, and fraudulently appropriated to his own use, certain specified sums of money, that
Graves had, on the 21st and 22d days of January, 1883, fraudulently appropriated to his own use drafts and checks belonging to the limited partnership, amounting to $2741.38, that
on the 22d and 23d days of January, 1883, and after the levy
of the executions aforesaid, Flower, Remy and Gregory collected drafts and checks belonging to the limited partnership,
amounting to $1927.96, which they still held, that the judgments in favor of the Dubuque County Bank, the Commercial National Bank and the Importers' and Traders' National
Bank were confessed at the special instance of Graves; that
the judgment in favor of the Commerial National Bank was
not an indebtedness due from the limited partnership to the
bank, that Graves owes that partnership a sum equal to its
assets which had been applied by his direction in payment
of the last-named three judgments, that in a creditors' suit
brought by Graves and the last-named three banks against
Fay and Conkey, Hancock as receiver, and with the funds
in his hands as such, paid to said three banks in the
aggregate $41,525.59, and to Graves, on his judgment in

the Circuit Court of the United States, $27,232.50, that in a
certain other suit by creditors' bill in said Circuit Court of
the United States, wherein The Bay State Sugar Refining

Company, Shumway, the First National Bank of Westboro',
Massachusetts, Potter and three other persons were plaintiffs,
and Fay and Conkey were defendants, and in which also Hancock was receiver, he paid, out of the assets in his hands as
such receiver, to The Bay State Sugar Refining Company, on
its judgment, $2000, to that company on the judgment in
favor of Shumway, $1398, to the First National Bank of
Westboro', on its judgment, $2400, to Potter, on his judgment, $860, and to the other three persons $2060 in all, that
the two creditors' bills above named, one brought by the Commercial National Bank and others, and the second brought by
The Bay State Sugar Refining Company and others, were each
brought and prosecuted with the intention of defrauding the
creditors of the limited partnership of their just rights; that
Fay and Conkey consented to the filing of said bills and the
appointment of a receiver thereunder, and that the limited
partnership was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of
$4359.31.
The decree then proceeded to adjudge that all the property
and effects held by the limited partnership on the 20th of
August, 1882, and subsequently thereto, and when the judgments were confessed, were a special trust fund for the paymeat of the firm debts ratably among its creditors, that
Graves pay to the clerk of the court within thirty days, for
the benefit of the plaintiff and such other creditors of the
limited partnership as should prove their right to share in the
distribution of the assets of the firm, $100,796.71, with interest, that Flower, Remy and Gregory in like manner pay to
the clerk of the court $9886.57, that Fay and Conkey pay
in like manner $2128.92, that execution issue against the
property of such defendants respectively, in case of non-payment, referring it to a master to take proof of the debts of
the creditors of the limited partnership, charging Graves,
Fay and Conkey with the costs of the cause, and reserving
all matters not decreed upon, including the right to decree
against the creditors in whose favor the judgments were confessed, with leave to the plaintiff to apply for such further
order as might be necessary in relation to any matter not
finally determined by that decree.

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

Graves and Flower, Remy and Gregory prayed separate
appeals to this court, which were allowed. The appeal of
Flower, iRemy and Gregory was afterwards dismissed while
it was pending in this court.
On the 23d of January, 1888, the plaintiff and other creditors of the limited partnership, having proved their claims
before the master to the amount of $125,737.34, (and the
master having reported in favor of said claims on the 9th of
July, 1886,) filed a petition in the cause, stating that Graves
had failed to pay any part of the amount decreed against hun,
that but very little more had been realized under the decree of
November 17, 1885, than sufficient to pay the costs, expenses
and solicitors' fees incurred in the suit, and that the petitioners
insisted that, under the proofs already taken, they were entitled to a decree against the First National Bank of Chicago
for $50,000. They therefore prayed for a decree against that
bank, requiring it to pay, within thirty days, to the receiver
in the cause, $50,000, with interest at six per cent per annum
from March 1, 1883.
On the 23d of April, 1888, the Circuit Court, held by Judge
Gresham, delivered an opinion, (34: Fed. Rep. 692,) in which it
recited the grounds on which the decree of November 17,
1885, had been made, and ordered a decree against the First
National Bank of Chicago.
The decree was entered on the 3d of May, 1888. It found
that on the judgment for $40,000 in favor of the bank,
confessed by Fay and Conkey as successors of the limited
partnership, on January 22, 1883, the bank had, on or about
February 26, 1883, received out of the sale of the assets of
that partnership by the sheriff, on an execution in its favor,
$38,708.35, that at the time of the pretended dissolution of
the partnership, in October, 1882, and on the 2d of December,
1882, and later, the bank knew that such partnership was insolvent and unable to pay all its creditors, and knew that the
contract for its dissolution was a pretended one and entered
into for the purpose of protecting Graves from liability as
special partner and as endorser for the firm, that the bank
co-operated with the members of the partnership tor the accom-

Opinion of the Court.

plishment of such purpose, and that the judgment was confessed for that purpose, and to obtain an illegal preference over
other creditors. It decreed that the bank pay to the receiver
within thirty days the sum so received, with mterest at six per
cent from February 26, 1883, amounting in all to $50,721.95,
and that, if it were not paid, execution should issue against
the property of the bank.
The bank prayed an appeal to this court. The record on
the appeal of Graves was filed in this court- October 11, 1886,.
and the record on the appeal of the bank was filed October 17,,
1888.
Both of the appeals have been argued in full on the merits.
But the preliminary question arises as to the jurisdiction of the:
Circuit Court in the case, by virtue of the removal of the
cause from the state court on the petition of the bank, and
the point is taken by the respective appellants that the Circuit Court acquired no jurisdiction, because at the time of the
commencement of the suit and at the time -of its removal, as
appears by the petition for removal, the plaintiff and four of
the defendants, namely Shumway, Potter, The Bay State
Sugar Refining Company and the First National Bank of
Westboro', were all of them citizens of Massachusetts. The
determination of this question must depend upon whether, at
the time of the commencement of the suit, there was a separable controversy between the plaintiff and the petitioner for
removal, the First National Bank of Chicago. If there was
but a single controversy in the entire cause, of course there
could be no separable controversy between the plaintiff and
the bank.
By section 2 of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat.
470, under which the removal took place, it was provided
that when, in any suit mentioned in the section, "there shall
be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different
States, and which can be fully determined as between them,
then either one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants actually
interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the
Circuit Court of the United States for the proper district."
The petition for removal states that in the suit "there is a

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

controversy which is wholly between citizens of different
States, and which can be fully determined as between them,"
namely, a controversy between the plaintiff and the bank.
But we are of opinion that there was in the suit but a single
controversy, and that that controversy was not wholly between
citizens of different States. There were various branches of
the controversy, various defendants and various claims by the
several defendants, but the controversy was between the
plaintiff on the one side, and the defendants who were alleged
by the bill to have claims adversely to the plaintiff against the
property of the limited partnership, as a whole, on the other
side.
The case as made by the bill, and as it stood at the time of
the petition for removal, is the test of the right to removal.
The bill was filed to reach the entire property of the limited
partnership. In order to do that, it was necessary to sweep
away not some but all of the confessed judgments and all the
rights obtained by executions and levies thereunder, and to
restore to the assets and moneys of the partnership in the
hands of the court the assets and moneys which had been
fraudulently diverted therefrom by the members of the partnership, with the co-operation of the various defendants. The
bill states that promissory notes were given in favor of the
four defendants who were citizens of Massachusetts, that
judgments on confession, in pursuance of warrants of attorney,
were rendered in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the iNorthern District of Illinois, against Fay and Conkey, in
favor of the four Massachusetts defendants, that, immediately
after the entry of those judgments, Flower, Remy and Gregory,
as the attorneys of the members of the limited partnership,
and as the attorneys of record for the plaintiffs in those
judgments, caused executions to be issued thereon to the
marshal of the district, against the property of Fay and
Conkey, that the same -were returned nlla bonc, that,
thereupon, Flower, Remy and Gregory, as such attorneys,
and on behalf of the plaintiffs in said four judgments and in
three others, fied a creditors' bill in the Circuit Court of the
United States, to reach the property of Fay and Conkey, in

which suit a receiver was appointed, that the said four judgments were entered in pursuance of the fraudulent scheme
alleged in the bill, on the part of the members of the limited
partnership, to hinder, delay and defraud its creditors, and
evade the provisions of the statute of Illinois, and to prefer
the plaintiffs in those several judgments over other creditors,
that the four judgments in favor of the citizens of Mlassachusetts were largely in excess of the amount due to them respectively at the time of the entry of the judgments, and that
those judgments are void. It prays for a decree declaring the
four judgments to be void, and directing the payment to the
receiver of all moneys received by such four defendants under
the judgments or under any proceedings based thereon. These
allegations, with the others contained in the bill, made but a
single controversy, as to all of the defendants. The relief
asked could not have been granted unless all who were made
defendants were parties. Therefore, all of them were necessary parties.
In Bri nkerhoff v Brown, 6 Johns. Oh. 139, it was held that
a creditors' bill could be filed against several persons relative
to matters of the same nature, forming a connected series of
acts, all intended to defraud and injure the plaintiffs, and in
which all the defendants were more or less concerned, though
not jointly in each act. The case there arose on a demurrer to
the bill. It was urged that the bill was multifarious in uniting all the defendants and distinct and unconnected matters.
Fraud was charged against the five trustees of the Genesee
Company, in confessing judgments and causing the property of
the company to be sold. There was a charge of a combined
fraud, affecting seven of the defendants, two of whom were not
concerned in every part of the fraudulent conduct. All the acts
sought to be impeached were alleged to have been done with
a fraudulent intent as respected creditors. The court says
"There was a series of acts on the part of the persons concerned in this Genesee Company, all produced by the same
fraudulent intent and terminating in the deception and injury
of the plaintiffs. The defendants performed different parts in
the same drama, but it was still one piece -one entire per-

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

formance, marked by different scenes; and the question now
occurs, whether the several matters charged are so distinct and
unconnected as to render the joining of them in one bill a
ground of demurrer." The court then reviews the leading cases
on the subject, and says that the principle to be deduced from
them is, "that a bill against several persons must relate to matters of the same nature and having a connection with each
other, and in which all the defendants are more or less concerned,
though their rights in respect to the general subject of the case
may be distinct," that the general right claimed by the bill
was a due application of the capital of the company to the
payment of the judgments of the plaintiffs, that the subject
of the bill and of the relief, and the only matter m litigation,
was the fraud charged in the creation, management and disposition of the capital of the company, that in that charge all the
defendants were implicated, though in different degrees and
proportions, and that the case fell within the reach of the
principle stated, and the demurrer could not be sustained.

The principle above stated has been applied by this court, in
considering the question of removal, in cases like the present.
In Ayers v C/hcago, 101 U. S. 181, a bill was filed in a state
court of Illinois, by the city of Chicago against citizens of
Illinois, to enforce a deed of trust. A citizen of Alabama,
having a judgment against one of the defendants, and claiming a lien on the property covered by the deed of trust, was
admitted as a party defendant to the suit, and filed a cross-bill
to enforce such lien, and removed the suit into the Federal
Court, on the ground that in the original suit there was a controversy wholly between him and the original plaintiff, and
that in the cross-suit the controversy was wholly between citizens of different States. The cause was remanded, and on appeal this court affirmed that decision, saying that the original
bill and the cross-bill constituted one suit, that the intervener

was allowed to take part in a controversy between the city
and the debtor, that he had no dispute with the debtor, and
none separably with the city, that he and the debtor had a
controversy with the city as to its lien on the property, that
the debtor, who was on the same side of the controversy with
him, was a citizen of the same State with the city; and that,
such being the case, the suit was not removable.
In Fidelity Ins. Co. v RHuntngto, 117 U. S. 280, it was
held that a creditors' bill to subject mcumbered property to
the payment of the judgment of the creditor, by selling it and
distributing its proceeds among lien-holders according to priority, created no separate controversy as to the separate lienholders, parties defendant, within the meamng of the removal
act, although their respective defences might be separate.
The court said "The suit as brought by Huntington is a
creditor's bill to subject incumbered property to the payment
of his judgment, by a sale and distribution of the proceeds
among lien-holders according to their respective priorities.
There is but a single cause of action, and that is the equitable
execution of a judgment against the property of the judgment
debtor. This cause of action is not divisible. Each of the
defendants may have a separate defence to the action, but we
have held many times that separate defences do not create
separate controversies within the meaning of the removal act.

Starm v New York, 115 U. S.248, and Sloane v Anderson,
117 U. S. 275. The judgment sought against the Fidelity
Company is incident to the main purpose of the suit, and the
fact that this incident relates alone to this company does not
separate this part of the controversy from the rest of the
action. What Huntington wants is not partial relief, settling
his rights in the property as against the Fidelity Company
alone, but a complete decree, which will give him a sale of the
entire property, free of all incumbrances, and a division of the
proceeds as the adjusted equities of each and all the parties
shall require. The answer of this company shows the questions that will arise under this branch of the one controversy,

which Huntington seeks reqmres the presence of all the
defendants, and the settlement, not of one only, but of all the
branches of the case."

v Parke'?s Adminstrator, ante, 267. The transcript of the
record from the state court in the present case was -filed in
the Circuit Court of the United States on the 11th of April,
1883. The decisions of this court above cited were all but one
of them made at and after October term, 1881.
There is nothing in the record before us which shows that
the question of the removability of the present case, on the
petition for removal which was filed, was raised in the Circuit
Court, either at the time the transcript from the state court
was presented to be filed, or afterwards by a motion to remand,
except what may be inferred from a statement in the record
in the Graves case, at the conclusion of the testimony of a
witness taken April 6, 1883, that the counsel for the plaintiff
stated that he had been before Judge Drummond, in the
United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and the judge had taken jurisdiction of the cause under
the petition for removal by the First National Bank of
Chicago. We find reported, however, the case of Corbzn v
Botes, 18 Fed. Rep. 3, the present case, where Judge Drummond, in an opinion which appears to have been given on an
application to order the transcript from the state court to be
filed in the Circuit Court and the case to be docketed in the
latter court, held that there was in the case a controversy
which was wholly between the plaintiff and the First National
Bank of Chicago, namely, a controversy as to whether the
judgment in favor of that bank was a valid judgment as
against the limited partnership, and the plaintiff as one of its
creditors, and that the bank was not interested in any contro-

versy which the plaintiff might have with other creditors
of the firm. But, as already shown, this view was erroneous
Under the provision of section 5 of the act of March 3, 1875,
18 Stat. 472, that if, in any suit removed from a state court
to a Circuit Court of the United States, it shall appear to the
satisfaction of said Circuit Court, af any time after such suit
has been removed thereto, that it does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the
jurisdiction of said Circuit Court, it shall proceed no further
therein, but shall remand the suit to the court from which
it was removed, as justice may require, this court has held
that when it appears to this court that the case is one of
which, under that provision, the Circuit Court should not have
taken jurisdiction, it is the duty of this court to reverse any
judgment given below, and remand the cause with costs against
the party who wrongfully invoked the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Williams v 2Vottawva, 104 U S. 209. This rule
has been recognized by this court to the extent even of taking
notice of the want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, although
the point has not been formally raised in that court or in this
court, in Turner v Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 106 U S.
552, 555, .Mansfield &c. Railroad v Swan, 111 U. S. 379,

Bridge Co. v. Otoe Co., 120 U. S. 225, 226.
In Stevens v. Nicwls, 130 U. S. 230, it was held that if a
proper diversity of citizenship does not appear by the record to
have existed both at the commencement of the suit and at the
time of filing the petition for removal, this court will remand
the cause to the Circuit Court with directions to send it back
to the state court, with costs against the party at whose instance the removal was made. This same principle was
asserted in Cre/ore v Ohio & fissss?,ppp Railroad,131 U. S.
240, where it was also held that where a suit is entered upon
the docket of a Circuit Court as removed on the ground of the
diverse citizenship of the parties, and was never in law removed,
no amendment of the record made in the Circuit Court can
affect the jurisdiction of the state court, or put the case rightfully on the docket of the Circuit Court as of the date when it
was so docketed.

GRAVES v. CORBIN.
Opinion of the Court.

This same rule was applied at the present term, in Jackson v
Allen, ante, 27, where the judgment of the Circuit Court
was reversed at the cost of the parties who attempted to remove the cause, and it was remitted to the Circuit Court with
directions to remand it to the state court.
There is nothing in the foregoing views which involves the
decision of this court in Barney v -Latham, 103 U S. 205,
which was to the effect that where in a case there was in fact
an entirely separate controversy between the plaintiffs and
several defendants petitioning for removal, with which controversy another defendant, a citizen of the same State with one
of the plaintiffs, had no necessary connection, and which controversy could be fully determined as between the parties
actually interested in it, without the presence as a party in the
cause of such other defendant, not only could there be a removal, but the removal carried with it into the Federal Court
all the controversies in the suit between all parties to it.
It is suggested that it is a hardship to the plaintiff to reverse
his decrees for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court after
he has prosecuted his suit in that court successfully, on his
being taken into that court adversely more than six years ago.
The answer is that the jurisdiction of this court in the present
case to review the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court could only arise on the hearing of an appeal from a final
decree of the latter court, because by ยง 5 of the act of March
3, 1875, 18 Stat. 472, this court was authorized to review
only an order of the Circuit Court remanding a cause, and not
one retaining jurisdiction over it. Even that provision was repealed by ยง 6 of the act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 555, and
this court can now review a question as to the jurisdiction of
a Circuit Court only in reviewing a final judgment or decree,
although by the act of February 25, 18S9, 25 Stat. 693, it
may do so in a case not involving over $5000.
It results from the foregoing considerationsthat both of the
decrees of the Circudt Court,as well that against Graves as
that against the First Vational Bank of Chcago, must be
reversed, and the case be remanded to the Circuit Court
with a direction to remand tt to the Circuzt Court of Cook
