insupport of the bar of a possession under these statutes of
limitations, it is of no avail if it can be seen upon its face and
by its own terms that-it is absolutely void. We are satisfied,
therefore, that in regard to the defence under both statutes of
limitation, the declarations of law by the court were erroneous,
and for that reason its judgment is

STATES

FOR

THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 97. Argued November 12, 13, 1889.-

Decided December 2, 1889.

Dyes or colors called naphthylamine red, orange II, orange IV and resorcme red 3, imported in 1879, were liable to a duty of fifty cents per pound
and thirty-five per cent ad valorem under the provision of schedule M of
ยง 2504 of the Revised Statutes, 2d ed. p. 479, imposing that rate of duty on
"Paints and dyes -aniline dyes and colors, by whatever name known,"
although none of them were known in commerce before 1875, if, according to the understanding of commercial men, dealers in and importers of
them, they would, when imported, be included in the class of articles
known as aniline dyes, by whatever name they had come to be known;
or if, under ยง 2499 of the Revised Statutes, they bore a similitude, either
in material, quality, or the use to which they might be applied, to what
were known as aniline dyes at the time the Revised Statutes were enacted,
in 1874.

This is an action at law, brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Southern District of -New York, by

PICKHARDT v. MERRITT.
Opinion of the Court.

Wilhelm Pickhardt and Adolf Kuttroff against Edwin A.
Merritt, collector of the port of :New York, to recover duties
paid under protest on importations into that port from Hamburg, the entries having been made at the custom-house in
January and February, 1879. There were proper protests and
appeals to the Secretary of the Treasury, and decisions by
that officer. The goods were dyes or colors called naphthylamine red, orange II, orange IV and resorcine red J
At the
trial, before Judge Wheeler and a jury, there was a verdict
for the defendant, and a judgment in his favor for costs, to
review which the plaintiffs have brought a writ of error.
The collector assessed a duty upon the articles in question of
fifty cents per pound and thirty-five per cent ad valorem, under
that provision of schedule Al of section 2504 of the Revised Statutes, 2d ed. p. 479, which reads as follows "Paints and dyesaniline dyes and colors, by whatever name known. fifty cents
per pound, and thirty-five per centum ad valorem." The plaintiffs claimed, in their protest, that the articles were not aniline
dyes, and were liable to a duty of only twenty per cent ad
valorem, under section 2516 of the Revised Statutes, which
provides that "there shall be levied, collected and paid on the
importation of all raw or unmanufactured articles, not herein
enumerated or provided for, a duty of ten per centum ad valorem, and on all articles manufactured in whole or in part,
not herein enumerated or provided for, a duty of twenty per
centum ad valorem."
The course of legislation on the subject of duties on aniline
dyes has been as follows By section 11 of the act of June 30,
1864, c. 171, 13 Stat. 212, the following duty was imposed.
"On aniline dyes, one dollar per pound and thirty-five per
centum ad valorem." By section 21 of the act of July 14,
1870, c. 255, 16 Stat. 264, the following duty was imposed
"On aniline dyes and colors, by whatever name known, fifty
cents per pound, and thirty-five per centum ad valorem," and
by section 22 of the same act, p. 266, picric acid, which appears
to be not chemically an aniline dye, but a phenol dye, though
obtained from coal-tar, was made free of duty The provision
of the act of 1870, in regard to aniline dyes and colors, was

Opinion of the Court.

carried into the Revised Statutes, enacted in 1874, as was also
the provision in regard to picric acid.
The question sought to be raised by the plaintiffs m the
present case could not arise under the Revised Statutes as
amended by the act of March 3, 1883, c. 121, because, under
title 33, ยง 2502, schedule A, as enacted by the act of March
3, 1883, 22 Stat. 493, the following duty is imposed "All
coal-tar colors or dyes, by whatever name known, and not
specially enumerated or provided for in this act, thirty-five
per centum ad valorem;" and picric acid was not included by
name in the list of articles made free of duty by section 2503
as enacted by the act of March 3, 1883. The articles in question, which, it is claimed, were not aniline dyes or colors, are
admitted to be "coal-tar colors or dyes."
The plaintiffs claimed on the trial, and claim here, that the
words "aniline dyes and colors, by whatever name known,"
are words of description, and not words used in a general
commercial sense. They therefore introduced a good deal of
evidence for the purpose of showing that the articles in question were, physically and chencally, not aniline dyes or colors, though derived from coal-tar. It was shown that none of
those articles were known in commerce at the time the Revised
Statutes were enacted, resorcine red J having been known first
in 1875, orange II and IV in 1877, and naphthylamine red in
1878. On the other hand, the defendant introduced testimony
for the purpose of showing that the articles in question were
known in trade, when imported, as "aniline dyes," and that
in 1874 the term "aniline dyes" had been applied in trade to
all dyes derived from coal-tar, or artificial dyes.
The testimony on the part of the plaintiffs tended to show
that the articles in question were not chemically aniline colors, that naphthylamine red and orange II and IV were azo
colors, that re-orcine red J was an eosine color; that picric
acid was a phenol color; that aniline colors had high tinctorial
power, as compared with natural colors, while the tinctorial
power of azo colors was no higher than that of natural colors,
that aniline colors attached themselves to fabrics without
manipulation, easily and directly, while azo colors attached

Opinion of the Court.

themselves with more difficulty, being assisted by mordants,
that aniline colors were wanting in fastness, while azo colors
were relatively fast, that aniline colors were generally on the
blue shades, either blues or violets, or reds which contained
blue or green, while azo colors had exactly the shades that
aniline colors lacked, - yellows, orange and yellowish reds,
that aniline colors were not fast to acids or alkalies, while azo
colors were relatively fast to both acids and alkalies, and were
sometimes even brightened or cleared by acids and alkalies,
that aniline colors combined readily with albumen, which was
largely used as a mordant and in photography, while azo
colors did not combine with albumen, and that aniline colors
were not acid, unless sulphonated, while azo colors were always
acid. In regard to resorcme red J, the plaintiffs gave evidence
tending to show that an aniline color could be used as a dye,
while resorcine red could not be used generally as a dye, that
an aniline color could not be used generally or efficiently for
paints, while resorcine red was generally used as a pigment
for paints; and that the color of an aniline dye was a crimson,
running up to violet or bluish red, while the color of resorcine
red was scarlet or yellowish red.
The plaintiffs insist that the court erred at the trial in admitting evidence to show what the importations in question
were called in trade at the time of the trial in 188-1, which
was ten years after the Revised Statutes were enacted, and
five years after the entries took place, that it also erred in
admitting evidence to show the signification of the words
"aniline dyes and colors," as a commercial term in contradistinction to a descriptive term, and that it erred in refusing to
charge the jury, as requested by the plaintiffs, as follows
"That the term aniline dyes and colors, by whatever name
known, is not used in a general commercial sense, but as a
descriptive term, and primarily includes only such dyes as are
m fact aniline by their constitution," and also "That, in
determining the question at issue, to instruct the jury to disregard all the testimony of the defendant as to the general
name under which the articles in question were bought and
sold."

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

They complain that the court erred in charging the jury
that, if any of the articles in question would be, according to
the understanding of commercial men, dealers in the articles
and importers of them, included in the class of articles known
as aniline dyes, by whatever name they had come to be known
at the time in question, they were subject to the duty imposed
on aniline dyes, that Congress used the term "aniline dyes"
as applied to a class of articles which, in June, 1874, had
acquired that name by reputation and use among dealers in
and importers of such articles, and that the statute was made
for the future.
They also complain that the court refused to charge the
jury, as requested by the plaintiffs, as follows "That it is
immaterial how the articles in question were regarded in
trade, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to a verdict if they
are satisfied, upon a fair preponderance of testimony, that the
dyes in question are a new and different dye from the aniline
dyes known in 1874, and are not in fact aniline dyes, unless the
jury should find similitude under the statute." They also complain that the court refused to charge the jury, as requested
by the plaintiffs, as follows "If the jury find that the plamtiffs' goods were not known in commerce until since June,
187'4, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, unless the jury find
they bear the statutory similitude to the aniline dyes and
colors known in 1874." In regard to each of these last two
requests, the court declined to charge otherwise than as it had
already charged.
They further complain that the court erred in refusing to
charge, as requested by the plaintiffs, that, if the jury should
find, upon a fair preponderance of testunony, that the articles
in question "were used as a substitute and in place of cochineal, and not as a substitute for any aniline dye known at the
time of their introduction, the plaintiffs, on that branch of the
case, are entitled to a verdict." In regard to that request,
the court said that the general instruction to the jury on the
subject was sufficient.
We think that the objections to evidence before recited, and
the objections before mentioned to particular parts of the

PIOKHARDT v. MERRITT.
Opimon of the Court.

charge of the court, and to the refusals of the court to charge,
and to its refusal to charge otherwise than as it had charged,
are untenable.
The court instructed the jury that if the four articles in
question, according to the understanding of commercial men,
dealers in and importers of them, would, when imported, "be
included in the class of articles known as aniline dyes, by whatever name they had come to be known," they were subject to
duty as aniline dyes, and the defendant was entitled to a verdict: We see no objection to this instruction. It was in accordance with the established rule that, in interpreting customs
statutes, commercial terms are to be construed according to
the commercial understanding in regard to them. Nor is this
rule inapplicable to this case because the articles in question
were unknown in 1874, when the statute was enacted. As the
court said to the jury, the law was made for the future, and
the term "aniline dyes and colors, by whatever name known,"
included articles which should be commercially known, whenever afterwards imported, as "aniline dyes and colors." In
_Yewman v Arthur, 109 U. S. 132, it was held that the fact
that, at the date of an act imposing duties, goods of a certain
kind had not been manufactured, does not withdraw them
from the class to which they belong, when the language of
the statute clearly and fairly includes them. But it is sufficient if it so includes them according to commercial understanding.
The bill of exceptions states as follows "In the course of
the trial a large amount of testimony was introduced, on behalf
of both parties, as to the similitude or resemblance, under
Revised Statutes, section 2499, of the dyes and colors of the
plaintiffs' importations and various dyes and colors known in
trade of this country, and by chemsts from 1869 to time of
trial, as aniline dyes and colors, it being contended upon the
part of the defendant that the importations of the plaintiffs, if
not specified under and covered by the term aniline dyes, yet
that they were chargeable as aniline dyes by similitude."
Section 2499, thus referred to, reads as follows "There
shall be levied, collected, and paid, on each and every nonVOL. Cxxi=-i-17

enumerated article which bears a similitude, either m material,
quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any
article enumerated in this title as chargeable with duty, the
same rate of duty which is levied and charged on the enumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned, and if any non-enumerated article
equally resembles two or more enumerated articles, on which
different rates of duty are chargeable, there shall be levied,
collected, and paid, on such non-enumerated article, the same
rate of duty as is chargeable on the article which it resembles
paying the highest duty, and on all articles manufactured
from two or more materials, the duty shall be assessed at the
highest rates at which any of its component parts may be
chargeable."
On the question of similitude the court instructed the jury
that if the articles in question did not fall within the class of
articles known as "aniline dyes," or either of them did not,
the jury were then to proceed to the consideration of the
question arising under section 2499 of the Revised Statutes, as
to similitude, that, if the four articles did not fall within the
class of "aniline dyes," then the question would be whether
any one of them bore a similitude, either in "material, quality,
texture, or the use to which it may be applied," to what were
known as aniline dyes at the time the Revised Statutes were
enacted, that, if it did, it was dutiable at the same rate as
aniline dyes were, that the word "texture" did not apply to
the subject, that, if any one of the articles bore a similitude
or resemblance, in material or quality, to what were known
as aniline dyes in 187'4, it was dutiable at the same rate as an
aniline dye, that if either of them bore a similitude in the use
to which it might be applied, to aniline dyes known and m
use m 1874, it was dutiable at the same rate as an aniline dye,
that the mere application to the dyeing of fabrics would not
create the similitude, but that if there was a similitude m the
mode of use, a similitude in the same kind of dyeing, producing
the same colors in substantially the same way, so as to take
the place of aniline dyes in use, there would be a similitude m
use, that if all the articles were neither aniline dyes nor bore

opinion of the Court.

such similitude the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict for the
full amount they claim, that, if any less than all of them were
neither aniline dyes nor bore such similitude, the plaintiffs
were entitled to a verdict as to those, for the amount of duties
charged which ought not to have been charged, that the
question was whether the articles fell within the description
of "aniline dyes or colors, by whatever name known," as
commercially known, or bore a similitude to articles which fell
within that description, as they were known in 1874, that the
jury were not to consider "aniline dyes" as a term synonymous with "coal-tar dyes," and that they were to look at the
term "aniline dyes" according to its commercial usage in 1874.
The plaintiffs excepted to that part of the charge in regard
to similitude which had reference to the expression "similitude
in material," and to that part which related to "similitude m
the same kind of dyeing," and also requested the court to
charge the jury, "in respect to similitude of quality," that the
mere quality of producing color, or dyeing, was not a sufficient
similitude to warrant the jury in finding a verdict for the
defendant by reason of similitude. In response to this request,,
the court said that it had already instructed the jury that the
mere fact that the article would color was not a similitude.
The plaintiffs also excepted to the charge of the court as to
similitude in use.
We are of opinion that the charge on the subject of similitude submitted the question properly to the jury, and that it
was not error to refuse the request to charge, that, if the jury
should find that any one of the articles was used as a substitute
and in place of cochineal, and not as a substitute for any aniline dye known at the time of its. introduction, the plaintiffs,
as to that branch of the case, were entitled to a verdict.
Other questions are raised in the bill of exceptions which we
do.not deem it necessary to notice particularly We see no
error in the record.
Judgment affi'rmed.
