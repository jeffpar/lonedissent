SAWYER v. KOCHERSPERGER.
Opinion of the Court.

Can there be a doubt that such inamong his children?
equality of legislation would vitiate it? But. whatever may
be the power of the legislature, Illinois had r6gulated the
matter of- descents and distributions and had granted the
right of testamentary disposition. And now by this statute
upon property passing in accordance with its statutes a tax
is imposed; a tax unequal because not proportioned to the
amount of the estate; unequal because based upon a classification purely arbitrary, to wit, that ol wealth--a tax
directly and intentionally made unequal. I think the Constitution of the United States forbids such inequality.

SAWYER v0.KOCHERSPERGER. Error to the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Illinois. No. 463.
MR. JUSTICE McOKENNA: This was a petition by Kochersperger,
as county treasurer and collector of Cook County, Illinois, filed

in the County Court of that county, against Elizabeth E. Sawyer
and others seeking the collection of certain taxes. The case was
removed into the Circuit Court of the United States, but improvidently, as it falls within the rule laid down in Tennessee v. Banks,
152 U. S. 454, notwithstanding the petition stated that defend-

ants declined to pay on the ground that the law imposing the taxes
was in violation of the Constitution of the United States.
Decree reversed, and cause remanded to the Circuit Court with a
direction to remand the case to the County Court of Cook County,
the costs of this court and of the Circuit Court to be paid by plaintiffs in error.

These two cases were argued with No. 464.
