MAGOUN v. ILLINOIS TRUST AND SAVINGS
BANK.
APPEAL FROM THE

CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 464. Argued January 28, 1898. -Decided

April 25, 1898.

The Inheritance tax law of Illinois, of June 15, 1895, (Laws of 1895, page
301), makes a classification for taxation which the legislature had power
to make, and does not conflict in any way with the provisions of the
Constitution of the United States.

THIs was a bill in equity filed in the Circuit Court of the
United States in and for the Northern District of Illinois by
Jessie Norton Torrence Magoun, a resident-and' citizen of

New York, ag.dnst the Trust Company, as executor of and
trustee under the last will and testament of Joseph T. Torrence, deceased, and the county treasurer of Cook County, Illinois, both residents and citizens of Illinois, to remove a cloud
from the real estate devised by said decedent to the complainant, and to enjoin the first-named defendant from voluntarily
paying, and the county treasurer from collecting or receiving.

the inheritance tax, amounting to more than $5000, alleged
to be due upon the entire estate -of said decedent, and for
which the complainant's interest in said estaite was contended โข
by the county treasurer to be liable.
The bill set forth the will of the decedent, a description
and valuation of the real estate and personal property left by
him, amounting in all to $600,000 above his debts, and the
demand of the county treasurer for the inheritance tax, which,
by the act in question, is made a lien upon all of said property,
the request of the complainant to the defendant Trust Company not to pay the same and to contest the constitutionality
of the act; to refrain from paying the same voluntarily and
without protest, and to -await the commencement of legal
proceedings to enforce the same; the refusal of the Trust
Company to comply with this request, and its threat and in-

tention to pay said tax at once voluntarily, which payment
could not be recovered if said law should hereafter be declared
unconstitutional.
The bill also alleged that such payment would result in
waste of the estate, and would be a breach of trust on the
part of said executor, to the irreparable loss and injury of the
complainant-; that the alleged lien of the tax clouds the title
to the real property and renders the same unmarketable, and
that the act is in conflict with the provisions of the Fourteenth
Amend ment.
The Trust Company answered, admitting the allegations of
fact in the bill, but submitting the question of the constitutionality of the law to the court and praying to be advised of
its rights and dutied in the premises as executor and trustee
aforesaid and a, an officer of the court.
The county treasurer denied that the act was unconstitutional, and admitted the allegations respecting the estate of
the deceased, the interest of the complainant therein, the lien
of the inheritance tax thereon and the demand made therefor.
The cause was heard on bill and answers, and a decree was
entered dismissing the bill from which an appeal was prayed
to this court and allowed.
The act under which the taxes complained of were assessed
is entitled "An-act to tax gifts, legacies and inheritances in
certain cases and to provide for the collection of the same."
Rev. Stat. Illinois, 1895, c. 120. It is only necessary to quote
its first and second sections, which are as follows:
"ยง 1. Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois,

fendants in error.

MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
Legacy and inheritance taxes are not new in our laws.
They have existed in Pennsylvania for over sixty years, and
have been enacted in other States. They are not new in the
laws of other countries. In State v. Alston, 94 Tennessee, 674,
Judge Wilkes gave a short history of them as follows: "Sucih
taxes were recognized by the Roman law. Gibbon's Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. 1, pp. 163-4. They were
adopted in England in 1780, and have been much extended
since that date. Dowll's History of Taxation in England,
148; Acts 20 George III, c. 28; 45 George III, c. 28; 16 and
17 Victoria, c. 51; Green v. Craft, 2 11. Bl. 30; Bill v. Atkin-son, 2 Merivale, 45. Such taxes are now in force generally
in the countries of Europe. (Review of Reviews, February,
1893.) In the United States they were enacted in Pennsylvania in i826; Maryland, 1844; Delaware, 1869; West Vir-

Ohio, Maine, M'assachusetts, 1891; Tennessee in 1891, chapter
25 now repealed by chapter 174, acts 1893. They were
adopted in North Carolina in 1846, but repealed in 1883.
Were enacted in Virginia in 1844, repealed in 1855, reenacted
in 1863, and repealed in 1884."
Other States have also
enacted them - Minnesota by constitutional provision.
The constitutionality of the taxes have been declared, and
the principles upon which they are bgsed explained in United
States v. Perkins,163 U. S. 625, 628; Strode v. Commonwealth,
52 Penn: St. 181; Eyre v. Jacob, 14 Grat. 422; Scitolfleld
v. -Lynchburg,78 Virginia, 366; State v. Dalrymple, 70 Maryland, 29T; Clapp v. MJason, 94 U. S. 589; In re .Merriam's
Estate, 141 N. Y. 479; State v. Hlamlin, 86 Maine, 495;
State v. Alston, 94 Tennessee, 674; n re Wilmerding, 117
California, 281; Dos 'Passos Collateral Inheritance Tax, 20;
Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Mass. 113; Gelsthoipe v. FJurnell,
[Montana] 51 Pac. Rep. 267. See also Scholey v. Reew, 23
Wall. 331.
It is not necessary to review these cases, or state at length
the reasoning by which they are supported. They are based
on two principles: 1. An inheritance tax is not one on property, but one on the succession., 2. The right to take property
by devise or descent is the, creature of the law, and not a
natural right -- a privilege, and therefore the authority which
confers it may impose conditions upon it. From these principles it is deduced that the States may tax the privilege, discriminate between relatives, and between these and strangers,
and grant exemptions; and are not precluded from this power
by the provisions of the respective state constitutions requiring uniformity and equality of taxation.
The second principle was given prominence in the arguments at bar. The appellee claimed that the power of the'
State could be exerted to the extent of making the State the
heir to everybody, and the appellant asserted a natural right
of children to inherit. Of the former proposition we are not
required to express an opinion. Nor indeed of the latter, for
appellant conceded that testamentary disposition and inheri-

tance were subject to regulation. However, as pertinent to
the subject, decisions of this court may be cited.
In United States v. Fox., 94 U. S. 315, 320, a law of the
State of New York confining devises to natural persons and
corporations created under its laws was considered, and a
devise of land to the United States was held void. The court
said :
"The power of the State to regulate the tenure 'of real
property within her limits, and the modes of its acquisition
and transfer, and the rules of its descent, and the extent to
which a testamentary disposition of it may be exercised by
its owners, is undoubted. It is an established principle of
law, everywhere'recognized, arising from the necessity of the
case, that the disposition of immovable property, whether by
deed, descent or any other niode, is exclusively subject to the
government within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.
MecCormicek v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 202.

Statutes of

wills, as is justly observed by the Court of Appeals, are
enabling acts, and prior to the statute of 32 Henry VIII there
was no general power at common law to devise lands. The
power was opposed to the feudal policy of holding lands
inalienable without the consent bf the lord. The English
Statute of Wills became a part of the law of New York upon
the adoption of her constitution in 1777; and, with some
modification in its language, remains so at this day. Every
person must, therefore, devise his lands in that State within
the limitations of the statute'or he cannot devise them at all.
His power is bounded by its conditions."
In Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493, there was considered
the validity of a law of Louisiana imposing a tax of ten per cent
upon legacies, when the legatee was neither a citizen of the
United States nor domiciled therein. -Mr.Chief Justice Taney
considered the legal question of easy solution, and disposed of
it summarily. He said: "This is a plain case, and when the
facts are stated the questions of law may be disposed of in a
few words." After stating the case briefly, he further said:
"Now, the law in question is nothing more than an exercise
of the power which every State and sovereignty possesses, of
VOL. CLXX-19

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

regulating the manner and term upon which property, real or
personal, within its dominion may be transmitted by last will
and testament, or by inheritance; and of prescribing who shall
and who shall not be capable of taking it. Evefy State or
nation may unquestionably refuse to allow an align to take
either. real or personal property situated within its limits,
either as heir or legatee, and may, if it thinks proper, direct
that property so descending or bequeathed shall belong to the
State. In many of .the States of this Union at this day real
property devised to- an alien is liable to escheat. And if a
State may deny the privilege altogether, it follows that, when
it grants it, it may. annex to the grant any conditions which
it supposes to be required by its interests or policy. This has
been done by'Louisiana. The right to take has been given to
the alien, subject to-a deduction of ten per cent for the use
of the State.
.4"In some of the States laws have been passed at different
times imposing a tax similar to the one now in question upon
its own citizens as welf as foreigners, and the constitutionality
of these laws has never been questioned. And if a State may
impose it upon its own citizens, it will hardly be contended
that aliens are entitled to exemption; and that their property
in our own country is not liable to the same burdens that may
lawfully be imposed upon that of our own citizens.
"We can see no objection to such a tax, whether imposed
on citizens and aliens alike, or upon the latter exclusively."
In Unitd Staes v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625, 627, the inheritance tax law of the State of New York was involved. Mr.
Justice ]Brown, speaking for this court, said:
"While the laws of all civilized States recognize in every
citizen the absolute right to his own earnings, and to the enjoyment of his-own property, and the increase thereof, during
his life, except so far as the State may require him to contribute his share for public. expenses, the right to dispose of his
property by will has always been considered purely a creature
of statute and within legislative control. 'By the common
law, as it stood in the reign of Henry II, a man's goods were
to be divided into three equal 'parts;"of which one went to his

Opinion of the Court.

heirs or lineal descendants, another to his wife, and a third was
at his own disposal; or if he died without a wife, be might
then dispose of one moiety, and the other went to his children;
and so, e converso, if he had no children, the wife was entitled
to one moiety, and he might bequeath the other; but if he died
without either wife or issue, the whole was at his own disposal.'
2 Bl. Com. 492. Prior to the statute of wills, enacted in the
reign of Henry VIII, the right to a testamentary disposition
of the property did not extend to real estate at all, and as to
personal estate was limited, as above stated. Although these
restrictions have long since been abolished in England, and
never existed in this country, except in Louisiana, the right of
a widow to her dower and to a share in the personal estate is
ordinarily secured to her by statute.
"By' the Code Napoleon, gifts of property, whether by acts
inter vivos or by will, must not exceed one half the estate
if the testator leave but one child, one third if he leaves two
children; one fourth if he leaves three or more. If he have
no children, but leaves ancestors, both in the paternal and
maternal line, he may-give away but one half of his property,
and but three fourths if he have ancestors in but one line. By
the law of Italy, one half a testators'property must be distributed equally among all his children; the other half he may
leave to his eldest son or to whomsoever he pleases. Similar
restrictions upon the power 6f disposition by will are found
in the codes of other continental countries, as well as in the
State of Louisiana. Though the general consent of the most
enlightened nations has, from the earliest historical period,
recognized a natural right in children to inherit the property
of their parents, we know of no legal principle to prevent the
legislature from taking away or limiting the right of testamentary disposition or imposing such conditions upon its
exercise as it may deem conducive to public good."
Against the cases sustaining inheritance taxes and their
classifications and exemptions, appellants cite State v. Mann,
76 Wisconsin, 469; State v. Gorman, 40 Minnesota, 232;
Oum-y v. Spencer, 61 N. H. 624; State v. Terris, 53 Ohio
St. 314 and -7issouriv. Switzer, lately decided.

OCTOBER TERIMy, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

These cases are not in all points irreconcilable with those
first cited. CNrry v. Spencer is extreme. It was held that
an exception from an otherwise general inheritance law of
legacies to husband or wife, children or grandchildren, of the
person who died last seized offended the rigid uniformity of
the constitution of that State and its bill of rights. The court
however said, speaking by Blodgett, J.: "It is not to be
questioned that the power to tax is vested in the legislature ;
that it is unrestricted, except when it is opposed to some provision of the Federal or state constitution, and that it extends
to every'trade or occupation, to every-object of industry, use
or enjoyment, and to every species of possession." And quoting 2 B1. Coiu. 12, he further said : "Wills, therefore, testaments, and rights of inheritances and successions are all of
them creatures of the civil or municipal laws, and accordingly
are in all respects regulated by them."
. In State v. Mann and State v. Gorman, the distinction between a tax on successions and one on property was not necessary to observe. Sta., v. Gorman, however, may be claimed
as deciding that a tdl based on the value of the estates is contrary to th6 rule of equality; also that exemptions are. State
v. Ferris and State v. Switzer do not oppose the principles
upon which inheritance taxes are sustained, but only decide
that the statutes passed on were repugnant to equality and
uniformity of taxation as prescribed by the state constitutions.
They are authority against the Illinois statute. But it is not
necessary to dwell on the points of agreement of the cases.
Our inquiry must be not what will satisfy the provisions of
the state constitutions, but what will satisfy the rule of the
Federal Constitution. The power of the States over successions may be as plenary in the abstract as appellee contends
for, nevertheless it must be exerted within the limitations of
that constitution. If the power of devise or of inheritance be
a privilege, it must be conferred or regulated by equal laws.
This brings us to the law in controversy. The appellant
attacks both its principles and its provisions- its principles
as necessarily arbitrary and its. provisions as causing discriminations and creating inequality in the brdens of taxation.

MAGOUN v. ILLINOIS TRUST & SAVINGS BANK.

293

Opinion of the Court.

Is the act open to this criticism? The clause of the Fourteenth Amendment especially invoked is that which prohibits
a State denying to any citizen the equal protection of the
laws. What satisfies this equality has not been and probably
never can be precisely defined. Generally it has been said
that it "only requires the same means and methods to be
applied impartially to all the constituents of a class so that
the law*shall operate equally and uniformly upon all persons
ifentucky Railroad Tax cases,
in similar circumstances."
115 U. S. 321, 337. It does not prohibit. legislation which is
limited, either in the objects to which it is directed or by the
territory within which it is to operate. It merely requires
that all persons gubjected to such legislation shall be treated
alike under like circumstances and conditibns, both in the
H7ayes v.
privilege conferred and tht liabilities imposed.
Missouri, 120 U. S.68. Similar citations could be multiplied.
But what is the test of likeness and unlikeness of circumstances and conditions? These expressions have almost the
generality of the principle they are used to expound, and yet
they are definite steps to precision and usefulness of definition,
when connected with the facts of the cases in which they are
employed. .With these for illustration it may be safely said
that the rule prescribes no rigid equality and permits to the
discretion and wisdom of the State a wide latitude as far as
concerned. Nor with the iinterference by this-court is'
Mr. Justice Field said in
policy of a law has it concern.
.Mobile County v. Kimball, 102 U. S. 691, that this court is
not a harbor in which can be found a refuge from ill-advised,
unequal and oppressive state legislation. And he observed
in another case: "It is hardly necessary to say that hardship,
impolicy or injustice of state laws is not necessarily an objection to their constitutional validity."
The rule; therefore, is not a substitute for municipal law;
it only prescribes that that law have the attribute of equality
of operation, and equality of operation does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons
according to their relations. In some circumstances it may
not tax A more than B, but if A be of a different trade or

Opinion of the Court.

profession than B, it may. And in matters not of taxation,
if A be a different kind of corporation than B, it may subject
A to a different rule of responsibility to servants than B,
Missouri Pacigc Railway v. .Mackey, 127 U. S.205, to a different measure of damages than B, .Minneapolis & St. Louis
Railway v. Beckwith, 129 U. S. 26, and it permits special

v.ferrick, 127 U. S. -210 ; Duncan v. 3 1issouri, 152 U. S. 377.
In other words, the State may distinguish, select and classify
objects of legislation, and necessarily this power must have
a wide range of discretion. It is not without limitation, of
course. "1
Clear and hostile discriminations against particular
persons and classes, especially such as are of unusual character,
unknown to the practice of our governments, might be obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition," said Mr. Justice
Bradley, in Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania,134 U. S.
232, 237.
And Mr. Justice Brewer, in Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fj
Railway v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 165, after a careful consideration of many cases, said: "It is apparent that the mere fact
of classification is not sufficient to relieve a statute from the
reach of the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and that in all cases it must appear not only that a classification has been made, but also that it is one based upon some
reasonable ground -some difference which bears a just and
proper relation to the attempted classification -and is not a
mere arbitrary selection."
Two principles, therefore, must be reconciled in the Illinois
inheritance law if it is to be sustained, the equality of protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment,
and the power of the State to classify persons and property.
The latter principle needs further consideration. What test is
there of the reasonableness of a classification - of one based
upon "some difference which bears a just and proper relation
to the attempted classification -and is not a mere arbitrary
selection?" Legislation special in character is not forbidden
by it, as we have seen. Treating mechanics as a class, and

giving them a lien for the amount of their work, has been held
reasonable. Charging a railroad corporation and not other
corporations or persons with an attorney's fee has been held
unreasonable, yet the former would seem to be as much an
exclusive favor as the latter an exclusive burden.
Of taxation, and the case at bar is of taxation, Mr. Justice
Bradley said in the Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania,134
U. S. 232, and Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in Giozza v. lTernan,
148 U. S. 657, that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended
to compel the State to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation.
The range of the State's power was expressed by Mr. Justice
Bradley, as follows: "It inay, if it chooses, exempt certain
classes of property from any taxation at all, such as churches,
libraries and the property of -charitable institutions. It may
impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and vary the rates of excise upon- various products;
it may tax real estate and personal property in a different
manner; it may tax visible property only, and not tax securities for payment of money; it may allow deductions for indebtedness, or not allow them. All such regulations, and
those of like character, so long as they proceed within reasonable limits and general usage, are within the discretion of the
state legislature, or the people of the State framing their constitution."
And so Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court in Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 105, said: The Federal Constitution imposes no restraints on the State in regard to
unequal taxation.
The coutt, through Mr. Justice Lamar, in Pacific Express
Co. v. Seibert, 142 U. S. 339, was equally emphatic. lie said
on page 351: "This court has repeatedly laid down the doctrine that diversity of taxation, both with respect to the
amount imposed and the various species of property selected
either for bearing its burdens or from being exempt from them,
is not inconsistent with a perfect uniformity and equality of
taxation in the proper sense of those terms; and that a system
which imposes the same tax upon every species of property,
irrespective of its nature or condition or class, will be destruc-

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

tive of the principles of uniformity and equality in taxation
and of a just adaptation of property to its burdens." And it
was said in Xlercants' Baank v. Pennsylvania, 167 U. S. 461 :
"Indeed, this whole argument of a right under the Federal
Constitution to challenge the tax law on the ground of inequality in the burdens resulting from the operation of the
law is put at rest by the decision in Bell's Gap Railroad v.
Pennsylvania."
'There is therefore no precise application of the rule of
reasonableness of classification, and the rule of equality perfaits many practical inequalities. And necessarily so. In a
classification for governmental purposes there cannot be an
exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and things. Bearing
these considerations in mind we can solve the questions in
controversy.
There are three main classes in the Illinois statute, the first
and second being based, respectively, on lineal and collateral
relationship to the testator or intestate, and the third being
composed of strangers to his blood and distant relatives.
The latter is again divided into four subclasses dependent upon
the amount of the estate received. The first two classes,
therefore, depend on substantial differences, differences which
may distinguish them from each other and them or either
of them from the other class -differences, therefore, which
"bear a just and proper relation to the attempted classificaiion "-the
rule expressed in the Gulf, Colorado & Santa
_F Railway v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150. And if the constituents
of each class are affected alike, the rule of equality prescribed
by the cases is satisfied. In other words, the law operates
"equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances."
But the appellant asserts discrimination, and claims that
the exemptions produce the greatest inequality. As stated
above, the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois passed on
andsustained the law in the Drake case, and, claiming the
opinion for support, the appellant contends that there are two
distinct systems and principles applied in the act, the one
basing the tax on the amount received or the value of the

privilege of succession; the other basing the tax upon the
estate owned by the decedent, irrespective of the amount or
value of the legacy. And discriminations hence resulting, or
rather which are claimed as hence resulting, are detailed.
We, however, do not read the opinion as counsel do. In
answer to the objection that the statute offended against
uniformity or proportion to valuation as prescribed by the
constitution of Illinois, the court said:
"That statute provides certain classes of property, which
were a part of an estate, shall be exempt from taxation under
these provisions; and when the legislature provides other
classes of property, some of which shall pay one dollar per
hundred, others two, others three and others four, and still
others five, and again others six dollars per hundred, six different classes are created under and by which a tax is levied
by valuation on the right of succession to a separate class of
property.
"The class on which a tax is thus levied is general, uniform,
and pertains to all species of property included *ithin that
class. A tax which affects the property within a specific class
is uniform as to the class, and there is no provision of the constitution which precludes legislative action from assessing a
tax on that particular class. By this act of the legislature six
classes of property are created heretofore absolutely unknown.
It is those classes Qf property depending upon the estate owned
by one dying possessed thereof which the State may regulate as to
its descent and the right to devise. The tax assessed on classes
thus created is absolutely uniform on the classes upon which
it operates, and under the provisions of the-statute is to be
determined by valuation, so that every person and corporation
shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its
property inherited, and is not inconsistent with the principle
of taxation fixed by the constitution, and is clearly within
the sections of the constitution quoted. No want of uniformity with one liv'ing who owns property can be urged as
a reason why the statute makes an inconsistent rule. No
person inherits property or can take by devise except by
the statute; and the State, having power to regulate this ques-

tion, may create classes and provide for uniformity with reference to classes which were before unknown."
The words which we have italicized are urged to support
appellant's contention, but it is manifest that they do not do
so when considered in relation to that which precedes and
follows them, and it is, therefore, the estates which descend
or are received which the court decides are new property,
and which are to pay a tax in proportion to their value.
Appellant, however, says: "The progression is likewise
unnecessarily arbitrary if we take the view that the tax is
levied on the amount received. . . . Under such an assumption those taking the larger amounts are required to pay
a larger rate on the same sums upon which those taking
smaller sums pay a smaller rate; that is to say, one who
receives a legacy of $10,000 pays 3 per cent, or $300, thus
receiving $9700 net, while one receiving a legacy of $10,001
pays 4 per cent on the whole- amount, or $400.04, thus reciving $9600.96, $99.04: less than the one whose legacy was
actually one dollar less valuable. This method is applied
throughout the class. Other examples might be stated."
The reasoning of appellant is based on the view that the
tax is one on property instead of one on the succession, as
held. by the Supreme Court of the State. Being on the succession, the court further held, as we have seen, that the latter
is to be regarded as new property, and the $20,000 and other
property not taxed are not,.therefore, exemptions.
.,In. this-,view the Illinois court is in harmony with the
majority of other courts of the country. We concur in the
reasoning. It is true that the amount of the exemption is
greater in the Illinois law than in any other, but the right to
exempt cannot depend on that. Whether it shall be $20,000 as
in Illinois'law or $10,000 as in that of Massachusetts, or other
amounts as in other laws, must depend upon the judgment of
the legislature of each State, and cannot be subject to judicial
review. If such review could ascertain, the factors of judgment
and dould apply them with indisputable wisdom to the different conditions existing, it would be outside of its province to
do so. That manifestly is a legislative, not a;judicial, function.

Opinion of the Court.

The first and second cases, therefore, of the statute depend
on substantial distinctions and their classifications are not
arbitrary. Nor do the exemptions of the statute render its
operation unequal within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment. "The right to make exemptions is involved in
the right to select the subjects of taxation and apportion the
public burdens among them, and must consequently be understood to exist in the lawmaking power wherever it has not in
terms been taken away. To some extent it must exist always,
for the selection of subjects of taxation is of itself an exemption of what is not selected." Cooley on Taxation, 200. See,
also, the remarks of iMr. Justice Bradley in Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania,134 U. S. 232.
The provisions of the statute in regard to the tax on legacies to strangers to the blood of an intestate need further
comment. These provisions are as follows:
"On each and every hundred dollars of the clear market
value of all property and at the same rate for any less amount
on all estates of ten thousand dollars and less, three dollars;
on all estates over ten thousand dollars and not exceeding
twenty thousand dollars, four dollars; on all estates over
twenty thousand dollars and not exceeding fifty thousand
dollars, five dollars; and on all estates over fifty thousand
dollars, six dollars; Provided, that an estate in the above
case which may be valued at a less sum than five hundred
dollars shall not be subject to any duty or tax."
There are four classes created, and manifestly there is
equality between the members of each class. Inequality is
only found by comparing the members of one class with
those of another. It is illustrated by appellant as follows:
One who receives a legacy of $10,000 pays 3 per cent, or
$300, thus receiving $9700 net; while one receiving a legacy
of $10,001 pays 4 per cent on the whole amount, or $400.04,
thus receiving $9600.96, or $99.04 less than the one whose
legacy was actually one dollar less valuable. This method is
applied throughout the class.
These, however, are conceded to be extreme illustrations,
and we think, therefore, that they furnish no test of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

practical operation of the classification. When the legacies
differ in substantial extent, if the rate increases the benefit
increases to greater degree.
If there is unsoundness it must be in the classification.
The members of each class are treated alike, that is to say,
all who inherit $10,000 are treated alike-all who inherit
any other sum are treated alike. There is equality therefore
within the classes. If there is inequality it must be because
the members of a class are arbitrarily made such and burdened
as such upon no distinctions justifying it. This is claimed. It
is said that the tax is not in proportion to the amount but
varies with the amounts arbitrarily fixed, and hence that an
inheritance of $10,000 or less pays 3 per cent, and that one
over $10,000 pays not 3 per cent on $10,000 and an increased
percentage on the excess over $10,000 but an increased percentage on the $10,000 as well as on the excess, and it is said,
as we have seen, that in consequence one who is given a legacy
of ten thousand and one dollars by the deduction of the tax
receives $99.04 less than one who is given a legacy of $10,000.
But neither case can be said to be contrary to the rule of
equality of th'e Fourteenth Amendment. That rule does not
require, as we have seen, exact equality of taxation. It only
requires that the law imposing it shall oper-ate on all alike
under the same circumstances.
The tax is not on money;
it is on the right to inherit; and hence a condition of inheritance, and it may be graded according to the value of that
inheritance. The condition is not arbitrary because it is determined by that value; it is not unequal in operation because it does not levy the same percentage on every dollar;
does not fail to treat "all alike under like circumstances and
conditions, both in the privilege conferred and the liabilities
imposed." The jurisdiction of courts ig fixed by amounts.
The right of appeal is. As was said at bar the Congress of
the United States has classified the right of suitors to come
into the United States courts by amounts. Regarding these
alone, there is the same inequality that is urged against classification of the Illinois law.. All license laws and all specific
taxes have in them an element of inequality, nevertheless

dissenting.

I am unable to concur in the foregoing opinion, so far as it

sustains the constitutionality of that part of the law which

grades the rate of the tax upon legacies to strangers by the
amount of such legacies. If this were a question in political
economy I should not dissent, but it is one of constitutional
limitations. Equality in right, in protection and in burden is
the thought which has run through the life of this Nation and

its constitutional enactments from the Declaration of Independence to the present hour.

Of course, absolute equality is

not attainable, and the fact that a law, whether tax law or

other, works inequality in its actual operation does not prove

created can find any constitutional

That this is a law imposing taxes is not open to question.
The title of the act is "An Act to Tax Gifts, Legacies, etc.,"
and the first section provides that "all property
which shall pass by will or by the intestate laws of this State
shall be, and is, subject to a tax at the rate hereinafter specified." Classifying inheritors and legatees into the
three classes of near relatives, remote relatives and strangers,
and imposing a different rate of taxation as to each of these
classes, may not be objectionable.

The classification is based

upon differences which bear just and proper relation to it, and
where classification is rightful, differences in the rate of taxation may be, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned,
perihissible.

But beyond this classification the statute pro-

-words, the actual tax to be paid does not increase simply as
thelegacy increases, which would be the rule of equality, but
,the rate of taxation is also increased as the amount of the
legacy passes from one sum to another. Upon a legacy over
fifty'thousdnd dollars it is six per cent, while upon one under
' ten thousand dollars it is only three per cent.
It seems to be conceded that if this were a tax upon property such increase in the rate of taxation could not be sustained, but being a tax upon the succession it is held that a
different rule- prevails.
The argument is that because the
State may regulate inheritances and the extent of testamentary disposition it may impose thereon any burdens, including
therein taxes, and impose them in any manner it chooses.
There are doubtless some matters over which the State has
purely arbitrary power. For instance, it is under no obligations to grant any charters, and the legislature may undoubtedly in giving a charter to one set of persons impose one
-series of burdens, and in granting a similar charter to another
set may impose entirely different burdens. But these are
cases of mere gratuities, mere favors and privileges, and any
donor of such -may add to them the burdens he pleases. But
I do not understand that legacies and inheritances stand upon
the same footing. True, the State may regulate, but it has
no arbitrary power in the matter. The property of a decedent does not at his death become the property of the State,
nor subject to its disp6sal according to any mere whim or
fancy. And yet if it is a purely arbitrary power I do not see
what constitutional objection could be raised to any disposition which a legislature might make of the property of any
decedent. Take the illustration made by counsel for appellant: Gould the legislature of Illinois, which passed this
statute, constitutionally enact that the estate of every person
dying within the limits of the State should be given to the
members of that legislature? Or, if the matter of personal
benefit be interposed as against the validity of such legislation, could it enact .that the property of A, on his death,
should pass to the State; the property of B to some religious
or charitable institution; and the property of 0 be divided

equality of legislation would vitiate it? But. whatever may
be the power of the legislature, Illinois had r6gulated the
matter of- descents and distributions and had granted the
right of testamentary disposition. And now by this statute
upon property passing in accordance with its statutes a tax
is imposed; a tax unequal because not proportioned to the
amount of the estate; unequal because based upon a classification purely arbitrary, to wit, that ol wealth--a tax
directly and intentionally made unequal. I think the Constitution of the United States forbids such inequality.

in the County Court of that county, against Elizabeth E. Sawyer
and others seeking the collection of certain taxes. The case was
removed into the Circuit Court of the United States, but improvidently, as it falls within the rule laid down in Tennessee v. Banks,
152 U. S. 454, notwithstanding the petition stated that defend-

ants declined to pay on the ground that the law imposing the taxes
was in violation of the Constitution of the United States.
Decree reversed, and cause remanded to the Circuit Court with a
direction to remand the case to the County Court of Cook County,
the costs of this court and of the Circuit Court to be paid by plaintiffs in error.

These two cases were argued with No. 464.
