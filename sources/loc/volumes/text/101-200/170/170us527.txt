UNITED STATES V. HERRON. Appeal from the Court of Claims.
:No. 272. Submitted with No. 205.
MR. JusTicE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court. This
case, like the preceding, is one for the recovery by a district attorney for services rendered in a Court of Appeals outside the limits
of his district. But in this record there is a distinct finding by
the Court of Claims that the certificate required by section 365,
Revised Statutes, was not given. - Ve are constrained, therefore,
under United States v. Crosthwaite, 168 U. S. 375, to hold that the
judgment cannot be sustained.

The order will be that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Claimsfor fartherproceedings.
