Why should he be punished in addition by the loss of the benefit of a credit given in good faith?
'We are of opinion that the state court erred in its construction of the statute and in peremptorily denying to the creditor
the benefit of the credit. For these reasons the judgment of
the Superior Court is reversed, and the case remanded to that
court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

FAYERWEATUER v. RITCH.
REYNOLDS v. RITCH.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Nos. 157, 158. Argued October 12, 13, 1904.-Decided November 28, 1904.

Where the appellant's contention is that the Circuit Court, by giving unwarranted effect to a judgment of a state court and accepting that judgment, which contained no finding of one of the fundamental facts as a
conclusive determination of that fact, deprived him of his property without due process of law, and that contention is made in good faith, and
under the circumstances, upon reasonable grounds, the application of the
Constitution is involved and this court has jurisdiction of a direct appeal
from the Circuit Court.
Where it appears that a question was distinctly put in issue and the
parties presented, or had an opportunity to present, their evidence, and
the question was decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, private
right and public welfare both demand that the question so adjudicated
shall, except in direct proceedings for review be considered as finally
settled and conclusive upon the parties.
The ordinary rule in cases tried by the court without a jury is that a judgment entered without any special findings is, like a general verdict in a
jury case, tantamount to a finding in favor of the successful party of all
the facts necessary to sustain the judgment.
While in some cases on a plea of res judicata evidence aliunde the record
is proper to show what particular questions were tried and determined

Statement of the Case.

in the former case, it is not competent to introduce the testimony of the
trial judge as to the matters then considered and passed on by him.
Where in an action in a court of competent jurisdiction the validity of
certain releases is put in issue by the pleadings and no judgment can properly be rendered without determining that question, and judgment is rendered against the parties executing the releases and who were before the
trial court, the judgment in effect determines that the releases are valid
and the question of their validity is res judicata notwithstanding no
special findings in regard thereto were made by the trial judge.

THE controlling question in these cases arises on pleas of
res judicata. The essential facts are as follows:
On October 6, 1884, Daniel B. Fayerweather, a citizen and
resident of the State of New York, made a will, by the ninth
article of which he gave to twenty colleges bequests amounting in the aggregate to $2,100,000. By the tenth article he
gave the residuary estate to his executors, as trustees, directing them to divide it equally among the twenty colleges named
in the ninth article. On the same day he signed the following
statement:
"This certifies that I have executed my will of this date,
having been advised by my counsel of the provision and re-

strictions of the law of this State relative to benevolent corporations. I trust my heirs will permit the provision of this
my will to be carried into effect."
At that time by chap. 360, Laws of 1860 of the State of
New York, a testator having husband, wife, child or parent
was forbidden to give to literary or benevolent institutions
more than one-half of his estate. On December 13, 1884, the
testator made a first codicil to his will, by which he revoked
the tenth article and gave the residuary of his estate absolutely to his executors. In other respects the will was ratified.
At or about the same time a paper, bearing date December 11, 1884, headed "Private Memorandum," was signed by
him, which reads as follows:
"I have made Messrs. Bulkley and Ritch my residuary
legatees in the confidence that thereby my intentions as expressed in my will shall be carried into effect, and without

litigations on the part of any person or persons interested.
In case of my death I trust that they will take such steps, by
will or otherwise, as will protect my estate against the contingency of the death of either before my estate is settled
and distributed."
By subsequent codicils minor changes were made, and
Henry B. Vaughan was added as executor. The testator died
on November 15, 1890, leaving a wid6w and three nieces, his
only heirs at law and next of kin. On the day of his death he
executed a codicil, which was mainly a confirmation of the
provisions of the will and prior codicils.
Mr. Fayerweather's estate amounted at the date of the will
to about three millions of dollars, and at the time of his death
to from five to six millions of dollars, mainly in personal
property.
While by articles in the will, prior to the ninth, he had
made provision for his widow and also bequests to his three
nieces, yet obviously his purpose was to give the bulk of his
estate to the several colleges named, and to avoid the restraining effect of the New York statute. After the death
of Mr. Fayerweather the will and codicils were propounded
for probate, to which the widow and nieces filed objections.
A hearing was had before the Surrogate, and on February 25,
1891, he entered an order admitting the will to probate, and
leaving the contest of the codicils to continue. On February 24, 1891, the three executors, residuary. legatees, made a
deed of gift, which reads:
"Know all men by these presents, That we, Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch and Henry B. Vaughan, residuary devisees and legatees under the will, meaning thereby the original
will and the subsequent codicils of Daniel B. Fayerweather,
late of the city of New York, deceased, prompted by our determination that we will not retain for our own use any part
of the residuary estate left to us by his will, and by the desire
to make such disposition of his said residuary estate as in our
judgment will best honor his memory, do dispose of so much

of the same as shall remain after the payment of all lawful
fees, expenses and charges as follows:
"First, We reserve the power to make, and we retain the
right to assent to any enlargement of the fifteen thousand
dollars a year by the will left to Mrs. Fayerweather, which she
may desire.
"Second, We reserve the power to make, and we retain the
right to assent to any enlargement of the provisions made by
the will for Mrs. Mary W. Achter and Mrs. Emma S. Drury,
in case we shall be satisfied that such enlargement would not
be against the wishes of Mr. Fayerweather.
"Third, We give to Lucy J. Beardsley, wife of Morris B.
Beardsley, $100,000.
"We do this because of Mr. Fayerweather's letter written
to Mr. Vaughan and Mr. F. B. Myrick. If accepted, this gift
is in discharge of any claim under that letter."
Then, after making gifts of several sums to individuals,
hospitals and colleges (some being those named in the will
of Mr. Fayerweather, and others not so mentioned), the deed
closes with these words:
"We execute this instrument, recognizing that there is
pending a contest in proceedings for the probate of Mr. Fayerweather's will, and recognizing further that if such contest
shall not prevail, a question may be made about our legal
rights as devisees and legatees. . . . Our object is each
for himself to give away whatever may come to us as residuary
devisees and legatees under Mr. Fayerweather's will."
Subsequently, and on March 5, the executors, as residuary
legatees, entered into an agreement with the contestants by
which the amounts coming to them were increased, and thereupon the contestants executed the following paper:
"In consideration of the instrument of even date herewith
executed by Justus L. Bulkley, Thomas G. Ritch and Henry
B. Vaughan, residuary devisees and legatees under the will,
meaning thereby the original will and subsequent codicils of
Daniel B. Fayerweather, . . . we, the undersigned, being

the widow and all of the next of kin of the said Daniel B.
Fayerweather, do hereby severally agree for ourselves, our,
and each of our heirs, executors and administrators, as follows:
"1. All objections to the probate of the will and four
codicils of the late Daniel B. Fayerweather, offered for probate
to the Surrogate of the county of New York, are hereby withdrawn, and we consent to the probate of the same.
"2. No suit shall hereafter be brought for the construction
of the said will and codicils or either of them, or to set aside
the will and codicils or either of them, and we further agree
not to make any claim upon the said Justus L. Bulkley,
Thomas G. Ritch and Henry B. Vaughan or either of them,
or against their heirs or personal representatives, or either
against them, the said Bulkley, Ritch and Vaughan, as executors, or as residuary legatees, other than for amounts left to
us by the will and codicils aforesaid, and the deed of gift
executed by the said Bulkley, Ritch and Vaughan on the
24th day of February, 1891, and the instrument dated on the
5th day of March, 1891.
"3.Upon the payment to the undersigned, respectively,
of the several amounts mentioned in said deed of gift and
said instrument, we will severally execute a general release
of all claims, except those arising under the will and codicils,
both to the executors and to the donees mentioned in
the deed of gift, dated on the 24th day of February, 1891,
and to the said Bulkley, Ritch and Vaughan individually."
On March 24, 1891, the codicils were admitted to probate
on written consent signed by the attorneys for the parties to
the contest. On June 12, 1891, the widow executed the
following release:
"Know ye, that I, Lucy Fayerweather, widow of Daniel B.
Fayerweather, of the City of New York, for and in consideration of the sum of two hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars, lawful money of the United States, to me in hand paid

tioned in the agreement dated March 5th, 1891, and made
pursuant to the deed of gift above referred to."
Releases similar in form were executed by the other three
contestants, the nieces and next of kin.
In January, 1893, five of the colleges named in article 9 of
the will brought suit in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York against the executors of Mr. Fayerweather's will,
the executors of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather (who had died
since the release), the nieces, the donees in the deed of gift,
and all the colleges not joined as plaintiffs. The contention
of the plaintiffs was that the codicil which gave the residue
of the estate to the three executors absolutely was made in
pursuance of an agreement that they should take that residue
in trust for the colleges mentioned in the will and distribute
it among them. The complaint set forth the will and codicils,
their admission to probate and the issue of letters testamentary,
and averred that the value of the estate left by the testator
was upwards of $6,000,000 and the residuary estate more than
$3,000,000. It alleged that the intention of the testator was
to devote the principal part of his estate to the several institutions mentioned, and that the proceedings taken by him
were under the advice of counsel and for the purpose of carrying into effect that intention, and upon a promise and assurance from the executors that they would dispose of the residuary estate accordingly; it averred also the fact of a contest
in respect to the probate of the will and codicils, a settlement
with the contestants in consideration of the payment of
$310,000 and the execution of releases by them. The prayer
was that it be adjudged and decreed that the residuary estate
was devised by the testator and received by the executors in
trust for the purposes set forth, that they be required to apply
that estate to those purposes, and, also, "that the ultimate
rights of the plaintiffs as between them and each .of them and
every of the other defendants herein be determined by the
judgment in this action in accordance with the allegations of
this complaint and the prayer hereinbefore contained."

FAYERWEATHER v. RITCH.
195 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

The donees in the deed of gift answered, asserting the validity
of that deed, and praying that its provisions be carried out.
The widow's executors and the nieces also appeared and
filed an answer and counterclaim, in which they alleged that
the agreement which the suit was brought to enforce was a
secret trust to evade the New York statute by giving more
than half to the several institutions, that the releases were
obtained from them by concealment and fraud, and therefore
of no obligation; and prayed for judgment, among other
things"3d. That it be adjudged that the said settlements and
releases made with or obtained from the said Lucy Fayerweather, Mary W. Achter and Emma S. Fayerweather, respectively, were and are each fraudulent and void, and that
the same be set aside, upon such terms as may be just and
equitable, and that the sums paid for the same to said releasors or their attorneys, respectively, with the interest
thereon, including the increased payments to said Lucy Fayerweather on her annuity, be charged against or allowed upon
the sums payable to them respectively under the judgment
herein, or be otherwise provided or accounted for as may be
according to equity.
"4th. That it be adjudged that the said deed of gift, dated
February 24th, 1890 (Exhibit F), was and is fraudulent and
void, and that the said Thomas G. Ritch, Justus L. Bulkley
and Henry B. Vaughan be enjoined and restrained from further
disturbing the said residuary estate, or any part thereof, under
the same, except to continue the payment of the said annuity
to said Anner Amelia Reynolds, as aforesaid.
"5th. That the said defendants Ritch, Bulkley and Vaughan
may be required to account for the moneys and property received by them from the estate of the said Daniel B. Fayerweather under said last will and testament and codicils or
otherwise, and for the application thereof, and to pay over
the said moneys and property remaining in their hands among
the parties to this action according to their several and re-

spective rights thereto, as the same may be adjudged in this
action.
"6th. That the ultimate rights of the parties to this action
in the estate of the said Daniel B. Fayerweather be determined and enforced by the judgment in this action, in accordance with the allegations of this answer and the foregoing
prayers for relief therein.
"7th. That these defendants may have such other and
further relief herein as may be just and equitable, with their
costs herein, to be paid as the court may direct."
The decree of the Supreme Court at special term, entered
on December 28, 1894, adjudged and decreed that the residuary
estate passed to the executors in trust for the colleges, named
in the ninth paragraph of the will; that the executors and
trustees be restrained and enjoined from distributing the residuary estate, or any part thereof under the deed of gift, and
that the plaintiffs and certain of the defendants (including
therein the executors of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather and
two of the nieces) recover from the trustees their costs, together with extra allowances to be paid out of the trust funds.
There was no formal finding of facts and no mention made in
the decree of the specific claim of the executors of Mrs. Fayerweather's will and the nieces that the releases were fraudulently
obtained. An appeal was taken by the defendants to the
general term of the Supreme Court, which on December 18,
1895, affirmed the judgment. 91 Hun, 509. A further appeal
was taken to the Court of Appeals, which on January 19, 1897,
affirmed the judgment of the general term. 151 N. Y. 282.
On January 28, 1897, a motion was made in the Court of Appeals to amend the remittitur so as to direct the Justice of the
Supreme Court, before whom the action was tried at special
term, to consider the evidence given before him at the trial
concerning the releases and to determine whether the said
releases were valid and binding or invalid and void, which
motion was on March 9, 1897, denied.
After these proceedings in the state court two of the nieces

and next of kin, being citizens of the State of Iowa, instituted
this suit in the Circuit Court of the United States, making
defendants substantially all the parties to the suit in the state
court, the one or two omissions in no way affecting the question before us. Subsequently the remaining executor, one
having resigned, of the will of Mrs. Fayerweather filed a cross
bill, the allegations and the relief asked being similar to those
in the original bill.
These bills-in addition to setting forth the will and codicils
executed by Mr. Fayerweather, the probate proceedings and
the releases by the widow and nieces, and alleging that these
letters were fraudulently obtained and not binding-averred
the bringing of the suit hereinbefore referred to in the Supreme Court of the State by the five colleges, annexing copies
of the pleadings, and alleged that "thereupon the issues so
joined, as well as others duly raised by the answers of the
several defendants, came on to be tried before said court, and
these complainants gave evidence tending to prove the allegations in their said answer and all of said allegations, and
thereupon it became and was the duty of said court to adjudge
and determine whether the releases therein described were
invalid, and whether these complainants were entitled to the
affirmative relief prayed in respect thereto;" and further,
that the defendants"Confederating and combining together and between theMselves to prevent the entry of any judgment upon an actual
determination of the invalidity of said releases so in issue, requested and induced the court to hold and decide that the
right of the respective parties to said property and residuary
estate did not require any consideration or decision of said
issues, and said court thereupon made and rendered its decision without considering, passing upon or including in judgment the said issues, and omitted to decide upon these complainants' right to the affirmative relief by said answer prayed
in respect to said releases.
"And thereupon there was filed and entered in said action

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

195 U. S.

a decision and judgment, a copy of which is hereto annexed,
which complainants pray may be referred to and taken as
part of this bill as if the same were herein set forth at length.
"Thereupon by appeals taken from said judgment, in which
appeals these complainants were respondents as well as appellants, said judgment was reviewed by the general term of
said Supreme Court, sitting as a court for the correction of
errors, and not exercising any original jurisdiction, and thereupon said court held and determined that the right of the
respective parties to said property and residuary estate did
require the consideration and decision of said issues, and
thereupon, being duly informed by the record that said issues
had not been in fact considered, passed upon or included in
said judgment, it became and was the duty of said court,
pursuant to due process of law, the law of the land and the
provisions of the Constitutions of the State of New York and
of the United States, to require and order that said issues
should be in fact considered, passed upon and included in
judgment by the trial court, and until that should be done
said court could not duly adjudge or determine whether any
error had been committed in such determination upon said
issues.
"Nevertheless said court at said general term did not so
require or order, but by various fictions of law imputed to said
trial term and court below that it had determined said issues
and had decided in favor of the plaintiffs in said action upon
such determination, contrary to the truth and fact, and thereupon pretended to adjudge and determine, as such court for
the correction of errors, that there was not sufficient preponderance of evidence to support the asserted invalidity of
said releases to render such imputed determination of said
trial court erroneous as matter of law, but that such imputed
determination was supported by evidence sufficient to relieve
the same from the assignment of error in so deciding.
"It was not competent for said general term to have exercised an original jurisdiction and to have adjudged said issues,

FAYERWEATHER v. RITCH.
195 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

and thereupon to have modified said judgment so as to include the actual determination thereof; and said general term
did not exercise such power, but confined its action wholly
to the consideration of errors in the record.
"Thereupon said judgment was by appeals taken from
the judgment of affirmance so rendered, in which appeals
these complainants were respondents as well as appellants,
and reviewed by the Court of Appeals of the State of New
York.
"Said court determined that these complainants had no
standing to be heard or to have their rights determined by
said Court of Appeals, because the limitations imposed by
statute upon the jurisdiction of said court precluded any inquiry into the facts, the proof of the merits of the said issues,
but that said court was bound by the formal record procured
as aforesaid, and by the fictions thereby adjudged as aforesaid, and bad no power to review the same.
"During the pendency of the appeals aforesaid the control
of the several courts below over said action and the trial thereof
and the correction of any injustice arising as aforesaid was
suspended, and upon the affirmance of said judgment of affirmance, by the statutes of the State of New York, any correction
of the injustice arising as aforesaid was placed beyond the
power of any court of said State, except as the Court of Appeals should, by its remittitur, confer power upon said subordinate courts to entertain and try the said issues.
"Thereupon these complainants duly made application to
said Court of Appeals so to frame its said remittitur as to
permit said subordinate courts to entertain and try the said
issues, which application said court denied."
To these bills the defendants filed pleas of res judicgta,
claiming that the controversy between the parties was finally
settled by the decision of the state court. These pleas were
accompanied by an answer denying the allegations of fraud.
The Circuit Court sustained the pleas and dismissed the bill
and cross bill on the ground that the cause of action set forth

according to law. The Circuit Court was free to decide this
case upon the merits according to its own convictions.
Comity deserves respect but it is not law. Mast, Foos & Co.
v. Stover Mfg. Co., 177 U. S. 489. The interlocutory decision
of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the injunction order
was not final and has not the weight of a decision of the case
and is-not res judicata or con trolling at final judgment. Keystone Iron Co. v. M11artin, 132 U. S. 93; 1 Freeman on Judgments, 4th ed., § 251; Pothier on Obligations, Pt. 4, c. 3, § 3,

The Circuit Court of Appeals has never passed on the questions of res judicata and due process of law now before this
court. The decision in Trustees of Amherst College v. Ritch
is not res judicata. The record shows that Judge Truax who
tried the case in the first instance did not consider the question of the validity of the releases, but decided that the
releasors had nothing to release. The question here is
the validity of the releases-hence the state court decision is
not res Judicata. Casparsz on Estoppel, 342; Fifield v. Edwards, 39 Michigan, 264; State v. Rusk, 23 Wisconsin, 643;

of the releases by Judge Truax estops them now from asserting that the question of the releases is res judicata. Hovey v.

Bigelow, 5th ed., 54; Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S.389; Davis
v. Cromwell, 68 Fed. Rep. 525. The issue as to the releases
was decided only by the General Term or Appellate Division
upon exceptions to a general decision. This is by a court
unknown to the Constitution for the trial of causes. See
the powers of the Appellate Division, Benedict v. Arnoux, 154
N. Y. 726; Snyder v. Seaman, 157 N. Y. 452; Story on Const.
§ 1761; Elliott's App. Pro. §§ 16, 17. This makes the plea
of res judicata bad on its face. 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. 103; Emmott

The decision of Judge Truax did not show that this issue
was decided. Bomeisler v. Forster, 154 N. Y. 237; Galle v.

The issue must be same or the question is not res judicata.
So in will cases. Gaines v. Hennen, 24 How. 553; Burt v.
Steinburger, 4 Cowen, 563. No power exists in the appellate
courts to find facts not found by the trial court. A judgment
affirmed on facts not found by the trial court is not due process

of law. Truesdale v. Burke, 145 N. Y. 616, 617; Smith v.

The decree in that case is an estoppel of record on the appellants to bring the present actions, and is conclusive not
only as to the matters litigated, but also upon those which
might have been litigated in that action. This concludes any

PAYERWEATAER v. RIT1C1.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTicE BREWER, after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
Our jurisdiction of this direct appeal from the decision of
the Circuit Court is invoked on the ground that the case involves the application of the Constitution of the United States.
The c6ntention is that by Article V of the amendments to
the Federal Constitution no person can "be deprived of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law;" that these
plaintiffs were entitled to large shares of the estate of Daniel
B. Fayerweather; that they were deprived of this property
by the judgment of the Circuit Court, which gave unwarranted effect to a judgment of the state courts; that this action
of the Circuit Court is not to be considered a mere error in the
progress of a trial, but a deprivation of property under the
forms of legal procedure. In Chicago, Burlington &c. Railroad v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, we held that a judgment of a
state court might be here reviewed if it operated to deprive
a party of his property without due process of law, and that
the fact that the parties were properly brought into court and
admitted to make defense was not absolutely conclusive upon
the question of due process. We said (p. 234):
"But a State may not, by any of its agencies, disregard the
prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its judicial authorities may keep within the letter of the statute prescribiig
forms of procedure in the courts and give the parties interested
the fullest opportunity to be heard, and yet it might be that
its final action would be inconsistent with that amendment.
In determining what is due process of law regard must be had
to substance, not to form. This court, referring to the Fourteenth Amendment, has said: 'Can a State make anything
due process of law which, by its own legislation, it chooses to
declare such? To affirm this is to hold that the prohibition
to the States is of no avail, or has no application where the
invasion of private rights is effected under the forms of state
legislation.' Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S.97, 102. The

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

same question could be propounded, and the same answer
should be made, in reference to judicial proceedings inconsistent with the requirement of due process of law. If compensation for private property taken for piiblic use is an
essential element of due process of law as ordained by the
Fourteenth Amendment, then the final judgment of a state
court, under the authority of which the property is in fact
taken, is to be deemed the act of the State within the meaning of that amendment."
And again (pp. 236, 237):
"The mere form of the proceeding instituted against the
owner, even if he be admitted to defend, cannot convert the
process used into due process of law, if the necessary result
be to deprive him of his property without compensation."
If a judgment of a state court can be reviewed by this court
on error upon the ground that, although the forms of law were
observed, it necessarily operated to wrongfully deprive a party
of his property (as indicated by the decision just referred to)
a judgment of the Circuit Court of the United States, claimed
to give such unwarranted effect to a decision of a state court
as to accomplish the same result, may also be considered as
presenting the question how far it can be sustained in the view
of the prohibitory language of the Fifth Amendment, and thus
involve the application of the Constitution. It is said that
the right of these plaintiffs to share in the estate of Daniel
B. Fayerweather is undoubted, unless destroyed by the releases they executed; that the fundamental question presented
in the trial court of the State was the validity of those releases;
that notwithstanding this that court came to its conclusion
and rendered its judgment without any determination thereof;
that the appellate courts wrongfully assumed that the trial
court had decided the question, and rendered their judgments
upon that assumption, so that the necessary result of the
proceedings in the state courts was a deprivation of the right
of the plaintiffs to a share of the estate, without any finding
of the vital fact which alone could destroy their right. The

FAYERWEATHER v. RIFCH.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

contention is not that the state courts erred in their finding
in respect to this fact, but that there never was any finding.
Such decision of the state courts, made without any finding
of the fundamental fact, was accepted in the Circuit Court of
the United States as a conclusive determination of the fact.
Although these plaintiffs were parties to the proceedings in
the state courts and presented their claim of right, if it be true
that the necessary result of the course of procedure in those
courts was a denial of their rights-a taking away and depriving them of their property without any judicial determination of the fact upon which alone such deprivation could
be justified-a case is presented coming directly within the
decision in 166 U. S. supra. Giving effect in the Circuit Court
to the state judgment does not change the character of the
question. It is simply adding the force of a new determination to one wrongfully obtained, and adding it upon no new
facts. Whether the contention of the plaintiffs in respect
to the character of the state proceedings can be sustained or
not is a question upon the merits and does not determine the
matter of jurisdiction. That depends upon whether there is
presented a bona fide and reasonable question of the wrongful character of the proceedings in the state courts and the
necessary result therefrom. We are of opinion that the jurisdiction of this court must be sustained.
We pass, therefore, to consider the merits of the case.
Private right and public welfare unite in demanding that a
question once adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction
shall, except in direct proceedings to review, be considered as
finally settled and conclusive upon the parties. Interest reipublice ut sit finis litium. But in order to make this finality
rightful it should appear that the question was distinctly
put in issue; that the parties presented their evidence, or
at least had an opportunity to present it, and that the
question was decided. Cases of an alleged prior adjudication have frequently been presented in this court and the
scope of a plea thereof fully determined. In the leading

OCTOBER TERAI, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

case of Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 352, we
said:
"In considering the operation of this judgment, it should
be borne in mind, as stated by counsel, that there is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar or estoppel
against the prosecution of a second action upon the same
claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the same parties upon a different claim or cause
of action. In the former case, the judgment, if rendered upon
the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action.
It is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to
every matter which was offered and received to sustain or
defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible
matter which might have been offered for that purpose.
Thus, for example, a judgment rendered upon a promissory
note is conclusive as to the validity of the instrument and the
amount due upon it, although it be subsequently alleged that
perfect defenses actually existed, of which no proof was offered,
such as forgery, want of consideration, or payment. If such
defenses were not presented in the action, and established by
competent evidence, the subsequent allegation of their existence is of no legal consequence. The judgment is as conclusive, so far as future proceedings at law are concerned, as
though the defenses never existed. The language, therefore,
which is so often used, that a judgment estops not only as to
every ground of recovery or defense actually presented in the
action,, but also as to every ground which might have been
presented, is strictly accurate, when applied to the demand
or claim in controversy. Such demand or claim, having passed
into judgment, cannot again be brought into litigation between the parties in proceedings at law upon any ground
whatever."

The state court was one of competent jurisdiction, and the
present contestants were before that court, taking part in the
litigation. The validity 6f the releases was put in issue by
the pleadings, and no judgment could properly have been
rendered without a determination of that question. The colleges sought to enforce a secret trust, but the property covered
by the trust, together with that passing under the ninth article
of the will, was the bulk of the estate-far more than half.
Such a disposition of the testator's property was in contravention of the laws of New York. They who would take the
estate in case of intestacy had a right to object to the enforcement of the trust. Only on condition that they waived their
objections and released could it be sustained. The judgment
enforced it. It therefore practically determined that the releases were valid, and decided against the contention of these
plaintiffs that they were fraudulent and void. All this is
evident from a perusal of the pleadings. The appellants" concede this and rest their .claim in the Federal court partly upon
that basis. Thus, in their brief it is said:
"The issues so joined came on to be tried in the state Supreme Court; these complainants gave evidence tending to
prove their allegations, and thereupon-it became the duty of
the court to adjudge whether the releases which they assailed
were invalid and whether they were entitled to the affirmative
relief prayed. The issues so tendered were necessary to be
determined before any valid judgment upon those issues could
be given pursuant to due process of law, the law of the land
and the provisions of the Constitution of the United States."
The case was tried by the court without a jury. No special

findings of fact were made. According to testimony given on
the trial of this case in the Circuit Court the omission to make
special findings was with the acquiescence (if not at the instance) of all the counsel appearing in the state court. The
decree adjudged that the residuary estate was held -intrust
for the colleges named in the ninth article of the will, enjoined
the residuary legatees from distributing any portion of that
estate under the deed of gift, and directed that it be paid over
to the respective colleges. The ordinary rule in respect to a
judgment without any special findings is that it, like a general
verdict of a jury, is tantamount to a finding in favor of the
successful party of all the facts necessary to sustain the judgment. In the general term, on the appeal taken to it, two
opinions were filed. One by Judge Follett, in which Judge
Parker concurred, and one by the presiding judge, Van Brunt.
Judge Follett, after stating that the executors of the testator's
widow and two of his heirs at law and next of kin sought to
have the residuary clause declared invalid, under chap. 360 of
the Laws of 1860, said:
"The difficulty with their contention is that the widow and
heirs released all of their interest in the estate, for valuable
considerations paid to them.

.

.

.

It is urged that these

releases were procured by fraud and undue influences. There
is no evidence in the record justifying this contention. The
terms of settlement were agreed on during the controversy in
the surrogate's court over the probate of the will and codicils,
and the widow and heirs were represented in that controversy, and in the settlement, by distinguished counsel and
acted under their advice.

.

.

.

If the person entitled to

contest a will, or some one or more of its provisions, voluntarily
and for a valuable consideration, received after the testator's
death, with full knowledge of the invalidity of the will, divests
himself of all interest in the property attempted to be disposed of by it, he cannot impeach its validity."
Presiding Judge Van Brunt thus stated his conclusions:
"The testator left him surviving a widow, who was the only

person who could call into operation for her protection the
statute which we have quoted. The widow, however, has released to the executors all claims to the estate, which release
cannot be successfully attacked or set aside. There is consequently no person for whose benefit the statute can operate.
"No rights of heirs and next of kin have been infringed upon,
because the trust does not contravene any statute for their
benefit, and is not the subject of attack by them. If it were,
they have also executed a release of their interest in the estate
in the same manner as the widow.
"We have therefore the case of a trust established, which
would be valid as against all the world but for the statute in
favor of the widow, and the widow, having released all her
rights in the estate, how can her representatives claim the invalidity of a trust as to property in which she had no interest?"
The opinion in the Court of Appeals was delivered by
Judge Vann, and concurred in by all of the judges except
Chief Judge Andrews. In it it is said:
"Although the decision by the special term and the affirmance by the general term were general in form, necessarily
some facts were found by those courts, even if they are not
specified in the record. Otherwise the burden of deciding
questions of fact would be cast upon this court, which has
jurisdiction to decide only questions of law. We think that
the effect of a decision by the trial court without expressing
the facts found is the same as if there had been a general verdict rendered by a jury, and that the same presumptions arise
in its support.
"We are of the opinion, therefore, that where the decision
of the special term does not state the facts found, and the
judgment entered thereon has been affirmed by the general
term, upon an appeal to this court, all the facts, warranted
by the evidence and necessary to support the judgments below, are presumed to have been found. Hence, upon such an
appeal, we have no more control over the facts than we have

when specific findings are made by the special term and affirmed
by the general term. This conclusion takes the question as
to the fraud alleged to have been practiced by the residuary
legatees upon the widow and next of kin in procuring the releases out of the case, for it cannot be said on the record
before us that the evidence tending to show fraud is so irresistible as to make the omission to find fraud an error of law.
Assuming that there was evidence enough to warrant the inference of fraud, there was also ample evidence to warrant the
inference there was no fraud. A question of fact was thus
presented which is beyond our power of review."
Thus the Court of Appeals held in accord with the ordinary
ruling as to the effect of a judgment without findings. So it
has frequently decided. In Bartlett v. Goodrich, 153 N. Y.
421, 424, it said:
"The learned trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled
to recover, and the general term has affirmed the judgment.
There were no findings made as the result of the trial, but simply a brief statement of the ground of the decision. In this
condition of the record we must presume that all facts warranted by the evidence, and necessary to support the judgment, have been found. (Amherst College v. Ritch, 151 N. Y.
282.) The appeal, therefore, cannot prevail unless it appears,
as matter of law, that the learned trial judge was not warranted, upon any fair view of the evidence, in finding as he
did, that the deceased was, at the time of his.death, the equitable owner of the policies."

FAYERWEATHER v. RITCH.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

After the filing of its opinion an application made to the
Court of Appeals, as shown in the statement of facts, to amend
the remittitur so as to direct the trial court to find specifically
whether the releases were valid or not, was denied.
We have thus the case of a hearing in the trial court upon
issues which required a determination of the validity of these
releases as a condition of a judgment adverse to these plaintiffs; a judgment against them; an affirmance of the judgment
by the general term of the Supreme Court, with an opinion
declaring that there was in the record no evidence justifying
the claim that these releases were fraudulently obtained and
void; and a further affirmance by the Court of Appeals, accompanied by an opinion declaring that upon the state of the
record it was to be presumed that the validity of the releases
had been affirmatively found, and also that there was sufficient evidence to sustain stich a finding, followed by a refusal
to send the question of the validity of the releases back to the
trial court for consideration. Notwithstanding all this, apparent upon the face of the record, the plaintiffs insist that the
validity of the releases was never determined by any of the
state courts, and that the final judgment of affirmance by the
Court of Appeals was based upon the presumption of a determination which was never in fact made.
Upon what is this contention based? First, the silence of
the judgment, which contains no findings to indicate upon
what it is based; second, a memorandum of decision filed by
the trial judge, in which he states that "the grounds upon
which the issues have been decided are" a promise of the
executors that if made residuary legatees they would distribute the residuary estate among the colleges named in the
ninth article, and *that the testator made them residuary
legatees in reliance thereupon ; third, the opinion of the trial
judge, in which he discusses at some length and with citation
of authorities the validity of the secret trust and the testimony
by which it was established, and then, without in terms passing upon the contention respecting the releases, states "the

view that I have taken of the facts and the law of this case
renders it unnecessary for me to consider the very interesting
questions of law propounded by the learned counsel for the
defendants Reynolds, Achter and Fayerweather;" and finally
the testimony of the trial judge, given on the hearing in this
case some six years after his decision in the state court, to the
effect that in deciding the case he did not consider the question of the validity of the releases.
It is undoubtedly true that in some cases evidence may be
introduced outside the record to show what particular question was tried and determined in the former suit. Washington, Alexandria & Georgetown Steam-Packet Company v. Sickles,
24 How. 333, 344; Packet Co. v. Sickles, 5 Wall. 580, 592;
Russell v. Plaee, 94 U. S. 606, 608. But it does not follow that
testimony of every kind is admissible for that purpose. In
Packet Company v. Sickles, supra, although it was held that
"in cases where the record itself does not show that the matter
was necessarily and directly foumd by the jury, evidence aliunde
consistent with the record may be received to prove the fact,"
yet it appearing that some of the jurors on the former trial
were permitted to testify as to the particular ground upon
which they found their verdict, it was said (p. 593):
"But it is proper to say that the secret deliberations of the
jury, or grounds of their proceedings while engaged in making
up their verdict, are not competent or admissible evidence of
the issues or finding. The jurors oftentimes, though they may
concur in the result, differ as to the grounds or reasons upon
which they arrive at it.
"The evidence should be confined to the points in controversy on the former trial, to the testimony given by the
parties,' and to the questions submitted to the jury for their
consideration, and then the record furnishes the only proper
proof of the verdict."

Tested by the rule thus laid down the testimony of the trial

judge, given six years after the case had been disposed of, in
respect to the matters he considered and passed upon, was
obviously incompetent. True, the reasoning of the court for
the rule is not wholly applicable, for as the case was tried before a single judge there were not two or more minds coming
by different processes to the same result. Nevertheless no
testimony should be received except of open and tangible
facts-matters which are susceptible of evidence on both sides.
A judgment is a solemn record. Parties have a right to rely
upon it. It should not lightly be disturbed, and ought never
to be overthrown or limited by the oral testimony of a judge or
juror of what he had in mind at the time of the decision. Undoubtedly, when the pleadings are general, as in a case of the
common counts, evidence may be given of the testimony which
was introduced on the trial, for that may disclose what must
have been considered and determined. And where the evidence is that testimony was offered at the prior trial upon
several distinct issues, the decision of any one of which would
justify the verdict or judgment, then the conclusion must be
that the prior decision is not an adjudication upon any particular issue or issues; and the plea of res judicatamust fail.
Putting one side the oral testimony of the trial judge, there
is nothing in the other matters specified to disturb the conclusion which follows from an examination of the record that
the validity of the releases was actually determined. Of
course, the omission of special findings means nothing, for
the judgment implies a finding of all necessary facts. The
memorandum of decision naturally states the grounds for
arriving at a conclusion concerning the respective claims of the
colleges named in the ninth clause and the beneficiaries of the
deed of gift, for that was the controversy between those parties and indeed the primary controversy presented by the
pleadings. The declaration in the opinion, that the conclusion reached upon the matters discussed rendered it unnecessary to consider the questions of law propounded by the
counsel for these plaintiffs, must be read in the light of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

prior statement therein that the widow and next of kin were
demanding that the releases executed by them be set aside
and they be given the residuary estate, and the further fact
that whether the releases were fraudulently obtained and void
was a question of fact rather than of law. Evidently the
opinion proceeded and the conclusion was reached on the
assumption that there was no sufficient testimony to invalidate
the releases.
Further, the entire record of the case was taken on appeal
to the general term. That court had before it for consideration all the evidence which was presented to the trial court;
and, as we have seen, declared in its opinion that there was no
evidence justifying the contention that the releases were procured by fraud and undue influence. While this was not
stated in the form of a special finding it discloses the conclusion of the court from the evidence. We cannot hold that it
was not authorized to pass upon this question, for its conclusion was sustained by the Court of Appeals, which in its
opinion also referred to the question. Finally, by the motion
to amend its remittitur, the attention of the Court of Appeals
was specifically called to these very matters which are now
urged as showing a failure on the part of the lower courts to
determine the question of the validity of the releases, and it
refused to make any order which would permit a further consideration. Nothing can be clearer from this record than that
the question of the validity of the releases was not only before
the state courts, but was considered and determined by them,
and the regularity of the procedure was sustained by the highest court of the State. The question was, as affirmed by counsel for these appellants, put in issue by the pleadings, and its
determination was a necessary prerequisite to an adverse judgment. It was referred to by all the courts in their opinions,
was affirmatively decided by the general term, its decision sustained by the Court of Appeals and reaffirmed by that court,
by a refusal to amend its remittitur.
Under these circumstances the pleas of res judicata were

PATTERSON v. HEWITT.
APPAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

NEW MEXICO.
No. 23. Argued October 25, 26,190-Decided November 28, 1904.

The owners of a mining claim in New Mexico transferred their interests to
one of their number as trustee, who was to retransfer to each one contributing his share of development expenses for a year, a'one-eighth interest. Plaintiff, one of the parties, contributed his share and demanded
a deed which th6 trustee refused to give. Plaintiff made no further demand and did not contribute any more to the expenses, but the trustee
and some of the other owners continued to develop the claim, and finally
succeeded in finding a valuable body of ore. Eight years after the former
demand plaintiff commenced an action in equity to enforce the original
trust. There is a statute in New Mexico to the effect that no action for
the recovery of lands shall be commenced after a lapse of ten years, etc.
Held:
That persons having claims to mining property in the course of development are bound to the utmost diligence in enforcing them, and in such
cases the doctrine of laches is relentlessly enforced.
That while in actions at law, courts are bound by the literalism of statutes,
in equity the question of unreasonable delay within the statutory limitation is still open, and that even where a statute of limitations exists and
has been made applicable in general terms to suits in equity, defendant
may avail of the laches of complainant, notwithstanding the time fixed
by the statute has not expired.
Tl.at the refusal by a trustee of a demand to execute a deed in alleged pursuance of a trust agreement is a repudiation of the trust and opens the
door to the defense of laches.
That a delay of eight years during which large sums of money have been
spent in developing a mining property is inexcusable laches.
