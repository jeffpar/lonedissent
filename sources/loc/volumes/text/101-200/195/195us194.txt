OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Syllabus.

195 U. S.

In the case under consideration defendants purchased, under
the instructions of the plaintiff, certain stocks and opened an
account with him, charging him with commission and interest,
and crediting him with amounts received as margins. Subsequently, and without the knowledge of the plaintiff, they
sold these stocks, and thereby converted them to their own
use. Without going into the details of the facts, it is evident
that the plaintiff might have sued them in an action on contract, charging them with the money advanced and with the
value of the stock; or in an action of trover based upon their
conversion. For reasons above given, we do not think that
his election to sue in tort deprived his debt of its provable
character, and that as there is no evidence that the frauds
perpetrated by the defendants were committed by them in an
official or fiduciary capacity, plaintiff's claim against them was
discharged by the proceedings in bankruptcy.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is therefore
reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
Nos. 3,4, 5. Argued November 7, 1903.-Reargued October 17, 1904.-Decided November 7, 194.
Malicious mischief is a familiar and proper subject for legislative repression
as are also combinations for the purpose of inflicting it, and liberty to
combine to inflict such mischief, even upon such intangibles as business
or reputation, is not among the rights which the Fourteenth Amendment
was intended to protect.
Section 4466a, Wisconsin Statutes of 1898, prohibiting combinations for
the purpose of willfully or maliciously injuring another in his reputation,

trade, business or profession, is not in conflict with the Fourteenth
Amendment so far as the section applies to such a combination made
from solely malevolent motives.

THE facts, which involved the constitutionality of. ยง 4466a
of the statutes of Wisconsin, 1898, are stated in the opinion
of the court.
Mr. W. H. Timlin and Mr. Goerge D. Van Dyke for plaintiffs in error in Nos. 3 and 4:
N
Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution contains an express restriction against the State,
through any of its governmental agencies, executive, legislative
or judicial, depriving any person of liberty or pkoperty without
due process of law. The words "liberty or property" not having been defined in the Constitution it is for the court to determine their scope and meaning according to the usual rules of
construction, including of course the meaning which has been
given to these words or either of them in judicial decisions, or
juristic writings.
The constitutionality of ยง 4466a must be determined in this
court upon the construction given to it by the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin, Machine Co. v. Gage, 100 U. S. 676, that it
prohibits intentional joint action of any kind intended to cause
loss of trade to another. This includes codperation in trade
competition. Thus construed the statute is unconstitutional.
If the state court had limited "injury" in this penal statute
to mean, "an infraction of some legal right," Penna. R. R. Co.
v. Marchant, 119 Pa. St. 541, or had excepted the acts of cooperation in trade competition, different questions might arise.
It did not do so. It treated loss of customers as an "injury."
Because this is the only injury claimed. A criminal statute
cannot be used as a drag net to ensnare the guilty and the
innocent, leaving the latter to extricate themselves as they
can. Trade Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82; Montana Co. v. St.
Louis Co., 152 U. S.170, citing Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 183;

The statute, as construed, subjects to criminal prosecution
those who enter into an ordinary partnership to compete in
trade and win away customers from another, at least provided
a jury find their intentions in doing so to be malicious, and it
makes criminal many agreements in trade competition approved and found to be a lawful exercise of the right of liberty
to contract by many other eminent courts such as the agreements held valid in NiagaraFire Ins. Co. v. Cornell, 110 Fed.

Even this court is able to say from the information alone
(without here considering the plea) as the state court said in
the habeas corpus case, that there could be no competitive
purpose served by the acts charged against the accused. The
accused cannot by law be deprived of their liberty to contract,
collectively or individually, with whom, at what rates and
upon what terms they choose, including terms which prohibit
their customer from dealing with their competitor. Coffeyville &c. Co. v. Perry, 76 Pac. Rep. (Kan.) 848; State ex rel.

which is a legal right, but by reason of the strikers or boycotters

MR. JUSTicE HOzmES delivered the opinion of the court.
These are three writs of error to the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin, brought to set aside convictions and sentences of
the plaintiffs in error, the defendants below, upon informations
filed by the District Attorney. 113 Wisconsin, 419. The
ground of the writs is that the proceedings violated the rights
of the plaintiffs in error under the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. The informations were
brought under the Wisconsin statutes of 1898, ยง 4466a, which
impose imprisonment or fine on "any two or more persons who
shall combine . . . for the purpose of wilfully or maliciously injuring another in his reputation, trade, business or
profession by any means whatever," etc. The plaintiffs in
error were severally charged with unlawfully combining to-

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

gether with the intent of willfully and maliciously injuring The
Journal Company, a corporation, and certain persons named,
stockholders and officers of the company, in their trade and
business. It was alleged that the company was publisher of a
newspaper in Milwaukee and had notified an increase of about
twenty-five per cent in its charges for advertising, and that
thereupon the plaintiffs in error, who were managers of other
newspapers in the same place, in pursuance of their combination and with the intent of willfully, maliciously and unlawfully
injuring The Journal Company and the others named, agreed
as follows: If any person should agree to pay the increased
rate to The Journal Company, then he should not be permitted
to advertise in any of the other three newspapers except at a
corresponding increase of rate; but if he should refuse to pay
The Journal Company the increased rate, then he should be
allowed to advertise in any of the other three papers at the
rate previously charged. It was alleged that this conspiracy
was carried out and that much damage to the business of The
Journal Company ensued.
The defendant Hoyt demurred to this information, setting
up the Fourteenth Amendment. Aikens and Huegin filed
pleas which admitted the combination and intent of injuring
The Journal Company and the resulting damage but alleged
that the combination was entered into in trade competition
and that the parties had the right to make it under the Fourteenth Amendment. The State demurred to the pleas. The
demurrer of Hoyt was overruled; those of the State were sustained. The defendants were sentenced and the judgment
of the trial court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
State on the authority of an earlier decision between the same
parties, reported in 110 Wisconsin, 189.
The statute, it will be observed, punishes combining for the
purpose of willfully or maliciously injuring another in his business. If it should be construed literally, the word "'willfully"
would embrace all injuries intended to follow from the parties'
acts, although they were intended only as the necessary means

AIK9NS v. WISCONSIN.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to ulterior gain for the parties themselves. Taken in that way
the word would hit making a new partnership, if it was intended thereby to hurt some one else's business by competition.
We shall not consider whether that branch of the statute, so
construed, could be sustained and express no opinion about it.
The Supreme Court of Wisconsin has intimated that a narrower
interpretation will be adopted, and in the present case we have
to deal only with the other branch, depending on the word
"maliciously," as we shall explain in a moment. The last
quoted word we must take as intended to add something to
the word "willfully," and we can do so only by taking it in its
true sense. We interpret "maliciously injuring" to import doing a harm malevolently for the sake of the harm as an end
in itself, and not merely as a means to some further end legitimately desired. Otherwise the phrase would be tautologous,
since a willful injury is malicious in the sense familiar to declarations and indictments, where indeed the word means no
more than foreseen, or even less than that. A death is caused
of malice aforethought if, under the circumstances known to
the actor, the probability of its ensuing from the act done is
great and manifest according to common experience. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 138 Massachusetts, 165, 178; 1 East P. C.
262. See also Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, 23 Q. B. D.
598, 613.
The informations alleged a combination for the purpose of
willfully and maliciously injuring others, and therefore brought
the case within the latter branch of the statute, if there are
two and if "or" in the act is not taken to mean "and." Itis
true that the plan is set forth, and some argument was spent
on whether that plan might or might not be an instrument of
ultimate gain.' But while that question may have been open
when the state court was discussing the evidence warranting
a commitment, in 110 Wisconsin, 189, none such is open here.
The malevolent purpose is alleged, it is admitted by the demurrer, it is not sufficiently denied by the pleas, whatever we
may conjecture would have been done if counsel had had this

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

decision before them. A purely malevolent act may be done
even in trade competition.
We come then to the question whether there is any constitutional objection to so much of the act as applies to this
case. It has been thought by other courts as well as the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin that such a combination followed
by damage would be actionable even at common law. It has
been considered that, prima facie, the intentional infliction of
temporal damage is a cause of action, which, as a matter of
substantive law, whatever may be the form of pleading, requires a justification if the defendant is to escape. Mogul
Steamship Co. v. McGregor, 23 Q. B. D. 598, 613; S. C., [1892]
A. C. 25. If this is the correct mode of approach it is obvious
that justifications may vary in extent according to the principle of policy upon which they are founded, and that while
some, for instance, at common law, those affecting the use of
land, are absolute, Bradford v. Pickens, [1895] A. C. 587,
others may depend upon the end for which the act is done.
Moran v. Dunphy, 177 Massachusetts, 485, 487; Plant v.
Woods, 176 Massachusetts, 492; Squires v. Wason Manuf. Co.,
182 Massachusetts, 137, 140, 141. See cases cited in 62 L. R.
A. 673. It is no sufficient answer to this line of thought that
motives are not actionable and that the standards of the law
are external. That is true in determining what a man is bound
to foresee, but not necessarily in determining the extent to
which he can justify harm which he has foreseen. Quinn v.
Leathem, [1901] A. C. 495, 524.
Whether, at common law, combinations would make conduct actionable which would be lawful in a single person it is
unnecessary to consider. Quinn v. Leathem, [1901] A. C. 495.
We are aware too that a prevailing opinion in England makes
motives immaterial, although it is probable that in Allen v.
Flood, [1898] A. C. 1, 94, the jury were instructed, as in Temperton v. Russell, [1893] 1 Q. B. 715, 719, in such a way that
their finding of malice meant no more than that the defendant
had acted with foresight of the harm which he would inflict,

ATXNS v. WISCONSIN.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

as a means to an end. Quinn v. Leathem, [1901] A. C. 495, 514.
However these things may be, we have said enough to show
that there is no anomaly in a statute, at least, which punishes
a combination such as is charged here. It has been held that
even the free use of land by a single owner for purely malevolent purposes may be restricted constitutionally, although the
only immediate injury is to a neighboring land owner. Rideout
v. Knox, 148 Massachusetts, 368. Whether this decision was
right or not, when it comes to the freedom of the individual,
malicious mischief is a familiar and proper subject for legislative
repression. Commonwealth v. Walden, 3 Cush. 558. Still more
are combinations for the purpose of inflicting it. It would
be impossible to hold that the liberty to combine to inflict
such mischief, even upon such intangibles as business or reputation, was among the rights which the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to preserve. The statute was assumed to
be constitutional in Arthur v. Oakes, 63 Fed. Rep. 310, 325, 326.
But if all these general considerations be admitted, it is
urged nevertheless that the means intended to be used by this
particular combination were simply the abstinence from making contracts, that a man's right so to abstain cannot be infringed on the ground of motives, and further, that it carries
with it the right to communicate that intent to abstain to
others and to abstain in common with them. It is said that
if the statute extends to such a case it must be unconstitutional.. The fallacy of this argument lies in the assumption
that the statute stands no better than if directed against the.
pure nonfeasance of singly omitting to contract. The statute
is directed against a series of acts, and acts of several, the acts
of combining, with intent to do other acts. "The very plot
is an act in itself." Mulcahy v. The Queen, L. R. 3 H. L. 306,
317. But an act, which in itself is merely a voluntary muscular
contraction, derives all its character from the consequences
which will follow it under the circumstances in which it was
done. When the acts consist of making a combination calculated to cause temporal damage, the power to punish such

acts, when done maliciously, cannot be denied because they
are to be followed and worked out by conduct which might
have been lawful if not preceded by the acts. No conduct has
such an absolute privilege as to justify all possible schemes of
which it may be a part. The most innocent and constitutionally protected of acts or omissions may be made a step in
a criminal plot, and if it is a step in a plot neither its innocence
nor the Constitution is sufficient to prevent the punishment
of the plot by law.
It was urged farther that to make a right depend upon
motives is to make it depend upon the whim of a jury and to
deny the right. But it must be assumed that the constitutional tribunal does its duty and finds facts only because they
are proved. The power of the legislature to make the fact
of malice material we think sufficiently appears from what we
already have said.
Finally it is argued that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin
would hold that the statute extends to acts of which the
motives were mixed and which were done partly from disinterested malevolence and partly from a hope of gain. If so,
it is said, the statute would be open to all the objections at
which we have hinted in dealing with the word "willfully."
The Supreme Court did use some language which looked that
way, but we consider it to have decided that the statute would
be confined to combinations with intent to do wrongful harm.
110 Wisconsin, 193, 260. Thus limited, on whatever ground,
the statute would punish only combinations of a kind for
which no justification could be offered and those which were
taken out of the justification by the motive with which they
were made. We see no sufficient reason to believe that the
court will go farther or construe the act in such a way as to
raise questions which we need not go into here. Therefore it
is unnecessary to consider whether, on a more literal construction, the portion dealing with malicious intent could be
separated from that which deals with the purpose of merely
willful injury, and saved, even if the latter were held to go too

Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

dissenting.

Not being able to concur in the conclusion of the court that
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has affixed to
the statute of that State a much narrower meaning than the
text of the statute imports, and thinking, on the contrary,
that not only such text but the construction of the statute
adopted by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin operates to deprive the citizen of a lawful right to contract protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment, I dissent.

THOMAS v. BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE OHIO
STATE UNIVERSITY.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 43. Argued Iarch 3, 1904.-Decided November 14,1904.
Jurisdiction of a Circuit Court of the United States must appear affirmatively from distinct allegations, or facts clearly proven, and is not to be
established argumentatively or by mere inference and -when jurisdiction
depends upon diverse citizenship, absence of sufficient averments, or of
facts in the record, showing such diversity is fatal and the defect cannot
be waived by the parties, nor can consent confer jurisdiction.
For the purpose of suing and being sued in the Circuit Court of the United
States the members of a local corporation are conclusively presumed
to be citizens of the State by whose law it was created and in which
alone the corporate body has a legal existence.
While this court is not conclusively bound by the judgment of the highest
court of a State as to what is and is not w orporation of that State within
