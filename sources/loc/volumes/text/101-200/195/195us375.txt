Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

BALTIMORE SHIPBUILDING AND DRY DOCK COMPANY v. BALTIMORE.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND.
No. 39. Argued November 2,3, 1904.-Decided November 28,1904.

A State may tax different estates in land to the different parties thereto
and sell only the interest of the party making default.
A State may tax the interest of a company owning a dry dock in land
conveyed to it by the United States notwithstanding there is a condition
subsequent the nonfulfillment whereof would result in forfeiture and
reversion to the United States and the United States has a continuing
right to use the dry dock for certain purposes.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. E. P. Keech, Jr., and Mr. Leon E. Greenbaum, with
whom Mr. Archibald H. Taylor was on the brief, for plaintiff
in error:
Congress authorized the conveyance of the property to the Dry Dock Company on several conditions, and upon the
happening of any one of the contingencies the property, with
all its privileges and appurtenances, will revert to and become
the property of the United States. Any possible right of
state taxation would thereby be destroyed. For a description of such an estate and incidents see Nor. Pac. R. R. Co.
v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267.
While these interests or estates of the United States and of
plaintiff in error are not "property" in the sense of things
material, as land itself or a horse is, they are "property"
according to the more usual legal meaning of "a right or interest which a man has in lands and chattels to the exclusion
of others." Austin's Jurisprudence (Campbell's notes), vol. 2,
§ 1051; Bouvier's Law Dict. (1897), "Property," vol. 2, 780;
Anderson's Law Dict. (1889), "Property," 835.

All "property" is not of necessity taxed by the State of
Maryland. The provision of Art. I, § 15, Declaration of
Rights, is not violated by certain express exemptions. Buchanan v. County Commissioners, 47 Maryland, 286.
Certain classes of "property" and rights, highly valuable
in themselves, are not the subject of taxation at all. Baltimore City v. Johnson, 96 Maryland, 737, 746; Balto. &c. Turnpike Co. v. The Appeal Tax Court, Balto. Daily Rec., May 7,
1903.
A State has no power to tax the property of the United
States, including land in which the United States has an interest or estate. Maryland Code of Public General Laws,
Title, "Revenue and Taxes," sub-title, "Exemptions," art. 81,
§ 4 (as amended by act of 1897, Ch. 120).
This is but legislative recognition of a fundamental doctrine of our law. Black on Tax Titles, 1893, § 35; Cooley on
Taxation, 3d ed., 135; Howell v. State, 3 Gill. 14; McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheaton, 316; Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117
U. S. 151; Wis. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Price Co., 133 U. S. 496.
So as to any land in which the United States has any interest.
Carroll v. Safford, 3 How. 441; Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall.

Land of the United States lying within a State is not taxable
by the State. If such land has been bought or taken up by
an individual, it is not subject to state taxation, so long as
something remains to be done by the individual to perfect his
right to a patent from the United States. Kansas Pac. Ry.
Co. v. Prescott, 16 Wall. 603; Union Pac. R. R. Co. v. McShane,

GCracey, 94 U. S. 762; Colorado Co. v. Commissioners, 95 U. S.
589; Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Traill Co., 115 U. S. 600; Hussman v. Durham, 165 U. S. 147.
The assessment in this case is laid upon the land, as such,
and not upon the interest of the plaintiff in error therein.
Such an assessment, i. e., upon the land itself, without regard to the various estates of those having interests in it-is

BALTIMORE SHIPBUILDING CO. v. BALTIMORE. 377

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

the only form of assessment for which provision is made by
the statutes of the State of Maryland. §§ 145, 164, art. 4,
Code of Public Laws, amended by Baltimore City Charter,
Ch. 123, acts of 1898.
The Dry Dock Company's property is assessed, and the
resultant taxes are levied against and constitute a lien upon
it, and the payment of them is enforceable, if by no other
means, through a sale of the property, the res itself. Cooley
on Taxation, 3d ed., 721 et seq.; Baltimore v. Canton Company,
63 Maryland, 218, 234; Mayor v. Boyd, 64 Maryland, 10;
Cooper v. Holmes, 71 Maryland, 20, 30. As to this feature
see §§ 43-48, Baltimore City Charter.
The provision of § 48 is that after the conditions of the sale
have been complied with and the required formalities observed, "the purchaser shall have a good title to the property
sold."
A purchaser at a tax sale in Baltimore city, has the right to
demand, and, e converso, the city collector may offer for sale
only, a fee simple title to the land levied upon, free from conflicting rights, claims, interests and estates of other parties,
and free from all incumbrances, liens and conditions. Cooper
v. Holmes, 71 Maryland, 20; Cooley on Taxation, 3d ed., 960;

v. N. W. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 123 U. S. 747; Emery v. Boston
Terminal Co., 178 Massachusetts, 172.
If the assessment can only be made on the land and not on
the several estates therein this assessment is but a step in
the attempted taxation of property of the United States and
is necessarily void. Moriarty v. Boone County, 39 Iowa, 634.
A State may not tax the interest of a private party in lands
in which the United States also have an interest, without the
consent of the United States. Kansas Pac. Ry. Co. v. Prescott,

The land with the dry dock on it is a Federal agency, actually

The tract, of which the land is a part, was acquired by the
United States from its owners with the express and unconditional consent of the State, and Congress is vested with
exclusive legislative jurisdiction over it, and the State has no
legislative or other power over it, except as expressly permitted
by Congress. United States v. Cornell, 2 Mason, 60; Commonwealth v. Glary, 8 Massachusetts, 72; Fort Leavenworth
R. R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U. S. 525; Railroad Co. v. McGlenn,
114 U. S. 542; Bannon v. Burns, 30 Fed. Rep. 892; Martin
v. House, 39 Fed. Rep. 694.
Where the State's consent has been given upon condition,
and in certain cases falling under acts of Congress, conferring
special jurisdiction on the States, a limitation of the rule has
been permitted. See Acts of March 5, 1795, Rev. Stat. § 4662;
Act of March 5, 1903, 32 Stat. 1220; and see also Chauvenet v.
Commissioners, 3 Maryland, 259.
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, with whom Mr. W. Cabell Bruce was
on the brief, for defendants in error:
The interest of the Dock Company in the land and dry dock
is not exempt from assessment because under § 2 of the act
of Congress there is a possibility that said land and dry dock

BALTIMORE SHIPBUILDING CO. v. BALTIMORE.

may revert to, and become the absolute property of, the
United States. It is simply the conditional interest or estate
of the plaintiff in error in the land and dry dock which is
assessed and taxed. If it should ever become necessary for
the State or city to sell the property .for the non-payment of
taxes, nothing more could be sold than its conditional estate
in the land and the permanent improvements thereon, subject
to all of the rights of the United States therein. In Maryland
taxes are not levied on things, but on the owner of things; the
value of the things owned merely fixing the measure of the
owner's liability to contribute in taxes towards the support
of the government. Monticello Co. v. Baltimore, 90 Maryland, 425; Carstairsv. Cochran, 95 Maryland, 500; see art. 50,
Baltimore City Code; Mayor v. Whittington, 78 Maryland,
232. The decision of the state court is binding on this court.
Carstairsv. Cochran, 193 U. S. 10; Northern Pac. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 270.
The property has a situs within the territorial limits of
Baltimore, and plaintiff in error has been in full possession
and enjoyment of said property for over twenty-five years,
under a legal title, during that entire period, falling within the
definition of a "base fee," or a fee simple title defeasible upon
a condition subsequent. As such owner, its interest in said
property has been assessed for taxes. No attempt has been
made to assess or to tax the contingent interest of the United
States Government. The act of Congress in question, and the
deed executed by the Secretary of War in pursuance of said
act, made no attempt to exempt from taxation the interest
acquired by the dock company, and, by the imposition of the
tax, there manifestly has been no impairment of the efficiency
of the grant or the use and enjoyment of the property by the
grantee. Union Pacific R. R. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5.
Plaintiff in error being in possession and full enjoyment of
very valuable property, some cogent reason must be shown
by it why its said property should not bear its fair proportion
of taxation for the benefit of the state and city governments.

Nor is the dock company's interest in the property exempt
from taxation because the United States may use the dock
for the examination and repair of its vessels free of charge.

MR.

JusTIcE

HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to the Court of Appeals of the State
of Maryland, brought to reverse a judgment sustaining a tax
upon certain land. The plaintiff in error filed a petition and
appeal from an assessment by the appeal tax court of Baltimore in the Baltimore City Court, alleging that its land was
not subject to taxation, and, if subject, was taxed too high.
The City Court reduced the tax but held the land liable, and
its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 97 Maryland, 97. The land in question formerly belonged to the
United States, being part of the property known as Fort
McHenry, and is admitted not to have been taxable at that
time. Under an act of Congress of June 19, 1878, 20 Stat.
167, it was conveyed to the plaintiff in error on March 26, 1879.
By the terms of the deed, following the requirements of the
act, the consideration of the conveyance and the condition
upon which it was made was that the Dock Company should
construct a dry dock upon the land as specified, which it did,
and that it should "accord to the United States the right to
the use forever of the said dry dock at any time for the prompt
examination and repair of vessels belonging to the United
States free from chai'ge for docking and that if at any time the
property hereby conveyed shall be diverted to any other use

Opinion of the Court.

than that herein named or if the said dry dock shall be at any
time unfit for use for a period of six months or more, the
property hereby conveyed with all its privileges and appurtenances shall revert to and become the absolute property of
the United States." This condition is relied upon as still
keeping the land outside the taxing power of the State.
It is argued that the United States has such an interest in
the land as to prevent the tax, and also that the land is an
agency of the Government by the terms of the grant. It is
noted that this tax originally was levied upon the land, not
upon the Dock Company's interest, and although the language
of the final judgment was "the property concerned in the
appeal in this case" that is supposed to mean the same thing.
We will deal with the argument drawn from the last consideration first. It is true that commonly taxes on land create
a lien paramount to all interests, and that a tax sale often has
been said to extinguish all titles and to start a new one. Hefner v. Northwestern Life Ins. Co., 123 U. S.747, 751; Textor v.
Shipley, 86 Maryland, 424, 438; Emery v. Boston Terminal Co.,
178 Massachusetts, 172, 184. Perhaps it was absumed that
this always was the effect of tax sales in Northern Pacific Railroad v. Traill Co., 115 U. S.600. But it needs no argument
to show that a State may do less. It may tax a life estate
to one and a remainder to another, and sell only the interest
of the party making default. With regard to what the State
of Maryland has done and what are the purport and attempted
effect of the tax in this case, we follow the Court of Appeals.
That court treated the tax and the lien as going only to the
Dock Company's interest in the land, although probably by
an oversight it neglected to modify the judgment according
to its own suggestion so as to show the fact. That only the
company's interest was taxed is shown by the reduction of
the assessment on account of the condition. Of course it does
not matter what form of words the judgment employs, when
its meaning is thus declared by the court having the matter
under its control,

In the next place, as to the interest of the United States in
the land. This is a mere condition subsequent. There is no
easement or present right in rem. The obligation to keep up
the dock and to allow the United States to use it carries active
duties and is purely personal. The property is subject to
forfeiture, it is true, if the obligation is not fulfilled. But it is
only by forfeiture that the rights of the United States can be
enforced against the res. It would be a very harsh doctrine
that would deny the right of the States to tax lands because
of a mere possibility that they might lapse to the United States.
The contrary is the law. The condition cannot be extinguished by the State, but the fee is in the Dock Company, and
that can be taxed and, if necessary, sold, subject to the condition. See Northern Pacific Ry. v. Myers, 172 U. S. 589, 598;
Maish v. Arizona, 164 U. S. 599, 607-609; Central Pacific R. R.
v. Nevada, 182 U. S. 512, 525. The title of the Dock Company
was not inalienable, as that of the railroad was held to be in
Northern Pacific Ry. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267.
Finally, we are of opinion that the land is not exempt as an
agency of the United States. The Dock Company disclaimed
that position for itself as a corporation, but asserts it for the
land. The position is answered technically, perhaps, by what
we have said already. The United States has no present right
to the land but merely a personal claim against the corporation, reinforced by a condition. But, furthermore, it seems
to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a State, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it
is employed by the United States, even if the work for which
it is employed is important and takes much of its time. Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579; Railroad Company v.
Peniston, 18 Wall. 5.
Judgment affirmed.
