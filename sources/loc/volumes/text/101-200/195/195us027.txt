McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 301. Argued December 2, 1103.--Decided May 31,1904.

The judiciaryjis without authority to avoid an act of Congress lawfully
exerting the taxing _power,-even ina case where to the judicial mind it
seems that.Jongiess had, in putting such power in motion, abused its
lawful authority by levying a tax which was unwise or oppressive, or the
result of the enforcement of which might be to indirectly affect subjects
not within the powers delegated to Congress, nor can the judiciary inquire into the motive or purpose of Congress in adopting a statute levying an excise tax within its constitutional power.
While both the Fifth and Tenth Amendments qualify, in so far as they are
applicable, all the provisions of the Constitution, nothing in either of
them operates to take away the grant of power to tax conferred by the
Constitution upon Congress, and that power being unrestrained except
as limited by the Contitutionpongress may select the objects upon
which the tax shall be levied, and in exerting the power no want of due
process of law can possibly result, and the judiciary cannot usurp the
functions of the legislature in order to control that branch of the Government in exercising its lawful functions.
The manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine may. be prohibited
by a free government without a violation of fundamental rights.
There is such a distinction between natural butter artificially colored, and
oleomargarine artificially colored so as to cause it to look like butter
that the taxing of the latter and not the former cannot be avoided as
an arbitrary exertion of the taxing power of Congress without any basis
of classification, taxing one article and excluding another of the same
class.
The Oleomargarine Act of 1886, 24 Stat. 209, as amended by the act of
1902, 32 Stat. 93, imposing a tax of one quarter of one per cent on oleomargarine not artificially colored any shade of yellow so as to look like
butter and ten cents a pound if so colored, levies an excise tax and is not
unconstitutional as outside of the powers of Congress, or an interference
with the powers reserved to the States, nor can the judiciary declare the
tax void becauseitis toohigh nor because it amounts to a destruction of
the business of manufacturing oleomargarine, nor because it discriminates
against oleomargarine and in favoi of butter.
Where a manufacturer of oleomargarine uses as an ingredient butter artificially colored he thereby gives to the manufactured product artificial

coloration within the meaning of the Oleomargarine Act as amended
in 1902 and the product is subject to taxation at the rate of ten cents
per pound.

THE United States sued McCray for a statutory penalty of
$50, alleging that, being a licensed retail dealer in oleomargarine, he had, in violation of the acts of Congress, knowingly
purchased for resale a fifty-pound package of oleomargarine,
artificially colored to look like butter, to which there were
affixed internal revenue stamps at the rate of one-fourth of
a cent a pound, upon which the law required stamps at the
rate of ten cents per pound. The answer of McCray, whilst
admitting the purchase of the package stamped as alleged,
set up two defences.
First. It was averred that the oleomargarine in question
was made by a duly licensed manufacturer, the Ohio Butterine
Company, from a formula used by it in making a high grade
oleomargarine composed of " the following ingredients and
none other, in these proportions: oleo oil, 20 pounds; natural lard, 30 pounds; creamery butter, 50 pounds; milk and
cream, 30 pounds; common salt, 7 pounds." - It was asserted
that whilst it was true that the oleomargarine made from.the ingredients in question was of a yellow color, that this
result was not caused by artificial coloration, but was solely
occasioned by the fact that the butter which was bought in
open market and used in making the oleomargarine had a deep
yellow color imparted to it (the butter) by a substance known
as Wells-Richardson's improved butter color. This preparation, it was averred, was not injurious to health, and was
constantly used in the United States in the manufacture of
butter made from pure milk or cream, for the purpose of
imparting to it a deep yellow color. Averring that a yellow
color produced in oleomargarine by the employment of butter, as an ingredient, which was artificially colored, did not
amount to an artificial coloration of the oleomargarine within
the meaning of the statute, it was asserted that the tax of
one-fourth of a cent per pound was a compliance with the law.

Statement of the Case.

,Second. If the act of Congress imposing the tax, when
rightfully construed, required stamps at the rate of ten cents
per pound upon oleomargarine, colored as described in the
first defence, the act levying such tax was charged to be
repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. As a
foundation for this defence the answer contained the following averments:
Whilst butter made from pure milk and cream in the
spring season was of a deep yellow color, such butter when
made at all other seasons was of a pale yellow; that the
taste of consumers of butter in the United States required
all butter to possess the deep color naturally belonging to
butter made in the spring season, and hence it had come to
pass that substantially all butter manufactured for sale in
the United States, not made in the spring season and not
naturally of a deep yellow, was colored artificially so as to
cause it to have the deep yellow of spring butter. It was
alleged that this deep yellow coloration of natural butter was
universally produced by the use of either Wells-Richardson's
compound or some other coloring ingredient, which did not
change the taste of the butter, none of which were injurious
to health. Oleomargarine, it was alleged, derived its chief
value as an article of food as a substitute for butter, and
that growing out of the taste of the consumers, unless the
oleomargarine which was naturally white could be colored
yellow, to present the appearance of butter artificially colored, there was no demand for it, and its manufacture and
sale would be commercially impossible. It was then averred
that to impose upon the colored oleomargarine a tax of ten
cents per pound would burden it with such a charge as to
render it impossible to make and sell it in competition with
butter, and therefore the result of imposing a tax of ten cents
a pound on oleomargarine when artificially colored would
destroy the oleomargarine industry. From these averments
it was charged that if the law imposed the tax of ten cents
upon the oleomargarine in question the statute was repug-

nant to the Constitution, because it deprived the defendant
of his property without due process of law; because the
levy of such a burden was beyond the constitutional power
of Congress, since it was an unwarranted interference by
Congress "with the police powers reserved to the several
States and to the people of the United States by the Constitution of the United States;" and further, that said acts
of Congress were repugnant to the Constitution, since they
finally lodged in an executive officer the power to determine
what constituted artificial coloration of oleomargarine, and
therefore invested such officer with judicial authority; and,
finally, because the attempt by Congress to levy a tax at the
rate of ten cents a pound arbitrarily discriminated against
oleomargarine in favor of butter, to the extent of destroying
the oleomargarine industry for the benefit of the butter industry, and was, therefore, violative of " those fundamental
principles of equality and justice which are inherent in the
Constitution of the United States."
The Government demurred to the answer on the ground
that it stated no defence. The demurrer was sustained and
McCray electing to plead no further, the court found the
facts alleged in the petition to be true, and adjudged that
the Government recover "the sum of fifty dollars as a penalty and costs." Because of the questions arising under the
Constitution, the case was then brought directly to this court.

The provisions of this act, so far as they affect the internal commerce of a State, can, therefore, only be sustained
under the taxing power of Congress. While the act is called a
tax law it imposes a burden on a recognized article of commerce of the States. Schollenbergerv. Pennsylvania,171 U. S.

The tax is so large that it is evident that it was imposed,

A State, under the power to regulate its internal commerce,
can prohibit the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine.

Ohio, 183 U. S. 238, 246, but it cannot prohibit the sale of
oleomargarine manufactured in other States and offered for
sale in the course of interstate commerce. - Schollenberger v.
Pennsylvania,.171 U. S. 1, 21, 25. A$tate surely cannot indirectly prohibit interstate commerce in oleomargarine by taxing it to death. If a State should impose a tax upon a commercial commodity as property and the effect of such a tax, as to articles
brought from other States, was to destroy all opportunity to
sell the commodity, the law would be unconstitutional as interfering with interstate commerce even though the same
amount of tax should be laid on domestic manufactures as
property, and even though such a tax would only apply after
the "original package" of importation had been broken and
the contents exposed for sale. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall.

conferring the taxing power. Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537,

purports strictly to levy an excise tax, Patton v. Brady, 184
U. S. 608, 618, but an exaction made without regard to any
rule of apportionment is not authorized by law, Cooley's Pr.
Const. Law, 3d ed. P. 56, and does not come within the definitions of taxation. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 199; Oliver .

While the power to tax undoubtedly involves the power to

liberty and property of the individual and one of the inalienable privileges and immunities of every citizen of the United
States which are secured by the Constitution. Butchers'

The contention of the plaintiff does not limit the taxing
power of the Federal government but simply declares that in
the exercise of the taxing power Congress may not impose prohibitory taxes upon internal products based upon the fact that
a manufactured article resembles and competes with another
product which is not taxed; in other words, that it may not
destroy the property of one class of its citizens for the benefit
of another class.
Section 14 of the act conferring judicial power upon the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue is invalid. United States
v. Eaton, 144 U. S. 677, 688; United States v. Maid, 116 Fed.
Rep. 650; United States v. Blasingame, 116 Fed. Rep. 654.
In re Kollock, 165 U. S. 526, 533, distinguished.
According to the ruling of the Commissioner, the word "artificial" is made to include "natural," a word of opposite
meaning, for it is undisputed that the yellow color of palm
oil is a natural color, and the exception would be, not of
oleomargarine "free from artificial coloration" but of oleomargarine "free from coloration." The established rule is
that the intention to tax in a particular manner must be expressed in clear and unambiguous language, else it cannot be
enforced, and that words of exception are to receive a liberal
rather than a constricted construction, to the end that the
burdens imposed upon individuals may be confined rather
than extended. The rule together with its supporting authorities is stated in Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578, 583.

Mr. Solicitor General Hoyt for the United States:
The tax being an excise, the only limitation upon the
power of Congress to impose the tax is that it shall be
"uniform" throughout the United States. Const. art. 1,
§8, cl. 1. A tax is "uniform" when it operates with the
same force and effect in every place where the subject of it
is found. Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 594; Knowlton v.

The law does not violate those provisions of the Fifth
Amendment which declare that no person shall be deprived
of his liberty or property without due process of law; nor
shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation. The latter clause refers only to a direct appropriation of property for public purposes and not to a
so-called taking as the effect of taxation. Legal Tender
Cases, 12 Wall. 551; Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U. S.
642; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 668. Loan Association v.
Topeka, 20 Wall. 665, involved the taking of property by way
of taxes in aid of a private enterprise and is not to the contrary.
Due process of law is provided. The law subjects artificially colored oleomargarine to one rate of tax and uncolored oleomargarine to another rate; in case of a dispute
respecting the taxability of the article an appeal is provided
from the collector to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue;
and, in certain cases, a further appeal is allowed. This is
due process. Executive process may be due process. The

in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than those prescribed in the Constitution. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 431; Gibbons v.

to embarrass and destroy. Austin v. The Alderman, 7 Wall. 699.
Although the power to tax may be exercised oppressively,
or unwisely, the responsibility of the legislature is not to the
courts but to the people; for the judicial cannot prescribe to
the legislative department of the Government limitations
upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. Veazie Bank

By the Constitution, the Government is divided into three
distinct and independent branches, and it is the duty of
each to abstain from, and to oppose, encroachments on the
other. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dl. 410. The court cannot, therefore, interpose to declare an act of Congress, passed within the
general scope of its constitutional power, void, merely because
it may be, in the court's judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice. The ideas of natural justice are
regulated by no fixed standard and a court in declaring for
that reason only, a law invalid, would be merely substituting
its opinion for that of Congress. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 399;

Argument for the United States.

The provision of § 14 which authorizes the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to decide what substances or compounds are
subject to the tax, does not confer upon that officer judicial
power. He does not hear and decide a case as a judge does;
his action is but the ascertainment of a scientific fact by a
scientific process and the application of the law to the facts so
found. Such action is not judicial, but administrative in its
nature and constitutes due process. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat.

If the provision of § 14 of the original act, and amended
§ 8, be invalid, the entire law does not thereby fall, for the
act may be fully executed without those provisions. This is
not a penal law, but a revenue measure, and its provisions
are to be liberally construed. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 697.
If the valid portions of an act are separable and, standing
alone, will fully carry out its purposes, the court will not declare the whole act void but will give effect to its valid provisions. Packet Co. v. Keokuk, 95 U. S.89; Allen v. Louisiana, 103 U. S. 83; Railroad Co. v. Schutte, 103 U. S. 142;

In construing an act of Congress the court will not recur to

subject for information. In twenty-nine of the States the line
is drawn between uncolored oleomargarine and that colored in
imitation of butter, the manufacture and sale of the latter be-.
ing forbidden. The line is thus -drawn between the legitimate
article on the one hand and the fraudulent imitation on the
other. The States have thus created a classification and
Congress, in grading the tax, has merely recognized that
classification. This forms a proper basis for classification.
The court has recognized this distinction in a number of cases.
Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S. 461; Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, 171
U. S. 1; Collins v. New Hampshire, 171 U. S. 30; Capital City
Dairy-Co. v. Ohio, 183 U. S.238.
The classification may also be sustained as a means to prevent fraud in the collection of the tax laid upon the legitimate or uncolored oleomargarine. If oleomargarine can, by
means of coloration, successfully counterfeit butter, an untaxed
article, it may in that way evade the tax imposed upon it.
The degree of the tax is for Congress to determine.
It rests with Congress to say what means shall be adopted
to prevent fraud in the collection of its revenue. United
States v. 132 Packages of Liquors, 76 Fep. Rep. 364; Nicol v.
Ames, 173 U. S. 524; Felsenheld v. United States, 186 U. S.
131; United States v. Three Packages Distilled Spirits, 125 Fed.
Rep. 55; United States v. Singer, 15 Wall. 120.
The tax of ten cents per pound upon oleomargarine colored
in imitation of butter is not prohibitive of its manufacture and
sale. See vol. 9, Manufactures, p. 3, Census Report, 1900, for
summary of facts respecting the relative cost and .value of
butter and of oleomargarine. These facts show that the cost
and value of oleomargarine, with the ten cent tax added,
about equals the cost and value of butter.
In the testimony for the dealers it is stated that good butter costs on an average two cents per pound more than colored
oleomargarine in the Chicago market. In the face of this testimony it cannot be said with force that the falling off in

OCTOBER TERM,

195 U. S.

production is due to the rate of tax. The falling off is merely
indicative of the quantity of colored oleomargarine fraudulently sold as butter. If one effect of the law be to prevent
that fraud, the court for that reason will not declare the law
invalid:
If there be a legitimate demand for colored oleomargarine,
as such, the fact that it cannot be sold at butter prices will
not destroy the demand for it. If people prefer it to butter,
they will pay the increase in price, especially when the excess,
at most, is very trifling. This is true as to tobacco, liquors,
and imports subject to heavy duties.
The law does not deprive citizens of Illinois and Ohio of
any right guaranteed them by their States, for both States
absolutely prohibit the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine
artificially colored so as to resemble butter.
In the manufacture of oleomargarine, the use of butter
containing artificial coloration, subjects the product to the
ten cent tax; for it cannot be said to be "free from artificial
coloration" within the meaning of § 8, when in fact artificial
coloring matter has been introduced into the product at any
stage of its manufacture, by any means whatever.
As to coloration by means of palm oil: to subject a compound to the tax, it -is only necessary that it be composed of
some of the substances named in the act and "made in imitation or semblance of butter;" it need not be "calculated or
intended to be sold as butter or for butter."
Vegetable oils may properly be used in the manufacture of
oleomargarine when of such a character as to be naturally
adapted for use as food in the form in which used. Palm
oil is not such an oil. Unless chemically refined, in color it
is a dark orange, with a large per cent of acids, and with a
disagreeable taste and odor. Chemical refining, while taking
away most of the acids and odor, also takes away the color,
its only desirable property. Unless so refined, it can be used
only in very small quantities; for not only would a greater
use impart too high a color, but because of the acids, taste,

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and odor, would spoil the product. The oil used in this case
was not refined, else it would not have imparted the color.
Used in such minute quantity as in this case (less than one
per cent) the legal presumption is that it was used as a color,
and not as a fat. Such use constitutes an artificial coloration. See Lewkowitsch's Chemical Analysis of Oils, 2d ed.
p. 517; Allen's Chemical Organic Analysis, vol. 2, pt. 1, 3d ed.

after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JUSTIcE WHITE,

As the controversy in every aspect involves the acts of
Congress concerning the taxation of oleomargarine, a summary of those acts becomes essential.
. The original act was passed in 1886. 24 Stat. 209. The
first section provided:
"That for the purposes of this act the word 'butter'
shall be understood to mean the food product usually known
as butter, and which is made exclusively from milk or cream,
or both, with or without common salt, and with or without
additional coloring matter."
The second thus defined oleomargarine:
"That for the purposes of this act certain manufactured
substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine,'
namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine,
oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral;
all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds
of tallow, beef-fat, suet, lard, lard-oil, vegetable-oil and annotto, and other coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat
made in imitation or semblance of butter, or when so made,
calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter."
The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh sections imposed

Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

a license on manufacturers and dealers in oleomargarine, and
contained many requirements controlling the packing, marketing and supervision of the manufacture and sale of the
taxed article. The eighth section provided as follows:
"That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured
and sold, or removed for consumption or use, there sh all be
assessed and collected a tax of two cents per pound, to be
paid by the manufacturer thereof;

.

.

The tax levied

by this section shall be represented by coupon stamps and
the provisions of existing laws governing the engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement, and destruction of
stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable,
are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by this
section."
The other provisions of the statute, not necessary to be
noticed, contained many regulations looking to the enforcement and collection of the licenses and taxes which the act
imposed. In 1902 further provisions were made on the subject, and the act of 1886 was, inmany respects, expressly
amended. 32 Stat. 193. The title of the act is"An act to make oleomargarine and other imitation dairy
products subject to the laws of any State or Territory or
the District of Columbia into which they are transported,
and to change the tax on oleomargarine, and to impose a tax,
provide for the inspection and regulate the manufacture and
sale of certain dairy products, and to amend an act entitled 'An act defining butter, also imposing a tax upon and
regulating the manufacture, sale, importation and exportation of oleomargarine,' approved August second, eighteen hindred and eighty-six."
The first section provides that all"-oleomargarine, butterine, imitation, process, renovated,
or adulterated butter, or imitation cheese, or any substance in
the semblance of butter or cheese, not the usual product of
the dairy and not made exclusively of pure and unadulterated milk or cream, transported into any State or Territory

Opinion of the Court.

or the District of Columbia,. and remaining therein for use,
consumption, sale or storage therein, shall, upon the arrival
within the limits of such State or Territory or the District
of Columbia, be subject to the operation and effect of the
laws of such State or Territory or the District of Columbia

.

.

to the same extent and in the same manner as

though such article or substances had been produced in such
State or Territory or -the District of Columbia, and shall not
be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein
in original packages or otherwise."
Section 2 anends section 3 of the act of 1886 in particulars not necessary for the purposes of this case to be considered. Section 3 amends section 8 of the act of 1886 by
increasing the tax on oleomargarine from two (2) to ten (10)
cents per pound, with this proviso:
"Provided, When oleomargarine is free from artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be one-fourth of one cent per pound. The
tax levied by this section shall be represented by coupon
stamps; and the provisions of existing laws governing the
engraving, issue, sale, accountability, effacement and destruction of stamps relating to tobacco and snuff, as far as applicable, are hereby made to apply to stamps provided for by
this section."
Section 4 reiterates the definition of butter contained in
the first section of the act of 1886, and besides gives a definition of " adulterated butter," "process butter" or "renovated butter," and imposes taxes upon the manufacture and
sale of these articles, the tax upon adulterated butter being
at the rate of ten cents a pound.
The section in question as well as those following it contain many administrative provisions for the enforcement of
the taxes levied by the act and concerning interstate and foreign commerce in the articles referred to. Bearing, then, the
statutes in mind, we come to consider the assignments of error, which are as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
'Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

"The District Court erred in sustaining the demurrer of
the United States to the answer of plaintiff in error (defendant below).
"The District Court erred in refusing to hold that the act
of Congress approved August 2, 1886, as amended by the
act of Congress approved May 9, 1902, is in contravention
of the Constitution of the United States of America and of
the amendments thereto, and is illegal and void, for the reasons:
"(a) The act deprives the defendant of his property without due process of law.
"(b) The act is an unwarranted encroachment, upon and an
interference with the police powers reserved- to the several
States and to the people of the United States.
"(c) The actso arbitrarily discriminates againstoleomargarine
in favor of butter as to destroy the oleomargarine industry for
the benefit of the butter industry in the United States, and is
thus repugnant to those fundamental principles which are inherent in the Constitution of the United States.
"The District Court erred in holding, if said act be not in
contravention of the Constitution of the United States, that
oleomargarine, which contains no artificial coloration than that
imparted to it by the use of butter which itself contains coloring
matter and which therefore causes said oleomargarine to look
like butter of a shade of yellow, is subject to a tax of ten
cents per pound instead of a tax of one-fourth of one cent
per pound."
It is to be observed that in the errors thus assigned no reference is made to the contention in the answer that the acts of
Congress were void because conferring upon administrative
officers the power to finally decide what constituted artificial
coloration, such contention therefore may be put out of view.
The errors relied upon embrace not only the contention that
the act of Congress imposing the tax is repugnant to the Constitution, but also that the penalty was wrongfully enforced,
because the one-quarter of a cent per pound which had been

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

paid on the oleomargarine was the only tax to which it was
liable under the act of Congress when rightly construed. As
the presence of the constitutional question imposes upon us
the duty of considering also the construction of the statute,
we shall invert the order in which the errors have been assigned,
and come to consider, first, whether the act of Congress, as
properly construed, required on the oleomargarine in question
a tax of ten cents a pound; and, second, -if it did, whether
such act is repugnant to the Constitution of the United
States.
1st. The construction of the statute.
Leaving out of view the proviso to the eighth section of the
act of 1886 as amended and reenacted by the third section
of the act of 1902, it is beyond question that a tax of ten cents
a pound is imposed upon oleomargarine. As the product
was admitted by the answer to be oleomargarine, it follows
that it was subject to the tax of ten cents a pound, unless,
by the proviso the oleomargarine was of such a character as
to entitle it to the benefits of a lower rate of taxation. Now
the proviso reads :, "Provided, When oleomargarine is free from
artificial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any
shade of yellow, such tax shall be one-fourth of one cent per
pound." As it was admitted that the oleomargarine was of a
shade of yellow causing it to look like butter, and as it was
also admitted that this shade of yellow had been imparted by
an artificial coloring matter used to color the butter which
formed one of the ingredients from which the oleomargarine
was manufactured, it results, if the text of the statute be applied, that the oleomargarine was not within the proviso, because it was not free from artificial coloring matter causing
'it to look like butter. This necessarily follows, since the right
to enjoy the lower rate of tax is made by the proviso to depend upon whether, as a matter of fact, the oleomargarine was
free from artificial coloring matter, and not upon the mere
method adopted for imparting the artificial color. As the oleomargarine in question was in fact not free from artificial col-

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

oration we think that a construction which would take it out
of the general rule imposing the ten cent tax upon all oleomargarine, and bring it within the exception embracing only
oleomargarine free from artificial coloration, would be not an
interpretation of the statute, but a disregard of its unambiguous provisions.
But it is contended that, as section 2 of the act of 1886
defined oleomargarine, for the purposes of that act, to be "certain manufactured substances, certain extracts and certain
mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter," and as not only the act of 1886, but the
act of 1902, defined butter, for the purposes of those acts, to
mean "the food product usually known as butter, and which
is made exclusively from milk or cream, or both, with or without common salt, and with or without additional coloring
matter," therefore colored oleomargarine produced by using,
as one of the ingredients of its manufacture, butter artificially
colored must be treated as free from artificial coloration within
the meaning of the act of 1902, and the deduction made is
that, as the statute treats butter, both with or without artificial coloration, as a legitimate ingredient of oleomargarine, the
use of an authorized ingredient did not cause the manufactured product to be other than oleomargarine within the statute.
But the proposition goes further, and asserts that because
butter, whether artificially colored or not, was an authorized
ingredient of oleomargarine, therefore the finished product,
in which either of these ingredients was used, was not only oleomargarine, but necessarily also was oleomargarine free from
artificial coloration. This is an obvious non sequitur. As the
benefit of the lower tax depended upon the absence from the
manufactured product of artificial coloration, it follows that
if in the manufacture an authorized ingredient, which was artificially colored, was used so as to artificially color the product
whilst that product would be oleomargarine, it could not be oleomargarine free from artificial coloration within the intendment
of the proviso, Nor is there force in the contention that the

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

plain meaning of the statute is overcome by an amendment
to which it was subjected. Before the amendment relied
on, the proviso read as follows: "Provided, when oleomargarine
is free from coloration or ingredient that causes it to look like
butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall be one-fourth
of one cent per pound." By the amendment the word ingredient was stricken out, thus leaving the proviso in the form
in which it was enacted. The proposition is that the elimination of the word " ingredient" compels to the conclusion
that wherever artificial coloration in the finished product of
oleomargarine was produced by artificial coloration used in
an authorized ingredient, that such coloration was not artificial within the statute. But this disregards the fact that
butter, both when artificially colored and when not so colored, was made an authorized ingredient of oleomargarine.
If then the word " ingredient" had not been stricken out,
it might have given rise to the contention that the imparting of a yellow color to the finished product of oleomargarine by the use in its manufacture of spring butter of a
natural yellow color would have caused the product oleomargarine to be artificially colored within the statute. As the
manufacturer of oleomargarine was permitted to use either
butter not artificially colored or butter so colored, the effect
of striking out the word " ingredient" operated simply to
render it certain that the finished product, even although of
a yellow color, would be within the proviso where the color
was imparted by an authorized ingredient not artificially colored. This overthrows the contention that fhe finished product, when not free from artificial coloration, must be treated
as free from such coloration, because the color was derived
from an artificially colored though authorized ingredient. We
think, whilst the statute recognized the right of a manufacturer to use any or all of the authorized ingredients so -as to
make oleomargarine, and also authorized as one of the ingredients butter artificially colored, if the manufacturer elected
to use such ingredient last mentioned, and thereby gave to
VOL. cXCV-

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

his manufactured product artificial coloration, such product
so colored, although being oleomargarine, was not within the
exception created by the proviso, and therefore came under
.the general rule subjecting oleomargarine to the tax of ten
cents a pound.
Nor do the other provisions of the act of 1902, as it is
asserted, sustain the contention that artificially colored oleomargarine is to be treated as free from such coloration, because such color was imparted in its manufacture by the use
of an artificially colored and authorized- ingredient. The provision principally depended upon is section 2 of the act of
1902, which provides that any person who "sells, vends or
furnishes oleomargarine for the use and consumption of
others, except to his own family table, without. compensation, who shall add to or mix with such oleomargarine any
artificial coloration, .
.
shall also be held to be a manufacturer of oleomargarine . . ." But this section relates only to the adding to or mixing artificial coloration
with oleomargarine after its manufacture, and therefore does
not even remotely support the proposition that, where in the
process of manufacture oleomargarine becomes artificially colored, it must be held not to be what it in fact is, that is,
must be treated as free from artificial coloration, although
such in fact is not the case.
Indeed, the context of the statutes, particularly the provisions as to adulterated and renovated butter in the act of
1902, harmonize with and thus add cogency to the construction which we have given to the provision concerning artificial coloration.
2d. Did Congress in passing the acts which are assailed, exert a power not conferred by the Constitution?
That the acts in question on their face impose excise taxes
which Congress had the power to levy is so completely established as to require only statement. Patton v. Brady, 184
U. S. 608, 619 ; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41; Nico! v.
Ames, 173 U. S. 509; In re Kollocc, 165 U. S. 526.

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

The last case referred to (In re Kollock) involved the act
of 1886, and the court, speaking through Mlr. Chief Justice
Fuller, said (p. 536):
"The. act before us is on its face an act for levying taxes,
and although it may operate in so doing to prevent deception in the sale of oleomargarine as and for butter, its primary object must be assumed to be the raising of revenue."We might rest the answer to the contention as to the want
of power in Congress to enact the laws in question upon the
foregoing cases. But in view of the earnestness with which
the validity of the acts is assailed in argument and the assertion that the necessary effect of the amendment to the
act of 1886 by the act of 1902 is to make both of the laws
in question. so peculiar as to cause them to be beyond the
reach of the previous rulings of this court, we propose to
review and dispose of the propositions pressed upon us at
bar as indubitably demonstrating that the acts in question
were beyond the power of Congress to adopt.
The summary which follows embodies the propositions contained in the assignments of error, and the substance of the
elaborate argument by which those assignments are deemed
to be sustained. Not denying the general power of Congress
to impose excise taxes, and conceding that the acts in question, on their face, purport to levy taxes of that character,
the propositions are these:
(a) That the power of internal taxation which the Constitution confers on Congress is given to that body for the purpose of raising revenue, and that the tax on artificially
colored oleomargarine is void because it is of such an onerous character as to make it manifest that the purpose of
Congress'in levying it was not to raise revenue but to suppress the manufacture of the taxed article.
(b) The power to regulate the manufacture and sale of
oleomargarine being solely reserved to the several States, it
follows that the acts in question, enacted by Congress for
the purpose of suppressing the manufacture and sale of oleo-

195 U. S.

margarine, when artificially colored, are void, because usurping the reserved power of the States, and therefore exerting
an authority not delegated to Congress by the Constitution.
(c) Whilst it is true-so the argument proceeds-that
Congress in exerting the taxing power conferred upon it may
use all means appropriate to the exercise of such power, a
tax which is fixed at such a high rate as to suppress the
production of the article taxed, is not a legitimate means to
the lawful end, and is therefore beyond the scope of the taxing power.
(d) As the tax levied by the acts which are assailed discriminates against oleomargarine artificially colored, and in
favor of butter so colored, and creates an unwarranted and
unreasonable distinction between the oleomargarine which is
artificially colored and that which is not, and as the necessary
operation and effect of the tax is to suppress the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine, and to aid the butter industry, therefore the acts are void. And with this proposition in mind it is insisted that wherever the judiciary is
called upon to determine whether a power which Congress
has exerted is within the authority conferred by the Constitution, the duty is to test the validity of the act, not merely
by its face, or to use the words of the argument, "by the
label placed upon it by Congress," but by the necessary
scope and effect of the assailed enactment.
(e) Admitting that the power to tax as delegated to Congress by the Constitution as originally adopted was subject to
no limitation except as expressed in that instrument, the
amendments to the Constitution, it is urged, have imposed
limitations on the taxing power not expressed in the original
Constitution. Under this assumption it is insisted that the
acts in question are void, because the burdens which they
impose are repugnant to both the Fifth and Tenth Amendments. To the Fifth Amendment, because the amount of the
tax is so out of proportion to the value of the property taxed
as to destroy that property, and thus amount to a taking

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

thereof without due process of law. To the Tenth Amendment, because the necessary operation and effect of the acts
is to destroy the oleomargarine industry and thus exert a
power not delegated to Congress, but reserved to the several
States.
(7) Although, as a general rule, it be true that the power
of Congress to tax, conferred by the Constitution, is unlimited,
except as otherwise expressed in that instrument, and conceding, for the sake of the argument, that there is no express limitation either in the original Constitution or in the
amendments thereto, by which the acts may be decided to
be unconstitutional, nevertheless, it is urged, that, as the
burdens which the acts impose are so onerous and so unjust
as to be confiscatory, the acts are void, because they amount
to a violation of those fundamental rights which it is the duty
of every free government to protect.
It is clear that these propositions in many respects not only
reiterate in different forms of expression the same contention,
but that they also so intermingle considerations which require
separate analysis so as to cause it to be difficult to precisely
determine their import. For instance, all of the propositions
obviously rest not only on inferences drawn from the face of
the acts, but also on deductions made from what it is assumed must have been the motives or purposes of Congress
in passing them. To avoid confusion and repetition we shall
consider these distinct contentions separately, and we hence
come, first, to ascertain how far, if at all, the motives or purposes of Congress are open to judicial inquiry in considering
the power of that body to enact the laws in question. Having determined the question of our right to consider motive
or purpose we shall then approach the propositions relied on
by the light of the correct rule on the subject of purpose or
motive.
Whilst, as a result of our written constitution, it is axiomatic that the judicial department of the government is
charged with the solemn duty of enforcing the Constitution,

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

195 U. S.

and therefore in cases properly presented, of determining
whether a given manifestation of authority has exceeded the
power conferred by that instrument, no instance is afforded
from the foundation of the government where an act, which
was within a power conferred, was declared to be repugnant
to the Constitution, because it appeared to the judicial mind
that the particular exertion of constitutional power was
either unwise or unjust. To announce such a principle would
amount to declaring that in our constitutional system the
judiciary was not only charged with the duty of upholding
the Constitution but also with the responsibility of correcting every possible abuse arising from the exercise by the
other departments of their conceded authority. So to hold
would be to overthrow the entire distinction between the
legislative, judicial and executive departments of the government, upon which our system is founded, and would be a mere
act of judicial usurpation.
It is, however, argued if a lawful power may be exerted
for an unlawful purpose, and thus by abusing the power it
may be made to accomplish a result not intended by the Constitution, all limitations of power must disappear, and the
grave function lodged in the judiciary, to confine all the departments within the authority conferred by the Constitution,
will be of no avail. This, when reduced to its last analysis,
comes to this, that, because a particular department of the
government may exert its lawful powers with the object or
motive of reaching an end not justified, therefore it becomes
the duty of the judiciary to restrain the exercise of a lawful
power where-ver it seems to the judicial mind that such lawful power has been abused. But this reduces itself to the
contention that, under our constitutional system, the abuse
by one department of the government of its lawful powers is
to be corrected by the abuse of its powers by another department.
The proposition, if sustained, would destroy all distinction
between the powers of the respective departments of the gov-

AMcCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ernment, would put an end to that confidence and respect
for each other which it was the purpose of the Constitution to
uphold, and would thus be full of danger to the permanence
of our institutions. As aptly said by the court, speaking
through Mr. Justice Miller, in Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S.
168, p. 190 :
"It is believed to be one of the chief merits of the American system of written constitutional law, that all the powers
intrusted to the government, whether State or National, are divided into the three grand departments, the executive, the
legislative, and the judicial. That the functions appropriate
to each of these branches of government shall be vested in a
separate body of public servants, and that the perfection of
the system requires that the lines which separate and divide
these departments shall be broadly and clearly defined. It is
also essential to the successful working of this system that the
persons intrusted with power in any one of these branches
shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided
to others, but that each shall by the law of its creation be liraited to the exercise of the powers appropriate to its own department and no other."
It is, of course, true, as suggested, that if there be no authority in the judiciary to restrain a lawful exercise of power
by another department of the government, where a wrong
vaotive or purpose has impelled to the exertion of the power,
that abuses of a power conferred may be temporarily effectual.
The remedy for this, however, lies, not in the abuse by the
judicial authority of its functions, but in the people, upon
whom, after all, under our institutions, reliance must be placed
for the correction of abuses committed in the exercise of a
lawful power. This was aptly pointed out in Champion
v. Ames, 188 U. S.321, where, speaking through Mr. Justice
Harlan, it was said (p. 363) :
" But if what Congress does is within the limits of its
power, and is simply unwise- or injurious, the remedy is that
suggested by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, when

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

he said :'The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their
identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other
instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its
abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must
often rely solely, in all representative governments.'"
The decisions of this court from the beginning lend no support whatever to the assumption that the judiciary may restrain the exercise of lawful power on the assumption that a
wrongful purpose or motive has caused the power to be exerted. As we have previously said, from the beginning no
case can be found announcing such a doctrine, and on the
contrary the doctrine of a number of cases is inconsistent with
its existence. As quite recently pointed out by this court in
Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 60, the often quoted statement of Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland,that
the power to tax is the power to destroy, affords no support
whatever to the proposition that where there is a lawful power
to impose a tax its imposition may be treated as without
the power because of the destructive effect of the exertion of
the authority. And this view wa's clearly pointed out by Mr.
Chief Justice Marshall in the passage from Gibbons v. Ogden,
9 Wheat. 1, which was repeated in the passage from the opinion in Champion v. Ames, previously cited.
And the same doctrine has been again and again expounded.
In the License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, referring to the extensive power of taxation possessed by Congress, and the express
limitations found in the Constitution, it was said (p. 471):
"It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very extensive power. It is given in the Constitution, with only one
exception and only two qualifications. Congress cannot tax
exports, and it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule of uniformity.
Thus limited, and thus only, it reaches every subject, and
may be exercised at discretion."

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, referring to
the unlimited nature of the power of taxation conferred upon
Congress, it was observed (p. 443):
"Congress may prescribe the basis, fix the rates, and require payment as it may deem proper. Within the limits of
the Constitution it is supreme in its action. No power of
supervision or control is lodged in either of the other departments of the government."
And after referring to the express limitations .as to uniformity and articles exported from any State, it was remarked
(p. 446):
" With these exceptions, the exercise of the power is, in
all respects, unfettered."
In Austin v. The Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, it was again'declared (p. 699) that " the right of taxation, where it exists,
is necessarily unlimited in its nature. It carries with it inherently the power to embarrass and destroy."
Yet again, in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, where a
tax levied by Congress on the circulating notes of state banks
was assailed on the ground that the tax was intended to destroy the circulation of such notes, and was, besides, the exercise of a power, to tax a subject not conferred upon Congress, it was said, as to the first contention (p. 548):
"It is insisted, however, that the tax in the case before us
is excessive, and so excessive as to indicate a purpose on the
part of Congress to destroy the franchise of the bank, and is,
therefore, beyond the constitutional power of Congress.
"The first answer to this is that the judicial cannot prescribe
to the legislative departments of the government limitations
upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The power to
tax m ay be exercised oppressively upon persons, but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to the
people by whom its members are elected. So if a particular
tax bears heavily upon a corporation, or a class of corporations, it cannot, for that reason only, be pronounced contrary
to the Constitution."

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

True it is, as argued, that the opinion in that case rested
the conclusion not alone upon the doctrine just quoted, but
also upon the principle that Congress possessed the power to
suppress the circulation of the notes of state banks as an incident to the authority concerning the currency delegated to
Congress by the Constitution. But whilst this argument may
weaken the authoritative force of the statement made in the
case in question as to the want of power in the judiciary to
examine into motive, it does not affect the persuasive and inherent force of the reasoning by which thatview was sustained.
Besides, the doctrine has since been affirmed.
In Spencer v. Merchant, 125 U. S. 345, 355, speaking through
Mr. Justice Gray, it was said:
"In the words of Chief Justice Chase, condensing what had
been said long before by Chief Justice Marshall, 'The judicial
department cannot prescribe to the legislative department
limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers.
The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons;
but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts,
but to the people by whom its members are elected.'"
In Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, the cases which have
been referred to, were approvingly cited, and the doctrine
which they expressed was restated.
In Treat v. White, 181 U. S. 264, referring to a stamp duty
levied by Congress, it was observed (p. 269):
"The power of Congress in this direction is unlimited. It
does not come within the province of this court to consider
why agreements to sell shall be subject to the stamp duty
and agreements to buy not. It is enough that Congress in
this legislation has imposed a stamp duty upon the one and
not upon the other."
In Pattonv. Brady, 184 U. S. 608, considering another stamp
duty levied by Congress, it was again said (p. 623):
"That it is no part of the function of a court to inquire
into the reasonableness of the excise, either as respects the
amount, or the property upon which it is imposed."

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
-195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It being thus demonstrated that the motive or purpose of
Congress in adopting the acts in question may not be inquired
into, we are brought to consider the contentions relied upon
to show that the acts assailed were beyond the power of Congress, putting entirely out of view all considerations based
upon purpose or motive.
1. Undoubtedly, in determining whether a particular act is
within a granted power, its scope and effect are to be considered. Applying this rule to the acts assailed, it is self-evident that on their face they levy an excise tax. That being
their necessary scope and operation, it follows that the acts
are within the grant of power. * The argument to the contrary
rests on the proposition that, although the tax be within the
power, as enforcing it will destroy or restrict the manufacture
of artificially colored oleomargarine, therefore the power to
levy the tax did not obtain. This, however, is but to say
that the question of power depends, not upon the authority
conferred by the Constitution, but upon what may be the
consequence arising from the exercise of the lawful authority.
Since, as pointed out in all the decisions referred to, the
taxing power conferred by the Constitution knows no limits
except those expressly stated in that instrument, it must follow, if a tax be within the lawful power, the exertion of that
power may not be judicially restrained because of the results
to arise from its exercise. The proposition now relied upon was
urged in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, and was overruled.
In that case it was insisted that, although death duties were
within the power to levy excise taxation, as the effect of their
extreme enforcement would involve the power to destroy the
right to the passage or receipt of property on the occasion of
death-a subject within the exclusive control of the Statestherefore death duties when imposed by Congress must be
held to be unconstitutional. In considering this contention,
after referring to the statement of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall,
in McCulloch v. Maryland, that the power to tax- involves
•the power to destroy, it was observed (p. 60):

OCTOBER TERM
t f, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

"This principle is pertinent only when there is no power to
tax a particular subject, and has no relation to a case where
such right exists. In other words, the power to destroy which
may be the consequence of taxation is a reason why the right
to tax should be confined to subjects which may be lawfully
embraced therein, even although it happens that in some particular instance no great harm may be caused by the exercise
of the taxing authority as to a subject which is beyond its
scope. But this reasoning has no application to a lawful
tax, for if it had there would be an end of all taxation; that
is to say, if a lawful tax can be defeated because the power
which is manifested by its imposition may when further exercised be destructive, it would follow that every lawful tax
would become unlawful, and therefore no taxation whatever
could be levied."
Of course, where a state law is assailed as repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States, and on its face such act
was seemingly within the power of the State to adopt, but
its necessary effect and operation is to usurp a power granted
by the Constitution to the Government of the United States,
it must follow, from the paramount nature of the Constitution
of the United States, that the act is void. In such a case the
result of the test of necessary operation and effect is to demonstrate the want of power, because of the controlling nature of
the limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United
States on the States.
And without attempting to review the numerous authorities
cited in the argument, it suffices to say that we think it is apparent that they fall within one or the other of the categories
just previously stated.
2. The proposition that where a tax is imposed which is
within the grant of powers, and which does not conflict with
any express constitutional limitation, the courts may hold the
tax to be void because it is deemed that the tax is too high,
is absolutely disposed of by the opinions in the cases hitherto
cited, and which expressly hold, to repeat again the language

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of one of the cases, (Spencer v. Merchant,) that "The judicial
department cannot prescribe to the legislative department limitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers. The
power to tax maybe exercised oppressively upon persons; but
the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to
the people by whom its members are elected."
3. Whilst undoubtedly both the Fifth and Tenth Amendments qualify, in so far as they are applicable, all the provisions of the Constitution, nothing in those amendments operates
to take away the grant of power to tax conferred by the Constitution uqpon Congress. The contention on this subject rests
upon the theory that the purpose and motive of Congress in
exercising its undoubted powers may be inquired into by the
courts, and the proposition is therefore disposed of by what
has been said on that subject.
The right of Congress to tax within its delegated power being unrestrained, except hs limited by the Constitution, .it
was within the authority conferred on Congress to select the
objects upon which an excise should be laid. It therefore follows that, in exerting its power, no want of due process of law
could possibly result, because that body chose to impose an
excise on artificially colored oleomargarine and not upon natural butter artificially colored.. The judicial power may not
usurp the functions of the legislative in order to control .that
branch of the government in the performance of its lawful
duties. This was aptly pointed put in the extract heretofore
made- from the 'opinion in Treat v. White, 181 U. S. 264.
But it is urged that artificially colored oleomargarine and
artificially colored natural butter are in substance and in effect
one and the same thing, and from this it is deduced that to lay
an excise tax only on oleomargarine artificially colored and not
on butter so colored is violative of the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment, because, as there is no possible distinction
between the two, the act of Congress was a mere arbitrary. imposition of an excise on the one article and not on the other,
although essentially of the same class. Conceding merely for

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

the sake of argument that the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment, would avoid an exertion of the taxing power
which, without any basis for classification, arbitrarily taxed
one article and excluded an article of the same class, such concession would be wholly inapposite to the case in hand. The
distinction between natural butter artificially colored, and oleomargarine artificially colored so as to cause it to look like butter, has been pointed out in previous adjudications of this court.
Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, 183 U. S. 238, and authorities
there cited. Indeed, in the cases referred to the distinction between the two products was held to be so marked, and the
aptitude of oleomargarine when artificially colored, to deceive
the public into believing it to be butter, was decided to be
so great that it was held no violation of the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was occasioned by state
legislation absolutely forbidding the manufacture, within the
State, of oleomargarine artifically colored. As it has been
thus decided that the distinction between the two products
is so great as to justify the absolute prohibition of the manufacture of oleomargarine artificially colored, there is no foundation for the proposition that the difference between the two
was not sufficient, under the extremest view, to justify a classification, distinguishing between them.
4. Lastly we come to consider the argument that, even
though as a general rule a tax of the nature of the one in
question would be within the power of Congress, in this case
the tax should be held not to be within such power, because
of its effect. This is based on the contention that, as the
tax is so large as to destroy the business of manufacturing
oleomargarine artificially colored, to look like butter, it thus
deprives the manufacturers of that article of their freedom to
engage in a lawful pursuit, and hence, irrespective of the distribution of powers made by the Constitution, the taxing
laws are void, because they violate those fundamental rights
which it is the duty of every free government to safeguard,
and which, therefore, should be held to be embraced by ia-

McCRAY v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

plied though none the less -potential guaranties, or in any
event to be within the protection of the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment.
Let us concede, for the sake of argument only, the premise
of fact upon which the proposition is based. Moreover, concede for the sake of argument only, that even although a particular exertion of power by Congress was not restrained by
any express limitation of the Constitution, if by the perverted
exercise of such power so great an abuse was manifested as to
destroy fundamental rights which no free government could
consistently violate, that it would be the duty of the judiciary
to hold such acts to be void upon the assumption that the
Constitution by necessary implication forbade them.
Such concession, however, is not controlling in this case.
This follows when the nature of oleomargarine, artificially colored to look like butter, is recalled. As we have said, it has
been conclusively settled by this court that the tendency of
that article to deceive the public into buying it for butter is
such that the States may, in the exertion of their police powers,
without violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, absolutely prohibit the manufacture of the article.\ It hence results, that even although it be true that the
effect of the tax in question is to repress the manufacture of
artificially colored oleomargarine, it cannot be said that such
repression destroys rights which no free government could destroy, and, therefore, no ground exists to sustain the proposi-tion that the judiciary may invoke an implied prohibition,
upon the theory that to do so is essential to save such rights
from destruction. And the same considerations dispose of
the contention based upon the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment. That provision, as we have previously said,
does not withdraw or expressly limit the grant of power to
tax conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. From this
it follows, as we have also previously declared, that the judiciary is without authority to avoid an act of Congress exerting the taxing power, even in a case where to the judicial mind

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

it seems that Congress had in putting such power in motion
abused its lawful authority by levying a tax which was unwise
or oppressive, or the result of the enforcement of which might
be to indirectly affect subjects not within the powers delegated
to Congress.
Let us concede that if a case was presented where the abuse
of the taxing power was so extreme as to be beyond the principles which we have previously stated, and where it was plain
to the judicial mind that the power had been called into play
not for revenue but solely for the purpose of destroying rights
which could not be rightfully destroyed consistently with the
principles of freedom and justice upon which the Constitution
rests, that it would be the duty of the courts to say that such
an arbitrary act was not merely an abuse of a delegated power,
but was the exercise of an authority not conferred. This concession, however, like the one previously made, must be without influence upon the decision of this cause for the reasons
previously stated; that is, that the manufacture of artificially
colored oleomargarine may be prohibited by a free government
without a violation of fundamental rights.
