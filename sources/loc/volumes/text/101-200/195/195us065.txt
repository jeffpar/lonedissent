A written waiver of a jury by a defendant in an action brought by the
United States to recover a penalty of fifty dollars under ยง 11 of the act
of 1886 as amended by the act of May 9, 1902, is not in conflict with the

Mr. Solicitor General Hoyt for the United States:
The proceedings are byway of criminal information to impose
the penalty provided for violation of section 11, of the oleomargarine act. They are directed against the persons and do
not seek to forfeit their property. They are, therefore, not
penal actions but criminal prosecutions.
"Civil proceedings " would seem to include only those in
which the object sought is the forfeiture of property, or the
recovery of a judgment for the amount of the prescribed
penalty. 16 Ency. P1. & Pr. p. 231; Atcheson v. Everett, 1

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
-Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

The knowingly purchasing or receiving for sale of oleomargarine not stamped according to law is specifically denominated an "offense," the penalty for which is $50. This
being a petty offense, why may not a defendant waive his
right to a trial by jury ? Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 552;
Brewater v. People, 183 Illinois, 143. Upon this point the
decisions are not uniform. United States v. Shaw, 59 Fed. Rep.
110, distinctly asserts such a right. Also Bank of Columbia
v. Okely, 4 Wheat. 244. As bearing upon the subject, see
UnitedStates v. Anthony, 11 Blatch. 200; United States v. Taylor, 11 Fed. Rep. 470; In re Belt, 159 U. S. 95; Hallingerv.
Davis, 146 U. S. 318; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 353.
While the language of Art. 3 of the Constitution is that
the trial of all crimes shall be by jury, the language of the
Sixth Amendment is that the accused shall enjoy the right
to a trial by jury; and similar language is used in the
Seventh Amendment. If a trial by jury be imperative,
then it cannot be waived, even though a statute authorizes
such a waiver; for a statute cannot nullify a constitutional
requirement. But it is the right to such a trial that is preserved by these Amendments. And if it be only the right,
why may not the accused waive that right, even in the absence of a statute authorizing him to do so, especially in a
petty case, where jury trial was not provided for under the
common law?
Express written waiver of such right was filed in each of
these cases. If that right did not exist, is not a trial by
the court, after such an attempted waiver, at most only
error? And, not having been assigned as error below, or in
this court, how can it be noticed here? Maxwell v. Stewart,

ing been settled in McCray v. United States, just decided,
there is in these two cases only a single question. The plaintiffs in error were severally prosecuted by information in the
District Court of the United States for the Northern District
of Illinois, under section 11 of the act of August 2, 1886, 24
Stat. 209, which reads: "That every person who knowingly
purchases or receives for sale any oleomargarine which has
not been branded or stamped according to law shall be liable
to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such offense."
In each case the parties in writing waived a jury and agreed
to submit the issues to the court. Judgments were entered
in favor of the United States and their collection ordered by
only the civil process of execution. That the defendants had
failed to comply with the section was proved. Indeed, it
was not seriously disputed, the defence resting only on the
alleged unconstitutionality of the act. The waiver of a jury
was not assigned as error, nor referred to by counsel at the
hearing before us, either in brief or argument. The question
of its effect upon the judgment was suggested by this court,
and briefs were called for from the respective parties. Such
briefs have been filed, and both agree that the waiver of a
jury did not invalidate the proceedings. Notwithstanding
this, the fact of the waiver appears in the record.
We entertain no doubt that the parties could rightfully
make such a waiver, and that the judgments are in no way
invalidated thereby. It will be noticed that the section characterizes the act prohibited as an offense, and subjects the
party to a penalty of fifty dollars. So small a penalty for
violating a revenue statute indicates only a petty offense. It
is not one necessarily involving any moral delinquency. The
violation may have been the result of ignorance or thoughtlessness, and must be classed with such illegal acts as acting
as an auctioneer or peddler withotit a license, or making a
deed without affixing the proper stamp. That by other sections of this statute more serious offenses are described and
more grave punishments provided does not lift this one to the

OCTOBER TERME, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

dignity of a crime. Not infrequently a single statute in its
several sections provides for offenses of different grades, subject to different punishments, and to prosecution in different
ways. In some States in the same act are gathered all the
various offenses against the person, ranging from simple assault to murder, and imposing punishments from a mere fine
to death. This very statute furnishes an illustration. By
one clause the knowingly selling of adulterated butter in any
other than the prescribed form subjects the party convicted
thereof to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars and
imprisonment for not more than two years. An officer of
customs violating certain provisions of the act is declared
guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not less than
one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, and
imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than
three years. Obviously these violations of certain provisions
of the statute must be classed among serious criminal offenses,
and can be prosecuted only by indictment, while the violations of the statute in the cases before us were prosecuted by
information. The truth is, the nature of the offense and
the amount of punishment prescribed rather than its place in
the statutes determine whether it is to be classed among serious or petty offenses, whether among crimes or misdemeanors.
Clearly both indicate that this particular violation of the statute is only a petty offense.
In such a case there is no constitutional requirement of a
jury. In the third clause of section 2, Article III, of the Constitution it is provided that "the trial of all crimes, except in
cases of impeachment, shall be by jury;" and in Article VI
of the amendments, that "in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an
impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime
shall have been committed." If there be any conflict between these two provisions the one found in the amendments
must control, under the well-understood rule that the last expression of the will of the lawmaker prevails over an earlier

one. But that in the body of the Constitution does not include a petty offense like the present. It must be. read in
the light of the common law. "That," said Mr. Justice
Bradley, in Moore v. United States, 91 U. S. 270, 274, referring to the common law, "is the system from which our judicial ideas and legal definitions are derived. The language
of the Constitution and of many acts of Congress could not
be .understood without reference to the common law." Again
in Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, 478, is this declaration
by Mr. Justice Matthews: "The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the
fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the
English common law, and are to be read in the light of its
history." In United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S.649,
654, Mr. Justice Gray used this language:
"In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the
light of the common law, the principles and history of which
were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution.
Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162; Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.
S.417, 422; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S.616, 624, 625;
Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465." See also Kepner v.
United States, post, 100; 1 Kent, Com. 336.
Blackstone's Commentaries are accepted as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England. At the
time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution it had been
published about twenty years, and it has been said that more
copies of the work had been sold in this country than in England, so that undoubtedly the framers of the Constitution
were familiar with it. In this treatise, vol. 4, p. 5,is given a
definition of the word "crimes:"
"A crime, or misdemeanor, is an act committed, or omitted,
in violation of a public law either forbidding or commanding
it. This general definition comprehends both crimes and misdemeanors; which, properly speaking, are mere synonymous
terms; though in common usage the word ' crimes' is made
to denote such offenses as are of a deeper and more atrocious

dye; while smaller faults and omissions of less consequence
are comprised under the gentler name of 'midemeanors'
only."
In the light of this definition we can appreciate the action
of the convention which framed the Constitution. In the
draft of that instrument, as reported by the committee of
five, the language was " the trial of all criminal offenses
. . . shall be by jury," but by unanimous vote it was
amended so as to read " the trial of all crimes." The significance of this change cannot be misunderstood. If the language had remained " criminal offenses," it might have been
contended that it meant all offenses of a criminal nature,
petty as well as serious, but when the change was made from
" criminal offenses " to "crimes,'" and made in the light of
the popular understanding of the meaning of the word
" crimes," as stated by Blackstone, it is obvious that the intent was to exclude from the constitutional requirement
of a jury the trial of petty criminal offenses. But we need
not go beyond the express rulings of this court. In
Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, reference was made to many
decisions of state courts, holding that the trial of petty offenses was not within any constitutional provision requiring
a jury in the trial of crimes, and on page 557 it was said:
" Except in that class or grade of offenses called petty offenses, which, according to the common law, may be proceeded
against summarily in any tribunal legally constituted for thatpurpose, the guarantee of an impartial jury to the accused in
a criminal prosecution, conducted either in the name, or by or
under the authority of, the United States, secures to him the
right to enjoy that mode of trial from the first moment, and
in whatever court, he is put on trial for the offense charged."
By section 563, Rev. Stat., the District Courts are given
jurisdiction "of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the
authority of the United States, committed within their respective districts, or upon the high seas, the punishment of which
is not capital." There is no act of Congress requiring that

195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the trial of all offenses shall be by jury, and a court is fully
organized and competent for the transaction of business without the presence of a jury. There is no public policy which
forbids the waiver of a jury in the trial of petty offenses.
On the contrary, by section 44 of the Code of Law for the
District of Columbia, Congress provided, in respect to the
Police Court, that"In all prosecutions within the jurisdiction of said court in
which, according to the Constitution of the United States,
the accused would be entitled to a jury trial, the trial shall
be by jury, unless the accused shall in open court expressly
waive such trial by jury and request to be tried by the judge,
in which case the trial shall be by such judge, and the judgment and sentence shall have the same force and effect in all
respects as if the same had been entered and pronounced upon
the verdict of a jury. In all cases where the accused would
not by force of the Constitution of the United States be entitled to a trial by jury, the trial shall be by the court without a jury, unless in such of said last named cases wherein
the fine or penalty may be $50 or more, or imprisonment as
punishment for the offense may be thirty days or more, the
accused shall demand a trial by jury, in which case the trial
shall be by jury."
And it is a well-known fact that in many Territories organized by act of Congress the legislature has authorized the
prosecution of petty offenses in the police courts of cities
without a jury.
But if there be no constitutional or statutory provision or
public policy requiring a jury. in the trial of petty offenses,
upon what ground can it be contended that a defendant therein
may not voluntarily waive a jury ? Can it be that a defendant can plead guilty of the most serious, evern a capital, offense,
and thus dispense with all inquiry by a jury, and cannot when
informed against for a petty offense waive a trial by jury ?
Article six of the amendments, as we have seen, gives the accused a right to a trial by jury. But the same article gives

him the further right "to be confronted with the witnesses

and to have the assistance of counsel."

Is

it possible that an accused cannot admit and be bound by the
admission that a witness not present would testify to certain
facts ? Can it be that if he does not wish the assistance of
counsel and waives it, the trial is invalid ? It seems only
necessary to ask these questions to answer them. When there
is no constitutional or statutory mandate, and no public policy
prohibiting, an accused may waive any privilege which he is
given the right to enjoy. Authorities in the state courts are
in harmony with this thought. In Commonwealth v. Dailey, 12
Cush. 80, the defendant in a misdemeanor case waived his right
to a full panel and consented to be tried by eleven jurors, and
this action was sustained by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. Chief Justice Shaw, delivering the opinion of the court,
said (p. 83): "He may waive any matter of form or substance,
excepting only what may relate to the jurisdiction of the
court." The same doctrine was laid down in Murphy v.
Commonwealth, 1 Met. (Ky.) 365 ; Tyra v. Commonwealth, 2
Met. (Ky.) 1, and in State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa, 578. In
Connelly v. State, 60 Alabama, 89, a statute authorizing the
waiver of a jury was sustained. The same rule was made in
State,v. Worden, 46 Connecticut, 349, which was a case of a
felony. See also People v. Rathbun, 21 Wend. 509, 542.
We are of opinion that the waiver of a jury by the defendants in these cases and the consent to trial by the court was
not in conflict with law, and the judgments are, therefore,
Affirmed.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BROWN and MR. JUSTICE
PECKHAM concur in the views expressed in this opinion, although they dissent from the judgments on the ground of
their dissent in McCray v. United States, ante, p. 64.

gress of August. 2, 1886, entitled "An act defining butter,
also imposing a tax upon and regulating the manufacture,
sale, importation and exportation of oleomargarine," supplemented by the act of October 1, 1890, and amended by the
act of May 9, 1902. 24 Stat. 209, c. 840; 26 Stat. 567,
621, c. 1244, ยง 41; 32 Stat. 193, c. 784.
The informations against Schick and Broadwell were substantially of the same character. Each charged that the defendant, a retail dealer in oleomargarine, unlawfully and
knowingly purchased and received for sale certain oleomargarine which had not been stamped according to law.
The parties, in writing, waived a jury, and agreed to submit the issues to the court. The accused, in each case,
pleaded not guilty. Evidence having been introduced, the
defendant in each case moved the court to render a verdict
and judgment of not guilty and that he be discharged, upon
the ground that the above act of Congress, as amended, was
in contravention of the Constitution of the United States in
that it deprived the defendant and the oleomargarine manufacturers and dealers in the United States of their liberty and
property without due process of law; was an unwarranted
encroachment upon and interference with the police powers
reserved to the several States and to the people of the United
States ; invested an inferior executive officer with the power
finally and arbitrarily to determine judicial questions concerning property rights; and so arbitrarily discriminated against
oleomargarine in favor of butter as to be repugnant to the
fundamental principles of equality and justice that were inherent in the Constitution.
In each case the motion was overruled, the defendant excepting. Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment
having been severally overruled, the court, no jury having been
empanelled, found the defendant, in each case, guilty, and adjudged that he pay a fine of $50 and costs, and that execution
issue therefor. From those judgments the present writs of
error were prosecuted.

The assignments of error here present the same questions
of constitutional law that were raised on the motion to render
judgment for the defendant ; and, in addition, they question
the action of the trial court in striking out and refusing to
consider certain evidence.
Upon the face of the record the question arises whether the
court below, without the aid of a jury, had jurisdiction to
ascertain the facts, and, finding the defendants severally
guilty of the offense charged, to impose upon each the fine
prescribed by the statute.
I. That this is a criminal prosecution, and that the mode
of procedure must be determined by the established rules governing the conduct of trials in criminal cases, is in my judgment not to be doubted. The record itself describes the information as a criminal information, and the case was tried
as if it were a criminal prosecution. It never occurred to
the trial court that it was a prosecution of any other kind.
It is true that the act provides that all fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed by it may be recovered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. ยง 19. But it is evident from the entire
act that it makes all the violations of the provisions imposing a fne, or fine and imprisonment, or fine or imprisonment,
criminal offenses to be punished in such mode as was appropriate or allowable by the law of criminal procedure. Throughout the act, when a fine is imposed, the doing of the thing
forbidden is described as an " offense." If a person carries
on the business of a manufacturer of oleomargarine, without
having paid the special tax, he is subject, besides being liable
to pay the special tax, to be fined not less than $1,000 and
not more than $5,000; if he carries on the business of a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine without having paid the special
tax therefor he is subject, besides being liable for the special
tax, to be fined not less than $500 nor more than $2,000;
and if he carries on the business of a retail dealer in oleomargarine, without having paid the special tax, he may be fined
not less than $50 nor more than $500 for each and every

offense. ยง 4. Every person who knowingly sells or offers for
sale, or delivers or offers to deliver, any oleomargarine in any
other form than in new wooden or paper packages as described,
or who packs in any package any oleomargarine in a manner
contrary to law, or who falsely brands any package or affixes
any stamp on any package denoting a less amount of tax than
that required by law, "may be fined for each offense not more
than $1,000, and be imprisoned not more than two years."
ยง 6. Every manufacturer of oleomargarine who neglects to
affix the required label to a package containing oleomargarine
made by him, or sold or offered for sale by or for him, and
every person who removes any label so affixed may be "fined
$50 for each package in respect to which such offense is committed."
ยง 7. Every officer of customs who permits imported
oleomargarine " to pass out of his custody or control without
compliance by the owner or importer thereof with the provisions of this section relating thereto, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $1,000 nor more
than $5,000, and imprisoned not less than six months nor
more than two years." ยง 10. Any person who wilfully neglects
or refuses, when emptying a stamped package containing
oleomargarine, to utterly destroy such stamps, "shall for
each offense be fined not exceeding $50 and imprisoned not
less than ten days nor more than six months. And any person who fraudulently gives away or accepfs from another, or
who sells, buys, or uses for packing oleomargarine, any such
stamped package, shall for each such offense be fined not exceeding S100 and be imprisoned not more than one year."
ยง 13. Any person who wilfully removes or defaces the stamps,
marks or brands on packages containing oleomargarine taxed
as provided, is guilty "of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, nor more
than two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment for not less
than thirty days nor more than six months." ยง 15. Whenever any person engaged in carrying on the business of manufacturing oleomargarine who defrauds, or attempts to defraud,

the United States of the tax on the oleomargarine produced
by him, or any part thereof, forfeits the factory and manufacturing apparatus used by him, and all oleomargarine and
all raw material for the production of oleomargarine found in
the factory and on the factory premises, and "shall be fined
not less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand
dollars, and be imprisoned not less than six months nor more
than three years." ยง 17.
These sections are to be looked at in connection with section
11, on which this prosecution is based. That section provides "That every person who knowingly purchases or receives for sale any oleomargarine which has not been branded
or stamped according to law, shall be liable to a penalty of
fifty dollars for each such offense."
It is true that the word "penalty" is used in several sections of this act. But it is not to be conclusively inferred
therefrom that the offense described was not a crime, within
the strictest meaning of that word. Referring to the words
"penalty," "liability," and "forfeiture," this court has said:
"These words have been used by the great masters of Crown
law and the elementary writers as synonymous with 'punishment,' in connection with crimes of the highest grade. Thus,
Blackstone speaks of criminal law as that 'branch of jurisprudence which teaches of the nature, extent and degrees of
every crime, and adjusts to it its adequate and necessary penalty.' Alluding to the importance of this department of legal
science, he says : 'The enacting of penalties to which a whole
nation shall be subject should be calmly and maturely considered.' Referring to the unwise policy of inflicting capital
punishmeAt for certain comparatively slight offenses, he speaks
of them as ' these outrageous penalties,' and repeatedly refers
to laws that inflict the 'penalty of death.'

J., dissenting.

ing that there was great danger, when interpreting that maxim,
of being misled by the different shades of meaning allowed
to the word "penal" in our language, this court said: "In
the municipal law of England and America the words 'penal'
and 'penalty' have been used in various senses. Strictly
and primarily, they denote punishment, whether corporal or
pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the State for a crime or offense against its laws.

.

.

.

Penal laws, strictly and properly,

are those imposing punishment for an offense committed against
the State, and which, by the English and American constitutions, the executive of the State has the power to pardon."
Besides the act throughout uses the words " fine," and " fined"
-words which, in their primary sense, import the punishment
of a person convicted of crime.
I cannot doubt, after a scrutiny of the entire act, that every
offense prescribed by it and for which a fine is imposed, was
intended to be made and is a criminal offense-a crime against
the United States-to be punished as such. Certainly the
offenses prescribed in sections four, six, seven, ten, thirteen,
fifteen and seventeen are crimes against the United States.
If that be so, surely the offense prescribed in section 11 is a
crime and not a mere penalty recoverable only by some form
of proceeding of a civil nature. This view is substantially
conceded by the Solicitor General when he says that "in view
of the word 'offense' in section 11 of the oleomargarine act,
there is ground for saying that the penalty which it provides
was imposed as a fine for the violation of what is made a
misdemeanor." If the United States could have proceeded in
some form of civil action to recover the fine imposed by that
section, it has not done so. It chose to proceed by criminal
information, and the accused pleaded not guilty of the crime
charged.
II. So far it has been my object only to show that the offense charged was a crime against the United States. I now
inquire as to the mode in which it may be legally ascertained
whether an accused, pleading not guilty, has committed the

crime charged against him. Has the law designated any
particular tribunal or prescribed any"special mode for trying
the issue of his guilt ? The words of the Constitution upon
this subject are clear and explicit. They leave no room for
interpretation. Its express mandate is that "the trial of all
crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury."
Const. Art. 3. When the Constitution was placed before the
people for adoption or rejection many deemed those words,
explicit as they were, inadequate to secure all the benefits of
a jury trial as it existed at common law.
It is suggested that if any conflict exists between the absolute requirement in the original Constitution, (Art. 3, ยง 2,)
that the "trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment,
shall be by jury," and the provision in the Sixth Amendment,
that the accused, in every criminal prosecution, "shall enjoy
the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,"
etc., the latter, having been last adopted, must control.
But there is no such conflict. Those who opposed the acceptance of the Constitution said, among other things, that
the words of that instrument, strictly construed, (Art. 3,
ยง 2,) admitted of a secret trial, or of one that might be indefinitely postponed to suit the purposes of the Government, or
of one taking place in a State or district other than that in
which the crime was committed. The framers of the Constitution disclaimed any such evil purposes; but in order to meet
the objections of its opponents, and to remove all possible
ground of uneasiness on the subject, the Sixth Amendment
was adopted, in which the essential features of the trial required by section 2 of Article 3 are setforth. In other words,
the trial required by that section is the trial referred to in
the Sixth Amendment. And the jury referred to in both the
original Constitution and in the Amendments was, the authorities all agree, the historical jury of the common law,
consisting of twelve persons, no more and no less, whose unanimous verdict was necessary to conviction.

Law, 123.
The contention in the present prosecutions is that although
the positive constitutional injunction that the trial of all
crimes shall be by jury furnishes an inflexible rule that may
not be ignored in cases of felony, that rule, even where the
accused pleads not guilty, may be disregarded altogether in a
trial for a misdemeanor, provided he consents to be tried by
the court without a jury. Plainly, such an exception is unauthorized by the Constitution if its words be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning. Nor, in my opinion, is it
consistent with the fundamental rules of criminal procedure,
as established and enforced at common law. In determining
the meaning and scope of the words "due process of law," as
used in the Constitution, the established rule is that "we
must examine the Constitution itself, to see whether this
process be in conflict with any of its provisions. If not found
to be so, we must look to those settled usages and modes of
proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors, and which are
shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political
condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country." Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co.,

without a jury-the accused pleading not guilty-we must inquire whether the Constitution forbids such an exercise of authority by the court, without a jury. If it does, that is the
end of the matter; if it does not, then, and then only, may
we look to such usages and modes of proceeding as existed at
the common law for the trial of crimes before the adoption of
the Constitution.
Proceeding on that basis, we have seen that the Constitution expressly requires that the trial of all crimes, except
impeachment, shall be by jury; and I assert, with confidence,
that no precedent can be found at common law for the trial
by the court, without a jury, of any crimes except those described in adjudged cases and by elementary authorities as
minor or petty offenses involved in the internal police of the
State, and those could be tried summarily by some court or
officer without the intervention of a jury only when thereunto authorized by an act of Parliament. Except.in cases of
contempt, the common law, Blackstone says, was a stranger
to the summary proceedings authorized by acts of Parliament. Bk. 4, c 20, 280. I am not aware of, nor has there
been cited, any case in England in which, after Magna Charta
and prior to the adoption of our Constitution, a court, tribunal,
officer, or commissioner has, without a jury, even in the case
of a petty offense, determined the question of crime or no
crime, when the defendant pleaded not guilty, unless the authority to do so was expressly conferred by an act of Parliament.
The exceptions to the rule at common law that all crimes
must be tried by a jury were in the mind of this court when
in Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 557, it said: "Except in
that class or grade of offenses, called petty offenses, which, according to the common law, may be proceeded against summarily in any tribunal legally constituted for that purpose, the
guarantee of an impartial jury to the accused in a criminal
prosecution, conducted either in the name, or by or under the
authority of, the United States, secures to him the right to
enjoy that mode of trial from the first moment, and in what-

ever court, he is put on trial for the offense charged. In
such cases a judgment of conviction, not based upon a verdict of guilty by a jury, is void."
If, in analogy to the powers exercised by the Parliament of
England prior to the adoption of our Constitution, it should
be held that Congress could treat the particular crime here in
question as a petty offense triable by the court, without a
jury, or with a jury of less than twelve persons, it is sufficient to say that Congress has not legislated to that effect
in respect of the offense charged against these defendants,
or of any other offense defined in the acts relating to oleomargarine. If it has the power to do so, Congress has not
assumed, directly or indirectly, to withdraw such offenses
from the operation of the constitutional provision that the
trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be
by jury. And the question is whether in the face of that explicit provision, and in the absence of any statute authorizing it to be done, the court, a jury being waived, had jurisdiction to try the accused for the crime charged.
In this connection we are confronted with the broad statement, found in some adjudged cases as well as in elementary
treatises, to the effect that a person is entitled to waive any
constitutional right, of whatever nature, that he possesses,
and thereby preclude himself from invoking the authority of
the Constitution for the protection or enforcement of that right.
It is suggested that even when charged with murder he may
plead guilty, and that the court thereupon without the intervention of a jury may pronounce such judgment as the law
permits or authorizes. And it is confidently asked by those
who make that suggestion, why may not one charged with a mis-

demeanor, and pleading not guilty, waive a jury altogether
and consent to be tried by the court? This argument will
not stand the test of reason. It proceeds upon the ground
that jurisdiction to try a criminal case may be given by consent of the accused and the prosecutor. But such consent
could have no legal efficacy. Undoubtedly one accused of

murder may plead guilty. But in doing so he renders a trial
unnecessary. The Constitution does not prohibit an accused
from pleading guilty. His right to do so was recognized long
before the adoption of that instrument; and it was never supposed that such a plea impaired the force of the requirement
that a trial for crime, under a plea of not guilty, shall be by
jury. It is not to be assumed that the Constitution intended,
when preserving the right of trial by jury, to change any essential rule of criminal practice established at the common law,
before the adoption of that instrument. When the accused
pleads guilty before a lawful tribunal he admits every material
fact well averred in the indictment or information, and there
is no issue to be tried; no facts are to be found; no trial occurs. After such a plea nothing remains to be done except
that the court shall pronounce judgment upon the facts voluntarily confessed by the accused. What the Constitution requires is that the trial of a crime shall be by jury. If the accused pleads not guilty, there must, of necessity, be a trial;
for by that plea he puts "himself on his country, which country the jury are;" he contests, by that plea, every fact necessary to establish his guilt; he is presumed to be innocent;
nothing is confessed; and the facts necessary to show guilt
must be judicially ascertained, in the mode prescribed by law,
before any judgment can be rendered. But the vital inquiry
is, in what way, when the defendant pleads not guilty, are
the facts to be ascertained and the plea of not guilty overcome?
Under the express words of the Constitution the answer must
be: By trial before a jury of twelve persons organized to determine whether the charge of guilt be true; the function of
the court being simply to conduct the trial and render a judgment in accordance with the verdict of the jury as to the facts.
The court and the jury, not separately but together, constitute
the appointed tribunal which alone, under the law, can try
the question of crime, the commission of which by the accused
is put in issue by a plea of not guilty.
There are some things so vital in their character that they

HAmLAN, J., dissenting.

may not be legally done or legally omitted in a criminal prosecution, even with the consent of the accused. This is abundantly established by authority. The grounds upon which the
decisions rest are, upon principle, applicable alike in cases of
felonies and misdemeanors, although the consequences to the
accused may be more evident as well as more serious in the
former than in the latter cases. Certain it is, that felonies
and misdemeanors are equally crimes within the meaning of
the constitutional provision that the trial of all crimes shall
be by jury, and there is no warrant to construe that provision as if it read, "the trial of all crimes, except in cases of
impeachment and in misdemeanors, shall be by jury."
Let us look at some of the authorities in cases both of felonies and misdemeanors, and ascertain whether the consent,
express or implied, of the accused can have the effect to dispense with the mode of trial appointed by law for criminal
cases. As the question here presented has never been decided
by this court, and is of importance, a somewhat extended reference to authorities is justified.
The first case to which I call attention is Hopt v. Utah, 110
U. S. 574,579. That was a case of murder, arising in Utah while
a Territory. It appeared that the trial, by triers appointed
by the court, of challenges of proposed jurors was not had in
the presence of the accused. It was there argued that his
presence at the trial of such an issue was a privilege which he
was entitled to waive; and that the entire proceedings against
him should not fail because he chose not to exercise that privilege. This court, however, held that the trial of challenges
could not legally take place except in the actual presence
of the accused. In dealing with the suggestion that the right
of the accused to be present before the triers was waived by
his failure to object to their retirement from the court room,
or to the trial of the several challenges in his absence, it
was said: "We are of opinion that it was not within the
power of the accused or his counsel to dispense with the
statutory requirement as to his personal presence at the trial.

The argument to the contrary necessarily proceeds upon the
ground that he alone is concerned as to the mode by which
he may be deprived of his life or liberty, and that the chief
object of the prosecution is to punish him for the crime
charged. But this is a mistaken view as well of the relations
which the accused holds to the public as of the end of human
punishment. The natural life, says Blackstone, 'cannot legally
be disposed of or destroyed by any individual, neither by the
person himself, nor by any other of his fellow creatures, merely
upon their own authority.' 1 Bl. Com. 133. The public has
an interest in his life and liberty. Neither can be lawfully
taken except in the mode prescribed by law. That which the
law -9nakes essential in proceedings involving the deprivation of
life or liberty cannot be dispensed with or affected by the consent
of the accused, much less by his mere failure, when on trial
and in custody, to object to unauthorized methods." 4 Bl.

Com. 11.
In Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 353, which was a case of
grand larceny charged to have been committed while Utah was a
Territory, (the trial occurring after Utah became a State,) one
of the questions was whether the trial by a jury composed
of eight jurors, as authorized by the statutes of the State,
was a legal trial for a crime committed when Utah was a
Territory under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.
It was contended that as the accused did not object, until
after verdict, to a trial by a jury of eight persons, he should
not be heard to say that the trial was in violation of his constitutional rights. This court overruled that contention, saying: "It is sufficient to say that it was not in the power of
one accused of felony, by consent expressly given or by his
silence, to authorize a jury of only eight persons to pass upon
the question of his guilt. The law in force, when this crime
was committed, did not permit any tribunal to deprive him
of his liberty, except one constituted of a court and a jury
of twelve persons." After referring to Hopt v. Utah, above
cited, the court proceeded: " If one under trial for a felony

the punishment of which is confinement in a penitentiary
could not legally consent that the trial proceed in his absence,
still less could he assent to be deprived of his liberty by a
tribunal not authorized by law to determine his guilt."
"The infirmity," say Cooley, "in case of a trial by a jury
of less than twelve, by consent, would be that the tribunal
would be one unknown to the law, created by mere voluntary
act of the parties; and it would be in effect an attempt to
submit to a species of arbitration the question whether the
accused has been guilty of an offense against the State."
Const. Lim. 319.
A leading case is that of Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128,
137. Its doctrines have been widely accepted as based upon a
sound interpretation of constitutional provisions relating to
criminal prosecutions. The Court of Appeals of New York
said: "These considerations make it apparent that the right
of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to affect, by consent, the conduct of the case, should be much more limited
than in civil actions. It should not be permitted to extend
so far as to work radical changes in great and leading provisions as to the organization of the tribunals or the mode of
proceeding prescribed by the constitution and the laws. Effect
may justly and safely be given to such consent in many particulars; and the law does, in respect to various matters, regard and act upon it as valid. Objections to jurors may be
waived; the court may be substituted for triers to dispose of
challenges to jurors; secondary in place of primary evidence
may be received; admissions of facts are allowed; and in similar particulars, as well as in relation to mere formal proceedings generally, consent will render valid, what without it
would be erroneous. A plea of guilty to any indictment,
whatever may be the grade of the crime, will be received and
acted upon if it is made clearly to appear that the nature
and effect of it are understood by the accused. In such a
case the preliminary investigation of a grand jury, with the
admission of the accusation in the indictment, is supposed

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

195 U. S.

to be a sufficient safeguard to the public interests. But
when issue is joined upon an indictment, the trial must be by
the tribunal and in the mode which the constitution and laws
provide, without any essential change. The public officer prosecuting for the people has no authority to consent to such a
change, nor has the defendant. Applying the above reasoning to the present case, the conclusion necessarily follows
that the consent of the plaintiff in error to the withdrawal of
one juror, and that the remaining eleven might render a verdict, could not lawfully be recognized by the court, at the
circuit, and was a nullity. If a deficiency of one juror might
be waived, there appears to be no good reason why a deficiency of eleven might not be; and it is difficult to say why,
upon the same principle, the entire panel might not be dispensed with, and the trial committed to the court alone. It
would be a highly dangerous innovation, in reference to criminal cases, upon the ancient and invaluable institution of
trial by jury, and the constitution and laws establishing and
securing that mode of trial, for the court to allow of any
number short of a full panel of twelve jurors, and we think
it ought not to be tolerated."
Upon the general question whether the consent or silence
of the defendant can excuse the failure of the court at the
trial to enforce such essential rules as are here prescribed by
law for the trial of criminal cases, the case of Hill v. People,
16 Michigan, 351, 356, 357, 358, is instructive. That was
a case of murder. The defendant was found guilty, and
after the trial it was discovered that one of the jurors was
disqualified under the statutes of Michigan. But that fact
was unknown to the accused and his counsel until after the
rendition of the verdict. It was contended by the State
that by neglecting to challenge that juror, the accused lost
the right to avail himself of the objection; and was to be
deemed to have thereby waived all objections to the juror
or to a trial by eleven qualified jurors. It should be here
observed that the Constitution of Michigan preserved the

HARLAN,

J., dissenting.

right, in all criminal prosecutions, to "a speedy and public
trial by an impartial jury, which may consist of less than
twelve men in all courts not of record." Looking at the
case as one in which the trial had been by eleven competent jurors only, the court considered the general question
of waiver as applicable to criminal cases. Speaking by Judge
Christiancy, and observing that under the state constitution
there could be no reasonable doubt of the competency of
parties in civil cases to waive such an objection, or to stipulate for a trial by a jury of less than twelve, the court
said: "But a criminal prosecution, in which the people in
their sovereign capacity prosecute for a crime against the laws
of the whole society, and seek to subject the defendant to punishment, must, it seems to us, be considered as a proceeding in invitum, against the will of the defendant throughout,
so far as relates to a question of this kind, or any question as to the legal constitution of the court or jury by which
he is to be tried. It would be adding materially to the generally recognized force of the obligation of contracts to hold
that a defendant charged with a crime might, -without a trial,
enter into a binding contract with the prosecuting attorney
(representing the State) to go to the penitentiary for a certain number of years in satisfaction for the offense. And yet
it would approximate such a position, to hold that he might
be bound by contract providing for a trial before a court or
jury unknown to the constitution or the laws, the result of
which trial might be to place him in the same penitentiary.
The true theory, we think, is that the people, in their political or sovereign capacity, assume to provide by law the proper
tribunals and modes of trial for offenses, without consulting
the wishes of the defendant as such; and upon them, therefore,
devolves the responsibility, not only of enacting such laws,
but of carrying them into effect, by furnishihg the tribunals,
the panels of jurors, and other safeguards for his trial, in
accordance with the constitution, which secures his rights."
The court added some general observations which may well

195 U. S.

be heeded by every one charged with the administration of
the criminal laws. It said: "But independent of all theories,
and as a practical question, we think there would be great
danger in holding it competent for a defendant in a criminal
case, by waiver or stipulation, to give authority which it could
not otherwise possess, to a jury of less than twelve men, for
his trial and conviction; or to deprive himself in any way of
the safeguards which the constitution has provided him, in
the unanimous agreement of twelve men qualified to serve as
jurors by the general laws of the land. Let it once be settled
that a defendant may thus waive this constitutional right, and
no one can see the extent of the evils which might follow;
but the whole judicial history of the past must admonish us
that very serious evils should be apprehended, and that every
step taken in that direction would tend to increase the danger. One act or neglect might be recognized as a waiver in
one case, and another in another, until the constitutional
safeguards might be substantially fritted away. The only
safe course is to meet the danger in limine, and prevent
the first, step in the wrong direction. It is the duty of courts
to see that the constitutional rights of a defendant in a criminal case shall not be violated, however negligent he may be
in raising the objection. It is in such cases, emphatically,
that consent should not be allowed to give jurisdiction."
In State v. Carman, 63 Iowa, 130, 131, which was the case
of an assault with an attempt to commit murder, the Supreme
Court of Iowa said: "In our Code of Civil Practice it is provided that 'issues of fact in an action in an ordinary proceeding must be tried by a jury, unless the same is waived.'
ยง2740. In our Code of Criminal Procedure there is no provision for the waiver of a jury. On the other hand, it is provided that 'an issue of fact must be tried by a jury of the
county in which the indictment is found, unless a change of
venue has been awarded.' ยง4350. We regard this provision
as excluding the jurisdiction of the court, without a jury, to try
such issue. The question presented is not as to the waiver of

SCHICK v. UNITED STATES.

HARI w, J., dissenting.

a mere statutory privilege, but an imperative provision based,
as we view it, upon the soundest conception of public policy.
Life and liberty are too sacred to be placed at the disposal of
any one man, and always will be, so long as man is fallible.
The innocent person, unduly influenced by his consciousness
of innocence, and placing undue confidence in his evidence,
would, when charged with crime, be the one most easily induced to waive his safeguards. There is no resemblance
between such a case and that of a person pleading guilty.
In the latter case there is no trial, but mere judgment upon
the plea. If the language of the statute were less imperative
than it is, the adjudications would support us in reaching the
same conclusion."
In State v. Mansfield, 41 Missouri, 470, 476, which involved
the question of the right of the accused in capital crimes and
felonies to waive his right to a jury of twelve persons, after
referring to Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128, the Supreme
Court of Missouri, speaking by Judge Wagner, conceded that
in cases of misdemeanor, created by statute, the Legislature,
under the laws of that State, might provide for their prosecution in a summary way, without the formality of an indictment, and that the accused could waive a jury or agree on a
certain number. But there was no such statute in Missouri,
and the court, in respect of the general question of the waiver
of a jury, said: "Another good and sufficient reason, it occurs
to us, is, that the prisoner's consent cannot change the law.
His right to be tried by a jury of twelve men is not a mere
privilege; it is a positive requirement of the law. He can unquestionably waive many of his legal rights or privileges. He
may agree to certain facts and dispense with formal proofs;
he may consent to the introduction of evidence not strictly
legal, or forbear to interpose challenges to the jurors; but he
has no power to consent to the creation of a new tribunal unknown to the law- to try his offense. The law in its wisdom
has declared what shall be a legal jury in the trial of criminal
cases; that it shall be composed of twelve; and a defendant,

when he is upon trial, cannot be permitted to change the law,
and substitute another and a different tribunal to pass upon his
guilt or innocence. The law as to criminal trials should be
based upon fixed standards, and should be clear, definite and
uniform, and absolute. If one juror can be withdrawn, there
is no reason why six or eight may not be, and thus the accused
through persuasion or other causes may have his life put in
jeopardy, or be deprived of his liberty, through a body constituted in a manner unknown to the law. Aside from the
illegality of such a procedure, public policy condemns it. The
prisoner is not in a condition to exercise a free and independent choice without often creating prejudice against him."
In Wilson v. State, 16 Arkansas, 601, 608, which was a case
of larceny, the Supreme Court of Arkansas said: "Hence
there would seem to be no other mode for the trial of a criminal issue, than that by jury. The difficulty is not obviated
by any waiver of this mode of trial, because the Legislature
has provided no other mode, in lieu oj it, in such an event, as
it has in civil cases. Nothing short of a confession of the facts,
or the finding of them by the verdict of the jury, can regularly
authorize the judgment of the court. If the accused would
not only waive his right to a trial- by jury, but go further,
and withdraw his plea, and then confess the facts charged
against him in the indictment, the court would be authorized
to render a judgment against him; but so long as his plea
of not guilty is in, there is no mode by which the court can
dispose of it, although the accused may waive a trial by jury,
with all its attendant privileges, and desire ever so much that
the issue may be disposed of by a reference of it to the judge,
or any other referee or arbitrator, and the prosecuting attorney may desire the same, and act in concert with the accused; for the simple reason that the law makes no provision
for any such referee or arbitrator in criminal cases. The
only provision is for a confession of the facts, or a trial by
jury to determine them."
A leading case upon the subject of trial by jury is that of

SCHICK v. UNITED STATES.
195 U. S.

HAmLA-,

J., dissenting.

Work v. State of Ohio, 2 Ohio St. 296, 302, 305. That was
an information charging the defendant with assault and battery. The trial took place under an act of the Ohio.legislature which permitted a trial in such a case by a jury of six
men, notwithstanding the Constitution of Ohio provided that
the right of trial by jury should be inviolate. The defendant pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty and sentenced
to pay a fine of $100 and costs. In discussing the history of
trial by jury, the court, speaking by Judge Ranney, said:
"In what does the privilege of this great bulwark of personal liberty consist ? The constitution furnishes no answer,
nor was it necessary that it should. If ages of uninterrupted
use can give significance to language, the right of jury trial
and the habeas corpus stand as representatives of ideas as
certain and definite as any other in the whole range of legal
learning. The institution of the jury, referred to in our
constitution, and its benefits secured to every person accused
of crime, is precisely the same in every substantial respect,
as that recognized in the great charter, and its benefits secured to the freemen of England, and again and again acknowledged in fundamental compacts as the great safeguard of
life, liberty, and property: The same, brought to this continent by our forefathers, and perseveringly claimed as their
birthright, in every contest with arbitrary power, and finally,
an invasion of its privileges prominently assigned as one of
the causes which was to justify them in the eyes of mankind
in waging the contest which resulted in independence. .
We are of opinion it was this very tribunal, thus constituted,
that those who framed and adopted the constitution of this
State intended to perpetuate, and make the safeguard of innocence, by securing its benefits to every person accused of
crime, in any of its courts. There is certainly nothing in our
history which points to a different conclusion. For half a
century before its adoption, similar provisions had been so
considered and acted upon. Until the passage of this law,
no person had ever been convicted of crime, by less than the

concurring assent of twelve of his peers; and no law had ever
attempted to authorize it to be done. If the power exists to
diminish the number of the jury, it may be applied to all
cases, and it may be reduced to two as well as to six. The
same constitutional provision that secures the right in a charge
involving the life of the accused, secures it also in every other
criminal case. It is no answer to say that this would not
likely be done. If it had been deemed safe to leave it to the
discretion of the General Assembly, no constitutional provision was needed; but, whether needed or not, it has been
ordained by a power which both the General Assembly and
this court are bound to obey." Again: "But, without pursuing these considerations further, our opinion is, that the
essential and distinguishing features of the trial by jury as
known at the common law, and generally, if not universally,
adopted in this country, were intended to be preserved, and
its benefits secured to the accused in all criminal cases, by
the constitutional provision referred to. That it is beyond
the power of the General Assembly to impair the right, or
materially change its character; that the number of jurors
cannot be diminished, or a verdict authorized short of a
unanimous concurrence of all the jurors. It follows that the
act under which this conviction was obtained, in so far as it
provides for a jury of six only, and authorizes a conviction
upon their finding, is unconstitutional and void."
In United States v. Taylor, 11 Fed. Rep. 470, which was a
criminal prosecution by information for the offense of carrying on the business of a retail dealer in liquors without having paid the special taxes required by law, the main question
was as to the authority of the court to direct a verdict of
guilty under the evidence. It was held by Judge McCrary
that no such power existed in the court. In the course of
his opinion he said that the constitutional guaranty of a jury
in a criminal case was a right that could not be waived, and
that such a trial before the court by the prisoner's consent was
erroneous. It appears from the report of that case that Mr.

Justice Miller was consulted by Judge McCrary and concurred
in the latter's views.
Among the cases cited by Judge McCrary was State v. Maine,
27 Connecticut, 281, which was a criminal information for placing a nuisance in a highway. The defendant pleaded not guilty.
The case, by agreement of the parties, was tried by the court,
which found the facts, and reserved the questions of law
arising thereon for the advice of the Supreme Court of Errors.
The judges of the latter court unanimously held that, "as no
statute conferred on the superior court the power to try this or
any other criminal charge, excepting through the intervention of
a jury, the court below could not legally try the case in the
manner in which it had done, and would not be able to render a legal judgment on the facts, if the advice of this court
was given upon them. They therefore refused to entertain
the case."
In Neales v. The State, 10 Missouri, 498, which is an indictment for unlawfully carrying on the business of a dram-shop
keeper without having a license therefor, it appears that the
defendant pleaded not guilty, and neither party requiring a
jury, the case was submitted to the court, who found him
guilty and assessed a fine of $30 against him. The Supreme
Court of Missouri, in which State there was a constitutional
provision providing that the right of trial by jury should
remain inviolate, said: "Another objection, equally fatal to
the judgment, was the trial of the cause by the court, on the
plea of not guilty. It has heretofore been virtually decided
by this court, in two cases, that unless the defendant pleads
guilty to the charge contained in the indictment, the court
cannot try the issue and assess a fine against him. 6 Missouri,
457; 9 Missouri, 696. It is exclusively the province of a jury
to try the issue of not guilty, and the consent of the defendant for
the court to try the same, cannot confer such power upon the
court.'
A case directly in point is that of State v. Stewart, 89 N. Car.
563, 564. That was an indictment for an assault and battery.

The defendant pleaded not guilty. A jury trial was waived,
the court found the facts and adjudged the accused guilty.
The judgment was arrested and the State appealed. The
Supreme Court of North Carolina said: "It is a fundamental
principle of the common law, declared in 'Magna Charta,' and
again in our Bill of Rights, that 'no person shall be convicted
of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good
and lawful men in open court.' Art. I, ยง 13. The only exception to this is where the Legislaturemay provide other means of
trial for petty misdemeanors with the right of appeal-Proviso
in same section. This is not one of the petty misdemeanors
embraced in the proviso; and if it was, no such means of trial
as that adopted in this case has been provided by the legislature. The court here has undertaken to serve in the double capacity of judge and jury, and try the defendant without a jury,
which it had no authority to do, even with the consent of the
prisoner."
Later, in State v. Holt, 90 N. Car. 749, 754--which was an
indictment for cruelty to animals-the same court, after observing that it was the province and duty of the judiciary to
watch over and protect the fundamental rights, in all matters
that come before them, said: "There was not the remotest
purpose in this case, we are sure, to infringe the right of trial
by jury in a criminal action, but for convenience sake and to
save time (because the facts were not disputed) the facts of
the case were agreed upon by the State and the defendant,
and submitted to the judge, instead of letting a jury hear the
evidence, and render a verdict upon the issue, or find a special verdict. In our judgment, this was not only irregular,
but wholly without the sanction of law. There is no statute
that authorizes such procedure, and the constitution forbids it.
'No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court.'
No jury was empaneled to try the issue; there was no verdict
of a jury; there was no conviction. The judgment of the
court had nothing to warrant it, and there was nothing upon

which it could properly rest. The defendant could not consent
to a conviction by the co t. It had no authority to try the issue
of fact raised by the pleadings. The defendant did not plead
guilty; he did not enter the plea of nolo contendere, or submit;
he pleaded autrefois convict, and a jury must try the issue
raised by that plea. State v. Stewart, 89 N. Car. 563; State v.
Moss, 2 Jones, 66; 1 Bish Cr. P1. ยง 759, and cases there cited;
Canemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128. The legislature has not provided a means for the trial of cases like this, different from the
ordinary method provided by law. The court erred in passing
upon the facts agreed upon and submitted to it without the
finding of a jury, and for such error the judgment must be
reversed and the court proceed to dispose of the case according to law."
Running through the adjudged cases is the thought that
the facts necessary to be proved in order to sustain the charge
of crime, where the plea is not guilty, must be ascertained in
the mode ordained by law for such purpose. "When, therefore," says Blackstone, "a prisoner on his arraignment pleads
not guilty, and for his trial hath put himself on his country,
which country the jury are, the sheriff of the county must return
a panel of jurors, liberos et legales homines,de vicineto." Bk. 4,
c. 27, *350. Now, all will agree that when the crime charged
is a felony, a trial in S Circuit or District Court of the United
States, even with the consent of the accused, without a jury
composed of twelve persons, would be unauthorized and unavailing for any legal purpose. Why? Because, and only because, the law, the supreme law of the land, has declared that
the trial of all crimes shall be by jury. And, perhaps, all
will agree that the -constitutional injunction applies with like
force to such misdemeanors as by statute are punishable with
imprisonment, and that a Circuit or District Court of the
United States is without jurisdiction, under a plea of not
guilty, no jury being impaneled, to try any crime against the
United States involving life or liberty. The consent of the accused in such a case certainly cannot confer upon the court

authority to try the crime in a mode inconsistent with the
one prescribed by the law.
In my judgment, the same principle must apply in the
present case, although a fine only can be imposed. The case
is embraced by the very words of the Constitution; for the
offense charged is a crime-none the less a crime because
only a fine is involved-and the constitutional mandate
is that the trial of all crimes, except impeachment, shall
be by jury. By what authority can a Federal court except
from the operation of the constitutional mandate a crime punishable by fine ? It is said that only the property of the accused can be affected, and, therefore, to his consent in this
criminal case should be accorded the same effect as is given
to his consent in a purely civil case to which he might be a
party, and which involved no element of crime. In this view
I cannot occur. Something more than property is involved
in a criminal case, although the penalty imposed may be
simply a fine. Whether the accused has violated the laws of
his country, and whether he shall be branded by the judgment of a court as a criminal, are things of more consequence
to the public than property the value of which is to be measured in money. What shall constitute a crime, how that
crime shall be tried, and in what way the guilt of the accused shall be manifested, when he pleads not guilty, are exclusively for the Government to declare and regulate, and it
is not for the accused, and the prosecutor, by the device of
an agreement between them, to evade the requirements of the
Constitution and provide a tribunal for the determination of
the issue of crime or no crime different from that designated
by the law. Crime or no crime, if the plea be not guilty, can
be established in a court of the United States only by the
verdict of a jury.
Undoubtedly, as already indicated, there were petty or
minor crimes which, at common law, could be tried without
a jury, and it may be assumed for the purposes of this case,
that the constitutional provision that all crimes except im-

J., dissenting.

peachment shall be tried by jury is to be interpreted in the
light of that fact. But, it may be repeated, that the trial,
even of such cases, without a jury, was contrary to the genius of the common law, and was allowed by the courts only
in obedience to acts of Parliament,which was not bound by a
written constitution, and whose authority in matters of legislation was omnipotent, and, therefore, not to be disputed by
an English court. An enumeration of all the crimes against
the United States which may be reasonably declared to belong to the class known at the common law as petty offenses,
punishable under legislative sanction without the intervention
of a jury, need not here be attempted. Nor is it necessary to
express any final judgment upon the question whether the
particular crime here involved might, by statute, be placed in
that class and tried without a jury. It is enough to say that
even if Congress could place it in that class, and authorize its
trial by summary proceedings, without a jury, or with a jury
of less than twelve, it has not done so. The case, therefore, is
controlled by the express constitutional injunction that all
crimes, except in case of impeachment, shall be tried by a
jury. The agreement of the accused and the prosecutor
cannot confer jurisdiction, much less have the effect to displace the mode of trial established by the fundamental law
and substitute for it one inconsistent with the principles of
the common law as unmodified by any valid statute.
It is said that the nature of the offense and the amount of
punishment prescribed must determine whether it is to be
classed among serious or petty offenses. This, I take it,
means that it is for the court, in the exercise of its inherent
powers, to determine whether the offense is a serious one to
be tried alone by a jury, or a petty one which may be tried
without a jury. But the judiciary had no such function at
common law. No court at common law assumed, without
a jury, to try any offense, however trivial or petty, except
under the authority of a statute conferring authority to that
end. If the offense is punishable only by a fine of fifty dolVOL. CXCV-7

lars-as is the case here-is it to be deemed a petty offense,
and yet is one punishable by a fine of five hundred dollars to
be deemed a serious one? Must there not be some fixed rule
or limit on the subject? In my judgment, the Constitution
establishes a rule which must be respected by every branch
of the Government. Yet, under the principles now announced, an offense punishable by a fine of five or ten thousand dollars may be regarded-if the court so wills-as a
petty offense, triable without a jury. I cannot understand
where the judiciary derives its authority to prescribe any
rule on the ยงubject, in face of the absolute constitutional requirement that all crimes, except in cases of impeachment,
shall be tried by a jury, and in face of the further significant
fact that no court at common law ever assumed to regard
any crime, however trivial, as triable without a jury, except
under express legislative sanction.
Again, it is said that in the original draft of the Constitution, the words were "the trial of all criminal offenses
shall be by jury," and that these words were changed in the
Convention so as to read "the trial of all crimes." Strangely
enough, it is supposed that this change of words justifies the
conclusion that the framers of the Constitution intended to
dispense with a jury in such criminal offenses as the courts,
uncontrolled by statute, deemed petty as contrasted with
those that they deemed serious. To say that "crimes" means
something different from "criminal offenses" is something
that I cannot comprehend. A crime is a criminal offense and
a criminal offense is a crime. But the contention of the
prosecution, even if sound, does not answer the suggestion
that, at comnmon law, it was never the province of a court,
by any inherent power it possessed, to prescribe what criminal offenses or crimes were triable, and what need not be
tried, by jury. My point is that no criminal offense or crime
against the United States can be tried except by jury, if the
plea be not guilty, unless it be a petty offense or crime, and
unless the legislative department declares that it may be so

tried. If the offense or crime be, in reality, in its essence, a
petty one, then Congress may authorize it to be tried without
a jury. But Congress has not so declared in respect of the
offense or crime charged against the piesent defendant. The
trial by jury is not one of form, but of the very substance of
the mode prescribed for the trial of crimes. It may not be
waived merely by the consent of the accused and the prosecutor. In the present case the court, as I think, entrenches
upon the domain of the legislative department of the Government. It assumes, without authority, to prescribe a rule of
criminal procedure which Congress has not, in its wisdom,
undertaken to prescribe. It has made, not declared, law.
There is no tendency, in these latter days, more dangerous
than the assumption by one department of the Government
of powers that belong to another department.
It is contended that this mode of trial, at least in misdemeanors involving only a fine, ought to be sanctioned-indeed, encouraged-as convenient both for the Government
and the accused. What was said by Blackstone when referring to summary proceedings authorized by acts of Parliament in particular cases may well be repeated, at this day,
whenever it is proposed, upon grounds of convenience, to
dispense with juries in criminal prosecutions, and thereby
introdice a new mode for the trial of crimes. He said:
"And, however convenient these may appear at first (as
doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most
convenient) yet let it be again remembered, that delays and
little inconveniences in the forms of justice are the price
that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally opposite to the spirit
of our Constitution; and that though begun in trifles, the
precedent may gradually increase and spread, to the utter
disuse of juries in questions of the most momentous concern." Bk. 4, c. 27, 350.
I insist that as the offense charged in each of these cases

was a crime against the United States; as the Constitution
expressly declares, without qualification, that the trial of all
crimes, except impeachment, shall be by jury; as Congress
has not assumed to declare that this case and like ones may
be tried without a jury, the parties assenting; and as the
trial of these cases bi the court alone, without a jury, has
no other sanction than the consent of the accused and the
District Attorney, the judgment in each case should be reversed, and each case remanded with directions to set aside
the judgment, grant a new trial, and take such further proceedings as may be in conformity with law.
KEPNER v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
No. 244. Argued April 22, 1904.-Decided Iay 31,1904.

The expressed declarations of the President in Military Order, No. 58, of
April 23, 1900, and in the act of July 1, 1902, establishing a civil government in the Philippine Islands, both adopting with little alteration
the provisions of the Bill of Rights, show' that it was intended to carry
to the Philippine Islands those principles of our Government which the
President declared to be established as rules of law for the maintenance
of individual freedom; and those expressions were used in the sense which
has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they
were taken.
It is a well settled rule of construction that language used in a statute which
has a settled and well known meaning, sanctioned by judicial decision,
is presumed to be used in that sense by the legislative body.
It is a well settled principle of construction that specific terms covering
the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same
or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.
Although a right of appeal was given to the Government by Military Order,
No. 58, in criminal cases in the Philippine Islands, ยง 5 of the act of July 1,
1902, establishing a civil government in the Islands, specifically provided
that no person should be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense,
thereby repealing the provision in the military order and nothing in ยง 9
of the act of 1902 can be construed as intending to prevail over the
specific guaranty contained in ยง 5.
In ascertaining the meaning of a phrase in the Constitution taken from
the Bill of Rights, it must be construed with reference to the common
law from which it was taken.
