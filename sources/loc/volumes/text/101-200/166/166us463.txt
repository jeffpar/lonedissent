MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS

delivered the opinion of the court.

The bills of complaint in these cases are substantially of the
same legal import, so far as any Federal question is concerned,
with that considered in the case of The First National Bank
of Aberdeen v. The Couhty of ClJehalis, ante, 440, in which the
opinion of this court has just been delivered.
The only difference that we notice is that, in connection
with the allegation that there existed large amounts of taxable moneyed capital owned by resident citizens and invested
in interest-bearing loans and securities, there is made the ad-

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Syllabus.

ditional allegation that all of said other moneyed capital referred to was all the moneyed capital in the city owned by
resident individual citizens and invested in interest-bearing
loans, discounts and securities, except that invested in incorporated banks located in the city.
It is not perceived that this additional allegation calls for
any different conclusion than the one reached in the previous
case. We are still uninformed whether the moneyed capital
left unassessed was, as to any material portion thereof, moneyed capital coming into competition with that of national
banks. The averment that the moneyed capital exempted
was "taxable" does not enable us to say that it therefore
consisted of investments within the meaning of the term
moneyed capital" as used in the act of Congress.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is, in
each case,

No. 242.

Argued March 2D,1897,-

Decided April 12, 1897.

The statute of the Territory of Utah (Compiled Laws of 1888, ยง 3371, as
amended in 1892) providing that " in all civil cases a verdict may be

rendered on the concurrence therein of nine or more members of the
jury," if not invalid under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution,
is so as violating the provision in the act of September 9,1850, c. 51, admitting Utah as a Territory, that '' the Constitution and laws of the United
States are hereby extended over and declared to be in force in said Territory of Utah, so far as the same or any provisions thereof may be applicable," and the act of April 7, 1874, c. 80, "concerning the practice in
territorial courts, and appeals therefrom," which provided that no party
