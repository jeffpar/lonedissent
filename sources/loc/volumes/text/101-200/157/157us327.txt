No. 13S.

COURT

OF

THE

IMPROVEMENT

UNITED

STATES

FOR

DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN.

Argued January 18, 1695.-Decided March 25, 1895.

Although section 3186 of the Revised Statutes of Wisconsin may have
enlarged the ordinary equitable action to quiet title and remove a cloud,
the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting in that District, may take
jurisdiction of a bill properly brought under its provisions.
A person in possession, claiming under a tax deed, under which he had obtained title, may institute such a suit.
The jurisdiction of a suit so instituted is not affected by the provision
in section 1197 of the Revised Statutes of Wisconsin of 1878 conferring
for three years a right of action by the grantee in a tax deed against the
owner to bar him and his grantees from claiming the land, nor by the
.provisions of ยง 22, c. 138, of the Revised Statutes of 1858.
Questions affecting the validity of a tax deed of real estate in a State must
be disposed of in accordance with the interpretation of the statutes of
the State by its highest judicial tribunal.
In Wisconsin when a tax deed is in due form and recorded in the proper
office, and the lands described therein remain vacant and unoccupied for
three years or more after the recording thereof, the tax title claimant is
deemed to be in constructive possession, the statute of limitations runs
in his favor, and the original owner is barred from attacking the validity
of the tax deed.
The introduction of certain evidence by the appellee held not to be a waiver
of its right to rely on the statute of limitations.
In considering the acts and proceedings of county boards acting under Rev.
Stats. Wis. of 1858, c. 13, ยง 28, they must be liberally construed.
The Revised Statutes of Wisconsin of 1858 provided that the register of deeds
should keep a general index, each page of which should be divided into
eight columns, with heads to the respective columns, as follows: "Time
of reception. Name of grantor. Name of grantee. Description of land.
Name of instrument. Volume and page where recorded. To whom delivered. Fees received;" that such register should make correct entries
in said index of every instrument or writing received by him for record,
under the respective and appropriate heads, entering the names of the
grantors in alphabetical order; and should immediately, upon the receipt
of any such instrument or writing for record, enter in the appropriate
column and in the order in which it was received the day, hour, and
innute of its reception, and the same should be considered as recorded

at the time so noted. By section 759 of the Revised Statutes of 1878 it
is directed that,the division shall be into nine columns, the first column
being headed: "lmnber of instrument," and the others as in the act of
1858. In this case the tax deed was entered in the index under the name
of Douglas County by which it was issued, althoughi running in the name
of the State as well as of the county. The original index had the eight
divisions required by the statute, but the fourth column, under the heading "Description" was subdivided as shown in the opinion. This index becoming dilapidated was laid aside, and a new one was prepared under the
provisions of the laws of 1860, c. 201, which complied with the provisions
of the statute in that respect, and was substituted for the original.

field,
(1) That it was not necessary to insert in the index the name of the
State as a grantor;
(2) That taking the page of the original index as a whole, no one could
be misled by it who was not wilfully misled, and it was sufficient
to set the statute of limitations in operation;
(3) That the new and correct index, having been properly certified to
according to law, was from that date as effective as the original;
(4) That the appellant could not question the complainant's title on the
ground of informality in the original.

Tyns was a bill in equity, filed under section 3186 of the
Revised Statutes of the State of Wisconsin, by the Land and
River Improvement Company, a. corporation of New Jersey,
against Thomas Bardon, a citizen of the State of Wisconsin,
in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western
District of Wisconsin, to have certain conveyances declared
void and to quiet the title to the southeast quarter of section 28,
township 49 N., range 14 W., in Douglas County, Wisconsin.
The section in question is as follows:
"SEC. 3186. Any person having the possession and legal
title to land may institute an action against any other person
setting up a claim thereto, and if the plaintiff shall be able
to substantiate his title to such land, the defendant *shallbe
adjudged to release to the plaintiff all claim thereto, and to
pay the costs of such action, unless the defendant shall, by
answer, disclaim all title to such land, and give a release
thereof to the plaintiff, in which case he shall recover costs,
unless the court shall otherwise order. It shall be sufficient
to aver in the complaint in such action the nature and extent
of the plaintiff's estate in such land, describing it as accurately

Statement of the Case.

as may be, and that he is in possession thereof, and that the
defendant makes some claim thereto, and to demand judgment
that the plaintiff's claim be established against any claim of
the defendant, and that he be forever barred against having
or claiming any right or title to the land, adverse to the
plaintiff; and the defendant, if he do not so disclaim and
release, may answer any matter in denial of the plaintiff's
claim, title, or possession, or which, if proved, will establish
his own, and judgment shall be rendered according to the
rights of the parties. And any person not having such title
or possession, but being the owner and holder of any lien or
incumbrance on land, shall also have the same right of action
as the owner in fee in possession, to test the legality and
validity of any other claim, lien or incumbrance on such
land or any part thereof."
Complainant purchased the land of one Hiram Hayes and
paid him therefor $6400, June 2, 1883, and took a warranty
deed of conveyance and had paid the taxes since that time
and expended on the land up to 1890, including the taxes of
1889, something over $12,500. Hayes derived title through
two tax deeds issued to him, one dated September 5, 1870,
for the taxes of 1866, recorded September 7, 1870, and the
other issued January 1, 1882, for the taxes of 1877, and
recorded January 3, 1882. The original owner of the land
was one James D. Ray, who conveyed it to James Bardon by
release or quitclaim on March 6, 1878, and James Bardon
subsequently conveyed it to Thomas Bardon, the defendant,
for a iaominal consideration. James Bardon testifies that he
paid Ray for his quitclaim deed $100, "and perhaps more;"
and conveyed his interest to Thomas without money consideration. The case turned upon the validity of these tax deeds
or either of them, and the Circuit Court held that the deed
dated September 5, 1870, was valid; that the statute of
limitations had run upon it; that the original owner was
barred; and that complainant's title was good. A decree
was accordingly entered for complainant, to review which
this appeal is prosecuted. The opinion of the Circuit Court
will be found, 45 Fed. Rep. 706.

We remarked in Go'mley v. Clark, 134 U. S. 338, 348, that
while the rule was well settled that remedies in the courts of
the United States at common law or in equity, according t&
the essential character of the case, are uncontrolled in that
particular by the practice of the state courts, yet an enlargement of equitable rights by state statutes may be administered by the Circuit Courts of the United States, as well as
by the courts of the State; and when the case is one of a
remedial proceeding, essentially of an equitable character,
there can be no objection to the exercise of the jurisdiction.
Broderick Will Case, 21 Wall. 503, 520; Holland v. challen,
110 U. S. 15, 25; .F'rostv. Spitley, 121 U. S. 552, 557.
Notwithstanding the statute may have enlarged the ordinary equitable action to quiet title and to remove a cloud, the
Circuit Court had jurisdiction to award the relief prayed if
the bill were properly brought under the section in question;
and, as that section provided that any person having the
possession and legal title might institute the suit, we perceive
no reason why the complainant could not, if it were in possession, as is conceded, and had obtained the legal title through
either of the tax deeds, a matter to be hereafter examined.
Section 35 of chapter 22 of the General Laws of Wisconsin
of 1859, reenacted as section 1197 of the Revised Statutes of
1878, (Gen. Laws Wis. 1859, p. 21; Rev. Stat. Wis. 1878, c.
50, p. 383,) provided that the grantee in a tax deed might, at
any time within three years after its date, commence an
action against the owner or any person claiming under him
for the purpose of barring such owner or his grantees from
all right, title, interest, or claim in the land conveyed, and it

Opinion of the Court.

is argued that that remedy was exclusive, and not having
been availed of by Hayes, that complainant cannot maintain
this suit. But there is nothing in the statute to show that
the remedy existing during three years after the date of the
tax deed was intended to contract the jurisdiction and practice in equity, independently of statute, in respect of bills to
quiet title, or to exclude the general remedy given by section
3186, (a remedy existing in Wisconsin since 1858, ยง 29, c. 141,
Rev. Stat. 1858,) in favor of a person having the legal title
and actual possession, though that legal title depended on a
tax deed. Stridde v. Saroni, 21 Wisconsin, 173; Grimmer v.
Sumner, 21 Wisconsin, 179; Trals v. Grosvenor, 31 Wisconsin,
681; Grignon v. Black, 76 Wisconsin, 674.
Nor can we regard the position of appellant that this
suit was barred under section 22 of chapter 138 of the Revised
Statutes of 1858 as tenable. That section provided that "an
action for relief not hereinbefore provided for, must be commenced within ten years after the cause of action shall have
accrued," and the enumerated actions apparently did not
include this suit. But this alleged limitation was not set up
in the answer or the question raised in any way so far as
appears, in the Circuit Court, and, if so, comes too late. And,
apart from that, actual possession was not taken until October
13, 1889, and the bill was filed November 1, 1889.
We proceed then to the objections urged to the validity of
the tax deed of September 5, 1870, and these must be disposed
of, in accordance with the interpretation of the statutes of
Wisconsin, by the highest judicial tribunal of that State. As
was observed in Lewis v. M2unson, 151 U. S. 545, 549: "No
question is more clearly a matter of local law than one arising
under the tax laws. Tax proceedings are carried on by the
State for the purpose of collecting its revenue, and the various
steps which shall be taken in such proceedings, the force and
effect to be given to any act of the taxing officers, the results
to follow the non-payment of taxes, and the form and efficacy
of the tax deed, are all subjects which the State has power to
prescribe, and peculiarly and vitally affecting its well-being.
The determination of any questions affecting them is a matter

primarily belonging to the courts of the State, and the
national tribunals universally follow their rulings except in
cases where it is claimed that some right protected by the
Federal constitution has been invaded."
Under the laws of Wisconsin the owner of land sold for
taxes might, at any time within three years from date of the
certificate of sale, redeem the same in the manner prescribed,
and in like manner redeem at any time before the tax deed
executed upon such sale was recorded. Gen. Laws Wis. 1859,
c. 22, ยงยง 18, 19 ; Rev. Statutes of 1878, ยง 1165.
By section 25, c. 22, of the laws of 1859, carried forward
into section 1176 of the Revised Statutes of 1878, it was
provided that the tax deed, "duly witnessed and acknowledged, shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity of all
the proceedings, from the valuation of the land by the assessor
inclusive, up to the execution of the deed, and may be recorded
with like effect as other conveyances of land."
Section 5 of chapter 138 of the laws of 1861 provided that
no action should be commenced by the former owner to recover
possession of land which had been sold and conveyed for nonpayment of taxes or to avoid the deed, unless the action should
be commenced within three years next after the recording of
the deed. Rev. Stat. 1878, ยง 1188.
By section 32 of chapter 22 of the laws of 1859 it was
enacted that no action should be maintained by the grantee
in a tax deed or any one claiming under him, to recover the
possession of the land described therein unless such action
should be brought within three years next after the date of
the recording of such deed, or unless such grantee or those
claiming under him shall have paid the taxes assessed on such
land for five years next after the date of such deed, or unless
such grantee, or those claiming under him, had been in actual,
continual possession of said land claiming title for three years
previous to the expiration of five years next after the date of
such deed. Rev. Stat. 1878, ยง 1187.
The rule may be accepted as thoroughly settled by the
decisions of the Sfipreme Court of Wisconsin that when a tax
deed is in due form and recorded in the proper office and the

Opinion of the Court.

lands described therein remain vacant and unoccupied for
three years or more after the recording thereof, the tax title
claimant is deemed to be in the constructive possession, the
statute runs in his favor, and the original owner is barred
from attacking its validity. Geekie v. Kirby Capenter Co.,
106 U. S. 379 ; Gunnison v. Jloehne, 18 Wisconsin, 268 ; -Lawrence v. Kenney, 32 Wisconsin, 281; St. Croix Co. v. Ritchie,
73 Wisconsin, 409; Dipen v. Wetherby, 79 Wisconsin, 203;
-Landerv. Bromley, 79 Wisconsin, 372; liotson v. Wet]erby,
60 N. W. Rep. 4:23; Oconto Co. v. Jerrard,46 Wisconsin, 317,
327. In the last case Chief Justice Ryan said: "It has been
uniformly held, in a multitude of cases, that, as against the
grantee of a tax deed, the statute puts at rest all objections
against the validity of the tax proceedings, whether resting
on mere irregularity or going to the groundwork of the tax.
The statute makes a deed valid on its face prina facie
evidence, as soon as executed, of the regularity of all the
proceedings, from the assessment of the lands, inclusive, to the
execution of the deed. And the effect of all the decisions is,
that when the statute has run in favor of the grantee, the
deed becomes conclusive to the same extent. See Edgerton v.
Bird, 6 Wisconsin, 527, and the cases collected in the note of
Vilas & Bryant; Lawrence v. Ifenney, 32 Wisconsin, 281;
Wood v. Meyer, 36 Wisconsin, 308."
Here the land was vacant and unoccupied for more than
three years from the time of the record of the tax deed, and
if that deed was not void upon its face and was properly
recorded it would follow that, under these decisions, Hayes
obtained the legal title. With the record of the deed the
time of redemption ended and the period of limitation began.
]Before the deed was recorded the owner might tender the
redemption money and defeat the tax title, and at any time
within three years after record he might bring suit to impeach
the tax deed, or make defence to suit against him, by proof
of defects in the proceedings upon which it was based. But
after the expiration of three years, the statute purged the tax
proceedings of all defects, and the deed could only be attacked
on the ground of want of power to levy and sell by reason of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

payment of taxes, lack of jurisdiction in the taxing officers,
or the like.
On behalf of the appellant a great variety of objections is
urged to the validity of the tax deeds and proceedings, many
of which are not open to consideration, if the deed was not
void on its face and was duly recorded. It is, indeed, contended that appellee, by the introduction of certain evidence,
waived its right to reply on the statute of limitations and the
conclusive effect of the deed, but we do not think this contention can be sustained. The evidence referred to was
adduced in rebuttal or in support of complainant's general
equities, and although formal defects in the proceedings may
have been disclosed, we cannot hold that the door for an
attack thereon was thereby intentionally opened, which the
statute had effectually closed. Still less, in a case where the
right, as well as the remedy, had been extinguished if complainant's position were as claimed. Lefingwell v. Tfrairren,
2 Black, 599. We regard the deed as valid on its face, and
cannot accept the suggestion that this is not so because too
literally following the statutory form. The recital as to
redemption was: "And whereas it further appears, as the
fact is, that the owner or owners or claimant or claimants of
said lands has or have not redeemed from said sale the lands
which were sold as aforesaid, and said lands are now unredeemed from such sale,
"
The meaning is clear that
there had been no redemption by the owner or owners or
claimant or claimants.
But it is insisted that the tax proceedings in question were
void for want of jurisdiction in the taxing officers. These
proceedings were carried on by the officers of the town of
Superior, and appellant proved that in 1859 the town of
Pokegama was organized by the county board and included
township No. 49, range 14 W., in which the land in controversy was situated, and that the town of Pokegama was duly
organized and represented upon the county board in 1859 and
1860. But it appeared that in 1859 two towns were set off
by the board of county supervisors, one, township 48, range 14,
to be known as Nemadji, and the other, township 49, range

BARDON v. LAND & RIVER IMPROVEMENT 00.

335

Opinion of the Court.

14, to be known as Pokegama, and that on January 19, 1861,
a resolution was passed by the county board as follows:
"That the towns of Pokegama and Nemadji be vacated, the
above order to take effect and be in force on and after the
first day of April next, and the board do further order and
determine that the next town meeting shall be held in the
town of Superior to elect three supervisors that shall be the
county and town board of supervisors."
While not accurately worded in that respect, the obvious
intention was that the territory of these two towns should
become part of the town of Superior, and the record of town
and board meetings thereafter down to a point of time
subsequent to these tax proceedings establish the continued
exercise of jurisdiction over the whole territory.
By section 28 of chapter 13 of the Revised Statutes of 1858
power was conferred upon county boards "to set off, organize,
vacate, and change the boundaries of towns in their respective
counties." And to their action, as embodied in this resolution,
it will not do, as is well said in Hark v. Gladwell,49 Wisconsin,
172, 177, to apply "nice verbal criticism and strict parliamentary distinctions, because the business is transacted generally by
plain men, not familiar with parliamentary law. Therefore
their proceedings must be liberally construed in order to get
at the real intent and meaning of the body."
By chapter 54 of the General Laws of Wisconsin of 1883
(vol. 1, p. 49,) it was provided, among other things, that "every
town shall be considered and held to be, and to have been duly
organized, which has exercised, or shall hereafter exercise, the
powers, functions, and franchises of a town for a period of two
years." The statute further enacted that the validity of any
order or ordinance purporting to organize or set off any new
town, or to change the boundaries of any existing town or
towns, might be tested by certiorarior any other proper proceeding brought directly for the purpose of vacating such order
or ordinance in a court of competent jurisdiction, at any time
within two years after the date of such order or ordinance,
or within sixty days after the publication of the act if two
years had already expired, and that no such order or ordi-

nance should be otherwise questioned than directly. This
recognized the general rule of the common law on the subject of collateral attack, and we are of opinion that the corporate standing of the town of Superior as including the other
two towns cannot be thus questioned after the years of corporate action shown by the evidence. Austrian v. Guy, 21
Fed. Rep. 500.
Dismissing the numerous other objections discussed, such as
the admission of the deeds in evidence without proof of execution; the alleged payment of the taxes for 1866; the custody
of the tax records; the official character of the deputy county
clerk; the validity of his appointment, etc., as either not properly raised or arising, on the record, or as not sufficiently well
founded to call for observations upon them, although they have
all been carefully examined, we are brought to the point which
the Circuit Court regarded as the principal question in the
case, namely, the objection made to the elder tax deed that
the record thereof was void, because not properly indexed as
the statute required.
By sections 140, 142, and 143 of chapter 13 of the Revised
Statutes of 1858 it was provided that the register of deeds
should have the custody of all books, records, deeds, etc.,
deposited or kept in his office; should record or cause to be
recorded correctly and in a plain and distinct handwriting in
suitable books, all deeds, mortgages, maps, instruments, and
writings authorized by law to be recorded in his office; that
he should keep a general index, each page of which should be
divided into eight columns, with heads to the respective columns, as follows: "Time of reception. Name of grantor.
Name of grantee. Description of land. Name of instrument.
Volume and page where recorded. To whom delivered. Fees
received;" that such register should make correct entries in
said index of every instrument or writing received by him for
record, under the respective and appropriate heads, entering
the names of the grantors in alphabetical order; and should
immediately, upon the receipt of any such instrument or writing for record, enter in the appropriate column and in the order
in which it was received the day, hour, and minute of its recep-

337

Opinion of the Court.

tion, and the safne should be considered as recorded at the time
so noted. By section 759 of the Revised Statutes of 1878 it is
directed that the division shall be into nine columns, the first
column being headed: "Number of instrument," and the
others as in the act of 1858.
In Lombard v. Culbertson, 59 Wisconsin, 433, 439, it was
said that the entries in the general index are the material
things in determining whether a deed has been so recorded as
to be notice to subsequent purchasers, prior decisions to the
same effect being cited, and as to a claimant under a tax deed
it was held that "he is clearly required to show that it was so
recorded as to be constructive notice, at least, to the plaintiff,
that he held such tax title and intended to rely upon such
deed to defeat plaintiff's title. He must record it the same
way to set the statute of limitations running in his favor and
against the plaintiff as he would be required to do in the case
of a deed or mortgage to defeat the right of a subsequent
purchaser for value without notice." The decisions are numerous, and many are cited by counsel upon the question
whether in recording tax deeds the general index and the
record at large can be relied on to help out defects existing in
either.
In this case the tax deed was entered in the index under
the name of Douglas County by which it was issued, although
running in the name of the State as well as of the county.
And it is contended that, as a tax deed containing the name
of the county as grantor, but omitting the name of the State
as grantor, is void upon its face, -Easley v. JVkipvle, 57 Wisconsin, 485; Haseltine v. -lewitt,61 Wisconsin, 121, and that
if the index showed a deed void on its face, though it was not
so in fact, the falsity of the index would not be cured by the
actual and correct spreading of the deed upon the record,
therefore this deed should be held void. But it was distinctly
ruled in Hall v. Baker, 74 Wisconsin, 118, 131, that all that is
required by the provision regarding the general index is to
give the name of the county only, and not the State, as
grantor, and Chief Justice Cole said: "A person searching
the record for a tax deed would naturally look for the name
VOL. cLVfl-22

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

of the county which gave it, and would not be likely to look
for the name of the State as grantor. It would be laborious
to find the proper deed under the name of the State, considering the many counties in the State."
It appeared that none of the tax deeds of record in the
register's office of Douglas County, Wisconsin, had been
indexed under the name of the State of Wisconsin, either
under the letter S or under the letter W, in the index, and
that the respective registers of deeds had been and were
accustomed to enter such deeds under the letter D with the
name of Douglas County as grantor.
We entirely concur in the ruling of the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin, and it is decisive of the question made.
We do not understand from the arguments of counsel that
it was contended in the court below, or is contended here,
that the date of filing, "18 7 0 , September t, 3 r. r.," the name
of the grantor, "Douglas County, per clerk," and of the
grantee, "Hlayes, Ilirain," did not appear upon the original
index, although in his brief in reply counsel for appellant
criticises the language of the District Judge in disposing of
the case as if he had therein proceeded upon the ground that
a part of the index was the whole of it. We assume that the
original index had the eight divisions of the statute, but that
the fourth column, under the heading "description," was subdivided, and that all after the first three statutory divisions
ran as exhibited in the photographic copy introduced below
and presented at the bar, and reproduced on page 339.
The objection appears to be that in the colmn for the
description the figures 28, 49, 14 were not under the sub-head-

ings of the fourth division, but so crowded toward the right
as to be so incorrect and misleading as to invalidate the index
in respect of that entry. We do not think so. We agree
with the Circuit Court that taking the page as a whole any
one who would be misled by it would be misled wilfully, and
that the index furnished all the information that an ordinarily
prudent man would want to send him to the full record of the
deed. The entry would be read at once as the southwest
quarter or half of section 28, township 49, north of range 14

west, recorded in volume one of tax deeds on pages 378 and
379, and delivered to H. Hayes, who paid the charge of $1.
The designation of the range should have been west instead
of east, but the owner or any person desirous of obtaining
information about the land would know that range 14 west
was in Douglas County and that range 14 east was not. At
all events, he could refer at once, if he had any doubt, to
volume one of tax deeds, pages 378 and 379.
It was said in Oconto Company v. Je,rard, 46 Wisconsin,
317, 322: "The statutory direction is substantially complied
with by a certain reference to another book in the same office.
No sane man searching the general index for instruments
affecting any land would disregard such a reference, and it
would be a severe technicality to avoid the registration of a
deed for such a failure in the duty of the register, with such
present and easy means given on the face of the index of
obtaining the information which the index itself should have
given. The cruelty of such a technicality would be apparent
in any instrument except a tax deed. And, as already seen,
what can impair registry of a tax deed impairs the registry
of any deed."
Even if a more rigid rule were applied, we should say that,
in any view, the index was sufficient to set the statute of
limitations in operation.
But it further appeared that under chapter 201 of the laws
of 1860, (Laws 1860, 178,) providing that when public records
should become dilapidated it should be the duty of the board
of supervisors to cause the same to be transcribed and certified, the original index in the register's office was transcribed
under certain resolutions of the board of supervisors of Douglas
County of 1"k[y 28, 1872, and July 2, 1873, and that the record
was completed November 9, 1875. It is admitted that the
index as thus reproduced is not open to the objections raised.
etlierlby, 60 N. W. Rep. 423, it was held that
In Ifotson v.
"it is well settled that an omission to make proper entries in

record may be removed after such recording by making the

that date, and it will not be necessary to record the deed
again at length." And in that case, and in lombard v. Culbertson, 59 Wisconsin, 433, the doctrine is laid down that the
register of deeds may correct a record of his own motion.
The law of 1860 directed the officer making the transcript
to "certify that he has carefully compared the matters therein
contained and written, and that the same is a correct and
literal copy of the book from which the same was transcribed,
naming such book," and enacted that "such copy record, so
certified, is hereby declared a public record, and as such shall,
in all respects, have the same effect as the book from which
the same was transcribed." The resolution of May 28, 1872,
provided that after the indices should be transcribed, "the old
volumes shall be carefully preserved as the records of the
county, and the new copy shall be for general use until the
legislature shall authorize the use of the copids as records."
The resolution of July 2, 1873, requested the register to complete the general index as authorized May 28, 1872, and to
examine and correct the index and copy in .time for legislation
by the next legislature.
By chapter 284 of the laws of 1875, approved -March5, 1875,
(Laws 1875, 541,) authorizing the county board of supervisors
to replace worn or dilapidated records, it was provided that
the officer "shall carefully compare the copy so made with
the original, and shall certify thereon that he has carefully compared said copy with such original, and that said copy is a
correct transcript from such original and of the whole thereof,
and that the same has been so transcribed by him pursuant to
the resolution of the board of supervisors of the said county,
specifying in the certificate the date of -the passage of such
resolution;" and that "the copy so made shall have the same
effect as the original, and be evidence in all cases where such
original would be evidence, and shall be in its legal effect in all
respects considered as an original record in such office."
The certificate to the copy in this instance, under date
INovember 9, 1875, was by the register, who certified to this
effect: "I have carefully compared this copy of 'grantor's
index' with the original in this office, and that said copy is a

correct transcript from such original and of the whole thereof,
being up to and including the 31st day of December, A.D.
1871, and that the same has been transcribed by me pursuant
to the resolution of the board of supervisors of said county
passed May 28th, 1872."
After the index was thus reproduced the original was kept
in the vault and the certified copy was in common use from
November 9, 1875. it would seem that the new volume was
from that date as effective as an original, and that the register
of deeds would have the same power to correct mistakes in the
latter as in the former. At all events, under the circumstances, appellant occupied no position to question the title of
complainant as a bonafidTe purchaser in 1883, on the ground of
informality in the original index.

WALTON v. MARIETTA CHAIR COMPANY.
ERROR

TO THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.

No. 234. Submitted March 4, 1895. -Decided

March 2,1695.

A writ of error, which names, as the plaintiff in error, a certain person as
administrator of a certain estate, may be amended by substituting the
name of another person who appears by the accompanying record to
have claimed to succeed him as such administrator, tendered the bill
of exceptions, and given bond to prosecute the writ of error.
A writ of error should state the Christian name of the plaintiff in error, and
not the initial letter thereof only.

Tins was a motion to amend a writ of error from this court
to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern
District of Ohio, by changing the name of the plaintiff in
error. The record of that court showed the following
matters:
The original action was brought in November, 1889, by
"W. N. Walton, administrator of the estate of Latimer Bailey,
deceased," a citizen of New Jersey, against the Marietta Chair
