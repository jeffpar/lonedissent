MEAGHEIR.

1. By the act of May 10, 1872, c. 152 (17 Stat. 91), and the acts amendatory
thereof, the rights of the original locator of a mining claim or of his assignoe, which was located prior to that date, were continued until Jan. 1,
1875, although no work had been done thereon, provided that no relocation
thereof had been made ; and they were thereafter extended, if within the
year 1875, and before another party relocated the claim, work was resumed
thereon to the extent required by law. When, therefore, work was so
resumed, the claim was not open to relocation before Jan. 1, 1877, although
no work had been done upon it during the year 1876.
2. Actual possession of the claim is not essential to the validity of the title
obtained by a valid location; and until such location is terminated by
abandonment or forfeiture, no right or claim to the property can be acquired by an adverse entry thereon with a view to the relocation thereof.
3. A. entered, Dec. 19, 1876, upon a claim not then in the actual possession of
any one, but covered by a valid and subsisting location which did not expire
until the first day of January thereafter. Between the date of his entry
and Feb. 21, 1877, he made no improvements or enclosure, and did a very
small amount of work, but had no other title than such as arose from his
attempted location of the claim and his occasional labor upon it. On the
last-mentioned date B. entered upon the property peaceably and in good
faith, and did all that was required to protect his right to the exclusive
possession thereof. A. brought ejectment, Oct. 25, 1877. hIeld, that A.'s
entry and labor did not entitle him to a patent under sect. 2332, Rev. Stat.,
nor prevent B.'s acquisition of title to. the claim, and that the Statute of
Limitations of Montana of Jan. 11, 1872, had no application thereto.
4. A matter occurring during the progress of the trial which was not brought to
the attention of the court below, nor decided by it, will not be considered
here.
5. Where specific objections are made to the admission of evidence, all others
are waived.
6. Where, under the supervision of the proper officer, the records of a county
were transcribed from a temporary book, wherein they had been originally
recorded, into another, which was thereafter recognized as a part of the
public records, and it was shown that the original book had been lost or
destroyed, held, that the other book was properly admitted in evidence.

[Sup. .

Mr. Samuel Shellabargerand Mr. -E. W. Toole for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. J. C. Robinson and Mr. Richard T. Merrick, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is an action of ejectment brought by Belk, the plaintiff
in error, to recover the possession of a certain alleged quartzlode mining claim, being, as is stated in the complaint, "a relocation of a part of what is known as the old original lode
claim." Passing by for the present the exceptions taken to
the rulings of the court at the trial on the admission and rejection of testimony, the facts affecting the title of the respective
parties may be stated as follows: In July or August, 1864, George 0. Humphreys and William Allison located the discovery claim on the original lode
and claims one and two west of discovery. These locations
were valid and subsisting on the 10th of May, 1872, and no
claim adverse to them then existed. No work was done on
them between that date and June, 1875. During the month
of June, 1875, and before any relocation had been made, the
original locators, or their grantees, resumed work upon the
claims, and did enough to re-establish their original rights, if
that could be done by a simple resumption of work at that time.
No work was afterwards done on the property by the original locators, or any one claiming under them; and it does not
appear that they were in the actual possession of the claims, or
any part thereof, on the 19th of December, 1876, or for a long
time before. It is conceded by both parties that the original
claims lapsed on the 1st of January, 1877, because of a failure
to perform the annual work required by the act of Congress
in such cases.
On the 19th of December, 1876, Belk made the relocation
under which he now claims, and did all that was necessary to
perfect his rights, if the premises were at that time open for
that purpose. His entry on the property was peaceable, no one
appearing to resist. Between the date of his entry and the
21st of February, 1877, he did a small amount of work on the
claim which did not occupy more than two days of his time,

Oct. 1881.]

BELK V. MEAGHER.

and probably not so much as that, and he had no other possession of the property than such as arose from his location of the
claim and his occasional labor upon it. On the 21st of February, 1877, the defendants entered on the property peaceably
and made another relocation, doing all that was required to
perfect their rights, if the premises were at the time open to
them. The possession they had when this suit was begun was
in connection with the title they acquired in that way.
Upon this state of facts the questions presented in argument
for our consideration are, 1. Whether the work done in June, 1875, was sufficient to
give the original locators, or those claiming under them, an exclusive right to the possession and enjoyment of the property
until Jan. 1, 1877.
2. Whether, if it was, a valid relocation of the premises, good
as against everybody but the original locators or their grantees,
could be made by Belk on the 19Lh of December, 1876, his
entry for that purpose being peaceable and without force.
3. Whether, if Belk's relocation was invalid when made, it
became effectual in law on the 1st of January, 1877, when the
original claims lapsed; and,
4. Whether, even if the relocation of Belk was invalid, the
defendants could, after the 1st of January, 1877, make a relocation which would give them as against him an exclusive right
to the possession and enjoyment of the property, their entry for
that purpose being made peaceably and without force.
By sect. 3 of the act of May 10, 1872, c. 152 (17 Stat. 91),
entitled "An Act to promote the development of the mining
resources of the United States," it was provided that the locators of all mining locations theretofore made, or which should
thereafter be made, on any mineral vein, lode, or ledge situated
on the public donmain, their heirs and assigns, where no adverse
claim then existed, should have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines
of their locations, so long as they complied with the laws of the
United States, and with State, territorial, and local regulations,
not in conflict with the laws of the United States, governing
their possessory title. The fifth section further provided that
on all claims located prior to the passage of the act, ten dollars'

BELK V. MEAGHER.

[Sup. Ct.

worth of work should be performed or improvements made each
year for each one hundred feet in length along the vein, until a
patent should have issued therefor; and upon a failure to comply with this condition, the claim or mine on which the failure
occurred should be open to relocation in the same manner as if
no location of the same had ever been made, provided the original locators, their heirs, assigns, or legal representatives had
not resumed work on the claim after the failure and before the
relocation. By the act of March 1, 1873, c. 214 (17 Stat.
483), the time for making the first annual expenditure, under
the act of 1872, was extended to June 10, 1874; and by the
act of June 6, 1874, c. 220 (18 Stat. 61), to Jan. 1, 1875.
The exact language of this last act is as follows: "That the
provisions of the fifth section of the act . . . passed May 10,
1872, which requires expenditures of labor and improvements
on claims located prior to the passage of said act, are hereby
so amended that the time for the first annual expenditure on
claims located prior to the passage of said act shall be extended
to the first day of January, 1875."
For all the purposes of this case the law stands as it would
have stood had the original act of 1872 provided that the first
annual expenditure on claims then in existence might be made
at any time before Jan. 1, 1875, and annually thereafter until
a patent issued. If it was not made by that time the claim
would be open to relocation, provided work was not resumed
upon it by the original locators or those claiming under them,
before a new location was made. Such being the law, it seems
to us clear that if work is renewed on a claim after it has once
been open to relocation, but before a relocation is actually
made, the rights of the original owners stand as they would if
there had been no failure to comply with this condition of the
act. The argument on the part of the plaintiff in error is that,
if no work is done before January, 1875, all rights under the
original claim are gone; but that is not, in our opinion, the
fair meaning of the language which Congress has employed to
express its will. As we think, the exclusive possessory rights
of the original locator and his assigns were continued, without
any work at all, until Jan. 1, 1875, and afterwards if, before
another entered on his possession and relocated the claim,

Oct. 1881.]

BELK V. MEAGHER.

he resumed work to the extent required by the law. His
rights after resumption were precisely what they would have
been if no default had occurred. The act of 1874 is in form
an amendment of that of 1872, and all the provisions of the
old law remain in full force, except so far as they are modified
by the new.
From what has thus been said, it is apparent that as work
was done in the present case during the year 1875, before any
relocation was made, the original claim was continued in force
and made operative until there could be another forfeiture by
reason of the failure of the owners to do the necessary annual
work. The year in which the work was done began on the 1st
of January, 1875, and ended on the 31st of December. The
law fixes no time within a year when the work must be done.
Consequently, if done at any time during the year, it is enough,
and there can be no forfeiture until the entire year has gone
by. That, in this case, would not be until Dec. 31, 1876 ; and
the work, if completed on that day, would be just as effectual
for the protection of the claim as if it had been done on the 1st
of January previous. It follows that on the 19th of December,
1876, the owners of the original location had, under the act of
Congress, the exclusive right to the possession and enjoyment
of the property in dispute.
A mining claim perfected under the law is property in the
highest sense of that term, which may be bought, sold, and
conveyed, and will pass by descent. Forbes v. Gracey, 94 U. S.
762. There is nothing in the act of Congress which makes
actual possession any more necessary for the protection of the
title acquired to such a claim by a valid location, than it is for
any other grant from the United States. The language of the
act is that the locators "shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the
lines of their locations," which is to continue until there shall
be a failure to do the requisite amount of work within the prescribed time. Congress has seen fit to make the possession of
that part of the public lands which is valuable for minerals
separable from the fee, and to provide for the existence of an
exclusive right to the possession, while the paramount title to
the land remains in the United States. In furtherance of this

BELK V. MEAGHER.

[Sup. Ct.

policy it was enacted by sect. 9 of the act of Feb. 27, 1865,
c. 64 (13 Stat. 441, Rev. Stat., sect. 910), that no possessory
action between individuals in the courts of the United States
for the recovery of mining titles should be affected by the fact
that the paramount title to the land was in the United States,
but that each case should be adjudged by the law of possession.
Mining claims are not open to relocation until the rights of
a former locator have come to an end. A relocator seeks to
avail himself of mineral in the public lands which another has
discovered. This lie cannot do until the discoverer has in law
abandoned his claim, and left the property open for another to
take up. The right of location upon the mineral lands of the
United States is a privilege granted by Congress, but it can
only be exercised within the limits prescribed by the grant.- A
location can only be made where the law allows it to be done.
Any attempt to go beyond that will be of no avail. Hence a
relocation on lands actually covered at the time by another
valid and subsisting location is void ; and this not only against
the prior locator, but all the world, because the law allows no
such thing to be done. It follows that the relocation of Belk
was invalid at the tim it was made, and continued to be so
until Jan. 1, 1877.
The next inquiry is, whether the attempted location in
December became operative on the 1st of January, so as to
give Belk the exclusive right to the possession and enjoyment
of the claim after that. We think it did not. The right to
the possession comes only from a valid location. Consequently,
if there is no location there can be no possession under it.
Location does not necessarily follow from possession, but
possession from location. A location is not made by taking
possession alone, but by working on the ground, recording and
doing whatever else is required for that purpose by the acts of
Congress and the local laws and regulations. As in this case,
all these things were done when the law did not allow it; they
are as if they had never been done. On the 19th of December
the right to the possession of this property was just as much
withdrawn from the public domain as the fee is by a valid grant
from the United States under the authority of law, or the

Oct. 1881.]

BELK V. MEAGHER.

possession by a valid and subsisting homestead or pre-emption
entry. As the United States could not at the time give Belk
the right to take possession of the property for the purpose of
making his location, because there was an existing outstanding grant of the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment,
it would seem necessarily to follow that any tortious entry he
might make must be unavailing for the purposes of a valid
location of a claim under the act of Congress. A location to
be effectual must be good at the time it is made. When perfected it has the effect of a grant by the United States of the
right of present and exclusive possession. As the proceeding
to locate is one in which the United States is not directly an
actor, but is carried on by the locator alone, so that he may
act of Congress,
take what the United States has, through an
offered to give, it is clear that there can be nothing to take
until there is an offer to give. Here Congress has said in unmistakable language that what has been once located under
the law shall not be relocated until the first location has expired, and it is difficult to see why, if Belk could make his
relocation on the 19th of December, lie might not on the 19th
of January before. Lansdale v. Daniels, 100 U. S. 113, 116.
The original locators and their grantees had precisely the same
rights after each date, the only difference being in duration.
To hold that, before the former location has expired, an entry
may be made and the several acts done necessary to perfect a
relocation, will be to encourage unseemly contests about the
possession of the public mineral-bearing lands which would
almost necessarily be followed by breaches of the peace.
This brings us to the inquiry whether the possession of
Belk, after the 1st of January, was such as to prevent the
defendants from making a valid relocation and acquiring title
under it. The position taken in his behalf is, that even if the
original locators, or their grantees, had, under the act of Congress, a right to the possession of their claim until January 1,
a statute of limitations in Montana would bar their action
against him for its recovery, because they had not been in
actual possession within a year previous to his entry, and coiisequently his entry, though tortious as to them, was good as
the beginning of an adverse possession, which, if continued for

BELK V. MEAGHER.

[Sup. Ct.

a year, would entitle him to a patent under the provisions of
sect. 2332 of the Revised Statutes. The statute of Montana
relied on is as follows: "No action to recover any mining
claim, whether placer or quartz, or any quartz lead or lode, or
any interests therein or possession thereof, unless the same be
held under patent from the government of the United States,
shall be commenced or maintained unless that it is proved that
the plaintiff, or his assigns, or predecessor in interest, were in
the actual seisin or possession of such mining claim, quartz lead
or lode, within one year next before the commencement of such
action." Laws of Montana, 1872, p. 591.
And sect. 2332 of the Revised Statutes is as follows:
" Where such person or association, they and their grantors,
have held and worked their claims for a period equal to the
time prescribed by the Statute of Limitations for mining
claims of the State or Territory where the same may be situated, evidence of such possession and working of the claims
for such period shall be sufficient to establish a right to a
patent thereto under this chapter in the absence of an adverse
claim."
The Montana statute was passed Jan. 11, 1872, and the act
of Congress, under which both parties claim, on the 10th of
May thereafter. Under the act of Congress, as has just been
seen, the original locators, or their grantees, had what was
equivalent to a grant by the United States of the right to the
exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property until January 1. The Montana statute, if in any respect repugnant to this,
was repealed to the extent of such repugnancy by the act of
Congress. As between possessors, having no other title than
such as is derived from mere occupancy, an action would undoubtedly be barred by the Montana statute. Whether that
would be so in a case where an actual right of possession had
been acquired under the act of Congress is a question we need
not consider, as here the controversy is not between Belk
and the prior locators. It is clear that, whether in Montana
an action could be maintained against him or not, his right of
location depended entirely on the act of Congress, and under
it, as has already been seen, what he did had no effect to secure
to him the grant of any rights. All he got or could get by his

Oct. 1881.]

BELK V. MEAGHER.

entry was possession, and that, to be of any avail, must be
actual.
Under the provisions of the Revised Statutes relied on, Belk
could not get a patent for the claim he attempted to locate,
unless he secured what is here made the equivalent of a valid
location by actually holding and working for the requisite time.
If he actually held possession and worked the claim long
enough, and kept all others out, his right to a patent would be
complete. He had no grant of any right of possession. His
ultimate right to a patent depended entirely on his keeping
himself in and all others out, and if lie was not actually in, lie
was in law out. A peaceable adverse entry, coupled with the
right to hold the possession which was thereby acquired, operated as an ouster, which broke the continuity of his holding
and deprived him of the title he might have got if he had kept
in for the requisite length of time. He had made no such
location as prevented the lands from being in law vacant.
Others had the right to enter for the purpose of taking them
up, if it could be done peaceably and without force. There
is nothing in Atherton v. Fowler (96 U. S. 513) to the contrary of this. In that case it was held a right of pre-emption
could not be established by a forcible intrusion upon the possession of one who had already settled upon, improved, and
enclosed the property. Upon that proposition the court was
unanimous. We also all agree that if a peaceable entry had
been made on lands which had not been enclosed or improved,
a good right might have been secured. The only difference
of opinion we had was as to whether the entry in that case was
by force or peaceably. A majority of the court thought it
was forcible, while the minority considered that the case had
been fairly put to the jury on the question of forcible or
peaceable entry, and the effect of the verdict was that it had
been peaceable.
This brings us to the facts of the present case. No one contends that the defendants effected their entry and secured their
relocation by force. They knew what Belk had done and what
he was doing. He had no right to the possession, and was
only on the land at intervals. There was no enclosure, and
he had made no improvements. He apparently exercised no

BELK V. MEAGHER.

[Sup. Ct.

other acts of ownership, after January 1, than every explorer
of the mineral lands of the United States does when he goes
on them and uses his pick to search for and examine lodes and
veins. As his attempted relocation was invalid, his rights were
no more than those of a simple explorer. In two months he
had done, as he himself says, "no bard work on the claim,"
and he " probably put two days' work on the ground."' This
was the extent of his possession. He was not an original discoverer, but he sought to avail himself of what others had
found. Relying on what he had done in December, he did not
do what was necessary to effect a valid relocation after January 1. His possession might have been such as would have
enabled him to bring an action of trespass against one who
entered without any color of right, but it was not enough, as
we think, to prevent an entry peaceably and in good faith for
the purpose of securing a right under the act of Congress to
the exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property. The
defendants having got into possession and perfected a relocation,
have secured the better right. When this suit was begun they
had not only possession, but a right granted by the United
States to continue their possession against all adverse claimants. The possession by Belk was that of a mere intruder,
while that of the defendants was accompanied by color of
title.
It is contended, however, that the court erred in its charge
to the jury, because it assumed that the defendants' relocation
was good if that of Belk was bad. The notice of the relocation
of the defendants was proved by the introduction of the county
records, and if we understand correctly the position which is
now taken, it is that this notice was defective because of an
insufficient affidavit. We cannot find that this precise objection was taken below. When the record was first offered in
evidence it seems to have been objected to generally, but afterwards, on a motion to strike it out, the reasons assigned were:
1, that the original was not shown to have been out of the
possession or under the control of the defendants; and, 2, that
the record did not give a sufficient description of the location.
As the affidavit to the notice of the relocation of Belk was
identical in form with that of the defendants, it is possible such

Oct. 1881.]

BELK V. MEAGHER.

an objection as is now made was not then desirable; but however that may be, we are clearly of the opinion it cannot be
made for the first time in this court. The trial below was conducted entirely on the theory that Belk had the better right,
because the defendants could not in law make a relocation at
the time they did. The court had the right to understand that
it was conceded the defendants had perfected their title if it
could be done under the circumstances, and the special objections made to the evidence that was introduced should not be
sustained. Nothing which occurred in the progress of the trial
below can be assigned for error here which was not brought to
the attention of the court and decided by it. When specific
objections are made to the admission of evidence, the court has
the right to assume that all others are waived, and proceed with
the case accordingly. Consequently, when the specific objections made to the introduction of this notice in evidence were
overruled, the court had the right to consider it was no longer
contended that the requisite notice had not been given and
recorded.
This disposes of all the questions raised on the instructions
to the jury. It remains to consider the various exceptions
taken to the admission and rejection of testimony. These
are: -

1. As to the admission of the book from the office of the
recorder of Deer Lodge County to prove the record of the location of the original lode claims by Humphrey and Allison.
2. As to the admission of the books of record from the same
office to prove certain deeds by which it was claimed the title
of Humphrey and Allison to the original lode claims was transmitted, in whole or in part, to one Murphy; and,
3. The rejection of the testimony of one McFarland, a witness produced at the trial.
1. As to the proof of the record of the location of the original
lode claim.
As Belk sets up title only as a relocator of part of the
original lode claim, lie impliedly admits the validity of the
prior location. There can be no relocation unless there has
been a prior valid location, or something equivalent, of the same
property. It is nowhere disputed that Humphrey and Allison

BELK V. MEAGHER.

[Sup. Ct.

were the locators and owners of the claim originally. The proof
by the record was, therefore, probably unnecessary; but if not,
it seems to us the book offered was sufficiently authenticated.
It was one of the books of record kept in the proper office, and
transmitted as such from one officer to another. The original
recording appears to have been in a temporary book, and, at a
very early date in the history of the county, transcribed by
the deputy recorder, under the general supervision of his principal, into the book which has since been recognized as part of
the public records of the office. It was sufficiently shown that
the original book had been lost or destroyed. This we think
enough to justify the use of the present book in its place.
Having been recognized as part of the official records of the
county almost from the time of the organization of civil government in the Territory, it would be dangerous to exclude it
now without any proof of fraud or mistake.
2. As to the deeds. In the view we take of the case, it is
entirely unimportant whether the original lode claim had been
transferred or not. The work was done in 1875 by Humphrey,
one of the original locators, for the express purpose of resuning
the claim. He says it was done under an arrangement which
he made to that effect with Thornton, who, according to the
deeds put in evidence, was the owner of three-fourths of the
property, Humphrey himself owning the rest. It is a matter
of no importance to Belk whether the work that was done
inured to the benefit of Humphrey alone or to him with others.
Without, therefore, considering any of the questions presented
in the argument as to the competency of the evidence, or the
proper execution of the deeds, we are clearly of the opinion
that there is nothing in the assignments of error affecting
this branch of the case which requires a reversal of the judgment.
3. As to the testimony of McFarland. He was in effect
asked whether any one had that day pointed out to him the
line between the National Mining and Exploring Company's
ground and the defendants'; and, if so, whom; and if he knew
where the line was. There was but one question, and the objection was made to the question. It was entirely immaterial,
so far as anything appears in the record, whether any one pointed

Oct. 1881.]

GILES v. LITTLE.

out the line to the witness or not, unless it was some one connected with the suit of the parties. It is true, if he knew of
his own knowledge where the line was, he might tell, but in
the form the question was put he could well think he would be
permitted to tell where it was as it had been pointed out to
him. The question was clearly too general, and on that account
objectionable. It is quite possible the witness knew facts that
were material to the issue which was being tried. If he did,
and the plaintiff desired to have them, the question should
have been made more specific, and the objections to the form
of that which was put removed.
Upon a careful consideration of the whole case we find no
error.
Judgment affirmed.
