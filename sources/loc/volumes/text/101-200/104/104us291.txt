out the line to the witness or not, unless it was some one connected with the suit of the parties. It is true, if he knew of
his own knowledge where the line was, he might tell, but in
the form the question was put he could well think he would be
permitted to tell where it was as it had been pointed out to
him. The question was clearly too general, and on that account
objectionable. It is quite possible the witness knew facts that
were material to the issue which was being tried. If he did,
and the plaintiff desired to have them, the question should
have been made more specific, and the objections to the form
of that which was put removed.
Upon a careful consideration of the whole case we find no
error.
Judgment affirmed.

GILES v. LITTLE.

A.'s last will and testament provides as follows: "To my beloved wife E. I
give and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, of which I may die seised,
the same to remain and be hers, with full power, right, and authority to dispose of the same as to her shall seem meet and proper, so long as she shall
remain my widow, upon the express condition that if she shall marry again,
then it is my will that all of the estate herein bequeathed, or whatever may
remain, should go to my surviving children, share and share alike." A.'s
children and E. survived him. She conveyed the real estate to B. in fee,
and subsequently married. Held, that B.'s estate determined on E.'s marriage.

to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Dis-

trict of Nebraska.
This was an action for the recovery of lot No. 6, in block 54,
in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska.
The following are the material averments of the petition: " On June 10, 1.869, and thence up to his death, Jacob Dawson was seised and possessed of divers real and personal estates
of great value, and had a wife named Edith J., and six children who were on said day minors, and some very young, and
all without any property whatever, his wife being seised and
possessed in her own right of real and personal estates of the
value of ten thousand dollars and over.

GILES v. LITTLE.

[Sup. Ct.

"On said day the said Jacob made his last will and testament, which contained the following sole bequest: After all
my lawful debts are paid and discharged, the residue of my
estate, real and personal, I give, bequeath, and dispose of as
follows, to wit: To my beloved wife Edith J. Dawson I give
and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, of which I may
die seised, the same to remain and be hers, with full power,
right, and authority to dispose of the same, as to her shall seem
meet and proper, so long as she shall remain my widow; upon
the express condition, that, if she shall marry again, then it is
my will that all of the estate herein bequeathed, or whatever
may remain, should go to my surviving children, share and
share alike; and in case any of my children should have deceased, leaving issue, then the issue so left to receive the share
to which said child would be entitled. I likewise make, constitute, and appoint my said wife Edith J. to be executrix of
this my last will and testament.
" On the twenty-second day of June, 1869, the said Jacob
died at Lancaster County in this district, leaving him surviving
his said wife and six children. The said will was duly proved
and admitted to probate in the proper court of said county, and
letters testamentary thereon were issued out of said court to
the said Edith J., who took upon her the execution of said
trust.
" The personal property, whereof the said Jacob died possessed, was duly inventoried and appraised at $958 ; and among
the real estates whereof, at his death, the said Jacob was seised,
was that certain piece or parcel of land known and described
as follows: Lot number 6, in block 54, in the city of Lincoln,
in said Lancaster County, except six inches off the entire east
line of said lot, which supports the east party-wall of said lot;
which lot is of the value of $5,000 and over.
" On the twenty-seventh day of April, 1870, the said Edith
J., by her certain deed of conveyance, dated on said day, and
duly executed and acknowledged, conveyed the said premises
to one Cody, by warranty deed, which contained no reference
to nor recited the power in said will, and by divers mesne
conveyances from said Cody, the said defendant Little claims
and pretends that he is seised in fee of said premises; and

he is now in possession thereof by the defendant May, as his
tenant.
" On or about the fifteenth day of November, 1879, the said
Edith J. intermarried with one Pickering.
" One of the said children of the said Jacob died intestate
without issue, and the survivors being in indigent circumstances have joined in a conveyance of the said premises, bearing date Sept. 15, 1869, and duly executed and acknowledged,
whereby they conveyed the same in fee to one Burr and one
Wheeler, who by their deed have duly conveyed the same to
the plaintiff. And by reason of the premises the said plaintiff has become and is seised in fee of said premises above
described, and isentitled to the immediate possession thereof;
the defendant Little, under the alleged title derived to him as
aforesaid, unlawfully keeps the said plaintiff out of possession
thereof."
There was a general demurrer to this petition, which the
Circuit Court sustained, and gave judgment for the defendants.
This action of the court is assigned for error.
Mr. James 1. Woolworth for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. T. M. Marquett, contra.
MR. JUSTICE WOODS, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The contention of the plaintiff in error is, that Edith J.
Dawson took, under the will of her deceased husband, Jacob
Dawson, an estate for life, subject to be determined in case she
contracted another marriage, with remainder to the heirs of
Jacob Dawson; and that the power of disposal conferred on
her by the will was only coextensive with the estate which she
took under the will, - that is to say, the power was granted her
to dispose of her life-estate, and, consequently, that the estate
conveyed by her deed to Cody determined upon her marriage
with Pickering.
It was said by this court in Clarke v. Boorman's -Executors
(18 Wall. 493), Mr. Justice Miller delivering its opinion, that
"of all legal instruments wills are the most inartificial, the
least to be governed in their construction by the settled use of

GILES v. LITTLE.

[Sup. Ct.

legal technical terms, the will itself being often the production
of persons not only ignorant of law, but of the correct use of
the language in which it is written. Under the state of the
science of law as applicable to the construction of wills, it may
well be doubted if any other source of enlightenment in the
construction of a will is of as much assistance as the application of natural reason to the language of the instrument, under
the light which may be thrown upon the intent of the testator
by the extrinsic circumstances surrounding its execution, and
connecting the parties and the property devised with the testator and with the instrument itself."
If we apply the methods thus indicated to the construction of the will of Jacob Dawson, there can, it seems to us, be
no serious doubt about its meaning.
According to the averments of the petition, it appears that
twelve days before his death Dawson executed his last will.
At that time he was the owner of some real estate, and of personal property of the value of $958. He was the father of six
living children, all of whom were minors, some of them very
young, and all without any property in their own right. His
wife, Edith J. Dawson, was the owner of real and personal
property to the amount of $10,000 or more.
The promptings of natural affection would lead a testator so
situated to provide in his will not only for his wife, but also for
his infant children.
The disposition of his property is made by a single sentence
in his will. It seems clear that his purpose was to give to his
wife an estate for life in his property, subject to be divested on
her contracting a second marriage, and on the determination of
her interest, either by her death or marriage, then an estate in
fee to his children. No man unversed in technical rules of
construction can, it seems to us, read this will without coming
to this conclusion. To hold otherwise would be to suppose the
testator, in drafting his will, was governed by abstruse rules of
law in regard to the effect of his expressions, of which, it is
probable, he never heard, and had not the slightest conception.
The clause of the will which disposes of the testator's entire
estate provides first for the payment of his lawful debts. The
residue of his estate (after payment of debts) is then disposed

GILES v. LITTLE.

of as follows: " To my beloved wife Edith J. Dawson I give
and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, of which I may
die seised, the same to remain and be hers, with full power,
right, and authority to dispose of the same as to her shall seem
meet and proper so long as she shall remain my widow." This
part of the disposing clause of the will is not open to doubt.
The phrase, "so long as she shall remain my widow," refers
to and qualifies the estate granted, as well as the power of
disposition. The clear and undoubted meaning of the sentence is, that as long as the devisee remains the widow of the
testator, his property, real and personal, shall remain and be
hers, with full power to dispose of the same. This construction, so far as it concerns the estate granted, is so obvious
that no discussion can make it any plainer. How large an
estate the widow was empowered to dispose of will be considered hereafter..
But the testator, not satisfied with this unequivocal declaration of his purpose, and to leave no doubt of his intention, and to
give direction to his property when the estate of his wife therein should determine, proceeds to add: " Upon the express condition that if she shall marry again, then it is my will that all of
the estate herein bequeathed, or whatever may remain, should
[shall] go to my surviving children, share and share alike."
It would be hard to express more clearly the purpose of the
testator to devise to his wife an estate during her widowhood,
and on its determination a remainder in fee to his children.
The contention, however, of the defendants in error is, that
the testator by this will gave to his wife an absolute estate in
fee-simple, with power, so long as she remained his widow, to
dispose of it absolutely.
We find no warrant for this construction of the will, either
in its terms or in the circumstances which surrounded the testator. The language is plain that the devisee was to take a
life-estate, subject to be determined on her second marriage,
with a limitation over to the children of the testator. His
purpose was clearly expressed, to provide for his children as
well as his widow, to give the latter all his estate as long as she
remained his widow, but to put it out of her power to disinherit his children. According to the construction of the

GILES V. LITTLE.

[Sup. Ct.

defendants in error, the will gave her the power of absolute
disposition during her widowhood, so that she could by her
conveyance entirely divert the estate from his children; and,
having done this, could contract a second marriage without the
loss of any interest in the proceeds of the property devised to
her by the testator.
We think it was not the purpose of the testator to devise an
estate in fee to his wife. As already remarked, the devise is
limited by the words "so long as she shall remain my widow."
But even if these words were wanting, the limitation over to
his children in case she should marry again would control and
restrict the preceding words by which the estate was granted.
Smith v. Bell (6 Pet. 68) is in point. The will construed
in that case declares: " I give to my wife Elizabeth Goodwin
all my personal estate, whatsoever and wheresoever, and of
what nature, kind, and quality soever, after payment of my
debts, legacies, and funeral expenses, which personal estate I
give and bequeath unto my said wife, Elizabeth Goodwin, to
and for her own use and benefit and disposal absolutely, the
remainder of said' estate, after her decease, to be for the use
of said Jesse Goodwin," son of the testator; "and I do hereby
constitute and appoint my said wife, Elizabeth Goodwin, sole
executrix of this my last will and testament."
The court held that this was a devise to the testator's wife for
life, with remainder to Jesse Goodwin. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering its opinion, said: "It must be admitted that
words could not have been employed which would be better
fitted to give the whole personal estate absolutely to the wife,
or which would more clearly express that intention. But the
testator proceeds: ' The remainder of said estate to be for the
use of the said Jesse Goodwin.' These words give the remainder
of the estate, after his wife's decease, to the son, with as much
clearness as the preceding words give the whole estate to his
wife. They manifest the intention of the testator to make a
future provision for his son as clearly as the first part of the
bequest manifests his intention to make an immediate provision
for his wife. . . . The limitation in remainder shows that, in
the opinion of the testator, the previous words had given only
an estate for life. This was the sense in which he used them."

Oct. 1881.]

GILES v. LITTLE.

This case establishes conclusively the contention of plaintiff
in error, that the words of the will under consideration, granting an estate to the wife, grant only an estate for life, and not
an estate in fee-simple.
But it is contended by defendants in error that there are
words in the last clause of the will which imply an absolute
power of disposition, and give to the children only what may
remain undisposed of in the wife's hands at the termination of
her estate. The clause is, " If she should marry again, then it
is my will that all the estates herein bequeathed, or whatever
may remain, shall go to my surviving children, share and share
alike." The contention rests upon the words, "or whatever
may remain," and is, that they imply that a part or all of the
estate might be absolutely disposed of by the wife during her
widowhood.
If the purpose of the testator in the disposition of his
property is what the other parts of his will clearly indicate,
then these words cannot be construed to change that purpose.
They can have operation without giving them that effect.
He was seised of real estate and possessed of personal property. Both were included in the devise to the wife, and she
was to have the enjoyment of both during her widowhood.
The use of many species of personal property necessarily consumes it. The words under consideration may, therefore, fairly
be construed to refer to the personalty, and the entire clause
to give to his children a remainder in the real estate, and whatever of the personalty was not consumed by the widow during
her widowhood.
This construction is warranted by the language of this court
in Smith v. Bell (supra), which was as follows: " This suit is
brought for slaves, a species of property not consumed by the
use and in which a remainder may be limited after a life-estate.
They composed a part, and probably the most important part,
of the personal estate given to the wife, 'to and for her own
use and benefit and disposal absolutely.' But in this personal
estate, according to the usual condition of persons in the situation of the testator, there were trifling and perishable articles,
such as stock on a farm, household furniture, the crop of the
year, which would be consumed in the use, and over which the

GILES V. LITTLE.

[Sup. Ct.

exercise of absolute ownership was necessary to a full enjoyment. These may have been in the mind of the testator when
he employed the strong words of the bequest to her."
This passage shows that, in order to carry out the evident
purpose of the testator, general words which are applicable to
property of different kinds may be restricted to property of a
particular kind. For instance, that the phrase "or whatever
may remain," in the will under consideration, may be limited
to personal property only, though used in a sentence which
applies to both real and personal estate.
On this subject Green v. Hewett, decided by the Supreme
Court of Illinois (12 Cent. Law Jour. 58), is precisely in point.
The will in that case provided as follows: "Second. After
payment of such debts and funeral expenses, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife the farm on which we now reside;
also all my personal property of every description, so long as
she remains my widow, at the expiration of that time the
whole, or whatsoever remains, to descend to my daughter,
M. T."
The court held that under this devise the widow did not
take a fee, and said: " The use of that expression [whatsoever
remains] is of no vital significance, and cannot be permitted to
override the clearly expressed intention that the widow should
take a life-estate only."
The next position of the defendants in error is, that even
conceding that the will gives the widow of testator an estate
for life, yet it conferred on her during her widowhood the
power to convey the entire estate in fee, and she having so
conveyed, the defendants in error who claim under her have a
good title.
But the authorities are adverse, and show that when a power
of disposal accompanies a bequest or devise of a life-estate, the
power is limited to such disposition as a tenant for life can
make, unless there are other words clearly indicating that a
larger power is intended.
Thus, in Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co. (93 U. S.326),
the words of the will were: "I give and bequeath to my
beloved wife Nancy Sinclair all my estate, both real and personal; that is to say, all my lands, cattle, horses, sheep, farming

Oct. 1881.]

GILES V. LITTLE.

utensils, household and kitchen furniture, with everything that
I possess, to have and to hold during her life, and to do with
as she sees proper before her death."
By virtue of this power the widow undertook to convey the
fee of the land. But this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field,
said: "The interest conveyed by the devise to the widow was
only a life-estate. The language admits of no other conclusion;
and the accompanying words, 'to do with as she sees proper
before her death,' only conferred power to deal with the property in such manner as she might choose, consistently with
that estate, and, perhaps, without liability for waste committed.
The words used in connection with a conveyance of a leasehold estate would never be understood as conferring a power
to sell the property so as to pass a greater estate. Whatever
power of disposal the words confer is limited by the estate
with which they are connected." See also Bradley v. Wescott, 13 Ves. Jr. 445; Simith v. Bell, supra; Boyd v. Strahan,
36 Ill. 355.
It is next insisted by the defendants in error that the statute
of Nebraska, according to which the will must be construed,
favors the construction contended for by them. The statute
declares, "every devise of land, in any will hereafter made,
shall be construed to convey all the estate of the devisor
therein which he could lawfully devise, unless it shall appear
by the will that the devisor intended to convey a less estate."
General Statutes of Nebraska, sect. 124, c. 17. We are at a
loss to see how the statute supports the view of one party to
this suit more than the other. According to the construction
of the plaintiff in error, the devise vested in the widow of the
devisor a life-estate, remainder in fee to his children; according to the construction of defendants in error, it vested the
fee in the widow. By either construction, the devise conveyed
all the estate of the devisor in the property devised. This is all
the statute demands.
Lastly, it is claimed by defendants in error that it is the settled rule that where a devisee, whose estate is undefined, is
directed to pay debts, the devisee takes an estate in fee.
The rule has no application here, for, as we have seen, the
estate of the devisee and executrix is clearly defined. A direc-

[Sup. Ct.

tion to pay debts cannot enlarge it. The case of Smith v. Bell
(supra) is precisely in point against the application of the rule
to this case.
We have no doubt about the true construction of this will.
Edith J. Dawson took under it an estate for life in the testator's lands, subject to be divested on her ceasing to be his
widow, with power to convey her qualified life-estate only. Her
estate in the land and that of her grantees determined on her
marriage with Pickering.
The judgment of the Circuit Court must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with directions
to proceed in the case in conformity with this opinion; and
