sible in evidence, according to the laws of Illinois, after proof
of the loss of the original.
In respect to the request which was made of the court to
charge the jury as to the effect of fraud in the procurement of
the deed, it is sufficient to say there is not a particle of evidence in the record to sustain such a claim. If the jury had

found for the plaintiff on any such theory, it would have been
the duty of the court to set the verdict aside and grant a new

trial. Consequently there was no error in refusing the charge
requested.
Judgment affirmed.

DAVIS v. FRIEDLANDER.
1. The assignment made to assignees in bankruptcy in proceedings which were
brought more than four months after attachments, issued in a chancery
suit pending in a State court, were levied upon the property of the bankrupt, does not divest the jurisdiction of that court to determine the priority
of lien respectively claimed by the attaching creditors, or to administer the
fund arising from the sale of the property.
2. His assignees in bankruptcy, if they enter their appearance in the suit, are
bound by the decree, affirming the validity of the liens acquired by the
levy of the writs, and directing the application of the proceeds of the sale
to satisfy them. The assignees cannot thereafter set up in any other court
their title to the property.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Western District of Tennessee.
Friedlander, Stich, & Co., sued Kaufman, their debtor, in the

law court of Memphis, taking out an attachment, which was
levied, Nov. 30, 1866, upon his real estate in that city. On different days in December, 1866, and January, 1867, Davis and
other creditors sued him in the chancery court, each taking out
an attachment, which was promptly levied on the same real

estate. On the 14th of July, 1868, he was adjudged a bankrupt
upon his petition, filed the 30th of the preceding May, - more
than a year after the levy of the last of the attachments.
Cirode and Coronna were appointed his assignees in bankruptcy, and to them was made an assignment of his rights,
property, and effects. On the 21st of November, 1868, they
appeared in the suits in the chancery court,- then consolidated
and about to be heard,- and, with their consent, an order was
entered making them, in their capacity as his assignees, parties defendant. They had the benefit of any defence they
might at any time have had, and assented that the hearing of
the cases should proceed. On the 21st of December, 1868, a
final decree was entered in the chancery court ascertaining the
amount of his indebtedness to the respective complainants,
and adjudging that the attached property be sold, free from
any right or equity of redemption in him, or in any of the other
defendants, and that the proceeds be applied in satisfaction of
the debts due the attaching creditors, -the surplus, if any, to
be paid to his assignees.
On the 1st of March, 1869, the day fixed for the sale of the
attached property, by the master's advertisement, Friedlander,
Stich, & Co. presented to the chancellor of the chancery court
a petition asserting, in virtue of their prior attachment in the
law court, a lien superior to that acquired by Davis and
others, under their respective attachments in the chancery
court, and praying that the sale, so far as it related to the
property covered by their attachment, be postponed; that they
be made parties to the consolidated equity suits; and that
their priority of lien be established. He declined to order the
postponement asked, but indorsed upon the petition that "the
sale will proceed, and the complainants to this bill may file
this, or a petition, in the consolidated causes to establish their
priority, if such exists, to the fund." It does not appear that
Friedlander, Stich, & Co. availed themselves of this right, or
gave any further attention to, or had any further connection
with, the chancery suits. The sale took place as advertised,
Hill becoming the purchaser of a part of the property at the
price of $2,500, while the remainder was struck off to Carter,
Kirtland, & Co., attaching creditors, at the price of $12,520.

DAVIS v.

FRIEDLANDER.

[Sup. Ct;.

The bids were less, by nearly one-half, than the aggregate
debts of the attaching creditors in the equity suits. No exceptions were filed to the report of sale. Hill complied with the
terms of sale, and his purchase was confirmed. A decree
was entered declaring that all the right, title, and interest
of the parties, in and to the property purchased by Hill, be
divested out of them, and vested in him. It does not appear,
from the transcript, that Carter, Kirtland, & Co. complied
with the terms of sale, or that any final action was taken by
the court as to their purchase. In July, 1869, Friedlander,
Stich, & Co. obtained judgment in the law court against
Kaufman for the sum of $19,311.81, the amount of their
claim, and also an order for the sale of the attached property,
the same previously sold under the decree. But that order
was suspended to await the consent of the court in bankruptcy to its execution, or until the further order of the law
court.
The present suit was commenced on the 20th of August,
1870, by Friedlander, Stich, & Co. filing their petition in the
District Court sitting in bankruptcy. The attaching creditors
in the suit in the chancery court, the purchasers at the sale of
March 1, 1869, and the assignees in bankruptcy of Kaufman
were made defendants. Its manifest object is to secure an
adjudication, establishing the prior lien of Friedlander, Stich,
& Co., as against the other attaching creditors, upon the real
estate attached, alike, in the suits in the law and the chancery courts of Memphis.
To that end a decree is asked
declaring the sales under the order of the latter court to be
void, and placing the attached property in the possession of
Kaufman's assignees, to be by them sold, under the order of
the bankruptcy court, - the proceeds of sale to be applied
first to the satisfaction of the judgment of Friedlander, Stich,
& Co., in the law court. The District Court disregarding
the sale made under the decree of the State court, gave those
parties all the relief asked, and its decree was affirmed by the
Circuit Court. Davis and the other creditors thereupon appealed.
Other facts are disclosed by the record, but in the view
taken of the case by the court it is unnecessary to state them.

DAvis v. FRIEDLANDER.

Mr. Fillmore Beall and Mr. William i. Randolph for the
appellants.
Mr. Lewis Abraham and Mr. Charles D. Mayer for the
appellees.
Mg. JUSTICE IIARLAN, after stating the facts, delivered the
opinion of the court.
In Doe v. Childress (21 Wall. 642), we considered the effect
of proceedings in bankruptcy upon an attachment issued from
a State court and levied upon the property of the bankrupt,
more than four months prior to their commencement. That
was an action of ejeetment, by the assignee of a bankrupt, to
recover land claimed by the defendant under a decretal sale in
an attachment suit in a State court against the bankrupt. The
latter was declared a bankrupt ten months after the institution
of the attachment suit, four months before the decree therein,
and seven months prior to the sale at which the defendant
became the purchaser of the land. Upon this state of facts
it was ruled that the proceedings in bankruptcy did not operate to dissolve the attachment ; that the debtor's title passed
to the assignee, subject to the lien created by the attachment;
and that a judgment could be entered for the sale of the
property, notwithstanding a discharge previously granted was
pleaded in bar of the action. It was said by the court that,
" where the power of a State court to proceed in a suit is subject to be impeached, it cannot be done except upon an intervention by the assignee, who shall state the facts and make
the proof necessary to terminate such jurisdiction. .

.

. If the

assignee had intervened in the suit, he would have been entitled
to the property or its proceeds, subject to this [the attachment]
lien. He did not, however, intervene or take any measures in
the case. He allowed the property to be sold under the judgments in the attachment suits, and those under whom the
defendant claims purchased it, obtaining a perfect title to the
saine."

In Scott v. Kelly (22 id. 57), it appears that the assignee
in bankruptcy became a party to an attachment suit in a State
court, commenced shortly before the defendant was declared a
bankrupt. The attachment was issued and levied after the

DAVIS v. FRIEDLANDER.

[Sup. Ct.

adjudication. The assignee claimed the attached property, but
the decision in the State court was adverse to him. Upon
writ of error to this court, we said that " the assignee in bankruptcy voluntarily submitted himself and his rights to the
jurisdiction of the State court. Being summoned, he appeared
without objection, and presented his claim for adjudication by
that court. No effort was made to remove the litigation to the
courts of the United States. It is now too late to object to
the power of the State court to act in the premises and render
judgment."
In BEyster v. Gaff (91 U. S. 521), the main question considered was whether a State court, in which a foreclosure suit
was pending at the time of the bankruptcy of the defendant,
had jurisdiction to proceed without bringing the assignee before
the court. The question arose in an action of ejectment instituted by the assignee against the purchaser at the decretal sale
in the foreclosure suit. Referring to the authority expressly
given the assignee by statute, to prosecute or defend all suits
in which the bankrupt was a party, the court said : " If there
was any reason for interposing, the assignee could have had
himself substituted for the bankrupt, or made a defendant on
petition. If he chose to let the suit proceed without such
defence, he stands as any other person would on whom the
title had fallen since the suit was commenced. It is a mistake
to suppose that the bankrupt law avoids, of its own force, all
judicial proceedings in the State or other courts the instant one
of the parties is adjudged a bankrupt. There is nothing in
the act which sanctions such a proposition. The court, in the
case before us, had acquired jurisdiction of the parties and of
the subject-matter of the suit. . . . Having such jurisdiction,
and performing its duty as the case stood in that court, we are
at a loss to see how its decree can be treated as void." Again:
" The debtor of a bankrupt, or the man who contests the right
to real or personal property with him, loses none of those
rights by the bankruptcy of his adversary. The same courts
remain open to him in such contests, and the statute has not
divested those courts of jurisdiction in such actions. If it has,
for certain classes of actions, conferred a jurisdiction, for the
benefit of the assignee, on the Circuit and District Courts of

Oct. 1881.]

DAVIS v. FRIEDLANDER.

the United States, it is concurrent with, and does not divest
that of, the State courts."
These doctrines were further elaborated in Claflin v. _1 ouseman (93 id. 130), where it was held that the assignee in bankruptcy, under the act of 1867, had authority to bring a suit
in the State courts, wherever those courts were invested with
appropriate jurisdiction suited to the nature of the case. See
also Jerome v. Mc Carter, 94 id. 734 ; lcHenry v. La SocWi6t
_Pravcaise, 95 id. 58.
The principles announced in the foregoing cases would seem
to be decisive of the main questions arising on this appeal, and
We are of opinion that the decree below cannot be sustained.
It rests, necessarily, upon the ground, that immediately upon
the assignment of the bankrupt's property to his assignees, the
State court of chancery - although the attachments therein
were sued out more than four months preceding the bankruptcy - had no jurisdiction to determine the relative rights
of the attaching creditors and the assignees in bankruptcy, or
to order a sale of the attached property, and apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of the debts of those creditors. But
no such position can be maintained. It was competent for the
assignees, upon their appointment and qualification, by appropriate proceedings, directed against individual creditors, suing
in other courts, to have brought all the property in which the
bankrupt had an interest, including that attached in the suits
in the State courts, under the direct control of the bankruptcy
court, to be disposed of under its orders, with due regard, however, to the previously acquired rights and equities, in whatever way arising, of all the creditors of Kaufman. But they
were not bound to pursue that course. Consistently with the
bankrupt law, as interpreted by this court, they were at liberty to appear in the State court, and assert there whatever
rights they, as assignees, had in the attached property. Electing to pursue the latter course, they voluntarily submitted to
the jurisdiction of the State court, which had ample authority
to adjudicate, between the attaching creditors and the assignees
in bankruptcy, upon all matters arising in the suits before it.
Without questioning (as they do not now) the debts of the
attaching creditors or the validity of their attachments, the

DAVIS V. FRIEDLANDER.

[Sup. Ct.

assignees became parties defendant in the equity suits. They
neither filed nor offered to file any formal pleading. Nor did
they advise the chancery court of the attachment of Friedlander, Stich, & Co. in the law court. They left that court to
adjudge what were their rights in the property attached. Its
final decree secured to them whatever surplus might remain
after applying the proceeds of sale to the demands of the
attaching creditors. If the bankrupt owed the attaching creditors the sums by them respectively claimed, and if the attachments were so issued and levied as, under the laws of the State,
to create a valid lien upon the property, it is clear that the
State court gave the assignees all that could have been
awarded them.
It results from what has been said, that the sale, under that
decree, - whoever became the purchasers of the attached property, whether third persons or parties to the suits, - divested
the assignees of whatever interest or title they had in the property. That decree, having been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction as to parties and subject-matter, and never
having been modified by the court which rendered it, or by
any court having authority to review its action, the assignees
are precluded from asserting in any other court any interest or
title whatever in the property thus sold. Had the present suit
been instituted directly by the assignees, for the purpose of
setting aside the sale made under the order of the State
court, and of procuring another sale of the attached property,
under the orders of the court in bankruptcy, the proceedings
in the State court would have been a conclusive answer to such
an action.
Plainly, therefore, the present suit by Friedlander, Stieh, &
Co. is an attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of the District
Court sitting in bankruptcy, to the end that they may establish, as against other creditors of Kaufman, their priority of
lien upon property, in which, as we have seen, the assignees
can now assert no right or interest for the benefit of general or
unsecured creditors. Whether appellees have such priority of
lien in virtue of their attachment in the law court ; whether
the proceedings in that court were such as, under the laws of
Tennessee, gave them a lien superioi to that acquired by the

respective attaching creditors in the suits in the chancery
court; whether, by reason of their petition addressed to the
chancellor of the latter court, and his action thereon, they
became, in any proper sense, parties to those suits, or bound by
the decree therein rendered, or, whether their rights were
altogether unaffected by that decree, - are all questions in
which the assignees have now no interest. These questions
concern only the respective attaching creditors in the law and
chancery courts, and for the determination of them the present appellees may not invoke the jurisdiction or aid of the
bankruptcy court. The decree, and the sale thereunder, withdrew the attached property from the assets of the bankrupt.
The property brought less than the claims of the attaching
creditors; and since the assignees cannot question, collaterally,
the proceedings in the State court, to which they voluntarily
became parties, they have no possible interest in this litigation.
It is, we repeat, a contest exclusively between attaching creditors as to priority of liens upon property in the disposition of
which, so far as we can ascertain from the present record,
the assignees have not the slightest pecuniary interest.
The decree of the Circuit Court will be, therefore, reversed,
with directions that the petition of Friedlander, Stich, & Co.,
filed in the District Court sitting in bankruptcy, be dismissed
with costs to the present appellants, but without prejudice to
any claim they may assert, by any proper proceedings in a
court of, competent jurisdiction, to a prior lien as against appellants, or others, upon the property levied upon by the
attachment in the law court of Memphis; and it is
So ordered.
