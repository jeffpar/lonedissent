QUINBY

V. CONLAN.

[Sup. Ct.

QUINBY V. CONLAN.
1. The verdict of a jury upon an issue which a court of chancery directed them
to try is merely advisory.
2. A party lawfully settling upon a portion of a quarter-section of public land,
who in good faith complies with the statutory requirements, is entitled as
against subsequent settlers to pre-empt that quarter-section, and they derive
no right thereto by purchasing the claim of a prior settler, unless, by
an actual entry at the proper office, he has a transferable interest in the
land.
3. The courts cannot exercise a direct appellate jurisdiction over the rulings of
the officers of the Land Department, nor reverse or correct them in a suit
between private parties.
4. Where, by misconstruing the law, those officers have withheld from a party
his just rights, or misrepresentation and fraud have been practised necessarily affecting their judgment, the courts may in a proper proceeding interfere and refuse to give effect to their action.

ERoR to the Supreme Court of the State of California.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Robert H. Bradford and Mr. Willis Drummond for the
plaintiff in error.
Mr. James Coleman for the defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This was an action for the possession of certain real property
in the county of Los Angeles, in the State of California. The
complaint is in the usual form in such actions, according to the
system of pleading prevailing in that State, alleging the ownership of the premises by the plaintiff and his right to their
possession on a day designated, the wrongful entry thereon by
the defendant, and his subsequent occupation thereof, to the
plaintiff's damage.
It also alleges the value of the rents and profits during the
occupation of the defendant, and prays judgment for restitution of the premises to the plaintiff, for his damages for their
occupation, and for the rents and profits lost.
The answer of the defendant denies the several allegations
of the complaint, and then sets up in a special count, by way
of a cross-complaint, various matters which, as be claims, constitute in equity a good defence to the action and entitle him

to a decree, that he has an equitable right to the premises, and
that the plaintiff holds the legal title for him.
Under the system of pleading which obtains in California an
equitable defence of this nature, as well as a defence at law,
may be set up to an action for the possession of land. In such
case the grounds of equitable relief must be set forth separately
from the defence at law. The answer presenting them is in
the nature of a bill in equity, and must contain all its essential
allegations. It must disclose a case which, if established, will
justify a decree adjudging that the title be transferred to the
defendant, or enjoining the further prosecution of the action.
The equitable defence is, therefore, first to be disposed of by
the court before the legal remedy is considered. Upon its
disposition the necessity of proceeding with the legal action
will depend. When that action does proceed, the ordinary
rules as to the controlling influence of the legal title will apply.
Estradc v. Murphy, 19 Cal. 248, 273; Arguello v. Edinger,
10 id. 150.
This statement will explain what otherwise would appear
singular in the record, that one judge heard the issues raised
by the special answer in the nature of a cross-complaint in
equity, and another judge of the same court subsequently
tried the issues in the action at law.

There was no more im-

propriety in this hearing of the different issues by different
judges, or incongruity with established modes of procedure,
than there would have been had the issues in the cross-action
been presented in an independent suit.

The grounds put forth for equitable relief consist of alleged
erroneous rulings of the Land Department upon two matters, the possession and improvement of the lands in controversy by
the parties claiming a pre-emption right to them; and the time
when that portion of the lands in controversy, claimed to be
within the limits of a confirmed Mexican grant, was shown,
by a survey of the grant and the appropriation of other lands
to its satisfaction, to be without them and thus open to settlement and pre-emption.
1. The lands in controversy constitute the west half and
The plaintiff,
the southeast quarter of a quarter-section.
Conlan, entered upon them in February, 1865, occupying a

QUINBY v. CONLAN.

[Sup. Ct.

portion thereof, and declaring his purpose to acquire, as a
settler, a pre-emption right to them. The township was surveyed by the authorities of the United States in February,
1868, and the plat filed in the proper land-office in April following. In May, 1868, Conlan filed his declaratory statement
in the form required by law, claiming the quarter-section as
a pre-emptor. In May, 1869, four years after Conlan's settlement, the defendant, Quinby, settled upon the quarter-section,
occupying a portion thereof, declaring his intention to acquire,
as a settler, a pre-emptive right to the land, and in November, 1871, he filed his declaratory statement claiming it as a
pre-emptor. Previously to his possession various parties had
occupied portions of the section, and had conveyed to him whatever interest they held. It would seem from the answer and
the frequent reference to the prior occupation of these parties,
that it was supposed that this fact in some way increased the
equity of his possession and gave him a better pre-emptive
right to the lands than that claimed by the plaintiff. But to
this position there are two answers: 1st, It does not appear
that the grantors of the defendant ever contemplated the
acquisition of a pre-emptive right to the lands by their settlement; and, 2d, The act of Congress forbids the sale of preemptive rights to the public lands acquired by settlement and
improvement. The general pre-emption law declares that all
transfers and assignments of rights thus obtained prior to the
issuing of the patent shall be null and void. This court held
at the purpose of the prohibition -that it did not
-looking
forbid the sale of the land after the entry was effected, that is,
after the right to a patent had become vested, but did apply
to all prior transfers. The policy of preventing speculation
through the instrumentality of temporary settlers would otherwise be defeated. Myers v. Croft, 13 Wall. 291.
The claim of the defendant to a right of pre-emption stands,
therefore, in no better plight than if there had been no prior
occupant of the lands. His own settlement can alone be considered, and that dates, as already said, from May, 1869. He
had no claim to the lands when the plaintiff settled upon them,
and he acquired none by his purchase of parties who had previously occupied them.

Oct. 1881.]

QUINBY V. CONLAN.

Ile must also be considered as settling upon them with notice
of the plaintiff's prior claim by his declaratory statement filed
in the land-office the year before. The plaintiff could not, it
is true, have asserted a pre-emptive right to the whole quartersection as against parties at the time of his settlement in the
occupation of a portion of them. Had such parties followed
up their occupation and improvement by a declatatory statement when the public surveys were extended over the lands,
the case would have been different. A settlement cannot be
made upon public land already occupied; as against existing
occupants, the settlement of another is ineffectual to establish
a pre-emptive right. Such is the purport of our decisions in
Atherton v. Fowler, 96 U. S. 513, and Hosmer v. Wallace, 97
id. 575.
But a settlement upon a portion of a quarter-section, and
making the improvements required by law, will sustain a preemptive claim to the whole quarter-section as against subsequent settlers; and such subsequent settlement is not improved, or in any respect rendered more efficacious, by the fact
of purchase from earlier occupants. The settlement which the
law of Congress will recognize - except where the claim is
made by a widow or heirs of a deceased settler - must be personal to the settler, and not that of others who may have conveyed to him.
2. As to the time when the portion of the land in controversy, originally claimed to be within the boundaries of a
Mexican grant, was, by the survey of the grant, and the appropriation of other lands to its satisfaction, excluded from them,
and thus became open to settlement and pre-emption, only a
few words are necessary.
It does not clearly appear from the record what portion of
the land in controversy was covered by the claim under the
Mexican grant. It would seem, from the complaint, to have
been the southeast quarter of the quarter-section ; but it is not
material. The court found that the grant was surveyed in
January or February, 1868, under the act of Congress of July
3, 1866, c. 219, entitled "An Act to quiet land-titles in California;" that such survey was finally approved, and a patent
issued upon it; and that the land in controversy was not in-

QUINBY V. CONLAN.

[Sup. Ct.

eluded within it, but "was public land and subject to pre-emption " at the time the plaintiff filed his declaratory statement.
The jury, it is true, found, generally, the reverse of this,- that
the land was claimed to be within the boundaries of the grant
when the declaratory statement was filed. Hence it is contended that the approval of the survey must be considered as
subsequently given. It is also contended that a similar conclsion must follow from the period, required by the act of July
1, 1864, for the publication of notice of the survey of a confirmed Mexican grant, before it could be forwarded to the landoffice at Washington for approval. But to this argument or
assumption there is a satisfactory answer. If there be in an
equity case - and so far as the issues upon the eross-complain t
are concerned they are to be treated as arising in a proceeding
of that character-a conflict between the finding of the court
and that of the jury, the former prevails. The finding of the
jury is only advisory, and the court may disregard it, and follow
its own judgment upon the evidence. Basey v. Gallagher,20
Wall. 670, 680.
The survey in the case was made under the eighth section of
the act of 1866, and was not subject to the provisions of the
act of 1864, requiring publication of it before approval by
the Commissioner of the General Land-Office. The statute of
1866 declares that in cases where no request is made within
ten months after its passage, or within that period after any
subseqent final confirmation, for a survey of a claim under
a confirmed Mexican grant, pursuant to sects. 6 and 7 of
the act of 1864, the surveyor-general of the United States
for California shall cause the line of the public surveys to be
extended over the land, and shall set off, in full satisfaction
of the grant, and according to the lines of the public surveys,
the quantity confirmed, and that the land not included in
the grant thus set off by him shall be subject to the general
laws of the United States. The survey by that officer of the
grant, and the application of land to its satisfaction, as thus
prescribed, could undoubtedly have been disapproved by the
Commissioner of the General Land-Office, and, had their correctness been contested, they might have been treated as inoperative until approved. But the approval by that officer,

Oct. 1881.]

QUINBY V. CONLAN.

when given, took effect by relation as of the date when the
survey and appropriation were niade. They must be held
valid from that time, so as to protect proceedings taken in
accordance with them.
There was, therefore, nothing in the showing made by the
defendant to justify the court below in granting the relief
prayed, even if we were to take into consideration the facts
stated as grounds of relief.
But independently of this conclusion there is a general answer to the alleged erroneous rulings of the officers of the
Land Department as grounds for the interference of the court.
Those rulings were upon mere matters of fact, or upon mixed
questions of law and fact, which were properly cognizable and
determinable by the officers of that department.
The laws of the United States prescribe with particularity
the manner in which portions of the public domain may be
acquired by settlers. They require personal settlement upon
the lands desired and their inhabitation and improvement, and
a declaration of the settler's acts and purposes to be made in
the proper office of the district, within a limited time after the
public surveys have been extended over the lands. By them a
land department has been created to supervise all the various
steps required for the acquisition of the title of the government.

Its officers are required to receive, consider, and pass upon the
proofs furnished as to the alleged settlements upon the lands,
and their improvement, when pre-emption rights are claimed,
and, in case of conflicting claims to the same tract, to hear the
contesting parties. The proofs offered in compliance with the
law are to be presented, in the first instance, to the officers of
the district where the land is situated, and from their decision
an appeal lies to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office,
and from him to the Secretary of the Interior. For mere
errors of judgment as to the weight of evidence on these subjects, by any of the subordinate officers, the only remedy is by
an appeal to his superior of the department. The courts cannot exercise any direct appellate jurisdiction over the rulings
of those officers or of their superior in the department in such
matters, nor can they reverse or correct them in a collateral
proceeding between private parties.

QUINBY V. CONLAN.

[Sup. Ct.

In this case the allegation that false and fraudulent representations, as to the settlement of the plaintiff, were made to
the officers of the Land Department is negatived by the finding
of the court. It would lead to endless litigation, and be fruitful of evil, if a supervisory power were vested in the courts
over the action of the numerous officers of the Land Department, on mere questions of fact presented for their determination. It is only when those officers have misconstrued the law
applicable to the case, as established before the department,
and thus have denied to parties rights which, upon a correct
construction, would have been conceded to them, or where
misrepresentations and fraud have been practised, necessarily
affecting their judgment, that the courts can, in a proper proceeding, interfere and refuse to give effect to their action. On
this subject we have repeatedly and with emphasis expressed
our opinion, and the matter should be deemed settled. Johnson
v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72; Shepley v. Cowan, 91 U. S. 330-340;
JIoore v. Robbins, 96 id. 530.
And we may also add, in this connection, that the misconstruction of the law by the officers of the department,
which will authorize the interference of the court, must be
clearly manifest, and not alleged upon a possible finding of the
facts from the evidence different from that reached by them.
And where fraud and misrepresentations are relied upon as
grounds of interference by the court, they should be stated
with such fulness and particularity as to show that they
must necessarily have affected the action of the officers of
the department. Mere general allegations of fraud and misrepresentations will not suffice. United States v. Atherton,
102 U. S. 372.
In the present case the respective claims of the parties to a
pre-emptive right to the land in controversy, from their settlement and improvements, had been the subject of earnest contestation before the officers of the Land Department, and a
decision in favor of the plaintiff was finally rendered by the
Secretary of the Interior. And the question whether the land
in controversy had been so freed from its reservation under
the Mexican grant as to be open to settlement and pre-emption
depended upon matters disclosed by the record of proceedings

in the Land Department, namely, that the public surveys had
been extended over the land, and that other lands had been
appropriated to the satisfaction of the grant.
Judgment affirmed.

BOUGrITON V. EXCHANGE BANK.
This court has no jurisdiction to re-cxamine the judgment of a State court,
unless the record shows, affirmatively or by fair implication, that a Federal
question, necessary to the determination of the cause, is involved.

to dismiss a writ of error to the Supreme Court of
the State of Pennsylvania.
This was a suit brought in the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia, by the American Exchange National Bank,
against John W. Boughton, upon two promissory notes,
whereof he was the maker. His affidavit of defence, alleging
usury, having been declared to be insufficient, judgment was
rendered against him, which was affirmed by the Supreme
Court of the State. He then sued out this writ.
MOTION

Mr. Samuel Wagner in support of the motion.
Hr. Thomas Greenbanl, contra.
Mr. CHimF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
To give us jurisdiction for the review of a judgment of a
State court, the record nnst show affirmatively, or by fair implication, that some Federal question was involved which was
necessary to the determination of the cause. The defence set
up in this case was that the notes sued on were void for usury
under the laws of New York, where they were made. Judgment was given against the plaintiff in error for want of a
sufficient affidavit of defence. This judgment would be right
if the affidavit was not such as was required by law or the
practice of the court for the presentation of a defence like that
relied on. As it is incumbent on him to show by the record, not
only that this'was not the ground of the decision below, but
