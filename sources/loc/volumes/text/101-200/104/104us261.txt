1. A person not notified of an action nor a party thereto, and who had no opportunity or right to control the defence, introduce or cross-examine witnesses, or to prosecute a writ of error, is not bound by the judgment therein
rendered.
2. Although words of proviso and condition may be construed as words of
covenant, if such be the apparent intent and meaning of the parties, covenant will not arise unless it can be collected from the whole instrument
that there was on the part of the person sought to be charged an agreement, or an engagement, to do or not to do some act.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wash-

ington.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. John 11. Mitchell for the plaintiffs in error.
Mr.Elbridge G. Lapham, contra.
Mn. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.

On the first day of May, 1864, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, then engaged in the transportation, for hire, of
freight and passengers on the Columbia River and its tributaries, purchased a steamboat, called the " New World," from
the California Steam Navigation Company, then engaged in
like business upon the rivers, bays, and waters of the State of
California.
The terms of the sale are embodied in a written agreement,
from which it appears that the consideration was $75,000, and
the covenant and agreement of the vendees, not only that they
would not " run or employ, or suffer to be run or employed, the

said steamboat 'New World' upon any of the routes of travel
upon the rivers, bays, and waters of the State of California for
the period of ten years from the first day of May, 1864," but
that its machinery should not be "run or employed in running
any steamboat, vessel, or craft upon any of the routes of travel,
or on the rivers, bays, or waters of" that Statefor that period.
The Oregon Steam Navigation Company, in that agreement,
further stipulated, that, in case of any breach of their covenant
and agreement, they would pay the California Steam Navigation Company the sum of $75,000 in gold coin of the United
States " as actual liquidated damages,"-such stipulation, however, not to have the effect to prevent the latter from taking
such other remedy, by injunction or otherwise, as they might be
advised.
On the 18th of February, 1867, the Oregon Steam Navigation
Company sold the "New World" to Henry Winsor, Clanrick
Crosby, N. Crosby, Jr., and Calvin H. Hale, and executed to
Winsor a bill of sale stating the consideration to be $75,000.
That instrument, after setting out the covenant of the vendors
to warrant and defend the steamboat and all its appurtenances
against all persons whomsoever, recited that "it was understood
and agreed" that the sale was "upon the express condition"
that the steamboat should not run, nor its machinery be used in
running, any other steamboat, vessel, or craft, within ten years
from the first day of May, 1867, on any of the routes of travel
on the rivers, bays, or waters of the State of California, or on
the Columbia River and its tributaries.
At the time of the making of that bill of sale Winsor and his
associates, with L. D. Howe and A. R. Elder as their sureties,
executed an additional writing, similar in all respects to that
before mentioned as having been executed by the Oregon Steam
Navigation Company on the 1st of May, 1864, except that
Winsor and his associates, in the paper by them signed, covenanted and agreed that the " New World" should not, for the
period of ten years from May 1, 1867, be run, or suffered to be
run or employed, nor its machinery used in any other steamboat on the rivers, bays, or waters of the Statp of California, or
on the Columbia River and its tributaries.
On the 5th of March, 1867, Winsor executed to Hale a bill of

Oct. 1881.]

HALE V. FINCH.

sale of the "New World," reciting a consideration of $75,000,
and by the terms of which the former, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, promised, covenanted, and agreed
to and with Hale to warrant and defend the title to the steamboat, her boilers, engines, machinery, tackle, apparel, &c.
On the 23d of November, 1867, Hale executed to Finch, the
defendant in error, a bill of sale, reciting a consideration of
$50,000, and containing among others the following clauses: " And I, the said Calvin H. Hale, have, and by these presents do promise, covenant, and agree, for myself, my heirs,
executors, and administrators, to and with the said Duncan B.
Finch, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, to warrant and defend the whole of said steamboat INew World,'
her engines, boilers, machinery, and all the other before-mentioned appurtenances, against all and every person and persons
whomsoever.
"And it is understood and agreed that this sale is upon
this express condition, that said steamboat or vessel is not
within ten years from the first day of May, 1867, to be run
upon any of the routes of travel on the rivers, bays, or waters
of the State of California, or the Columbia River or its tributaries, and that during the same period last aforesaid the machinery of the said steamboat shall not be run, or be employed
in running any steamboat or vessel or craft upon any of the
routes of travel on the rivers, bays, or waters of the State of
California, or the Columbia River and its tributaries."
At the same time a separate written agreement was entered
into between Finch and Hale, from which it appears that the
former, in terms, covenanted and agreed to do various things
which have no connection with this case, and need not, therefore, be here specified. It is only important to observe, as to
that separate agreement, that it did not embrace any covenant
or agreement whatever on the part of Finch against the use of
the steamboat "New World," or of its mchinery, upon the
waters of California, or upon the Columbia River or its tributaries.
The present action was brought against Finch by Hale and
those associated with him in the purchase from the Oregon
Steam Navigation Company.

HALE

v.

FINCH.

[Sup. Ct.

The complaint avers that, in all of said transactions, Winsor,
as the defendant well knew, represented his co-plaintiffs as well
as himself; that the defendant, in violation of his promise and
agreement, made at the time he purchased the steamboat,
caused, suffered, and permitted the same to be taken to San
Francisco, on or about the first day of October, 1868, and from
that date up to May 1, 1874, caused, suffered, and permitted
it to be run upon the routes of travel on the rivers, bays, and
waters of California; that on Oct. 5, 1869, the Oregon Steam
Navigation Company sued the plaintiffs and their sureties,
Howe and Elder, to recover the sum of $75,000, fixed as liquidated damages for the breach of the covenants and agreements
contained in the within memorandum of Feb. 18, 1867, the ground of said action being that the defendants therein
had run the steamboat "New World," or suffered and permitted it to be run, on the rivers, bays, and waters of California, after Nov. 1, 1868, and prior to May 1, 1874, which
acts, it is averred, are the same now complained of as constituting a breach of the defendant's alleged agreement of Nov.
23, 1867 (20 Wall. 64) ; and that, in said action, the Oregon
Steam Navigation Company recovered a judgment against
the present plaintiffs for $75,000, which sum, with $4,000 expended in defending the suit, they had been compelled to
pay.
Judgment is asked against Finch for $79,000 in damages,
for the violation of his alleged agreement and promise.
The answer puts in issue all the material allegations of the
complaint, except the fact that the steamboat, subsequently to
the purchase by Finch, was used upon the waters of the State
of California during the period charged.
The defendant, in addition, pleads: 1. That the alleged
agreement was void under the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries
of the Territory, in that it was not, and is not, to be performed
in one year from the making thereof, and was not, nor was any
note or memorandum thereof, in writing, signed by the defendant, according to the provision of the statute; 2. That the steamboat was taken to California, and run upon the waters and bays
of that State, by the leave and license of the plaintiff, given to
the defendant on the first day of July, 1868; 3. That the action

V. FINCH.

is barred by the limitations of three and six years, prescribed
by the statute of the Territory.
There was a verdict for the defendant, in obedience to a peremptory instruction by the court, and the judgment rendered
thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory.
From that judgment of affirmance this writ of error is prosecuted.
Upon the filing in the Supreme Court of the Territory, of the
judgment and mandate of this court, in Oregon Steam Mavigation Co. v. Winsor (20 Wall. 64), that cause was remitted to
the court of original jurisdiction, for further proceedings according to law. The defendants therein obtained leave to withdraw, and did withdraw, their answers. Judgment by default
was thereupon entered against them for the sum of $75,000, the
amount fixed as actual liquidated damages, with interest and
costs. Satisfaction thereof was entered at the same term of
the court. That judgment, it is contended, by the present defendant, was obtained by collusion between the parties to that
action. It is further claimed that it has never, in fact, been
satisfied. Whether these charges are true, we need not here
inquire. And it is scarcely necessary to say that that judgment is not conclusive of the rights of the present defendant.
He was not a party to that action, nor notified of its pendency.
Ile had no opportunity or right, in that case, to controvert the
claim of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, to control the
defence, to introduce or cross-examine witnesses, or to prosecute
a writ of error to the judgment. Railroad Company v. National
Bank, 102 U. S. 14. Besides, that case was founded upon
the written covenant and agreement of Winsor and his associates with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, while the
liability of Finch to the plaintiffs in this action depends altogether upon the construction which may be given to the bill of
sale executed to him by Hale. If the record of the case of the
Oregon Steam Navigation Co. v. Winsor, &c., is competent evidence in this action, for any purpose, it can only be to show
the amount of damages which Winsor and his associates have
sustained, by reason of the "New World " being run on the
waters of California after Finch became owner.
But the liability of those parties for such damages arose out

HALE V. FINCH.

[Sup. Ct,

of the covenant and agreement which they made with the
Oregon Steam Navigation Company. With that transaction,
however, Finch had no connection, and unless he made a similar covenant and agreement with those from whom he purchased, - thereby becoming interested in keeping the covenant
and agreement made with that company by Winsor and his
associates, -he
cannot be affected by the judgment obtained
against the latter.
This brings us to the main contention on behalf of the plaintiffs in error; viz., that the language of the bill of sale from Hale
to Finch, if interpreted in the light of all the circumstances attending its execution, imports a covenant upon the part of the
latter that he would not use or permit the use by others, of the
steamboat or its machinery, within a prescribed period, either
upon the waters, rivers, and bays of California, or upon the
Columbia River and its tributaries. If, however, the language,
properly interpreted, imports only a condition, for breach of
which the vendor had no remedy other than by suit to recover
the property sold, then it is, as indeed it must be, conceded,
that the judgment below is right.
We are of opinion that the latter construction is the proper
one.
If we look both at the circumstances preceding, and at those
immediately attending, the purchase by Finch, and if we even
impute to him full knowledge of everything that occurred, as
well when the Oregon Steam Navigation Company made its
original purchase, as when it subsequently sold to Winsor and
his associates, - all which counsel for plaintiffs contends we are
bound, by the settled rules of law, to do, - what do we find?
The written memorandum between that company and the
California Steam Navigation Company, in words aptly chosen,
shows, as we have seen, an express covenant and agreement,
upon the part of the former, that neither the "New World"
nor its machinery should be used on the waters of California
within ten years from May 1, 1864, and also that a certain sum,
as actual liquidated damages, should be paid for any breach of
such covenant and agreement. The bill of sale from the Oregon Steam Navigation Company to Winsor and his associates
does not contain any words of covenant or agreement. But

Oct. 1881.]

HALE V. FINCH.

that company, in view of its express covenants to the California
Steam Navigation Company, took care to exact from its vendees
a separate written obligation, in which the latter, in express
terms, covenanted and agreed with that company, in like manner as the latter had covenanted and agreed with the California Steam Navigation Company. The next writing executed
is the bill of sale from Winsor to Hale. It shows nothing
more than a covenant to warrant the title to the steamboat,
and makes no reference, in any form, to any waters from which
the steamboat should be excluded. Then comes the bill of
sale executed by Hale to Finch. Its material portions are the
same in substance, and, in language, almost identical with that
given by the Oregon Steam Navigation to Winsor. Each contains a covenant and agreement, upon the part of the vendor,
simply to warrant and defend the title to the steamboat, its
machinery, &c., againsb all persons whomsoever.
But each
recites, let it be observed, only an agreement that the sale is
upon the express condition that it shall not be used or employed
upon those waters. Upon the sale by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company to Winsor and his associates, the former, as
we have seen, was careful to take the separate obligation of the
latter, with surety, containing covenants and agreements, described in such terms as to show that the draughtsman, as well
as all parties, knew the difference between a covenant and a
condition. The same criticism may be made in reference to
the separate writing signed by Finch and Hale, at the time of
the execution by the latter of the bill of sale to the former.
The latter writing shows, it is true, several covenants and
agreements upon the part of Finch, but no covenant or agreement in reference to the use of the boat, such as is found in the
writings which passed between the California Steam Navigation and the Oregon Steam Navigation, or such as are contained
in the separate agreement between the latter and Winsor and
his associates.
If, therefore, we suppose (which we could not do without discrediting some of the testimony) that Finch, at the time of his
purchase, had knowledge of all the papers executed upon prior
sales of the " New World," the absence, as well from the bill
of sale accepted by him, as from the written agreement of the

HALE V. FINCH.

[Sup. Ct.

same date, signed by him and Hale, of any covenant or agreement that he would not use that vessel, or permit it to be used,
on the prohibited waters within the period prescribed, quite
conclusively shows that he never intended to assume the personal responsibility which would result from such a covenant.
It thus appears that the circumstances, separately considered,
militate against the construction for which plaintiff contends.
But if we omit all consideration of the circumstances under
which the bill of sale from Hale to Finch was executed, and
look solely at the language employed in that instrument, there
seems to be no ground upon which the claim of plaintiff can
stand. The words are precise and unambiguous. No room
is left for construction.
It is undoubtedly true, as argued
by counsel, that neither express words of covenant, nor any
particular technical words, nor any special form of words, is
necessary in order to charge a party with covenant. 1 Roll.
Abr. 518; Sant v. Norris, 1 Burr. 287; Williamson v. Codrington, 1 Ves. 511, 516; Courtney v. Taylor, 7 Scott, N. R.
749. " The law," says Bacon, "does not seem to have appropriated any set form of words which are absolutely necessary
to be made use of in creating a covenant." Bac. Abr., Covenant, A. So in Sheppard's Touchstone, 161, 162, it is said:
"There need not be any formal words, as ' covenant,' 'promise,' and the like, to make a covenant on which to ground an
action of covenant, for a covenant may be had by any other
words; and upon any part of an agreement in writing, in whatsoever words it be set down, for anything to be or not to be
done, the party to or with whom the promise or agreement is
made may have his action upon the breach of the agreement."
Mr. Parsons says, "Words of proviso and condition will be
construed into words of covenant, when such is the apparent
intention and meaning of the parties." 2 Parsons, Contracts,
23. There are also cases in the books in which it has been
held that even a recital in a deed may amount to a covenant.
Farrall v. Hilditch, 5 C. B. N. S. 840; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Harrison, 12 C. B. 576; Severn and Clerk's Case,
1 Leon. 122. And there are cases in which the instrument
to be construed was held to contain both a condition and a
covenant; as, "If a man by indenture letteth lands for years,

Oct. 1881.]

HALE v. FINCH.

provided always, and it is covenanted and agreed between the
said parties, that the lessee should not alien." It was adjudged that this was "a condition by force of the proviso, and
a covenant by force of the other words." Co. Litt. 203 b.
But according to the authorities, including some of those
above cited, and from the reason and sense of the thing, a covenant will not arise unless it can be collected from the whole
instrument that there was an agreement, or promise, or engagement, upon the part of the person sought to be charged, for the
performance or non-performance of some act. Comyns, in his
Digest (Covenant, A, 2), says that "any words in a deed which
show an agreement to do a thing, make a covenant." "But,"
says the same author, "where words do not amount to an
agreement, covenant does not lie; as, if they are merely conditional to defeat the estate; as, a lease, provided and upon
condition that the lessee collect and pay the rents of his other
houses." Comyns, Dig., Covenant, A, 3. The language last
quoted is found also in Platt's Treatise on the Law of Covenants. Law Library, vol. iii. p. 17. It there appears in connection with his reference to the case where A. leased to B.
for years, on condition that he should acquit the lessor of
ordinary and extraordinary charges, and should keep and leave
the houses at the end of the term in as good plight as he found
them. In such case, the author remarks, the lessee was held
liable to an action for omitting to leave the houses in good
plight, "for here an agreement was implied."
Applying these doctrines to the case before us, its solution is
not difficult. Without stopping to consider whether a covenant upon the part of Finch could arise out of a bill of sale
which he did not sign, but merely accepted from his vendor
(Platt, Covenants, ch. 1), it is sufficient to say that the instrument contains no agreement or engagement or promise by
him that he would or would not do anything. There is, in
terms, a covenant by Hale to Finch to defend the title to the
boat and its machinery against all persons whomsoever. This
is immediately followed by language implying an agreement
that the sale was upon the express condition that neither the boat
nor its machinery should be used within a prescribed time upon
certain waters. It is the case of a bare, naked condition, un-

HALE V. FINCH.

[Sup. Ct.

accompanied by words implying an agreement, engagement, or
promise by the vendee that he would personally perform, or
become personally responsible for its performance. The vende e
took the property subject to the right which the law reserved
to the vendor, of recovering it upon breach of the condition
specified. The vendee was willing, as the words in their
natural and ordinary sense indicate, to risk the loss of the steamboat when such breach occurred, but not to incur the personal
liability which would attach to a covenant or agreement upon
his part, that he would not use, and should not permit others
to use, the boat or its machinery upon the waters and within
the period named. If this be not so, then every condition in a
deed or other instrument, however bald that instrument might
be of language implying an agreement, could be turned, by
mere construction and against the apparent intention of the
parties, into a covenant involving personal responsibility. The
vendor having expressly, and the vendee impliedly, agreed that
the sale was upon an express condition, -stated in such form
as to preclude the idea of personal responsibility upon the part
of the vendee,-we should give effect to their intention, thus
distinctly declared.
This conclusion disposes of the case, and relieves us of the
necessity of considering other questions of an interesting nature
which counsel have discussed.
Judgment affirmed.
