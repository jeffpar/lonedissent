UNITED

STATES v. McBRATNEY.

UNITED STATES V.

McBRATNEY.

The Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Colorado has no juris.
diction of an indictment against a white man for the murder of a white man
within the Ute Reservation in the State of Colorado.

CERTIFICATE Of division of opinion from the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Colorado.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

The Solicitor-General for the United States.
Mr. Thomas G. Putnam,, contra.
delivered the opinion of the court.
The defendant, having been indicted and convicted, in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Colorado,
of the murder of Thomas Casey, within the boundaries of the
Ute Reservation in that district, moved in arrest of judgment
for want of jurisdiction of the court. The indictment does not
allege that either the accused or the deceased was an Indian.
The certificate of division, upon which the case has been
brought to this court, states that at the trial it appeared that
both were white men, and that the murder was committed in
the district of Colorado, within the Ute Reservation, the said
Ute Reservation lying wholly within the exterior limits of the
State of Colorado; and that, upon the motion ir!
arrest of judgment coming on to be heard before Mr. Justice Miller and
Judge Hallett, their opinions were opposed upon this question:
" Whether the Circuit Court of the United States sitting in
and for the district of Colorado has jurisdiction of the crime
of murder, committed by a white man upon a white man,
within the Ute Reservation in said district, and within the geographical limits of the State of Colorado."
The Circuit Courts of the United States have jurisdiction of
the crime of murder committed in any "place or district of
country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States ;"
and, except where special provision is made, "the general laws
of the United States as to the punishment of crimes committed
in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the

sect. 5339, cl. 1.
By the second article of the treaty between the United
States and the Ute Indians, of March 2, 1868, the United
States agreed that a certain district of country therein described should be set apart for the absolute and undisturbed
use and occupation of the Indians therein named, and of such
other friendly tribes or individual Indians as from time to time
they might be willing, with the consent of the United States,
to admit among them; and that no persons, except those
therein authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents,
and employ6s of the government as might be authorized to
enter upon Indian reservations in discharge of duties enjoined
by law, should ever be permitted.to pass over, settle upon, or
reside in the territory so described, except as otherwise provided in the treaty. The sixth article provided that, "if bad
men among the whites or among other people, subject to the
authority of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon
the person or property of the Indians," the United States,
upon proof made to the agent, and forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, would proceed at once to cause the
offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of
the United States and "if bad men among the Indians shall
commit a wrong or depredation upon the person or property of
any one, white, black, or Indian, subject to the authority of the
United States and at peace therewith, the tribes herein named
solemnly agree that they will, on proof made to their agent, and
notice to him, deliver up the wrong-doer to the United States, to
be tried and punished according to its laws." By the seventh
article, "the President may at any time order a survey of the
reservation, and, when so surveyed, Congress shall provide for
protecting the rights of such Indian settlers in their improvements, and may fix the character of the title held by each ; "
and "the United States may pass such laws on the subject of
alienation and descent of property, and on all subjects connected with the government of the Indians on said reservation
and the internal police thereof, as may be thought proper."
15 Stat. 619-621.

UNITED STATES v. M BRATNEY.

By the first section of the act of Congress of Feb. 28, 1861,
c. 59, to provide a temporary government for the Territory of
Colorado, all territory which, by treaty with any Indian tribe,
was not, without its consent, to be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory, was excepted
out of the boundaries and constituted no part of the Territory
of Colorado ; and by the sixteenth section, "the Constitution
and all laws of the United States which are not locally inapplicable shall have the same force and effect within the said
Territory of Colorado as elsewhere within the United States."
12 Stat. 172, 176. If this provision of the first section had remained in force after Colorado became a State, this indictment
might doubtless have been maintained in the Circuit Court of
the United States. United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567;
Bates v. Clark, 95 U. S. 204; United States v. Ward, 1 Woolw.
17, 21.
But the act of Congress of March 3, 1875, c. 139, for the admission of Colorado into the Union, authorized the inhabitants
of the Territory "to form for themselves out of said Territory
a State government, with the name of the State of Colorado;
which State, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union
upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects
whatsoever;" and the act contains no exception of the Ute
Reservation, or of jurisdiction over it. 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 474.
The provision of section one of the subsequent act of June
26, 1876, c. 147 (19 Stat. 61), that upon the admission of the
State of Colorado into the Union "the laws of the United
States, not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force and
effect within the State as elsewhere within the United States,"
does not create any such exception. Such a provision has a
less extensive effect within the limits of one of the States of
the Union than in one of the Territories of which the United
States have sole and exclusive jurisdiction.
The act of March 3, 1875, necessarily repeals the provisions
of any prior statute, or of any existing treaty, which are clearly
inconsistent therewith. The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616.

[Sup. Ct.

The Kansas Indians,
5 Wall. 787; United States v. Ward, supra. The State of
Colorado, by its admission into the Union by Congress, upon
an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, without any such exception as had been made in the
treaty with the Ute Indians and in the act establishing a
territorial government, has acquired criminal jurisdiction over
its own citizens and other white persons throughout the
whole of the territory within its limits, including the Ute
Reservation, and that reservation is no longer within the sole
and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. The courts of
the United States have, therefore, no jurisdiction to punish
crimes within that reservation, unless so far as may be necessary to carry out such provisions of the treaty with the Ute
Indians as remain in force. But tlat treaty contains no stipulation for the punishment of offences committed by white men
against white men. It follows that the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Colorado has no jurisdiction
of this indictment, but, according to the practice heretofore
adopted in like cases, should deliver up the prisoner to the
authorities of the State of Colorado to be dealt witbh according
to law. United States v. Cisna, 1 McLean, 254, 265; Coleman
v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 519.
The record before us presents no question under the provisions of the treaty as to the punishment of crimes committed
by or against Indians, the protection of the Indians in their
improvements, or the regulation by Congress of the alienation
and descent of property and the government and internal
police of the Indians. The single question that we do or can
decide in this case is that stated in the certificate of division
of opinion, namely, whether the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Colorado has jurisdiction of the
crime of murder committed by a white man upon a white
man within the Ute Reservation, and within the limits of the
State of Colorado; and, for the reasons above given, that
question must be
Answered in the negative.
