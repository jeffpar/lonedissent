A., in 1879, imported sugars to which an artificial color was not given after they
had been manufactured. Hed, that, under schedule G, sect. 2504, Rev. Stat.,
the sole test of their dutiable quality was their actual color, as graded by the
Dutch standard, and that they were subject to the duties prescribed by that
schedule, with twenty-five per cent added thereto, pursuant to sect. 3 of the
act of March 3, 1875, c. 125, 18 Stat. 339.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of New York.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

The Solicitor- General for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. William H. -Evarts, Mr. Stephen G. Clarce, and Mr.
Edwin B. Smith, contra.
MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was an action brought by S. & W. Welsh, the plaintiffs
below, to recover back duties alleged by them to have been
illegally exacted by Merritt, the defendant below, as collector
of the port of New York, on certain sugars imported by them.
The importations were made in 1879, and were subject to
the duties imposed by schedule G, sect. 2504, of the Revised
Statutes, and by the third section of the act of March 3, 1875,
c. 127, which are in the following words : " SECT. 2504: Schedule G:

" Sugar not above number seven, Dutch standard in color: one
and three-quarter cents per pound.
"Sugar above number seven, and not above number ten, Dutch
standard in color : two cents per pound.
" Sugar above number ten, and not above number thirteen,
Dutch standard in color: two and one-quarter cents per pound.
" Sugar above number thirteen, and not above number sixteen,
Dutch standard in color: two and three-quarter cents per pound.
"Sugar above number sixteen, and not above number twenty,
Dutch standard in color: three and one-quarter cents per pound."
The following sections of the Revised Statutes were appended as provisos to the original acts from which the above
articles were taken: -

"SECT. 2914. The standard by which the color and grades of
sugar are to be regulated shall be selected and furnished to the
collectors of such ports of entry as may be necessary, by the Secretary of the Treasury, from time to time, and in such manner as he
may deem expedient.
" SECT. 2915. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, by regulation, prescribe and require that samples from packages of sugar
shall be taken by the proper officers, in such manner as to ascertain
the true quality of such sugar; and the weights of sugar imported
in casks or boxes shall be marked distinctly by the custom-house
weigher, by scoring the figures indelibly on each package."

To the foregoing duties twenty-five per cent was added by
the third section of the act of March 3, 1875.
The plaintiffs claimed that the sugars imported were all
below number 7, Dutch standard in color, and were, therefore,
chargeable, under schedule G, with only a duty of one and
three-quarter cents per pound, with the addition of twenty-five
per cent, under the act of 1875. The defendant, under general
instructions from the Treasury Department, rated them at a
higher grade, and charged a duty of two cents upon some of
them, and two and one-quarter cents upon others, with the addition of the twenty-five per cent, under the act of 1875. His
action was based on the position that the sugars in question
had been colored by artificial means, so as to reduce them, in
appearance, below the grade of the Dutch standard to which
they properly belonged according to the amount of crystallized
sugar which they contained, as shown by chemical test by the
polariscope.
The treasury instructions under which the test was applied
were issued on the 19th of July and the 2d of September,
1879. After premising that it had been decided by the courts
that the term " Dutch standard in color," as used in the statutes, means the color of the sugar obtained by the ordinary
processes of manufacture as practised at the time of the enactment of the law, and that any means used to degrade the color
of sugars during or after the process of manufacture is a fraud
upon the revenue, the instruction of July 19, 1879, declares
that -

" All sugars containing ninety per cent, and not more than

MERRITT V. WELSH.

[Sup. Ct.

ninety-four per cent, of crystallizable sugar, the apparent color
of which is not above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, shall be
classified as above No. 7 and not above No. 10, Dutch standard
in color.
"All sugars containing more than ninety-four per cent of
crystallizable sugar, the apparent color of which is not above
No. 10, Dutch standard in color, shall be classified as above No.
10 and not above No. 13, Dutch standard in color."
As the presence of water in the sugars was found to interfere
with uniform results, the instruction was changed in September, as follows: " All sugars the apparent color of which, as imported, is not
above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, and which contain over
ninety-three per cent, and not over ninety-seven per cent, of
crystallizable sugar in one hundred parts of the dry substance,
shall be classified as No. 7 and not above No. 10, Dutch
standard.
"All sugars the apparent color of which, as imported, is not
above No. 10, Dutch standard in color, and which contain over
ninety-seven per cent of crystallizable sugar in one hundred
parts of the dry substance, shall be classified as above No. 10
and not above No. 13, Dutch standard."
It was shown beyond dispute, on the trial, that, so far as
their color was concerned, the sugars were below No. 7 of the
Dutch standard, - a grade chargeable, by the statute, with
only one and three-quarters cents per pound; but the court
allowed the defendant to prove, if he could, that the color of
the sugars was an artificial color, imparted after the process of
manufacture, or after they became the sugars of commerce.
As no proof was offered to show that they were artificially
colored after the process of manufacture was completed, the
court instructed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for
the difference of duty.
The defendant offered to prove that color was imparted to
the sugars in the course of manufacture, by the use of an extra
quantity of lime (some quantity of which is always used to
neutralize acids) or by the introduction of molasses, and increasing the temperature of the vacuum-pan or boiler; but
this evidence the court held to be incompetent. To narrow

Oct. 1881.]

MERRITT V. WELSH.

the point of difference, he offered to show that coloring matter,
namely, molasses, was introduced into the vacuum-pan or
boiler after the mass had been brought to the state of sugar,
but before its final passage through the coolers and the, centrifugal tubs, -the last process through which it goes ; but this
evidence was also decided to be incompetent.
The position and argument of the defendant may be more
fully shown by the instructions which his counsel asked the
court to give the jury, and which were severally refused.
They were as follows: "1. That if the jury shall find from the evidence that the
true color of the sugar in suit, as ascertained by comparing
them in every respect with the standard selected by the Secretary of the Treasury, and actually used in ascertaining and determining their dutiable character, was not sugar ' not above
number seven Dutch standard in color,' they shall find a
verdict for the defendant.
" 2. That if they shall find from the evidence that on December 22, 1870, and prior thereto, the sugars of commerce
were comprised substantially of crystallized sugar and molasses, and that the color of the different grades of such sugar was
produced by molasses, the highest grades being No. 20, Dutch
standard in color, having no molasses in them, and the lower
grades being 16, 13, 10, and 7, Dutch standard in color, having
molasses in them, each of the lower grades having more molasses than the other, so that the greatest quantity of molasses
was contained in the lowest grades;
"And if the jury shall also find from the evidence that the
sugars in suit were not generally known as the sugars of commerce in December 22, 1870, and prior thereto, and that their
color at the time of importation was not produced by molasses,
but was produced by the introduction of some foreign substance after the sugars were made for the purpose of giving to
them a color darker than their true color;
" And if the jury shall also find from the evidence that the
true color of said sugars is different from their apparent color,
and that the true color of said sugars at the time of their importation was above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, they shall
find a verdict for the defendant.

MERRITT V. WELSH.

[Sup. Ct.

"If the jury shall find that the sugars were colored with
burnt molasses, and were manufactured prior to the time when
the burnt molasses was introduced into the vacuum-pan, and
that the same was so introduced into the pan merely for the
purpose of producing a dark surface-color upon the sugars, so
that the sugars, the true color of which was above No. 7,
Dutch standard in color, appeared to the eye by comparison
with the Dutch standard in color to be sugars not above No. 7,
Dutch standard in color, and shall also find that the true color
of the sugar when it became manufactured was above No. 7,
Dutch standard in color, they shall find a verdict for the
defendant.
" The court ruled there was no evidence to submit to the
jury tending to show that the color was not imparted to the
sugar during the process of manufacture.
"4. If the jury shall find from the evidence that the Dutch
standard consists of sugars in which the color indicates the grade
of the sugar, and shall also find that the color of the samples
in suit does not indicate at all the grades of the sugar, but that
the sugars in suit are in fact of a high grade, say No. 16, as
indicated by the Dutch standard, but have a surface-color of
the lowest grade, say not above No. 7, Dutch standard in
color, which surface color was imparted to it after the crystals of
sugar were found in the vacuum-pan at a time when the boiling
of the sugar was completed, they shall find a verdict for the
defendant.
"5. That the surface or external color of the sugars in suit
was not necessarily the color by which their dutiable character
was to be ascertained, but the true color of the sugars in suit, as
ascertained by comparison with the standard which was in use
by the collector, and was actually used for the purpose of ascertaining the duitable character of the sugars in suit, was the
color to guide him in ascertaining and levying duties upon
them.
"6. That if the jury shall find from the evidence that the
surface or external color of the sugars in suit was produced by
the introduction of a foreign substance at a time subsequent to
the manufacture of sugar, and shall also find from the evidence
that when said foreign substance is removed from the surface

of said sugars, that they have not a color of sugars not above
No. 7, Dutch standard in color, but do have a color of sugars
above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, they shall find a verdict
for defendant.
"The court ruled there was no evidence to submit to the
jury tending to show that the color was not imparted to the
sugar during the process of manufacture.
"7. That for tariff purposes centrifugal sugars are required
to have a color obtained by the process of manufacture, without the introduction of any foreign substance in the process of
manufacture for the purpose only of obtaining a darker color
than that which the sugars would have obtained in the natural
process of manufacture.
"8. That if the jury shall find from the evidence that a foreign substance was introduced into the sugars in suit, during
the process of the manufacture, which made them darker in color
than they would have been but for the introduction of such
foreign substance, and shall also find from the evidence that
but for the introduction of said foreign substance the apparent
color of the sugars in suit would not have been that of sugars
not above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, but would have been
of a higher grade, they shall find a verdict for the defendant.
"9. The jury may examine the samples of the sugars in suit,
and themselves compare them with the sugars of the Dutch
standard; and that if the jury find as a matter of fact that the
sugars in suit are not of the color of any of the colors of the
Dutch standard, they may find as a matter of fact whether
the defendant erred in his classification.
"And that if they find the collector did classify the sugars
in suit according to their true color from the best means in his
control, they may find for the defendant.
"10. Sugar is above No. 7, Dutch standard in color, within
the intent of the statute, if it be above that number when
reduced mechanically to the same fineness and packed in the
same manner as such standard.
"11. Sugars composed of crystals larger than those of the
standards furnished by the Secretary of the Treasury may
properly be reduced to the same fineness as those of such standards, and packed in bottles in the same manner for comparison

[Sup. Ct.

with such standards, in order to determine the color or classification."
It will be perceived that the real question in the case is,
whether (supposing that sugars are not artificially colored for
the purpose of avoiding duties after being manufactured) their
dutiable quality is to be decided by their actual color, graded
by the Dutch standard, or by their saccharine strength as
ascertained by chemical tests. The plaintiffs maintain the
former proposition ; the defendant, the latter.
The test described by the statute is, " Dutch standard in
color." The first question that naturally arises is, if Congress
desires the application of the chemical test, in order to determine the saccharine strength of the sugar, why does not
Congress say so? There are two very distinct and different
modes of distinguishing sugar, - by its color, and by the intrinsic percentage of specific crystalline sugar in the mass. One
is determined by a color standard, the other by a chemical
Which of these did Congress adopt? We think,
standard.
clearly, the former.
Perhaps Congress may have acted under a mistaken idea that
color would always indicate quality. Perhaps, up to the time
that the law was passed, as the processes of manufacture had
been conducted, color was an approximate, or general, indication of quality. Suppose this to be so, does it derogate from
the fact that color was the standard which Congress, with the
lights which it had, saw fit to adopt? Does it not tend to
fortify that fact? If it be found by experience that the standard is a fallacious one, can the executive department supply
the defects of legislation? Congress alone has the authority
to levy duties. Its will alone is to be sought.
It appears very clear, from the evidence, that the Dutch
standard is a color standard only. As applied to the sugars of
the Island of Java, brought to the mother country, it was undoubtedly a very fair standard of the quality of sugar. The
juice of the cane was reduced in open boilers, and the viscous
or molasses matter was expelled by drainage, assisted by percolation of water from a covering of white clay, which improved
the sugar both in quality and color. The sugar-merchants of
Holland adopted a scale of colors from No. 1 to No. 20, which

Oct. 1881.]

MERRITT V. WELSH.

is exhibited in small sqnare bottles, containing sugar of the
different shades of color, from dark up to nearly white. These
bottles were prepared by leading firms of high standing in Holland, and were accepted by the trade as the true standard by
which to estimate the grade of sugars. Other nations adopted
it as a matter of convenience. It was not an infallible test of
quality; because some sugars had a higher color than their
intrinsic charater entitled them to; whilst others had a lower.
Nevertheless, no more convenient standard was at hand; and
if, by the feel, or the taste, or other physical indications, the
merchant had reason to believe that the standard was not a
strictly accurate test of quality in a particular case, he exercised his own judgment as to the price he would give, or take,
for the article.
In process of time new modes of manufacture were adopted:
the vacuum-pan in place of the open boiler, for condensing the
liquor; the centrifugal tube in place of the old inverted cone,
or leech-tub, for expelling the molasses; and animal charcoal,
instead of clayey infiltration, for refining and whitening the
result. The perfection of the refining process as now practised
renders color in raw sugars a matter of little consequence, provided they contain abundance of saccharine matter. The color
standard has come to be a precarious one. Still, if the government chooses to adhere to it, it is bound by it. If Congress,
as it has done, adopt the color standard, it is not for the customs department to adopt a different one. When Congress
chooses to do this, it will be time enough for the customhouse to follow.
As before said, Congress alone has the
power to lay taxes and duties.
Great stress is laid on the charge that sugars are manufactured in dark colors on purpose to evade our duties. Suppose
this is true ; has not a manufacturer a right to make his goods
as he pleases ? If they are less marketable, it is his loss; if
they are not less marketable, who has a right to complain ? If
the duties are affected, there is a plain remedy. Congress can
always adopt such laws and regulations as it may deem expedient for protecting the interests of the government. If, in the
case under consideration, a color standard is insufficient, a different one is ready to hand, - that of the polariscope, or other

MERRITT V. WELSH.

[Sup. Ct.

chemical test. If the quantity of saccharine matter in sugar,
or its state of advancement from the raw state to a condition of
refinement, is desirable as a dutiable standard, let it be so declared by the laws; and then the merchant will know on what
lie has to depend. Uncertainty and ambiguity are the bane
of commerce. Discretion in the custom-house officer should
be limited as strictly as possible. It has been said with much
truth, "Where law ends, tyranny begins."
It is argued that, although the Dutch standard of color is
named in the statute, yet the intent of the law was to adopt
it as a standard of quality ; and if, in consequence of changes
in the mode of manufacture, it ceases to be such, the reason of
the law ought to prevail, and quality ought to be still the test.
And that quality was the object sought is inferred from the
language of sects. 2914 and 2915 of the Revised Statutes.
This reasoning would be very good if the law prescribing
the standard were not explicit in its terms. Whatever may
have been in the minds of individual members of Congress,
the legislative intent is to be sought, first, from the words they
have used. If these are clear, we need go no further ; if they
are obscure or ambiguous, then the intent may have to be
sought out by reference to the context, to previous or concurrent enactments, to the history of the art or trade, to general
history, to anything that will throw light on the meaning of
the obscure or ambiguous terms used. But there is no obscurity or ambiguity here. Two tests for fixing the dutiable grade
of sugars were open to the legislative choice, - that of color and
that of constitution or chemical quality. Congress chose the
former. It is not strange that it did so: the color test had
long been used, and it was well calculated to designate quality
in the old sugars, manufactured in the old way. But in making its election, Congress did not leave any room for doubt as
to its meaning. It used apt terms to express it, terms free
from all ambiguity and obscurity. If the test adopted fails
to effect the desired object, the inconvenience, or loss to the
treasury, need only be temporary: it can be changed at any
moment. And it is better to submit to a temporary inconvenience than to set the laws all afloat by laying down a canon
of construction which leaves the plain words, and seeks to spell

Oct. 1881.]

MERRITT V. WELSH.

out, or guess at, the supposed intent of the legislature, contrary
or supplementary to that which is clearly embodied in the
words it has used.
We see nothing in the sections referred to to change this
plain and simple view of the subject. Sect. 2914 merely directs that the standards to be used by the collectors shall be
furnished by the Secretary of the Treasury. This was to insure certainty and uniformity in the selection of the Dutch
standards. The evidence shows that the Secretary performed
this duty by procuring the standards from the proper parties
at Amsterdam, and furnishing them to the collector. They
were exactly the same, however, as those procured by private
dealers. It cannot be justly contended that this section authorized the Secretary to adopt a different standard from that
prescribed by Congress; to wit, a standard of chemical constitution indicated by a polariscope, instead of a standard of color
indicated by the Dutch glass bottles, carefully sealed, graded,
and numbered. This would be to give to the section an unnatural force, and cause it to overrule the primary section to which
it was a proviso. In like manner, when sect. 2915 authorizes
the Secretary, by regulation, to require that samples from packages of sugar shall be taken in such manner as to ascertain the
true quality of such sugar, there is no indication of an intent
to change the dutiable standard adopted in the purview of
schedule G. Even if it be conceded that the word " quality,"
as here used, has reference to saccharine purity or strength, the
most that can be inferred is, that it was the aim of Congress,
by this clause, to enable the officers to take samples from the
packages in such manner as to secure a knowledge of their
entire contents, in the interior and in every part, as well as on
the surface; in other words, to see that there was no fraud in
making up the packages. It was supposed that the true quality
of an entire package could be ascertained by proper care in
taking out the samples,- by the manner in which they were
taken out. Whether the quality was to be ascertained by any
other test than that of the color is not stated; and, if it was,
there is no indication that a different standard from that of the
Dutch standard of color, prescribed in the principal section,
was to be used in fixing the amount of duty. It may have

MERRITT v. WELSH.

[Sup. Ct.

been the object of sect. 2915 to detect the use of artificial coloring on the surface of the packages, applied after the sugar was
manufactured and after the packages were made up. At all
events, we think that there is nothing in either of these sections
that modifies or qualifies the plainly prescribed standard by
which imported sugars were to be graded and assessed for duty.
We have examined the prior legislation on the subject from
the act of Dec. 24, 1861, c. 2, down to that of Dec. 22, 1870, c. 6,
which is substantially reproduced in the Revised Statutes; but,
without reviewing the laws in detail, it suffices to say that we
find nothing in this legislative history to change or affect our
views. The concession that Congress may have supposed that
the Dutch standard of color would be a sufficient test of quality, answers all that can be deduced from the prior statutes.
If experience shows that Congress acted under a mistaken impression, that does not authorize the Treasury Department, or
the courts, to take the part of legislative guardians, and, by
construction, to make new laws which they imagine Congress
would have made had it been properly informed, but which
Congress itself, on being properly informed, has not, as yet,
seen fit to make. It may be that our tariff of duties is
evaded by giving to sugars, in the process of manufacture, a low
grade of color. If this be so, it is no more than every manufacturer does; namely, so to manufacture his goods as to avoid
the burden of high duties, provided he can do it without injuring their marketability, or injuring it less than the duties
involved. So long as no deception is practised, so long as the
goods are truly invoiced and freely and honestly exposed to
the officers of customs for their examination, no fraud is committed, no penalty is incurred. Heretofore, it has been thought
desirable, in order to make sugars more marketable, to use artificial processes for bleaching them. The percolation of clay
water through the mass was one of the means adopted. The
sprinkling of refined syrups in the form of spray on the sugar
in the centrifugals is another. If the manufacturer uses these
bleaching processes in order to make his sugars more salable,
why may he not omit to do so in order to render them less
dutiable; nay, why may he not employ an extra quantity of
molasses for that purpose? If after the sugars are manufac-

Oct. 1881.]

MERRITT V. WELSH.

tured, especially after being put up in packages, coloring matter is artificially imposed, it might be a different matter. The
sugars would then have a different color from that which belonged to them when manufactured. This might be held to be
a fraud on the revenue. But it is unnecessary to decide this
question in this case.
A better remedy than that of making a forced construction
of the law is in the power of Congress. All that has to be
done is, to change the law so as to reach the goods in their new
form, if it is thought desirable to do so. If the law is found
defective, let it be altered so as to attain the result desired.
The argument that the sugars in question are not "sugars
in the sense of the law, because the standard adopted by the
law for fixing the grade is, as to the sugars in question, defective in its application, is too metaphysical to be of weight in the
consideration of the question. They are sugars of commerce,
and the complaint of the custom-house is, that they are better
sugars than they appear to be.
We think that the decision of the court below was right, and
the judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MATTHEWS, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,dissenting.

It seems not to be denied by the opinion of the majority
of the court, as it was expressly conceded by the court below,
that if an artificial color had been imparted to the sugar after
its manufacture, by which it was made identical in appearance
with the color of the sample of the Dutch standard of a particular number, below that with which it would have been
classified but for such adulteration, the government would have
been entitled to prove the fact, and exact duties according to
the classification of sugar of equal grade in its natural color.
This admission is not gratuitous, but is required upon any
just construction of the law. And yet I cannot perceive what
difference there ought to be if, during the process of manufacture, the same color is artificially produced by foreign matter,
not necessary to the production of the sugar, and introduced for
the express purpose of counterfeiting a color of a lower grade,
VOL. XIV.

MERRITT V. WELSH.

[Sup. Ct.

in order to evade the law and escape the duties imposed by it.
This is precisely what the plaintiff in error offered to prove on
the trial, and what, by the rulings of the court, he was not
permitted to do. In my opinion, this was error, for which the
judgment should be reversed.
The admission that it would be unlawful to produce artificially the color of the Dutch standard, after manufacture, to
disguise the grade of the article, is inconsistent with the proposition that the color of that standard, as a visual impression, is
the sole ground of distinction for rating duties on sugar; and
yet that proposition is the only foundation that supports the
judgment of the court below.
The phrase "No. 7 Dutch standard in color," and other
similar phrases in the act of Congress, were not, in my opinion,
intended to establish mere sensible color as the test for distinguishing the grades of sugar, for the purposes of the act; so
as to embrace every description of sugar that could not, by the
unaided eye, be differentiated in color from the sample. If so,
sugar of the highest grade in other respects might be painted
on the surface of its grains, after its manufacture was complete,
without affecting its nature or quality commercially as sugar,
so as perfectly to imitate an article of inferior strength and
value, whose color had been naturally produced, and thus be
limported at a lower rate of duty than would otherwise be lawful. For if mere color is the sole test to be regarded at the
custom-house, as it may be determined by the eye alone, on
comparison with the color of the standard, the officer has no
right to inquire when or how the color was produced, so that
it does not destroy the commercial character of the article.
If the article is, and continues to be, sugar, and corresponds in
color with the color of the sample used as the standard, it is to
be rated accordingly.
A color imparted to sugar artificially, either during the process of manufacture or after its completion, and which it would
not cofltract by means of any of the processes necessary
merely to the production of sugar, is, in my opinion, not its
natural color, and not the real and true color of the Dutch
standard, however closely it may resemble it, or however impossible it may be, by sight merely, to distinguish it from the

Oct. 1881.]

MERRITT V. WELSH.

color of the sample. It is a mere imitation and counterfeit
of the Dutch standard in color ; for that means, not merely an
abstract color, of a certain hue, but a concrete color inhering
in, and belonging only to, sugar when produced according to
the processes which, in the Dutch standard, result in differences of color, according to differences in the quality of the
sugar itself. Congress, by the use of the phrase in question,
intended to refer to color as resulting from and indicating a
certain quality of sugar, considered in reference to its strength
and corresponding value; and hence used words, not descriptive
of color, in reference to the various hues into which the ray of
light is divided by the differences of refrangibility as it passes
through the prism, and which are represented as primitive
colors to the human eye, and designated by their associated
names. Congress did not mean to scale the duty, as the sugar
might be considered, according to such a standard, light yellow,
yellow, dark yellow, light brown, brown, dark brown, &c. It
meant to divide sugars for purposes of duties, according as they
corresponded with certain samples of other sugars, produced
according to a certain known mode of manufacture and designated in commerce, as well as in the statute, as of the Dutch
standard, and classified by numbers, according to a gradation
of color, resulting from that mode of manufacture, and not
otherwise. So that to correspond with the color designated as
a particular number of the Dutch standard, the sample produced must have to the sight not merely a color so like it
that the eye cannot distinguish between them, but the resemblance must be, in all respects, such that it is manifest that it
is not a mere similarity by reason of imitation, but an identity
of color, because it has resulted from the necessary processes of
the manufacture, and belongs, by necessity of its nature, to the
sugar itself, and not to a foreign ingredient, mixed with it as a
coloring matter. In other words, sugar which is classed as
No. 7, Dutch standard in color, must be sugar of that quality
in other respects, which, in the Dutch standard, has a color
known as No. 7.
For these reasons I feel compelled to dissent from the opinion
of the court.
