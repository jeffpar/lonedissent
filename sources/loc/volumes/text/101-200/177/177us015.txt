THORP v. BONNIFIELD.
Opinion of the Court.

THORP v. BONNIFIELD.
TRANSFERRED FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 153. Argued March 1, 1900. -Decided

March 19, 1900.

When a defendant has, by his own action, reduced the judgment against
him by a voluntary settlement and payment below the amount which is
necessary in order to give this court jurisdiction to review it, the real
matter in dispute is only the balance still remaining due on the judgment,
and the right of review in this court is taken away.
The court, being satisfied that the amount in dispute in this case is less
than the amount required by statute to give it jurisdiction, orders the
writ dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
THE

statement of the case will be found in the opinion of the

court.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case has been transferred from the United States Cir-

cuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under and by
virtue of an act of Congress, (30 St. 728,) providing for such
transfer. The act is set forth in the margin.'
'That all cases, civil and criminal, filed on appeal from the District Court
of the United States for the District of Alaska, in the Uhited States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, and pending on appeal therein, on and prior to the thirtieth day of December, 1897, of which
the Supreme Court of the United States would have had jurisdiction under
the then existing law, if a proper appeal had been taken thereto at the
time said cases were filed on appeal in said Circuit Court of Appeals, be,
and the same are, deemed and treated as regularly filed on appeal in the
Supreme Court of the United States as of the date when filed in said Cir-

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

By the terms of this act it is to operate only upon those cases
of which this court would have had jurisdiction under the law
existing at the time the case was taken to the Circuit Court of
Appeals, if a proper appeal had been taken to this court at the
time the case was filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. If
this act be valid therefore, we must inquire whether the case
was one over which this court would have had jurisdiction if a
proper appeal had been taken.
The case was commenced in the United States District Court
for the District of Alaska in April, 1895, for the purpose of
recovering moneys alleged to be due under the terms of a contract for the leasing of certain mining properties, situated ifn
that district. The plaintiffs (defendants in error) demanded
judgment for $7231.25, besides costs of the action. The defendant (plaintiff in error) demurred to the complaint on the
ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action. The demurrer was overruled and leave given
to answer, which the defendant failed to do within the time
granted, and judgment was entered by default for the amount
claimed in the complaint, with costs.
The defendant then moved to vacate and set aside the judgment, and that motion was denied, and he sued out a writ of
error from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. The defendants in error moved to dismiss the
writ on the ground that the Circuit 'Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction.
The Circuit Court of Appeals certified the question to this
court for the purpose of receiving its instruction upon the ques_tion of jurisdiction. This court answered the question in the
negative, denying the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Apcuit Court of Appeals.

The clerk of said' Circuit Court of Appeals is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of the United States, as soon as
practicable, the records of such cases, and the clerk of said Supreme Court
is directed to receive and file the same for hearing and determination in
the Supreme Court of the United States when regularly reached on the
docket, subject to any rules made or to be made by said court which may
be applicable.
Approved July 8, 1898.

Opinion of the Court.

peals. 168 U. S. 703. The mandate from this court was duly
issued, and the Circuit Court of Appeals in conformity therewith
dismissed the writ of error, and on January 4, 1898, it issued its
mandate to that effect, directed to the District Court of the
United States for the District of Alaska, which was filed in the
office of the clerk of that court on February 3, 1898, and in
obedience to that mandate the writ of error was duly dismissed
by the District Court.
On March 29, 1898, an execution upon the original judgment
was issued from the District Court, directed to the United States
marshal of the district, under which certain property of the defendant was sold and a return made. by the marshal to the court,
and on June 14, 1898, ihe sale was duly confirmed by the District Court.
It thus appears that nearly a month before the passage of the
act of July 8, 1898, (supra,) the judgment of the District Court
of Alaska had been carried into effect, an execution issued, the
property sold, a report made of the sale to the court, and that
sale confirmed.
The defendants in error made a motion in this court to dismiss
the writ for want of jurisdiction. That motion was postponed,
by the court until the hearing of the case upon its merits, and
upon the argument thereof the motion to dismiss was renewed
upon the ground (among others) that the act of Congress, if
applicable to cases such as this, was unconstitutional and void.
A further ground for dismissal was set up because, as alleged,
it appeared from the record that the amount in dispute between
the parties was less than the sum necessary to give jurisdiction
to this court. This ground necessitates the statement of a few
additional facts, and if it be well founded, it relieves us from a
discussion of the constitutional question.
After the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiffs' complaint had been overruled and leave given to answer, and the
defendant made default, judgment was entered for the amount
of the plaintiffs' claim. This was on January 25, 1896. By the
complaint it appears that under the lease of the mine by the
plaintiffs to the defendant Thorp, the latter agreed to mine, work
and operate the premises, and after making certain payments,

etc., he was to retain for himself seven-sixteenths of the profits
or net proceeds arising from the operation of the mine, and was
to pay to the plaintiffs the remaining nine-sixteenths in the proportion of seven-sixteenths to the plaintiff Bonnif~qld and twosixteenths to the plaintiff Held.
Immediately after the entry of the judgment it appears by
the affidavits in the case, presented for the purpose of setting
the judgment aside, that the defendant and the plaintiff Bonnifield entered into negotiations in regard to the judgment, and
Bonnifield became satisfied that it had been entered for more
than was equitably due from the defendant, and accordingly
upon the payment of a certain sum to him (much less than by
the face of the judgment appeared to be due him) Bonnifield
"made a complete settlement of all his matters and differences
wiith the defendant, and received a full and complete settle.
ment and satisfaction for his interest in the judgment obtained
in the case," and Bonnifield thereupon "exeduted a satisfaction
of all his right, title and claim in and to said judgment, to wit,
seven-eights thereof." This satisfaction was given the defendant on the 28th of January, who filed the same in the clerk's
office on the 10th day of February, 1896. After he had filed the
satisfaction, and on the same day, the defendant filed his petition
for a writ of error to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit.
The judgment in the case continued to stand on the face of
the record at its original sum, $7231.25 recovery, and $33.55
costs. By the defendant's voluntary settlement with and payment to Bonnifield, one of the plaintiffs, the balance remaining
unpaid was less than the amount necessary to give this court
jurisdiction.
The plaintiff in error cites various cases to maintain the proposition that when the defendant in the case below brings it here
for review the amount of the judgment or decree against him
govrns our jurisdiction, and, as in this case, the judgment is
for more than seven thousand dollars, he maintains that this
court has jurisdiction notwithstanding the payment and settlement above mentioned.
But those cases have no application when the defendant by his

Opinion of'the Court.

own action has reduced the judgment by a voluntary settlement
and payment below the amount which is necessary in order to
give this court jurisdiction to review it. The real matter in dispute is in such case the balance still remaining due on the judgment. Otherwise he might voluntarily settle the controversy
and pay the whole judgment, and then seek to review it. In this
case it appears there was a "full, final and complete settlement
of all matters and tlifferences" between the defendant and plaintiff Bonnifield, and the latter then executed "a full and complete
satisfaction of all his rights, title and claim in and to said judgment." And this was procured by the defendant's own voluntary act. Clearly there was no matter in dispute relative to
that judgment after such voluntary settlement and payment
beyond the sum remaining due thereon. Thus an event has
intervened subsequently to the entry of the judgment, and one
which owes its existence to the act of the defendant himself,
which has taken away his right of review in this court. It is a
compromise or settlement, pro tanto, between the parties; or it
is like a case where, pending a suit concerning the validity of
the assessment of a tax, the tax is paid; or the amount of the
tax has been tendered and deposited in a bank which by statute had the same effect as actual payment and receipt of the
money. Dakota County v. Glidden, 113 U. S. 222; Little v.
Bowers, 134 U. S. 547 ; Cabfornia v. Railroad Conpany, 149
U. S. 308. In such cases the writs of error will be dismissed.
The facts as to the settlement and payment appear here in
the record, although they may be shown by other evidence, as
the above cases hold.
It is uro'ed that the plaintiff Bonnifield had no right under
the circumstances to make the settlement and to satisfy the
judgment to the extent which he did. But this does not answer the objection. As matter of fact he and the defendant
had a full settlement, and he did satisfy the judgment at the
request of the latter, and both defendants in error now join in
a motion to dismiss, predicated upon that settlement and payment, and they both thus ratify the same and acknowledge its
sufficiency. The plaintiff in"error is in no position to deny the
validity of the settlement and payment made at his own re-

quest and by himself, when its sufficiency is acknowledged by
the other parties.
Being satisfied that the amount in dispute in this case is less
than the amount required by statute to give us jurisdiction, and
without expressing any opinion upon the other ground for the
motion,
1"he 'writ must be dismissed for the want of jurisdiction,and
it is so ordered.

QUACKENBUSH1 v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No.145.

Argued February 1,1900.-Decided March 19, 1900.

The act of February 16, 1897, c. 235, for the relief of Commander Quackenbush enacted "1that the provisions of law regulating appointments in the
Navy by promotion in the line, and limiting the number of commanders
to be appointed in the United States naval service, are hereby suspended
for the purpose of this act only, and only so far as they affect John N.
Quackenbush; and the President of the United States is hereby authorized, in the exercise of his discretion and judgment, to nominate and, by
and with the advice and consent of tile Senate, to appoint said John N.
Quackenbush, late a commander in the Navy'of the United States, to the
same grade and rank of commander in the United States Navy as of the
date of August first, eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and to place him
on the retired list of the Navy, as of the date of June first, eighteen hundred and ninety-five: Provided, That he shall receive no pay or emoluments except from the date of such reappointment." Held,
(1) That its only apparent office was to forbidt the allowance of pay or
emoluments from August 1, 1883, by limiting such allowance to
the date of the reappointment, which, in that view, must be regarded as the date of appointment under the act;
(2) That it was remedial in its character, and should be construed as ratifying prior payments which the Government in its counter-claim
was seeking to recover back.

THIS was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims
dismissing the petition of claimant and the counter-claim of defendants in the above entitled cause. 33 C. Cl. 355. The peti.
