DAGGS v. PllENIX NATIONAL BANK.
Statement of the Case.

DAGGS v. PHfENIX NATIONAL BANK.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF ARIZONA.
No. 138.

Submitted January 30, 1900. - Decided April 30, 1900.

In the provision in Rev. Stat. § 5197 that when no rate of interest "is fixed
by the laws of the State, or Territory, or District " in which a bank is
situated it "may take, receive, reserve or charge a rate not exceeding
seven per cent," the words "fixed by the laws" must be construed to
mean ''allowed by the laws."

THIS cause embraces three suits brought by the Phoenix National Bank against A. J. and R. E. Daggs, defendants in error.
They were respectively numbered 2554, 2555 and 2556, and
were consolidated by stipulations of the parties.
They were brought to recover on three promissory notes, aggregating the sum of $9741.73, signed by A. J. Daggs, one of
the appellants. Each note was dated November 1, 1894, and
payable on or before one year from date, with interest at the
rate of ten per cent per annum. Also, to foreclose certain
mortgages executed to secure the notes-one executed by R. E.
Daggs on the 28th of November, 1894, on certain real estate in
Maricopa County, Arizona, and on four water rights of. the Consolidated Canal Company, represented by certificates; two executed by A. J. Daggs on same day, on certain other real estate
situate in the same county.
The answers were substantially the same in all of the cases.
They admitted the making of the notes and mortgages, but
alleged that the interest charge was usurious, and in violation
of sections 5197 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States.
As a counter-claim it was alleged that the plaintiff (appellee)
was indebted to the defendant (appellant) upon a certain promissory note, executed by W. A. Daggs and P. P. Daggs, as copartners and as individuals, and delivered to Thomas Armstrong, Jr., and assigned by him to the plaintiff in blank, and
by the latter, on the 28th of November, 1894, for a valuable

consideration, to the defendant, A. J. Daggs, at which time the
makers were, and ever since have been, notoriously insolvent,
all of which the plaintiff knew.
The note was as follows, marked "Exhibit A," and made
part of the counter.claim:
"No. 1340.

Due Sept. 1st.

"$5000.00.
PH ENIX, ARIZONA, July 18t, 1893.
"On the 1st day of September, 1893, without grace, we or
either of us, for value received, promise to pay to Thos. Armstrong, Jr., at the Phoenix National Bank, at their office in
Phoenix, Arizona, five thousand dollars ($5000) in United States
gold coin, with interest at the rate of 1 and J per cent per
month, until paid. In case of legal proceedings hereon, we or
either of us agree to pay 10 per cent of amount due'hereon as
attorney's fees.
"W. A. and P. P. DAGGS.
"Secured by chattel mortgage of even date herewith.

"W. A. DAGGS.
"P. P. DAGGS."
It was also alleged that no part of the note was paid, and
that there was due thereon the sum of $7076.91. And judgment was prayed for the amount and interest.
For another defence, it was alleged that at the time of the
execution of the three promissory notes sued on, the plaintiff
(appellee) and the defendant, A. J. Daggs, entered into a contract in writing (a copy of which is attached to the 'answer,
marked "Exhibit B") wherein the plaintiff as part of the consideration for the said three notes, sold and assigned and expressly stipulated that the three notes should be received in payment for all its rights, title and interest in and to that certain
right in action, wherein Hugh McCrum was plaintiff and W. A.
and P. A. Daggs were defendants, and plaintiff was intervenor,
over that certain five thousand dollar note marked "Exhibit A"
herein, and the mortgage securing the same.
That at said time the makers of said note were actually insolvent, which plaintiff knew, and it was agreed that plaintiff

should carry on the said litigation in its name until the cause
of action should be determil.d and settled, and pay all costs
accruing prior to N~ovember 1, 1894, and the defendant to pay
those accruing thereai-,,. And it was alleged that the defendant paid out large sums of money in the prosecution of said
suit, to wit, $45.65, as trascript fee from the court below, and
$500 as costs, and expended work and labor of the reasonable
value of $500, and has performed all the conditions of said contract, but that plaintiff (appellant) has failed to perform the
conditions on its part to the damage of defendant in the sum
$10,122.55.
For another defence, it was alleged that the defendant pledged
certain water stock in the Tempe Irrigating Canal as security
for said promissory notes, which was reasonably worth $4000,
and that the plaintiff (appellee) has converted it to its own use,
to defendant's damage in the sum of $4000, wherefore defendant prayed that he be relieved from the payment of interest on
said notes, for his expenditures in said suit; the amount of said
five thousand dollar note for four thousand dollars value of the
water stock pledged, and for two thousand dollars damages.
In case No. 2555 the defendants filed a plea in abatement on
account of the pendency of case No. 2554, and a like plea in
case No. 2556. The pleas were overruled.
And in case iNo. 2555 A. J. Daggs moved for judgment upon
his counter-claim on the ground that it was confessed, because
no reply was made to it.
*Asimilar motion was made in case No. 2556.
Testimony was taken and judgment was entered for the
plaintiff, the Phoenix National Bank, against the defendant,
A. J. Daggs, for the principal of the three notes and interest,
and decreeing a foreclosure of the mortgages and the sale of
the property mortgaged. A motion for a new trial was made
and denied. On writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
Territory the judgment was affirmed, (53 P. 201,) and an appeal was then taken to this court.
In passing on the case the Supreme Court of the Territory.
said:

omission of counsel to comply with the statute and the rules
of this court on the subject of assignments of error.
"These are imperative and must be observed. It is not our
business to search the record if perchance we may find reversible error. It is our duty to examine into such alleged errors
and only such as are distinctly pointed out in the record. The
assignments made by plaintiffs in error in their brief are, for
the most part, so general in character and so wanting in definiteness that they cannot be considered. Although defective
as assignments, we have, by liberal construction, found that
two of them present questions for our review.
"The first of these reads as follows:
"'The court erred in not giving judgment for plaintiffs in
error on their pleas in bar of the recovery of any interest for
the reason that the contract with the national bank for ten per
cent interest is ultra vires.'
"The second assignment of error made by plaintiffs in error,
reads: 'The court erred in overruling the plaintiffs in error
motion for judgment on the pleadings for the reason that there
was no reply to plaintiffs in error verified counter-claim.'"
No statement of facts in the nature or a special verdict being
certified with the record, the plaintiffs in error moved for and
obtained from this court a certiorari to supply the defect, and
in response thereto a statement of facts, which had been made
by the Supreme Court of the Territory was certified to this
court, in which was recited Act No. 71 of the Territory, regulating appeals and writs of error to the Supreme Court, the
judgment of foreclosure and sale, the assignments of error of
appellants, and concluded as follows:
"Under the assignments of error thus made and presented
in the record this court could and did make no determination
of the facts of the case, except such as appeared in the pleadings and judgment, for the reason that such of the assignments
as were sufficient in form to raise any question presented none
for our consideration which necessitated the further finding of
facts in the case. We are unable to determine from the record
presented in this court, in the absence of a bill of exceptions

Plaintiffs in error submitted with the motion a statement

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

.Mr.A. J. Daggs for appellants.

Mr. Aldis B. Browne and Jfr. Alexcnder Britton for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE M KENNA, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

We are confined by the record to the points passed on by the
Supreme Court of the Territory, to wit, the defence of usury,
and -the motion for judgment on the counter-claim.
(1.) By section 5197 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States a national bank may charge on-any note interest at the
rate allowed by the laws of the State or Territory where it is
situated. It is further provided, however, that if no rate is fixed
by such laws the bank may not charge a greater rate than 7 per
cent, and if a greater rate be knowingly charged, the entire
interest agreed tobe paid shall be forfeited. (See. 5198.)
The laws of the Territory are as follows:
"2161. SEC. 1. When there is no express agreement fixing a
different rate of interest, interest shall be allowed at the rate of
seven per cent per annum on all moneys after they become due
on any bond, bill, pronlissory note or other instrument in writing,
or any judgment recovered in any court in this Territory, for
money lent, for money due on any settlement of accounts from
the day on which the balance is ascertained and for money received for the use of another."
"2162. SEc. 2. Parties may agree in writing for the payment
of any rate of interest whatever on money due or to become due
on any contract; any judgment rendered on such contract shall
conform thereto, and shall bear the rate of interest agreed upon
by the parties, and whch shall be specified in the judgment."
The contention of appellant is that the rate of interest is not
fixed by the laws of the Territory. It permits the parties to do
so, but does not do so itself. In other words, it is urged that
the rate is fixed by permission of the laws, and not by the laws,
and upon this distinction a power which every person and every
bank in the Territory has, it is contended, the national banks
do not have.

DAGGS v. PH(ENIX NATIONAL BANK.
Opinion of the Court.

We cannot accept this as a correct interpretation of either
the spirit or the words of the national banking act. By that
act, certainly no discrimination was intended against national
banks, and that the interpretation contended for would seriously
embarrass their business is manifest.
We said in T'ffany v. National Bank of Missouri, 18 Wall.
409, that national banks "were established for the purpose, in
part, of providing a currency for the whole country, and in part
to create a market for the loans of the general government.
It could not have been intended, therefore, to expose them to
the hazard of unfriendly legislation by the States, or to ruinous
competition with state banks."
The language of the Revised Statutes is that national banks
"may take, receive, reserve and charge on any loan
upon any note . . . interest allowed by the laws of the
State, Territory or district" where located, " and no more, except that where by the laws of any State a different rate is
limited for banks of issue organized under state laws, the rate
so limited shall be allowed for associations organized or existing
in any such State under this title." The italics are ours.
The meaning of these provisions is unmistakable. A national
bank may charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of
the State or Territory where it is located; and equality is carefully secured ,with local banks.
The clear meaning and purpose of these provisions remove
the ambiguity of those which follow, if there is any ambiguity.
"Where no rate is fixed by the laws of the State or Territory
or district, the bank may take, secure, reserve or charge a rate
not exceeding seven per centum. . . " " Fixed by the laws"
must be construed to mean "allowed by te laws," not a rate
expressed in the laws. In instances it might be that, but not
necessarily. The intention of the national law is to adopt the
state law, and permit to national banks what the state law
allows to its citizens and to the banks organized by it., Tiffany
v. National Bank of iilissouri, supra.
It is urged, however that National Bank v. Johnson, 104
U. S.271, is in conflict with these views.
In that 'case the defendant, a national bank doing business in

the State of New York, discounted for the plaintiff in the case,
at the rate of twelve per cent per annum, commercial paper
and promissory notes, amounting to $158,003. The interest
whibh the bank knowingly charged amounted to $6564.88, an
excess of $2735.36 beyond the rate allowed by the general laws
of the State. Judgment was rendered for twice the amount of
the interest, which was affirmed by this court upon the statute
of the State, which established the rate of interest for the loan
or forbearance of money at seven per cent.
Meeting the arguments of counsel upon a supposed difference
between loans and discounts, and usurious and non-usurious contracts under the laws of the State in the transactions of natural
persons, the learned justice, who delivered the opinion of the
court, made some remarks whidh seemed to imply that a rate
allowed by a state law was not a rate fixed by a state law. The
remarks, however, were not necessary to the decision, and cannot be considered as expressing the judgment of the court.
(2.) The counter-claims of plaintiffs in error present these
facts:
Theimaking of thefive thousand dollar noteby W. A. and P. P.
Daggs, and its delivery to Thomas Armstrong, Jr. ; its assignment by the latter to'the Phoenix National Bank, (appellee,)
and by the bank, in writing, for a valuable consideration to the
defendant, A. J. Daggs (one of the appellants); the insolvency
of the makers, W. A. and P. P. Daggs, and the non-payment of
the note or any part of it.
To the counter-claim there was a demurrer for insufficiency,
and a denial of each and every one of its allegations. The denial
was not verified. The Supreme Court of the Territory, considering an error assigned on the overruling of appellants' motion
for judgment on the counter-claim, held it insufficient because
it did not allege that due diligence to collect the note had been
exercised, as required by the statute of the Territory, or that
any effort had been made to collect the same.
By this ruling it is urged that the court assumed that the
counter-claim was based on the rights of a surety instead of
upon the direct obligation of the Phoenix Bank, as assignor of
the Armstrong note on account of Armstrong's insolvency.
Articles 122, 1226 and 788 of the Arizona Statutes.

DAGGS v. PH(ENIX NATIONAL BANK.
Opinion of the Court.

Assuming without deciding that appellants are correct in their
construction of the Arizona statutes, and assuming that the answer to the counter-claim did not put in issue the making of
the Armstrong note, and its assignment to plaintiff in error,
nevertheless the answer to the counter-claim did put in issue
the other facts alleged, to wit, the insolvency of the makers of
the note and its non-payment.
But it is said that the contract marked "Exhibit B" shows
the insolvency. It certainly does not. It recites the transfer
of the Armstrong note to A. J. Daggs, and that it is secured
by a mortgage on 3500 sheep; that the note is in litigation
between the Phoenix Bank and Ifugh McCrum of San Francisco
as assignee of D. A. Abrams as assignee of the Bank of Tempe,
"to establish and determine the priorities of rights under mortgages between said litigants hereinbefore mentioned, which said
cause of action and rights of the Phoenix National Bank, under
its first mortgage in said litigation described, is also hereby sold,
assigned, transferred and set over unto A. J.Daggs for the
above nine thousand seven hundred and forty-one and -% dollars ($9741.73). It is further agreed that the aforesaid cause of
action described shall be continued in the name of the Phoenix
National Bank until the said case is determined and settled; but
it is further agreed that from this date, November 1, 1894, A. J.
Daggs shall pay the costs that shall hereafter accrue in the
said case."
This contract standing alone establishes nothing definite, and
appreciating this the appellants attempt to explain it by a resort
to what they allege to be the testimony in the case. It is said
that "they (W. A. and P. P. Daggs) could not pay their notes,
three suits in court foreclosing three mortgages, each seeking
priority, hanging to them like mill stones, grinding them to dust.
Appellee had lost its reputed first mortgage in the district court
and appealed. It. then sold this note and litigation ; the contract shows, and agreed to stand up and carry the suit on in its
name. The case was tried in the Supreme Court of Arizona,
and held adversely to the appellee in appellants' suit against the
makers of the five thousand dollar note. The appellee then fell
down and rof used to let its name. be used any farther to carry on

Syllabus.

the suit, refused to sign the bond, and would have nothing more
to do with the suit.

.

.

.

Appellant then demanded pay-

ment of the five thousand dollar note, and was refused. Appellant spent over $500 in money and $500 in services prosecuting
the makers of the $5000 note; followed it to the Supreme
Court of Arizona, and would have gone further, but appellee
refused to let its name be used and he was compelled to stop.
Appellant then demanded credit for the $5000 note."
Those facts, however, are not a part of the counter-claim and
it is hardly necessary to say cannot be considered in passing on
a motion for judgment based on a confession of the allegations
of the counter-claim.
Nor can it be said that such facts should have been found by
the lower court, because, as we have seen, under the statement
of the case as considered by that court, the questions for decision was the sufficiency of the averments of the c.ounter-claimn
as a defence.
We repeat, therefore, that we are confined to the propositions
we have stated above and discussed, and as there was no prejudicial error in the ruling of the Supreme Court of the Territory on them, its judgment is
Ajflhred.
