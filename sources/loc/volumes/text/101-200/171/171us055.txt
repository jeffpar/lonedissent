APPEALS FOR THE

May 23, 1898.

To the first question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals, viz.: "1. May
any of the lines of a junior lode location be laid within, upon or across
the surface of a valid senior location for the purpose of defining for or
securing to such junior location under-ground or extralateral rights not
in conflict with any rights of the senior location ?" this court returns an
affirmative answer, subject to the qualification that no forcible entry is
made.

OCTOBER TERM, 189M'
Syllabus.
It passes the second question, viz.: "2. Does the patent of the Last Chance
Lode mining claim, which first describes the rectangular claim by metes
and bounds aid then excepts'and excludes them from the premises previously granted to the New York Lode mining claim, convey to the patentee
anything more than he would take by a grant specifically describing only
the two irregular tracts which constitute the granted -surface of the Last
Chance claim ?" because it needs no other answer than that which is
contained in the discussion of the first question in its opinion.
To the third question, viz.: "3. Is the easterly side of the New York Lode
mining claim and ' end line' of the Last Chance Lode mining claim
within the meaning of sections 2320 and 2322 of the Revised Statutes of
the United States ?" it'gives a negative answer.
The fourth question, viz.: "4. If the apex of a vein crosses one end line
and one side line of a lode mining claim, as located thereon, can the locator
of such vein follow it upon its dip beyond the vertical side line of his
location ?" it-answers in the affirmative.
It holds that the fifth question, viz. : " 5. On the facts piesented by the
record herein has the appellee the right to follow its vein downward
beyond its west side line and under the surface of the premises of appellant ?" in effect seeks from this court a decision of the whole case, and
therefore is not one which it is called upon to answer.
In discussing the first of these questions the court holds:
(1) That it is dealing with statutory rights, and may not go beyond
the terms of the statutes;
(2) That as Congress has prescribed the conditions upon which extralateral rights may be acquired, a pa.rty must bring himself within
those conditions, or else be content with simply the mineral beneath the surface of his own territory;
(3) That the Government d6es not grant the right to search for minerals in lands which are the private property of individuals, or authorize any disturbance of the title or possession of such lands;
(4) That the location of a mining claim means the giving notice of that
claim: that it need not follow the lines of Government.surveys:
that it is made to measure rights beneath the surface: and that
although the statute requires it to be distinctly marked on the
surface, the doing so does not prevent a subsequent location by
another party upon the same, or a part of the same territory, as,
in such case, the statute provides a way for determining the respective righfts of the parties:
(5) That the requisition in the statute that the end lines of the location
should be parallel was for the purpose of bounding the underground extralateral rights which the owner of the location might
exercise.
(6) That the answer to the first question ddes not involve a decision as
to the full extent of the righis beneath the surface which the
junior locator, acquires.
In discussing the fourth of these propositions the court says: " Our conclu-

Statement of the Case.
sions may be summed up in these propositions: First, the location as
made on the surface by the locator determines the extent of rights below
the surface. Second, the end lines, as he marks them on the surface,
with the single exception hereinafter noticed, place the limits beyond
which he may not go in the appropriation of any vein - or veins along
their course or strike. Third, every vein I the top or apex of which lies
inside of such 'surface lines extended downward vertically' becomes his
by virtue of his location, and he may pursue it to any depth beyond his
vertical side lines, although in so doing he enters beneath the surface
of some other proprietor. Fourth,the only exception to the -rule that
the end lines of the location as the locator places them establish the
limits beyond which he .may not go in the appropriation of 4 vein bn its
course or strike Is where it is developed that in fact the location has
been placed.not along but across the course of the vein. In such case
the law declares that those which the locator called his side lines are
his end lines, and those which he called end lines are in fact side lines,
and this upon the proposition that it was the intent of Congress to give
to the locator only so many feet of the length of the vein, that length to
be bounded by the lines which the locator has established of his location.

THIS case is before this court on questions certified by the
Court of Appeals for the-Eighth Circuit. The facts stated
are as follows: The appellant is the owner in fee of the Del
Monte Lode mining claim, located in the Sunnyside mining
district, Mineral County, Colorado, for which it holds a patent
bearing date February 3, 1894, pursuant to an entry made at
the local land office on February 27, 1893. The appellee is
the owner of the Last Chance Lode mining claim, under
patent dated July 5, 1894, based on an entry of March 1,
1894. The New York Lode 1ining claim, which is not
owned by either of the parties, was patented on April 5, 1894,
upon an entry of August 26, 1893. The relative situation of
these claims, as well as the course and dip of the vein, which
is the subject of controversy, is shown in the diagram. on
page 58.
Both in location and patent the Del Monte claim is first
in time, the New York second and the Last Chance third.
When the owners of the Last Chance claim applied for their
patent proceedings in adverse were institutgd against them
by the owners of the New York claim, and an action in support of such adverse was brought in the United States Circuit
Court for the District of Colorado. This action terminated

in favor of the owners of the New York and against the
owners of the Last Chance, and awarded the territory in conflict between the two locations to the New York claim. The
ground in conflict between the New York and Del Monte,
except so much thereof as was also ih conflict between the

Del .Monte and Last Chance locations, is included in the
patent to the Del Monte claim. The New York secured a
patent to all its territory, except that in conflict with the Del
.Monte, and the Last Chance in, turn secured a patent to all
of its territory, except that in conflict with the New York,
in which last-named patent was included the triangular sur-

Statement of the Case.

face conflict between the Del Monte and Last Chance, which,
by agreement, was patented to the latter. The Last Chance
claim was located upon a vein, lode or ledge of silver and
lead bearing ore, which crosses its north end -line and continues southerly from that point through the Last Chance
location until it reaches the eastern side line of the New
York, into which latter territory it enters, continuing thence
southerly with a southeasterly course on the New York claim
until it crosses its south end line. No part of the apex of the
vein is embraced within the small triangular parcel of ground
in the southwest corner of the Last Chance location which was
patented to the Last Chance as aforesaid, and no pait of the
apex is within the surface boundaries of the Del Monte-mining claim. The portion .of the vein in controversy is that
lying under the surface of the Del Monte claim and between
two vertical planes, one drawn through the north end line of
the Last Chance claim extending westerly, and the other parallel thereto and starting at the point where the vein leaves
the Last Chance and enters the New York claim, as shown on
the foregoing diagram. Upon these facts the following questions have been certified to us:
"1. May any of the lines of a junior lode location be laid
within, upon or across the .surface of a valid senior location
for the purpose of defining for' or securing to such junior location under-ground or extralateral rights not in conflict with
any rights of the senior location?
"2. Does the patent of the Last Chance Lode mining
claim, which first describes the rectangular claim by metes
and bounds and then excepts and excludes therefrom the
premises previously granted to the New York Lode mining
claim; convey to the patentee anything more than he would
take by a grant specifically describing only the two irregular
tracts which constitute the granted surface of the Last
Chapce claim?
"3. Is the easterly side of the New York Lode miningr
claim an 'end line' of the Last Chance Lode mining claim

MR.

JUSTICE BREWER,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
. The questions thus presented are not only important but
difficult, involving as they do the construction of the statutes
of the United States in respect to mining claims. As leading
up to a clearer understanding of those statutes it may be well
to notice the law in existence prior thereto. The general rule
of the common law was that whoever had the fee of the soil
owned all below the surface, and this common. law is the
general law of the States and Territories of the United States,
and-, in the absence of specific statutory provisions or contracts, the simple inquiry as to the extent of mining rights
would be, who owns the surface. Unquestionably at common
law the owner of the soil might convey his interest in mineral
beneath the surface without relinquishing his title to the surface, but the possible fact of a separation between the ownership of the surface and the ownership of mines beneath that
surface, growing out of contract, in no manner abridged the
general proposition that the owner of the surface owned all
beneath. It is said by Lindley, in his work on Mines, (vol. 1,
sec. 4,) that in certain parts of England and Wales so called

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE-MIN. CO. 61
Opinion of the Court...

local customs were recognized which modified the general
rule of the common law, but the existence of such exceptions
founded upon such local customs only accentuates the general rule. The Spanish and Mexican mining law confined
the owner of amine to perpendicular lines on every side.
.Mining Company v. Tarbet, 98 U. S. 463, 468; 1 Lindley on
Mines, sec. 13. The peculiarities of the Mexican law are discussed by Lindley at some length in the section referred to.
It is enough here to notice the fact that by the Mexican as by
the common law the surface rights limited the rights below
the surface.
In the acquisition of foreign territory since the establishment of this government the great body of the land acquired
became the property of the United States, and is known as
their "public lands." By virtue of this ownership of the soil
the title to all mines and minerals beneath the surface was
also vested in the Government.- For nearly a century there
was practically no legislation on the part of Congress for the
disposal of mines or mineral lands. The statute of July 26,
1866, c. 262, 14 Stat. 251, was the first general statute providing for the conveyance of mines or minerals. Previous to
that time it is true that there had been legislation respecting
leases of mines, as, for instance, the act of March 3, 1807,
c. 49, Â§ 5, 2 Stat. 448, 449, which authorized the President
to lease any lead mine in the Indiana Territory for a term not
exceeding five years; and acts providing for the sale of lands
containing lead mines in special districts, act of March 3,
1829, c. 55, 4 Stat. 364; act of July 11, 184:6, c. 36, 9 Stat.
37; act of March 1, 1847, c. 32, 9 Stat. 146; act of March
3, 1847, c. 54, 9 Stat. 179; also such legislation as is found
in the act of February 27, 1865, c. 64, 13 Stat. 440, providing
for a District and Circuit Court for the District of Nevada in
which it was said, in section 9: "That no possessory action
between individuals in any of the courts of the United States
for the 'recovery of any mining title, or for damages to any
such title, shall be affected by the fact that the paramount
title to the land on which such mines are, is in the United
States, but each case shall be adjudged'by the law of posses-

sion;" that of May 5, 1866, c. 73, 14 Stat. 43, concerning the
boundaries of the State of Nevada, which provided that "all
possessory rights acquired by citizens of the United States to
mining claims, discovered, located and originally recorded in
compliance with the rules and regulations adopted by miners
in the Pah-Ranagat and other mining districts in the territory
incorporated by the provisions of this act into the State of
Nevada shall remain as valid subsisting mining claims; but
nothing herein contained shall be so construed as granting a
title in fee to any mineral lands held by possessory titles in
the mining States and Territories;" and the act of July 25,
1866, c. 244, 14 Stat. 242, which, .grauting -to A. Sutro and
his assigns certain privileges to aid in the construction of a
tunnel, conferred upon the grantees the right of preenption
of lodes within two thousand feet on each side of sai d tunnel.
Two laws were also passed regulating the sale and disposal
of coal lands; one on July 1, 1864, c. 205, and one on March
"3,1865, c. 07, 13 Stat. 343, 529.
Notwithstanding that there was no general legislation on
the part of Congress, the fact of explorers searching the public domain for mines, and their possessory rights to the mines
by them discovered, was generally recognized, and the rules
and customs of miners in any particular district were enforced
as valid. As said by this court in Sparrow v. Strong, 3 WAIl.
97, 104: "We know, also, that the territorial legislature has
recognized by statute the validity and binding force of the
rules, regulations and customs of the mining districts. And
we cannot shut our eyes to the public history, which informs
us that under this legislation, and not only without interference by the National GoVernment, but under its implied sanction, -vast mining interests have grown up, employing many
millions of capital, and contributing largely to the prosperity
and improvement of the whole country." See also -'orbes v.
Gracey, 94 U. S. 762; Jennison v. Kirk, 98 U. S.453, 459;

Mu/f, 152 U. S. 505, 510;' Black v. Elkhorn Mining ComPany, 163 U. S.445, 449.
The act of 1866 was, however, as we have said, .the first

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. CO. 63
Opinion of the Court.

general legislation in respect to the disposal of mines. The
first section provided: "That the mineral lands of the public
domain, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared
to be free and open to exploration and occupation by all citizens of the United States, and those who have declared their
intention to become citizens, subject to such regulations as
may be prescribed by law, and subject also to the local cus-toms or rules of miners in the several mining districts, so far
as the same may not be in conflict -with the laws of the
United States."
The second section gave to a claimant of a vein or lode of
quartz, or other rock in place, bearing gold, etc., the right
"to file in the local land office a diagram of the same
and to enter such tract and-receive a patent therefor, granting such mine, together with the right to follow such vein or
lode with its dips, angles and variations, to any depth, although
it may enter the land adjoining, which land adjoining shall
be sold subject to this condition."' The purpose here manifested was the conveyance of the vein, and not the conveyance of a certain area. of land within which was a vein.
Section 3,-'which set forth the steps necessary to be taken to
secure a patent and required the payment of five dollars per
acre for the land conveyed, added: "But said plat, survey or
description shall in no case cover more than one vein or lode,
and no patent shall issue for more than one vein or lode,
which shall be expressed in the patent issued." Nowhere
was there any express limitation as to the amount of land to
be conveyed, the provision in section 4 being: "That no location hereafter made shall exceed two hundred feet in length
along the vein for each locator, with an additional claim for
discovery to the discoverer of the lode, with the right to follow such vein to any depth, with all its dips, variations and
angles, together with a reasonable quantity of surface for the
convenient working of the same as fixed by local rules: And
providedofurtker,That no person may make more than one location -on the same lode, and not more than three thousand feet
shall be taken in any one claim by any association of persons."
Obviously the statute contemplated the patenting of a certain

. 61-

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.Opinion of the Court.

number of feet of the parti~ular vein, claimed by the locator,
no matter how irregular its course, made no provision as to
the surface area or the form of the surface location, leaving
the Land Department in each particular case to grant so
-much of the surface as was -,' fixed by local rules," or was in
the absence of such rules in-its judgment necessary for the
convenient working of the mine. The party to whom the
vein was thuts patented was permitted to follow it on its. dip
to any extent, although thereby passing underneath lands to
which the owner of the vein had no title.
As might be expected, the patents issued under this statlute
described surface areas very different and sometimes irregular
in form. Often they were like a broom, there being -around
the discovery shaft an amount of ground deemed large enough
for the convenient working of the mine, and a narrow strip
extending therefrom as the handle of the broom. This strip
might be straight or in a curved or irregular line, following,
as was supposed, fhe course of the vein. Sometimes the surface claimed and patented -was a tract of considerable size, so
claimed with the view of.inuclucing the apex of the vein, in
whateve rdik~ection subsequent explorations- might show it to
run. And again, where there were -local rules giving to the
discoverer of a mine possessory rights in a certain area of sur-face, the patent followed jthose rules and conveyed a similar
area. Even under this-statute, although its express purpose
was primarily to grant the single vein, yet the rights of the
patentee beneath the surface were limited and controlled by
his rights upon the -surface. If, in fact, as shown by subsequent explorations, the vein on its course or strike departed
from the boundary lines of the surface location, the point of
departure Was"the limit of right. In other words, he was not
entitled to the claimed and patented number of feet of the
vein, irrespective of the question whether the vein in its
course departed from the lines of the surface location.
The litigation in respect to the Flagstaff mine in Utah
illustrates this. There was a local custom giving to the
locator of a mine fifty feet in width on either side of the
course of the vein, and the Flagstaff patent granted a super-

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

ficies one hundred feet wide by twenty-six hundred feet long,
with the right to follow the vein described therein to the
extent of twenty six hundred feet. It turned out that the
vein, instead of running through this parallelogram lengthwise, crossed the side lines, so that there was really but a
hundred feet of the length of the vein within the surface area.
On either side of the Flagstaff ground were other locations,
through. which the vein on its course passed. As against
these two locations the owners of the Flagstaff claimed the
right to follow the vein on its course or strike to the full
extent of twenty-six hundred feet. This was denied by the
Supreme Court of Utah. McCormick v. Va'rnes, 2 Utah, 355.
In that case the controversy was with the location on the west
of the Flagstaff. The decision of that court in respect to the
controversy with the location on the- east of the Flagstaff is
not reported, but the case came to this court. Mining Company v. flarbet, 98 U. S. 463. In the course of the opinion
(pages 467, 468) it was said:
"It was not the intent of the law to allow a person to make
his location crosswise of a vein so that the side lines shall
cross it, and thereby give him the right to follow the strike of
the vein outside of his side lines. That would subvert the
whole system sought to be established by the law. If he
does locate his claim in that way, his rights must be subordinated to the rights of those who have properly located on the
lode. Their right to follow the dip outside of their side lines
cannot be interfered with by him. His right to the lode only,
extends to so much of the lode as his claim covers. If he has
located crosswise of the lode, and his claim is only one hundred feet wide,-that one hundred feet is all he has a right to."
These decisions show that while the express purpose of the
statute was to grant the vein for so many fdet along its
course, yet such grant could only be made effective by a surface location covering. the course to such extent. This act of
1866 remained in force only six years, and was then super.
seded by the act of May 10, 1872, c. 152, 17 Stat. 91, found in
the Revised Statutes, sections 2319 and following. This is
the statute which is in force to-day, and under which the conVOL. CLXXI-5

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

troversies in this case arise. Section 2319, Revised Statutes,
(corresponding to section 1 of the act of 1872,) reads:
"All valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the
United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby
declared to be free and open to exploration and purchase, and
the lands in which they ire found to occupation and purchase,
by citizens of the United States and those who have declared
thdir intention to become such, under regulations prescribed
by law, and according to the local customs or rules of miners
in the several mining districts, so far as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the law of the United States."
It needs no argument to show t.hat if this were the only
section bearing upon the question, patents for land containing
mineral would, except in cases affected by local customs and
rules of miners, be subject to the ordinary rules of the common
law, and would convey title to. only such minerals as were
found beneath the surface. We therefore turr to, the following sections to see what extralateral rights are given and upon
what conditions they may be exercised. And it must be
borne in mind in considering the questions presented that we
are dealing simply with statutory rights. There is no showing
of any local customs or rules affecting the rights defined in
and prescribed by the statute, and beyond the teris of the
statute courts may not go. They have no power of legislation. They cannot assume the existence of any natural equity
and rule that by reason of such equity a party may follow a
vein into the territory of his neighbor, and appropriate it to his
own use. If cases arise for which Congress has made no provision, the courts cannot supply the defect. Congress having
prescribed the conditions upon which extralateral rights may
be acquired, a party must bring himself within those conditions or else be content with simply the mineral beneath the
surface of his territory. It is undoubtedly true that the primary thought of the statute is the disposal of the mines and
minerals, and in the-fnterpretation of the statute this primary
purpose must be recognized and given effect. Hence, whenever-a party has acquired the title to ground within whose surface area is the apex of a vein with a few or many feet along

DEL MONTE M]IN. CO. v. LAST OHA NCE MIN. CO.

67

Opinion of the Court.

its course or strike, a right to follow that vein on its dip for
the same length ought to be awarded to him if it can be done,
and only if it can be done, under any fairand natural construction of the language of the statute. If the surface of the
ground wyas everywhere level and veins constantly pursued
a straight line there would be little difficulty in legislation
to provide for all contingencies, but mineral is apt to be
found in mountainous regions where great irregularity of surfade exists and the course or strike of th6 veins is as irregular as the surface, so that many cases may arise- in which
statutory provisions will fail to secure to a discoverer of a vein
such an amount thereof as equitably it would seem he ought
to receive. We make these observations because we find in
some of the opinions assertions by the writers that they have
devised rules which will work out equitable solutions of all
difficulties. Perhaps those rules may have all the virtues
which are claimed for them, and if so it were well if Congress
could be persuaded to enact them into statute; but be that as
it may, the question in the courts is not, what is equity, but
what saith the statute. Thus, for instance, there is no inherent necessity that the end lines of a mining claim should be
parallel, yet the statute has so specifically prescribed. (Sec.
2320.) It is not within the province of the courts to ignore
such provision and hold that a locator, failing to comply
with its terms, has all the rights, extralateral and otherwise,
which he would have been entitled to if he had complied, and
so it has been adjudged. Iron Silver Mining Comqny v.
Egin Mining Company, 118 U. S. 196.
This case, which is often called the "Horseshoe case," on
account of the form of the location, is instructive. The diagram on page 68, which was in the record in that case, illustrates the scope of the decision.
The locator claimed in his application for a patent the lines
1,-14 and 5, 6, as the end. lines of his location, and because of
their parallelism, that he bad complied with the letter of the
statute, but the court ruled against him, saying in the opinion
(page 20S):
'"The exterior lines of the Stone claim formed a- curved

Opinion of the Court.

figure somewhat in the shape of a horseshoe, and its end lines
are not and cannot be made parallel. What are marked on
the plat as end lines are not such. The one between numbers
5 and 6 is a side line. The draughtsman or surveyor seems
to have hit upon two parallel lines of his nine-sided figure,

-SCALE- 200 FEET-l INCH.

and apparently for no other reason than their parallelism
called them end lines.
"We are; the'refore, of opinion 'that the objection that, by
reason of the surface form of the Stone claim, the defendant
could not follow the lode existing therein in its downward
course beyond the lines of the claim, was well taken to the
offered proof."

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIÂ±N. CO.

69

Opinion of the Court.

It is true the court also observed that if the two lines named
by the locator were to be considered the end lines, no part of
the vein in controversy fell "within vertical planes drawn
down through those lines, continued in their own direction."
lBut notwithstanding this observation the point of the decision was that the lines, which were the end lines of the location as made on the surface of the ground, were not parallel,
and that this defect could not be obviated by calling that
which was in fact a side line an end line. This is made
more clear by the observations of the Chief Justice, who,
with Mr. Justice Bradley, dissented, in which he said:
"I cannot agree to this judgment. In my opinion the end
lines of a mining location are to be projected parallel to each
other and crosswise of the general course of the vein within
the surface limits of the location, and whenever the top or
apex of the vein is found within the surface lines extended
vertically downwards, the vein may be followed outside of
the vertical side lines. The end lines are not necessarily
those which are marked on the map as such, but they may
be projected at the extreme points where the apex leaves the
location as marked on the surface."
In other words, the court took the location as made on the
surface by the locator, determined from that what were the
end lines, and made those surface end lines controlling upon
his rights; and rejected the contention that it was proper for
the court to ignore the surface location and create for the
locator a new location whose end lines should be crosswise of
the general course of the vein as finally determined by explorations. .That this decision* and that in the Tai1bet case,
supra, were correct expositions of the statute and correctly
comprehended the intent of Congress therein, is evident from
the fact that, although they were announced in 1885 and 1878,
respectively, Congress has not seen fit to change the language
of the statute, or in any manner to indicate that any different
measure of rights should be awarded to a mining locator.
With these preliminary observations we pass to a consideration of the questions propounded. The first is:
"May any of the lines of a junior lode location be laid

, OCTOBE3R TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

within, upon or across the surface of a valid senior location
for the purpose of defining for or securing to such junior location underground or extralateral rights not in conflict with
any rights of the senior location?"
By section 2319, quoted above, the mineral deposits which

this is true, it is also true that until the legal title has passed

grant is, as is often said, in -process of administration. Passing to section 2320, beyond the rec.ognition of the governing
force of customs and regulations and a declaration as to the
extreme length and width of a mining claim, it is provided
that "no location of a mining claim shall be made until
the discovery of the vein or lode within the limits of the
claim located. . . . The end lines of each claim shall be
parallel to each other.'
Section 2322 gives to. the locators of all mining locations,
so long as they comply with laws of the United States, and
with state, territ6rial and local regulations not in conflict
therewith, "the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment
of all the surface includedj, within the lines of their locations,
and of all veins, lodes and ledges throughout their entire
depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface
lines extended downward vertically, although such veins,
lodes or ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in
their course downward as* to extend outside the vertical side
lines of such surface locations. But their right of possession to
such outside parts of such veins or ledges shall be confined to
such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes drawn
downward as above described, through the end lines of their'
locations, so continued in their owih direction that such planes
will intersect such exterior parts of such veins or ledges. And

of a vein or lode which extends in its downward course beyond the vertical lines of his claim to enter upon the surface
of a claim owned or possessed by another."
Section 2321 in terms authorizes "the miners of each mining district to make regulations not in conflict with the laws
of the United States, or with the laws of the State or Territory in which the district is situated, governing the location,
manner of recording, amount of work necessary t6 hold possession of a mining claim, subject to the followlung requirements: The location must be distinctly marked on the ground
so that its boundaries can be readily traced. All records of
mining claims hereafter made shall contain the name or
names of the locators, the date of the location, and such a
description of the claim or claims located by reference to some
natural object or permanent monument as will identify the
claim. On each claim located after the tenth day of May,
eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and until a patent has
been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars' worth
of labor shall be performed or improvements made during
each year. On all claims located prior to the tenth day of
May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, ten dollars' worth of
labor shall be performed or improvements made by the tenth
day of June, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and each
year thereafter, for each one hundred feet in length along
the vein until a patent has been issued therefor; but where.
such claims are held in combi~on, such expenditure may be
made upon any one claim; and upon a failure to comply with
these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such failure
occurred shall be open to relo6ation in the same manner as
if no location of the same had ever been made, provided that
the original locators, their heirs, assigns or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and
before such location."
Section 2325 provides for the issue of a patent. It reads:

same period. The claimant, at the time of. filing this application, or at any time thereafter, within the sixty days of
publication, shall file with the register a certificate of the
United States surveyor general that five hundred dollars',
worth of labor has been expended or improvements made
upon the claim by himself or grantors; that the plat is correct, with such further description by such reference to natural objects or permanent monuments as shall identify*the
claim, and furnish an accurate description, to be incorporated
in the patent. At the expiration of the sixty days of publication the claimant shall file his affidavit, showing that the plat
and notice have been posted in a conspicuous place on the

no objection from third parties to the issuance of a patent
shall be heard, except it be shown that the applicant has
failed to comply with the terms of this chapter."
Section 2326 is as follows:
"Where an adverse claim is filed during the period of publication it shall be upon oath of the person or persons making
the same, and shall show the nature, boundaries and extent of
such adverse claim, and all proceedings, except the'publication
of notice and making and filing of the affidavit thereof, shall be
stayed until the controversy shall have been settled or decided
by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the adverse claim
waived. It shall be the duty of ihe adverse claimant, within
thirty days after filing his claim, to commence proceedings in a
court of competent jurisdiction to determine the question of
the right of possession, and prosecute the same with reasonable diligence to final judgment; and a failure to do so shall
be a waiver of his adverse claim. After such judgment shall
have, been iendered, the party entitled to the possession of the
claim, or any -portion thereof, may, without giving further
notice, file a certified copy of the judgment roll with the
register of the land office, together with the certificate of the
surveyor general that the requisite amount of labor has been
expended or improvements made thereon, and the description
required in other cases, and shall pay to the receiver five
dollars per acre for his claim, together with the proper fees,
whereupon the whole proceedings and the judgment roll shall
be certified by the register to the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, and a patent shall issue thereon for the claim, or
such portion thereof, as the applicant shall appear, from the
decision of the court, to rightly possess. If it appears from
the decision of the court that several parties are entitled to
separate and different portions of the claim, each party may
pay for his portion of the claim; with the proper fees, and file
the certificate and description by the surveyor general, whereupon the register shall certify the proceedings and judgment
roll to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, as in the
preceding case, and patents shall issue to the several parties
according to their respective rights. Nothing herein con-

tained shall be construed to prevent the alienation of the title
conveyd by a patent for a mining claim to any person whatever.5)
These"-are the only provisions of the statute which bear
upon the question presented.
The stress of the argument in favor of a negative answer to
this question lies in the contention that by the terms of the
statute exclusive possessory rights are granfed to the locator.
Section 2322 declares that the locators "1shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their location," and negatively that
"nothing in this section shall authorize the locator or possessor of a vein or lode which extends in its downward course
beyond the vertical lines of his claim to enter upon the surface
of a claim-owned or possessed by another." Hence, it is said
that affirmatively and negatively it is provided that the locator shall have exclusive possession of the surface, and that
no one shall have a right to disturb him in such possession.
How .then, it is asked, can any one have a right to enter upon
such loation for the purpose of making a second location. If
he does so he is a trespasser, and it cannot be presumed that
Congress intended that any rights should be created by trespass.

We are not disposed to undervalue the force of this argument, and yet are con.trained to hold that it is not controlling.
It must be borne in mind that the location is the initial step
taken by the locator to indicate the place and extent of the
surface which he desires'to acquire. It is a means of giving
notice. That which is located is called in section 2320 and
elsewhere a "claim" or a "mining claim." Indeed, the words
"claim" and "location" are usedt interchangeably. This
location does not come at the end of the proceedings, to define
that which has been acquired after all contests have been adjudicated. The location, the mere making of a claim, works
no injury to one who has acquired prior rights. Some confusion may arise when locations overlap each other and include
the same ground, for then the right of possession becomes a
matter of dispute, but no location creates a right superior

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. CO.

75

Opinion of the Court.

to any previous valid location. And these-possessory rights
have always been recognized and disputes coiicerning them
settled in the courts.
It will also be noticed that the locator is not compelled to
follow the lines of the Government surveys, or -to make his
location in any manner correspond to such surveys. The location may, indeed, antedate the public surveys, but whether
before or after them, the locator places his location where, in
his judgment, it will cover the underlying vein. The law requires that the end lines of the claim shall be parallel. It
will often happen that locations which do not overlap are so
placed as to leave between them some irregular parcel of
ground. Within that, it being no more than one locator is
entitled to take, may be discovered a mineral vein and the
discoverer desire to take the entire surface and yet it be inpossible for him to do so and make his end lines parallel unless,
for the mere purposes of location, he be permitted to place those
end lines on territory already claimed by the prior locators.
Again, the location upon the surface is not made with the
view of getting benefits from the use of that surface. The
purpose is to reach the vein which is hidden in the depths
of the earth, and the location is made to measure rights beneath
the surface. The area of surface is not the matter of moment ;
the thing of value is the hidden mineral below, and each
locator ought to be entitled to make his location so as to reach
as much of the unappropriated, and perhaps only partially
discovered and traced vein, as is possible.
Further, Congress has not prescribed how the location shall
be made. It has simply provided that it "must be distinctly
marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily
traced," leaving the details, the manner of marking, to be
settled by the regulations of each mining district. Whether
such location shall be made by stone posts at the four corners,
or by simply wooden stakes, or how many such posts or stakes
shall be placed along the sides and ends of the location, or
what other matter of detail must be pursued in order to perfect a location, is left to the varying judgments of the mining
districts. Suoh locations, such, markings on the ground, are

OCTOBER TERM. 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

not always made by experienced surveyors. Indeed, as a rule,
it has been and was to be expected that such locations and
markings would be made by the miners themselves - men inexperienced in the matter of surveying, and so in the nature
of things there must frequently be disputes as to whether any
particular location was sufficiently and distinctly marked on
the surface of the ground. Especially is this true in localities
where the ground is wooded or broken. In such localities the
posts, stakes or other particular marks required by the rules
and regulations of the mining district may be placed in and
upon the ground, and yet, owing to the fact that it is densely
wooded, or that it is very broken, such marks may not be perceived by the new locator, and his own location marked on
the ground in ignorance of the existence of any prior claim.
And in all places posts, stakes or other monuments, although
sufficient at first and clearly visible, may be destroyed or removed, and nothing remain to indicate the boundaries of the
prior location. Further, when any valuable vein has been
discovered naturally many locators hurry to seek by early
locations to obtain some part of that vein, or to discover and
appropriate other veins in that vicinity. Experience has
shown that around any new discovery there quickly grows up
what is called a mining camp, and the contiguous territory is
prospected and locations are made in every direction. In the
haste of such locations, the eagerness to get a prior right to
a portion of what is supposed to be a valuable vein, it is not
strange that many conflicting locations are made, and, indeed,
in every mining camp where large discoveries have been made
locations, in fact, overlap each other again and again. McEvoy
v. Hyman, 25-Fed. Rep. 596, 600. This confusion and conflict is something which must have- been expected, foreseen
-something
which inthe nature of things would happen,
and the legislation of Congress must be interpreted in the
light of such foreseen contingencies.
Still again, while a location is r~quired by the statute to be
plainly marked on the surface of the ground, it is also provided
in section 2324 thtt, upon a failure to comply with certain
named conditions, the claim or mine shall be open to reloca-

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

tion. Now, although a locator finds distinctly marked on the
surface a location, it does not necessarily follow therefrom
that the location is still valid and subsisting. On the contrary, the ground may beentirely free for him to make a location upon. The statute does not provide, and it cannot be
contemplated, that he is to wait until by judicial proceedings
it has become established that the prior location is invalid or
has failed before he inav make a location. He ought to be
at liberty-to make his location at once, and thereafter, in
the manner provided in the statute, litigate, if necessary, the
validity of the other as well as that of his own location.
Congress has in terms provided for the settlement of disputes and conflicts, for by section 2325, when a locator makes
application for a patent, (thus seeking to have a final determination by the Land Department of his title,) lie is required
to make publication and give notice so as to enable any one
disputing his claim to the entire ground within his location
to know what he is seeking, and ary party disputing his right
to all or any part of the location may institute adverse proceedings. Then by section 2326 proceedings are to be commenced in some appropriate court, and the decision of that
court determines the relative rights of the parties. And the
party who by that- judgment is shown to be "entitled to t*he
possession of the claim, or any portion thereof," may present
a certified copy of the judgment roll to the proper land officers
and obtain a patent " for the claim, or such portion thereof, as
the applicant shall appear, from the decision of the court, to
rightfully possess." And that the claim may be found to
belong to different persons and that the right of each to a
portion may be adjudicated is shown by a subsequent sentence
in that same section, which provides that "if it appears from
a decision of the court that several parties are entitled to sepaate and different, portions of the claim, each party may pay
for his portion of the claim . . . and patents shall issue
to the several parties according to their respective rights."
So it distinctly appears that notwithstanding the provision in
reference to the rights of the locators to the possession of the
surface ground within their locations, it was perceived that

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

locations would overlap, that conflicts would arise, and a
me.hod is provided for the adjustment of such disputes. And
this, too, it must be borne in mind is a statutory provision for
the final determination, and is. supplementary to that right to
enforce temporary- possession, which, in accordance with the
rules and regulations of mining districts, has always been
recognized.
This question is not foreclosed by any decisions of this
court as suggested by counsel. It is true there is language in
some opinions which, standing alone, seems to sustain the contention. Thus, in Belk v. Meag1er, 104 U. S. 279, 2S-, it is
said:
"Mining claims are not open to relocation until the rights
of a former locator have come to an end. A relocator seeks
to avail himself of mineral in the public lands which another
has discovered. This he cannot do until the discoverer has in
law abandoned his claim, and left the property open for another to take up. The right of location upon the mineral
lands of the United States is a privilege granted by Congress,
but it can only be exercised within the limits prescribed by
the grant. A location can only be made where the law allows it to be done. Any attempt to go beyond that will be
of no avail. Hence a relocation on lands actually covered at
the time by another valid and subsisting location is void ;. and
this not only against the prior locator, but all the world,
because the law allows no such thing to be done."
And again, in Gwillim v. Donnellan, 115 U. S. 45, 49:
"A valid and subsisting location of mineral lands, made and
kept up in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of
the United States, has the effect of a grant by the United
States of the right of present and exclusive possession of the
lands located. If, when one enters on land to make a location, there is another location in full force, which entitles
its owner to the exclusive possession of the land, the first
location operates as bar to the second."
The question presented in each of those cases was whether
a second location is effectual to appropriate territory covered
by a prior subsisting and valid location, and it was held it is

DEL MONTE MIN. CO.. v. LAST CHANCE MiN. CO.

79

Opinion of the Court.

not. Of ttie correctness of those decisions there can be no
doubt.
valid location appropriates the surface, and the
rights given by such location cannot, so long as it remains in
force, be disturbed by any acts of third parties. Whatever
rights on or beneath the surface passed to the first locator can
in no manner be diminished or affected by a subsequent location. But that is not the question here presented. Indeed,
the form in which it is put excludes any impairment or disturbance of the substantial rights of the prior locator. The
question is whether the lines of a junior lode location may be
laid upon a valid senior location for the purpose of defining
or securing "underground or extralateral rights not in conflict with any rights of the senior location." In other words,
in order to comply with the statute, which requires that the
end lines of a claim shall be parallel, and in order to secure
all the unoccupied surface to which it is entitled, with all the
underground rights which attach to possession and ownership
of the surface, may a junior locator place an end line within
the limits of a prior location?
In that aspect of the question the decisions referred to,
although the language employed is general and broad, do not
sustain the contention of counsel. This distinction is recognized in the text books. Thus in I Lindley on M ines, section
363, the author says:
"As a mining location can only be carved out of the unappropriated public domain, it necessarily follows that a subsequent locator may not invade the surface territory of fiis
neighbors and include within his boundaries any part of a
prior valid and subsisting location. But conflicts of surface
area are more than frequent. Many of them arise from honest
mistake, others from premeditated design. In both instapces
the question of priority of appropriation is the controlling
element which determines the rights of the parties. Two
locations cannot legally occupy the same space at the same
time. These conflicts sometimes involve a segment of the
same vein, on its strike; at others, they involve the dipbounding planes underneath the surface. More frequently,
however, they pertain to mere overlapping surfaces. The
.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

same principles of law apply with equal force to all classes of
cases. Such property rights as ai'e conferred by a valid prior
location, so long as such location remains valid and subsisting,
.are preserved from invasion, and cannot be infringed or impaired by subsequent. locators. To the extent, therefore, that
a subsequent location includes any portion of the surface lawfully appropriated and held by another, to that extent such
location is void."
It will be seen that while the author denies the right of a
second locator to enter upon the ground segregated by the
first location, he recognizes the fact that overlapping locations
are frequent, and declares the invalidity of the second location
so far as it affects the rights vested in the prior locator, and
in that he follows the cases from which we have quoted.
The practice of the Land Department has been in harmony
with this view. The patents which were issued -in this case
for the Last Chance and New York claims give the entire
b6undaries of the original locations, and except from the
grant those portions included within prior valid locations.
So that on the face of each patent appears: the- original -survey with the parallel end lines, the territory granted and the
territory. excluded. . The instructions from the Land Department to the surveyors general have been gen'erally in harmony
with this thought. Thus, in a letter from the Commissioner
of the Land Office to the surveyor general of Colorado, of date
November 5, 1874, reported in 1 Copp's Land Owner, p. 133,
are these instructions :
"In this connection I would state that the surveyor general
has no jurisdiction in the matter of deciding the respective
rights of parties in cases of conflicting claims.
"Each applicant for a survey under the mining act is entitled to a survey of the entire mining claim, as located, if
held by.him in accordance with the local, laws and Congressio'nal enactments.
"If, in running the exterior boundaries of a claim, it is
found that: two surveys conflict, the plat and field notes
should show the extent of the conflict, giving the area which
'is embraced in both surveys, and also the, distances from -the

DEL MONTE WIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. CO. 81
Opinion of the Court.

established corners at which the exterior boundaries of the
respective surveys intersect each other."
Again, in a general circular issued by -the Land Department on November 16, 1882, found ii 9 Copp's Land Owner,
p. 162, it is said: "The regulations of this office require that the plats and
field notes of surveys of mining claims shall disclose all conflicts between such surveys and prior surveys, giving the areas
of conflicts.
"The rule has not been properly observed in all cases.
Your attention is invited to the following particulars, which
should be observed in the survey of every mining claim:
"1. The exterior boundaries of the claim should be represented on the plat of survey and in the field notes.
"12. The intersections of the lines of the survey, with the
lines of conflicting prior surveys, should be noted in the field
notes and represented upon the plat.
"3. Conflicts with unsurveyed claims, where the applicant
for survey does not claim the area in conflict, should be
shown by actual survey.
".4. The total area of the claim embraced by the exterior
boundaries should be stated, and also the area in conflict with
each intersecting survey, substantially as follows."
Again, on August 2, 1883, in a letter from the Acting Commissioner to the surveyor general of Arizona, reported in 10
Copp's Land Owner, p. 240, it is said:
"You state, and it is shown to be so by said diagram, that
the said Grand Dipper lode, so located,,is a four-sided figure
with parallel end lines, the provisions of section 2320, U. S.
Revised Statutes being fully complied with.
"The survey of the claim made by the deputy surveyor
cuts off a portion of the right end, shown to be in conflict
with the Emeral d lode, the easterly end line of the Emerald
claim thus becoming one of the boundary lines of the said
Grand Dipper,' and not parallel to the easterly end line of
the Grand Dipper survey.
"I cannot see how you can give your approval to such survey. No reason exists why the survey lines should not conVOL. CLxxI-6

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

form directly to the lines of the location, they being properly
run in the first instance."
It is true that on December 4, 1884, a circular letter was
issued by the Land Department which slightly qualifies the
general instructions previously issued. So that it may, perhaps, be truthfully said that the practice of the Land Department has not been absolutely uniform, and yet the
descriptions which are fouiid in the patents before us show
that notwithstanding the circular of 1884 the former practice still obtains.
It may be said that the statute gives to the first locator the
right of exclusive possession; that an entry upon that territory with a view of making a subsequent location and marking on the ground its end and side lines is a trespass, and that
to justifysuch an entry is to sanction a forcible trespass, and
thus precipitate a breach of the peace. - But no such conclusion
necessarily follows. The case of Atherton v. Fowler, 96 U. S.
513, illustrates this. It appeared that one Page was in lawful
-possession of certain premises claimed under a Mexican grant,
though his title, had not been confirmed by any act of Congress; that while so in possession a party, of persons who had
no interest or claim to any part of the land, invaded it by
force, tore down the fences, dispossessed those who occupied,
and built on and cultivated parts of it under pretence of establishing a right of preemption $o the several parts which they
had so seized. It was held that such forcible seizure of the
premises gave no rights under the preemption law, and it was
said (p. 516):
"It is not to be presumed that Congress. intended, in the
remote regions where these settlements are made, to invite
forcible invasion of the premises of aftother, in order to confer
the gratuitous right of preference of purchase on the invaders.
In parts of the country where these preemptions are usually
made, the protection of the law to rights of person and property is generally but imperfect under the best of circumstances. It cannot, therefore, be believed, without the strongest evidence, that Congress has extended a standing invitation
to the strong, the daring and the unscrupulous to dispossess by

DEL 11ONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE -MIN. CO. 83
Opinion of the Court.

force the weak and the timid from actual improvements on
the -public lands, in order that the intentional trespasser may
secure by these means the preferred right to buy the land of
the Government when it comes into market."
But while thus declaring that it cannot be presumed that
Congress countenanced any such forcible seizure of premises,
the court also observed (p. 516):
"Undoubtedly there have been cases, and may be cases
again, where two persons making settlement on different
parts of the same quarter section of land may present conflicting claims to the right of preemption of the whole quarter
section, andneither of them be a trespasser upon the possession
of the other, for the reason that the quarter section is open,
unenclosed, and neither party interferes with the actual possession of the other. In such cases, the settlement of the
latter of the two may be bona.fde for many reasons. The
first party may not have the qualifications necessary to a preemptor, or he may have predmpted other land, or he may
have permitted the time for filing his declaration to elapse, in
which case the statute expressly declares that another person
may become pre~mptor, or it may not be known that the settlements are on the same quarter."
The distinction thus suggested is pertinent here.. A party
who is in actual possession of a valid location may maintain
that possession and exclude every one from trespassing thereon,
and no one is at liberty to forcibly disturb his possession or
enter upon the premises. At the same time the fact is also to
be recognized that these locations are generally made upon
lands open, unenclosed and not subject to any full actual
occupation, where the limits of possessory rights are vague
and uncertain and where the validity of apparent locations is
unsettled and doubtful. Under those circumstances it is not
strange- on the contrary it is something to be expected and,
as we have seen, is a common experience -that conflicting
locations are made, one overlapping another, and sometimes
the overlap repeated by many different locations. And while
in the adjustment-of those conflicts the rights of the firt
locator to the surface within his location, as well as to veins

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the- Court.

beneath his surface, must be secured and confirmed, why
should a subsequent location be held absolutely void: for all
purposes and wholly ignored? Recognizinig it so far as it
establishes the fact that the second locator has made a claim,
and in making'that claim has located parallel end lines, deprives the first locator of nothing. Certainly, if the rights of
the prior locator are not infringed upon, who is prejudiced by
awarding to the second locator all the benefits'which the
statute gives to the making of a claim? To say that the subsequent locator must- when it appears that his lines are to
any extent upon territory covered by a prior valid location go through the form of making i, relocation simply works
delay and may prevent him, as we have seen, from obtaining
an amount of surface to which he is entitled, unless he
abandons the underground and extralateral rights which are
secured only by parallel end lines.'
In this connection it may be properly inquired what is the
significance of parallel end lines? Is.it to secure to the locator
in all cases a tract in' the shape of a parallelogram? Is it
that the surveys of mineral land shall be like the" ordinary
public surveys in rectangular form, capable of easy adjustment, and showing upon a plat that even measurement which
is so marked a feature of the range, township and section
system? Clearly not. While the conteniplation of Congress
may have been that every location should be in the form of a.
parallelogram, not, exceeding 1500 by 600 feet in size, yet the
purpose also was to permit the location in such a way as to
secure not exceeding 1500 feet of the length of a discovered
vein, and it was expected that the locator would so place it
as in his judgment would make the location lengthwise cover
the course of vein. There is no command that the side lines
shall be parallel, and the requisition that the end lines shall
be parallel was for the purpose of bounding the underground
extralateral rights which the owner of the location may exercise. He may pursue the vein downwards outside the side
lines of his location, but the limits of his right are not to
extend on the course of the vein beyond the end lines projected
downward through the earth. His rights on the surface are

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANTCE MIN. CO. 85
Opinion of the Court.

bounded by the several lines of his location, and the end lines
must be parallel in order that going downwards he shall
acquire no further length of the vein than the planes of those
lines extended downward enclose. If the end lines are not
parallel, then, following their planes downward his rights will
be either converging and diminishing or diverging and increasing the farther he descends into the earth. In view of
this purpose and effect of the parallel end lines it matters not
to the prior locator where the end lines of the junior location
are laid. No matter where they may be, they do not disturb
in the slightest his surface or underground rights.
For these reasons, therefore, we are of opinion that the first
question must be answered in the affirmative.
It may be observed in passing that the answer to this question does not involve a decision as to the full extent of the
rights beneath the surface which the junior locator acquires.
In other words, referring to the first diagram, the inquiry is
not whether the owners of the Last Chance have -a right to
pursue the vein as it descends into the ground south of the
dotted line .s,even though they should reach a point in the
descent in which the rights of the owners of the New York,
the prior location, have ceased. It is obvious that the line
e A, the end line of the New York claim, extended downward
into the earth Will at a certain distance pass to the south of
the line r s,and a triangle of the vein will be formed between
the two lines, which does not pass to the owners of the New
York. The question is not distinctly presented whether that
triangular portion of the vein up to the limits of the south end
line of the Last Chance, b o, extended vertically into the earth,.
belongs to the owners of the Last Chance or not, and therefore we do not pass upon it. Perhaps the rights of the junior
locator below the surface are limited to the length of the vein
within the surface of the territory patented to him, but it is
unnecessary now to consider that matter. All that comes
fairly within the scope of-the question before us is the right
of the owners of the Last Chance to pursue the vein as it dips
into the earth westwardly between the line a d t and the line
Ss, and to appropriate so much of it as is not held by the' prior

Opinion of the Court.

location of the New York, and to that extent only is the question answered. The junior locator is entitled to have the
benefit of making a location, with parallel end lines. The
extent of that benefit is for further consideration.
The second question needs no other answer than that which
is contained in the discussion we have given to the first question, and we, therefore, pass it.
The third question is also practically answered by the same
considerations, and in the view we have taken of the statutes
the easterly side of the New York lode mining claim is not
the end line of the Last Chance lode mining claim.
The fourth ' question presents a matter of importance, particularly in view of the inferences which have been drawn by
some trial courts, state and national, from 4he decisions of
this court. That question is"If the-apex of a vein crosses one end line and one side line
of a lode mining claim, as located thereon, can the locator of
such vein follow it upon its dip beyo.nd the vertical side line
of his location ?"'
The decisions to which we refer are .Mining Company v.
Tarbet, 98 U. S. 463; Iron Silver .Mining- Company v. Elgin
.Mining Company, 118 U. S. 196; Argentine .Xining Company v. Terrible iMining Company, 122 U. S. 478; King v.
Amy c. lining Company, 152 U. S. 222.
Two of these cases have been already noticed in this opinion. In Mining Company v. Tarbet a surface location, 2600
feet long and 100 feet wide had been made. This location
was so made on the supposition that- it followed lengthwise
the course of the vein, and the claim was of the ownership
of 2600 feet in length of such vein. Stibsequent explorations developed that the course of the vein was at right
angles to that which had been supposed, and that it crossed
the side lines, so that there was really but 100 feet of the
length of the vein within the surface area. It was held that.
the side lines were to be regarded as the end lines. In 1.i'on
Silver Mining Company v. Elgia Mining Company the location' Was in the form of a horseshod. The-end lines were
not parallel. The location was quite irregular in form, and

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHACE MIN. CO. ST
Opinion of the Court.

inasmuch as one of the side lines was substantially parallel
with one of the end lines it was contended that this side line

should be considered an end line, and this although the vein
did not pass through such side line. But the court rerused
to recognize any such contention and held that the end lines
were those which were in fact end lines of the claim as located, and that as they were not parallel there was no right
to follow the vein on its dip beyond the side lines. In Argensine Mining Company v. Terrible Mining Conapny the
claims of the plaintiff and defendant crossed each other, and
in its decisioni the court affirmed the ruling in Aiming Cormpany v. Tahet, saying (p. 485):
"When, therefore, a mining claim crosses the course of the
lode or vein instead of being 'along the vein or lode,' the end
lines are those which measure the width of the claim as it
crosses the lode. Such is evidently the meaning of the statute. The side lines are those which measure the extent of the
claim on each side of the middle of the vein at the surface."
In ling v. Amy &e. .linig
Company the prior cases
were reaffirmed, and those lines which on the face of the location were apparently side lines were adjudged end lines
because the vein on its course passed through them, the location being not along the course of the vein but across it.
But in neither of these cases was the question now before us
presented or determined. All that can be said to have been
settled by them is, first, that the lines of the location as made
by the locator are the only lines that will be recognized;
that the courts have no power to establish new lines or make
a new location; second, that the contemplation of the statute
is that the location shall be along the course of th" vein,
reading, as it does, that a mining claim "may equal, but shall
not exceed, 1500 feet in length along the vein or lode;" and,
third, that when subsequent explorations disclose that the
location has been made not along the course of the vein, but
across it, the side lines of the location become in law the
end lines. Nothing was said in either of these cases as to
how much of. the apex of the vein must be found within the
surface, or what rule obtains in case the vein crosses only one

end line. So, when Tast Chance -Mining Company v. Tyler
.Xining Comrpany, 15T U, S. 683, 696, was before us, (in
which the question here stated was presented but not de-.
.cided, the case being disposed of on another ground,) we said,
after referrirg to the.prior baseÂ§, "bat there has been no decision as to what extraterritorial rights exist if a vein enters
at an end and passes out at a side line."
We pass, therefore, to an examination of the provisions of
the statute. Premising- that the discoverer .of a vein makes
the location, that he is entitled to make a location not exceeding 1500 feet 'in length along the course of such vein
and not exceeding "three hundred feet on each side of the
middle of the vein at the surface," that a location thus.made
discloses end and side lines, that he is required to make-the
end lines parallel, that by such parallel end lines he places
limits not merely to the surface area but limits beyond which
. below the surface he cannot go on the course of the vein, that
it must be assumed that he will take all of the length of
the vein that he can, we find from section 2322 that he is entitled to "all veins, lodes and ledges throughout their entire
depth, the top or. apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically." Every vein whose
apex is within the vertical limits of his surface lines passes to
him by virtue of his location. le is not limited to only those
veins which extend from one end line -to another, or from.
one side line to another, or from one line of any kind to
another, but he is entitled to every vein whose top or apex
lies vithin his surface lines. Not only is he entitled to all
veins whose apexes are within such limits, but he is entitled
to them throughout their entire depth, "although such veins,
lodes or ledges may sQ far depart from a perpendicular in
their course downward as to extend outside the vertical
side lines of such surface locations." In other words, given
a vein whose apex is within his surface limits he can pursue
that vein as far as he pleases in its downward course outside
the vertical side lines. But he can pursue the vein in its
depth only outside the vertical side lines of his location, for
the statute provides that the "right of possession to such

DEL MONTE MIN. CO. v. LAST CHANCE MIN. Co.

Opinion of the Court.

outside parts of such veins or ledges shall be confined to such
portions thereof as lie between vertical planes drawn downward as above described, through the end lines of their locations, so continued in their own direction that such planes
will intersect such exterior parts of such veins or ledges."
This places a limit on the length of the vein beyond which
he may not go, but it does not say that he shall not go outside the vertical side lines unless the vein in its course reaches
the vertical planes of the end lines. Nowhere is it said that
he must have a vein which either on or below the. surface
extends from end line to end line in order to pursue that vein
in its dip outside the vertical side lines. Naming limits,
beyond which a grant does not go, is not equivalent to saying
that nothing is granted which does not extend to those limits:
The locator is given a right to pursue any vein, whose apex
is within his surface limits, on its dip outside the vertical
side lines, but may not in such pursuit go beyond the vertical
end lines. And this is all that the statute provides. Suppose
a vein enters at an end line, but terminates half way across
the length of the location, his right to follow that vein on its
dip beyond tlhe vertical side lines is as plainly given by the
statute as though in its course it had extended to the farther
end line. It is a vein, "the top or apex of which lies inside
of such surface lines extended downward vertically." And the
same is true if it enters at an end and passes out at a side line.
Our conclusions may be summed up in these propositions:
First, the location as made on the surface by the locator
determines the extent of rights below the surface. Second,
the end lines, as he marks them on the surface, with the single
exception hereinafter noticed, place the limits beyond which
he may not go in the appropriation of any vein or veins along
their course or strike. Third, every vein "1the top or apex of
which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically" becomes his by virtue of his location, and he may
pursue it to any depth beyond his vertical side lines, although
in so doing he enters beneath the surface of some other proprietor. Fourth, the only exception to the rule that the end
lines of the location as the locator places them establish the

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

limits beyond which he may not go.n the appropriation of a
vein on its course or strike is where it is developed that in
fact the location has been placed not along but across the
course of the vein. In such case the law declares that those
which the locator called his side lines are his end lines, and
those which he called end lines are in fact side lines, and this
upon the proposition that it was the intent of Congress to
give to the locator only so many feet of the length of the
vein, that length to be bounded by the lines which the locator
has established of his location. "Our laws have attempted
to establish a rule by which each claim shall be so many feet
of the vein, lengthwise of its course, to any depth below the
surface, although laterally its inclination shall carry it ever so
far from a perpendicular." .Miing Company v. Taret, 98
U. S. 463, 468.
These conclusions find support in the following decisions:
Stevens v. Williams, 1 McCrary, 480, 490, in which is given
the charge of Mr. Justice Miller to a jury, in the course of
which. he says: "You must, take all the evidence together;
you must take the point where it ends on the south, where
it ends on the north, where it begins on the west and is lost
on the east, and the course it. takes; and from all that you are
to say what is its general course. The plaintiff is not bound to
lay his side lines perfectly parallel with the course or strike of
the lode, so as to cover it exactly. His location may be made
one way or the other, and it may so run that he crosses it the
other way. In such event his end lines become his side lines,
and he can only pursue it to his side lines, vertically extended,
as though they were his end lines, but if he happens to strike
out diagonally, as far as his side lines include the apex, so far
he can pursue it laterally." TFakernan v. 3rorton, decided by.
the Supreme Court of Colorado, June 1, 1897, 49 Pac. iRep.
283, in which Mr. Justice Goddard, whose opinions, by virtue
of his long experience as trial judge in the mining districts
of Leadville and Aspen as well as on the supreme bench of
the Stats, are entitled to great consideration, said (p. 286):
"In instructing the jury that, in order to give any extralateral
rights, it was essential that the apex or top of a vein should

ledge must run from end to end, but he is granted this right
of following 'all veins, lodes and ledges throughout their
entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of his surface
lines.' Upon the fact that an apex is within his surface lines,
all his underground rights are based.. When, then, he owns
an apex, whether it extends through the entire or through but
a part of its location, it should follow that he owns an equal
length of the ledge to its utmost depth. These are the important rights granted by the law. Take them away, and we

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
No. 145. Argued December 7, 8, 1897. -Decided

IONTANA.

May 23,1S98.

The answer given to the fourth question in Del "MonteMining and Milling
Co. v. Last Chance Mining and .ililling Co. ante, 55, compels an affirmance of the judgment below in this case.

THE case was thus stated by the plaintiff in error in his
brief.
The plaintiff in error is the owner and in possession of the
Black Rock lode mining claim situated in the Summit Valley
mining district in Silver Bow County, Montana.
The defendants in error-own two thirds interest, and the
plaintiff in error one third interest in the Niagara lode mining claim situated in the same district and county. The
Niagara lode lies along side of the Black Rock lode so that
the south side line of the Niagara forms or is a part of the
north side line of the Black Rock lode.
The Black Rock lode is the older of the two locations. As
appears from the pleadings in the cause the vein or lode crosses
the east end line and south side line of the Niagara lode 513
feet west of the northeast corner of the Black Rock lode and
dips to the south and under the surface of the Black Rock lode
claim.
The, plaintiff in error entered upon that part of the vein,
east of the point where it crosses the division side line between
the Black Rock and Niagara lode claims and extracted ore
