May 81, 1898.

The grantwhichis the subject of controversy in this case was one which,
at the time of the cession in 1853, was recognized by the, government
of Mexico as ialid, and therefore is ond which it is the duty of this Government to respect and enforce to the extent of one and three fourths
sitios.
In Ainsa v. trited Btates, 161 U. S. 208, it was decided, with reference to
such grants, that while monuments control courses and distances, and
courses and distances control quantity, *hire there is uncertainty in specific description, the quantity named may be of decisive weight, and necessarily is so If the intention to convey only so much and no more is
plain: and this case comes within that rule.

ONOctober 19, 1892, proceeding under section 8 of the act
of March 3, 1891, c. 539, creating the -Court of Private Land
Claims, 26 Stat. 851, the United States filed in that court a
petition against Santiago Ainsa, administrator of the estate
of Frank Ely, deceased, and others, alleging that said administrator claimed to be the owner through mense conveyances
of a large tract of land in the Territory of Ariiona, known as
the Rancho de 'San Jose de Sonoita; that he had not voluntarily come into the court to seek a consideration of his title;
that the title was open to question, and was in fact invalid

and have them settled and adjudicated.
'In-an amended answer the administrator set forth the nature and extent of his title, and prayed that it bb inquired

came on for trial, which resulted in a decree on March 30,
1894, that the claim for confirmation of title be disallowed

and rejected. The opinion by Associate Justice Sluss contains this general statement of the facts:
"On the 29th day of May, 1821, Leon Herreros presented
his petition to the intendente of the provinces Sonora and
Sinaloa, asking to obtain title to two sitios of land at the
place known as Sonoita: The intendente referred the petition
to the commander at Tubac, directing him to cause the tract
to be surveyed, appraised and the proposed sale thereof to be
advertised for thirty days.
"In obedience to this order the officer proceeded to make
a survey of the tract, which was made on the 26th and 27th
days of June, 1821, and on the completion of the survey he
caused it to be appraised, the appraised value being one hundred and five dollars. Thereupon, the proposed sale was advertised for thirty consecutive days by proclamation made by
a crier appointed for that purpose, beginning on June 29 and
ending on the 28th day of July, 1821. Thereupon, on the
31st day of July, 1821, the officer took the testimony of three
witnesses to the effect that tlerreros had property and means
to occupy the tract. On October 20, -1821, the proceedings
above mentioned being reduced to writing, were by the officer returned to the intendente.
"On October 25, 1821, the intendente referred the proceedings to the promoter fiscal for his examination.
"On November 7, 1821, the promoter fiscal reported to the
intendente the regularity of the proceedings and recommending that the land be offered for sale at three public auctions,
and thereupon the auctions were ordered to be held.
"The first auction was held on November 8, 1821, the second on November 9, and the third on 1Npvember 10, 1821.
" At the conclusion of the third au.tion the land was struck
off fo'Herreros at the appraised value by the board of auction,
of which board the intendente was a member and the president.
"All these proceedings being concluded, on the 12th day
of November, 1821, Herreros paid to the officers of the treasury the amount of the appraisement, together with the fees
and charges required to be paid, and with. his concurrence the

intendente and the auction board ordered the expediente of
the proceedings to be reported to the junta superior de hacienda for its approbation, so that when approved the title
might issue.
1"There is no evidence that the sale Nvas approved by the
junta superior de hacienda.
"On the 15th day of May, 1825, Juan Miguel Riesgo, commissary general of the treasury, public -. redit and war of
the'Republic of Mexico for the State of. the West, issued
a title in the usual form purporting to convey the land to
ilerreros in pursuance of the proceedings above referred to
and professing to act under'the authority of the ordinance
of the intendentes of Spain of the year 1786."
The conclusion reached was that "the entire proceedings
set forth in the expediente of this title and the final title
issued thereon were without warrant of law and invalid."
Two.of the justices dissented. Thereupon the administrator
secured an order of severance and took a separate appeal to
this court.

MR. JusTicE BREwER, after making the above statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.
The controversy in this case does not turn upon any defect
in the form of the papers. The contentions of the Government are that the officers who assumed to make the grant
and to execute title papers had no authority to do so, and
upon this ground it was held by th6 Court of Private Land
Claims that the grant was in its inception invalid. Secondly,
that if a valid grant was made it was one of quantity, and
should be sustained for only that amount of land which was
named in the granting papers and paid for by the grantee.

ated by a petition to the intendant, or intendente, as he is
called in the opinion of the court below, of the provinces of
Sonora and Sinaloa, on May 29, 1821; that, so far as that
officer was concerned, they were concluded and the sale completed on November 12, 1821. Nothing seems to have been
done after this date until May 15, 1825, when the commissary
general of the Republic of Mexico for the State of the West
on application issued a title in the usual form. So the' question is as to the power of these officers to bind the government of Mexicp.
Few cases presented to this court are more perplexing than
those involving Mexican grants. The changes in the governing power as well as in the form of government were so frequent, there is so much indefiniteness and lack of precision in
the language of the statutes and'ordinances, and the modes of
procedure were in so many respects essentially different from
those to which we are accustomed, that it is often, quite difficult to determine whether an alleged grant was ,made by
officers who, at the time, w.ere authorized to act for the government, and was consummated according to the forms of
procedure then recognized-as essential. It was undoubtedly
the duty of Congress, as ,it was its purpose in the various
statutory enactments it hao made in respect to Mexican titles,
to recognize and establish every title and right which before
the cession Mexico recognized as good and valid. In other
words, in hamony with the rules of international law, as
well as with the terms of the treaties of cession, the change
of sovereignty should work no change in respect to rights
and titles; that which was good before should be good after;
that which the law would enforce before should be enforcible
after the cession. As a rule, Congress has not specifically
determined the validity of any right or title, but has committed to some judicial tribunal the duty of ascertaining
what were good and 'valid before cession, and provided
that when so determined they should be recognized and
enforced.
Of course, in proceeding under any particular statute the
limitations prescribed by that statute -must control, and wVhat--

ever may be the obligations resting upon the nation by virtue
of the rules of international law or the terms of a treaty, the
courts cannot pass beyond such limitations.. In the case of
Hayes v. United States, just decided, 170 U. S. 637, we called
attention to the fact that in 1he act creating the Court of Privat6 Land Claims there was a prohibition upon the allowance
of any claim "that shall not appear to be upon a title lawfully.
and regularly derived from the government of Spain or Mexico,
or from any of the states of the Republic of Mexico having
lawful authority to make grants of land," and pointed out the
difference between this statute and" those construed in the
Airredondo case, 6 Pet. 691, and thq act of March 3, 1851; c. 41,
9 Stat. 631, considered in the Peraltacase, 19 How. 343. WT
held that under the act of 1891 the court must be satisfied,
not merely of the regularity in the form of the proceedings,
but also that the official body or person assuining to make the
grant was vested with authority, or that the exercise of powpe,
if unwarranted, was subsequently lawfully ratified. We are
not to presume that, because certain officials made a grant,
therefore it was the act of the Mexican government and to be
sustained. It must appear that the officials did have the
power, and we are not justified in resting upon any-legal presumption of the existence of power from the fact of its
exercise.
While this is true, yet when the statutes and ordinances
defining the powers and duties of an officer are somewhat
indefinite and general in their terms, and that fficer was in"
the habit of exercising the same power as was exercised in the
case presented, and such exercise of power was not questioned
by the authorities of Mexico, and grants purporting to have
been made by him. were never challenged, there is reason to
believe that the true construction of the statutes or ordinances
supports. the existence of the power. Cases now before us
disclose that -about the time the intendant acted in this case
similar action was taken by him in respect to other applications for the purchase of land; that through a series of .years,
from 1824: downward, the commissary general, the officer
created by the act of September 21, 1824, recognized his acts

as creating equitable obligations on the part.of the government, and attempted to consummate the sales by papers passing the legal title; that the title papers' thus executed were
duly placed of record in the proper office, and fail to show
that subsequently thereto the Mbxican government took any
steps to question the title or disturb the possession. While
this may not be conclusive as to the validity of the grants and
the existence of. the power exercised by the intendant, it certainly is persuasive, and we should not be justified in lightly
concluding that he did not possess the power which he was in
the habit of exercising.
What powers did the intendant possess at the time this sale
is alleged to have taken place? It is conceded by the government that by the ordinance of December 4, 1786, (at which
time Mexico was a province of Spain,) the intendants had full
authority in reference to the sale of lands. Article 81 of that
ordinance (Reynolds' Spanish and Mexican Land Laws, p. 60)

is as follows:
"ART. 81. The intendants shall also be judges, with exclusive jurisdiction over all matters and questibns that arise in the
provinces of- their districts in relation to the sale, composition
and distribution of crown and seignioral lands. The holders
thereof, and those who seek new grants of the same, shall set
up their rights and make their applications to said intendants,
who, after the matter has been duly examined into by an
attorney of my royal treasury, appointed by themselves, shall
take action thereon, in accordance with law, and in conjunction with their ordinary legal advisers. They shall admit
appeals to the superior board of the treasury, or, should the
parties in interest fail to employ that recourse, submit a report
thereto, together with the original proceedings, when they consider them in condition to issue the title. The board shall,
after examination thereof, return them, either for issue of title,
if no correction is necessary, or, before doing so, for such other
proceedings as in the opinion of the board are required, with
the necessary -instructions. In the meantime, and without
further delay, the necessary confirmation may be made, which
said superior board shall issue at the proper time, proceeding

Opinion of the Court.

in this matter, as also the intendants, their deputies and others,
in accordance with the requirements of the royal instructions
of October 15, 1754, in so far as they do not conflict with
these, without losing sight of the wise provisions of the laws
therein cited and of Law 9, Title XII, Book IV."
It is, however, contended that prior to the transfer of title
in this case this authority was taken away from the intendant.
In support of this contention four matters are referred to by
counsel: 1.- The adoption of the constitution of March 18,
1812, and the promulgation of the law of January 4, 1813.
2. The resolution of the council of the Indies, before a full
board at Madrid, December, 23, .1818. 3. The decrees of
Ferdinand VII, reestablishing the constitution of 1812, and
convoking the Cortes, March 6, 7, 9, 1820. 4. The imperil
colonization law of January 4, 1823.
Of these in their order, though it may be well here to note
that the colonization law was not passed until after the sale
in controversy had taken place.
On March 18, 1812, in the midst of troublous times in Spain,
a constitution (Reynolds, p. 79) was adopted, and by it and
the law of the Cortes, of January 4, 1813, (Reynolds, p. 83,)
it is insisted that a different mode of disposing of the public
lands Was created. As, however, this continued in force only
until May 4, 1814, when the king, Ferdinand VII, returned
to the throne and issued a decree refusing to recognize the
existing .order of things and declaring the constitution of 1812
revoked, it would seem that the powers theretofore vested
in the intendants were re stablished. Indeed, on December
28, 1814, the king issued a royal c~dula or edict, the ninth
article of which is as follows (2 White's lNew Recopilacion,
p. 168):
"The governor intendants shall resume all the powers appertaining to them before the promulgation of the constitution,
so called; and shall consequently exercise said powers, as well
in matters of government as in those of economy and litigation relating to the royal treasury, agreeably to the -laws and
ordinances respecting intendants."
I Clearly thereafter the intendants had the powers given

them by the ordinance of 1786. Sabariego v. _faverick, 124
U. S. 261.
On December 23, 1818, a resolution passed by the council
of the Indies, at Madrid, and approved by the king,, provided
that all business pertaining to the- alienation of lands in New
Spain should belong to the department of the office of the
treasury of the Indies at Madrid. Hall's Me acan Law, p. 76,
see. 188. In March, 1820, Ferdinand VII, under pressure
from the people, adopted the constitution of 18i2 and took an
oath to support it. Did this resolution of December, 1818, or
this reEstablishment of the constitution, or both together, put
an end to the power of the intendafits in respect to the sale
of lands? Clearly the resolution of December, 1818, would
not have that effect. The mere placing of the control over
land matters in a particular government department at
Madrid would in no manner affect the powers of local officers until and unless such department should so order, and
there is no suggestion that any orders to that effect were ever
issued. The resolution would have no more effect on the
powers of the local officers than would a transfer of the land
department of this Government from the control of the Secretary of the Interior to that of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The local officers would simply have to respond to new superiors, and that is all.
Nor do we think that the reestablishment of the Constitution even if the regstablishment -of that instrument carried
.with it the rednactment of the law of the Cortes of January 4,
1813, put an end to the office of intendant, or wholly abrogated his powers. So far as the act of January 4, 1813, is
concerned, while it did authorize the distribution of part of
the lands on account of military service, it still provided that
half of the public and crown lands should be reserved to serve
as a mortgage for the payment of the national debt, and
recognized the disposition of such lands by the "provincial
deputation," as it was called. Turning to the constitution we
find the following provisions in chapter 2, article 324: "The
political government of the provinces shall reside in the
superior chief appointed by the king in each one of them."

OCTOBER TEIM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

Article 325: "Ii each province there shall be a deputation
called provincial, to promote its prosperity, presided over by:
the superior chief." Article 326: "This deputation shall be
composed of the president, the intendant and seven members
elected in the manner that shall be stated." While it may be
that under the terms of these and subsequent articles the
general control over the affairs of a.province was vested in the
provincial deputation, of which deputation the intendant was
to be one member, we find nothing in them that either put
an end to the office of intendant or had any other effect than
to subject his actions to the control of the provincial deputation. The question is not what the provincial deputation
when organized would do, but..whether the mere regstablishment of the constitution, which provided for a provincial
deputation, operated, before any action taken under it, to put
an end to the powers theretofore vested in the intendants.
-It may well be that in thus arranging, for a new system of
control, without abolishing the office of intendant, but on the
contrary, in terms recognizing its continuance, the purpose
was not to create an interim in which no person should have
power to act for the government in the alienation of its lands,
but that the intendant should continue to exercise the powers
he had theretofore exercised until the king should appoint a
superior chief, and the other members of the deputation be
elected.
The very next year witnessed the separation of Mexico from
the kingdom of Spain. On February 24, 1821, a decJaration
of independence was made in the form known as the plan of
Iguala, and this declaration of independence was made good
by the surrender of the City of Mexico on September 27, 1821.
The fifteenth section of this plan'provided that "the, junta
will take care that all the revenues of departments of the
state remain without any alteration whatever, and all the
employ6s, political, ecclesiastical, civil and.military, will remain in the same state in which they exist to-day."
On August 24, 1821, what is known as the treaty of Cordoba was signed at that village by General Iturbide, for
Mexico, and Viceroy O'Donoju, for Spain, the latter, how-

ever, having no previous authority from Spain,. aiid this treaty
wias by Spain afterwards repudiated. This treaty provided
that "the provisional junta was to govern fpr the time being
in conformity with existing laws in everything not opposed
to the plan of Iguala, and until the Oortes shall form the

constitution of the state."

Immediately after the, surrender

of the Oity of Mexico a provisional council or junta, consisting of thirty-six members; was created under ihe plan of
Iguala, which assumed the control of the government, and on

October 5, 1821, this provisional council promulgated the following order (Reynolds, p. 95):
'The sovereign provisional council. of government of the
empire of Mexico, considering that from the moment it
solemnly declared its independence from Spain all authority
for the exercise of the administration of justice and other
public functions should emanate from said empire, has seen fit
to habilitate and confirm all authorities as they now are, in
conformity with the plan of Iguala and the treaty of the
village of Cordoba, for the purpose of legalizing the exercise
of their respective functions."
That the office of intendant was one of those continued in
existence by this order is clearly shown by the decree of September 21, 1824, creating the office of commissary general.
(Reynolds, p. 123.) Its first two articles are:
"ART. 1. So far as concerns the federation, the officers of
general and local depositories, and all revenue employ6s that
have been retained by the federation, are discontinued.
"ART.2. From the intendants and other discontinued
officers the government shall appoint, in each state where it
appears necessary, a commissary general for the different
branches of the exchequer, public credit and war."
Prior -thereto, and on October 24, 1821, the provisional
council passed an order declaring that the office of superintendent general of the treasury was not necessary, and
added, "and in consequence, has decided that the duties of
the superintendency be performed, as your excellency proposed in your said report, by the directories general of the
revenues, the officers of. the treasury and intendants, in the

1IOCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

cases and matters that severally belong to them, in conformity
with their ordinances, without any variation in them." (Reynolds, p. 96.) Ou January 16, 1822, it ordered that, "until
the next august national congress fixes the system of public
revenues, the intendants should remain as they are, except
those who are, reappointed and have, in their former offices,
had a higher salary than that the intendants of Sonora and
Pueblo now have." - (Reynolds, p. 98.) And on February 2,
1822, it directed that "a report of the receipts of the treasuries since independence was sworn to be forwarded by the
intendancies of the empire; and a statement of the receipts
and disbursements of the last fifteen days since the 24th of
December." (Reynolds, p. 99.) So that long after the sale here in question was made the
government of Mexico recognized the office of intendant as
continuing, and no statute or ordinance appears which in terms
at least took away from that officer all control over the sales
of public lands.
It is contended that the mere change of sovereignty revoked all authority to make sales of the public lands, and
United States v. Fallejo, 1 Bla~k, 541, is cited, in which it
was held that the decrees of the Spanish Cortes of 1813, in
relation to the disposition of the crown lands, was inapplicable
to the state of things which existed in Mexico after the revolution of 1820, and could not have been continued in force there,
unless expressly recognized by the Mexican congress.
And also .More v. Steinbach, 127 U. S. 70, 81; in which it
was observed that"The doctrine

.

.

.

that the laws of a conquered or

ceded- country, except so far as they may affect the political
institutions of the new sovereign, remain in force after the
conquest or cession until changed by him, do'es not aid their"
defence. That doctrine has no application to laws authorizing the alienation of any portions of the public domain, or to
officers charged under the -former government with that
power. No proceedings affecting the rights of the new
sovereign over public property can be taken except in pursuance of his authority on the subject."

ELY'S ADMINISTRATOR v. UNITED STATES.

231

Opinion of the Court.

It is doubtless true that a change of sovereignty implies a
revocation of the authority vested by the prior sovereign in
local officers to dispose of the public,lands. And yet we think
that rule is not controlling in this case, for the new sovereign
made an order continuing the functions of the local officers,
and one.of those local officers making a sale in accordance
with the provisions of the prior laws caused the money received therefrom to be paid. into the treasury 6f the new
sovereign, and that sovereign never returned the money
thus received, nor challenged the validity of the sale thus made.
This is not a case in which the local officers attempted to dispose of public lands ih satisfaction of obligations created by
the former sovereign, but one in which a sale was made for
money, and that money passed into the treasury of the new
sovereign.
Again, the original ordinance of intendants provided for an
examination of the proceedings.by "an attorney of my royal
treasury." The proceedings had in this case were referred to
the promoter fiscal, such being the name of the legal adviser
of the treasury department, who approved them. So we have
presented the case of a sale made by an officer who at one
time undoubtedly had power to make a sale, who was directed
by the original ordinance creating his office and establishing
his powers to refer his proceedings to the legal adviser, a reference of the proceedings had by him to such legal adviser
and a decision of such adviser that the proceedings were regular and that the sale ought to be consummated. Under those
circumstances it is not inappropriate to refer to what was said
in Mitehel v. United States, 9 Pet. 711, 742, in reference to
the validity of. a grant in Florida:
'cIt was done also on the deliberate advice of an officer responsible to the crown, which makes the presumption very
strong, if not irresistible, that everything preceding it had
been lawfully and rightfully done."
Again, it must be noticed that according to the report of
the proceedings the money received for this land was paid into
the public treasury, the entry on the account book being in
these words:

It would seem not unwarranted and unreasonable to refer to
the familiar rule that where an agent, even without express
authority makes a- sale of the property of his principal, and
the latter with full knowledge receives the money paid on
account thereof, his retention of the putchase price is equivalent to. a ratification of the sale. We do not mean, however,
to state this as a general proposition controlling all municipal
and governmental transactions, but only as one of the circumstances tending to strengthen the conclusion that these acts of
the intendant were not mere usurpations of authority, but were
in the discharge of duties and the exercise of powers conceded
to belong to his office.

Passing beyond the action of the intendant, we find t*hat
in 1825 the commissary general executed title papers, thereby
ratifying the sale made by the intendant four years before.
We have heretofore quoted articles 1 and 2 of the act of
September 21, 1824, creating such office. We now quote
articles 3, 4 and 5:
"ART. 3. These commissaries shall be, in the state or states
and territories of tbeif demarcation, head officers of all

ELY'S ADMINISTRATOR v. UNITED STATES.

233

Opinion of the Court.

branches of the exchequer. Consequently, they are responsible for the prompt execution of the laws that govern their
administration, and all employ~s thereof shall be subordinate
to them.
"ART. 4. They shall collect and disburse, under the laws
and 6rders of the government, the proceeds from the revenues and the contingents of the states.
"ART. 5. The revenue on powder, salt deposits, the proceeds from the revenue on tobacco that belong to the federation, national properties and vacant lands (cascos), contingents,
customs, tolls and all the branches pertaining to the public
credit, shall be administered directly by the commissary.
The revenue on tobacco in the places where raised, that from
the maritime.customs, from the mail and lotteries, shall continue under their special administration, subordinate in all
respects to the commissaries."
Obviously these articles gave to this newly created -officer
the fullest powers in r-espect to the national revenues. When
an office is created with such large powers as these and the
incumbent thereof reviewing proceedings theretofore had by
prior representatives of the government, and finding that a
sale made by one of such prior officers has resulted in the
payment of the cash proceeds thereof into the public treasury,
confirms his action, ratifies his proceedings and issues appropriate title papers therefor, it would seem that any doubts
which might hang over the power of the prior officer were
put at rest, and that thereafter no question could be raised as
to the validity of the sale.
And, indeed, such seems to have been the assumption on
the part of the government of Mexico, for there is no suggestion that from the time of the execution of these title papers
in 1825 up to the date of the cession, 1853, the g6vernment
ever raised any question as to the validity of the sale or
sought to disturb the possession of the grantee. While of
course time does not run against, the government, and no
prescription, perhaps, may be affirmed in favor of the validity
of this grant, yet the inaction of the government during these
many years is very persuasive, not merely that it dofisidered

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

that the intendant had the power to make the sale, but that
infact he did have such power. These considerations lead us
to the conclusiQn that this grant was one which, at the time
of the cession in 1853, was recognized by the government of
Mexico as valid, and therefore one -which it was the duty of
this Government to respect and enforce.
We pass, therefore, to a consideration of the second question, and that is, the extent of the grant. It is claimed by
the appellant that the grant should be sustained to the extent
of the outboundaries named in the survey. He insists that
the accepted rule of the common law is, that metes and bounds
control area; that a survey was in fact made and possession
given according to such survey, and that although it now
turns out that the area within the survey is largely in excess
of the amount applied and paid for, the grant must be held
effective for the area within the survey.
We had occasion to examine this question in Ainsa v.
United States, 161 U. S. 208, 229, and there said:
"So monuments control courses and distances, and courses
and distances control quantity, but where there is uncertainty
in specific description, the quantity named may be of decisive
weight, and necessarily so if the intention to convey only: so
much and no more is plain."
We think this case comes within the rule thus stated. The
defendant, in his answer, alleges that the grant comprises
12,147.69 acres, while counsel for the Government say that
the measurements given by the surveyor make the area
22,925.87 acres. The amount of land appraised, advertised,
sold and auctioned off was one and three quarter sitios
(7591.61 acres). While, of course, any slight discrepancy
between the area, of the survey and that ostensibly sold might
be ignored, yet the difference between the amount which was
understood to have been sold 'and the amount now found to
be within the limits of the survey is so great as to suggest the
propriety of the application of the rule laid down in Ainsa
v. United States, supra.' There -can be no doubt from the
record of the proceedings that one and three quarter sitios
was all that the purchaser supposed he had purchased; all

that the intendant supposed he had sold, and all that was
advertised or paid for. The original petition, after stating
that there was a place knowit. as San Jose de Sonoita, declared
that the petitioner registered "in the aforesaid place two
sitios of land," which he desired to have surveyed, and to pay
therefor the just price at which it might be valued. The
petition, therefore, was not for any tract known by a given
name, but for a certain amount of land in such place. The
report of the survey is very suggestive. We quote from.it as
follows:
"In the ancient abandoned place of San Jose de "Sonoita,
on the 26th day of the month of June, 1.821, I, the said lieutenant commander and subdelegate of the military post and
company of Tubac and its jurisdiction, in order to make the
survey of the land denounced by Don Leon HIerreros of this
vicinity, delivered to the appointed officials a well-twisted
and stretched cord, and in my presence was delivered to them
a castilian vara, on' which c6rd" were measured and counted
fifty regulation varas, and this being done, at each were tied
poles, and standing on the spot assigned- by the claimant as
the centre, which was in the very walls of the already mentioned Sonoita, there were measured in a northeasterly directi~n sixty-three cords, which ended at the foot of some low
hills, a little ahead of a spring-a chain of mountains of a
valley which goes on and turns to the east, where was placed
a heap of stones as a monument; and being about io return to
the centre, the claimant expressed a desire that the survey
should be continued down the canon until the two sitios
should be completed, that on each side we should survey to
him only twenty-five cords, because if the survey should extend further, by reason of the broken-up condition of the
country and the rocky hills in sight, such land would be useless to him, saying, at the same time, that, continuing the
measurement along the canon (because it was impossible to
go in any other direction on account of the roughness df the
ground), by reason of the many turns that had to be made,
so many cords should. be deducted from the total number
measured, as would be calculated to result in excess of the

real length measured, taken on a straight line, and considering
his demand reasonable I ordered the continuation of the survey as follows, to wit.

"And in view of the suggestion made by the claimant to.
reduce the number of cords actually measured so much as
might be calculated to be in fact in excess of the true
measurement by reason of the many turns of the canon over
which the survey was made, as it could not be carried on
straight, I appointed for that purpose Lieutenant Don Manuel
Leon and the citizen Don lose Ma. Sotelo, who were unanijilously of the opinion to deduct twenty-five cords out of the
three hundred and twelve cords measured in the last survey
down the canon, the claimant consenting thereto as just; the
survey was calculated to be two hundred and eighty-seven
cords, with which this survey was finished, resulting from it
one sitio and three fourths of another sitio, registered by Don
Leon IHerreros for raising stock and for farming purposes."
The appraisers reported as follows:
"In virtue thereof they said that according to and because
of the examination they had made and being aware of the existing regulations on the subject, the price should be fixed at,
and they fixed it at, sixty dollars for each sitio, because they
have running water and several banks of arable land which
I
can be made use of by cultivation."
The directibn for the almoneda or qffer of sale was of the
lands "composed of one sitio and three fourths of another."
The first almoneda was of lands "comprising one sitio and
three fourths of another,

and appraised in the sum of

one hundred and five dollars, at the rate of sixty dollars per
sitio." The property put up for sale was lands " comprising one

appraised at one

hundred and five dollars, at the rate of sixty dollars each sitio."
The report of the promoter fiscal opens with this statement:
"The promoter fiscal of this treasury has examined carefully the expediente of the lands surveyed in favor of Don
Leon Ierreros, resident of the military post of Tubac, by the
Commissioner Don Elias Ygnacio Gonzales, lieutenant con-

mander of the post, in the place called San Jose de Sonoita, in
that jurisdiction, from which resilted one sitio and three
fourths of another, for raising stock and horses, valued at sixty
dollars eacqh sitio, which sums up one hundred and five dollars,
as it has running water and some pieces of land fit for cultivation."
Subsequently to this report the direction was made for three
public auctions, which were made, and the record of the first
auction, the others being similar, is in these words :
"1stauction. At the city of Arizpe, on the 8th day of the
month of November, 1821, there convened as a board of
auction the intendente as president and the members composing the board, in order to make the first auction of the lands
.referred to in this expediente. They caused many persons to
collect by the beating of drums at the office of the intendencia,
and in their presence they made the crier, Loreto Salcido, announce, as he did in a loud and clear voice, saying: ' There is
to-be auctioned at this board of auction one sitio and three
fourths,of another of public lands, for raising cattle, comprised
in the place of San Jose de Sonoita, in the jurisdiction of the
military post of Tubac, surveyed in favor-of Don Leon Herreros, resident of the same, and appraised in the sum of one
hundred and five dollars, at the rate of sixty dollars per sitio;
whoever wants to make a -bid on it, let him do so before fiis
board, which will admit it if done properly; with the understandingthat at the third and last auction, which will take
place the day after to-morrow, the property will be sold to the
highest bidder.'
The payment was, as appears from the entry in the treasury
office, heretofore quoted, of "-one hundred antd five dollars as
the principal value for which was .auctioned by this inten-.
dencia one sitio and three quarters of another of lands for raising cattle, contained in the place of San Jose de Sonoita."
So, notwithstanding the fact that as shown by the report of
the surveyors, a.sirvey was made, all the proceedings from
the commencement to the close contemplated, not the purchase
of a given tract of land, but a certain amount of land in the
place of San Jose de Sonoita. Every consideration of equity,

therefore, demands that the'title of the purchaser should be
confined to the one and three fourths sitios.for which he paid.
As indicated in Ainsa v. United States, 8upra, too much

stress cannot .be laid on the technical rules of the common law
in reference to the dominance of courses and distances over area.
It is a matter of common knowledge that in this part of the
country large areas byond the, immediatereach of water
coures or springs were arid; .that purchases were of lands so
watered or so suiceptible of watering that crops could be ex.-pected therefrom, or pasturage furnished for stock. The land.
beyond the reach of these water supplies was deemed of little
value, and hence slight attentioii was paid to it. Every purchase theref6re must be Considered as d6minated by this important and single fact. 'Rude methods of measurement were
resorted to. As shown in the report of the survey in this
case mere estimates were relied upon. Doubtless this carelessness was partly owing to the fact disclosed in Ainsa v. United
States, that any overplus above the actual amount paid for still
remained the property of the government, payment for which
could be compelled of the locator, or, on his failure to make
such payment, could be appropriated by. any third party desiring to purchase. The fact that during these years no challenge was made of the overplus is not important. The
government was indifferent. Its rights could be enforced at
its leisure, and no individual cared to purchase any surplus of
arid lands. The presumption which might obtain in other
places from the inaction of the government, the failu.re of any
individual to assert a claim to the overplus, is in respect to the
lands in this territory 'of no significance. Who there would
care to question the right of a locator along a waterway to
any overplus of arid lands? Such bverplus was of no value,
and no third party would ever care to challenge the locator's
right to this overplus, and the government, like the individual, was also indifferent. So the silence and inaction of the
government and third parties are not strange, and create no
presumption in favor of the validity of the grant to the extent
of the survey.
Sustaining the validity of the grant to the extent of the

land paid for is but carrying out the spirit of the, treaty, the
obligations of international justice and the duties: imposed by
the act creating the Court of Private Laud Claims. Article 8
of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided in reference to
the ceded territory that "TMexicans now established in territories previously belonging to Mexico, and which remain for
the future within the limits of the United States, as defined
by the present treaty, shall be free to continue where they
now" reside, or to remove at any time to the Mexican republic,
retaining the property which they possess in the said te'rritories, or disposing thereof, and removing the proceeas whereverthey please, without their being, subjected, on this account,
to any contribution, tax or charge'whatever," and that "in
the said terKritories, property of every kind, now belonging to
Mexicans not established there, shall be inviolably respected"
9 Stat. 929; and these stipulations were reaffirmed in Article
5 of the Gadsden treaty. 10 Stat. 1035. Article 6 of that
treaty, which placed a limitation, provided "that no grants of
land within the territory -ceded . . . will be considered
vaiid or be recognized by the United States, or will any grants
made previously be respected or be considered as obligatory,
which have not been located and duly recorded in the archives
of Mexico." But this limitation is not to be understood as
denying the obligations imposed by the rules of international
law'in the case of cession of territory, but simply as defining
specifically the evidences of title which are to be recognized.
The spirit of the treaty is fully carried out when the amount
of land petitioned and paid for is secured to the grantee or
his successors in interest. This Government promised to inviolably respect the -property of Mexicans. That means the
property as it then was, and does not imply any addition to
it. The cession did not increase rights. That which was
beyond challenge before remained so after. That which was
subject to challenge 'before. did not become a vested right
after. No duty rests on this Governmentto recognize the
validity of a grant to any area of gkeater extent than was
recognized by.the government of Mexico. If that government had a right, as we have seen in Ainsa v. United Stat8

240

Opinion of the Court.

it had, to compel payment for an overplus or resell such overplus to a third party, then this Government is under no moral
or legal obligations to consider such overplus as granted, but
.may justly and equitably treat the grant as limited to the area
purchased and paid for.
It- may be said that to consider the tract, granted as one not

extending to the limits of the autboundaries of the survey is
to hold that the tract granted was not located, and therefore
within the terms of the Gadsden treaty, not to be recognized
by this Government, as suggested in Ainsa v. United States.
In that case it appeared that. while the outboundaries of the
survey extended"int6. the territory ceded by Mexico t6 the
United States, the grantee had taken and was in possession of
land still remaining within the limits of Mexico, to. the full
extent which he had puichased and paid for, knd therefore no
legal or equitable claim existed against the United States in
reference to land within the ceded territory.
It is also undoubtedly true, as disclosed in that case, that
where there is a mere grant, of a certain number of acres
wvithin specified outboundaries there may be such indefiniteness as to prevent a court from declaring the true location of
the granted lands. "A6ndyet it is also true that there may be
disclosed by the survey or other proceedings that Which will
enable a court'of:equity, to determine with reasonable certainty
.what lands were intended to be granted and the title to which
should be established. .It must be remembered in this connection that by section 7 of the act creating the Court of Private
Land .0laims, it i6 provided "that all proceedings subsequent
to the filing of said petition shall be conducted as near as may
be according to the practice of-. the courts of equity of the
United States." Therefore in an iivestigation of this kind
that court is not limited to the dry, technical rules of a court
of law, but may inquire and establish that which equitably
was the land granted by' the government of Mexico. It was
doubtless the purpose of Congress, by this ehactment, to pro'vide a tribunal which should examine all claims and titles, and
that should, so far as.was practicable in conformance with equitable rules, finally settle and determine the rights of all claim-

ants. It will be unnecessarily limiting its powers to hold that
it can act only when the grant to the full outboundaries of the
survey is valid and is powerless when a tract within those outboundaries was granted. Many things may exist by which
the real tract granted can be established. In the case before
us, if it be possibl to locate the central point from which
according 'to the report the survey was made (and we judge
from the testimony that it is possible) the actual grant can'-be
established by reducing each measurement therefrom to such
an extent as to make the area that of the tract purchased and
.paid for. If the outboundaries disclose a square or any rectangular figure, the excess of area suggests simply a carelessness of measur~fnent, and can be corrected by a proportionate
reduction in each direction. In other cases, the location of
the waterway, the configuration of the ground, may be such
as to enable a court of equity by its commissioner or master
to determine exactly what was intended to pass under the
grant. We do not mean to anticipate all the questions that
may arise. We simply hold that the mere fact that the grant
is narrower than the limits of the outboundaries does not prevent the Court of Private Land Claims from determining
through the- aid of a commissioner, surveyor or master exactly
what equitably did pass under the grant. It is enough for
this case to 'hold that the powers of the Court of Private
Land Claims are not narrow and restricted, and that, when it
finds that there is a valid grant for a certain number of acres
within the outboundaries of a larger tract, it may inquire, and,
if it finds sufficient reasons for determining the true boundaries of the tract that was granted, it can so prescribe them,
and sustain the claim to that extent, referring to the Land
Department the final and absolute surveys thereof.
An view of these considerations,we are of opinion that this
grant should. be sustained to the amount of one and three
.fourths
sitios, and the judgment of the Court of Privata"
Land Claims is reversed azd the ease remanded to that
tribunal, with. directions to examine and decide whether
there be stff cient facts to enable it to determine the true
boundaries of the one and three fourths sitios.
