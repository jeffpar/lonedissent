McCRRARY v. PENNSYLVANIA CANAL COMPANY
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 54. Submitted October 22, 1891.-

Decided November 9, 1891.

In estimating, in a suit for the infringement of letters patent, the profits
wnch the defendant has made by the use of the plaintiff's device, where
such device is a mere improvement upon what was known before and
was open to the defendant to use, the plaintiff is limited to such profits as
have arisen from the use of the improvement over what the defendant
might have made by the use of that or other devices without such improvement.
u inventor took out letters patent for an invention intended to accomplish
a certain result. Subsequently he took out a second patent, covering the
invention protected by the first, and accomplishing the same result by a
further improvement. While holding both patents, he sued to recover
damages for the infringement of the second, without claiming to recover damages for the infringement of the first. HeZd, that he could
recover only for the injuries resulting from use of the further improvement covered by the second letters, and that if no such injury were
shown the defendant would be entitled to judgment,

Tins was a bill in equity for the infringement of letters patent
number 129,844, issued July 23, 1872,.and reissued as number
5630, October 28, 1873, to the appellant, John Mcreary, for
an "improvement in coupling and steering apparatus." In
the specification of the reissue the patentee stated that his
invention related "to certain improvements in devices for steering canal boats," etc., described in letters patent granted to
:Elijah and John McCreary, April 16, 1872, number 125,684,
by means of which two boats are coupled together, and navigated -and steered as one boat by means of a single steeringwheel. The invention described in said letters patent consisted,

principally, "in coupling two boats together by means of a
chain or rope passing around a steering-wheel on one boat, and
around a system of sheaves or pulleys, and attached to the
other boat, for the purposes of steering said boats as well as of
coupling them, and in centring said boats together and form-

ing a universal joint between them by means of an overhanging
guard or bumper on the stern of the forward boat, with a centrar notch therein, into which the projecting stem or cutwater
of the rear boat fitted." "Mfy improvements," says the patentee,
"consist, first, in coupling and centring said boats together
and forming a universal joint between them by means of a
chain, the two ends of which are fastened to opposite points
on the stern of the forward boat and the central part to the
stem or cutwater, or some central point on the bow of the
rear boat, so as to hold its stem or cutwater against the overhanging guard or bumper of said forward boat, said chain
serving to Icentre the boats without the necessity of any notch
in the overhanging guard for the stem of the rear boat to fit
into, and at the same time coupling and holding the boats
together and forming a universal joint between them, second,
in attacning the ends of the coupling and steering chains to
the boats by means of crow-foot claw-hooks so as to render the
chains easily adjustable, as hereinafter shown and described."
lHe claimed as his invention
"1. The combination of the two boats A and B,the steeringchain a passing around sheaves or pulleys, and around the
windlass C, or its equivalent, the overhanging guard or bumper
on the stern of the forward boat, and the chain D attached to
opposite points on the stern of said boat and to the stem or
central part of the bow of the rear boat, so as to form a universal joint between them, and keep them coupled and centred,
substantially as shown and described.
"2. In combination with the boats A and B and the coupling and steering mechanism herein described, the claw-hooks

chains, substantially as set -forth."
Upon the hearing in the Circuit Court an interlocutory decree
was entered in favor of the plaintiff, finding the validity of the
patent, and the infringement by the defendant, and ordering
-reference to a master for an account of the "profits, gains
and advantages which the said defendant has received or made,
or which have arisen or accrued to it" from the said infringement, etc., but denying the injunction upon the ground, stated

in the opinion of the court, XcCreary v Pennsylvanza Canal
Co., 5 Fed. Rep. 367, that its allowance would cause much
greater injury to the defendant than benefit to the plaintiff.
A large amount of testimony was taken before the master,
who reported that he found no proven profits, savings or
advantages to have been received by or accrued to defendant
from the manufacture, use or sale of the plaintiff's patented
improvements. Exceptions were filed to this report, and upon
the hearing of such exceptions a final decree was entered in
accordance with the report, and that the plaintiff should recover
his costs, except the costs of the accounting before the master,
and the costs of the exceptions to the master's report, which
were awarded to the defendant. The decree was subsequently
amended by ordering that the defendant pay all the costs of
the suit. From the decree denying the recovery of profits and
damages an appeal was taken to this court.

BRowN, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
About three months prior to the patent in suit, and on April
16, 1872, another patent, numbered 125,68-, was issued to
Elijah and John McCreary, for "an improvement in steering
devices for canal-boats," etc., which covered a similar coupling
together of boats, barges and scows by means of a vertical
groove formed in the overhanging stern guard or bumper of
the forward boat, which groove was entered by the cutwater
of the rear boat, a chain being used for connecting the boats,
which chain was so connected with a train of gear-wheels
placed in the rear boat as to enable both boats to be steered
by means of a windlass. The first claim of this patent was as
follows
"11. Two boats or barges, A and B, fitted together by means
of a projecting cutwater fitting into a notch m an overhanging
guard. as described, and coupled and steered by means of a

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

onam or rope, having its ends fastened to the forward boat
and passing around pulleys,
substantially as herein set
forth. "'
The second claim was immaterial.
In patent. numbered 129,844 the patentee stated that his.
improvement upon the prior patent consisted "in substituting for the projecting cutwater and notch, described in said
patent for centring the boats together, and forming a universal joint, a chain attached at both ends to one boat, and at
its centre to a central point on the adjacent end of the other
boat," etc.
One of the main difficulties in the assessment of damages in
this case arises from the fact that the two patents, the first
one of which -is not included in this bill, describe a system of
coupling together two boats by means of chains and a centrmg device much the same - differing from each other only
in two particulars First, in the earlier patent, the two boats
are connected together by the cutwater of the rear boat fitting
a groove in the overhanging guard of the forward boat, while
in the later patent, there is substituted for this -achain attached
by both ends to the forward boat, and at its centre to a central point on the adjacent end of the rear boat. Second, in
the later patent, the centre of the chain is wound around a
horizontal windlass, while in the earlier it is wound around a
separate wheel geared to.the windlass below the deck -a difference which it was not insisted was material. In this connection,
the. master found that "the combination of the patent in suit
and that of the prior patent are practically identical in function
and result, and are identical in constitution, save only as to
.one particular element, the 'centring' device. As, therefore,
the combination of the patent in suit is one, the sole invention
and novelty of which consisted of a single element, the profit
whxch complainant is entitled to recover from the defendant in
this case iR that which he may have shown to have accrued to
it from the use of substantially that new element in substantially the combination in which he has described and claimAed
it." Exception. was taken to this finding, upon the ground
that the finding contained an "erroneous construction of law,

McCREARY v. PENNSYLVANIA CANAL CO.

Opinion of the Court.

if it means that the complainant is not entitled to recover the
entire profits which have accrued to the defendant from the
use of boats containing the invention described and claimed in
the patent in suit because of anything shown or described, but
not claimed, in said prior patent of the complainant numbered
125,684." Plaintiff claimed, and offered evidence tending to
show, that defendant had made a large sum in "savings" by
the transportation of coal in its infringing double boats in
place of single boats, and asked that defendant should be held
accountable to him for these savings (less the cost of applying
the couplings to the double boats) as its profits from the use of
this improvement.
The master found, however, in this connection, that complainant was not entitled, upon the proofs, to recover from the
defendant as its profits from the use of his "improvement"
the entire savings in freight accruing from the shipping of
coal in the infringing coupled boats in place of single boats,
but was restricted to such as were attributable solely to the
improvement.
There is no doubt of the general principle that, in estimating
the profits the defendant has made by the use of the plaintiff's
device, where such device is a mere improvement upon what
was known before, and was open to the defendant to use, the
plaintiff is limited to such profits as have arisen from the use
of the improvement over what the defendant might have made
by the use of that or other devices without such improvements.
This is a familiar doctrine announced by this court in a number of cases. Seymour v Mcorm ek, 16 How 480, Mfowry
v Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, Littlefjeld v Perry, 21 Wall. 205,
Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 97 U. S. 126, Garretson v Clark,
111 U. S. 120.
The important question in this connection is, whether, in
considering what was already known, and open to the defendant to use, we are to include the device shown in patent numbered 125,684, issued to Elijah and John MeOreary about three
months before the patent in suit. There were other methods
of connecting vessels in train, such as were disclosed in the
British patent to Taylor of 1846, the British patent to Bourne

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

of 1857, the patent to McCreary of 1860, constructed and put
iht use upon a coupled boat called "The Experiment," the
British patent, to Bartholomew of 1862, and the American
.patent to Stackpole of 1866 but none of these seem to have
been adapted to defendant's use with any advantage over
single -boats, because, as the master found, "their construction
was such-that a rudder could not be applied to the forward
boat." He found, further, that "these prior boats were in
other respects inferior to the machines of complainant's patent,
but their fatal defect for defendant's purposes was this inability to apply a rudder to the forward boat; which was therefore
unmanageable when separated from its mate."
There is nothing, however, to show that the device described
in the patent of, April 16, 1872, to the McCrearys, was not an
operative device, and if it were open to the defendant to use,
the plaintiff, in this action, would be limited in his recovery to
the profits which the defendant made by the use of the,
improvement described in the-second patent, over the .device
shown in the earlier patent. This improvement, as before
stated, consisted principally in substituting for the projecting
cutwater and notch,. described in the earlier patent, a chain
attached at both ends to one boat, and at its centre to.a central
point upon the adjacent end of the other boat. No attempt
was made to distinguish or separate the profits arising from
this improvement, the testimony being directed only to showing the profits defendant made by the-use of coupled boats in
the place of single boats. There was evidence tending strongly
to show that the transportation of coal in double boats was
more economically effected than in single boats, but none that
the second patent was superior to the first. Indeed, the plaintiff admitted, in his argument, that the patent of April 16
described a plan of coupling and steering very little inferior to
that described in the patent sued upon, and that, if defendant
had pirated that invention instead of this, the same result in
profits or savings would have been realized. Plaintiff, however, contended in this connection, that in determining the
state of the art, or what was open to the defendant to use,
the invention disclosed in the earlier patent to the McCrearys

McCREARY v. PENNSYLVANIA CANAL CO. 465
Opinion of the Court.

should not have been considered, as this patent was also owned
by John McCreary, the plaintiff, by assignment of Elijah's
interest to him before the reissue sued upon was granted, and
hence, that defendant had no more right to use this invention
than the other. Had this earlier patent also been made the
basis of suit in this case, this position would have been impregnable, but the question here is, not whether the, defendant had
in fact the right to use this patent, but whether, so far as this
particular case is concerned, it had not that right. To hold
that it had not is to assume that the plaintiff owned the earlier
patent, that it was. a valid patent and that defendant had
infringed it. This. was a question that could ot be raised
upon an assessment of damages in this case. It is true the
plaintiff claims to be the sole owner of this patent, that it
described an invention both novel and useful, and that defendant had appropriated this device as well as the one set forth
in the patent in suit, but these were issues which could only be
determined upon a bill framed for this purpose, and could not
be made the subject of contest in a collateral proceeding. For
the purposes of this suit the master was bound to assume that
this patent was open to the defendant, otherwise he might be
led into inquiries entirely foreign to the subject of his investi'ation.
Suppose, for example, this patent had belonged to another
person, and the plaintiff, foreseeing that the defendant would,
upon this hearing, claim that it was open to him, had pur
chased itand tiiken an assignment of all claims for -ast infringements, could he in this way forestall such defence?
Clearly not. 'In such case the defendant might justly reply"I was summoned here to answer a charge of infringing your
patent. and in case it is established to pay such damages as
may be awarded for such infringement. But I could not
anticipate that you would purchase another patent and set it
up in aggravation of such damages." But if this could not
be done pending the suit, it is difficult to see how it could be
done before suit brought, if such patent be not made the basis
of the suit. Had the defendant attempted to justify by setting up a device obtained subsequent to the date of the plainVOL. CXLI-30

tiff's patent, a different question would have arisen. This
question was considered by Mr. Justice Harlan, in Turril v
Illinos Central Railroad, 20 Fed. Rep. 912, in which he held
that in. estimating the profits made by the infringer of a patent, the comparison must be between the patented invention
and what was known and open to the public at-and before the
date of the patent.
The case of Seymour v iXcCormwTck, 16 How 480, while
not exactly in point, is somewhat analogous to the one under
consideration. This was an action at common law to recover
damages for the infringement of certain improvements in
reaping machines. There were three patents issued, in 1834,
1845 and 18417, the earliest of these patents had expired. The
first count charged an infringement of the patent of 1845, the
second that of 1847. The plaintiff, to avoid delay,, consented
to go to trial on the second count only, which was for an
improvement upon prior patents, consisting chiefly in giving
to the raker of the grain a convenient seat upon the machine.
The court permitted the 3ury to assess the damages as for the
infringement of the entire machine, defendant insisting that
he was liable only for the damages occasioned by the infringement of the improvement- in other words, that the plaintiff
had the right to recover as great damages for the infringement of the patent set forth in the second count as if he had
proceeded upon both counts, and shown infringement of all
the patents claimed. The case was removed to this court by
writ of error, and the plaintiff in error argued that, for the
purposes of that suit, the defendant had a perfectly lawful
right to use the machine described in the patent of 1834,
(which had, in fact, become public property,.and the improvements in the patent of 1845, and a large portion of those included in that of 1847. These covered the whole of the
improved reaper, except what related to the seat, and its combintion with the reel. He further claimed that, as the plaintiff had decided not to proceed, on his patent of 184:5, that
was in effect public property, that by waiving any right to
proceed upon the first claim of his patent of 18417, he had
limited himself to the seat, combined with the reel, and that

the ruling of the court allowed the plaintiff damages to as
great an extent as if'the trial had, been in a suit upon the old
patents of 1834 and 184:5, and upon the first claim of that of
18417 as well as the second, and was therefore erroneous. 'It
seems that the defendant sought to attack the validity of the
patent of 1845, but the evidence was ruled out, still the plaintiff was allowed to recover for the profits of the part of the
machine covered by this patent, as if it had been included in
the patent of 18417. This court adopted the reasoning of the
plaintiff in error, reversed the judgment of the court below,
and held that the plaintiff should be limited in his recovery to
the damages occasioned by the infringement of the second
claim
the patent of 1847. "1The jury," said Mr. Justice
Grier, in the opinion of the court, "gave a verdict for nearly
double the amount demanded for the use of three several
patents, in a suit where the defendant was charged with violating one only, and that for an improvement of small importance when compared with the whole machine."
If plaintiff be unable to recover damages for the infringement of a patent originally included in a suit, but upon which
he elects not to proceed, it is difficult to see how he can recover for the infringement of one not made the basis of any
action at all. It is true that the combination of the earlier
patent in this case is substantially contained in the later. If
it be identical with it or only a colorable variation from it, thA
second patent would be void, as a pabentee cannot take out
two patents for the same invention. James v. Campbell, 104:
U S. 356. If it be for a different device, then plaintiff could
not recover damages for its infringement without making it
the basis of suit.
We think, therefore, that for the purposes of this suit the
earlier patent must be deemed open to the defendant, and no
damages haiing been proved for the infringement of the improvement under the later patent, considered separately the
inding of the court below was correct.
We do not wish to be understood as expressing an opinion,
whether, if there had been an earlier patent for coupling vessels outstanding at the date of this infringement, and owned

by a third person, defendant could claim that the device described in such patent was open to it. In such case it might
perhaps be held that the plaintiff was entitled to stand upon
the przma facme validity of the earlier patent, and that presumptively the defendant would be bound to pay a royalty to
the patentee, and, having elected to make use of the plaintiff's
invention, would be bound to pay a like royalty to him. This
question, however, is not presented in the case under consideration.
The decree of the court below must be
