not being an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, nor found therein,
personal process could not reach him.
Now, this was
a personal privilege or exemption, which it was competent for
the party to waive. The cases of Pollardv Dw ht, 4 Cranch,
421, and Barry v Foyles, 1 Pet. 311, are decisive to show
that, after appearance and plea, the case stands as if the suit
were brought in the usual manner. And the first of these
cases proves that exemption from liability to process, and that
in case of foreign attachment, too, is a personal privilege,
which may be waived, and that appearing and pleading will
produce that waiver." In Lextngton v Butler, 14 Wall. 282,
the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court over a controversy between citizens of different States was sustained in a case removed from the state court, although it was conceded that
the suit could not have been commenced in the first instance
in the Circuit Court. See also Claflin v Commonwealth Zns.
Co., 110 U. S. 81.
Without multiplying authorities on this question, it is obvious that the party who in the first instance appears and pleads
to the merits waives any right to challenge thereafter the
jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the suit has been
brought in the wrong district. Carlotte Nat. Bank v .Morgan, 132 U. S. 141, Fitzgerald Constructwn Co. v. Fitzgerald,

It follows from these considerations that the Circuit Court

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
APPEAL FROM THE CI CIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 185. Argued March 3, 4, 1891.-Decided May 25, 191.

The degree of care required of directors of corporations depends upon the
subject to which it is to be applied, and each case is to be determined In
view of all the circumstances.

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Statement of the Case.
Directors of a corporation are not insurers of the fidelity of the agents
whom they appoint, who become by such appointment agents of the corporation; nor can they be held responsible for losses resulting from the
wrongful acts or omissions of other directors or agents, unless the loss
is a consequence of their own neglect of duty.
A director of a national bank is not precluded from resignation within the
year by the provision in Rev. Stat. ยง 5145 that when elected he shall hold
office for one year, and until his successor is elected.
:Persons who are elected into a board of directors of a national bank, about
which there is no reason to suppose anything wrong, but which becomes
bankrupt in ninety days after their election, are not to be held personally
responsible to the bank because they did not compel an investigation, or
personally conduct an examination.
Directors of a national bank must exercise ordinary care and prudence
in the administration of the affairs of a bank, and this includes something more than officiating as figure-heads. they are entitled under the
law to commit the banking business, as defined, to their duly-authorized
officers, but this does not absolve them from the duty of reasonable
supervision, nor ought they to be permitted to be shielded from liability
because of want of knowledge of wrong-doing, if that ignorance is the
result of gross inattention.
If a director of a national bank is seriously ill, it is within the power of the
other directors to give him leave of absence for a term of one year, instead of requiring him to resign, and if frauds are committed during his
absence and without his knowledge, whereby the bank suffers loss, he is
not responsible for them.
Applying these principles to this case, Hreld, (1) That the defendant Cushing,
having in good faith sold his bank stock and taken proper steps for its
transfer, and orally tendered his resignation as a director to the president of the bank, and ceased to act as such, cannot be held liable for
the consequences of breaches of trust alleged to have been subsequently
thereafterwards committed (2) That Charles T. Colt was guilty of no
want of ordinary care in acting upon the leave of absence given him,
and, having died while absent on that leave, his estate is not liable for
losses alleged to have been incurred during such absence, and with which
he had no affirmative connection. (3) That the defendant Francis T.
Colt, having accepted the. office of director, when in infirm health, there
being at the time others of the board of directors capable of attending
to the concerns of the bank, and by reason pf physical infirmity having
failed to give the attention to the bank's affairs he otherwise would, his
estate is held not liable for passive negligence on his part under all the
circumstances disclosed in evidence: (4) That as no negligence is shown
whereby the alleged losses can be said to have been affirmatively caused
by thbe defendants Johnson and Spaulding, or either of them, they are
not to be held responsible simply because during the short period they
were directors, they did not discover such losses and prevent them.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

-

Smith (subsequently succeeded by Hadley, Hadley by Movius, and Movius by Briggs) exhibited his bill, as receiver
of the First National Bank of Buffalo, in the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Northern District of New York,
on the 4th of May, 1883, against Reuben Porter Lee, Francis E.
Coit, Elbridge Q..Spaulding, William H. Johnson and Thomas
W Cushing, as directors of that bank, and Anne Vought as
executrix of John H. Vought, and Frank S. Coit and Joseph
C. Barnes, as administrators of Charles C. Coit, former directors. Francis E. Coit died pending the suit, and Caroline E.
Coit, executrix, was made a party defendant.
The bill alleged the organization of the bank as a national
banking association under the acts of Congress in that behalf,
that it carried on the business of banking from February 5,
1864, to April 13, 1882, that on the 14th of April, 1882, being
then insolvent, it suspended business under and by direction of
a bank examiner, and that on the 22d of April complainant.
was appointed receiver by the comptroller of the currency,
qualified April 26, and took possession of the bank's books,
records and assets of every description.
That on December 7, 1863, at a preliminary meeting of the
subscribers to the stock of the bank, certain articles of association were duly adopted and executed, a copy of which was
annexed, that these articles remained unchanged, except that.
the number of directors was reduced from nine to five, that
by-laws were adopted by the board of directors December 13,
1863, a copy of which was annexed, and continued unaltered
from thence forward, and that on January 7, 1879, at a meeting of the directors, a resolution was adopted requiring the
directors to meet regularly at the bank once in each month to
look after the affairs of the bank and transact such business as
might come before them. It was further alleged that defendant Lee was a director from January 12, 1877, 'to April 14,
1882, that defendants Spaillding and Johnson were directors
from January 10 until April 14. 1882, "except as the defendant Spaulding was disqualified by the sale of his stock on
April 11, 1882," that defendant Francis E. Coit was a director from May 20, 1881, and so remained, except as disqualified

Statement of the Case.

by the sale of his stock April 11, 1882, that defendant Cushing was ardirector from June 7, 1879, to January 10, 1882, on
which day- his successor was elected, that John H. Vought
was a director from January, 1865, and remained such, except
as he was disqualified by the sale of his stock January 18,
1882, and that Charles T. Coit was elected a director January
11, 1870, and continued to act as such until about December
11, 1881, when he died intestate, and letters of administration
were issued to Frank S. Coit and Joseph 0. Barnes as administrators. It was further averred that from June 7, 1879, to
December 11, 1881, Charles T. Coit was president of the bank
*anddefendant Lee its cashier; that down to about October 3,
1881, Charles T. Coit continued in the active discharge of his
duties as president, and on that day was given a leave of
absence for one year from those duties, and the defendant Lee
was made vice-president and placed in charge of the bank,
that Lee also continued to be cashier and one McKnight was
assistant cashier thereof, and that on January 10, 1882, a
new board of directors was elected consisting of the defendants Spaulding, Johnson, Francis E. Coit, Lee and Vought,
who elected officers for the ensuing year, Lee as president,
Francis E. Coit as vice-president, McKnight as cashier and
one Bogert as assistant cashier. The bill then charged that
down to about October 3, 1881, being the date when the
defendant Lee was made vice-president and placed in charge
of the bank, "the said bank was solvent and engaged in a
prosperous business, that the capital stock of said bank was
one hundred thousand dollars, which was entirely paid up,
and was divided into shares of the par value of one hundred
dollars each, and that said shares were then saleable at not less
than one hundred and fifty dollars each, and were actually
worth about that sum, that from the time of its organization
down to said last-mentioned date the said bank had declared
and paid dividends on its said capital stock, amounting in
the aggregate to upwards of 285 per cent thereon, that said
bank then had a surplus or reserve fund representing undivided profits of said bank amounting nomihally to seventyfour thousand two hundred and seventy-seven dollars and

Statement of the Case.

three cents ($74,277.03), and had actually a large surplus,"
that on April 14, 1882, the bank was largely insolvent, that
its surplus and capital stock had been exhausted, that its
total liabilities to its creditors, not including the amount of its
capital stock, or other liability to its stockholders as such,
amounted to $1J60,763.77, that its assets were nominally not
less than $1,35f,,199.69, not including the liability of the stockholders on their stock, that a large portion of such assets
were utterly worthless, and that the deficiency then existing
in the good assets as compared with its liabilities was not less
than $535,163.42, or about 46 per cent of the liabilities, that
statements of the nominal financial condition of the bank, as
shown by its own books, as of the dates October 3,1881, January 9, 1882, and April 14, 1882, are annexed, but those of
January 9 and April 14 fail to show that "any of the bills discounted or cash items, as therein stated, were worthless or uncollectible, or that the said bank had suffered any considerable
loss by reason of bad debts or wasteful management, contrary
to the facts as hereinbefore and hereinafter stated." The bill
further averred that the greater part of the losses of the bank
during the period between October 3, 1881, and April 14,
1882, and the consequent failure of the bank, were due to the
misconduct of the officers and directors of the bank, and to
the failure of the directors to perform faithfully and diligently
the duties of their office, and it was particularly alleged that
it was the duty of the directors, "by reason of the nature of
their office and of the principles of the common law applicable
thereto, and under and by virtue of the provisions of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, and of the acts of Congress relating to national banks, and of the articles of association and by-laws of the said bank, hereinbefore referred to,
diligently, carefully and honestly to administer the affairs of
the said bank, to employ none but honest and competent persons to serve as officers of the said bank, to take from all
persons so employed sufficient .security for the faithful performance of their duties, to keep correct books of account of
all the affairs, business and transactions of the said lbank, to
see that the business of the said bank was prudently con-

BRIGGS v.. SPAULDING.
Statement of the Case.

ducted, and that the property and effects of the said bank
were not wasted, stolen or squandered," etc., etc.
It was then charged that the directors utterly failed to perform each and every of their official duties, and during all the
period from October 3, 1881, to April 14, 1882, paid no attention to the affairs of the bank; failed to hold or call meetings,
or to appoint any committee of examination, or to require
bonds, or to make personal examinations 'into the conduct
and management of its affairs and into the condition of its
accounts, but allowed the executive officers to manage it
without supervision.
The bill further charged- that the defendants permitted the
reserve of the bank to remain below the amount required by
Rev Stat. ยง 5191, and that a large part of the losses of the bank
arose from the unlawful extension of its line of discounts, and
-would have been prevented if the directors had performed
their duty and prevented the increase, that on or about
November 7, 1881, the surplus and undivided profits had been
exhausted and the capital stock impaired, and this should have
been reported to the Comptroller, whereby the capital would
have been made good, or the said bank would have necessarily
been put into liquidation and further losses thereafter incurred
by continuance of its business would have been stopped.
It was also asserted that, independently of the provisions
of the acts of Congress, the directors were trustees for the
bank, and its stockholders and creditors, and it was their duty
to have ascertained whether the bank had sustained losses
and made known the facts and the general condition of the
bank and the methods of its management, which duties they
neglected and failed to perform, and by reason thereof the
bank sustained great losses, amounting in the aggregate to at
least $685,163.42.
It was further alleged that it was unlawful for the bank to
allow any one person, company, corporation or firm to become indebted to an amount exceeding one-tenth of the capital stock, excepting by a discount of bills of exchange drawn
in good faith and of business or commercial paper actually
owned by the person negotiating it, but that the directors

Statement of the Case.

from October 3, 1881, to April 14, 1882, permitted this to be
done, and thereby a loss of at least $556,215.62 was occasioned, that it was the duty of the directors and officers of
the bank to make accurate reports to the comptroller, and
they did October 1, 1881, submit a report, and on December
31, 1881, and March 11, 1882, further reports, but the reports
.dated December 31, 1881, and March 11, 1882, were false and
misleading, and particularly in representing that the bank ha.
a surplus fund and undivided profits amounting to large sums.
and an unimpaired) capital, and failing in any way to show
that the bank had sustained heavy losses, whereas the bank
had not at leither of the dates any surplus or undivided profits,
and its capital stock was exhausted or largely imp&ired on
December 31, 1881, and on M5arch 11, 1882, entirely exhausted,
by reason of improvident and careless management, etc., that,
by reason of the false and misleading character of the reports.
the comptroller and stockholders and creditors of the bank
were not informed of its actual condition, and failed to take
steps tor repair the losses or put the bank in liquidation, by
reason of which the bank incurred further losses. And further, that it was the-duty of the directors who were such from
October 3, 1881, to April 14,. 1882, to appoint only honest,
faithful, trustworthy, experienced and competent persons as
officers of the bank, and to reqnire bond or other security, and
remove them if they were incompetent or untrustworthy in
the performance of their duties, that during all that period
of time the directors then in office elected and appointed to,
.-the positions of president, vice-president, and cashier, persons
who were unfit, untrustworthy, incompetent and unfaithful,
and more particularly in the appointment of Lee as.vice-president and president, McKnmght and Bogert being mere clerks
of the bank and subject absolutely to the control and ditection
of Lee, that Francis E. Coit never actually assumed or performed any of the duties properly appertaining to the office
off.vioe-president, and was of no value to the bank as one of its
executive officers; that by reason of the foregoing Lee was.
during all the period -from October 3, 1881, down to the stoppage of the bank, in absolute, control thereof, without any

Statement of the Case.

check, oversight or supervision whatever, which fact was at
all times known to the directors of the bank; that Lee was a
person of inconsiderable financial responsibility and of insufficient age and experience to qualify him for the position, and.
it was an act of gross negligence on the part of the directors
to trust the entire management of the bank, or even the
proper performancp of the duties of president, to Lee, that
under Lee's management the line of discounts was increased
by lending large sums of money on accommodation paper to
Lee personally and to members of his family and his personal
friends, and to other persons with whom the said Lee was.
engaged in speculations, all of whom were of little or no
financial responsibility, many of the loans being in excess of
the amount allowed by the acts of Congress; that lee failed
to take sufficient security for the loans, and in many cases
none at all, that Lee himself borrowed large sums of money
upon his own notes and by overdrawing his account, and an
examination of the books would have disclosed the fact, and
that Lee was lending the funds of the bank to individuals
of insufficient responsibility, and otherwise improperly managing the affairs of the bank and demonstrating his unfitness
for the position, and transactions with one Hall were set f6rth
at length, and other improvident transactions, and it was
charged that by reason of Lee's reckless, improvident and
criminal conduct, the 'bank "which had been solvent and in
a fair financial condition on the said 3d day of October, 1881,
became insolvent and was compelled to go into liquidation on
the 14th day of April, 1882, as hereinbefore alleged;" that all
of his acts in effecting the loans appeared on the books and
might have been discovered by the directors by a proper examination, and it was owing to their negligence and inattention
to duty that Lee was permitted to continue in office and to
continue his mismanagement of the bank's affairs until it had
become insolvent, therefore, the complainant insisted that the
directors were responsible for all losses sustained by the bank
through the negligence and wrongful conduct- of Lee.
It was further alleged that on January 18, 1882, Vought
sold his stock in the bank, and that Spaulding and Francis E.

subjected by reason of the negligence, inattention to 'duty aiid
wrongful acts of the directors to a loss equal to double the
amount of the par value of .their shares of stock together with
the amount of their proportionate interest in the surplus and undivided profits, which their respective interests in the stock of
the bank would have brought them if the bank "had continued
in the condition in which it was on the said 3d day of October,

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Statement of the Case.

The defence was set up on behalf of Charles T. Coit that he
could not be held responsible from October 3 to December 11,
1881, when he died, because of his ill health and absence on
the leave granted to him on October 3, and it was insisted on
behalf of Francis E. Coit that he should be excused for failure
to attend to the business of the bank by reason of his ill health,
so far as he did not attend to it, if responsible at all.
The same defence was made on behalf of Johnson, with the
added fact of serious illness in his family, and the age and practical retirement from business of Mr. Spaulding-were also set forth.
All denied any intentional wrong-doing, or omission of duty,
or legal responsibility for the losses. All asserted their confidence in Lee's capacity and integrity and. their belief in the
sound financial condition of the bank. All denied any neglect
of duty in the premises, and it was denied that any special
losses occurred from January 10, 1882, to the stoppage of the
banK , and asserted on behalf of Spaulding and Francis E.
Coit that if any loss happened between the 11th of April and
the 14th they could not be held responsible under the bill as
framed, as they had-parted with their stock and thereby ceased
to be directors.
Voluminous evidence was taken and upon the hearing of the
cause the bill was dismissed as to defendants Spauld'ing, Johnson
and Caroline E. Coitt executrix, without costs, and as to defendants Cushing and the administrators of Charles T. Coit, with
costs.

From this decree an appeal was prosecuted to this court.
The opinion of the Circuit Court will be found in .Iowus v.
Zee, 30 Fed. Rep. 98.
The Circuit Court held that defendant Cushing ceased to be
a director of the bank prior to the occurrence of the losses as
alleged and owed no duty in that behalf, and that Charles T.
Coit's absence on leave from October 3, 1881, to his death,
December 11, 1881, exonerated him, and that defendants
Spaulding, Johnson and Francis E. Coit were not liable under
the statute, because they did not come within its provisions,
nor by the common, law, for by that each was liable only for
his own miscarriages and none were shown.

MR. CHI.F JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion lof the court.
In the language of appellant's counsel, the bill was framed
upon -the theory of a breach by the defendants as directors
"of their common law duties as trustees of a financial corporation and of breaches of special restrictions and obligations of
the national banking act."
And it is claimed that the defendants should have been held
liable for the losses whiah occurred through loans of the bank's
'funds and moneys during their term of office as directors, to
Lee, his father, his wife and certain designated persons, which
were the principal losses, though there were others smaller in
amount for which they were responsible.
This liability is alleged to have been incurred by Lee for all
loans from October 3, 1881, until April 14, 1882, by F E.
Ooit for all loss-es througi the mismanagement of the bank
from October 3, 1881, until April 14, 1882, which could have
been prevented by rea:sonable diligence and care on .the part
ofthe directors, by John H. Vought on the same basis and
for the same time, by Charles T. Coit from October 3 to
December 11, 1881, by Cushing from October 3, 1881, to
January 10, 1882, unless-liis liability terminated with the
-transfer of his stock on the books of the bank, by Spaulding
and Johnson from January 10 to April 14, 1882.
it is contended, as an independent proposition, that each of
the defendantg should have been held liable for all'loans made
during the periods before mentioned when the loans exceeded
ten per cent of the capital of the bank, in violation of Rev

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Opinion of the Court.

Stat. ยง 5200, and also for all loans made while the bank's
reserve was below fifteen per cent of its deposits, in violation
of Rev Stat. ยง 5191, where such loans resulted in losses.
And finally, that each of the defendants should have been
'held absolutely liable for all losses of the bank incurred by
carrying on its business after its capital became impaired or
exhausted and the bank insolvent.
Under Rev Stat. ยง 5136, national banking associations
were empowered "Fifth. To elect or appoint directors, and
by its board of directors, to appoint a president, vice-president,
cashier and other officers, define their duties, require bonds of
them and fix the penalty thereof, dismiss such officers or any
-of them at pleasure, and appoint others to fill their places.
Sixth. To prescribe, by its board of directors, by-laws not
inconsistent with law, regulating the manner in .which its
stock shall Jbe transferred, its directors elected or appointed, its
officers appointed, its property transferred, its general business
conducted and the privileges granted to it by law exercised and
enjoyed. Seventh. To exercise by.its board of directors, or
duly-authorized officers or agents, "sdbject to law, all such inci-dentalpowers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of
banking, by diseunting and negotiating promissory notes,
drafts, bills of exchange and other evidences of debt, by receiving deposits, by.buying and selling exchange, coin and bullion, by loaning money on personal security; and by obtaining, issuing and circulating notes pccording to the provisions
of this title."
By section 5145, hP affairs of each association were to be
managed by not less thai" lve dlrectors, to be elected at meetings to be held in I)nuary,,and to hold office for one year and
until their successors were elected .and had qualified, and by
section 5146,_every, director was! obliged to own in his own
right at leadt ten sbar.es:of the gapital stock, and if he ceased
to own the required nuniber of phares or became in any other
manner disqualified, h thereby vabated his place. By section
5148, any vacancy in the board was to be -filled by"an appointment by the Vem ining directors, and any director so appointed
held his placet until the next election.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

Section 5147 provided that. "Each director, when appointed
or elected, shall take an oath that he will, so far as the duty
devolves on him, diligently and.honestly administer the affairs
of such association, and will not knowingly violate, or willingly
permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this title, and
that he is the owner in good faith, and in his own right, of
the number of shares of stock required by this title," etc.
By section 5211, every bank was -required to make not less
than five reports during each year, under the oath of the president or cashier, and attested by at least three of the directors,
exhibiting in detail the resources and liabilities of the bank,
and the coinptroller could call for special reports.
Under section 5240, the appointment of bank examiners was
provided for, with power to make thorough examination into
the affairs of any bank, and in doing so to examine any of the
officers and agents on oath, and make a full and detailed report
to the comptroller.
Section 5239 is in these words "If the directors of any
national banking association shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit any of the officers, agents or servants of the
association to violate any of the provisions of this title, all the.
rights, privileges 'and franchises of the association shall be
thereby forfeited. Such violation shall, however, be determined and adjudged by a proper circuit, district or territorial
court of the United States, in a suit brought for that purpose
by the comptroller of the currency, in his own name, before
the association shall be declared dissolved. And in cases of
such violation, every director who participated in or assented
to the same shall be held liable in his personal and individual
capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders
or any other person, shall have sustained in consequence of
such violation."
When the banking act was originally passed and this bank
was organized that which is now subdivision seven of section
5136 did not contain the words "or duly authorized officers or
agents, subject to law," that is, the original act provided that
the board of directors might exercise all such incidental powers
as should be necessary to carry on the business of banking, as

Opinion of the Court.

there specified, but said nothing about the exercise of those
powers by the bank officers or agents. The words were
inserted in the Revised Statutes, 1873, 1874.
The articles of association of the P rst National Bank of
Buffalo were framed under Rev Stat. ยง 5133, and provided for
an annual meeting of the stockholders; that the board of
directors should appoint a president, cashier and such other
officers and clerks as might be required to transact the business of the association and define their respective duties, and
by their by-laws specify by what officers of the association or
committee of the board the regular banking business of the
association should be conducted, and empowered the board of
directors to require bonds of the officers. The by-laws of the
institution were adopted December 13, 1863, and had relation
to the then powers of the board of directors. By section 13 a
standing committee was provided for, to be known as the exchange committee, consisting of the president and three directors, appointed by the board every six months, which had
power to discount bills, notes, etc., and was required to report
at the regular board meetings. Under section 19 a committee
was to be appointed every three months to examine into the
affairs of the bank and report to the board. Regular meetings were required to be held monthly It is alleged that on
the 7th of January, 1879, the board requested itself to meet
thereafter regularly on the first of every month, "to look after
the affairs of the bank," etc.
It appears that the provisions of the by-laws were not observed, at least after the amendment in sub-section 7, ยง 5136,
and that the management of the bank was left almost entirely
to the officers. No exchange committee nor examination committee was appointed, and the meetings of the board were
infrequent and perfunctory For years prior to the failure,
fourteen at least, the business of the bank had been conducted
by the president.
It is not contended that the defendants knowingly violated,
or permitted the violation of, any of the provisions of the
banking act, or that they were guilty of any dishonesty in
administering the affairs of the bank, but it is charged that

they did not diligently perform duties devolved upon them by
the act.
Our attention has not been called, however, to any duty
specifically imposed upon the directors as individuals by the
terms of the act, although if any director participated in or
assented to any violation of the law by the board he would be
individually liable. The corporation after the amendment of
1874 had power to carry on its business through its officers.
And although no formal resolution authorized the president to
transact the business, yet in view of the practice of fourteen
years or more, we think it must be held that he was duly
authorized to do so. It does not -follow that the executive
officers should have been left to control the business of the
bank absolutely and without supervision, or that the statute
furnishes a justification for the pursuit of that course.' Its
language does enable individual directors to say that they
were guilty of no violation of a duty directly devolved upon
them. Whether they were responsible for any neglect of the
board as such, or in failing to obtain proper action on its part,
is another question. Indeed, it is frankly stated by counsel
that "although special provisions of the statute are quoted
and relied upon, these do not create the cause of action, but
merely furnish the standard of duty and the evidence of
wrong-doing;" and section 556 of Morawetz on Corporations
is cited, which is to the effect that "the liability of directors
for damages caused by acts expressly prohibited by the company's charter or act of incorporation is not created by force
of the statutory prohibition. The performance of acts which
are illegal or prohibited by law may subject the corporation
to a forfeiture of its franchises, and the directors to criminal
liability; but this would not render them civilly liable for
damages. The liability of directors to the corporation for
damages caused by unauthorized acts rests upon the common
law rule which renders every agent liable who violates his
authority to the damage of his principal. A statutory prohibition is material under these circumstances merely as indicating an express restriction placed upon the powers delegated
to the directors when the corporation was formed."

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Opinion of the Court.

It is perhaps unnecessary to attempt to define with precision the degree of care and prudence which directors must
exercise in the performance of their duties. The degree of
care required depends upon the subject to which it is to be
applied, and each case has to be determined in view of all the
circumstances. They are not insurers of the fidelity of the
agents whom they have appointed, who are not their agents
but the agents of the corporation, and they, cannot be -held
responsible for losses resulting from the wrongful acts or omissions of other directors or agents, uilless the loss is a consequence of their own neglect of duty, either for failure to
supervise the business with attention or in neglecting to use
proper care in the appointment of agents. Morawetz, % 551
-et seq., and cases.
Bank directors are often styled trustees, but not in any techical sense. The relation between the corporation anki them is
rather that of principal and agent, certainly so far as creditors
are concerned, between whom and the corporation the relation
is that of contract and not of trust. But, undoubtedly, under
circumstances, they may be treated as occupying the position
of trustees to cesuz que trust.
In Percy v ZfXillaudon, 8 Martin, (1. S.) 68, *74,75, which
has been cited as a leading case for more than sixty years, the
Supreme Court of Louisiana, through Judge Porter, declared
that the correct mode of ascertaining whether an agent is in
fault "is by inquiring whether he neglected the exercise of
that diligence and care, which was necessary to a successful
discharge of the duty imposed on him. That diligence and
care must again depend on the nature of the undertaking.
There are many things which, in their management, require
the utmost diligence, and most scrupulous attention, and
where the agent who underitakes them direction, renders himself responsible for the slightest neglect. There are others,
where the dutiesimposed are presumed to call for nothing
more than ordinary care and attention, and where the exercise
of that degree of care suffices. The directors of banks, from
the nature of their undertaking, fall within the class last
mentioned, while in the -discharge of their ordinary duties. It

isnot contemplated by any of the charters, which have come
under our observation, and it was not by that of the Planter's
Bank, that 'they should devote their whole time and attention
to the institution to which they are appointed, and guard it
from in.jury by constant superintendence. Other officers on
whom compensation is bestowed for the employment of their
time in the affairs of the bank, have the immediate management. In relation to these officers, the duties of directors are
those of control, and the neglect which would render them
responsible for not exercising that control properly, must depend on circumstances, and in a great measure be- tested by
the facts of the case. If nothing has come to their knowledge,
to awaken suspicion of the fidelity of the president and cashier,
ordinary attention to the affairs of the institution is sufficient.
If they become acquainted with any fact calculated to put
prudent men on -their guard, a degree of care commensurate
with the evil to be avoided is required, and a want of that
care certainly makes them responsible."
8perzng's Appeal, 71 Penn. St. 11, 20, was the case of a bill
filed by Spering, as assignee of a trust company, against its
directors and others, to compel them to make good losses sustained by the depositors on the ground of fraudulent mismanagement of the affairs of the company And Judge Sharswood,
speaking for the court, said "It is by no means a well-settled
point what is the precise relation which directors sustain to
stockholders. They are, undoubtedly, said in many authorities to be trustees, but that, as I apprehend, is only in a general sense, as we term an agent or any other bailee entrusted
with the care and management of the property of another. It
is certain that they are not technical trustees. They can only
be regarded as mandataries -persons who have gratuitously
undertaken to perform ,certain duties, and who are therefore
bound to apply ordinary skill and diligence, but no more.
We are dealing now with their responsibility to stockholders, not to outside parties reditors and depositors. It
is unnecessary to consider what the rule may be as to them.
Upon a close examination of all the reported cases, although
'there are many dicta not easily reconcilable, yet I have found

no judgment or decree which has held directors to account,
except when they have themselves been personally guilty of

at some fraud in others, or where such fraud might have been

It was in this aspect that Lord iHatherley remarked in land
,CreditCompany v Fermoy,L. R. 5 Ch. 763, 772 "Whatever
may be the case with a trustee, a director cannot be held liable
for being defrauded, to do so would 'make his position intolerable." And the same view is expressed by Sir George Jessel,
M . R., in his opinion in In re Forest of Dean Coal .Ain2.ng
Co., 10 Oh. D. 450, 451, where he says "One must be very
cafeful in administering.the law of joint-stock companies not
to press so bard on honest directors as to make them liable for
these constructive defaults, the only effect of which would be
to deter all men of any property, and perhaps all- men who
have any character -to lose, from becoming directors of companies at all On the one hand, I think the court should do
its utmost to bring fraudulent directors to account, and, on
the other hand, should also do its best to allow honest men to
act reasonably as directors. Wilful defaul4 no doubt, includes
the case of a trustee neglecting to sue, though he might by
suing earlier have recovered a trust fund - in that case he is
made liable for want of due diligence in his trust. But I think
4directors are not liable on the same principle."
The theory of this bill is that the defendants are liable, not

to stockholder nor to creditors, as such, but to the bank for
losses alleged to have occurred during their period of office,
because of their inattention.
If particular stockholders or creditors have a cause of
action against the defendants individually, it is not sought ta
be proceeded on here, and the disposition of the questions
arising thereon would depend upon different considerations.
In Preston v. Prather,137 U. S. 6041, 608, it was ruled that.
gratuitous bailees of another's property are not responsible for
its loss unless guilty of gross negligence in its keeping, and
whether that negligence existed or not is a question of fact for
a jury to determine, or to be iletermined by the court where a,
jury is waived. And, further, that the reasonable care which
the bailee of another's property entrusted to him for safe-keeping, without reward must take, varies with the nature, value
and situation of the property, and the bearing of surrounding
circumstances on its security That was a case of persons,
engaged in the business of banking, receiving for safe-keeping
a parcel containing bonds, which was put in their vaults.
They were notified that their assistant cashier, who had free
access to the vaults where the bonds were deposited, and wh&
was a person of scant means, was engaged in speculations in
stocks. They' made no examination of the securities deposited
with them, and did not remove the cashier. He stole the bonds
so deposited, and it was held that the bankers were guilty of
gross negligence, and were liable to the owner of the bonds
for their value at the time they were stolen. And Mr. Justice
Field, delivering the opinion said "Undoubtedly if the bonds
were received for safe-keeping, without compensation to them
in any form, but exclusively for the benefit of the plaintiffs,
the only obligation resting upon them was to exercise over the
bonds such reasonable care as men of common prudence would
usually bestow for the protection of their own property of a
similar character. No one taking upon himsea a duty for
another without consideration is bound, either in law or morals,
to do more than a man of that character would do generally
for himself under like conditions."
No one of the defendants is charged with the misappropriation

Opinion of the Court.

or misapplication of, or interference with, any property of the
bank, nor with carelessness in respect to any particular property but with the omission of duty, which, if performed,
would have prevented certain specified losses, in respect of
which complainant seeks to charge them.
The doctrine that one trustee is not liable for the acts or
defaults of his cotrustees, and while, if he remains merely
passive and does not obstruct the collection by a cotrustee of
moneys, is not liable for waste, is conceded, but it is argued
that if he himself receives the funds, and either delivers them
over to his associate, or does any act by which they come into
the possession of the latter or under his control, and but for
which he would not have received them, such trustee is liable for any. loss resulting from the waste, Bruen v Gillet,
115 l\. Y 10, Pomeroy Eq. Jur. ยงยง 1069, 1081, and that this
case comes within the rule as thus qualified.
LTreated as a cause of action in favor of the corporation, a
liability of this kind should not lightly be imposed in the
absence of any element of positive misfeasance, and solely
upon the ground of passive negligence, and it must be made
to appear that the losses for which defendants are required to
respond were the natural and necessary consequence of oission on their part.
And in this connection the remarks of Mr. Justice Bradley
in Railroad Co. v -Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 382, may well be
quoted "We have already adverted to the tendency of
judicial opinion adverse to the distinction between gross and
ordinary negligence. Strictly speaking, these expressions are
indicative rather of the degree of care and diligence which is
due from a party and which he fails to perform, than of the
amount of inattentibn, carelessness or stupidity whioh he
exhibits. If very little care is due from him, and he fails to
bestow that little, it is called gross negligence. If very great
care is due, and he fails to come up to the mark required, it is
called slight negligence. And if ordinary care is due, such as
a prudent man would exercise in his own affairs, failure-to
bestow that amount of care is called ordinary negligence. In
each case the negligence, whatever epithet we give it, is fail-

modern authorities. If they mean more than this, and seek
to abolish the distinction of degrees of care, skill and diligence required in the performance of various duties and the
fulfilment of various contracts, we think they go too far,
since the requirement of different degrees of care in different
situations is too firmly settled and fixed in the law to be
ignored or changed."
In any view the degree of care to which these defendants
were bound is that which ordinarily prudent and diligent men
would exercise under similar circumstances, and in determining that the restrictions of the statute and the usages of business should be taken into account. What may be negligence
in one case ma.y not be want of ordinary care in another, and
the question of negligence is, therefore, ultimately a question
of fact, to be determined under all the circumstances.
The alleged liability of the defendants is such that the facts
must be examined as to each of them.
As to the defendant Cushing, the evidence establishes that
on the 21th of September, 1881, he resigned his office as a
director of the bank verbally to Charles T. Coit, the then
president, and on that day sold to Mr. Coit the ten shares of
the capital stock of which he was the owner. The books of
the bank show the sale and transfer as of September 24, 1881,
but the certificate and power of attorney authorizing the
transfbr were apparently not delivered until October [, when
the money was paid, being $125 per share. According to the
recollection of Lee, the entry in the transfer book was not
made until November, when he thinks the stock was sent up
to him by Mr. Coit from New York city, but he was informed
of Mr. Cushing's resignation of his position as director on
October 3, 1881, by Mr. Coit, who was then president of the
bank. This was brought out upon cross-examination, after
complainant had examined Lee in chief in relation to Cushing's resignation and the vacancy created by the transfer of
his stock. Cushing testified that the transfer was made on

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Opinion of the Court.

September 24, 1881, and we cannot hold that the Circuit Court
erred in concluding that that testimony, coupled with the evidence of the record, outweighed the testimony of Lee, which
was, indeed, of minor importance if the resignation had taken
effect as stated. It is objected that the evidence of Cushing
was incompetent, but we do not find that this objection was
made when Cushing was examined and cross-examined as a
witness. Nor do we think the evidence incompetent as
against complainant. Rev Stat. ยง 853, N. Y Code Civ Proc.
ยง 829, 2fonongahela, Bank v Jacobus, 109 U. S. 275, Snyder

In TFhitney v. Butler, 118 U. S. 655, 662, it was held that
where stock had been sold, and the certificate, with power of
attorney for transfer duly executed in blank, delivered to the
president of the bank, the responsibility of the original stockholder terminated. And Mr. Justice Harlan said for the
court, "It was suggested in argument that the defendants
should have seen that the transfer was made. But we were
not told precisely what ought to have been done to this end
that was not done by them and their agents. Had anything
occurred that would have justified the defendants in believing,
or even in suspecting, that the transfer hai not been promptly
made on the books of the bank, they would, perhaps, have
been wanting in due diligence had they not, by inspection of
the bank's stock register, ascertained whether the proper
tran'fer had in fact been made. But there was nothing to
justify such a belief or to excite such a suspicion. Their conduct was under all the circumstances, that of careful, prudent,
business men, and it would be a harsh interpretation of their
acts to hold (in the language in some of the cases, when considering the general question under a different state of fact)
that they allowed or permitted the name of Whitney to remain on the stock register as a shareholder. We are of opinion that, within a reasonable construction of the statute, and
for all the objects intended to be accomplished by the provision imposing liability upon shareholders for the debts of national banks, the responsibility of the defendants must be held
to have ceased upon the surrender of the certificates to the

bank and the delivery to its president of a power of attorney
sufficient to effect, and intended to effect, as that officer knew,
a transfer of the stock, on the books of the association, to the
purchaser." Tested by this rule the conclusion of the Circuit
Court on the matter was correct.
The resignation was orally tendered to the president, and
manifestly accepted by him, since the sale of the stock was
made at the same time, and the president informed the cashier
of the fact a few days afterwards. Putting a resignation in
writing is the more orderly and proper mode of procedure,
but if the fact exists, and is adequately proven, the result is
necessarily the same, as applied to this case. We do not understand that because- Section 5145 of the Revised Statutes
provides that directors shall hold office for one year and until
their successors have been elected and have qualified, this pro-.
hibits resignations during the year, and whiie the banking
law is silent as to the time when and the method by which the
office of director may be resigned, we think that leaves it as at,
common law, and that this resignation was effective. Rex v

Having sold his stock September 24 and resigned his position, Mr. Cushing did not thereafter act as a director, and was
not present at the meetings of October 3 and December 17.,
1881, and January 10, 1882.
The bill alleges that the bank was entirely solvent on October 3, and engaged in a prosperous business with a large surplus, the shares commanding a- premium of fifty per cent.
Upon this question there was no issue made as between complainant and Cushing, and while, as hereafter stated, we believe the bank to have been hopelessly insolvent at that date,
the case must be determined upon the allegations of the bill,
and therq is nothing in the record to cast the least suspicion
upon the good faith of the transaction. There is no charge of
breach of trust prior to the resignation and sale, and the
decree as to Cushing must be affirmed.

BRIGGS v. SPAULDING.
Opinion of the Court.

Charles T. Coit had been the first cashier of the bank and
was elected a director in 1870. He was its president from
June, 1879, to the date of his death on December 11, 1881. On
October 3, 1881, a meeting of the board of directors was held,
at which Charles T. Coit, Francis E. Coit, Vought and Lee were
present. Cushing, who had resigned on the 24th of September, was absent. It appears that at this meeting a resolution
was adopted giving Charles T. Coit, the president, a leave of
absence, on account of ill health, for one year. No one was
elected president prior to January 10, 1882, in his place.
There is no doubt of the severity of his illness and the necessity for his absence, but it is contended that the resolution
referred to absence as president and not as director, and that
no power existed to allow leave of absence to a member of the
board, and so that the resolution should be limited to excuse
him from attendance at the bank, but not to permit him to
leave the city, and it is said that if he wished to be absolved
from responsibility while absent in search of restored health,
he should have resigned. If such were the rule, we apprehend
that moneyed corporations would find extreme difficulty in
obtaining proper persons to act as directors. But it is not the
rule. Mr. Coit was guilty of no want of ordinary care in acting upon the leave of absence, and is not to be held because
he did not resign. Invalids are permitted to indulge in the
hope of recovery, and are not called upon by reason of illness
to retire at once from the affairs of this world and confine
themselves to preparation for their passage into another.
There was here no neglectful abandonment of dutyfrom October 3 to December 11, and the decree in favor of the administrators of Charles T. Coit was properly rendered.
We pass, then, to the inquiry as to the liability of defendants Spaulding and Johnson. In what did their negligence
consist, and were losses occasioned by that negligence, and
what losses 2 Their conduct is to be judged not by the event,
but by the circumstances under which they acted.

and had a line of discounts there. When requested by Lee in
December, 1881, to fill one of the vacancies created by the
resignation of Cushing and the death of Charles T. Coit, he
objected to doing so, on the ground of want of knowledge of
the banking business, and the fact that the nature of his own
business carried him away considerably from the city, but
finally, upon being informed that the bank was in prosperous
condition and that much of his time would not be required,
accepted. After the 10th of January he was in the bank from
time to time, and inquired about its business, and was told by
Lee that everything was going, on well. At Lee's request he
signed the report of March 11, 1882, which had been sworn to
by the cashier, and signed by Francis E. Coit before Johnson
signed it. He was informed that the report contained a correct exhibit of the condition of, the bank as shown by its
books, and Lee testified that it did, and that if incorrect the
error could not- have been detected by an examnation of the
books and papers of the bank. Very soon after the 10th of
January, -is. Johnson became 'perilously ill, and Johnson,
through the extra strain put upon him, fell himself into such
a physical and mental condition as incapacitated him from
properly attending to business.
Spaulding had had a large and various experience and, as a
member of Congress, drafted the original national banking
act, was president of a leading bank and connected with several financial corporations, and testified that the practice of
banks, so far as he knew, all over the country, was to a large
extent to carry on the business through their executive officers,
especially where these officers held a majority of the stock,
that when he purchased his stock he believed this bank was
being conducted by its duly-authorized officers, and his judgment was that his duty as a director was discharged if he
attended the meetings to which he was summoned, performed
such duties as were specifically required of him and gave such
advice as was asked from him, that his summers were spent
upon his farm in the country; that in 1882 he was seventytwo years of age, that he was in a measure retired from business, so that he gave very little attention to the affairs of his

Opinion of the Court.

own bank, but was ready to give any advice or suggestions
when called upon for that purpose upon any special matters,
that for many years it had been the practice in the corporations in which he was a director to treat him as an advisory
director, and not as a director occupied in the daily management of their affairs, and that he accepted the position upon
the understanding that he should occupy this relation.
He set forth in his answer, which was made under oath as
required by the bill, and which was, therefore, evidence, that
it was well known to the stockholders and most other persons
dealing with the bank that he had retired from active pursuits, and that it was only expected of him -by the stockholders
and the depositors of the bank that he should more especially
perform such duties as he should be specifically required to
perform by its board of directors and officers, and that he
should impart such adince in its management as he should be
asked to give in the course of its business.
Re further stated that he never received or expected to
receive any compensation or benefit from the bank as a director, that Lee was the owner of a large majority of the stock,
that, as is customary, in such cases, Lee had assumed; to a
large extent, the management and control of the bank, with
the knowledge of the other directors and with the knowledge
of the stockholders of the bank, and most, if not all, of the
depositors therein, and upon information and belief "that
long Wfore he became a stockholder of said bank, and up to
the time he became such stockholder, and while he was such
stockholder, it was understooa by all persons having dealings
with the said bank that the said Lee practically administered
the affairs thereof, as its chief executive officer."

familiar with the fact that the business of the bank was conducted, so far as its discounts and other banking business was
concerned, without the intervention of the board of directors,
or a committee of that board.
Mr. Spaulding further testified that he never received any
notice to attend directors' meetings, that he had no actual

Opinion of the Court.

'knowledge of the by-laws, that he was not appointed on any
committee or requested to perform any duty, that he-supposed
the bank was in a prosperous condition down to the day of its
failure, that he had confidence in Lee's capacity and integrity, and that the business of the bank was being conducted
safely and prosperously under his management, that he talked
with Lee in regard to the affairs of the bank, who told him
the bank was in good condition, that he examined the reports
made to the comptroller, December 31, 1881, and March 11,
1882, and saw by them that everything was going right, and
that he knew the duty of makMg an examination had not
been devolved upon him, and further stated that it would
have taken a month to have ascertained whether the reports
to the comptroller were correct, and that it was the duty of
the comptroller and the bank examiner to do so.
The evidence fairly establishes that this bank was in good
credit up to the time of its failure. It had been in existence
for eighteen years, had been prosperous, had paid dividends
regularly, down to and into 1881, and its stock had for years
stood far above par, at fifty per cent above, October 3, 1881,
according to complainant. Neither the defendants, nor the
bank's customers, nor the community, appear to have entertained the least suspicion as to its solvency The losses which
it is claimed rendered it insolvent, and for the recovery of
which losses this action was instituted, occurred by reason of
the discounting by Lee of the paper of persons engaged with
him in outside business and speculations, who were not adequately responsible for their engagements. The vice in the
situation lay, not in the reports nor in the books, upon their
face, but in-the unreliability of the bills receivable.
Were these defendants guilty of negligence in allowing Lee
to remain in charge of the bank? Would they have been. so
guilty if they had: put him in charge for the first time on the
10th of January ?
It appears that Lee went into the employment of this bank
in 1868, being then eighteen years old and so remained until
April 14, 1882, occupying in succession the positions of messenger boy, book-keeper, teller, assistant cashier, cashier, vice-

president and president. He was the son of an old- and
well-known citizen of Buffalo, a graduate of its high school,
was or had been one of the trustees and treasurer of a leading
church in Buffalo, treasurer of the Young Men's Christian
Association, and a member of the Young Men's Association.
His general character was good, his reputation for integrity
and financial capacity excellent, and he possessed the confi4ence of his fellow-citizens. Upon the 10th of January, 1882,
he was the owner of two-thirds of the stock of the bank, and
had apparently a greater interest than any other person in
seeing that its affairs wore so managed that its capital would
remain unimpaired. The business of the bank had been con*ducted for years by the president, assisted by the other executive officers, and it bad seemingly been well conducted. Lee
was selected to assurae the management when Charles T. Colt
retired in October, 1881, by the then board of directors, and
there was nothing to indicate that the choice was not a proper
and fit one. We think no jury would have been justified in
finding defendants guilty of negligence in retaining Lee in
-the management of the bank. Nor was there any violation
of law in permitting him to conduct its business, for he was
duly authorized to do so under the provisions of the act.
We do not mean that this dispensed with reasonable oversight
by the directors, but that belongs to a different branch of
inquiry
Biut it is contended that defendants should have insisted on
meetings of the board of directors or had special meetings
called, and at those meetings or otherwise made personal
examinatioL into the affairs of the bank, and that had thpy
done this they would have discovered the condition of the
bank and prevented losses occurring subsequently to the 10Vk
of January
Here, again, it should be observed that even trustees are
not liable for the wrongful acts of their co-trustees unless
they connive at them or are guilty of negligence conducive

had been left wholly with the president and cashier, and that
from the 10th of January to the stoppage of the bank the
business was done as it had always been done. No bonds had
been required of the officers for at least fourteen years, no
meetings were held by the board of directors except the
annual meeting and meetings to declare dividends or on some
special occasion, no exchange committee had been appointed
since 1875, and no committees had ever been appointed to
examine into the bank's affairs, question its cashier, or compare its assets and liabilities with the balances on the general
ledger. So that this manner of conducting the business had
been sanctioned by long-continued usage, and the evidence
tends to show that the method pursued must have been and
was well known to many of its customers, including those who
were creditors at the time of its failure, as well as its stockholders. All this was not as it should have been, and ought
not to be countenanced, but the facts have an important bearmg on the question whether Spaulding and Johnson should be
held liable because they did not at once endeavor to change
the entire methods of doing, business and enter upon an
exhaustive investigation of the assets. Would ordinarily prudent and diligent men have done so under similar circumistances? It is not so much a question of holding meetings, as
of examination, searching and thorough, an overhauling of
the bills receivable, and the detection of the uncollectible indebtedness which rendered the bank insolvent. Were Spaulding and Johnson guilty of negligence in that they did not
make such an examination within ninety days after they became directors, in the teeth Qf the assurances of Lee, in whom
they reposed confidence, who had been connected with the
bank for so many years, and who owned two-thirds of the
stock 2
The kind of examination required is indicated by the fact
that-although the evidence leaves it beyond question that the
bank was insolvent on the third of October, 1881, its capital
and surplus wholly exhausted, and losses incurred for thousands of dollars beyond that amount, complainant, after a year's
close investigation, alleges that the bank was at that time

-Opinion of the Court

solvent, engaged in a prosperous business, with an unimpaired
capital and a surplus, and with stock standing at fifty per cent
above par. Indeed, the books and papers of the bank were
kept in such a condition that even the cashier swore that lie
did not suspect anything wrong in the management until
April 10, 1882.
There were, it is true, two transactions in violation of the
provisions of the banking law, not entered on the books, and
to which the learned circuit judge refers. On the 18th of
January, 1882, Lee took $23,680 from the cash of the bank,
which he replaced by a slip of paper with the amount on it in
the cash drawer. This was called a cash item, and was thereafter counted as cash. It was reduced from time to time
until on April 12 it was 812,405. On February 15, he took
$16,737.50 in the same way from the bank's cash and placed
a similar slip in the drawer. This was reduced by April 12 to.
$11,435. These transactions were not concealed from the.
cashier and subordinate officers of the bank, yet, in view of
Lee's position and character, excited no suspicion, and the
,directors were not informed of the facts.
Again, under section 5200 Rev Stat., the total liabilities for
money borrowed to any national banking association of any
-erson, company, etc., should at no time exceed one-tenth part
of the capital stock, but the discount of bills of exchange
drawn in good faith against actually existing values, and of
commercial or business paper actually owned by the person
negotiating the same, is not to be considered as money borrowed. This provision was grossly violated, but while Lee
testified in chief for complainant that the directors could have
ascertained from an examination of the -books, papers and
notes whether or not the loans, which exceeded $10,000, were
for discounts of bills of exchange or business paper, within the
exception, he statea, on cross-examination, that it would not
have been possible, from an inspection of the paper simply, or
an examination of the books of the bank, or both, to have
made the discovery, thus drawing a recognized distinction
between bare inspection and thorough examination, a distinction also applicable to loans when the reserve was below

fifteen per cent of the. deposits, and generally We are imapressed by the evidence with the conviction that a cursory
glance would not have been enough.
Would it not have been the exercise of an extraordinary
degree of care if these defendants had insisted, within the first
ninety days, upon making such an examination?
Certainly it cannot be laid. down as a rule th-at there is an
invariable presumption of rascality as to one's agents in business transactions, and that the degree of watchfulness must be
proportioned to th , presumption.
"I know of no law," said Vice-Ohatcellor McCoun, in Scott
v De Peyster, 1 Edw Oh. 513, 541, "which requires the president or directors of any moneyed institution to adopt a system
of espionage in relation to their secretary or cashier or any
subordinate agent, or to set a watch upon all their actions.
While engaged in the performance of the general duties of
their station, they must be supposed to act honestly until the
contrary appears, and the law does not require their employers to entertain jealousies and suspicions without some
apparent reason. Should any circumstance transpire to
awaken a just suspicion of their want of integrity, and it be
suffered to pass unheeded, a different rule would prevail if a
loss ensued. But, without some fault on the part of the directors, amounting either to negligence or fraud, they cannot be
liable."
Nor is knowledge of what.the books and papers would have
shown to be imputed. In TFakeman v. Dalk2e, 51 N. Y 27,
32, Judgd' Earl observed in .relation to Dalley,, sought to be
charged for false representations in the circular of a company
of which he was one of the directors ."He was simply a director, and as-such attended some f the meetings of the board of
directors. As he was a director, must we impute to him, for
the purpose of charging him with fraud, a knowledge of all
the affairs of the company 2 If the law requires this, then the
position of -a director in any large corporation, like a railroad,
or banking, or isurande company, is one of constant peril.
The affairs of such a company are generally, of necessity,
largely intrusted to managing officers. The directors gen-

erally cannot know, and have not the ability or knowledge
requisite to learn, by their own efforts, the true condition of
the affairs of the company They select agents in whom they
have confidence, and largely trust to them. They publish
their statements and reports, relying upon the figures and
facts furnished by such agents, and if the .directors, when
actually cognizant of no fraud, are to be made liable in an
action of fraud for any error or misstatement in such statements and reports, then we have a rule by which every director is made liable for any fraud that may be committed upon
the company in the abstraction of its assets and diminution
of its capital by any of its agents, and he becomes substantially an insurer of their fidelity It has not been-generally
understood that such a responsibility rested upon the directors
of corporations, and I know of no principle of law or rule of
public policy which requires that it should."
And so Sir George Jessel, in Hallmark's Case, 9 Oh. D. 329,
332 "It is contended that Hallmark, being a director, must
be taken to have known the contents of all the books and
documents of the cQmpany, and so to have known that his
name was on the register of shares for fifty shares. But he
swears that in fact he did not know that any shares had been
allotted.to him. Is knowledge to be imputed to him under
any rule of law 2 As a matter of fact, no one can suppose
that a director of a company knows everything which is entered in the books, and I *te no reason why knowledge should
be imputed to him which he does not possess in fact. Why
should it be his duty to look into the list of shareholders?
I know no case, except Em parte Brown, 19 Beav 97, which
shows that it is the duty of a director to look at the entries
in any of the books, and it would be extending the doctrine
of constructive notice far beyond that or any other case to
impute to this director the knowledge which it is sought to
impute to him in this case."
We are of opinion that these defendants should not be
subjected to liability upon the ground of want of ordinary
care, because they did not compel the board of directors to
make such an investigation and did not themselves individu-

ally conduct an examination, during their short period of service, or because they did not happen to go among the clerks
and look through the books, or call for and run over the bills
receivable.
Of course a thorough examination would have ascertained
that the bank lught to be put into liquidation at once. Noth'.ng that could have.been done on or after the 10th of January
would have saved it. Insolvent on the 3d of October, its gondition had changed for the worse January 10
And it is
worthy of notice that the persons or firms, losses by reason
of advances to whom are named in argument as the main
cause of the failure and basis of recovery, were all debtors of
the bank October 3, 1881, some of them for a long time before, and all debtors January 10, 1882, and the figures of the
experts seem to show that the amounts due from them at thelatter date were not many thousand dollars greater in the ag-gregate on April 14, 1882. The indebtedness of Lee, his father
and his wife was nominally less, while that of some of those
through whom he appears to have conducted his operations
was larger. According to him such increase in poor assets, as
there was, was substantially attributable to increased-loans
made in the hope of carrying through parties already in debt
to the bank, and he says that there was really no material
change in the character of the paper between January 9 and
the stoppage of the bank.
But it is unnecessary to do more than refer tothese matters
as indicative of the uncertainty as to what losses would have
been prevented if the bank had been wound up earlier than it
was and as to the point of time to whicn the supposed -liability should be referred, if an interlocutory decree had been
entered.
We are not disposed, therefore, to reverse the decree as to
defendants Spaulding and Johnson, and although the case of
Francis E. Coit was in some aspects different, and particularly
in that he was a director for a longer period, we think it
should take the same course. He was elected a director -Vay
20, 1881, to fill a vacancy created by the death of George
Coit. He was at the time an invalid, and by reason of his

infirmity in health unable' 'to transact business, at least with
facility

His co-directors at the time of his election were

Charles T. Coit, Vought, Cushing and Lee.

He was re-elected

January 10, 1882. The evidence shows that he had for many
years been afflicted with rheumatism. -So far as appears, Lee,
Vought and Cushing were in good health, although Charles
T. Coit was not, but the latter continued in the management
of the bank down to the third of October. While it may be
said that Francis E. Coit should not have accepted the position of director, and should not have allowed himself to be
re-elected, .yet upon this question of passive negligence the
rule would be an exceedingly rigorous one which made no
allowance for the person charged under such circumstahces.
And upon the whole we do n6t feel called upon to question
the decision as to him.
It,
must be remembered that in cases turning upon questions
of fact, in order to reverse, we must be prepared to hold that
the findings were not justified. And this we cannot do, taking into consideration all the facts contained in this voluminous record, which we have attempted thoroughly to explore.
The turning point, so far as defendants Spaulding and
Johnson are concerned, (and we include with them Francis E.
Coit,) is whether under all the circumstances they were guilty
of negligence, producing any of the losses in question, not
affirmatively, but because they did not prevent them, and
this depends upon whether they should have made an examination of the books and assets of the bank, and whether, if they
had, that would have enabled them to discover such a condi-tion of-affairs as would have resulted in placing the bank nY
liquidation, and whether thereby some of the losses would
have been averted.
[Without reviewing the various decisions on the subject, we
hold that directors must -exercise ordinary care and prudence
in the administration of the affairs of a bank, and that this
includes something more than officiating as figure-heads. They
are entitled under the law to commit the banking business, as
defined, to their duly-authorized officers, but this does not absolvethem from the duty of reasonable supervision, nor ought

We accept. as sufficient, the reasons given for the exemption
of the estate of Charles T. Colt and of Cushing from liability
for the losses of the bank here in question. But we are of
opinion that, under the evidence, the defendants Elbridge G.
Spaulding, Francis E. Coit, and W H. Johnson became respectively liable for such of those losses as could have been
prevented by proper diligence upon their part as directors. It
would serve no useful purpose to refer in detail to all the evidence establishing their dereliction of duty In our opinion,
the proof is clear and convincing that a considerable part of
the amount lost to the bank, and therefore to its stockholders
and depositors, could have been saved, if they had exercised
such care in the supervision and management of the bank's
business, as men of ordinary diligence exercise in respect to
their own business. In fact, those gentlemen, while they
were directors, had no knowledge whatever of what was
being done by Lee in the conduct of the bank. They took
his word that all was right, and gave no attention whatever to the management of its business. Their eyes were as
completely closed to what he did, from day to day, in directing the affairs of the bank, as if they had deliberately determined not to see and not to know how he controlled its

business. In the cases of Francis E. Coit and Johnson, there
are some mitigating circumstances arising out of the condition
of their health, at particular dates, but they are not such as to
relieve them from the responsibility they assumed by becoming
directors. When Lee asked Johnson to become a director,
the latter expressed doubt as to whether he could give the
bank much of his time. But Lee said to him that "he could
fix that all right." Johnson having, upon one occasion, inquired, in a general way, how the bank was getting on, Lee
replied, "nicely," and Johnson was satisfied. Both Francis
E. Coit and Johnson signed reports to the comptroller of the
treasury that were false and fraudulent, without having the

slightest knowledge of their truth or falsity
andf certified to their correctness entirely upon their faith in
Lee. They acted as if confidence in him discharged them
from all responsibility touching the management of the bank.
In the case of Mr. Spaulding, there are absolutely no circumstances of a mitigating character. He was learned in thelaw, and had large experience in banking. He accepted the
position of director to accommodate Lee, and without any
examination of the condition of the bank. Lee told him the
bank was all right, and upon that, and that alone, he rested
with implicit confidence. Having taken the oath required by
the statute, that he would, so far as the duty devolved upon
him, diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the association, and having ascertained that the executive officers were
in charge of the bank, performing the duties belonging to their
respective positions, he did' not, he says, "go any further."
Under such circumstances, and as he interpreted the national
banking act, he felt' himself "relieved from any specified
He "had no knowledge of either the provisions of

the by-laws or articles of association." In his opinion, if the
directors imposed upon due executive officers of the bank
the duty of conducting its business, the duties of directors
became thereafter "nominal." He performed no duty, while
he was director, except "to examine the reports;" but he
made no examinat.on to ascertain their correctness. He says:

the bank was in the some charge that it had been."

Being

asked whether he went to the bank and made an examination
of its books, papers or affairs, he replied "I did not, I took
Mr. Lee's word for it."When asked in reference to the enor-

inons overdrafts, made while he was director, and whether 'he
did anything to prevent them, he replied "I didn't go to the
bank to ascertan. I left the officers in charge as I found
them." In response to the question whether from the 10th
day of January down to the failure of the bank he had anything to do with the affairs of the bank, aside from holding
ten shares of its stock, he said "I never examined its books
or affairs, and I only examined the reports which it made to
the comptroller, whose duty it was to see that those reports
were correct." He never requested any of his co-directors, or
any officer of the bank, to call a meeting of the board of
directors, for, said he, "that duty was devolved upon the
cashier." Lastly, and as sufficient evidence that the directors
abandoned to Lee the absolute control of all the bank's affairs
and forebore to exercise the slightest control or supervision
over him or them, only two meetings of the directors were
held from October 3d, 1881, until the bank closed its doors on
the 14th of April, 1882, over the whole of whwh period the dishonest practices of Lee extended, one, December 12th, 1881,
for the purpose only of passing resolutions relating to the
death cf Charles T. Coit, and the other, January 10th, 1882,
when Spaulding and Johnson were made directors. One of
the by-laws provided for regular meetings of the board of
directors on the first Tuesday in every month. But he had
no knowledge of such a by-law or of any such meetings. It is
plain from the evidence that if, with his long experience in
banking business, he had given one hour, or at the utmost a
few hours' time, in any week while he was director, to ascertain how this bank was being managed, he would have discovered enough that was wrong and reckless to have saved
the association, its stockholders and depositors, many, if not
all, of the losses thereafter occurring. Upon his theory of
duty, the only need for directors of a national bank is to meet,
take the required oath to administer its business diligently and

honestly, turn over all its affairs to the control of some one or
more of its officers, and never go near the bank again, unless
they are notified to come there, or until they are informed
that there is something wrong. And when it is ascertained
that these officers or some of them, while in full control, have
embezzled or recklessly squandered the assets of the baik, the
only comfort that swindled stockholders and depositors have
is the assurance, not that the directors have themselves diligently administered the affairs of the bank, or diligently
supervised the conduct of those to whom its affairs were committed by them, but -that they had confidence in the integrity
and fidelity of its officers and agents, and relied upon their
assurance that all was right. No bank can be safely administered in that way Such a system cannot be properly characterized otherwise than as a farce. It cannot be tolerated
without peril to the busirless interests of the country
We are of opinion that when the act of Congress declared
that the affairs of a national banking association shall be
4cmanaged" by its directors, and that the directors should
take an oath to "diligently and honestly administer" them,
it was not intended that they should abdicate their functions
and leave its management and the administration of its
affairs entirely to executive officers. True, the bank may act
by "duly authorized officers or agents,'' in respect to matters
of current business and detail that may be properly intrusted
to them by the directors. But, certainly, Congress never contemplated that the duty oi directors to manage and to administer the affairs of a national bank should be in abeyance
altogether during any period that particular officers anO
agents of the association are authorized or permitted by the
directors: to have full control of its affairs. If the directors of
a national bank choose to invest its officers or agents with such
control, what the latter do may bind the bank as between it
and those dealing with such officers and agents. But the
,duty remains, as between the directors and those who are
interested in the bank, to exercise proper diligence and supervision in respect to what may be done by its officers and
agents.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.

Harlan, Gray, Brewer, Brown, JJ.

As to the dree of diligence and the extent of supervision,
to be exercised oy directors, there can be no room for doubt
under the authorities. It is such diligence and supervision as
the situation and the nature of the business requires. Their
duty is to watch over and guard, the interests committed to
them. In fidelity to their oaths, and to the obligations they
assume, they must do all that reasonably prudent and careful
men ought to do for the protection of the interests of others
intrusted to their charge.
In respect to the dealings of a bank with others this court
has said "Directors cannot in justice to those who deal with
the bank, shut their eyes to what is going on around them.
It is their duty to use ordinary diligence in ascertaining the
condition of its business, and to exercise reasonable control and
supervision of its officers. They have something more to do
than, from time to time, to elect the officers of the bank, and
to make declarations of dividends. That which they ought,
by proper diligence, to have known as to the general course
of business in the bank, they may be presumed to have known,
in any contest between the corporation and those who are
justified by the circumstances in dealing with its officers upon
the basis of that course of business." Martin v. Web, 110
U. S. 7, 15. A rule no less stringent should be applied as.
between a banking association and directors representing the
interests of stockholders and depositors. Subscriptions to the
stock of a banking association, and deposits with it, are made
in reliance upon the statutory requirement, which cannot be
dispensed with, that its affairs are to be managed and administered by a board of directors, acting under oath and with such
diligence as the situation requires.
In Cuttng v. Aarlor,78 N. Y 454, 460, Chief Justice.Church,
delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said "A corporation is represented by its trustees and managers, tieir

whole duty It is misconduct not to do this, but in addition
they are required to exercise such supervision and vigilance as

bank might not be liable for a single act of fraud or crime on
the part of an officer or agent, while it would be for a continuous course of fraudulent practice, especially those so openly
committed and easily detected as these are shown to have
been. Here were no supervision, no meetings, no examination,
no inquiry"
This case was referred to, with approval, in
Preston v. Prather,137 U. S. 604, 614. So in Hwun v. Cary,
82 N. Y. 65, 71, which involved the question of the degree of
liligence to be exercised by directors of a savings bank, Judge
Earl, speaking for the whole court, said
"Few persons
would be willing to deposit money in savings banks, or to
take stock in corporations, with the understanding that the
trustees or directors were bound only to exercise slight care,
such as inattentive persons would give to their own business,
in the management of the large and important interests committed to their hands. When one deposits money in a savings
bank, or takes stock in a corporation, thus divesting himself of
the immediate control of his property, he expects, and has the
right to expect, that the trustees or directors, who are chosen
to take his place in the management and contrql of his property, will exercise ordinary, care and prudence in the trusts
committed to them -the
same degree of care and prudence
that men prompted by self interest generally exercise in their
own affairs. When one voluntarily takes the position of trustee or director of a corporation, good faith, exact justice, and
public policy unite in requiring of him such degree of care and
prudence, and it is a gross breach of duty - crassa neglegentzca

and mismanagement, is very instructive upon thins general subject. Among the objects of the corporation was the lending
of money upon pledges, etc., and banking with notes payable
on demand within the amount of its stock. One of the
breaches of duty complained of was non-attendance by committee-men or directors upon their employment. While conceding that the employment was not one affecting the government, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said "I take the
employment of a director to be of a mixed nature, it partakes
of the nature of a public office, as it arises from the charter of
Therefore committee-men are most propthe crown.,
erly agents to those who employ them in this trust, and who
empower them to direct and superintend the affairs of the
corporation. In this respect they may be guilty of acts of
commission or omission, of malfeasance or nonfeasance."
Refexring to malfeasance or nonfeasance upon the part of
,directors, he said "To instance, in non-attendance, if some
persons are guilty of -gross non-attendance and leave the management entirely to others, they may be guilty by this means
of the breaches of trust that are committed by others. By
accepting of a trust of. this sort, a person is obliged to execute
it with fidelity and reasonable diligence, and it is no excuse
to say that they had no benefit from it, but that it was merely
honora'ry, and therefore they are within the case of common
trustees.. Another objection has been made, that the court
can make no decree upon these -persons which will be just,
for it is said every man's non-attendance or omission of his
duty is his own default, and that each' particular person must
bear just such a proportion as is suitable to the loss arising
froi his particular neglect, which makes it a case out of the
power of the court. Now, if this doctrine should prevail, it is
indeed laying the axe to thiroot of the tree. But if, upon inquiry before the master, there should appear to be a supine
negligence :in all of them, by which a gross complicated loss
happens, T will never determine they are not all guilty Nor
will I ever determine that a court of equity cannot lay hold of

Syllabus.

No usage of a national bank, nor any authority to carry on its
business through executive officers and agents, will relieve its
directors from the duty imposed upon them by law of diligently managing and diligently administering its affairs, and.
actively supervising the, conduct of its officers and agents.
There was here no diligence, no supervision, but absolute
inaction in respect to the affairs of the bank.
It was said at the bar that if such a rule be rigidly applied,
a gentleman of property and means would hesitate long before
accepting the position of director in a banking association.
-This could not be the result if gentlemen of that class, becoming directors of such institutions, would exercise anything like
the care and supervision. they or any other prudent, discreet
persons give to.the management of their own business. They
ought not, by accepting and hoiding the position of directors,
to give'assurance to stockholdcEN and depositors, whose inter-estshave been committed to tfir control, tfiat the bank is being
safely and honestly managed, without doing what prudent men
of business recognize as essential to make such an assurance of
value. A banking corporation, publicly avowing that its business was to -be wholly administered, by executive officers, and
that the directors would have nothing in fact to db with its
-management, would not long retain the confidence of stockholders and depositors, a fact which, of itself, shows that the
abdication by directors of their duties and functions not only
tends to defeat the object for the creation of such an institution, Vut puts in peril the interests of stockholders and depositors.
