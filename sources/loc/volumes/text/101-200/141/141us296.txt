THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Nos. 1063,1064, 1065, 1066, 1067.

Submitted October 30, 1869. -Decided

Bray 26, 1891.

A testator gave all his estate, real and personal, to his executors for the
term of twenty years, "in trust, and for the uses, objects -and purposes
hereinafter mentioned," and authorized them to make leases not extending beyond the twenty years, and to lend money on mortgage for the
same period; and, "after the expiration of the trust estate vested in
my executors and trustees for the term of twenty years after my decease," devised and bequeathed one fourth part of all his estate, subject
to the payment of debts and legacies, to his widow, one fourth to his
daughter, one fourth to his brother, and one fourth to his nephew; gave
certain legacies and annuities to other persons; directed his executors to
pay a certain part of the income to his brother "until the final division
of my estate, which shall take place at the end of twenty years after
my decease, and not sooner;" that no part of his estate should "be
sold, mortgaged (except for building) or in any manner incumbered
until the end of twenty years from and after my decease, when it may
be divided or sold for the purposes of making a division between
my devisees as herein directed," and also that, in the event of any of
the legatees or annuitants being alive at the end of the twenty years,
there should then be a division of all his estate, "anything herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding; and in such case my executors, in making division of the said estate, shall apportion each
legacy- or annuity on the estate assigned to my devisees, who are
hereby charged with the payment of the same according .to the apportionment of my said executors;" and further provided as follows: " It
is my will that my trustees aforesaid shall pay the several gifts, legaries, annuities and charges herein to the persons named in this will, and
that no creditors or assignees or purchasers shall be entitled to any part
of the bounty or bounties intended to be given by me herein for the personal advantage of the persons named; and therefore it is my will that,

if either of the devisees or legatees named in my will shall in any way or
manner cease to be personally entitled to the legacy or devise made by
me for his or her benefit, the share intended for such devisee or legatee
shall go to his or her children, in the same manner as if such child or
children had actually inherited the same, and, in the event of such person or persons having no children, then to my daughter and her heirs."
He also declared it to be his wish that W., one of his executors, should
collect the rents and have the general supervision during the twenty
years; and further provided that the share devised to his daughter
should be conveyed at the expiration of the twenty years, for her sole
use, to three trustees to be chosen before her marriage by herself and the
trustees named in the will, and the net income be paid to her personallv
for life, and the principal be conveyed after her death to her children or
appointees; and that, in the event of his wife's marrying again, the share
-devised to her should be held by his trustees for her sole use. Held.
(1) That the powers conferred and the trusts imposed were annexed to
the office of executors; and that they took the legal title in fee,
to hold until they had divided the estate, or the proceeds of its
sale, among the devisees of the residue.
(2) That an equitable estate in fee in one fourth of the residue of the
estate vested in the brother and the nephew, respectively, from
the death of the testator.
(3) That the limitation over, in case of alienation, was intended to
apply to the residuary devises, but was void because repugnant
to the estates devised.
(4) That by the law of Illinois such an equitable estate could not be
taken, at law or in equity, for the debts of the owner.
(5) That a conveyance thereof by such owner, in consideration of an
agreement of the grantee to buy up outstanding judgments against
the grantor, and to sell the interest cofiveyed and pay one half of
the net proceeds to the grantors wife, no part of which agreement was performed by the grantee, gave him no right which a
court of equity would enforce.
(6) That these conclusions were not affected by the following facts. The
daughter was married ten years after the death of the testator,
having first, by indenture with the trustees named in the will,
appointed them to be trustees for the benefit of herself and her
children. Just before the end of twenty years from the testator's
death, a mortgagee- of all the real estate agreed with the trustees
under the will to ppstpone payment of the principal and to reduce
the rate of interest of the mortgage debt, provided the whole
estate should continue to be managed by W., and thereupon the
testator's widow, brother, nephew, daughter and her husband,
individually, and the .widow, brother and W., as trustees of the
daughter, made to W a power of attorney, reciting that by the will
the testator devised his whole estate in trust for the period of
twenty years, which was about to expire, and upon the termina-

tion of that trust to the widow, brother, nephew and daughter in
equal parts, and that it was deemed advantageous to the devisees,
as well as to the mortgagee, that the estate should continue to be
managed as a whole, and therefore authorizing W to take possession, to collect rents, to pay taxes, debts against the estate, and
expenses of repairs and management, and to sell and convey the
whole or any part of the estate at his discretion.

THESE were appeals from a,decree in equity by various persons asserting claims to the real estate devised by Ira Couch,
who died January 28, 1857, to his brother James and to his
nephew Ira, by his will dated November 12, 1855, and duly
admitted tW probate March 21, 1857, by which he appointed
his wife daroline E. Couch, his brother James Couch and his
brother-in-law William H. Wood executors and trustees, and
devised and- bequeathed all his property, real and personal, to
them in trust for the term of Gwenty years and for certain
uses and purposes, .and .then, (after payment of debts and legacies,)-in equal fourths; to his wife, to his daughter and her children, to his brother James, and' to his nephew Ira, the son of
James, with devises over in case of alienation. The material
provisions of the will are copied or stated in the margin',
1 "First. I do hereby, give, bequeath and devise unto my beloved wife
Caroline Elizabeth Couch, and my brother James Couch, and my brotherin-law William H. Wood, whom I hereby constitute, make and appoint to
be my executrix, executors and trustees of this my last will and testament,
and the survivors of them, and, .inthe event of the death of either of them,
the successor appointed by the sutrvung trustee or trustees, all my estate,
both- real and personal, of every nature, and description, for the term of
twenty years, in-trust, and for the uses and objects and purposes hereinafter mentioned and expressed, and for the.purpose of enabling-them more
fully to carry into effect the provisions of this will, and for no other use,
purpose or object; hereby giving and granting unto my said executors and
trustees full power and lawful authority to lease my real estate at such time
or times, and in such parcels, and in such way and manner and upon such
terms and conditions as to my said executors and trustees, or the survivors
or successors, of them, in their sound discretion shall be deemed most advantageous and for the true interest of my estate, but no lease shall be
granted of any building for a longer term than five years, and all leases
shall expire at the end of twenty years from the time of my death. And I
do-also hereby authorize and empo-wer my said executors and trustees, and
the survivor or survivors of them and their successors, from time to time,

Statement of the Case.

and so much of the facts as is necessary to the understanding
of the questions of law decided was as follows
as they in the exercise of a sound discretion shall deem for the true interest
of the estate, to purchase with the surplus funds belonging to my estate
such real estate as they may deem proper and expedient, and take and hold
the same as such executors and trustees as aforesaid, upon the same trusts
and for the same uses and purposes as the other real estate now owned by
me; and more especially to purchase for the benefit and use of my estate,
when they, my said executors and trustees, or the survivors and survivor
of them or successors, shall think it expedient so to do, any real estate
which is or may be.subject to any such judgment, decree or mortgage as is
or at any time hereafter may'become a lien, charge or incumbrance for my
benefit or for the benefit of my heirs or executors upon the same, and,
again, that my said executors and trustees have the like discretion to lease
the same. And I do hereby authorize my said executors and trustees, if
they shall think proper so to do, to loan on real estate situate in the city of
Chicago any of the surplus moneys, arising from my said estate as aforesaid,
on bond and mortgage; provided always that such real estate shall be worth
double the amount so loaned thereon, over and above any other liens and
incumbrances existing against the same, and that such moneys shall not be
loaned for a longer period than twenty years from my decease.
"And generally I do hereby fully authorize and empower my said executors and trustees,. from time to time, to improve my real estate, and invest
all surplus moneys belonging to my estate, arising from any source whatever, and not wanted immediately, or required to meet the payments and
advances, legacies, annuities and charges, required to be made under this
my said will, in such way and manner as to them my said executors and
trustees, or the survivor or successors of them, in the exercise of a sound
discretion shall be deemed most safe and productive; but no moneys are to
be'invested, except in improving my real estate, or in the purchase of other
real estate, or on bond and mortgage as aforesaid. And I direct that my
executors or trustees or their successors shall not purchase or improve by
building upon any real estate after the expiration of sixteen years from
my decease.
"Relying on the fidelity and prudence of my said executors and trustees
ifi executing the various trusts to them given and confided in and by this
my last will and testament, my executors are authorized to mortgage my
real estate to improve by building on the same, only in the event of the
destruction of some of my buildings by the elements, and then only to supply other buildings in the place of those destroyed.
"It is my will that all my just debts and the charges of funeral expenses
be paid and discharged by my executors, as hereinafter named and appointed, out of my estate, as soon as conveniently may be after m decease,
and the said debts become due; and I leave the charge of my funeral expenses to the discretion of my-said executors.

It was contended by some of the parties that the real estate
devised by this will was owned jointly by the testator and his

brother James. But upon the whole evidence.it clearly appeared that, although James lived with the testator and helped
give to him for the same purpose fifteen thousand dollars a year, to be paid
quarterly to him until my nephew Ira Couch attains his majority, after
which time I give to my brother James Couch one fourth part of all the net
rents, income and profits of my estate, to be paid him by my executors
quarterly until the final division of my estate, which shall take place at the
end of twenty years after my decease, and not sooner."
By the twelfth and thirteenth clauses, he gave legacies to children of

alive at the end of twenty years after my decease, it is my will and I hereby
direct that there shall be a division of all my estate, both real and personal,
at the end of said twenty years, anything herein contained to the contrary

knew, all the real estate was bought and paid for by the testator out of his own money, and the deeds were taken in his

.had no title in it, legal or equitable, except under the will.

will, appointed them to be trustees for the benefit of herself
and her children, under the twentieth clause of the will.
Three children of this marriage were born before 1877.
The testator left real estate, worth about $1,000,000, consisting of nine lots of land in the heart of the city of Chicago,
on two of which stood the Tremont House; and left personal
property to the amount of $11,000, and owed debts amounting to $112,000, besides unpaid taxes on real estate. The
trustees under the will, Wood collecting the rents and having
the principal management, improved the real estate, so as to
produce a large net income, until the great fire of October,
1871, destroyed all the buildings. In 1872 and 1873, the trustees erected new buildings on the property, at an expense of
$1,000,000, of which they borrowed $750,000, on mortgage
executed by the trustees, as well as by the widow, James, Ira,
and the daughter and her husband, individually, of all the
nine lots, payable November 1, 1877, with yearly interest at
eight per cent.
On the completion of the new Tremont House, the trustees
being unable to find any person, not interested in the estate,
who would undertake to pay a fair rent and provide the
necessary furniture, a lease thereof was made on November 15, 1873, by the widow, James Couch and William H.
Wood, as trustees under the will and as trustees of the daughter, and by the widow, James, Ira, and the daughter and her
,husband, individually, for ten years, to James Couch, who
agreed to furnish it and carry it on as a hotel, and to pay one
tenth of the gross amount of his receipts therefrom until Februarv 1, 1877, to the widow and Wood as joint trustees with
himself under the will, and after that date to pay to the
widow, to Ira and to the daughter's trustees, three fourths of
such tenth, retaining the other fourth himself. James Couch
carried on the hotel accordingly, but unsuccessfully, until
January 18, 1879, when his lease was terminated, and the
hotel was leased to another person.
In December, 1876, the mortgagee agreed with the trustees
named in the will to extend the term of payment of the principal of the mortgage debt, and to reduce the rate-of interest,

provided the whole estate should continue to be managed
as before, and Wood should remain in the principal charge
and control thereof.
On January 8, 1877, James Couch and wife, the testator's
widow, the daughter and her husband, and Ira and his wife,
in their individual names, and the widow, James Couch and
William H. Wood,,as trustees of the daughter, executed and
delivered to Wood a power of attorney, containing these recitals "Whereas by the will of Ira Couch, deceased, all of his
estate, both real and personal, was devised and bequeathed to
James Couch, Caroline E. Couch and. William H. Wood, in trust
for the peribd of twenty years from the time of his death, which
period will expire the twenty-eighth day of January, 1877, and,
upon the termination of said trust, to the said James Couch,
and Caroline E. Couch, and to Ira Couch, son of said James
Couch, and Caroline E. Johnson, daughter of said testator, and
now the wife of George B. Johnson, one fourth thereof to each
of said devisees." "And whereas the said Caroline E. Johnson did, prior to her marriage and pursuant to the provisions
of said will, by her deed of trust, appoint the said James Couch,
Caroline E. Couch and William H. Wood -trustees of all her
share and interest in said estate; and whereas, by reason of
the destruction of the buildings belonging to said estate, and
situate upon said lands, by fire, the said trustees under said
will have, as such trustees, incurred a large indebtedness in
rebuilding the same, and for other purposes beneficial to said
estate, and which indebtedness is a lien or incumbrance thereon,
and whereas it is deemed advantageous to the undersigned devisees as aforesaid, as well as to the creditors of said estate, that
the same should, from the time of the expiration of the said
period-of twenty years, be managed as a whole, by some person
appointed and agreed upon by the parties interested, to the
end that sales of said estate, or parts thereof, may be made from
time to time to meet the said indebtedness, that said estate
may in the meantime be kept rented, and the income therefrom applied to the payment of the interest on indebtedness,
the taxes, premiums on insurance, and the expenses for repairs,
and for the management of the estate." Tins power accordingly

authorized Wood, on and after January 28, 1877, to enter upon
and take possession of all the real estate devised, to rent it, and
to collect the rents, and also all arrears of rent under leases
made by the trustees under the will, to pay taxes and assessments, and the interest and principal, of debts- against the
estate, and all expenses of repairs, preservation and management thereof, and to borrow- money when necessary for these
purposes; and to sell and. convey the whole or any part of the
estate whenever and upon such terms as in his judgment
should be for the best interest of the constituents, and provided that it should be irrevocable, except that after January
28, 1880, a majority of them, or, on giving six months' notice
in writing, any one of them might "revoke this power of
attorney and annul this agreement."
By reason of the embarrassment caused by the financial
panic of 1873, the real estate depreciated -in value, so that it
was worth less than the sum due on the mortgage, and during
the years 1876, 1877 and 1878 the income was insufficient t&
pay the interest on the mortgage debt, taxes, insurance and
expenses. The estate afterwards increased in value until
1884, when the income bad become sufficient to pay annual
expenses and interest and a large part of the principal.
The testator's debts, and the legacies given by the twelfth
and thirteenth clauses of the will, as well as the annuities t&
the testator's sister and to his mother-in-law under the seventh
and eighth clauses, were all duly paid before 1877, those annuitants having died before that time. The annuities to his.
widow and daughter under the tenth clause were paid until
the fire of Odtober, 1871, but were not paid in full afterwards;
and his brother James was paid more than his share of 'the income under the eleventh clause.
The estate was never divided by the executors among the
devisees of the residue, because of the impossibility of making
partition of the most valuable lots, or of selling them, except
at a great sacrifice.
On February 15, 18'9, judgments to the amount of $6000
were recovered against James Couch, in a court of the State of
Illinois, on debts contracted since January 28, 1877, and execuvOL. cxm-20

tions thereon were forthwith taken out and returned unsatisfied. On February 24, 1879, one Sprague, who recovered two
of those judgments, amounting to $1097.85, brought a suit in
equity in that court, upon which a receiver was appointed, to
whom, by order of that court, on March 29, 1879, James
Couch executed a deed of all property, equitable interests,
things in action, and effects, belonging to him. In 1881 and
1882, James Couch's undivided fourth of the real estate devised
was levied on and sold by the sheriff on plurmes executions issued
on Sprague's judgments at law
On May 10, 1879, one Brown, as trustee for Howard Potter,
recovered judgment in the Circuit Court of the United States
against James Couch for $15,038.92 on a debt contracted in
1874, and, in 1881, caused an alias execution thereon to be
levied on the same undivided fourth, and purchased the same
at the marshal's sale on execution.
On February 9, 1881, James Conch and Elizabeth G. Couch,
his wife, executed a deed of all their interest in that fourth to
William E. Hale, expressed to be for a nominal consideration,
but the real consideration for which was a contemporaneous
agreement between the wife and Hale, by which Hale agreed
to buy up the judgments existing against James Couch, and to
sell the interests conveyed to him by the deed, and, after reimbursing himself for his exp'nses, to pay one half of the proceeds to her, and hold the other half to his own use. Hale
bought up the judgments recovered February 15. 1879, being
about one third of the judgments against Couch, as well as
the title under the sheriff's sale aforesaid, but on November
16, 1882, sold them again to Potter, and never bought up any
of Potter's claims, or paid anything to Elizabeth G. Couch.
Ira Couch, the testator's nephew, came of age January 9,
1869, and never had any children. "His interest in the estate
of the testator was conyeyed by him, being insolvent, on January 29, 1877, to one Dupee, as trustee for his creditors, with
authority to sell at private sale, by Dupee on November 26,
1881, to one Everett, in consideration of the sum of $1000 paid
by Elizabeth' G. Couch, mother of Ira, by Everett on November
28, 1881, to herj and by her, on February 28, 1886, back to Ira.

POTTER v. COUCH.
Statement of the Case.

On March 9, 1885, Caroline E. Johnson, the testator's daughter, conveyed to her husband all right, title and interest she
might or could have in real estate under the nineteenth clause
of the will. On July 5, 1885, she died, leaving her husband
and thr~e children surviving her.
On July 14, 1884, James Couch, Caroline E. Couch and William H. Wood, being the executors and trustees, and the first
two of them devisees named in the will, filed a bill in equity
in the state court to obtain a construction thereof, to which
Caroline E. Johnson and her husband and children, Elizabeth
G. Couch, Potter, Hale, Ira Couch, the judgment' Qreditors
of James Couch and the receiver appointed in Sprague's suit
in equity, were made parties.
On August 4, 1884, Potter filed in the Circuit' Court of the
United States a bill for partition of the real estate of the te2
tator, making all other parties interested defendants. On
October 23, 1884, the bill for the construction of the will, and
on May 15, 1885, the bill of Sprague, were removed into that.
court. On August 3, 1885, these three causes were consolidated by order of the court, and on November 18, 1887, after
the various parties had. filed answers stating their claims, it
was ordered that each answer might be taken and considered
as a cross bill.
No question was made as to the share devised to the wife by
the second clause, or as to the share devised to the daughter and
her children by the third and the twentieth clauses of the will.
The claims of the various parties- to the shares devised to
-the testator's brother J'ames by the fourth clause and to the
testator's nephew Ira by the.fifth clause, were as follows
Potter claimed the share of James under the judgments and
the sales on execution against him.
Hale claimed the same share under the deed to .hm from
James and. wife.
James claimed his share under the fourth clause of the will.
Ira claimed his share under the fifth clause; and also
claimed the share of Jardes, on the ground that, by reagon of
the alienations thereof tp Potter and to Hale, the devise ever-in the nineteenth clause:.to his children took effect.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Counsel for Parties.

The daughter's husband and her children respectively claimed
the shares of both James and Ira, contending that, by reason
of the alienations thereof, they vested, under the ultimate
devise over in the nineteenth clause, in the daughter and her
heirs, the husband claiming under his wife's deed to him, and
the children claiming under the twentieth clause of the will,
by reason of her death.
By the decree, it was declared that the devised estate vested
at the expiration of twenty years from the testator's death,
one fourth in fee in the widow, one fourth in fee in James,
one fourth in fee in Ira, and the remaining fourth in the
daughter for life, with remainder in fee to her children, and
the claims of Potter, of Hale, and of the daughter's husband
and children, to the shares of James and of Ira, and of Ira to
the share of James, were disallowed. Potter, Hale, the daughter's husband and her children, respectively appealed from the
disallowance of their claims, and James Couch appealed from
so much of the decree as declared that, the legal title under the
residuary devises vested at the expiration of twenty years
from the testator's death. The five appeals were submitted
together on printed briefs and arguments.

Opinion of the Court.
MEn. JUSTICE, GiA-Y, after stating the case as above, delivered
the opinion of the court.

The matters in controversy concern those shares only of Ira
Couch's real estate, which he devised to his brother James and
to his nephew Ira, the son of James.
1. In order to ascertain the nature and the time of vesting of
their interests it is important in the first place to determine
the extent and duration of the trust estate- of the executors
and trustees named in the will. bearing in mind the settled
rule that whether trustees take an estate in fee depends upon
the requirements of the trust, and not upon the insertion of
words of inheritance. Doe v Cons.zdine, 6 Wall. 458, Young
v. Bradley, 101 U. S. 782,. Zirk and v Cox, 94 Illinois, 400.
In the first clause of the will, the testator appoints his wife,
his brother James and his brother-in-law Wood "executors
and trustees" of his will, and devises and -bequeathes to them
a- his estate, real and personal, "for the term of twenty
years, in trust, and for the uses and objects and purposes
hereinafter mentioned and expressed, an for the purpose of
enabling them more fully to carry into effect the.provisions of
this will, and for no other use, purpose or object," authorizes
them to lease his real estate at their discretion, and, out of
any surplus funds, to improve his real estate, to purchase
other real estate to be held upon the same trusts, and to lend
money on bond and mortgage, but, in order that their doings
may not create any obstacle .to the division of his real estate
at the end of the twenty years, provides that they shall not
make leases, or lend money on mortgage, beyond twenty
years, or purchase, or improve by building, after sixteen years
from his death, and he also authorizes them to mortgage real.
estate for the purpose of rebuilding in case of destruction by
the elements.
In the next four clauses, he devises and bequeaths to his
widow, daughter, brother and nephew, respectively, "after the
expiration of the trust estg.te vested in my executors and trustees for the term of twenty years after my decease," one fourth
part of all his estate, both real and- personal, after payment of

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

debts and legacies, which he charges upon the real estate. In
the eleventh clause, he directs his executors to pay to his brother
a certain part of the income "until the final division of my
estate, which shall take place at the end of twenty years after
my decease, and not sooner." And in the twenty-first clause
he declares his wish that Wood shall collect the rents and
have the general care and supervision of the affairs of the
estate during the same period.
These provisions, had the testator said nothing more upon
the subject, might have been construed as assuming or implying that the trust estate was to terminate at the end of twenty
years from the testator's death, without any act or conveyance
on the part of the trustees. But the will contains other provisions concerning the powers and duties of the trustees, which
are wholly inconsistent with such a conclusion.
The sixteenth clause is as follows "I will and direct that
no part of my estate, neither the real nor the personal, shall
be sold, mortgaged (except -for building) or in any manner
incumbered, until the end of twenty years from and after my
decease, when it may be divided or sold for the purposes of
making a division between my devisees as herein directed."
The very object of this clause is to define when and for what
purposes the trustees may mortgage or may sell the real estate.
Before the end of twenty years, it is neither to b; mortgaged
(except for building, as allowed in the first clause) nor to bet
sold. At the end of the twenty years, all authority to mortgage it is to cease, but "it may be divided or sold for the purposes of making a division between my devisees as nerein
directed." This division or sale (like all sales or mortgages
spoken of in this clause) is evidently one to be made by the
trustees, under authority derived from the testator, and while
them, not a judicial division or sale
the legal title remains infor the purpose of partition, -after the legal title has passed to
the residuary devisees.
Again, in the eighteenth clatise, the testator directs that, in
the event of any of the legatees or annuitants being alive at
thQ end of twenty years after his death, there shall be a division of all his estate at that time; "anything herein contained

POTTER v. COUCH.
Opinim

of the Court.

to the contrary notwithstanding';" and that "in subh casa.py
executors, in making division of the said estate, shall apportion each legacy or annuity-on the estate assigned to my devisees, who are hereby charged with the payment of .the sameaccording to the apportionment of my said executors." Thisclause puts beyond doubt the intention of the. testator, not.
only that the division of his estate, and the assignment and
conveyance of the several shares to each devisee, shall be
made by his executors, but that the question which share
shall be charged with the payment of any legacy or annuity
shall depend upon the act of the executors in making the
division among the devisees.
Although, at the expiration of twenty years from the testator's death, all the legacies and annuities to others than the
residuary devisees had in fact been paid, yet the duty still
remained in the executors and trustees to make a division,-by
sale if necessary Under the circumstances of -this case, it was
impracticable to. make the division, either by the partition, of
the lands themselves, or by selling them and distributing the
proceeds, immediately upon the expiration of- the twenty
years, and until a division was made, in one form or the
othef, by the-.executors and trustees, the legal title -must remain in them. The. sale and conveyance by them, Whether
directly to the. residuary deviseqs, or to third persons for the.
purpose of paying the proceeds to those devisees, wa-" not "in
the exercise of a power over an estate vested in other persons,
but was for the purpose of terminating an estate vested in the
executors and trustees themselves, by conveyingit to others.
The twentieth clause, by which the daughter's share, in case
of her marriage, is to be conveyed at ther expiraton of the
twenty years by the trusteea named in the will to trustees for
the benefit of herself and her children, and the twenty-second
clause, by which the share of the widow, in case of her marrying again, is to be held by the executors and trustees in trust for
her, are also worthy of notice in this connection, although thpy
might not, standing alone, affect the time of vesting of the
legal title in the shares of the brother and the nephew. Wellford'v Snyder, 131 U. S. 521.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

There can be no doubt that all the powers conferred, and
all the trusts imposed, were annexed to the office of executors,
and not to a distinct office of trustees. And, taking the whole
will together, it is quite clear that the legal title of the executors
and trustees did not absolutely terminate upon the expiration of
twenty years from the death of the testator, because it was necessary, for the purpose of enabling them to execute the trusts
-and to carry out the provision8 of the will, that the legal title
should be and continue in them until they had, by sale or otherwise, settled the estate, and conveyed to the devisees severally
their shares in the estate or its proceeds. The testator doubtless intended that after the expiration of the twenty years the
estate:should cease to be held and managed by his executors
and trustees as a whole, and should be divided into four parts
to be held in severalty by or for his residuary devisees. But
he intended, and expressly provided, that the division should
be made by his executors and trustees, and therefore their
trust estate could not terminate until they had made the division and conveyed the shares. McArthur v Scott, 113 U. S.
340, 377, R'irkland v Cox, 94 Illinois, 400; Perry on Trusts,
§§ 305, 315, 320. Whether, in case of unreasonable delay on
their part to make the division, a court of equity might have
compelled them to do so, is a question not presented by this
record.
The decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in Eirkland
v Cox, above cited, is much in point. In that case, the testator
devised and bequeathed all his estate, real and personal, to trustees, to control and manage it, and to make such disposition of
it as should in their judgment increase its value, to pay to his
daughter such instalments as they should deem sufficient for
he, support until she reached the age of thirty-five years, and
then to convey the estate to her in fee, authorizing them, how-ever, if she should be then. married to a man whom they
thought unworthy, to continue to hold the title in trust during his life, and further providing that, if she died without
issue, the whole estate, after paying certain legacies, should
"be divided equally between" three charitable corporations.
It was held that the powers conferred on the trustees implied

POTTERI v. COUCH.
Opinion of the Court.

a power- to sell the lands and convert them into money or
interest-bearing securities; and, therefore, that the trustees took
and held the title in fee simple, notwithstanding the death of
the daughter before reaching the age of thirty-five years, the
court saying" "The power implied to sell is to sell the whole
title -and to this is essential the power to convey that title,
requiring, as a condition precedent, a fee simple estate in the
trustees. The property is devised to the trustees to sell and
convey if they deem it advisable, or to hold and control until
it is to be transferred as directed, and in the contingency that
has arisen, it was intended that it should be the duty of the
trustees to make the equal division of the property between
the corporations designated and convey it accordingly- for
the grant to these corporations is in severalty, and not as
tenants in common, and their title must necessarily rest on.
the conveyance of the trustees." 94 Illinois, 415.
The cases cited against this conclusion differ widely from
the case at bar. The two most relied on were .Minors v. Battison, 1 App. Cas. 428, in which the facts were very peculiar,
and there was much diversity of opinion among the judges
before whom it was successively brought, and .fanwe v
.anzce, 43 N. Y 303, in which the construction adopted was
the only one consistent with the validity of the will under the
statutes of New York.
2. From this view of the nature and dhration of the estate of
the 'trustees, it necessarily follows that by the terms of the
fourth and fifth clauses of the will, devising and bequeathing
to the testator's brother and nephew, respectively, "after the
'expiration of the trust estate vested in my executors and trustees," "one fourth part of all my estate, both real and personal," (after the payment of debts and legacies, which he
charged upon the real estate,) no legal title in any specific pat
of the estate, and no right of possession, vested in either of them,
until the trustees had divided the estate and conveyed to each
of them one fourth of the estate. or of the proceeds of its sale,
but, on well settled principles, an equitable estate in fee in one
fourth of the residue of the testator's whole property vested in
the brother and in the nephew respectively from the death of

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

the testator. Crojley v Cooper, 19 Wall. 167, MkcArthur v.
Scott, 113 U. S. 340, 378, 380, Phtpps v. Ackers, 9 Cl. & Fin.
583, Westonr v. Weston, 125 Mass. 268, -Vicoll v Scott, 99
Illinois, 529, Scojield v. Olcott, 120 Illinois, 362.
To the suggestion that the will violated the rule against -perpetuities, which prohibits the tying up of property beyond a
life or lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards, it is a
sufficient answer that after twenty years from the death of
the testator, and after the death of the widow and daughter,
(if not before,) the title, legal and equitable, in the whole
estate would be vested in persons capable of conveying it.
Waldo v. Cummings, 45 Illinois, 421, Lunt v Lunt, 108 Illinois, 307.
3. Nor is the estate of the residuary devisees affected by the
nineteenth clause of the will, which is in these words: "It is
my will that my trustees aforesaid shall pay the several gifts,
legacies, annuities and charges herein to the persons named in
this will, and that no creditors or assignees or purchasers shall,
be entitled to any part of the bounty or bounties intended to
be given by me herein for the personal advantage of the persons named, and therefore it is my will that, if either of the
devisees or legatees named in my will shall in any way or
manner cease to be personally entitled to the legacy or devise
*made by me for his or her benefit, the share intended for such
devisee or legatee shall go to his or her children, in the same
manner as if such child or children had actually inherited the
same, and, in the event of such person or persons having no
children, then to my daughter and her heirs."
The devise over in this clause cannot, indeed, by reason of
the'words "gifts; legacies, annuities and charges," and "bounty
or bounties," in the preamble, be confined to the legacies and
annuitieg given by the testator and charged on his real estate
by clauses six to thirteen inclusive, and by/ clause eighteen.
So to hold would be utterly td disregard the comprehensive
and decisive words, "devisees or legatees," "legacy. or devise," and "share intended for such devisee or legatee," by
which the testator clearly manifests his intention that the
devise over,shall attach to the shares of his reol estate devised

POTTER v. COUCH.
Opinion of the Court.

to his widow, daughter, brother and nephew, respectiveiy, by
clauses two, three, four and five, except so far as its effect
upon the shares of the daughter and the widow may be modified by the trusts created for their benefit by clauses twenty
and twenty-two.
The testator having declared his will that the devises of
the shares shall be "for the personal advantage of" the devieees, and that "no creditors or assignees or purchasers shall
be entitled to any part," and having directed the devise over
to take effect "if either of the devisees shall in any way or
manner cease to be. personally entitled to the devise made for
his benefit," the devise over of the shares of the brother and the nephew, if valid, would take effect upon any alienation by
the first devisee, whether voluntary .or involuntary, by sale
and conveyance, by levy of execution, by adjudication of
bankruptcy, or otherwise, or, at least, upon any such alienation
before his vested equitable estate became a legal estate after
the expiration of the twenty years.
But the right of alienation is an inherent and inseparable
quality of an estate in fee simple. In a devise of land in fee
simple, therefore, a condition against all alienation is void,
because repugnant to the estate detised. Lit. § 360, Co.
Lit. 206 b, 223 a, 4 Kent Com. 131, MeD'onogh v ._urdock,
15 How 367, 37a, 375, 412. For the same reason, a limitation over, in case the first devisee shall alien, is equally void,
whether the estate be legal or equitable. Howard v Carust,
109 U. S. 725, Ware v Cann, 10 B. & C. 433, Shaw v Ford,
7 Ch. D. 669; 14 re Dugdale, 38 Ch. D. 176, Corbett v Corbett, 13 P D. 136, Steih v Whztehead, 111 Illinois, 247, 2§1,
.Kelley v Hemzs, 13r Mass. 231, and cases there -cited. And on
principle, and according to the weight of authority, a restrictiQn,
whether by way of condition or of devise over, not forbidding
alienation to particular persons or for particular purposes only,
but against any and all alienation whatever during a limited
time, of an estate in fee, is likewise void, as repugnant to the
estate devised to the first taker, by depriving him during that
time of the inherent power of alienation. Roosevelt v Thurman, 1 Johns. Ch. 220, .3landlebaum v. 2foDonell, 29 Michigan,

Eq. (No. Car.) 61, in. re Posher, 26 Ch.D. 801.
The cases most relied on, as tending to support a different
conclusion, are two decisions of this court, not upon devises of
real estate, but upon peculiar bequests of slaves, at times and
places at which they were considered personal property Smith
v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68,
lliams v. Ash, 1 How 1.
In Smith v. Bell, the general doctrine was not denied, and
the decision turned upon the construction of the words of a
will by which a Virginia testator bequeathed all his personal
estate (consisting mostly of slaves) to his wife "to and for her
own. use and benefit and disposal absolutely; the remainder
of said estate, after her decease, to be for the use of" his son.
This was held to give the son a vested remainder, upon
grounds summed up in two passages of the opinion, delivered
by Chief Justice Marshall, as follows "The limitation in remainder shows that, in the opinion of the testator, the previous words bad given only an estate for life. This was the
sense in which he used them." 6 Pet. 76. "The limitation
to the son on the death of the wife restrains and limits the,
preceding words so'as to confine the power of absolute disposition, which they purport to confer of the slaves, to such a
disposition of them as may be made by a person having only
a life estate in them." 6 Pet. 81.
In Williams v Ash, a Maryland testatrix bequeathed to
her nephew all her negro slaves, naming them, "provided he
shall not carry them out of the State of Maryland, or sell them
to any one, in either of which events I will and devise the said
negroes to be free for life." One of the slaves was sold by
the. nephew; and, upon petition against the purchaser, was
adjudged to 13e free. As stated by Chief Justice Taney, in
delivering the opinion of the court, and recognrzed in the statute of Maryland of 1809, c, 171, therein cited, "By the laws
of Maryland, as they stood at the date of this will, and at the
time of the death of the testatrix, any person might, by deed",
or last will and testament, declare his slave to be free after
any given period of service, or at any particular age, or upon
the performance of any condition, or on the eVent of any con-

Opinion of the Court.

tingency" 1 How 13, 3 Kilty's Laws. The condition or
contingency, forbidding the slaves to be sold or carried out of
the State, was, as applied to that peculiar kind of property, a
humane and reasonable one. The decision really turned upon
the local law, and appears to have been so understood by the
Court of Appeals of the State in Steuart v Williams, 3 Maryland, 425. Chief Justice Taney, indeed, going beyond what
was needful for the ascertainment of the rights of the parties,
added "But if, instead of giving freedom to the slave, he
had been bequeathed to some third person, in the event of his
being sold or removed out of the State by the first taker, it is
evident upon common law principles that the limitation over
would have been good," citing Doe v Hawke, 2 East, 481. But
the case cited concerned an assignment of a leasehold interestonly, and turned upon the construction of its particular words,
no question of the validity of the restriction upon alienation
being suggested by counsel or considered by the court, and
the dictum of Chief Justice Taney, if applied to a conditional
limitation to take effect on any and all alienation, and attached
to.a bequest of the entire interest, legal or equitable, even 11
personalty, is clearly contrary to the authorities. Bradley v
Pezxoto, 3 Yes. Jr. 324, S. C.Tudor's Leading Cases on Prop
erty (3d ed.) 968, and note, In re Dugdale, 38 Ch. D. 176
Corbett v Corbett, 13 P D. 136, Steib v. Whdelead, 111 Ill
247, 251, Lovett v. Gillender, 35 N. Y 617.
Th 8 case at bar presents noe question of the validity of a
proviso that income bequeathed to a person for life shall not
be liable for his debts, such as was discussed in Nichols v
Levy, 5 Wall. 433, in _Nick-ol v Eaton, 91 U. S. 71,6, and 'in
Spbndle v S reve, 111 U. S. 542. In Steib v WkTeheai,
above cited, the Supreme Court of Illinois, while upholding the
validity of such a proviso, said. "We fully recognize the general proposition .that one cannot make an absolute gift or
other disposition of property, particularly an estate in fee, and
yet at the same time impose such restrictions and limitations
upon its use and enjoyment as to defeat the object of the gift
itself, for that would be, in effect, to give and not to give, in
the same breath. Nor do we at all question the general prin-

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

ciple that, upon the absolute transfer of an estate, the grantor
cannot, by any restrictions or limitations contained in the instrument of transfer, defeat or annul the legal consequences
which the law annexes to the estate thus transferred. If, for
instanoe, upon the transfer of an estate in fee, the conveyance
should provide that the estate thereby conveyed should not
be subject to dower or curtesy, or that it should not descend
to the heirs general of the grantee upon his dying intestate,
or that the grantee should have no power of disposition over
it, the provision, in either of these cases, would clearly be
inoperative and void, because the act or thing forbidden is a
right or mcident which the law annexes to every estate in fee
simple, and to give effect to such provisions would be simply
permitting individuals to abrogate- and annul the law of the
State by mere private contract. This cannot be done." 111
IUl. 251.
The restraint, sought to be imposed by the nineteenth clause,
upon any alienation by the brother or by the nephew of. the
share devised to him in fee, being void for repugnancy, it follows that upon such alienation, or upon an attempt to alienate,
his estate was not defeated, and no -title passed under the
devise over, either to the nephew in the share of the brother,
or to the daughter or her children in the share of the brother
or of the nephew, and therefore nothing passed by the
daughter's deed to her husband.
For the reasons already stated, the appeal of the nephew, Ira
Couch, from so much of the decree below, as declared the legal
title under the residuary devises to have vested at the expiration
of twenty years from the testator's death, is well taken, and the
equitable e~tate in fee in one fourtj of the residue of the testator's property, having vested in Ira Couch from the death of
the testator, passed by his deed of assignment to Dupee, and
by mesne conveyances back to him.
The various alienations of the share of the brother, James
Couch, require more consideration.
4. The appellant Potter claims the share of James Co.uch
under proceedings against him by his creditors, at law and in
equity, the effect of which depends upon the statutes of Illinois.

POTTER v. COUCH.
Opinion of the Court.

As we have already seen, the legal title in fee was vested in
the trustees, not under a passive, simple or dry trust, with no
duty except To convey to the persons ultimately entitled , but
under an active trust, requiring the continuance of the legal
title in the trustees to enable them to perform their duties;
and until the trustees had divided the property, either by conveying the lands to the residuary devisees, or by selling them
and distributing the proceeds among those devisees, James
Couch had only an equitable interest in the testator's whole
estate, and no title in any specific part of his property, real or
personal. Such being the facts, it is quite clear that the trust
was not executed, so as to vest the legal title in him, by
the statute of uses of Illinois. Hurd's Rev Stat. 1877, c. 30,
§ 3, -leacham v. Steele, 93 Illinois, 135, Eellogg v Hale, 108
Illinois, 164.
It is equally clear that such an equitable interest was not
an estate on which a judgment at law would be a lien, or an
execution at law could be levied, under the Illinois statute of
judgments and executions, although the term "real estate,"
as- used in that statute, is declared to include "lands, tenements, bereditaments and all legal and equitable rights and
interests therein and thereto." Hurd's Rev Stat. c. 77, §§ 1,
3, 10, Brandies v Cochrane, 112 U . 344, Baker v Covenbarger,. 15 Illinois, 103, Thomas v Eckard, 88 Illinois, 593,
How~rd v Peavey, 128 Illinois, 430.
By the chancery act of Illinois, "whe n ever an execution
shall have been issued against the property of a defendant, on
a judgment at law or equity, and shall have been returned
unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the party suing out such eiecution may file a bill in chancery against such defendant, and
any other person, to compel the discovery of any property, cir
thing in action, belonging to the defendant, and of any prop
erty, money, or thing in action, due to him, or held in trust
for him, and to prevent the transfer of any such property,
money or thing in action, or the payment or delivery thereof
to the defendant, except when such trust has in good faith
been created by, or the fund so held in trust has proceeded,
from, some person other than the defendant himself." HKurd's
,Rev. Stat. c. 22, § 49.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

This statute, as has been adjudged by this court, establishes
a rule of property) and not of procedure only, and applies
to all cases where the creditor, or his representative, is obliged,
by the nature of the interest sought to be reached, to resort
to a court of equity for relief, as he must do in all cases where
the legal title is in trustees, for the purpose of serving the
requirements of an active trust, and where, consequently, the
creditor has no lien, and can acquire none, at law, but obtains
one only by filing a bill in equity for that purpose. The
words "in trust," as used in the exception or proviso, cannot
have a more restricted meaning than the same words in the
enacting clause. Spindle v Shreve, 111 U S. 542, 546, 547,
WMliams v. fTkorne, 70 N. Y 270, 277, Hardenbwrgv. Bltr,
3 Stew (30 N. J Eq.) 645, 666.
As the only title of James Couch in the property devised
was an equitable interest which could not lawfully have been
taken on execution at law against him, and as the trust was
an active trust, "in good .faith created by," and "the fund
so held in trust proceeded from," the testator, "a person other
than the defendant himself," the letter and the spirit of the
statute ihke require that this equitable interest should not be
charged for his debts.
It follows that neither the judgments and executions at law,
nor the suits in equity, against James Couch, gave any lien or
title to his creditors, and that the deed from him to a receiver
was Wrongly ordered by the state court in which one of the
suits was commenced, and was rightly set aside by the Circur, Court since the removal of that suit.
5. The appellant Hale claims the share of James Couch
under a deed from him and his wife. The interest conveyed
by that deed being an equitable interest only, Hale requires
the aid*of a court of equity to perfect his title, and would have
to seek it by cross bill, but for the order of the Circuit Court
that each answer should be taken as a cross bill. The real
consideration of that conveyance was an agreement by which
Hale promisedto buy up the existing judgments against James
Couch, to sell the interest conveyed by the deed of James and
wife, and to pay to the wife one half of the net proceeds. In

POTTER v. COUCH.
Opinion of the Court.

fact, he bought up some of the judgments only, and sold those
again, and never performed his agreement in this or any other
particular. Consequently, he is not entitled to the affirmative
interposition of a court of equity to obtain the interest included
in the deed. Towle v. Ambs, 123 Illinois, 410.
6. It remains only to consider the contention that by the
instrument of January 8, 1877, the devisees entered into an
agreement by which they took the whole estate as tenants in
common, and rendered any division unnecessary, and therefore
all the duties of the trustees ended, and the legal title vested
in the residuary devisees, at the expiration of the twenty
years. Undoubtedly, those interested in property held in
trust, and ultimately entitled to the entire proceeds, may elect
to take the property in its then condition, and to hold it as
tenants in common, but the acts showing an intention so to
take must be unequivocal, and must be concurred in by all the
parties interested. Young v Bradley, 101 U. S. 782, Baker
v Cyenbarger, 15 Illinois, 103, Ridgeway v. Underwood,
67 Illinois, 419, 1 Jarman on Wills (4th ed.) 598-602. In
the present case, the instrument in question cannot have this
effect, for two reasons In the first place, it manifested no
intention to alter in any way the existing titles of the residuary
devisees, either as being legal or equitable, or as being in severalty or in common, but was simply a power of attorney, the
object of which was to continue Wood's management of the
estate as a whole, as under the twenty-first clause of the will.
In the next place, the instrument was not executed by or in
behalf of all the parties in interest, inasmuch as it was not
executed by. any one authorized to affect the share devised for
the daughter's benefit for life, and to her children or appointees
after her death. By the clear terms of the twentieth clause of
the will, neither the daughter nor her husband had any
authority to do this, and her trustees had no .power over her
share until it had been conveyed or set apart to them by the
trustees under the will, and if the trustees under the will were
duly constituted trustees for her and for her children (which
is disputed) they had no greater power m this respect, before
the estate was divided, than distinct trustees would have had.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The result is, that the decree of the Circuit Court must be
affirmed in all respects, except that the declaration therein as
to the time when the legal estate of the residuary devisees
vested must be modified in accordance with the opinion of this
court.
This conclusipn, by which the brother and the nephew take
,the shares origilally d&:ised to them, carries out the intention
f the testator, though probably not by the same steps that he
contemplated.
Decree accQrdijigly the appellants z eack apea, except
,ames Couch, to pay onefourth of the costs, tnluding the
cost of _prntndg the record.
