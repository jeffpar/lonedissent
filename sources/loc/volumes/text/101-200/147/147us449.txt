RORNER v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIFCATE FROM THE

CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 1247. Argued January 17, 1893. -Decided January 30, 1893.
Certain bonds Issued by the Government of Austria, held to represent a
1,lottery or similar scheme," within the meaning of § 3894 of the Revised
Statutes, as enacted by the act of September 19, 1890, c. 908, (26 Stat.
465) ; and a given circular held to be a "circular concerning any lottery, socalled gift, concert or other similar enterprise offering prizes dependent
upon lot or chance," within the meaning of said § 3894; and the said
circular held to constitute a "list of the drawings at any lottery or similar scheme," within the meaning of said § 3894.
What is a lottery, considered.
Cases in the United States and England, considered.
Although, by the bonds in question, Austria attempted to obtain a loan of
money, she also undertook to assist her credit by an appeal to the cupidity of those who bad money, and offered to each holder of a bond a chance
of obtaining a prize dependent upon lot or chance, the elerment of certainty
going hand in hand with the element of lot or chance, but the former
not destroying the existence or effect of the latter.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

by the act of September 19, 1890, c. 908, 26 Stat. 465. The
section, as so amended, reads as follows: "No letter, postal

Section 3894, as originally enacted in 1874, was an embodiment of § 149 of the act of June 8, 1872, c. 335, 17 Stat. 302,
and read as follows: "Se e . 3894. No letter or circular concerning illegal lotteries, so-called gift concerts, or other similar

mail. Any person who shall knowingly deposit or send anything to be conveyed by mail in violation of this section shall
be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars
nor less than one hundred dollars, with costs of prosecution."
By the act of July 12, 1876, c. 186, § 2, 19 Stat. 90, § 389-1 was
amended by striking out the word "illegal."
The present indictment contains two counts. The first count
alleges that Edward H. Horner, on December 29, 1891, did
unlawfully and knowingly cause to be deposited in the post
office at the city of New York, in the Southern District of
New York, a certain circular to be conveyed and delivered by
mail, "which said circular in the contents thereof, hereinafter
set forth, concerned a lottery, and which was then and there
addressed to Joseph Ehrman, 70 Dearborn Street, Chicago,

Opinion of the Court.

The defendant pleaded not guilty, was tried, convicted of
the charges contained in the indictment, and sentenced, on
for each year, and that thereafter to and including the fifty-fifth year after
the date of issue of such so-called bonds two drawings per year were to
take place for the same purpose, at the end of which time all of said
so-called bonds were according to the plan aforesaid to be repaid; and
according to said plan the smallest amount to be paid for any of such
so-called bonds selected for payment during the first year after issue was
one hundred and thirty-five gulden, during the second year one hundred
and forty gulden, and during the third year one hundred and forty-five
gulden, and so on, increasing in amount five gulden each year until the
amount should reach two hundred gulden, which amount then remained
fixed as the minimumii sum to be paid for any of the so-called bonds, the

said plan other large amounts being provided to be paid on certain of the

OCTOBER TER4, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

May 24 , 1892, to pay a fine of $100.. A bill of exceptions
was made, which states that it was admitted on the record, by
the counsel for both parties, that the bond in question in the
case represented 100 florins, and was one of a series of bonds
aggregating 40,000,000 gulden, state loan, and that the bonds,
of which the one offered in evidence was one, all represented
loans made to the Empire of Austria, and were issued for the
purpose of raising revenue for the government, in order to
defray governmental expenses. and carry on general state

affairs.
After the prosecution had rested, the counsel for the defendant moved the court to direct the jury to acquit, on the following grounds: (1) The defendant is not shown by the evidence
to have committed any offence against any statute law of the
United States or against the common law; (2) The circular,
with causing the mailing whereof the defendant is charged in
this prosecution, is not a matter prohibited under section 3894
of the Revised Statutes; (3) Said circular does not concern or
relate to a lottery, so-called gift concert or similar enterprise
offering prizes depending upon lot or chance, or concerning
schemes devised for obtaining money or property under false
pretences, nor does the same concern or relate to a lottery or
similar. scheme or a lottery ticket or part thereof; (4) That
the bond or bonds mentioned in said circular which have been
proved herein are not a lottery, so-called gift concert, or similar enterprise offering prizes depending upon lot or chance, or
concerning schemes devised for the purpose of obtaining money
or property under false pretences, nor are the same a lottery or
similar scheme or lotteiy ticket or part thdreof; (5) That the
boInd or bonds mentioned in the indictment, and proved upon
the trial herein, are government bonds issued by the Empire of
Austria, and not within the language, meaning or purview of
the statute for any violation of which the said Edward H=.
Horner, the defendant, has been charged herein. The counsel
for the defendant also moved that the prosecution be dismissed
on the same grounds severally as above enumerated. The court
denied each of those motions, and the counsel for the defendant took, and was duly allowed, exceptions to such denials.

HORNER v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

On the 14th of July, 1892, a writ of error from the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second' Circuit, to
review the judgment of the Circuit Court, was allowed and
sued out. In the Circuit Court of Appeals it was assigned for
error: (1) That the matters charged in the indictment and
proved upon the trial do noi constitute a crime by the common
law or under any statute of the United States; (2) That the
circular with mailing or causing the mailing whereof the
defendant is charged herein does not concern or relate to a
lottery, so-called gift concert or similar enterprise offering
prizes depending upon lot or chance, or concerning schemes
devised for the purpose of obtaining money or property under
false pretences, nor does the same relate to a lottery or similar
scheme, or a lottery ticket or part thereof; (3) That the bond
or bonds mentioned in said circular and proved upon the trial
are government bonds issued by the Empire of Austria, and
not within the language, meaning or purview of the statute,
with a violation of which the said Edward H. Homer has been
charged herein; (4) That the court erred in not directing the
jury to acquit the defendant upon the trial hereof; (5) That
said court erred in not dismissing the prosecution herein.
The, Circuit Court of Appeals, on the 31st of October, 1892,
pursuant to § 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat.
828, certified to this court the following questions or propositions of law, concerning which it desired the instructions of this
court for its proper decision: "(1) Do the bonds mentioned
and described in the first and second counts of the indictment
herein represent a Ilqttery or similar scheme' within the meaning of section thiity-eight hundred and ninety-four of the
Revised Statutes of thie United States? (2) Is the circular
described and set forth in the first and second counts of the
indictment herein a ' circular concerning any lottery, so-called
gift concert or other similar enterprise offering prizes dependent upon lot or chance' within the meaning of section thirtyeight hundred and ninety-four of the Revised Statutes of the
United States? (3) Does the circular mentioned and set forth
in the first and second counts of the indictment herein constitute a ' list of the drawings at any lottery or similar scheme '

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

within the meaning of section thirty-eight hundred and ninetyfour of the Revised Statutes of the United States?"
It is contended on behalf of Horner that it is not a proper
test to apply to the government bonds in question, whether or
not they have an element of chance in them.; that the test
ought to be, whether they are a "lottery or similar scheme ;"
that they are not a "lottery or similar scheme;" and that -all
.thequestions certified should be answered in the negative.
It is urged that all the bonds are to be redeemed within
fifty-five years from the date of their issue; that during the
first year the Austrian governmeht agrees to pay, as the miniMum amoupt for any bond redeemed, 135 gulden; during the
second year, 140 gulden; I during the third year, 145 gulden;
and so on, increasing 5 gulden in amount each year, until the
minimum amount to be paid by the government on each bond
redeemed is 200 gulden; that the primal object is only to
raise money to carry on the government; that the money
received by the government upon the bonds is not used as a
fund out of which to pay prizes or to repay the loan; that the
money for such purposes is raised by taxation and the
usual means of raising revenue; that the bonds were issued in
1864, many years prior to the enactment of the original statute of the United States, which was passed in 1872; and that,
as the government loan in question has for its primary object
a loan, it is not transformed into a lottery because it has
attached, as a subsidiary feature, an element which is like
that of a lottery, in the distribution by lot .or chance of certain larger premiums or awards.
But we are of opinion that the scheme in question falls
within the inhibition of § 3894, as amended. The denunciation of that section is no longer against sending by mail a circular concerning an "ille g al2 '- lottery, but is against mailing a
"circular concerning any lottery, so-called gift-concert, or
other similar enterprise offering prizes dependent upon lot or
chance."
Each "premium bond" states that the 100 florins-is a
"share of the loan of forty million florins," for which will be
paid to the bearer "the amount resulting according to the

HORNER v . UNITED STATES.
Opiniod of the Court.

plan of redemption." This plan of redemption is set forth on
the back of each bond, and by it each bond belongs, to a distinct series, the number of which is on the face of, the bond,

together with the number of the bond in that series.

Thus,

the bond set out in the first count, is No. 60 of Series 921.
The bonds do not purport to be payable on a certain day, but,
in order to determine what bonds are to be paid, and at what
time, and what amount is to be paid on each of them respectively, it is stated on the back of the bonds, (which, are dated
February 11, 1864,) that until April, 1874, there are to be five
drawings a year, on certain dates, to*determine on which of
the bonds payments are to be made and the amounts of such
payments; that thereafter, and until the end of the nineteenth
year from the date of the issue of the bonds, four drawings a
year are to take place at stated dates, for the same purpose; that
thereafter, to and including the thirty-first year, three drawings a Year are to take place at certaih dates, and that thereafter, to and including the fifty-fifth year after the date of the
issue, two drawings a year are to take place for the same purpose, at the end of which time all of the bonds are to be paid.
According to such plan, the smallest amount to be paid for
any bond selected for payment during the first year after
issue is 135 gulden ; during the second year, 140 guldei ; during the third year, 145 gulden; and so in,increasing in amount
five gulden each year, until the amount reaches 200 gulden,
which amount then remains fixed as the minimum sum to be
paid for any bond the payment of which shall be determined
by such drawings.
Under the plan, other and larger amounts are proVided to
be paid on certain of the bonds, to be determined by the
drawings, namely, during the first year, on one bond, 250,000
gulden; on one, 25,000 gulden; on one, 15,000 gulden; on one,
10,000 gulden; on each of two bonds, 5000 gulden; on each
of three, 2000 gulden; on each of six, 1000 gulden; on each
of fifteen, 500 gulden; and on each of thirty,'400 gulden.
The first count further alleges that during subsequent
periods other provision is made for such larger amounts; that
all of the bonds are in the same form, have the same drawing

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

and redemption plan endorsed upon them, and are identical in
all respects, except that the series number and the number
thereof vary as to each bond; and that all of the drawings,
by which are determined, first, the series of the bonds to be
paid or redeemed in each year, and second, the particular
bonds in the series whose holders shall be entitled to the
larger sums, "the numbers of which are drawn from the
wheel," are conducted in such a way that the determination
of the numbers, both for redemption and for the larger
amounts, "is wholly by lot or chance," the holder of each
bond having an equal chance with the holder of every other
bond, in securing, first, an early payment of his bond, and
second, as a payment for his bond the very large prizes to
which reference is above made, the result in each case "being
dependent wholly on lot or chance." The circular set forth
in the indictment contains a list of the drawings of the
scheme.
In the Century Dictionary, under the word "lottery," is the
following definition: "-A scheme for raising money by selling
chances to share in a distribution of prizes; more specifically,
a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance among persons purchasing .tickets, the correspondingly numbered slips
or lots, representing prizes or blanks, being drawn from a
wheel on a day previously announced in connection with the
scheme of intended prizes. In law the term lottery embraces
all schemes for the distribution of prizes by chance, such as
policy-playing, gift-exhibitions, prize-concerts, raffles at fairs,
etc., and includes various forms of gambling. M ost of the
governments of the continent of Europe have at different
periods raised money for public purposes by means of lotteries;
and a small sum was raised in America during the Revolution
by a lottery authorized by-the Continental Congress. Both
State and private lotteries, have been forbidden by law in
Great Brithin and in nearly all of the United States, Louisiana
and Kentucky being the two notable exceptions." Under that
definition, the circular in question had reference to a lottery.
In Webster's Dictionary, "lottery" is defined as "A distribution of prizes by lot or chance."

RORNER v. UNITED STATES.

459

Opinion" of the Court.

In Worcester's Dictionary, it is defined as "A distribution
of prizes and blanks by chance; a game of hazard, in ivhich
small sums are ventured for the chance of obtaining a larger
value, either in money or in other articles; " and it is there
said that during the eighteenth century the English govern-.
ment constantly availed itself of this means to raise money
for various public works.
In the Imperial Dictionary, the word is defined thus: "Allotment or distribution of anything by fate or chance; a procedure or scheme for the distribution of prizes by lot; the
drawing of lots. In geneial, lotteries consist of a certain
number of'tickets drawn at the same time, some of which.
entitle the holders to prizes, while the rest are blanks. This
species of gaming has been resorted to at different periods by
most of the European governments, as a means of raising
money for public purposes."
Although the transaction in question was an attempt by
Austria to obtain a loan of money to be put into her treasury,
it is quite evident that she undertook to assist her credit by
an appeal to the cupidity of those who had money. So she
offered to every holder of a 100-florin bond, if it was redeemed
during 'the first year, 135 florins, if during the second year,
140 florins, and so on, with an increase of 5 florins each year,
until the sum should reach 200 florins; *andshe also offered to
the holder, as part of the bond, a chance of drawing a prize
varying in amount from 400 florins to 250,000 florins. Every
holder of a bond has an equal chance with the holder of every
other bond of drawing one of such prizes. Whoever purchases
one of the bonds, purchases a chance in a lottery, or, within
the language of the statute, an "enterprise offering -prizes
dependent upon lot or chance." The element of certainty
goes hand in hand with the element of lot or chance, and the
former does not destroy the existence or effect of the latter.
What is called in the'statute a "so-called gift concert" has in
it an element of certainty and also an element of chance; and
the transaction embodied in the bond in question. is a "similar
enterprise" to lotteries and gift concerts. ' "
In United States v. Zeisler, 30 Fed. Rep. 499, the Circuit

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

Court of the United States for the Northern District of
Illinois, held by Judge Blodgett, referring to certain bonds
issued by the city of Vienna, in Austria, under a scheme in
substance like that embodied in the bonds now before us,
decided that circulars concerning the drawings thereunder
were within the inhibition of § 3894. Judge Blodgett, in his
opinion in the case, said pp. 500, 501: "If these drawings
determined only the time when these bonds would be paid, I
should say that the mere determining of that time by lot or
drawing would not give them the characteristics of a lottery;
but when a city or a government, in order to make an inducement for people to buy their bonds, holds out large prizes to
be drawn by chance, or determined by lot in the manner in
which prizes are usually determined in even an honestly conducted lottery, it seems to me. it comes clearly and distinctly
within the inhibiting clause of the statute under which this
indictment is found. The mere reading of one of these bonds,
and the drawing plan annexed to it, which is put in evidence,
shows that it was the intention to, stimulate the sale of the
bonds 'bythese large prizes, which were to be determined at
every drawing, and which every holder of a bond had the
chance of obtaining; and hence it seems to me that the purpose of the scheme was not only'to determine by lot when the
bonds should be paid, but also to determine certain extraordinary chances to the holders of the fortunate numbers drawn.
The mere fact that these bonds are authorized by the law of
a foreign country, and sanctioned by the policy of such
country, does not, as it seems to me, in the least degree affect
the question in this case. In Governors of the Almshouse &c.
v. American Art Union, 7 N. Y. 228, a lottery was defined
to be ' a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance;' and
the same definition is given in Thomas v..People, 59 Illinois,
160, and .Dun v. _Peo/ple, 40 Illinois, 465. The bonds in question certainly involved a lottery, within the meaning of the
cases I have cited, and many, more to the same effect- might
also be quoted. The circular sent through the mail was
intended to induce persons to purchase and deal in these
bonds with the hope of becoming the lucky winners of some

HORNR v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion: of the Court.

of the high prizes to be distributed at each drawing; and the
fact that the purchasers of the bonds were, by the drawing

equivalent to a very small rate of interest upon that principal,
do,.not, as it seems to me, change the character of the transactioh, or relieve -it from' the characteristic features of a lottery; that is, that high prizes, out of all due proportion to the
amount of money paid for a bond, were to be drawn for, and
distributed by chance among the holders of these bonds, in
the same manner as the prizes-are determined in an ordinary
lottery."
In Baloo v. State, 73 Maryland, 1, the Court of Appeals
of Maryland held that the selling of the Austrian. bond r in
question was a violation of the anti-lottery law of that State.
The Maryland Code, article 27, § 172, provided against the
drawing of any lottery, or the selling of any lottery ticket, in
the State; § 173 priovided that all devices and contrivances
designed to evade the provisions of § 1712 should be deemed
offences against it; § 174 provided a punishment for offendingagainst any of the provisions of § 172 and § 173; § 183 provided that the preceding sections should apply to all lotteries,
whether authorized by ,any other State, District orTerritory, or
by any foreign country, and that the prohibition of sale of any.
lottery ticket or other device in the, nature thereof, should
apply to lotteries drawn out of Maryland as well as those
drawn within it; and § 184 provided that the courts should"
construe the foregoing provisions, relating to lotteries, liberally,and should adjudge all tickets, parts of tickets,. certificates or
any other device whatsoever, by which money or any other
thing was to be paid or delivered on the happening of any
event or contingency, in the nature of a lottery, to be ,lottery
tickets. Ballock was indicted and convicted for violating
those provisions, by selling Austrian 'government bonds substantially'like the bonds in question here. The Court of
Appeals said, (p. 8:) "It is: true that Austrian government
bonds are vendible and ought to be treated as other articles
of commerce, as a rule; but when those bonds are coupled
with conditions and stipulations. which change their character

Opinion of the Court.

from simple government bonds for the payment of a certain
sum of money to a species of lottery ticket which falls under
the condemnation of our statutes, it must be classed as its conditions characterize it, and then it is not vendible under our
law, and it does not violate constitutional provision or treaty
stipulation to so hold." The court further remarlked that it
had been vigorously argued, that because the money ventured
must all come back, with interest, so that there could be no
final loss, it could not be a lottery, and added: "At some
uncertain period determined by the revolution of a wheel of
fortune, the purchaser of a bond does get his money repaid;
but we do riot think this deprives the thing of its evil tendency,
or robs it of its lottery semblance and features. The inducement for investing in such bonds is offered of getting some
'bonus,' large and small, in the future, soon or late, according
to the chances of the wheel's disclosures. The investment may
run one year or it may run thirty years, according to the decision of the wheel. It cannot be said this is not a species of
gambling, and that it does not tend in any degree to promote
a gambling spirit and a love of making gain through the chance
of dice, cards, wheel or other method of settling a contingency.
It certainly cannot be said that it is not in ' the nature of a
lottery,' and that it has no tendency to create desire for other
and more pernicious modes of gaming. Our statute does not
justify a court, expressly directed to so construe the law as to
prevent every possible evasion, whether designedly or accidentally- adopted, in aeciding a thing is not a lottery, simply
because there can be no loss, when there may be very large
contingent gains, or because it lacks s6me element of a lottery
according to some particular dictionary's definition of one,
when it has all the other elements, with all the pernicious
tendencies, which the State is seeking to prevent."
In .ong v. State, 74 Maryland, 565, 572, it was said to be a
valid exercise of power in a State to protect the morals and
advance the welfare of the people by prohibiting every scheme
and device bearing any semblance to lottery or gambling.
In Cohens v. 'irginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 441, it was held that

city of Washington to authorize the drawing of lotteries for
certain purposes it could not force the sale of the tickets in
Virginia, where such sale was prohibited by law. That case
is a strong authority in favor of the view that, although lottery
tickets are authorized by one government, such validity cannot
authorize their sale within the territory of another government
which forbids such sale. That is the case now before us.
As to what have been held to be lottery tickets by the
courts of the several States, reference may be made to Commonwealth v. Chubb, in the General Court of Virginia, 5 Randolph, '15; Dunn v. The People, 40 Illinois, 465, where it
was held that the character of the transaction would notbe
changed by assuming that the ticket represented an article of
merchandise *intrinsically worth the amount which the holder
would be obliged to pay, and that if every ticket in any ordinary
lottery represented a prize of same value, yet if those prizes
were of unequal values, the scheme of distribution would still
remain a lottery; Thomas v. The People, 59 Illinois, 160,
where a ticket was a receipt for money in payment for the
delivery of a copy of an engraving, and for admission to certain concerts and lectures, for which it was sold, and money
was to be distributed in presents amounting to a certain numher, to the purchasers of engravings, and it was held that that
was a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance, and constituted a lottery, it being apparent that some of the purchasers
would fail to receive a prize, and that even if. the ticket to the
concerts and lectures, and the engraving, were..intrinsically
worth the price paid, the scheme would still be a lottery;
Chavannah v. The State, 49 Alabama, 396, where it was held
that the venturing of a small sum of money for the chance of
obtaining a greater sum was a lottery; Commonwealth v. The
Sheriff, 10 Phila. Rep. 203, where it was said that whatever
amounted to the distribution of prizes'by chance was a lottery,
no matter how ingeniously the object of it might be concealed; Iloloman v. The State, 2 Tex. App. 610, where it was
held that selling boxes of candy at fifty cents each, each lox
being represented to contain a prize of money or jewelry, the
purchaser selecting his box in ignorance of its contents, was -a

device in the nature of a lottery; State v. Lumsden, 89 Nor.
Car. 572, wherea like device was held to be a lottery; and
Commonwealta v. Wright, 137 Mass. 250.
Oases in England are to the same effect. In Reg. v. Harris,
10 Cox's C.0. 352, it was held that a lottery in which tickets
were drawn by subscribers of a shilling, which entitled them
at all events to what purported to be of -the value of a shilling, and also to the chance of a greater value than a shilling,
was an illegal lottery within the statute. In Sykes v. Beadon,
11 Ch.D. 170, 190, there were holders of certificates, who subscribed money to be invested in funds which were to be divided
amongst them by lot, and divided unequally, that is, those who
got the benefit of the drawings got a bond bearing interest
.and a bonus, which gave them different advantages from the
persons whose certificates were not drawn; and it depended
upon chance, who got the greater or the lesser advantage.
The scheme was held to be a subscription by a number of persons to a fund fot the purpose of dividing that fund among
them by chance, and unequally; and Sir George Jessel, Master
of the Rolls, characterized the scheme as a lottery. In Taylor
v. Smetten, 11 Q. B. D. 207, packets were sold, each containing
a pound of tea, at so much a packet. In each packet was a
coupon entitling the purchase'r to a prize, and that fact was
stated publicly by the seller before the sale, but the purchasers
did not know until after the sale what prizes they were entitled
to, and the prizes varied in character and value. The tea was
good and worth the money paid for it. It was held that the
transaction constituted a lottery, within the meaning of the
statute.
. The only case of importance to the contrary is that of 1oh
v. Koeder, 96 N. Y..362. That was an action brought in the
Supreme Court of New York by Kohn against Koehler, under
§ 32 of part 1, c. 20, title 8, article 4, of ihe Revised Statutes
of New York, which provided that "any person who shall
purchase any share, interest, ticket, certificate of any share or
interest, or part of a ticket, or any paper or instrument purporting to be-a ticket- or share or interest in any ticket, or purporting to be a certificate of any share or interest in any

ticket, or in any portion of any illegal lottery, may sue for
and recover double the sum of money and double the value of
any goods or things in action which he may have paid or
delivered in consideration of such purchase, with double costs
of suit." Kohn sued to recover double the amount paid by
him to Koehler. for a bond issued by the authority of the
government of Austria, like the bonds now in question before
us, and which the Court of Appeals stated "purported on its
face to be a share or interest in and to a certain illegal lottery."
The constitution of New York of 1846, in article 1, § 10,
provided as follows: "Nor shall any lottery hereafter be
authorized, or any sale of lottery tickets allowed, within this
State." :By § 22 of part 1, c. 20, title 8, article 4, of the
Revised Statutes of New York, a penalty was provided
against a person who should set up or propose any money to
be distributed by lot or chance, to any person who should
have paid or contracted to pay any valuable consideration for
the chance of obtaining such money; by § 24, all contracts
made or executed for the payment of any money in consideration of a chance in a distribution of money should be void;
and by § 26, "every lottery, game or device of chance, in the
nature of a lottery, by whatever name it may be called, other
than such as have been authorized by law, shall be deemed
unlawful, and a common and public nuisance."
At the special term of the Supreme Court, the defendant
had a judgment in his favor, which was reversed by an order
of the general term. 21 Hun, 466. The Court of Appeals
reversed the order of the general term an&affirmed the judgment of the special term. In its opinion the Court of Appeals
said that the pturpose of the Austrian government, in issuing
the bonds, was to obtain money for its own use; that the
provision by which, upon a certain contingency, the holder of
the bond might receive an additional sum, was no doubt an
liducement held out for the purpose of obtaining money on
the sane, but it did not constitute the main feature and the
substance of the transaction between the government and the
purchaser of the bond; and that it could not be held, upon
any sound theory, that the privilege of obtaining by lot or

chance a larger sum than the principal, interest and premium,
which the holder was sure to get in any event, imparted to
the loan the character, object and accompaniments of a mere
lottery scheme, in violation of the constitution and laws of
the State of New York. Judge Finch dissented.
It is to be noted that the New York statute under which
the action referred to was brought, was aimed against a share
or interest in an "illegal" lottery. The act of Congress of
'June 8, 1872; now § 3894 of the R evised Statutes, as originally
enacted, condemning only "illegal" lotteries, was amended'by
the act of September 19, 1890, so as to cover "any ldttery, socalled gift concert, or other similar enterprise offering prizes
dependent upon lot or chance." As the New York statue
contained the word "illegal, " it may be that the Court of
Appeals gave force to the view that the Austrian loan was a
legal lottery, from the fact that-it dwelt so largely on the idea
that the bonds were issued by the Austrian government, in
accordance with its laws, for the purpose of obtaining a loan
of money, in connection with' the further facts stated by it;
that like bonds had been issued by several governmenits of
other countries, and that the bond in question was an evidence
of debt and a public security of a foreign government, exposed
for sale in the same manner as other securities upon which
inoney is loaned. -It by no means follows that the Court of
Appeals would have made a like decision on a statute with
language in it like that of § 3894.
The case of .EcparteShorbet, 70 California, 632, merely followed the ruling in .oan v: .Afoehler, supra. .
The question whether the transaction covered by this indictment was ah offence against § 3894, was sought to -be raised
in the case of Horner v. United States, No. 2, (113 U. S. 570,)
which was before us prior to the finding of this indictment, on
an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court dismissing a writ
of habeas corpus sued out on the commitment of Horner by a
commissioner of the court, to await the action of the grand jury.
The point was raised here, on the appeal, that the Austrian
bond scheme was not a lottery; but this court said (p: 577)
that that question was properly triable by the Circuit Court, if
