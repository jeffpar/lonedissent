it had-power to reopen the matter. It did so and its action in
that respect is not open to question here. However stringent
may be the practice m refusing to reconsider what has been
done, it still is but practice, not want of jurisdiction, that makes
the rule.
The plaintiff in error does not argue the merits of the order
of the Circuit Court. Assuming that they, as well as the jurisdiction of the court to make the order, are open here, we see
no sufficient reason for disturbing the decision. The'Circuit
Court was warranted by the affidavits .before it in finding that
the defendant was doing no business and- had- no property in
the State of New York, and that the service on a director
casually within the State for a few days was bad. Conley v

APPEALS FROM THE CIRCIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE EASTERN -DISTRICT O1 KENTUCKY.

FbR

Nos. 113,114. Argued January 5, 190.-Decided April 17, 103.
A Federal court is not required to give a judgment in a state court any
greater weight than is awarded to it in the courts of the State in which
it was rendered. As it is the settled rule in Kentucky that an.adjudication in a suit for taxes is not an estoppel between the parties as to taxes
of any other year, even though such adjudication involves the finding
of an exemption by contract, not only as to taxcs involved in ihe suit

but also as to all taxes that might be levied under the contract, the

COVINGTON v. FIRST NAT. BANK.
198 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Federal courts will not enjoin the collection of taxes for subsequent
years on the ground that their invalidity was adjudicated by such a
judgment.
The statute of Kentucky of March 21, 1900, taxing shares of national
banks, from the years 1893 to 1900 and thereafter held, void and in
conflict with ยง 5219, Rev. Stat., as to those portions which are retr'active
as imposing a burden on the ban: not borne by other moneyed corporations of the State, and valid and not in conflict with ยง 5219 as to taxes
imposed thereafter.
A difference in methods in assessing shares of national banks from that of
taxing state banks does not necessarily amount to a discrimination,
rendering the act invalid under ยง 5219, and justify the judicial interference of courts for the protection of the shareholders, unless it appears
that the difference in method actually results in imposing a greater
burden on the national banks than is imposed on other moneyed capital
in the State.

Tins case was here upon a former appeal, which was dismissed for want of final decree in the court below Covinglon
v Coinngton FirstNatwnal Bank, 185 U S. 270.
The original action was brought to enjoin the assessment or
collection of taxes on certain shares of capital stock of the
First National Bank of Covington for the years from 1893
to 1900, inclusive, and to enjoin the arrest of the president
and cashier of the bank for not listing such shares, and for a
decree adjudicating the same not liable to taxation up to the
tithe of the expiration of the charter of the bank on November 17, 1904.
The principal grounds alleged and relied upon are that by
reason of the acceptance of the terms of the act of the general
assembly of Kentucky, passed in 1886, known as the Hewitt
law, an irrevocable" contract had been made between the bank
and the State, whereby the former was to pay to the State
taxes at a certain rate on its stock, surplus and undivided
profits, which, when paid, were to be in full of all other State,
county or municipal taxes, except those levied on the bank's
real estate. It was averred that complainant had' regularly
paid such taxes up to and including those due July 1, 1900.
That the fact that the bank had such irrevocable contract had
been adjudicated and finally determined by a decision in the

CO'iNGTON v FIRST NAT. BANK.
108 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

1900, which undertakes to impose taxes for the years 1893 and
following, is unconstitutional and void, and operates to discriminate against the complainant, in violation of section 5219
of the Revised Statutes of the United States. The defendants
having filed a plea to the jurisdiction and a general demurrer

to the bill, upon motion for a temporary injunction, attempts
to enforce taxes levied or assessed upon the shares of capital
stock at any time previous to March 21, 1900, were enjoined.
103 Fed. Rep. 523.
December 17, 1900, a decree was entered, but not being final

the writ'of error was dismissed. 185 U S. supra. After the
case was sent -back to the Circuit Court the prior decision in
that court Nas followed, and it was further held that the
judgment of the.state .court was not a bar to the right to col-

lect. taxes for other years than the year directly involved in
the judgment set up, and that as the Hewitt law and its ac-

ceptance by the bank had been conclusively held not to constitute an-irrevofable contract as to taxes between the State

and the complainant, and as the law was valid as to future
taxbitiod" the injunction could not be granted as to taxes
.assesed under the law of. March 21, 1900, after its passage.
A decree was, -therefore, .entered,. dismissing the complainant's

COVINGTON v. FIRST NAT. BANK.
198 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JAusTicE DAY, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
That the acceptance of the provisions of the so-called Hewitt
law did not constitute an irrevocable contract, releasing the
bank from taxes upon compliance with its terms, has been
settled. Bank Tax Cases, 102 Kentucky, 174, Citszens' Sav,ingsBank v Owensboro, 173 U S. 63.6. Reference is made to
the various cases leading up to this result m Deposit Bank v
Frankort, 191 U S. 499, 508. We are, therefore, -left upon
this branch of the case to consider the effect of the judgment
of the state court of Kentucky, set up in the complainant's
bill as an adjudication of the rights of the parties and a final
determination that the acceptance of the Hewitt law ad the
effect of a valid contract. When this case was before the
Circuit Court for the second time, 129 Fed. Rep. 792, Judge
Cochran, after an elaborate review of the Kentucky cases,
reached the conclusion that as the taxes involved in the case
in which the adjudication was had were for a different year
than those involved in this suit, the former judgment did not
have the effect of an estoppel between the parties, being only
conclusive, under the Kentucky decisions, as to taxes m the'
years involved in the suit in mich the judgment-was rendered.
We do not doubt that this is the settled law of the Supreme
Court of Kentucky Nor does it make any difference, in the
view which that court takes of the matter, that the adjudication as to the right to collect the taxes involved, the finding
of an exemption by contract, which included not only the taxes
for the years in suit, but all taxes which might be levied under
the authority of the contract. .The ground upon which the
court based its decision with reference to the effect of such
adjudication is stated in the case of City of Newport v Commonwealth, 106 Kentucky, 434, 444; as follows:
"The only question remaining for.decision is upon the plea
-of res 2udicata.
"The-plea in this case avers that the subject matter of the

OCTOBER TIRM, 104.
Opundn of the Court.

198 U. S.

former suit was identical with that involved in this action,
and that the facts were the same inreboth actions, except that
the former action attempted to collect a tax for the year 1893,
and the present action was attempting to collect a tax for the
year 1894.
"The authorities seem to hold that when a court of competent.jurisdiction has, upon a proper issue, decided that a contract, out of which several distinct promises to pay money
arose, has been adjudged invalid in a suit upon one 9f those
pronfises, the judgment is an estoppel to a suit upon another
prohisefounded on the same contract. But taxes do not arise
'1out of contract. They are imposed m rnvitunz. The taxpayer
.does not agree to pay, but i. forced to pay; and the right to.
litigate the legality of a tax upon all grounds must, of necessity
exist, reghrdless. of former adjudications as to the validity of
a different tax."
It is unnecessary to cite the cases; they will be found m
Judge Cochran's opinion. It is.sufficient to say that if this
case had been decided in the state court in Kentucky the adjudication pleaded herein, not involving taxes for the same
years as those now in controversy, would not avail as an estoppel between the parties. It is true 'that a different rule
prevails in the courts of the United States. The reasons therefor were stated in an opinion by Mr. Justice White, speaking
for the court, m the case of New Orleans v Citizens' Bank, 167
U S. 371, and in cases arising in a Federal jurisdiction the
doctrine therein announced will doubtless be adhered to. The
learned counsel for the plaintiff in error refer to the decision of
this court in Deposit Bank v Frankforl, 191 U S. supra, as
authority for the doctrine that where a contract right has been
adjudicated which involves an exemption from all taxation
such adjudication will conclude the parties as to the right to
legally tax for other years, although the particular year was
not directly involved in the suit in which the adjudication was
made. But in that case the court was dealing with the effect
to be given to a judgment of a.Federal court in which such

'COVINGTON t. FIRST NAT BANK.
198 U. S.

Opimon of the Court.

contract right had been adjudicated, when the Federal judgment was set up in a state court, and in that case it was
recogmzed, in the opinion of the court as well as in the dissenting opinion, that the courts of Kentucky, in giving effect
to the judgments of their own courts, were guided by a different rule, and in that State an adjudication involving taxes for
one year cannot be pleaded as an estoppel in suits involving
taxes for other years. 191 U S. 514, 524.
The case of Deposit Bank v Frankbrt was- only concerned
with the dffect to be given to a Federal judgment adjudicating
a contract Tight, when -pleaded in a state court. We are now
dealing with the weight to be attached to a state judgment
when pleaded as res 1.udicata in a Federal court. That was the
very question decided by -this court in the case of Unon &
Planters' Bankc v Memnphis, 189 U S. 71, wherein it was held
that the Federal courts were not required to give to such judgients any greater force or effect than was awarded to them
by the courts .of the State Where they were rendered. Upon
this Lranch of* the case the question then is, What effect is
given in the courts of Kentucky to such pleas of estoppel?
As we have seen, it is there settled that the judgment would
not be effectual to protect the alleged contract rights of the
complainant as to the taxes involved for years other than the
one-directly involved in the adjudication set up. We, therefore, find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court refusing
an mjunctiofi upon the ground of an estoppel by judgment.
As to the taxes for the years prior to the passage of the act
of March 21, 1900, it is argued by the bank that to give this
retroactive effect to the law will be to deprive it and its stockholders of their property without due process of law, and will
&3e in violation of section 5219 of the Revised Statutes, pro"hibiting discrimination against national banks and their stockholders. The act of March 21, 1900, as stated in the preamble,
was passed because of a decision of this court holding prior
legislation of the State under-taking to tax the property of'
national bank8 unconstitutional. Owensboro National Bailk v

OCTOBER TER31, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

198 U. S.

Owensboro, 173 U S. 664. In the Owensboro case it was held
that section 5219, Rev Stat., was the measure of the power
of the State to tax national banks, their property or franchises,
which power was confined to the taxing of the stock in the
name of the shareholders and the assessment of the real estate
of the banks, and that taxation under the laws of the State of
Kentucky upon the franchise of the bank was not within the
purviewof the authority conferred by the act of Congress, and
was therefore illegal. Section 5219 of the Revised Statutes
of the United States is as follows:
"SEC. 5219. Nthing herein shall prevent all the shares in
any association- from being included in the valuation of the
personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in
assessing taxes imposed by authority of the State within which
the associatibn is located, but the legislature of each State may
determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the
shares of national banking associations located within theState, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation
shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other
moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such
State, and that the shares of any national banking association
owned by non-resideits of any State shall be taxed in the city
or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the real property of
associations from either state, county, or municipal taxes, to
the same extent, according to its value, as other real property
is taxed."
Under the new taxing law, act of March 21, 1900, it is declared to be the purpose to require the bank to return the shares
of stock for the years prior to 1900, and since the adoption of
the revenue law of 1892, with the privileges and deductions
stated in section 3 of the act. Notwithstanding the prior
revenue law had been held invalid, and there was no statute
specifically taxing these shares of national bank stock on the
statute books of Kentucky, prior to the passage of the act of
March 21, 1900, the Supreme Court of Kentucky, in the case of

COVIXGTON v. FIRST NAT. BANK.
198 U. S:.

Opunon of the Court.

Scobee v Bean, 109 Kentucky, 526, has' held that there was
ample statute law in that State for the taxing of shares in national banks under the laws of that State providing for the taxation, of real and personal property of every kind, and that the
provision that the individual shareholder in'a.corporation shall
not be required to list his property therein so long as the corporation pays the taxes on its property of every kind, impliedly
requires the individual to list his shares and pay the tax in the
absence of the return required by law of the corporation. In
that case the court held that there was nothing in its decisions
running counter to section 5219. These views were further
enforced in Commonwealth v Citizens' National Bank, 80 S. W
Rep. -158, Town of London v Hope, 80 S. W Rep. 817, Citizens'
National Bank of Lebanon v Commonwealth, 25 Ky L. R. 2254.
Following the state court in the interpretation of its own statutes, it may.,be said that, as to shareholders residing in Kentucky and over whom the State has jurisdiction, the Supreme
Court of that State has construed its statutes as requiring
shareholders in national banks for the years 1893 to 1900,
inclusive, to return their shares for taxation, and if they did not
make the return the duty was required of the corporation. In
this view of the law it may be that, as to local shareholders,
the act of March 21, 1900, as held by the Supreme Court of
Kentucky, created no new.right of taxation, but gave simply
a new remedy, which by the law, is operative to enforce preexisting obligations. It may be admitted that section 5219
permits the State to require the bank to pay the tax for the
shareholders. National Bank v Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353;
Van Slyke v W1isconsin, 154 U S. 581, Aberdeen -Bank v.
Chehialis County, 166 U S. 440.
But there is nothing in the general statutes of Kentucky before the act of March 21, 1900, specifically requiring national
banks to return shares of stock in the corloration when such
shares are held by persons domiciled beyond the State. The

Baltimore, 196 U. S. 466. Section 5219,.Rev Stat., authorizes
the State to tax all the shares of a national banking association, including those owned by non-residents, as well as those
owned m the State, in the city or town where the bank is
located, but this section does not itself ampose the tax; it is
authority for state legislation to thus tax national baik shareholders. And this statute is express authority to the'State by
appropriate legislation to make the bank the agent of the
shareholders for the purpose of returning the shares and pajing the taxes thereon.
.. In Commonwealth v. CitzenWs' Natwnal Bank,. 80 S. W Rep.
158, the Kentucky Court of Appeals seems to. have held that
a national -bank might be required, under ยง 4241, Kentucky
Statutes of 1903, to return the shares held in it for the years
1893 to 1900, inclusive, as omitted property In that case it
is said. "It was held under the previous.statute that the shares
of stock i national banks might be assessed to the shareholder
by the assessor, and should be given in by the shareholder in
the list of his personal propierty Scobee v Bean- 109 Kentucky, 526, S. C., 59 S. W Rep. 860. The act of March 21,
1900, did not, therefore, make that taxable which was not
taxable before, but simply provided another mode for -the
assessment of the shares of stock and the payment ot the taxes.
IUwas the duty of the assessor to make the assessment. It was
also'the duty of the president and cashier of the bank to list
the shares of stock with the assessor; but when the assessment
was not made the property was simply omitted from. the tax
list, and the sheriff is authorized by section 4241, Ky Stat.,
1903, to institute the proceeding to have any omitted property
assessed." And the court further held the bank liable for the
penalty imposed for not listing taxable property The ground

upon which this judgment rests is that shareholders were
bound to return the shares in the years from 1893 to 1900
.under the then existing state likw, and the act of 1900 made the
bank the agent of- the shareholders and did not require a new
duty, but only imposed the duty upon the agent as a means of
making e'fectual the former obligation of the shareholders.
None of the Kentucky eases deals with the. effect of the requirement 'under the act of 1900, that the bank return the
shares of stock held by-foreign stockholders; who clearly were
not required under the previous laws of that State to return
shares of stock when neither the shares nor the owners were
within the State.
Section 5219 requires'that a State-in taxing -national banks
shall be subject to the restriction that the taxation shall not
be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other capital in the
hands of the individual citizen Neither this -section nor section 5210 of the Revised Statutes, requiring a list of the shareholders to be kept by the bank, has the effect to levy taxes.
It is a limitation upon the right of the State, And the State
must not discriminate against national banks by the u*e of
methods of taxation differing from those in use in taxing other
moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens.
It is averred in the amended bill, and the answer having
been stricken from the files and the case submitted upon the
plea to the jurisdiction and general demurrer, it must be taken
as true "th-.t during said years [1893 to 1900] many of its
shareholders were non-resildeits of the State of Kentucky,
who, in iany instances, have sold and transferred their shares
of stock during said time."
The statutes of the State of Kentucky, which have been
construed by the Suprenie Court of that State in the cases cited,
to require the payment of taxes by -the shareholders or by the
bank for its shareholders, can have reference only tc shareholders withm the jurisdiction of the State. Whether the
system operates as a-discriniiation against national banks

right of Federal creation must be ultimately determined in this
court. The act of March 21, 1900, imposes upon the bank a
liability for taxes assessed upon its shareholders, whether
within or without the State. This liability did not exist before
the passage of the act, and in Commonwealth v Citizens' Natwnal Bank, supra, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that
the statutes of the State made the bank liable for a'penalty
of twenty per cent for the years 1893 to 1900, inclusive. It
seems to us that to permit the statute to require the bank to
return the shares of such foreign-held stock, and be subjected
to a penalty in addition, is inposmg upon national banks a
burden not borne by other moneyed capital within the State.
In support of the equivalency of taxation, which it is the purpose of section 5219 to require, this court said, in Owensboro
Nawnal Bank v Owensboro, 173 U S. 664, 676 "The alleged
equivalency, in order to be of any cogency, must of necessity
contain two distinct and essential elements-equivalency in
law and equivalency in fact."
Without considering the question of constitutional power
.to tax non-resident shareholders by means of this retroactive
law, it seems to us that i unposmg upon the bank the liability
for the past years, for taxes and penalty, upon stock held
without the State, and which before the taking effect of the
act under consideration it was not required to return, there
has been imposed upon national banks in this retroactive
feature of the law a burden not borne by other moneyed capital
in. the State. This law makes a bank liable for taxes, upon
property beyond the jurisdiction of the State, not required
to be returned by the bank as agent for the shareholders, by
a statute passed in pursuance of the authority delegated in
ยง 5219, thus imposing a burden not borne by other moneyed
capital within the State.
We think the Circuit Court was right in that part of" the
decree which enjoined the collection of taxes against the bank
for the years 1893 to 1900, inclusive.
As to the alleged discrimination against shareholders in

national banks because the assessment of the property of state
banks is upon the franchise and not upon the shares of stock,
there is nothing in the bill to show that this difference in
method operates to discriminate against'national bank shareholders by assessing their property at higher rates than are
imposed upon capital invested in state banks. And as to the
deduction of the value of real estate and other deductions
allowed to state banks, the Supreme Court of Kentucky has
held that all deductions allowed to state banks must be allowed
in like manner in assessing the property of shareholders in
national banks. Commonwealth v Citizens' Bank, 80 S.W
Rep. 158. Nor does the allegation that in cities of the first,
second and third class state banks are assessed upon their
shares for city taxation, but upon their franchises and property
for state and county taxation, in the absence of averments of
fact showing that thereby a heavier burden of. taxation is
iiposed upon national than state banks in such cities, warrant
