CERTIORARI TO

THE CIRCUIT COURT OP' APPEALS

FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 130. Argued January 16, 17, 1905.-Decded April 24, 1905.
In, an action to restrain the use of a personal name in trade, where it appears that defendant has the right to use fhe name and has not done
anything to promote confusion m the mind of the public except to use
it, complainant's case must stand or fall on the possession of the exclusive
right to the use of the name.
A personal nane-an ordinary family surname such as Remington-cannot
be exclusively appropriated by any one as against others having a right
ivalid
to use it; it is manifetly incapable of exclusive appropriation as a
trade-mark, and its registration as such can not in itself give it.validity.
:Every man has a right to use his name reasonably and honestly in every
way, whether in a firm or corporation; nor is a person obliged to abandon
the use of his name or to unreasonably restrict it:
It is not the use, but dishonesty in the use, of the name thqt is condemned,
and it is a question of evidence in each case whetker there is false representation or not.
One corporation cannot restrainanother, from using in its corporate title
a name to which others have a common-right.
Where persons or corporatiows have a right to. use a name courts will not
interfere where .the only confusion results from a similarity of names

and not from the manner of the use. The essence of the wrong in unfair.
competition consists in the sale of the goods of one person for that,of
another, and if defendant is not attemptine to palm off its goods as those
of complainant the action fails.
THIS was a bill exhibited, in September, 1898, by Wyckoff,
Seamans & Benedict, a. corporation of New'York, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Vermont,
against the Howe Scale Company of 1886, a corporation-of
Vermont, alleging that complainant had been for many years
engaged in the manufacture and sale of typewriting machines
known in the markets and to the trade and public, -nd referred
to, identified, offered for sale and sold as the "Remington
typewriter," and the "Remington standard typewriter," and
that the words "Remington" and "Remington standard"
had been registered in the Patent Office under the act of
Congress; and charging defendant with fraud and.unfair competition in making use of the corporate name "RemingtonSholes Company" and the designations "Remmgton-Sholes,"
"Rem-Sho" and "Remmigton-Sholes Company," in advertising for sale, offering for sale and selling typewriting machines;
and praying for an accounting, and for an injunction restraining defendant from advertising or offering for sale or selling
typewriting machines manufactured by the" Remmgton-Sholes
Company," bearing the name "Remington" or "RemingtonSholes" or "Rem-Sho" or "Remington-Sholes Company,"
and from advertising or offering for sale or selling any such
machines under said designation, or under any designation of
which the name "Remington" was a part.
Defendant was the sales agent of the "Remmgton-Sholes
Company," a corporation of Illinois, and was engaged in selling the typewriting machines called the "Remington-Sholes"
or "Rem-Sho" typewriter, which were manufactured by tih
Illinois corporation at Chicago. The right to use those designations in the way they were used was asserted by tlh6 defense, of which the Remington-Sholes Company, and subsequently the Fay-Sholes Company, had charge. The word

"Reni-Sho" was.alleged to have been registered in the Patent
Office as a trade-mark.
The Circuit Court found that defendant's use of the name
"Remington" was an unjustifiable invasion of complainant
right to the use of that name, and entered a decree, August-14,
1901, denying an account for gains and profits, without prejudice to the recovery thereof from the Remmgton-Sholes Company; and perpetually enjoining the use of the designation
"Remington," or "Rem-Sho," as the name or part of the name
of any typewriting machine whatsoever manufactured by the
"Remmgton-Stioles Company," or by defendant, or any person
or. concern, and from selling, offering or advertising for sale
imany manner, typewriting machines so manufactured "under
the name. of or as 'Remington-Sholes' or 'Rem-Sho,' or by
any designation of which the word 'Remington' or the abbreViation 'Rem' shall constitute a part." 110 Fed. Rep. 520.
The case was -arried by appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals forvthe-.Second Circuit, and was there heard before Circuit Judges-Wallace, Lacombe and Coxe. April 20, 1903, the
decree was reversed, without costs, and the cause remanded
"with instructions-to decree in favor of complainant only as
i6 the name 'Remington.' " Lacombe, J., delivered an opm,on in support of that decree, Coxe, J., concurring in the conlsibn because '"unable to distinguish this cause from Rogers
*vRogers, 70 Fed. Rep. 1017;" Wallace, J., dissented, holding
that the deeree- of the Circuit Court should be reversed with
instructions to dismiss the bill. 122 Fed. Rep. 348.
It.-appeared that the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals was issued April 22, 1903, and that the Circuit Court
.ntered a final decree, June 22, 1.903, enjoining the use of the
Word "Remington," and also that after the original- decree of
the Circuit Court the Reminmgton-Sholes Company changed its
corporate name to that of Fay-Sholes Company, and ceased
to make-it. machines marked with the registered trade-mark
'"Rem-Sho," and with the mscription "Remmgton-Sholes
;Company, Mfr.; Chicago."

Statement of the Case.

It also appeared that m October, 1901, complainant filed its
bill in the Circuit Court of, the United States for the Northern
District of Illinois against the Remington-Sholes Company,
for alleged unfair trade competition, and that, after answer
filed, an order was entered staying proceedings until the determination of this cause, and providing that if this cause
resultedf'in favor of complainant, that cause should be sent
at once to an accounting.
On petition of the Howe Scale Company of 1886, and the
Fay-;Sholes Company, filed October 22, 1903, and on petition
of Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict, filed December 21, 1903,
writ and cross writ of certiorari were granted.
For some years prior to 1860 E. Remington and his three
sons were engaged at Ilion, New York, in the manufacture of
firearms under the firm name of E. Remington & Sons. The
father died m 1863, and in 1865 the sons, who had continued
the business, organized the corporation E. Remington & Sons
under the laws of New York. About 1866 E. Remington &
'Sons produced a breech-loading rifle that obtained great vogue
throughout' the world, and was and is known as "The Remingtori Rifle." The "Remington Sewing Machine" and other
machines were also manufactured and sold.
In 1873 E. Remington & Sons began the manufacture of a
typewriting machine, the most important features of which
were invented and patented by Christopher Latham Sholes.
It was the pioneer writing machine and -called "The Typewriter," and "The Sholes and Glidden Typewriter," and in
1880 the names "Remington" and "Remington Standard"
were used instead, as they have since been- continuously
One of complainant's witnesses testified that the typewriter
was called "Remington" "for the reason that the name Remington was known the world over, owing to their building guns
for foreign governments, building sewing machines, and having
one of the largest manufacturng works in the world." In
March, 1886, the typewriter branch of the business of E. Remington & Sons was sold to Messrs. Wyckoff, Seamans & Bene-

diet, and there was also transferred the exclusive right to the
name "Standard Remington Typewriter," by which name the
assignment states the machines were generally known. The
assignment contained the express reservation to E. Remington
& Sons of the right to engage in the manufacture and /sale of
typewriters at any time after ten years from its date.
Complainant's typewriting machines have been for years
conspicuously marked with the name "Remington" and with
a large "Red Seal" trade-mark on the paper table and frame,
the name and address "Remington Standard Typewriter,
manufactured by Wyckoff, Seamans and Benedict, Ilion,
N. Y., U' S. A.," on the cross bar in front of the key board,
the words and figures "No. 6 Remington Standard Typewriter
No. 6" on the front of the base, and the words "This machine
is protected by 67 American and foreign patents" on the back.
"Remington" and "Remington Standard" and the "Red
Seal" have all been registered by complainant as trade-marks.
In 1892 Z. G. Sholes, a son of Christopher Latham Sholes,
invented a typewriting machine, and early in 1893 the Z-. G.
Sholes Company was organized under the laws of Wisconsin
fTr its manufacture, but the stock of the company was never
issued, and no machine was ever made or sold by it. Later
in the year Franklin and Carver Remington, sons of Samuel
Remington, formerly president of the E. Remington & Sons
corporation, bought a three-fourths interest in Sholes' invention, Sholes retaining one-fourth, and a like interest in the
stock of the company, paying from eight to nine thousand
dollars. They entered into a written agreement with Sholes,
which provided, among other things, that "no further, other
or different business of any kind or niture shall be transacted
by said corporation or in its behalf, except that the saiime may
be dissolved, in (hue form of law, as soon as practicable hereafter." Franklin Remington gave his entire time to the promotion of the enterprise, and advanced for expdnses from six
to seven thousand dollars in addition to the original -investment of eight or nine thousand. The name_ of /the machine

was subsequently changed by Sholes from "The Z. G. Sholes"
to "The Remmgton-Sholes." Thereafter the Remmgtons and
Sholes induced Head and Fay of Chicago to furnish funds to
manufacture the Remmgton-Sholes machine, and a corporation organized in the spring of 1894 for its manufacture was
designated the "Remington-Sholes Typewriter Company"
This company purchased tools and machinery, and its typewriting machines were placed on the market in December,
1894. In the fall of 1896 the company had become so deeply
indebted "that it became necessary to take steps to meet its
obligations, and at a meeting of the stockholders December 14, 1896, it was resolved that the property and assets be
sold at public auction, the buyer to have the privilege of using
all or any part of the company's corporate name. Thereupon
Fay purchased in his own name, but as trustee for himself and
other stockholders, the whole of the assets of the company,
together with. its good will, the exclusive right to use its trademarks, etc., and for some months carried on the business at
the factory formerly occupied by the Remington-Sholes Typewriter Company The charter of that company was surrendered in April, 1897, and the Remmgton-Sholes Company was
incorporated under the laws of Illinois, and purchased all the
assets, gQod will, trade-marks, trade names, etc., theretofore
belonging to Fay and the Remington-Sholes Typewriter Company And the new company continued at the same factory
and through the same, instrumentalities to manufacture and
sell its typewriters. It was stipulated that the common stock
in the new company "was divided among the stockholders in
keeping with the amounts of cash actually invested by them
in the Remington-Sholes Typewriter Company, and that the
allotment of said common stock to said Franklin Remington
was in keeping with such. plan."
The machines made and sold by the Remington-Sholes
Typewriter Company were plainly marked with the words
"Remington-Sholes, Chicago.' After the new company entered on the business the trade-mark "Rem-Sho" was adopted

(registered as, a trade-mark October 19, 1897), and the machines were also marked' on the cross bars with the words
"Remmgton-Sholes Company, Mfrs., Chicago." The Remington-Sholes Typewriter Company widely advertised that its
machine "was not the Remington Standard Typewriter," and
the catalogues"circulated by the Remington-Sholes Company
declared. "We state, then, emphatically that this company
has no connection whatever with that well-known and excellent machine, the Remington Standard Typewriter, and
caution possible customers against confusing the 'Rem-Sho'
with that machine or any other."

whom Mr James H. Peirce and Mr William Henry Dennis

A personal name, such as the name "Remington," is incapable of exclusive appropriation, and its registration in the

A man's name is his own property and he has the same
right to its use and enjoyment as he has to that of any other
species of property, the only restriction imposed by this court
upon the use of a personal name being that it shall be a reasonable, honest and fair exercise of such right. Brown Chemical Co. v Myer; McLean v Fleming; Singer Mig. Co. v June

To a personal name (or like generic name) no secondary
signification can attach that will diminish the right of any
one bearing such name to use it"m every honest way and for,

every legitimate purpose, and where a personal or generic
name has acquired a secondary signification, the most that
can be required of a person having a right to use such name
is that he shall accompany its use "with such indications as
to show that the thing manufactured is the work of the one
making it." Holzapfte Co. v. Rahtiens Co., 183 U. S. 1, Baker

In cases like that at bar the ground of relief is the injury
to a complainant by the passing off of defendant's wares for
those of complainant, and. where a complainant invariably
marks his wares with his name, address and a designating
mark, the fact that a defendant has invariably marked hms
wares with his own name and address and -with a, different
distinctive mark, is most persuasive of the absence of any
intent to pass off his wares as and for complainant's. Cases

The courts have uniformly recognized that a man's use of
his name in a firm name is a reasonable, honest and legitimate
use. Natwnal Starch Mfg. Co. v Duryea, 101 Fed. Rep. 117,

It being a general custom to employ personal names for
corporations, no distinction can be made between the use of
such names in a firm and m a corporation, since in both cases
the names adopted -are selected and artificial. Baker v Baker,

The courts recognize that the business of a corporation or
of a firm in which a man has his capital invested, and to which
he devotes his whole time and energy is his business, and that
he has a right to use his name m connection therewith.
Although it is true that there is no necessity for a man
engaged in a corporation or m a firm to employ his name
in connection therewith-since both firm and corporate names
are alike artificial-this lack of necessity for using a personal
name cannot affect the individual's right to so use it, because
such use is a universally recognized legitimate and reasonable
use of a personal name. Turton & Sons v Turton & Sons,

name in the selection of a firm name and in its business. In
this case defendant has never imitated complainant's signs,
labels -or other indicia, nor trespassed upon its good will,
which complainant owns, but has simply availed in an honest
way of the family reputation, which complainant does not own,
of Mr. Franklin Remington, the general manager of the Remington-Sholes Company See German decisions regarding
name "Remmgton-Sholes," in Newald v Glogowski & Co.,
rendered by the Koenigliches Kammergericht, July 3, 1897,

In considering a corporate name comprising one or morepersonal names, the impression is different from that conveyed, under certain circumstances, by a corporate name involving geographical or purely fanciful names. In such latter
cases the public may assume that the corporation having the
double name is a consolidation of two corporations, but even
in such cases the courts have frequently refused to grant mjunctions. against defendants bearing the double names.

a connection between such company and complainant, the use

Where a name is incapable of -exclusive appropriationlike the name Remigton-a court will not destroy the rightof another to use such name but will direct its injunctive
process against the specific abuse of the right, if any such has
occurred. The.sweepmg decrees of the lower courts in the
case at bar are therefore manifestly in error.. Singer Mfg. Co.

That defendant m the case at bar has not been guilty of
any unfair trade competition (unless the use of the name
"Remmgton-Sholes" be- so regarded) is conclusively established by the record and has been unanimously so held by the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
The record being devoid of any showing that there'has ever
been any deception or mistake or injury to complainant by
reason of the use. of the name "Rem-Sho," this court will not
disturb the unanimous finding of the Court of Appeals allowing defendant's right to use such fanciful name.
Rem-Sho is a fanciful name and can be trade-marked.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE

Referring to the Remington-Sholes Company, it was unammously held by the Circuit Court of Appeals: "We do not find
in this voluminous record sufficient evidence that defendant
has itself done anything to promote confusion in the minds
of the public, except to use the name 'Remington' on its
machines and in its literature."
Accepting that conclusion, it follows that complainant's case
must stand or fall on the possession of the exclusive right to the
use of the name "Remington."
But it is well settled that a personal name cannot be exclusively appropriated by any one as against others having a
right to use it, and as the name "Remington" is an ordinary
family surname, it was manifestly incapable of exclusive appropriation as a valid trade-mark, and its registration as such

HOWE SCALE CO. v. WYCKOFF, SEAMANS &c. 135
198 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

could not in itself give it validity Brown Chemscal Company
v Meyer, 139 U S. 540; Singer Manufactunng Company v
June Manufacturng Company, 163 U S. 169; Elgin National
Watch Company-v Illinois Watch Case Company,'179 U S 665.
The general rule and the restrictions upon it are thus stated
in Brown Chemical Company v Meyer There plaintiff had
adopted as a trade-mark for its medicine the words "Brown's
Iron Bitters," and the defendants used upon their medicine
the words "Brown's Iron Tonic." This court, after commenting upon the descriptive character of the words "Iron
Tonic," and confirming the defendants' right to the use -of
these, said.
"It'is hardly necessary to say that an ordinary surname
cannot be appropriated as a trade-mark by any one person as
against others of the same name, who are using it for a legitimate purpose, although cases are not wanting of injunctions
to restrain the use even of one's own name where a fraud ipon
another is manifestly intended, or where he has assigned or
parted with. his right to use it."
And, after citing numerous authorities, Mr. Justice -Brown,
delivering the opinion, continued.
"These cases obviously apply only where the defendant
adds to his own name imitation of the plaintiff's labels, boxes
or packages, and thereby induces the public to believe that
his goods are those of the plaintiff. A man's name is his own
property, and he has the same right to its use and enjoyment
as he has to that of any other species of property If such use
be a.reasonable, honest and fair exercise of such right, he is
no more liable for the incidental damage he may do a rival in
trade than he would be for an injury to his neighbor's property
by the smoke issuing from his chimney, or for the fall of his
neighbor's house by reason of necessary excavations upon his
own lands. These and similar instances are cases of damnum
absque tnjura."
In Singer Mfg. Co. v June Mfg. Co., 163 U. S. 169, the rule
is thus laid down by Mr. Justice White:

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opimon of the Court.

198 U. S.

"Although 'every one has the absolute-right to use his own
name honestly in his own business, even though he may thereby
incidentally interfere with and injure the business of another
havmg the same name, in such case the mconvenience or
loss to which those having a common right are subjected is
damnum absque -inmura. But although he may thus use his
name he cannot resort to any artifice, or do any act calculated
to mislead the public as to the identity of the business firm or
establishment, or of the article produced by them, and thus
produce injury to the other beyond that which results from
the similarity of name.' "
In the present case, the decree enjoined the use, "in any
manner whatpoever," "of the designation 'IRemington' as the
name, or part of the name, of any typewriting machme, whatsoever manufactured by the Remmgton-Sholes Company;- or
by defendant or any person or concern, anid.fronaselling; offering, exposing or advertising for sale by xileans of-,Rgns, show
cards, catalogues, circulars, publications, advertisements or
by word of mouth, or in -any manner whatsoever, typewriting
machines manufactured by said Remimgton-Sholes Company
or by defendant, or any person or concern under the name of
or as 'Remmgton-Sholes,' or by any designation of which the
word Remington shall constitute a part." This denies the
right to use the personal name, rather than aims to correct an
abuse of- that right, and involves the assertion of the proposition that-the use of a,family name by a corporation stands on
a different footing from its use by individuals or firms. But if,.
every man his the right"to use his name reasonably and honestly, in eyery way, we cannot -perceive any practical distinction between the use of the name in a firm and its use in a
corporation. It is dishonesty in the use that is condemned,
whether in a partnership' or corporate name, and not the use
itself.
Goodyear's India.Rubber Glove Manufacturtng Company v
Goodyear Rubber Company, 128 U S. 598, was a suit by a corporation of New York against a corporation of Connecticut,

HOWE SCALE CO.. v. WYCKOFF, SEAMANS &c. 137

to restrain, the use in bi'siness of the name." Goodyear's Rubber
Manufactmirng Cdmpany;" or any equivalent name. It was
held that "Goodyear Rubber" described well known classes of
goods produced by the process known as Goodyear's invention,
and that such descriptive names could not be exclusively appropnated. And Mr. Justice. Field, delivering the opinion,
said. "Names of such articles caninot be adopted as trademarks, and be thereby appropriated to the exclusive right ofany one; nor will .the incorporation of a company in the name
of an article of commerce, without other specification, create
any exclusive right to the use of the name."
The principle that one corporation is not entitled to restrain another from using in its corporate title a name to which
others have a common right, is sustained by the discussion in
Columba Mill Company v Alcorn, 150 U S. 460, and is, we
think, necessarily applicable to all names public? uns. Amercan Cereal Company v Eli Pettijohn Cereal Company, 72

Monarch v Rosenfeld, 39 S. W Rep. 236.
It is said that the use of the word "Remington" in the name
"Remmgton-Sholes" was unnecessary, as if necessity were the
absolute test of the right to use. But a person is not obliged
to abandon the use of his name or to unreasonably restrict it.
Thq question is whether his use is reasonable and honest, oris calculated to deceive.
"It is a question of evidence in each case whether there is
false representation or not." Burgess *v Burgess, 3 .DeG.
M..& G. 896.
The Circuit Court of Appeals in the present case quotes with
approval from the concurring opinion of Wallace, J., in R. W
Rogers Company v William Rogers Mfg. Co., 70 Fed. Rep.
1017, that "a body of associates who organize a corporation for
,aanufacturing and-selling a particular product are not lawfully entitled tu employ as their corporate name in that business IIIe name of one of their number when it appears that such

name has-been intentionally selected in order to compete with
an established concern of the same.name, engaged in similar
business, and divert the latter's trade to themselves by confusing the identity of ,the products of both, and leading purchasers to buy those of one for those of the other.
The corporators chose the name unnecessarily, and, having
done so for the purpose of unfair competition, cannot be permitted to use it to tie injury of the complainant."
This, of course, assumes not only that the name selected
was calculated to deceive, but that the selection was made
for that purpose.
In Turton andSons v Turton and Sdns, 42 Ch. Div 128,
plaintiffs had carried on the iron business as "Thomas Turton
and Sons." Defendant began the same business as John
Turton, then traded as John Turton and Co., and finally took
m his sons and changed the firm name to "John Turton and
Sons." Some confusion had arisen, and plaintiffs contended
that there was Aio necessity for defendants to use their own
names.
Lord Esher said. "Therefore the proposition goes to this
length, that if a man is in business and has so carried on his
business that his. name has become a value in the market,
another man must -not use his own name. If that other man
comes and carries on business he must discard his own name
and take. a false name. The proposition seems to me so
monstrous that the statement of it carries its own refutation."
And Lord Macnaghi~n said-in Reddaway v Banham,L. R. Appeal.Cases, 1896, 199, 220 "I am quite at a loss to know why
Turton.v Turton was ever reported. The plaintiff's case there
was extravagant and absurd." And see Meneely v Meneely,
62"N. Y 427 ;,Meden Co. v Parker,39 Connecticut, 450,

The formation of a corporation as an effective form of busi-

HOWE SCALE CO. v. WYCKOFF, SEAMANS &c. 139
198 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ness enterprise was not only reasonable in itself, but the usual
means in the obtaining of needed capital. And as Wallace, J.,
said'. "It was natural that those who had invented the machine,
and given all their time and means in introducing it to the.
public, when they came to organize the corporation which was
to represent the culmination of their hopes and efforts, should
choose their own name as the corporate name. In -doing so I
think they were exercising only the common privilege that
every man has to use his own name in his own business, provided it is not chosen as a cover for unfair competition. They.
did not choose the complainant's name literally, or so closely
that those using ordinary discrimination would confuse the
identity of the two names, and that differentiation is sufficient
to relieve them of any imputation of fraud."
The name "Remington-Sholes Company" is not identical
with, or an imitation of, "Remington Standard Typewriter
Company," or "Remington Typewriter Company," or "E.
Remington 4nd Sons." Defendant's marks "Rem-Sho,"
"Remington-Sholes Co., Mfrs., Chicago," are not identical
with, or an imitation of, complainant's marks "Remington,;"
Large Red Seal, "Remington Standard Typewriter, manufactured by Wyckoff, Seamans and Benedict, Ilion, N. Y.,
U S. A.", "Remington Standard Typewriter.'"
The use of two distinct surnames clearly differentiated the
machines of defendant from those of complainant, and when
defendant's cards, signs, catalogues, instructions- to agents,
etc., are considered, it seems to us that the record discloses,
to use the language of Mr. Justice Field in the Goodyear case,
a persistent" effort on defendant's part "to call the attention
of the public to its own manufactured goods, and the places
where they are to be had, and that it has no connection with
the plaintiff." Doubtless the Remingtons and Sholes, in using
the name "Remmgton-Sholes," desired to avail themselves of
the general family reputation attached to the two names, but
that does not in itself justify the assumption that their purpose
was to confuse their machines with complamant's; or that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

use of that name was in itself calculated to deceive. Remington and Shdles were interested in the old company, and Remington continued as general manager of the new company.
Neither of them was paid for the use of his name, and neither
of them had parted with the right to that use. Having the
right to that use, courts will not interfere where the only confusion, if any, results from a similarity of the names und not
from the manner of the use. The essence of the wrong in
unfair competition consists in the sale of the goods of one
manufacturer or vendor for those of another, and if defendant
so conducts its business as not to palm off its goods as those
of complainant, the action fails.
As'observed by Ivr. Justice Strong in the leading case of
Canal Company v Clark, 13 Wall. 311. "Purchasers may be
mistaken, but they are not deceived by false representations,
and equity will not enjoih against telling -the truth." And by
Mr. Justice Clifford, in McLean v Fleming, 96 U S. 245 "A
court-of equity will not interfere when ordinary attention by
the purchaser of the article would enable him at once to discrimunate the one fromthe other." And by Mr. Justice Jackson 'in Columbta Mills Companzy v Alcorn, 150 U S. 460:
"Even in the case of a valid trade-mark, the similarity of brands
must be such as to mislead the ordinary observer." And see
Coats v Merrwm Thread Company, 149 U S.562; Ltggett &
Myers Tobacco Company v Finzer, 128 U S. 182.
We hold that, in the absence of contract, fraud or estoppel,
any man may use his own name, in all legitimate ways, and
as the whole or a part of a corporate name. And, in our view,
defendant's name and trade-mark were not intended or likely
to deceive, and there was nothing of substance shown in defendant's conduct in their use constituting unfair competition,
or calling for the mposition of restrictions lest actionable injury
might result, as may confessedly be done in a proper case.
Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, decree of Circuit
Court also reversed, and cause remanded to that court with
a direction to dismiss the bill.
