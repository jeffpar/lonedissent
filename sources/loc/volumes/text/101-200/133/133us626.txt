by the plaintiff; and the plaintiff has exhausted her remedy
against the mortgagor personally, by recovering judgment
against him, execution upon which has been returned unsatisfied.
Although the mortgagor might properly have been made a
party to this bill, yet as no objection was taken on that ground
at the hearing, and the omission to make him a party cannot
prejudice any interest of his, or any right of either party to
this suit, it affords no ground for refusing relief. Mkechanics'

No. 136.

Argued November 26,27, 1889.-Decided March 3,1890.

Where appeals by five defendants from a final decree were allowed in open
court in October, 1885, and the amount of the supersedeas bond as to
one of them was fixed at $100, but he never gave it, and the others perfected their appeal, and the record was filed in this court in October,
1886, and, when the case came on for hearing in November, 1889, he
asked leave to file a proper bond, it was granted nunc..pro tune as of the
day of hearing.
S. gave two deeds of teust of a lot of land in the District of Columbia to
secure loans made by P. Afterwards he gave a deed of trust of the same
lot to secure a loan made by C., that deed covering also a lot in the rear of
the first lot, and fronting on a side street. At the time all the deeds were
given, there was a dwelling-house on the premises, the main part of
which was on the first lot,.but some of which was on the rear lot. P.,
on an allegation that B., a trustee in each of the first two deeds, had
refused to sell the property covered by them, filed a bill asking the
appointment of a trustee in place of those appointed by the first two
deeds. The suit resulted in a decree appointing a new trustee in place
of B., " In the deed of trust," but not identifying which one. The new
trustee and the remaining old one then sold th3 land at auction to F.,

P. filed a cross bill to confirm it. The bill was dismissed. P. then filed.
this bill against S. and C., and all necessary parties, to have a trustee
appointed to sell the land covered by the three trust deeds, and the
improvements on it, to have a receiver of the rents appointed, and to
have the rents and the proceeds of sale applied first to pay P. A receiver
was appointed, and a decree made for the sale of te entire property, as
a whole, by trustees whom the decree appointed, and for the ascertainment by the trustees of the relative values of the land covered by the
first two trust deeds and the improvements $hereon, and of the rear
piece of land and the improvements thereon, and for the paymetit to P.
of the net proceeds of sale representing the value of the land and improvements covered by. the first two trust deeds, less the bxpenses
chargeable thereto, and of the residue to C., and, out of the rents, to P.,
what he had paid for taxes and insurance premoums, and for a personal
decree against S., in favor of P., for. any deficiency in the proceeds of
sale to pay the claims of P.; Held,
(1) It was the intention of both S. and P. that the first two deeds of
trust should include the rear land as well as the front lot;
(2) The decree in the first suit by P. was so uncertain as to be practically void, and there was no effective appointment of atrustee
and no effective sale to P.;
(3) P. was not estopped by that sale from having the property sold.

(4) P. was not required, as a condition of the sale of the rear lot, to pay
the whole of the debt due to C,; and the case was a proper one
for selling the property as an entirety;
(5) It was, also, a proper one for the appointment of a receiver of the
rents, and those rents in the hands of the recelv~r, after paying
charges, ought to go to make up any deficiency In the proceeds of
sale to satisfy the corpus of all the secured debts, and ought to be
first applied to pay any balance due to P.;
(6) Under § 808 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of
Columbia a decree in personam for a deficiency is a necessary incddent of a foreclosure suit in equity;
(7) As the notes secured by the deeds of trust bore interest at the rate

.of Washington, in the District of Columbia, described in 4he
deed as followvs: "Part of lot numbered two (2) in square
numbered one hundred and sixty-four (164), and bounded and
described as follows, viz. : Beginning at a point on Nor.th K
Street forty-three feet and nine inches (43-& ft.) east of the southwestern corner of said square, and running, thence west on ]
Street forty-three feet and nine inches (43- ft.), to said southwestern corner of d square; thence noirthwesterly along the
line of Connecticut Avenue about eighty feet and ten inches
(80-- ft.), to.the south line of original lot numbered three (3)
in said square; thence northeasterly and at right angles with
said avenue and along 'the line of said lot three (3), about
eighty-five (85) feet, to intersect a line drawn due north froni
the point of beginning, and thence due south to the point of
beginning." The deed recited that Shepherd was .indebted
to George S. Pepper.in the sum of $35,000, evidenced by a
promissory note executed to Pepper, dated June 1, 1874,and
payable in five years after date, With interest, payable semiannually, at the rate of nine per cent per annum, until paid'
accompanied by 10 coup6n notes for $1575 each, representing'
the interest; and it conveyed the land in trust, to secure th6
payment of the notes. It gave power to the trustees to sell
the premises at public auction, on a default in the payment
of the notes or any instalment of interest, and to co'vey the
property in fee simple to the purchaser. Shepherd cavenanted
in the deed to kee1 the buildings on the land insured during
the continuance of the trust in the sum of $25,000, and to
have the policies assigned to the trustees; and that, on hig
failure to do so, Pepper might do it and the premium he
should pay should be oonsidered as secured by the-trust deed.
On the 22d of March, 18.75, Shepherd and his wife executed
to William F. Mattingly and the said Andrew C. Bradley another deed of trust, covering the same premises by the same
description as in the first deed, to secure the payment to the
said Pepper of a promissory note dated March 22, 1875, for
$10,000, payable five years after date, with interest, payabl&
semi-annually, at the rate of nine per cent per annum, until
paid, accompanied by 10 coupon notes of $150 each, represent.

ing the interest. The other provisions of this trust deed were
in terms like those of the first one, except that the insurance
against fire was to be $10,000.
On the 15th of May, 1876, Shepherd and his wife executed
a deed of trust to James E. Fitch and Lewis J. Davis, covering premises described as follows: "All that certain piece or
parcel of ground situate and lying in the city of Washington,
District of Columbia, and known and described upon the
ground plat or plan of said city as lot number three (3), in A.
R. Shepherd's subdivision of square number one hundred and
sixty-four (164), said lot number three (3), fronting forty-three
feet and nine inches (43 ft. 9 in.) on K Street N. W., and one
hundred and. nine feet and one-half inch (109 ft. -21in.) on
Connecticut Avenue." The deed was made to secure the
payment of a promissory note for $35,000, made by Shepherd,
dated May 15, 1876, given to M]rcy. Maria Carter, payable
three years after date with interest at the rate of nine per
cent per annum, payable quarterly.
This deed covered
the same premises embraced in the first two deeds of trust,
and an additional piece of land in the rear of those premises,
having a frontage on Connecticut Avenue of 28 feet 29
inches, and running eastward across the rear part of the premises covered by the first two deeds of trust.
On the 15th of November, 1876, Shepherd and his wife
executed an assignment, for the benefit of the creditors of
Shepherd, to George Taylor, Henry A. Willard, and Samuel
Cross, which assignment covered "lot 3 in square 164." Willard refused to accept the trust, and Peter F. Bacon was duly
appointed assignee in his place.
On the 11th of April, 1878, Pepper filed a bill in equity, in
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, making as
defendants Shepherd and his wife, Bradley, Philip, Mattingly,
Taylor, Cross and Bacon. The bill set forth the making and
contents of the two deeds of trust in favor of Pepper and of
the assignment by Shepherd; that Pepper was still the
holder of the note for $35,000 and the note for $10,000, and
the coupon notes belonging thereto; that there were large
nrreaxs of interest due thereon; that the property was largely

Opinion of the Court.

encumbered with taxes, and had been sold for the taxes -for
the year ending June 30, 1877; that Shepherd had failed t9
keep the property insured, and Pepper had advanced the
amount of -the premiums of insurance: that Pepper had, in
writing, requested the trustees, under the deeds of trust, to
advertise the property for sale, but the defendant Bradley, a
trustee under each of the deeds, had refused to do so, by a
letter to Pepper, in which he also stated "that the trust does
not cover the entire area of the house, cutting off about twenty
feet of the rear."
There was and is a dwelling-house on the land, which covers
the entire width on K Street, and at least a part of it extends
the entire depth of the land embraced in the first two deeds of
trust; and a part of the rear part of it is built upon the land
covered by the deed of trust in favor of Mercy Maria Carter
which is not embraced in the two deeds of trust in favor of
Pepper.
The bill averred that at the time the two loans were Pegotiated by Pepper he was informed and believed that the two
deeds of trust covered the whole of the house and lots; that
he had nothing to do with the preparation of those deeds, but
they were prepared by Shepherd or his attorney ; that Pepper'
never saw them until after the negotiations were concluded
and the money paid; that Shepherd alone was responsible for
any mistake or omission; that at the dates of the *deeds of
trust the house was completed and occupied by Shepherd
as a dwelling; that sub-lot A in square -161, being the
premises not covered by the two deeds of trust in favor*of
Pepper, was at that time owned by Shepherd;. that it wasunderstood that the two deeds of trust in favor of Pepper
would and did cover the whole area occupied by the house and
grounds; that the part of the house not included in those two
deeds of trust was what is known as the "picture gallery;"
that the rear end of it could be detached without marring ,or
lessening the value of the property; that the plaintiff was
entitled to enforce the collection of the moneys due to him,
irrespective of any injury which the sale might do to Shepherd
or any one holding under him; and that, in any event, the

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff had the right .to enforce the sale of so much of the
property as was, covered by the two deeds of trust in his
favor.
The prayer of the bill was that a trustee might, be appointed by the court in place of the trustees under the two
deeds of trust, with directions and authority forthwith to execute the trusts of the two deeds.
Answers to this bill were put in by Mattingly, Bradley and
Shepherd, the answer of Shepherd setting up that the loans to
him by Pepper were usurious and void under the laws of the
State of Pennsylvania, which governed the contracts. Issue
was joined, proofs were taken, and the case was heard at
special term, which, on the 12th of May, 1879,. entered a
decree overruling the defence of usury, and further decreeing
as follows; "That James M. Johnston be, and is hereby;
appointed trustee in the place and stead of Andrew C. Bradley in the deed of trust, and recorded in Liber, folio
of the land records for the District of Columbia, and referred
to in the record in this cause. This decree, is without prejudice to all other rights of defendant." Shepherd, on the 14th
of May, 1879, appealed from this decree to the general term;
but, after the sale to Pepuer hereinafter mentioned, he dismissed his appeal.
Johnston and Philip, claiming and purporting to act under
the deed of trust of June 1, 1874, and regarding Johnston as
having been appointed trustee in the place of Bradley, under
that deed, by virtue of the decree of May 12, 1879, advertised
for sale at public auction the premises described in that deed,
by, thedescription contained in it. The sale took place on the
23d of October, 1879, and the property was sold to Pepper, at
such auction, for $50,000; and Philip and Johnston as trustees, executed and delivered to Pepper a deed of the property.
On the 14th of November, 1879, Shepherd filed a bill in
equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,
against Philip, Johnston, and Pepper, setting forth the sale
and the deed to Pepper, and alleging that Johnston and Philip
acted without authority in selling the property, inasmuch as
Johnston was not a trustee under the deed of trust, and the

SH PHERD v. PEPPER.
Opinion of.the Court.

decree of May 12, 1879, did not confer upon-him any power
under that deed, nor substitute him in the place of Bradley
under it, nor remove Bradley from his office of trustee under
it; that it was annodneed at the sale by the auctioaeer that'
the sale was -made subject to taxes estimated at 2700, and
that the lot sold did not include the rear part of the buildibg ;
that the property was knocked down to Pepper for $50,000
and the said taxes;. that the price was grossly inadequate;
that Shepherd, at the time of the sale, was the owner of a valuable equitable interest in the property; and that the sale was
void.
The prayer of the bill was that the sale be set aside and the
deed to Pepper cancelled; that the defendants be restrained
from interfering with the property, or attempting to enforce at
law any legal right claimed as a consequence of the sale or the
deed; and for general relief.
Philip and Johnston answered the bill, as also did Pepper.
Pepper also filed a cr6ss-bill against Shepherd, Philip and
Johnston, setting forth the contents of the original bill and ,of
the answers to it, and praying that the sale to Pepper be -decreed to be legal and valid, and the deed to him effectual to
convey to- him an unencumbered fee simple title to the real
estate ; for a writ of assistance to put him in possession of the
premises; for a receiver to collect the accruing rents; f6r an
injunction to restrain Shepherd and all persons claiming under
him from interfering with the plaintiff in respect of the premises and for general relief.
A'replication was filed to the answers to the original bill,
and Shepherd, and also Philip and Johnston, answered the
cross-bill. Issue was joined on such answers and proofs were
taken. The case was heard at special term, and a decree was
made on the 30th of October, 1880, dismissing the bill, wit i
costs, the decree being made by Mr. Justice' James. it stated
that Shepherd appealed to the general term from the decree.
On the 24th of December, 1880, Mr. Justice James filed an
opinion in the suit, in which he stated that the decree of May
12, 1879, in the suit of Pepper against Shepherdi was inoperative and void for uncertainty. He added: "It purports' to

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

,substitute a trustee in one of two deeds mentioned in the
pleadings, without designating which of them. It is true that
it can be inferred, from the comparative effects of the substitution in the one or the other case, that the court was not likely
to intend to substitute I/fr. Johnston for Mr. Bradley in the deed
which conveyed only an equitable title, but I do not think that
I am at liberty to explain and give certainty to the decree by
reference to such considerations. It has been suggested that
a decree may be explained by reference to the pleadings on
which it is based, and this undoubtedly may be done in a
proper case; but I do not find that the uncertainty of the decree in this case can be cleared up in that way. It follows
that, if the decree is uncertain on its face, the alleged title of
Pepper, through Mr. Johnston as substituted trustee, is not a
,cloud upon the title of the complainant, and consequently
this court cannot take jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed.
Therefore, the decree must be that the bill be dismissed."
On the 14th of January, 1881, the defendants in the suit of
Shepherd against Pepper entered an appeal from the decree of
October 30, 1880. On the 11th of February, 1881, Shepherd
dismissed his appeal from that decree. A motion by Shepherd
to dismiss the appeal from that decree taken by the defendants therein, appears to have been granted by default; and
they, on the 25th of February, 1881, filed petitions praying
the court in general term to reinstate their appeal. The
ground of these petitions was, that the opinion of Mr. Justice
James found as a fact that the trustees, Philip and Johnston,
had no power to make a sale, which finding did not appear in
the decree of October 30, 1880. The court acted upon the
petitions for reinstating, by making an order, on the 17th of
June, 18.81; striking from the files of the court the opinion of
Mr. Justice James. This left the decree of the special term,
made October 30, 1880, to stand as a decree merely dismissing
the bill of Shepherd.
On the 20th of July, 1881, Pepper began the present suit by
filing in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia a bill
in equity against Shepherd and his wife; Mercy Maria Carter,
,who had been married and become Mercy Maria Carter Gray;

-SHEPHERD v. PEPPER.
Opinion of the Court.

Fitch and Davis, the trustees in the deed of trust for the benefit of Mrs. Gray; Bradley, Mattingly, and Johnston, tzustees'
(Philip having died); David R. Bartlett, Bacon and Cross,
assignees under the deed of assignment of November 15, 1876,
(Bartlett having been appointed assignee in the place of Taylor); and John Alexander and George M. Barker, two of the
creditors secured by that assignment, as representatives of that
class of creditors.
The bill sets forth the two deeds of trust in favor of Pepper
and the deed of trust in favor of Mrs. Gray. It avers that
Pepper owns and holds the promissory note for $35,000 and
the one for $10,000; that they are both overdue; that a large
'amount of interest is due upon them; that Pepper has advanced moneys on account of taxes and insurance on the
premises covered by the three deeds of trust, which moneys
are secured by the two deeds of trust in his favor; that Mrs.
Gray still holds her promissory note for $35,000, which is
overdue, with interest from May 15, 1877; and that the parties who claim to be secured by the assignment of November
15, 1876, a copy of which is annexed to the bill, are very
numerous and cannot without inconvenience and delay be
brought before the court. It then sets forth the filing of the
former bill by Pepper; the contents of the decree of May 12,
1879; the appeal by Shepherd from that decree; the sale of
the property to Pepper by Philip and Johnston, trustees;
the filing of the bill by Shepherd, the proceedings thereunder,
and the entry of the decree of October 30, 1880; the filing of
the opinion of Mr. Justice James; and the order striking that
opinion from the files.
The bill further alleges, that it is competent to show at any
time the grounds upon which the decree of October 30, 1889,
was placed by the opinion of the court; that, as that opinion
states that the decree of May 12, 1879, did not give to Johnston
any power to sell, the decree of October 30, 1880, was in effect
an adjudication upon, and favorable to, the averments in the bill
filed by Shepherd; that the sale to Pepper was made without
authority, and that the deed of Philip and Johnston to Pepper
was null and void; that, as Shepherd had always insisted that

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

the decreeof May 12, 1879, was void and the sale to Pepper a
nullity, and to the end that said lot 3 may be sold as a whole,
Pepper files his bill in order that an undisputed title to the
whole property may be obtained by means of foreclosure
proceedings under the decree of the court; that the lot numbered 3 in Shepherd's subdivision of square 164, fronting 43
feet 9 inches on K Street and 109 feet inch on Connecticut
Avenue, being the property described in the deed of trust in
favor of Mrs. Gray, is improved by an expensive dwellinghouse, erected thereon by Shepherd; that the portion of that
lot 3 contained in the descriptive clauses of the two deeds of
trust given by Shepherd to secure the moneys loaned to him
by Pepper, does not embrace all the ground covered by and
appurtenant to the dwelling-house, the portion omitted from
those two deeds of trust being a lot designated as sub-lot A,
fronting about 28 feet 2- inches on Connecticut Avenue, and
running back with that width; that the omission of that
strip from those two deeds of trust was either by accident or
fraud on the, part of Shepherd or his agents; that in either
cgse Pepper is entitled to have the description of the ground
in' those deeds corrected, so as to include that strip; that by
the agreement of Pepper with Shepherd it was provided that
Shepherd should grant to trustees, to secure Pepper, all of the
real estate covered by his residence on the corner of K Street
and Connecticut Avenue, and all the property to be used as
appurtenant and connected therewith, and which is designated
on the plat books of the city as lot 3 of Shepherd's subdivision
of'square 164; that, relying upon the fact that the first deed
of trust embraced all the property now described as lot 3 in
square' f64, Pepper agreed to make a second loan on the same
property, and therefore the second deed of trust was executed
as now found; that, relying upon the belief that both of the
deeds of trust embraced all of the real estate used or to be used
by Shepherd for his residence and appurtenant thereto, Pepper
advanced th $45,000, and relied upon the deeds as his security
'fo the loan, believing that-they conformed to his contracts
with Shepherd and embraced all the real estate owned at that
point by Shepherd and all the land covered by the house and.

appurtenant thereto;, that he would not have' loaned any
money to Shepherd if he had known that the deeds of trust did
not eml)race all of such real estate and the improvement mhade
or to be made at that- point by Shepherd, with the yard now
belonging thereto; that, after the execution of the deeds and
the advance of the $45,000, Pepper discovered that sub-lot -A,
constituting the rear 28 feet '14 inches of lot 3 in square 164,
was omitted entirely from the deeds; thereby cutting off a portion of the improvements and seriously impairing the security;
that the omissions were made by the fraud of. Shepherd or his,
agents, and without any-suspicion of' the omission on the part
of Pepper; that Shepherd states that he fully intended to embrace in the two deeds all' the ' said real estate, and executed the
deeds with the belief that all of said property was so inbluded,
.but that the omission-to include all of it was due to accident
or mistake on the part of himself or of his agents who prepared
the. deeds, and without fraud on his or their 'part ; that it was
well understood by Mrs. Gray, when and before she loaned the
$35,000 to Shepherd, that the two prior deeds of trust in favor
of Pepper constituted prior liens on all the real estate embraced'
in the deed of trust Lo secure her, that is,. lot 3 in square 164;
that she made her loanwith the belief on her part' that both
of the prior deeds of trust actually embraced all of the said
real estate, and with the belief that Pepper and, Shepherd
understood that all of said real.estate wasso'embraced; that
she had. actual notice that Pepper and Shepherd fullyintended
to embrace in the first and second deeds of trust all the real
estate embracedin the third one ;that the lien of Pepperunder,
his two deeds of trust is paramount to that of Mrs. Gray, as to
all of the real estate referred to in her deed of trust, and ought,
to be enforced, either by reforming the first' two deeds by I
including therein all of.the real'estate embraced in the'deed in
favor of Mrs.7Gray, or by enforcing the lien of Pepper on lot
3 as airequitable mortgage prior to any rights of Mrs. Gray
therein; that after Pepper had so advanced to Shepherd the
$45,000, he.learned for the first time that Shepherd, when he
exeduted the first two deeds, had only a'tax title to sub-lo't Aj"
in square 164:; that Shepherd had, since-said, loans were male

to him, -perfected his title to sub-lot A, by buying in all adverse claims, and had paid the money therefor from his own
means; that such sub-lot A was conveyed either to Shepherd
or to some friend as trustee for him; and that in either case
the perfected title will enure to the benefit of Pepper and of
Mrs. Gray.
The bill further alleges that the said principal sums, with
large arrears of interest, are due to Pepper and to Mrs. Gray,
respectively, and sums are also due to Pepper for premiums
of insurance and taxes paid by him; that Shepherd had been
riceiving $6000 per annum as rent for the premises and the
furniture in the house; that the incumbrances on the real
estate in favor of Pepper and Mrs. Gray, with the arrears of
taxes, amount to about $120,000, and are increasing at the
rate of about $9000 a year; that the real estate is an inadequate security for the sums charged upon it, and cannot be sold
for a sum sufficient to meet even the existing liens on it, and
will not yield from rents an adequate income on the sum
charged upon it ; that Shepherd is insolvent, and there are
unsatisfied judgments of record against him in the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia, besides unsecured debts
estimated by Shepherd to amount to $310,000; that Shepherd
is unwilling and unable to make good the deficiency due to
Pepper, after properly applying the net proceeds of the sale
of the property; and that Bradley refused to sell the property
vested in him as trustee under the first deed of trust, and has
endeavored to delay and prevent its sale.
The prayer of the bill is for the appointment of a receiver
to receive the rents due and to become due for lot 3 jand the
improvements upon it; for the appointment of a trustee or
trustees.to sell the whole of such lot and improvements; that
the rents and the proceeds of the sale of lot 3 be applied first
to pay said indebtedness to Pepper, with all interest, costs,
charges and expenses due to him by reason of the premises;
that Shepherd may discover the name of the holder of the
legal title to said sub-lot A, and be restrained from receiving
or-disposing of any part of the rent paid or to become due for
lot 3 an the improvements thereon; and for general relief.

SHEPHERD v. PEPPER:
Opinion of the Court.

A restraining order against Shepherd, as prayed for, was
issued on the filing of the bill.
Bradley answered the bill, and took the ground that in the
first bill filed by Pepper the latter had insisted upon his right
to the sale of the property as described in the two deeds of
trust made in his favor, and did not ask to have the defective
description corrected, and had procured the property to be
sold, and had purchased it .and received a deed for it, and
claimed title to it, by the description contained in those two
deeds-of trust. Bradley's answer also set up that Pepper had
brought a suit at law, on the 20th of April, 1880, against
Shepherd to recover on the several promissory notes mentioned
in the first two deeds of trust.
The bill was taken as confessed by Fitch, -Mattingly, Alexander and Barker.
Mrs. 'Gray answered the bill, alleging that at the time .the
deed of' trust in her favor was made she was informed and believed that the two prior deeds of trust covered only the property described in them, and that the deed of trust given to
- secure her was a second lien oik the part of lot 3 described in
those deeds of trust, and the first lien on the remaining part
of that lot; that, relying on. that information, which was true,
she loaned to Shepherd the $35,000 on the security of that lot;
that she had no knowledge or.information that Pepper claimed
that there was any accident, mistake, or fraud in connection
with the first two deeds of trust, or that they should have
covered any property beyond what they actually covered ;
and that Pepper has no right to have the first two deeds of
trust amended, extended, or changed, as against her, or, any
right .to any lien on any part of lot 3, as against her, except
that part described in the first two deeds of trust. She'object§
to a' sale of lot 3.
Cross and Bacon put in an answer to the bill; and the courti
on the 1st of December, 1881, on a hearing, granted an injunction as prayed, against all of the defendants except Alexander
and Barker, and appointed a receiver of the rents accrued and
to become due. The order states that each of the defendants
enjoined appealed from it. Johnston afterwards withdrew -his

appeal; and on the motion of Pepper the appeal- of the other
defendanus was dismissed, by the general term..
Shepherd put in an answer to the bill, on -the 1st of June,
1882, denying that the bill filed by him was dismissed for want
of jurisdiction; denying that the omission of sub-lot A from
the first two deeds of trust was an accident or a fraud on his
part or on that, of his agents; and denying that Pepper has
the right to have the deeds corrected so as ;to include sub-lot
A; but admitting that he (Shepherd) executed the first two
deeds of trust in the belief that the whole property covered
by the h6use was embraced in them. The answer sets up that
Pepper has no right to the rents of the house or to the rent of
the furniture contained in it, and no interest in the premises
except to have them sold and his claims paid out of the proceeds of sale; that the subject matter of the bill is embraced
in the prior suit brought by Pepper, which is still pending;
and that, if Pepper has any right to relief, he must seek it in
that suit by bill of review or otherwise.
On the 21st of July, 1882, Pepper amended his bill by averring that lot 3 was wholly insufficient security for the debt admitted by Shepherd to be due to Pepper and charged thereon,
and could not be sold for a sum sufficient to meet the debt so
admitted, and would not yield in rents an adequate income on
the value of the same, even assuming such value to be equal to
the amount of the debt admitted to be due to Pepper and
charged on the lot. The amendment also stated that Philip
died intestate, leaving surviving him a widow and four children, infants, whose names were given, and added the names
of such children as defendants. It also stated that Pepper was
willing 'to surrender, and did thereby surrender, for the purpose
of a resale of the said real estate, any title in fee simple wbich
he might have thereto by reason of the deed to him from 'Philip
and Johnston, trustees; and that, for the purpose of reselling
such real estate, he waived any interest, claim, or title vested
in him by that deed, and offered to make any conveyance
which the court might deem proper or necessary to accomplish
the purpose indicated.
The bill and amendments were answered by Davis, Fitch

Opinion of the- Court.

and Barker, and the amendments were answered by Cross,
Bacon, Bradley. and Mrs. Gray. The answer of Mrs. Gray
alleged that it was not in the power of Pepper to make or
carry out the offer contained in the amendments; that, if any
title passed to..him by the sale and the deed to him by Philip
and Johnston, he had no right to bring this suit; and that if,
on the contrary, no title .passed'to himi -bythe sale, !the offer
contained in the amendments was a vain and useless, form.
Shepherd also answered the amendments, alleging that the
proposed offer by'Pepper was n6 actual surrender of any interest or waiver of any right.
The orderpro confesso as to Mattingly having been vacated,he put in a plea, setting up the sale and the. deed td Pepper,
the filing of the bill by Shepherd and of the cross-bill by
Pepper, and the decree of, October 30,.1880, and averring that
Pepper, ever since the deed to him, had claimed to be the
owner of the property in fee simple, and-still so claimed.
The bill was taken as confessed against the wife of Shep.
herd; a guardian ad litenm was appointed for the infant children of Philip, who put in an answer to the bill; Johnston
and Bartlett also answered it and the amendments; issue was
joined as to all the defendants who had answered ; and the
plea of Mattingly was ordered'to stand as his answer.
Proofs were tAken on both sides, the cause- was heard by
the court in special term, and afterwards, on the 24th of
March, 18S5, Shepherd presented to the court two petitions,
wherein he set forth the bringing of a suit at law against him
by Pepper, on the 20th of May, 1882, upon the promissory
notes; that at the hearing he learned for the first 'time that
Pepper claimed 'a personal, decree against him, under the
prayer in the bill for general relief; that, when the, claim to
such personal decree was made, at the hearing, his personal
liability upon the notes was barred by the -statute of limitations, because the-notes were all of them then' more than three
years overdue; and, that he ought to be allowed to interp*se
that objection to a personal decree. He therefore prayed for
a hearing on the subject of the right of Pepper to a personial
decree against him, and to be allowed to take proof as. tio'the

fact of the pendency of the action at law; that the plaintiff
might be required to elect between the pending action at law
and his claim for a personal decree for a deficiency; that, if
he elected to claim such personal decree, he might be required
by amendment to make his bill a bill for that purpose, and
Shepherd be allowed to answer or plead to it; that Shepherd
be allowed a rehearing on the questions as to the disposition
of the funds in the hands of the receiver, and as to interest
upon the coupon notes; and that he be allowed to interpose
by plea or answer the defence of the statute of limitations to
a-claim for a personal decree. These petitions were dismissed
by the court.
On the 26th of March, 1885, the court in special term made
a decree; that unless Shepherd should pay to Pepper, on or
before the 1st of July, 1885, $35,000, with interest thereon at
the rate of nine per-cent per annum from the 1st day of June,
1879, until paid, and the further sum of $9450, being the
amount of six coupon notes, all dated June 1, 1874, signed by
Shepherd, and representing six semi-annual instalments of
interest due by him on the principal sum of $35,000, with interest upon them at the rate of six per cent per annum until
paid, namely;upon six sums of $1575 each, one from December
1, 1876, one from June 1, 1877, one from December 1, 1877,

of it as directed the sale of sub-lot A; and Pepper also appealed from it.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889
Opinion of the Court.

The court in general term, on the 29th of October, 1885,
affirmed the decree of the special term of March 26, 1885,
with these modifications: It directed that the inquiry as to
the relative values of the two parcels of property should take
place after the sale had- been made; that, if the debt due to
Mrs. Gray should be satisfied otherwise than by applying
thereto her proper share of the proceeds of the sale, the entire
proceeds of the sale of lot 3 should be applied to the payment
of Pepper's debt and interest, or if the proportion' of such proceeds set apart by the decree to satisfy Mrsi. Gray's debt
should more than suffice to satisfy it, then any surplus of such
proceeds should be paid over to Pepper on account of his debt
and interest; and that the balance of rents remaining in the
receiver's hands, after deducting the payments to be made out
of such rents as specified in the decree, and after paying interest to Pepper on the sums advanced by him for ta.es and
insurance premiums, should be paid by the receiver to Pepper
on account of any balance of principal and interest, as decreed,
that-should remain due after applying the proceeds of lot 3, as
directed by the decree to be apportioned and applied. It also
affirmed the orders dismissing the two petitions filed by Shepherd on the 24th of March, 1885, and charged Shepherd with
the costs of the appeal.
Shepherd, Cross, Bacon, Bartlett and Mrs. Gray appealed
in open court to this court from the decree of October 29,
1885, the appeal was allowed, and the amount of the supersedeas bond on behalf of the defendants other than Mrs. Gray
was fixed at $1000, and that on her behalf at $100. The appeal of Pepper Was abandoned. The defendants other than
Mrs. Gray gave the bond required of them. M rs. Gray did
not give the necessary bond; and, although the record was
filed in this court on the 9th of October, 1886, she took no
action to perfect her appeal to this court until the case came on
for hearing, on the 26th of November, 1889, when she offered
to the court to be filed a proper bond in the sum of $100. No
citation was necessary oti her appeal, as she had taken-it in open
cou, the reo~rd had been duly filed in this court, on October
9, 1886, and, under the circumstances, we will permit the bond

SHEPHERD v. PEPPER.
Opinion of the Court.

on behalf of Mrs. Gray to be filed'nunc _pro tunc as of the
26th of November, 1889,_ and her appeal to stand as perfected.
At the time the loans wiere made by Pepper to Shepherd,
Shepherd claimed to own and agreed to give as security therefor, the land and imp~rovenlents situated at the .nortbeast corner of Connecticut Avenue and K Street, fronting 43 feet 9
inches on K Street, and 109 feet ' inch on Connecticut, Avenue,
containing 8466.22 square feet, known as lot No. 3 in Shepherd's subdivision of lots in square No. 16L. The improvements covered nearly the whole of that lot, the portion not so
covered being enclosed and used in connection with the house.
It was the intention of both Pepper and Shepherd that the
whole of this property should be included in the deeds of
trust; and if Pepper had any knowledge, information or suspicion- to the contrary, he would not have loaned any of the,
money. Shepherd testifies that when, he executed the deeds
of trutt, he supposed that they embraced the whole property.
On the piece of land known as sub-lot A; being that, part of
lot 3 which fronts 28. feet 21 inches on Connecticut Avenue,
and has such a depth that it contains 3656 square feet, there
had been actually constructed at. the time a :pgrtion of the
dwelling-house, which includes the: coal-vaults, the laundry,
the servants' apartments, and a .portion of the picture gallery.
It is not' denied by Shepherd that the debts due byJhim to
Pepper are bona jFde debts, and are overdue; and their ekis_ence and amounts are satisfactorily proved. The sole defence
of Shepherd amounts to this, that by the uncertainty and delay
of the law, and by mistakes in the legal proceedings, Pepper
has lost all right to the execution of the trusts created for his
benefit;, aid it is urged that, by reason of the proceedinga in
the-prior suit brought by Pepper, he is estopped from maintaining the present bill.
The opinion of the court in general term, delivered by Mr.
Justice Merrick, is reported in 4 Mackey, 269. It states that
when the decree of May 12, 1879, in the suit brought by Pepper,,
came to be made, "there was by inadvertence an errorin the
description of the-property in the decree, by leaving a blank
in the designation of the trust deed,, the Tesult of which was

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

that the decree was uncertain in itself and practically void on
account of the uncertainty in its description of the property
As Bradley was trustee in each of the first two deeds of trust,
and as the decree appointed Johnston to be trustee in the place
and stead of Bradley in but one deed of trust, which was so
described that it could not be identified, the whole transaction
became uncertain and void. It resulted from this, as the
opinion states, that there was no effective appointment of a
trustee, and no effective sale; and the bill in the suit brought
by Shepherd was dismissed on the ground that there was no
cloud upon the title, because the sale itself was a nullity. The
opinion further states that, while Shepherd averred in his
answer that the sale to Pepper was a nullity and passed no
title, and Mrs. Gray by her answer averred the samb thing,
they were now taking the ground that Pepper had no right to
have a second sale of the property, because, having bought
under the first sale, he must abide thereby; in other words,
that, although he acquired no title under the first sale, he is
estopped by that sale, from having it sold again. The opinion
adds, that this is a defence which a court of equity cannot
entertain. It also considers the point taken by Mrs. Gray,
,that, inasmuch as she is the first encumbrancer on sub-lot A,
Pepper cannot have the whole property sold without first discharging her entire claim, and says that the two pieces of
property had been held in a general ownership; that the testimony showed that to sever them would be destructive of the
value of both; that although Pepper had not brought hom6 to
the knowledge of Mrs. Gray the equitable mortgage as between him and Shepherd, yet the fact of the building being
upon the two lots, and the further fact that, if there is to be a
sale, the whole property ought to be sold together, because the
value of both would be decreased if they were sold separately,
constituted a case where a court of equity ought to order all
the property to be sold together; that it would be inequitable
to compel Pepper to redeem the whole of the debt to Mrs.
Gray as a condition of the sale of sub-lot A, because Mrs: Gray
is entitled to o.nly an inconsiderable portion of the encumbered
premises, except in subordination to the claims under the first

SHEPHERD v.

PEPPER.'

Opinion of the Court.

two trust deeds; and that the decree 'of the special term, in
giving to Mrs. Gray such portion of the proceeds of sale as
should be determined to be the value of her interest in sub-lot
A, upon testimony as to the relative values .of the two properties, gave to her all that she was entitled to in equity. A's to
the rents and profits, the opinion said that wherever property
subject to a lien has been brought within the domain of a
court of equity, and a receiver of it is appointed, the rents and
profits in the hands of the receiver will be applied, along with
the corpus of the fund, to satisfy the lien,. after paying charges,
such as taxes and insurance; that the special term properly
directed the application of the rents to pay off premiums of
insurance and taxes which had accrued; but that the decree
ought to be modified by directing that the residue of the rents
should go to make up any deficiency in the proceeds of the
sale of the two properties to satisfy the corpus of the debts,
recognizing the right of Mrs. Gray to her share of the proceeds.
of "ale according to the apportionment before indicated, but
dedicating the rents primarily to the satisfaction of the debts
due to Pepper, together with the proceeds of the sale of the
primary property upon which the house is built. We concur
in these views of the general term.
The bill in the first suit brought by Pepper was a bill
merely to substitute a trustee in the place of the trustees in
the first two deeds of trust. The prayer of the bill was that
such trustee be appointed, with directions and authority forthwith to execute all *thetrusts rpposed by the first two deeds.of
trust in the trustees mentioned therein. It does not pray that
an officer of the court shall make the sale, or that the trustee
to be appointed by the court shall make the sale under any
powier to be given to him by the court; but it prays that he
may execute the trusts under the deeds of trust. . Moreover,
the decree of May 12, 1879, declares that it is made "without
prejudice to all-other rightq.of defendant." -, This reserved the
right of Shepherd to be heard on -thequestion of the right of
Pepper' to foreclose under the deeds of trust. The present
suit is a suit for foreclosure, and in it all defences to the claims
.of Pepper were open to be made by Shepherd. In respect of

BER TERM," 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

parties, in respect of subject matter and in respect of the relief
prayed for, the two bills brought by Pepper are different; and
none of the questions involved in the pleadings in the present
suit were involved in or adjudicated in the first suit brought
by Pepper. Still further, the uncertainty and inoperative
character of the decree of May 12, 1879, make the whole suit
'fruitless and of no-more effect -than if it had never been cornmenced.
For the same reason, Pepper cannot be regarded as having
made any election, in the first suit brought by him, to enforce
a sale of the property described in the first two deeds of trust
aside from a sale with it of sub-lot A, so as to be estopped
from now asserting a lien upon sub-lot A. When the first bill
was filed by Pepper, he knew that Shepherd had merely a tax
title to sub-lot A; and Shepherd, in his answer to that bill,
averred that the title to sub-lot A never belonged to him, and
that he theretofore purchased what is called a tax title to sublot A, but it turned out to be void and of no effect. Therefore,
Pepper could not at that time have attempted to reform the
first 'two deeds of trust -so as to include sub-lot A, because
Shepherd then had no title to that sub-lot. But the fact that
both Pepper and Shepherd agree that it was intended by them
that the fist two deeds of trust should include sub-lot A, gave
Pepper a right to assert an equitable mortgage against that
sub-lot; so that afterwards, when Shepherd bought in the
proprietary title to it, as the evidence shows he did, Pepper
was for the first time in a position to assert a lien against it.
It is, we think, very plain that Pepper acquired no title by
the deed to him under the sale by the trustees, and that the
decree dismissing the bill filed by Shepherd had no effect to
establish iny legal title in Pepper to the real estate in question. -Even'if resort may not be had to the opinion of Mr.
"Justice James, still it is manifest that the propositions stated
in that opinion are sound, namely, that -ifthe decree of May
.12,1879, was uncertain on its face, in the respects and to the
.extent before mentioned, the alleged title of Pepper, through
the deed from the trustees to him, was not a cloud upon the
title of Shepherd, and therefore the court could not grant

Sl[EPBERD v. PEPPER.'

•649

Opini6n of the Court.

Shepherd the relief he prayed for in the bill filed ly him, and
that bill was properly dismissed.
This view of the case is taken by Pep-per, in his bill in the
present suit, because he says therein, in regard to the decree of
May 12, 1879, and the opinion of Mr. Justice James, "that,.
as. it appears by the said opinion of the court that the said
decree did not give to the said Johnston any power to sell, said
decree was in effect, an adjudication upon and favorable to
-the averments in said Shepherd's bill of complaint iii said court
that said sale was made withsut authority and the deed of
said Philip.and Johnston was null and void, and, as the said
Shepherd has always averred and insisted that said decree
was void and said sale a nullity, and to the end that said lot 3
of said Shepherd's subdivision may be sold as a whole, the,
complainant files this bill in order that an undisputed title to.
the whole property may be -obtained by means of foreclosurq
proceedings under the order and decree of this court.' 'Then
the bill prays accordingly, "that a trustee or trustees may be
appointed by this court to sell the whole-of lot-3, in A. R.
Shepherd's subdivision of square numbered 164, -with the improvements thereon." Therefore, it- is not true that Pepper'
is still asserting a legal title in himself.
We think that Pepper is entitled to.have the whole of lot 3
sold. It was omitted at least by accident from the first two
trust deeds, when both parties supposed -they'covered it. Lot
3 embraces not only sub-lot A, but the pr6perty co' ered by
the first two deeds of trust. Shepherd, in his answer to the
first bill filed by Pepper, said, "that, in his bpinion, it *ould
be impossibFe to make a sale and division of the said'-property,
under the said deed of trust without irrelarable ijury-tq; if
not total destruction of, a large portion of the dwelling-house
' that the said
which is 'erected upon the said lot;
dwelling-house would be entirely incomplete without the addition of that' portion called the ' picture-gallery;' that the servaUts' apartments and the laundry and drying-room, etc., etc.,
are underneath the said portion of said dwelling-house. as well
as the heating -apparatus fot. a' largb portion'of the house; and
that, if the said lot A, which is not included in the deed of

OCTOBER. TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

trust of the said complainant, shall be- separated from that
portion which is included in the said deed of trust to the complainant, a dividing line would not only take off the said 'picture-gallery,' but would take off and destroy a portion of the
back part of the main dwelling-house."
In regard to Mrs. Gray, the letter to her, written by Mr.
Brown, of the firm of Fitch, Fox & Brown, who were negotiating for her the loan to Shepherd, the letter being dated
April 18, 1876, speaks of the loan as one "to be secured by a
second mortgage,-the prior mortgage being for $45,000." Bosides this, the first two deeds of trust were recorded respectively June 3, 1874, and March 24, 1875, and they conveyed,
to secure Pepper, the premises described in them, "together
with all the -improvements, ways, easements, rights, privileges,
and appurtenances to the same belonging or in anywise appertaining, and all the estate, right, title, interest and claim,
whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, of the said parties of
the first part, of, in, to, or out 3f the said piece or parcel of
land and premises." -The improvements and easements in
questi6n were visibly necessary for the dwelling-house as then
-constructed, and were visibly upon, or required the use of, sublof A, as stated by Shepherd, as before recited.
Mrs. Gray is only a mortgagee, and not the owner in fee, of
sub-lot A; and h6r interest in the property is subject to the
-prior and subsequent interests of other parties, as those interests 'are usually ascertained and administered by a court.of
eqiuity for the benefit of all concerned. It is not equitable
that .she should be allowed to use her mortgage on sub-lot A"
to prevent a sale of the entire lot 3. Her only right can be to
-shave the proceeds of sub-lot A applied first to the payment of
.her debt; and that right is secured -by the decree appealed
f.rom.
-The present bill is one to obtain a decree for the sale of
5ncnmbered premises and the application of the proceeds of*

debts to :Pepper and to Mrs. Gray. are overdue; and under
such circumstances a court of equity, on the application of a

decreed, on the small remaining portion; and the debts secured
by the first-two deeds of trust -were all overdue when the bill
in this case Was filed, as well as the debt due to Mrs. Gray.
Under such circumstances, the mere non-assent of Mrs. .Gray
ought not to prevent the court from doing what is equitablein regard to the claims of Pepper, as well as those of herself.
There was no. error in the dismissal of the two petitioiis of
Shepherd, filed in March, 1885, *nor in entering a personal
decree against him for any deficiency- which should remain
after exhausting the' property covered by the deeds of trust.
The fact of the bringing of the suit .at law upon the notes,
-by Pepper against Sliepherd, in April, 1$80, was set up in the
,answer of Bradley to the bill in the present suit, and was
therefore in issue; but it was not shown in defence that
Shepherd had ever been served-with process in any such suit
at.law, or had appeared.in it, voluntarily or otherwise. :Moreover, the principal notes given to Pepper were not barred by
limitatio-h when the bill in this case was filed. As to 'the
interest notes or coupons, although some of the unpaid ones
for each of such two principal notes had been overdue more
than three years when the bill was filed, yet it niakes' a claim
to recover, all the interest, and Shepherd does not, in his
answer, set up the statute of limitation as a bar to any part
of the principal or interest claimed.

for a deficiency is a necessary incident of a foreclosure suit in
equity. It is provided as follows by section 808 of the
Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia: "The
proceeding to enforce any lien shall be by bill or petition
in equity, and the. decree, besides subjecting the thing upon
which the lien has attached to the satisfaction of the plaintiff's demand against the defendant, shall adjudge that the plaintiff recover his demand against the defendant, and that he

interpreted by this court In the case of -Dodge v. Freedman's
Savings and Trust Co., 106 U. S. 415, where it was held that
it authorized a decree in personamn against the debtor for the
balance'remaining due after the proceeds of the sale of lands
covered by a mortgage or a deed of trust in the nature thereof
had been applied to the satisfaction of the debt. The present
cause is of the same character of foreclosure proceeding as that
involved in the case cited. It was proper for the court, under
the bill as it stands and the statute on the subject, to make a
personal decree against Shepherd for a deficiency; and the
matter of granting the prayers of his petitions filed in March,
1885, was a question of discretion in the court below, and not
reviewable.
As to the question of the disposition of the rents in the
hands of the receiver we think the action of the court below
was proper. The pecuniary condition of Shepherd, his failure
to pay taxes, premiums of insurance, or interest, the inadequacy of the property to pay the claims of Pepper and Mrs.
Gray, and the diversion of the income from rents, from making such payments, to the use of Shepherd, up to the time of
the appointment of the receiver, were adequate grounds for
the appointment of the receiver. KYountze v. Omaha. Hotel
Co., 107 U. S. 378, 395 ; Grant v. Insurance Co., 121 U. S.
105. The court, through its receiver, took possession of the
rents in order to preserve them for that party to the suit who
should! ultimately be found to be equitably entitled to them.

building, show the necessity of his appointment. It would
be grossly unjust, on the facts developed in this case, to appropriate the rents in the hands of the receiver to the use of
Shepherd.
It is contended on behalf of Shepherd that the decree appealed from is erroneous, because it allows interest at the rate
of nine per centum per annuinon the principal of the notes, from
June 1, 1879, and March 22, 1880, respectively, until paid; and
it is urged- that the interest should have been fixed at the rate
of six per cent, from the date of the decree, March 26, 1885,
on the ground that that was the rate of interest fixed by the
statute on judgments and decrees.
Section 713 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District
of Columbia provides as follows: "The rate, of interest upon
judgments or decrees, and upon the loan- or forbearance of any
money, goods or things in actions, shall continue to be six
dollars upon one hundred dollars for one year, and after that
rate for a greater or less sum, or for a longer or shorter time,
except as provided in this. chapter." Section 829 of said
Revised Statutes provides as follows: "Upon all judgments
rendered .on the common law side of the court in actions
founded on contracts, interest at the rate of six per cen.tum
per annum shall be awarded on the principal sum due until
the judgment shall be satisfied, and the amount which, is to
bear interest and the time from which it is to be paid shall.be
ascertained by the verdict of the jury sworn in the cause."
Section 714 authorizes parties to contract in writing for the
payment of interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum.
It is urged that the decree is a decree which fixes the
amount of each of the debts due by Shepherd, and says that
those sums are "hereby decreed to be due and payable" by
Shepherd, to Pepper, with interest, etc. ; that this is the
language of a judgment ; and that almost the same language
is employed in reference to the accrued interest. The decree
provides that, if the net proceeds of the sale shall prove insufficient to discharge the claims of Pepper, he shall have and
recover of Shepherd whatever amount may remain due of the
.caims decreed to be due by Shepherd to him, after the ap

'plication thereto of the net proceeds of sale, and sh'll-have
execution therefor as at law. It'is contended, therefore, that,
-as the decree ascertained the amount of the debt still due, and
fixed the rate of interest on it, it thereafter drew interest by
virtue of the decree, and not by irtue of the terms, of the
contract, because the contract was merged in the decree.
We think, however, that on the face of the decree the cou't
did not intend to, and did not, merge the contract in the decree;
-but merely fixed the amount due according to the terms of
the contract on the. payment of which, before the day fixed,
the decree would not go into effect, but the case would be
dismissed. The statute has, no applicatiQn, except as to the
rate of interest charged on the deficiency which shall befound
to exist after applying the net proceeds of sale to the debt, and
the decree does not provide for interest in excess of six- per
cent per annum on such deficiency.
In regard to allowing interest on the principal of the notes
at the rate of nine per cent per annum until paid, it is to be said
that'such was the contract in each note.
It was stated at the bar that Hanna, one of the trustees appointed by the decree of the special term to mhake the sale,
had died- If so, the court-below will have power to appoint a
new one in his place.
The decree in general term is, therefore,

JusTnCE

MILLEn, dissenting.:

I dissent from so much of the judgment of the court in this
case as requires the entire property to be sold together and
-make provision afterwards for dividing the proceeds according,
.to the valuation that may be made to ascertain how much df
the money should go to appellant, Maria Gray.
I am of opinion that she'has a right to have the ,piece of
.ground, on which her inortgage is declared to be the first lien,'
gold separately, so that she can bid whatever sum she may see
proper in satisfaction of her mo4gage. If this sum should be
more than would satisfy the mortgage, of course the excess
would go to the satisfaction of ?epper's debt. If it should
