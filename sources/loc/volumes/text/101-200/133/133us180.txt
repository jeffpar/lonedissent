APPEAL
No. 855.

X3O1 THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

Submitted January 10,1890.-Decided January 27,1890.

An envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States
to Turkey was never appointed before July 13, 1882. On that day, the
claimant, being minister resident and consul general of the United States
to Turkey, at a salary of $7500 a year, was appointed to the higher grade.
By each of the diplomatic appropriation bills of 1882, 1883 and 1884,
$7500 was appropriated for the salary of an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Turkey. The claimant, having been paid the
$7500 salary for each of those years, sued in the Court of Claims to re,cover the difference between that amount and an annual salary of $10,000,
claiming the latter under ยง 1675 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by
the act of March 3, 1875, c. 153, 18 Stat. 483 Held, that as, under the
amendment of 1875, the salary was to be $10,000, " unless where a different compensation is prescribed by law," and the office did not exist before July 1, 1882. and the first provision made by Congress for a salary
for it was made by the act of July 1, 1882, and was for .$7500, and the
same provision was continued while the claimant thereafter held the
office, and he was paid the $7500, he had no further claim.

"'United -States Government in acc't with Lew Wallace,

"'To ain't of my salary from July 1st, 1882, to 30th September 1882, -months, at the rate of $7500 per annum.'

"5. The compensation paid to the claimant, from the time of

per annum, and claimant's account stands closed upon the
books of the Treasury by payment in full.
"6. Claimant was minister resident and consul general of
the United States to Turkey at the date of his appointment
as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary"
On the foregoing findings, the court deciaed, as matter of
law, that the petition should be dismissed, under the decision
of that court in the case of Francms v Untted States, 22 C. Cl.
403.
On the 13th of July, 1882, when the claimant entered upon
his duties as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
of the Umted States to Turkey, section 1675 of the Revised
Statutes, as amended by the act of March 3, 1875, c. 153, 18
Stat. 483, was in force, reading as follows
"S1Ec. 1675. Ambassadors and envoys extraordinary and
ministers plenipotentiary shall be entitled to compensation at
the rates following, per annum, namely
"Those to France, Germany, Great Britain and Russia, each,
seventeen.thousand five hundred dollars.

WALLACE v. UTNITED STATES.
Opimon of the Court.

"Those to Austria, Brazil, China, Italy, Japan, Mexico and
Spain, each, twelve thousand dollars.
"Those to all other countries, unless where a different compensation is prescribed by law, each, ten thousand dollars.
"And unless when otherwise provided by lam, ministers
resident and commissioners shall be entitled to compensation
at the rate of seventy-five per centum, charges d'affaires at
the rate of fifty per centum and secretaries of legation at the
rate fifteen per centum, of the amounts allowed to ambassadors, envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary to
the said countries respectively, except that the secretary of
legationfi to Japan shall be entitled to compensation at the rate
of twenty-five hundred dollars per annum.
"The second secretaries of the legations to France, Germany
and Great Britain shall be entitled to compensation at the
rate of two thousand dollars each per annum."
Under the provision of that section, an envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary to Turkey would be entitled to
an annual compensation of $10,000, unless a different compensation was prescribed by law Having received compensation at the rate of $7500 per annum, the claimant brought
suit for the difference between that sum and $10,000 per
annum, for the time from July 13, 1882, to June 30, 1885.
The office of envoy extraordinary and minister plempotentiary to Turkey did not exist prior to July 1, 1882. Before
that time, the diplomatic representative of the United States
to Turkey was of the rank of a minister resident and consul
general, and the claimant held that office, at an annual salary
of $7500, when he was appointed envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary
By the act of July 1, 1882, c. 262, 22 Stat. 128, entitled
"An act making appropriations for the consular and diplomatic service of the government for the fiscal year ending
June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty three, and for
other purposes," it was provided "that the following sums, be,
and they are hereby, appropriated for the service of the fiscal
year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-three,
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated,
for the objects hereinafter expressed, namely

By the act of February 26, 1883, c. 36, 22 Stat. 424, entitled
"An act making appropriations for the consular and diplomatic service of the government for the fiscal year ending
June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-four, and for other
purposes," it was provided "that the following sums be, and
they are hereby, appropriated for the service of the fiscal year
ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-four, out
of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for
the ob.iects herein expressed, namely
"For salaries of envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, as follows: To Chili and Peru, at ten thousand
dollars each, to Turkey, seven thousand five hundred dollars,
in all, twenty-seven thousand five hundred dollars."
By the act of July 7, 1884, c. 333, 23 Stat. 227, entitled "An
act making appropriations for the consular and diplomatic
service of the government for the fiscal year ending June

not otherwise appropriated, for the objects hereinafter expressed, namely
"For salaries of envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary to the United States of Colombia and Turkey, at
seven thousand five hundred dollars each, fifteen thousand
dollars."
No attempt was made by Congress, by those three statutes
or by any other statute, to create the office of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Turkey, but, as Congress
had, by the act of July 1, 1882, made an appropriation of
$75OQto pay the salary of an envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary to Turkey, at the sum of $7500 for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1883, and had thus left it to the Presider

WALLACE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

to fill such office, if he chose to do so, under his constitutional
power, the President exercised that power by appointing the
claimant, on the 13th of July, 1882.
By such provision of the act of July 1, 1882, continued by
the acts of February 26, 1883, and July 7, 1884, a different
compensation per annum from that of $10,000 was prescribed
by law for the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Turkey, within the meaning of section 1675 of the
Revised Statutes, before quoted. In view of the fact that the
office of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to
Turkey. never had existed and never had been filled by any
person prior to July 1, 1882, and of the fact that the first
provision made by Congress for that office, in regard to its
compensation, was for an annual salary of $7500, that sum
must be considered as then having been prescribed by Congress
as the compensation for the officer who might be appointed to
fill it. It was, therefore, the compensation prescribed by law
as the annual compensation for that officer, and was a different
compensation from that prescribed by section 1675 of the
.. evised Statutes, and, according to that section, the compensation could not be $10,000 a year.
The President raised the grade of the legation at Constantinople to a plenipotentiary mission by his appointment of the
claimant as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
to Turkey, on the 13th of July, 1882, and Congress provided
for the office an annual salary of $7500. The claimant could
have no larger salary, and can recover nothing in this suit.
His counsel seek to apply to this case the doctrine laid down
by this court in United S'tates v Zangston, 118 U. S. 389,
but it has no application to the present case. In the Langston
case a prior statute had fixed the annual salary of a diplomatic
officer at a designated sum, without limitation as to time. A
-subsequent statute appropriated a less amount for the services
of th, officer for a particular fiscal year, but contained no
words which expressly or by implication modified or repealed
the prior statute. In the present case, as has been shown, the
prior statute, namely, section 1675 of the Revised Statutes,
has no application, because a different compensation for the
