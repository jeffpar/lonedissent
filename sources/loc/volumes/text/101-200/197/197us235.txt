GREER COUNTY, OKLAHOMA TERRITORY, v. TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS

FOR THE THIRD, SU-

PREME JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE STATE

No. 160.

OF TEXAS.

Submitted March 6, 1905.-Decided March 20, 1905.

The decision in United States v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1, that Greer County was
not within the boundaries of Texas did not effect a cession of the territory included in the county from Texas to the United States or amount
to a transfer of sovereignty, but was simply a revelation that such territory belonged to the United States. Greer County, Oklahoma, as created after that decison by the act of 1896, 29 Stat. 113, is a corporation created by a different sovereignty from that which purported to
create Greer County, Texas, and as such is technically a different person, and does not succeed to land situated elsewhere in Texas granted by
that State prior to such decision for school purposes to Greer County,
Texas.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George Clark, Mr. H. N. Atkinson and Mr. D. C. Bolinger for plaintiff in error:
When a grant is made by a State to an individual or municipal corporation, and the grant is accepted, the contract
is complete; and any action by the State through either its
legislative, executive or judicial department, which tends to
impair the obligation of said contract, is in violation of Sec. 10
of Art. I, of the Constitution of the United States. Fletcher
v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 148; Trust Co. v. Baltimore, 64 Fed.
Rep. 153; Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518; Chicago v. Sheldon, 9 Wall. 50.
When the land in controversy was patented to Greer County,
as a part of Texas, said county took title to the land. Cameron

to Greer County, and that Greer County was not affected by
the result of the litigation between the United States and the
State of Texas. A grant is a contract, and any attempt by
the State of Texas to revoke its grant to Greer County, is,
under the agreed facts of this case, an attempt to impair the
obligation of the contract evidenced by the grant.
The grants evidenced by the patents issued by the State
of Texas vested title in Greer County, which title so vested
was beyond recall by the State through any department of
its government, executive, legislative or judicial. Constitution of Texas, art. 7, § 6; Cameron v. State, 95 Texas, 545;
Milam County v. Bateman, 54 Texas, 166; Palo Pinto County
v. Gano, 60 Texas, 251.
Even though the State itself may have donated the property, it thereby becomes such a vested right as will be protected. Wade on Retroactive Laws, 56; Grogan v. San Francisco, 18 California, 590. Rights of private property are never
affected either by cession, conquest, change of sovereignty or
otherwise, and the change in such sovereignty never divests
rights of property. The decision of this court ir 1895, that
Greer County did not belong to Texas, but was h part of the
domain of the United States, can therefore have no effect upon
the rights of property or grants hitherto made to Greer County
by the -State of Texas. United States v. Roselius, 15 How.
36; Townsend v. Greely, 5 Wall. 326; Dent v. Emmeger, 14
Wall. 308; Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Texas, 234; Musquez v. Blake,

98 U. S. 496.
When the State enters her courts as a suitor, the same law
applies to it as to citizens. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that the State of Texas, through all its departments,
executive, legislative and judicial, at the time the lands were
granted to Greer County, "wasfully aware of the controversy
then existing between the United States and the State of

Texas as to the ownership of said county, and perfected said
grants to Greer County with such knowledge. And where
the means of inquiry or knowledge are equally open to both
parties, if a mistake occurs without fraud or falsehood, neither
party is entitled to relief. Fristoe v. Blum, 92 Texas, 80;

7th ed., 166 et seq.; Fronb. Eq. 116.
The grants to Greer County by the State, being in trust
for public school purposes, the children of that county became the donees of the charity and their rights and interests
cannot be affected by subsequent action on the part of the
State as donor. The fact that Texas has lost her dominion
over Greer County since the grants were made, cannot enter
into the question, as the State thereby is remitted to her
action in the proper tribunals, if so disposed, to prevent or
correct a perversion or waste of the funds' Property given
in charity is always preserved by chancery, and even in cases
where the use fails because illegal, the property does not
revert, but must be applied as near as practicable to the
original intention. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat.

U. S. 51; Croxall v. Shererd, 5 Wall. 281.
Counties may hold property in trust for schools. 1 Beach

Cary, 24 How. 575; 2 Perry on Trusts, § 707; Attorney General
v. Hellis, 2 Simmons & St. Ch. Rep. 77, and the grant was a
grant for charitable use and no matter if Greer County, Texas,
ceased to exist, and no matter whether Greer County, Oklahoma Territory, is its natural or legal successor, or otherwise,
it cannot affect the question; in either or both events a court
of chancery may take charge of the funds and administer them

as near as may be possible according to the intention of the
grantor.
Texas has been reimbursed for these lands. See act of
Congress, April 27, 1904; Doc. & R. 571, Part II, 57th Cong.,
2d Sess., from which it appears that the land sued for in this
case, to-wit: 7,236 acres, was sold by Greer County when she
was a part of Texas, but that afterwards Greer County by
foreclosure of the vendor's lien bought in this 7,236 acres again
and title was revested in Greer County. The balance of the
land, 10,476 acres, became the property of Cameron and was
involved in the suit decided adversely to the State in Cameron
v. State, 95 Texas, 545. The Supreme Court of Texas holding
in that case that the patents were valid and passed the title
to Greer County, and that the Camerons held superior title
to the State.
That the State of Texas has been reimbursed not only for
every expenditure made by her in Greer County during the
existence of her claim to that county, but had been even
reimbursed by the Government for the 10,476 acres of these
lands owned by the Camerons; and it was, at least, inferable
that in case she does not prevail in her suit in this cause the
Government will be equally beneficent and liberal and reimburse her, if she asks for it, for the value of these lands.

between the State of Texas and Greer County, Texas, a legal
subdivision of the State, now nonexistent, and if there has
been any impairment of this contract, it does not in any
way concern plaintiff in error, or affect its rights. But there
has been in no sense an impairment of the obligation of this
contract by the decisions of the Texas courts, and finally
neither in the judgment of the state court nor in the assignments of error in this court, not in the brief of counsel, is there
any reference to any legislation with reference to the matter.
The case was decided upon the general principles of law governing the case and applicable to the facts presented. The
provisions of § 10, Art. I, Constitution United States, do not
apply. Knox v. Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379; Central Land
Co. v. Laidley, 159 U. S. 103, 109.
The effect of the judgment of the state court was in no
sense the taking of private property for public use without
making compensation, as charged in the fourth assignment
of error, even if, as is assumed by plaintiff in error, there
were any inhibition in the Federal Constitution, of such action by the State.
Greer County, Texas, the grantee in the patents, was a
political subdivision and a de facto municipal corporation of
the State of Texas, and its existence as such was terminated

Texas, 1895, Arts. 756, 789.
The grant of four leagues of land for school purposes was
not to the territory embraced within the limits of Greer

of the county as such, and to be administered under the, general control and supervision of the legislature. Constitution,

MR. JUSTIcE HOLNIEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the State of Texas to recover certain lands in Hockley and Cochran Counties, Texas, for which
patents were issued to Greer County, Texas, on July 18, 1887,
under color of the general laws of the State granting four
leagues of land to each county of the State for school purposes.
Texas Gen. Laws, 1883, c. 55. Greer County, Texas, was
created by an act of February 8, 1860, and was organized as
a county in 1886. In March, 1896, it was decided by this
court that the territory known as Greer County belonged to
the United States and not to the State of Texas. United States
v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1. Thereupon by act of Congress of May 4,
1896, c. 155, the same territory was organized as Greer County,
Oklahoma, the present defendant, plaintiff in error. 29 Stat.
113. On April 13, 1897, Texas passed a law purporting to set
aside the land in controversy for the support of schools in

GREER COUNTY v. TEXAS.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Texas and directing proceedings to recover the land against
all adverse claims. Gen. Laws, 1897, c. 72. Then this suit
was brought. The defendant, among other things, set up that
the State was attempting to impair the obligation of its grant.
The case was heard on agreed facts and the State District
Court decided in favor of the State on the ground that the
general laws of Texas authorized patents to be issued to the
counties of Texas only, and that therefore the patents were
void. Another suit was brought against a purchaser from the
de facto Texas county of a part of the land, in which the Supreme Court of the State decided that the purchaser got a
good title, holding that the action of the state legislature still
was conclusive on the court notwithstanding the decision in
United States v. Texas; Cameron v. State, 95 Texas, 545.
The present cause was taken to the Court of Civil Appeals,
which distinguished Cameron v. State, and affirmed the judgment on the different ground that the grant was for public
school purposes within the State of Texas, and, as the defendant could not and would not use the land for such purposes,
the State was entitled to have the patents cancelled and to
recover the land. 31 Texas Civ. App. 223. Then a writ of
error was obtained from this court to enforce the constitutional right alleged by the defendant as stated above.
The decisions below and in Cameronv. Texas suggest interesting questions, which it is not necessary to answer. It may
be doubted how far any court can be bound by legislation after
this court declared such legislation beyond the power of the
State, any more than it would be if the law had been held
unconstitutional. It would be curious to consider whether
the mutual mistake in a matter which, on the face of the
transaction, obviously went to the root of the gift was of such
a nature as to warrant an avoidance when the mistake was
discovered, including the question whether the mistake was
one of law or fact. See Bispham v. Price,_15 How. 162; Upton
v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S. 45; Snell v. Insurance Co., 98 U. S. 85,
90-92; Griswold v. Hazard, 141 U. S. 260, 284; Hirschfeld v.
VOL. cxCvII-16

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

197 U. S.

London, Brighton & South Coast Ry., 2 Q. B. D. 1. There is
the further consideration whether the gift created a public
charity, as contended by the plaintiff in error, and if so, or
whatever the nature of the trust, whether there is such a failure of the donee as to invalidate the gift and to destroy the
legal title of the defendant, if otherwise good. See Stratton
v. Physio-Medical College, 149' Massachusetts, 505, 508, and
cases cited.
We shall consider none of these questions, because we are
of opinion that the plaintiff in error must fail on the short
ground that it is a stranger to the gift. The plaintiff in error
treats the change brought about by the decision in 162 U. S.
1, as if it had been a cession of territory or mere transfer of
sovereignty by that or other means. It was nothing of the
sort. It was a discovery that the State of Texas never had
had a title to the land known as Greer County. The United
States found itself at liberty to do what it chose with that
land. It could have done nothing. It could have subdivided
it at will. It could have made it part of some existing county.
The land and its inhabitants retained no legal personality,
least of all that personality with which Texas had purported
to endow them. The United States, it is true, very properly
did what it could to preserve the former condition of things.
By § 1 of the act of May, 1896, c. 155, 29 Stat. 113, it provided that "all public buildings and property of every description heretofore belonging to Greer County, Texas, or used
in the administration of the public business thereof is hereby
declared to be the property of said Greer County, Oklahoma,"
and otherwise it did all in its power to keep up the legal continuity of the county with the supposed old one. But some
things were not within its power, and one thing which it could
not do was to make an artificial creation of its own successor
to the title to lands in Texas, supposing that title to have been
parted with, by its independent fiat. Without the consent
of Texas no corporation created by another sovereignty could
succeed to Texas lands.

GREER COUNTY v. TEXAS.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Greer County, Oklahoma, being a corporation created by a
different sovereignty from that which purported to create
Greer County, Texas, is technically a different person. It can
claim the legal title, which Texas purported to convey to a
creation of its own, only by succession, or that feigned identity
familiar in the cases of executor and heir. See Day v. Worcester, Nashua & Rochester R. R., 151 Massachusetts, 302,
307, 308; Littleton, § 337; North v. Butts, Dyer, 139b, 140a;
Oates v. Frith, Hob. 130. But succession to land is governed wholly by the law of the place where the land lies. De
Vaughn v. Hutchinson, 165 U. S. 566, 570. The land in controversy was no part of Greer County, but lies in Texas, and
Texas, so far from having assented to the succession of the
defendant, has assumed to deal with the land as its own, by
legislation, and has directed this suit to be brought to recover
it. The legal title of the State is clear, for on the disappearance
of the de facto county the State took whatever title that county
had. See Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472. The legal
title is what is in question before us, and the actual continuity
of the inhabitants of the county could be recognized only by
way of trust. But it would be wrong to encourage the notion
that the title still may be charged with a trust in favor of
schools in Greer County. The aim of the statute, under which
the patents were made out, was the support of Texas schools.
That was its dominant purpose. We think it unlikely that
any court of equity would deem it equitable to direct the fund
to any other trust.
Judgment affirmed.
