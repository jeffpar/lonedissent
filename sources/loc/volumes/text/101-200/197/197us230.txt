OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Argument for Appellant

197 U. S.

BARTLETT v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No.-259. Submitted February 27, 1905.-Decided March 13, i905.
The words "waters and shores" of a river as used in §§ 2550, 2551, Rev.
Stat., are broad enough to include the whole of a city on those shores
and within the limits named. The Collection District of Georgetown
includes the whole of the city of Washington, D. C., and the Secretary
of the Treasury has no power, general or statutory, under §§ 3657, 3658,
Rev. Stat., to appoint, and allow compensation to, a disbursing agent
for funds appropriated for building a post office in Washington.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. J. M. Vale for appellant:
No legislative authorization was required to empower the
Secretary of the Treasury to contract with appellant as set
out in findings of fact 2 and 3 (Record, pp. 4 and 5); such
power is incident to the general sovereignty of the United
States. Dugan v. United States, 3 Wheat. 172; United States
v. Tingey, 5 Pet. 114; United States v. Bradley, 10 Pet. 343;
Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229; United States v. Maunce,
2 Brock. 96.
The duties of appellant as disbursing clerk of the Treasury
Department are such as the Secretary of the Treasury may
prescribe. They are not otherwise defined by law. The Secretary of the Treasury did not prescribe the duties of disbursing agent for the Post Office, Washington, D. C., as part of or
additional to the duties of appellant as disbursing clerk'of
the Treasury Department. On the contrary the Secretary
separates the former from the latter by the terms of appellant's
appointment as disbursing agent for the Post Office. Rev.
Stat. §§ 173, 174, 176.
The city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, the

place of the location of the public work, was not the place
"f the location of the port of Georgetown, in the District of
Columbia, for the purpose of making disbursements for the
Post Office building at the city of Washington. No collector
of customs was-located at the city of Washington, the place
of the public work. Sections 2550, 2551, 3658, Rev. Stat.,
act of February 11, 1895, 28 Stat. 650.
Appellant is entitled to recover under the authority of:
Converse v. United States, 21 How. 463; United States v.
Brindle, 110 U. S. 688; United States v. Saunders, 120 U. S.
126.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradt and Mr. Special
Attorney Frederick de C. Faust for the United States:
The Secretary of the Treasury had no power to appoint claimant to the duties specified in the letter of November 27, 1891.
Sections 3657, 3658, 255, Rev. Stat. and act of August 7,
1882, 22 Stat. 306, govern the case. As to collector in Washington see §§ 2550, 2551, Rev. Stat., 28 Stat. 650; as to salaried officers of the United States receiving compensation for
discharging duties of any other office see §§ 1760, 1763-1765,
Rev. Stat.; United States v. Saunders, 120 U. S. 126.
The act making appropriations for the construction of this
post office required the Secretary of the Treasury to disburse
the money and did not contain any provision whatever for
payment of compensation for such service. 26 Stat. 174, 413;
27 Stat. 351, 573; 28 Stat. 373, 913; 29 Stat. 415; 30 Stat. 13.
No office of disbursing agent was created by those acts. In
the execution thereof and in conformity with the duty thus
conferred, the Secretary of the Treasury appointed the disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department to make these disbursements.
At the time these services were rendered appellant was an
officer in the public service, and, as such, was receiving pay
or salary as fixed by law. He was the proper officer and the
one naturally to be selected for these duties, which, as stated by

the court below, "were not only germane to his regular duties
as disbursing clerk, but were identical therewith, and hence
they cannot be considered as two distinct offices or employments having different duties.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims
rejecting the claim of the appellant. 39 C. Cl. 338. The
claimant while a disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department
received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, as follows: "George A. Bartlett, disbursing clerk, Treasury Department, Washington, D. C. Sir: You are hereby appointed
disbursing agent for such funds as may be advanced to you
from time to time on account of the appropriation for postoffice, Washington, D. C. You will be entitled to such compensation for the services named as is provided by law, and
the same rate of compensation will be allowed on all amounts
disbursed by you since October 15, 1891, on account of the
appropriation named." Directions followed.
The claimant gave no new bond and took no additional oath
of office. He proceeded to disburse nearly two and a half
millions of dollars and claims three-eighths of one per cent
upon the sum disbursed.
The claimant puts his right to compensation on two grounds,
the general powers of the Secretary of the Treasury apart from
statute, and Rev. Stat. § 3658. As to the lformer it is enough
to say that whatever power the Secretary might have in the
absence of legislation, Congress has dealt with the subject so
fully that it is plain that we must look to the statutes alone.
Rev. Stat. §§ 1760-1765, 3657, 3658, 255. Act of August 7,
1882, c. 433; 22 Stat. 302, 306. Looking to the statutes, the
claimant relies on Rev. Stat. §3658: "When there is no
collector at the place of location of any public work specified
in the preceding section [which section specifies post-offices],
the Secretary of the Treasury may appoint a disbursing agent

BARTLETT v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

for the payment of all moneys appropriated for the construction of any such public work, with such compensation as he
may deem equitable and just." It is urged that there is no
collector at Washington, the place of location of the public
work concerned.
The statutes as to the collector for Washington are as follows: Rev. Stat. § 2550. "There shall be in the District of
Columbia one collection-district, as follows: The district of
Georgetown; to comprise all the waters and shores of the
Potomac River within the State of Maryland and the District
of Columbia from Pomonkey Creek to the head of the navigable waters of that river; in which Georgetown shall be the
port of entry." § 2551. "There shall be in the district of
Georgetown a collector." It appears from § 2550 that the
collection district of Georgetown is more extensive than the
city of Georgetown. And this is not changed by the later
statute making Georgetown a part of Washington. Act of
February 11, 1895, c. 79, 28 Stat. 650. We do not perceive
on what ground it is denied that the Washington post office
is within this district. The words, "shores of the Potomac
River," seem to us broad enough to include the whole of
a city on those shbres and within the other limits named.
"Waters and shores" is the usual phrase in Rev. Stat. Title 34,
c. 1, §§ 2517-2612. The words "in which" assume that
Georgetown is embraced within the district. If within the
district it is so simply because it is on the shores as that word
is used in § 2550, and if Georgetown is within it Washington
is in it also, on the same ground. The same form of expression
and the same assumption constantly recur in other sections.
To show still further that collection districts run inland and
are not limited to the mathematical line which bounds the
water, it -may be observed that, while "waters and shores"
is the most common expression, a district frequently is declared to include towns; e. g., § 2517, Seventh, Thirteenth;
§ 2522; § 2531, First, Second; § 2533, First. It may include
lands, § 2519; or embrace a county, § 2517, First, Sixth; or

even a State, § 2522. If Washington is within the collection
district, then there was a collector at the place of location of
the Waslington post office, see § 3657, and the authority of
the Secretary to appoint a disbursing agent under §3658 was,
excluded by its very words.
The claimant does not contend that his case gets any appreciable help from the -act of August 7, 1882, c. 433, 22 Stat.
306. That gives the compensation allowed by law to collectors of customs to disbursing agents appointed to disburse
any appropriation for any United States post office or other
buildings, "not located within the city of Washington." No
other statute is relied upon. No doubt the Secretary was
under the impression, when the letter was written, that he was
making an appointment which would entitle the claimant to
distinct compensation for new work and responsibility. He
did not regard the claimant as designated to be disbursing
agent within the claimant's district under Rev. Stat. § 255,
and therefore as not entitled to any additional pay. Rev.
Stat. §§ 1764, 1765. But we do not see how the case can be
put any higher. It is agreed that the claimant was not appointed to a new office by the Secretary's letter. Therefore,
no help is to be got from United States v. Saunders, 120 U. S..
126, 129. The case is a hard one, but we are of opinion that
the decision of the Court of Claims was right.
Judgment affirmed.
