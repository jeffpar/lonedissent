Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

197 U. S.

LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE RAILROAD COMPANY
v. BARBER ASPHALT PAVING COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY.
No, 170.

Argued March 7, 8, 1905.-Decided April 3, 1905.

In determining whether an improvement does, or does not, benefit property
within the assessment district, the land should be considered simply in
its general relations and apart from its particular use at the time; and
an assessment, otherwise legal, for grading, paving and curbing an adjoining street is not void under the Fourteenth Amendment because the lot is
not benefited by the improvement owing to its present particular use.
A system of delusive exactness should not be extracted from the very
general language of the Fourteenth Amendment in order to destroy
methods of taxation which were well known when the Amendment was
adopted, and which no one then supposed would be disturbed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

T. K. Helm were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:.
The only constitutional basis for taxation by special assessment upon selected property, as distinguished from general

This court has sustained the Kentucky method of assessment in Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578. There is nothing in
the fact that the lot involved in this case is a railroad right of
way which differentiates it from other property in the district.
It is property. Keener v. U'nion Pacific, 31 Fed. Rep. 128;

MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a proceeding under the Kentucky Statutes, ยง 2834,
to enforce a lien upon a lot adjoining a part of Frankfort
avenue, in Louisville, for grading, curbing and paving with
asphalt the carriageway of that part of the avenue. The defendant, the plaintiff in error, pleaded that its only interest
in the lot was a right of way for its main roadbed, and that
neither the right of way nor the lot would or could get any
benefit from the improvement, but on the contrary rather
would be hurt by the increase of travel close to the defendant's
tracks. On this ground it set up that any special assessment
would deny to it the equal protection of the laws, contrary to
the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. It did not object to the absence of the parties having
any reversionary interest, but defended against any special
assessment on the lot. The answer was demurred to, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, and this judgment was
affirmed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. 76 S. W. Rep.
1097. A writ of error was taken out, and the case was brought
to this court. It will be noticed that the case concerns only
grading, curbing and paving, and what we shall have to say
is confined to a case of that sort.
The State of Kentucky created this lien by a statute entitled "An act for the government of cities of the first class."
Louisville is the only city of the first class at present in Kentucky, and the general principles of the act are taken verbatim
from the part of the charter of Louisville which was considered
and upheld by this court in Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578.
But we take the statute as a general prospective law and not
as a legislative adjudication concerning a particular place and
a particular plan such as may have existed in Spencer v.
Merchant, 125 U. S. 345, and as was thought to exist in Smith

v. Worcester, 182 Massachusetts, 232, referred to at the argument.
The law provides in the case of original construction, such
as this improvement was, that it shall be made at the exclusive
cost of the adjoining owners, to be equally apportioned according to the number of feet owned by them. In the case of a
square or subdivision of land bounded by principal streets,
which the land including the defendant's lot was held to be,
see Cooper v. Nevin, 90 Kentucky, 85; Nevin v. Roach, 86
Kentucky, 492, 499, the land is assessed half way back from
the improvement to the next street. Acts of .1898, c. 48.
Ky. Stat. ยง 2833' A lien is imposed upon the land and "the
general council, or the courts in which suits may be pending,
shall make all corrections, rules, and orders to do justice to all
parties concerned." Section 2834. The principle of this mode
of taxation seems to have been familiar in Kentucky for the
better part of a hundred years. Lexington v. McQuillan, 9
Dana, 513.
The argument for the plaintiff in error oscillates somewhat
between the objections to the statute and the more specific
grounds for contending that it cannot be applied constitutionally to the present case. So far as the former are concerned
they are disposed of by the decisions of this court. There is a
look of logic when it is said that special assessments are founded
on special benefits and that a law which makes it possible to
assess beyond the amount of the special benefit attempts to
rise above its source. But that mode of argunwnt assumes an
exactness in the premises which does not exist. The foundation of this familiar form of taxation is a question of theory.
The amount of benefit which an improvement will confer upon
particular land, indeed whether it is a benefit at all, is a matter
of forecast and estimate. In its general aspects at least it is
peculiarly a thing to be decided by those who make the law.
The result of the supposed constitutioual Principle is siniply to
shift the burden to a somewhat large laxing district, the municipality, and to disguise rather thm,. to answer lie theoretic

doubt. It is dangerous to tie down legislatures too closely by
judicial constructions not necessarily arising from the words
of the Constitution. Particularly, as was intimated in Spencer
v. Merchant, 125 U. S. 345, it is important for this court to
avoid extracting from the very general language of the Fourteenth Amendment a system of delusive exactness in order to
destroy methods of taxation which were well known when that
Amendment was adopted and which it is safe to say that no
one then supposed would be disturbed. It now is established
beyond permissible controversy that laws like the one before
us are not contrary to the Constitution of the United States.
Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578; French v. Barber Asphalt
Paving Co., 181 U. S. 324; Webster v. Fargo, 181 U. S. 394;
Cass Farm Co. v. Detroit, 181 U. S. 396; Detroit v. Parker,
181 U. S. 399; Chadwick v. Kelley, 187 U. S. 540, 543, 544;
Schaefer v. Werling, 188 U. S. 516; Seattle v. Kelleher, 195
U. S. 351, 358.
A statute like the present manifestly might lead to the assessment of a particular lot for a sum larger than the value of the
benefits to that lot. The whole cost of the improvement is
distributed in proportion to area, and a particular area might
receive no benefits at all, at least if its present and probable
use be taken into account. If that possibility does not invalidate the act it would be surprising if the corresponding fact
should invalidate an assessment. Upholding the act as embodying a principle generally fair and doing as nearly equal
justice as can be expected seems to import that if a particular
case of hardship arises under it in its natural and ordinary
application, that hardship must be borne as one of the imperfections of human things. And this has been the iniplication of the cases. Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 106;
Mattingly v. Districtof Columbia, 97 U. S. 687, 692; Parsons v.
Districtof Columbia, 170 U. S. 45, 52, 55; Detroit v. Parker,181
U. S. 399, 400; Chadwick v. Kelley, 187 U. S. 540, 544.
But in this case it.is not necessary to stop with these general
considerations. The plea plainly means that the improve-

ment will not benefit the lot because the lot is occupied. for
railroad purposes and will continue so to be occupied. Compare Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. v. Chicago, 166 U. S.
226, 257, 258. That, apart from the specific use to which .this
land is devoted, land in a good-sized city generally will get a
benefit front having the streets about it paved, and that this
benefit generally will be more than the cost, are propositions
which, as we already have implied, a legislature is warranted
in adopting.

But, if so, we are of opinion that the legislature

is warranted in going one step further and saying that on the
question of benefit or no benefit the land shall be considered
simply in its general relations and apart from its particular
use. See Illinois Central R. R. v. Decatur, 147 U. S. 190. On
the question of benefits the present use is simply a prognostic,
and the plea a prophecy.

If an occupant could not escape by

professing his desire for solitude and silence, the legislature
may make a similar desire fortified by structures equally
ineffective. It may say that it is enough that the land could

be turned to purposes for which the paving would increase its
value. Indeed, it is apparent that the prophecy in the answer
cannot be regarded as absolute, even while the present use of
the land continues-for no one can say that changes might not
make a station desirable at this point; in which case the advantages of a paved street could not be denied. We are not
called on to say that we think the assessment fair. But we are
compelled to (leclare that it does not go beyond the bounds
set by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States.
