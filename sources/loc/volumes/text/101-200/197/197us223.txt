UNITED STATES v. MILLS.
Statement of the Case.

197 U. S.

But I cannot agree in holding that the trial court erred in
not taking the case from the jury. Without going into the
details of the evidence, I care only to say that, in my opinion,
there was evidence tending to make a case within the statute.
The opinion of the court concedes that there was abundant
testimony to show that the accused with another went from
Georgia to Florida to arrest the two negroes, Gordon and
Ridley, and take them against their will back to Georgia to
work out a debt. And they were taken to Georgia by force.
It is conceded that peonage is based upon the indebtedness
of the peon to the master. The accused admitted to one of
the witnesses that the negroes owed him. In any view, there
was no motion or request to direct a verdict for the defendant.
The accused made no objection to the submission of the case
to the jury, and it is going very far to hold in a case like this,
disclosing barbarities of the worst kind against these negroes,
that the trial court erred in sending the case to the jury.

1900, and March 2, 1901, making appropriations for the Army.
The particular provisions of these acts are set forth in the
margin.'
The court gave judgment in favor of appellee upon the
authority of its opinion in Irwin v. United States, 38 C. Cl. 87.
The facts found by the court are as follows'
"The claimant, Stephen C. Mills, entered the military service of the United States as a cadet at the Military Academy,
July 1, 1873, was commissioned second lieutenant June 15,
1877, and by successive promotions became major and
inspector-general July 25, 1888, and lieutenant-colonel and
inspector-general February 2, 1901, and still holds the lastnamed rank and office.
โข"The claimant was, by proper military orders, on duty
with the Army of the United States in the Philippine Islands
from a date prior to May 26, 1900, continuously until April 15,
1902, when, in accordance with orders, he arrived at San
Francisco, California, on his return from said Philippine Islands. During all of that period he was serving in the Philippine Islands and beyond the limits of the States comprising
the Union and the Territories of the United States contiguous
thereto.
"During the entire period from May 26, 1900, to April 15,
1902, named in the next preceding finding, the claimant while

"That hereafter 'the pay proper of all officers and enlisted men serving
in Porto Rico, Cuba, the Philippine Islands, Hawaii and in the Territory
of Alaska shall be increased ten per centum for officers and twenty per
centum for enlisted men over and above the rates of pay proper as fixed by
law in time of peace."
Act of March 2, 1901, 31 Stat. 895, 903; 1 Comp. Stat. 896.
"That hereafter the pay proper of all officers and enlisted men serving
beyond the limits of the States comprising the Union, and the Territories
of the United States contiguous thereto, shall be increased ten per centum
for officers and twenty per centum for enlisted men over and above the rates
of pay proper as fixed by law for time of peace, and the time of such service
shall be counted from the date of departure from said States to the date
of
return thereto,"

Opinion of the Court.

holding the rank of major was paid at the rate of $2,500 a
year, the minimum pay of the grade of major established by
section 1261 of the Revised Statutes; $1,000 longevity increase
established by section 1262 of the Revised Statutes, and $250
a year as the increase 'of ten per cent. upon his pay proper
provided by the act of May 26, 1900, 31 Stat. 211, but
calculated only upon the minimum or grade pay fixed by said
section 1261.
"While holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel during said
period the claimant was paid at the rate of $3,000 a year, the
minimum pay of that grade as provided by section 1261 of the
Revised Statutes, $1,000 longevity increase provided by section 1262, and $300 a year as ten per cent. increase on his pay
proper as provided by the acts of May 26, 1900, and March 2,
1901 (31 Stat. 211, 903), but computed only on the minimum
pay of the grade.
"If said ten per cent. increase should be calculated upon
the total pay of $3,500 received by the claimant while in the
rank of major, his increase would be at the rate of $350 a year
instead of $250, and.if so calculated while he was in the rank
of lieutenant-colonel the increase would be at the rate of $400
a year instead of $300, making a difference of $100 a year for
the period covered by the claim, and aggregating, for the entire
period $188.87."

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The question is, upon what principal sum the ten per cent
increase of compensation, to which the Government concedes
the appellee is entitled, is to be computed. The appellee as

major was entitled, by section 1261 of the Revised Statutes,
1 Comp. Stat. 893, to the pay of $2,500 a year. Subsequently
as lieutenant-colonel he was entitled, by the same section, to
the pay of $3,000 per year. By the following section, 1262,
1 Comp. Stat. 896, it is provided that there shall be paid-to
the officers below the rank of brigadier-general "ten per
centum of their current yearly pay for each term of five years
of service," and by section 1263 the total amount of such
increase for length of service cannot exceed, in any case,
"forty per centum on the yearly pay of the grade as provided
by law." Under section 1262 the appellee had become entitled to pay to the amount of $1,000 a year in addition to the
pay provided for in section 1261; thus, as major, he was
entitled to $2,500 per year, and under section 1262, $1,000
more, or $3,500 under these two sections; as lieutenant-colonel
he was paid $3,000 per year under section 1261 and $1,000
more under section 1262, or $4,000 under these two sections.
He contended that the additional ten per cent under the acts
of 1900 and 1901 should be computed on the respective sums
of $3,500 and $4,000, the total compensation granted by the
two sections, while the Government insists that the percentage
must be computed upon the sums of $2,500 and $3,000 respectively, the minimum pay granted to the grades of major
and lieutenant-colonel.
The Court of Claims directed the computation to be made
on the total of the sums given by the two sections, and in our
opinion that court was right in so doing. The term "pay
proper" used in the acts of-May 26, 1900, and March 2, 1901,
includes, in our opinion, the longevity pay under section 1262
as well as the sum named as pay under section 1261, the latter
being the minimum sum for the grade. Every five years of
service, under section 1262, up to a certain percentage of the
yearly pay of the grade, as provided by law, section 1263,
entitles the officer to be paid ten per centum of his yearly pay.
The term "current yearly pay," (see. 1262), was the subject
of examination as to its meaning in United States v. Tyler,

UNITED STATES v. MILLS.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Cqurt.

105 U. S. 244. tihe case related to the claim of a retired
officer, and the question was, whether he was entitled to the
benefit of the section (1262) after his retirement; and, also, if
he were so entitled, how was the computation to be made.
The court held that he was entitled to the benefit of the section, and that the percentage was to be computed on the total
amount of the pay of the officer, increased as it might be by
the periods of five years of service. Thus the increased pay
derived from additional periods of five years' service was added
to the minimum pay of the grade, and ten per centum of that
total was held to be the proper compensation.
The Government, however, contends that the term "current yearly pay," mentioned in section 1262, has a different
meaning from the tercm "pay proper," contained in the acts
under discussion, and it insists that the latter term is not as
comprehensive as the former. We do not think that there
is any such material difference between the two expressions
as in this case to demand their different construction. "Current yearly pay" and "pay proper," as used in the sections,
mean the regular, ordinary pay which an officer may be entitled to under the facts in his case, and if, by virtue of length
of service, he is entitled to receive the compensation provided
for in section 1262, that compensation is his "pay," or his
"pay proper," as distinguished from possible other compensation by any allowances, or commutation, or otherwise. The
method of computation adopted herein by the Court of Claims
is the same as that adopted in United States v. Tyler, supra;
that method has therefore received the approval of this court,
or at least it has been held that the ten per centum of the
current yearly pay is to be calculated upon the aggregate pay
provided for in the two sections (1261 and 1262), and not
merely upon the minimum pay granted by section 1261.
In regard to retired officers, Congress subsequently provided otherwise. 22 Stat. 117, 118.
The words, "pay proper," we see no reason to think are to
be construed differently from the word "pay."
The term

means compensation, which may properly be described or
designated as "pay," as distinguished from allowances, commutations for rations or other methods of compensation, not
specifically described as pay.
The Government refers to the act of CongreSs approved
March 15, 1898 (army appropriation act, 30 Stat. 318), as
giving some ground for the contention it makes in this case,
because, as is stated, Congress itself therein distinguishes between "pay proper," and "additional pay for length of service," and it is urged that pay proper does not include longevity
pay in the opinion of Congress as expressed in the act. The
provision of the act is as follows:
"For pay proper of enlisted men of all grades, four million
two hundred and ninety thousand dollars.
"Additional pay for length of service, including hospital
corps, six hundred and seventy-one thousand one hundred
and seventy-two dollars."
The act cited by the Government, it will be seen, refers to
enlisted men and not to officers at all. In that same act of
1898 provision for the payment of officers is in the following language (30 Stat. 318):
"For pay of officers of the line, two million eight hundred
sixty-five thousand dollars.
"For pay of officers for length of service,
to be paid with
their current monthly pay, seven hundred and ninety thousand dollars."
And in the appropriation act of March 3, 1899, the appropriation for enlisted men was changed so that it reads as
follows (30 Stat. 1064, 1065):
"Pay of enlisted men of all grades, including recruits,
thirteen million five hundred thousand dollars.
"For additional pay for length of service, seven hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars."
Under the language of the act of March 15, 1898, the Comptroller. of the United States had held that the language used
in that act showed that the compensation of enlisted men,

UNITED STATES v. MILLS.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

upon which the per centum provided for was to be computed,
was the minimum pay, not enlarged by any longevity pay
to which the person was entitled. At the very next session
of Congress the form of the appropriation was changed, as we
have seen. That change has been continued since. See acts
of May 26, 1900, 31 Stat. 206; March 2, 1901, 31 Stat. 896;
June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 508; March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 929, and
April 23, 1904, 33 Stat. 260.
The ground for arguing that the term "pay proper" does
not include the "additional pay for length of service" was
thus taken away by a change in the form of the appropriation
in all the acts subsequent to that of 1898. As we have already
stated, however, that particular form in regard to enlisted
men in the act of 1898 was never adopted, providing for the
pay of officers. Their regular compensation and their compensation by reason of longevity services are both spoken of
in that act as "pay."
We have no doubt that the pay of the officer under the
statutes of 1900 and 1901, in connection with the Revised
Statutes referred to, consists of the amount granted for lon-.
gevity service as well as of the amount provided in section 1261,
and that the total is "pay proper," upon which total the
percentage is to be computed provided foNbn the acts of 1900
and 1901. Our attention has not been called to any decision
of this court looking to the contrary principle.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is right and must be
Affirmed.
