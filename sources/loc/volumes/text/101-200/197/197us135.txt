UNITED STATES v. WHITRIDGE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 413. Argued January 27, 30, 1905.-Decided February 27, 1905.

Under the proviso of § 25 of the act of Congress of August 27, 1898, 28
Stat. 509, 552, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized, when he has
satisfactory evidence that the rupee price of imported goods stated in
the invoice does not mean rupees at bullion value, but as a certain fraction of a pohind sterling, to order a reliquidation so as to make the value
in United States currency correspond with the actual value of the goods.
In determining when the Secretary of the Treasury exceeded his powers
under a statute, this court may consider public- facts that were known
to Congress when enacting the statute and must have been before the
Secretary's mind when acting thereunder, even though such facts were
not proved on the trial.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

the Solicitor General was on the brief for the United States:

value of the rupee was greatly affected by the depreciation
of silver owing to the closing of the Indian mints. See Lord
Herschell's Report of Currency Committee, printed August 18,
1893, by Congress of United States.
Silver rupees since September, 1899, have been in fact only
token coins like the silver dollars of the United States, or, in

The adtion of the Secretary of the Treasury in declaring
the value of the rupee of the invoice, when he ordered reliquidation of the entry, in June, 1901, was final and conclusive, and could not be reviewed or the facts upon which the
same was based inquired into by appraisers or courts.
Section 25 of the act of 1894 has two important parts:
First, the provisions for valuing foreign coins taken from the
act of 1873 requiring an annual estimate, as modified by the
act of 1890 requiring quarterly estimates; and, second, the
proviso relating to reliquidation, which was entirely new
legislation. As to the first part see cases cited supra. As
to the second part see Muser v. Magone, 155 U. S. 240, 251;
United States v. Passavant,169 U. S.16.
Since September 15, 1899, the monetary standard of India
has been gold, the standard coin the British sovereign (worth
$4.8665) and the rupee, a token coin, current as the onefifteenth part thereof-$0.324--. The Secretary, therefore,
committed no error of which the importers can complain when
he reliquidated the entry in question, valuing the rupee at
$0.32. He erred when he proclaimed on April, 1900, that
India was on a silver standard and the rupee was worth $0.207.
The proviso in § 25, act of 1894, gave the Secretary the
right to direct reliquidaion of an entry at the exchange value
of the monqy specified in the invoi~e whenever that was
10 per cent more -or less than the metallic value proclaimed
at the beginning of the quartef, and such right did not depend on a change in the market value of the metal in the coin.

Argument for Respondents.

197 U. S.

The construction of the act of 1894 by the lower courts
renders it ineffective. A statute should be construed by considering the reasons and spirit of it and the cause for its enactment, and where particular construction would occasion great
inconvenience or produce inequality and injustice, that view
is to be avoided if another and more reasonable interpretation is present in the statute. Blackstone's Com., vol. 1,
p. 61; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 77.
Both rules justify the construction asked by the Government of the proviso in section 25, act 1894.
The construction contended for by the importers would
great
defeat the beneficial ends above specified and cause
inequality, injustice and loss by reason of past transactions, and possibly still worse consequences from future
ones.

Other governments contemplate changes from gold to silver
conbasis. Report Director of Mint, 1904, 99. For rules of

values of currencies. It covered only depreciations, and the
manifest way to accomplish what the Government thinks
was intended, would have been to amend it. Section 2903,
Rev. Stat.; T. D. 17,107, May 12, 1896; T. D. 17,766, February 3, 1897.
Analysis of the very terms of the proviso shows that the
construction for which respondents contend, is the correct
one. T. D. 22,747, is manifestly absurd.
Conditions prevailing at and shortly prior to the enactment in question, compel the conclusion that bullion fluctuations, and not those of exchange, were in the minds of the
lawmakers.
Section 2903 continued to afford the only means of taking
up the fluctuations of exchange. T. D. 15,606, February 8,
1895; T. D. 24,318, 24,531, 1903.
It cannot be contended that the action of the Secretary,
because it followed the language of the proviso to section 25,
was final and conclusive and cannot be scrutinized even to see
what it really was. The Second Bebee Case, 117 Fed. Rep.

The general law with reference to the legal effect of the act
of an official entirely supports the claim that the Secretary's
action is reviewable. Am. School of Healing v. McAnnulty, 187

Opinion of the Court.

197 U. S.

The Secretary had no power to repudiate the duly ascertained and proclaimed pure metal value of the rupee, outside
the terms of the proviso to section 25.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
Whitridge, White & Co., the respondents, on June 18, 1900,
imported from India certain gunnies, invoiced in rupees. 'The
invoice contained a certificate from the American consul, dated
April 19, 1900, that the exchange value of the rupee at that
date was thirty-two cents estimated in United States gold
dollars. For the purpose of ascertaining the ad valorem duties
under the act of July 24, 1897, c. 11, 30 Stat. 151, Schedule J.,
cL 341, in July, 1900, the collector of the port of Baltimore
estimated the vglue of the merchandise at the date of the
consular certificate by converting the invoice value into dollars, taking the rupees at thirty-two cents. The importers
entered protest and the collector reliquidated the entry, taking the rupee at 20.7 cents. The Secretary of the Treasury,
on June 6, 1901, wrote that satisfactory evidence had been
produced to him that the value of the rupee was thirty-two
cents at the date of the consul's certificate, and directed a
reliquidation at that rate. The collector of the port reliquidated accordingly on June 12, 1901. The importers (respondents) protested, and the matter was submitted to the
Board of General Appraisers in New York. Act of June 10,
1890, c. 407, § 14. 26 Stat. 131, 137. The Board found that
the exchange value of the rupee at the date of certification
was thirty-two cents, but that the metal value 'Was 20.7 cents,
as estimated by the Director of the Mint and proclaimed by
the Secretary of the Treasury for the quarter year beginning
April 1, 1900, ruled that the latter rate should have been taken,
and directed a reliquidation on that footing. The collector
appealed to the Circuit Court and then to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, both of which sustained the Board of Appraisers.
129 Fed. Rep. 33. The United States then obtained a writ of

Opinion of the Court.

certiorari from this court. The question is whether the Secretary of the Treasury had power to order reliquidation at the
rate of thirty-two cents.
There is, to be sure, a preliminary question as to the conclusiveness of the Secretary's action under the statute. Technically it does not appear that his decision was not based on a
finding as to the metal value of the rupee; that is to say, as to
the value on April 19, 1900, in fractions of a gold dollar, of the
silver contained in the coin. If the decision were based on
such a finding we may assume that it would not be open to
review. United. States v. Klingenberg, 153 U. S. 93. But the
greater part, at least, of the argument was made on a different
assumption, which, in view of our conclusion, we shall adopt.
We do so the more readily, because upon the public and well
known facts it is not to be supposed that the imagined finding
as to the value o silver was made, and the policy of the Treasury Department to adopt the exchange value of rupees was
well known and publicly declared. It would not be consistent
with the honor of the Government to take the exchange value
and then to cover itself from correction, if it was wrong, by
suggesting that it had gone upon a different ground, when that
ground could not have been taken by any one knowing the
prices of the time. There is another argument for the conclusiveness of the Secretary's action which is so closely connected with the merits that we shall not separate it from our
general discussion of the act.
The power of the Secretary depends on the construction of
the act of August 27, 1894, c. 349, § 25. 28 Stat. 509, 552.1
I "That the value of foreign coin as expressed in the money of account
of the United States shall be that of the pure metal of such coin of standard
value; and the values of the standard coins in circulation of the various
nations of the world shall be estimated quarterly by the Director of the
Mint, and be proclaimed by the Secretary of the Treasury immediately
after the passage of, this act and thereafter quarterly on the first day of
January, April, July, ahd October in each year. And the values so proclaimed shall be followed in estimating the value of all foreign merchandise
exported to the United States during the quarter for which the value is

Opinion of, the Court.

197 U. S.

It is argued for the respondents that the Secretary must derive
his power from the proviso if from anything, that the value
dealt with in this section is the same thing throughout, and
being declared to be that of the pure metal of the coin in the
body of the section, must be the same in the proviso, and that
therefore the Secretary is not authorized to order a reliquidation unless it appears to him that the pure metal in the invoice
coin was worth ten per cent more. or less in American gold than
the value proclaimed. This argument is thought to derive
soipe support from the history of legislation and from the
history of the times, which latter is thought to show that
fluctuations of silver bullion, not fluctuations of exchange
values, were what Congress was likely to have had in mind.
It is suggested further that the Government reading makes
the proviso revolutionize the body of the section and the
practice of a hundred years.
On the other side we start with the consideration that to an
ad valorem tax it must be an object to ascertain the true value
of the thing taxed at the time as of which it is taxed, and that
the invoice price is referred to only to that end. The history
of the statutes, shows a series of continually closer approximations to it, and to our mind helps the contention of the Government, not that of the other 'side. The statutes began by
fixing the rates for specified coins absolutely. Then, in 1873,
they provided in the language of the first part of § 25, quoted
above, for an annual estimate by the. Director of the Mint and
a proclamation. Act of March 3, 1873, c. 268, 17 Stat. 602.

Opinion of the Court.

c. 1244, § 52. 26 Stat. 567, 624. Finally, on August 27, 1894,
the statute received its present form, with the proviso from
which the Secretary derives his clearest grant of power. The
general purpose of this proviso undeniably is to secure a closer
approximation still. In construing it we must bear this obvious purpose in mind. While no doubt the grammatical and
logical scope of a proviso is confined to the subject matter of
the principal clause, we cannot forget that in practice no such
limit is observed, and when, as here, we are dealing with an
addition made in new circumstances to a form of words adopted
many years before, the general purpose is aa more important
aid to the meaning than any rule which grammar or formal
logic may lay down. Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v.
Smith, 128 U. S. 174, 181.
If the proviso were a separate subsequent act we should
note that the case in which the Secretary is authorized to order
a reliquidation is not confined in terms to a difference in the
value of standard coins in circulation, but exists whenever
there is such a difference in the value of the foreign money
specified in the invoice. The invoice is required to be made
out in the currency of the country of export or the currency
actually paid, which may not be coin at all, Act of June 10,
1890, c. 407, § 2. 26 Stat. 131. It is true that the difference
referred to in the proviso is a difference from the proclaimed
value, and that the proclaimed value has reference to standard
coins. Whether, in view of this fact and of Rev. Stat. § 2903,
the words would cover a difference in value between paper
expressed in terms of current coin and current coin, if paper
were the currency shown by the invoice or the consul's certificate to be the currency to which the invoice referred, need not
be considered. That question did not arise in Cramer v.
Arthur, 102 U. S. 612. However that may be, suppose that
the currency mentioned in the invoice, although coined, was
a token currency having by legislative fiat the value of a fraction of some current coin of universal worth, but itself having
no such worth derived from the metal it contained. Such a

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

token might vary in value much below or above the fraction
of the coin by which it purported to be measured. Suppose
that the-value of the latter coin only had been proclaimed. It
would be going far to say that the Secretary could not order a
reliquidation upon Ia variance of more than ten per cent betwden the value of the token currency in the invoice and the
proclaimed value of the governing coin.
The case last put is the case at bar, except that it is not admitted that the rupee was technically a mere token, and that
the value of the rupee itself had been proclairmed, subject to a
note'-'value of the rupee to be determined by consular
certificate." At that time, although it was not noted until
a little later in the year by the Director of the Mint, India was
on a gold basis. As the rupee had a legally fixed ratio to
another coin algo valued by the Director, the gold pound, it is
plain that the value of the rupee as so much silver and its
.,value as a fraction of a pound might fall apart and yet both
be given by the Director's tables. It would be giving a very
literal construction to the body of §25 to say that it forbade
the Secretary to take the fraction of the pound rather than the
silver bullion as the measure of the value of goods, if the
former represented the unit of actual cost. But, supposing
that the fraction of the pound was the unit of cost, it seems to
us that at least under the proviso, if not under the body of the
section, the Secretary could order a reliquidation on the basis
of the units actually used, It would be simply a correction'
'in conformity with the truth and 'the actual meaning of the
words of the invoice. The other argument for the conclusiveness of the' Secretary's action, to which we referred at the
outset, was that, for all that appears, thise may have been what
happened.. The gold which the rupee represents is one shilling
and four pence, or about thirty-two cents. But, as in this
case the exchange value and the value as a fraction of a pound
were the same, it does not matter to our decision whether we
say that in such circumstances the action of the Secretary was
conclusive or say that it was right.

I UNITED STATES v. WIIITRIDGE.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

We have shown that in our opinion the proviso, if not the
body of § 25, would have warranted the action of the Secretary
if it had been a later independent statute. We are of opinion,
that it is not to be construed differently because of its form.
In addition to the considerations which we have mentioned,
we are confirmed in our view by the facts which were known
at the time. It is true that the most conspicuous recent
event was the fluctuation in the value of silver. But the
movement of silver, especiatly after the repeal of the Sherman
Act, on November 1, 1893, 28 Stat. 4, had been downward,
and the proviso contemplated at least equally a possible rise
in the foreign money with which it dealt. On the other hand
there was before Congress the Herschell report on the coinage
of silver in India, of which six thousand copies had been ordered to be printed by a resolve of the Senate, concurred in by
the House, 28 Stat. App. p. 5, and which had been printed in
1893. This report recommended the closing of the mints
against the free coinage of silver, and predicted as a consequence the divergence between tne intrinsic value of the rulee
and the value of its ratio to the pound as fixe'd, taken hypothetically as one shilling and four pence. It contemplated
even a raising of the ratio as possible. The report was followed by the closing of the mints in the same year, and the
result predicted came to pass. However small may have been
the imports from India in 1894, the fact predicted by the
Herschell report was one of the most striking incidents in the
recent financial history of the world, and we cannot sbhppose
that it was not considered when the proviso was passed.
Before the date of this export gold was adopted as'the standard, and the ratio of the rupee fixed at fifteen to one, or one
shilling and four pence, in 1899. The exchange valuie did not'
change very much, remaining at near the conventional ratio,
but the decline in bullion made the divergence referred to more
marked. It was objected that some of the facts which we hav.e
mentioned xuere not proved in the case, but they are public
facts,. and when we are asked to declare that the Secretary

exceeded his power we have to consider what might have been
before his mind.
As we have said, it would be only by a very literal construction of the earlier part of § 25, that the collectors would
be bound to estimate the value of a cargo invoiced in rupees
by the bullion of the rupee when in the invoice rupee meant
a certain fraction of a pound. But, however that may be, we
are of opinion that when the Secretary has satisfactory evidence of that state of facts, under the proviso he is authorized
to order a reliquidation in order to make the value in United
States currency correspond with the actual value of the goods.
It is not necessary to consider any wider problems as to the
power of the Secretary. We confine our decision to the
particular case.
