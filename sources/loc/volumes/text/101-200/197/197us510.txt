WHITAKER v. McBRIDE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA.
No. 135. Submitted January 18, 105.-Decided April 10, 1905.
The question of the title of a riparian owner is one of local law, and unrestricted, grants of the Government, bounded on streams and other
waters, are to be construed according to the law of the State in which
the lands lie. Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S. 371.
Government surveys of public lands are not open to collateral attack in
an action at law between private parties.
A meander line is not a line of boundary but a means of ascertaining the
quantity of land in the fraction which is to be paid for by the purchaser.
Where the Government has surveyed and patented the lands up to the
bank of a channel in which an unsurveyed island is situated, a patentee
of the land on such bank, although his land may itself be. an island surrounded by two channels of the river, has all the rights of a riparian
owner in the channel lying opposite his banks, including the unsurveyed
island if, as a riparian owner, he is entitled thereto by the laws of the
State.
By the law of Nebraska, as interpreted by its highest court, riparian proprietors own the bed of a stream to the center of the channel. The Government as original proprietor has the right to stfrvey and sell any lands,
including islands in a river or any othe body of water, and if it omits
to survey an island in a stream and refuses to do so when its attention
is called to the matter, no citizen, can overrule the Department, and
assuming that the island should be surveyed, occupy it for homestead or
preemption entry. In such a case the rights of riparian owners are to
be preferred to those of the settler.

THIS was an action commenced on June 27, 1898, in the
District Court of Buffalo County, Nebraska, and terminated
by a decision of the Supreme Court of the State. 65 Nebraska,
137. The facts found by the District Court are that McBride
and Killgore were respectively the owners and in possession
of tracts of land bordering on the Platte River, one on the
north and the other on the south side thereof. Between these
two tracts and in the main channel of the Platte River is an
island, containing about twenty-two acres. This island had

Opinion of the Court.

been in the possession of McBride and Killgore for more than
ten years prior to the bringing of the action, but during that
time they were contending as to how much of the land each
was entitled to. It had never been surveyed by the Government.
It appeared in evidence that Whitaker, in 1897, settled on
the island, claiming the right to enter the same as a homestead; that application to the Land Department of the Government to have the island surveyed was in 1897 refused, the
Department declining to take any action in the matter. These
lands were a part of the Fort Kearney Military Reservation,
which was surveyed and sold under a special act of Congress,
dated July 21, 1876, 19 Stat. 94; the patent to McBride, who
had entered his tract as a homestead, bearing date March 28,
1885. There was testimony tending to show that the island
was at the time of the survey of the reservation frequently
covered with water, and that since then-perhaps owing to
the construction of bridges and dykes-overflows had been
less frequent and the land better adapted to occupation and
cultivation. The decree directed by the Supreme Court was
adverse to Whitaker, and quieted the title of McBride and
Killgore to the island, giving to each one-half.

error.

Kinkaid for defendants in error.
MR.

JUSTICE BREWER,

after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the State was that the
owner of lands bordering on a river owns to the center of the
channel, and takes title to any small bodies of land on his side
of the channel that have not been surveyed or sold by the
Government. It is the settled rule that the question of the

title of a riparian owner is one of local law. In Hardin v.
Jordan,140 U. S. 371, the matter was discussed at some length,
the authorities cited, and the conclusion thus stated by Mr.
Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court (p. 384):
"In our judgment the grants of the Government for lands
bounded on streams and other waters, without any reservation
or restriction of terms, are to be construed as to their effect
according to the law of the State in which the lands lie."
• See also Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 45; Lowndes v. Huntington, 153 U. S. 1, 19; Grand Rapids &c. RailroadCompany v.
Butler, 159 U. S. 87, 92; St. Anthony Falls Power Company v.
Water Commissioners, 168 U. S. 349; Kean v. Calumet Canal
Co., 190 U. S. 452; Hardin v. Shedd, 190 U. S. 508.

If there were no island in this case it would not, under these
authorities, be questioned that the title of the riparian owners
extended to the center of the channel. How far does the fact
that there is this unsurveyed island in the river abridge the
scope of the rule? In seeking an answer to this question these
facts must be borne in mind: The official surveys made by the
Government are not open to collateral attack in an action at
law between private parties. Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, 158
U. S. 240; Russell v. Maxwell Land Grant Company, 158 U. S.
253; Horne v. Smith, 159 U. S. 40. A meander line is not a
line of boundary, but one designed to point out the sinuosity
of the bank or shore, and a means of ascertaining the quantity
of land in the fraction which is to be paid for by the purchaser.
RailroadCompany v. Schurmeir, 7 Wall. 272; Hardinv. Jordan,
supra; Horne v. Smith, supra. The Fort Kearney reservation
was a single body of land, whose survey was directed by a
special act of Congress, anl there is nothing to show that in
making the survey there was any intentional wrong on' the
part of the surveyors. Evidently the survey of the entire
tract was completed before the lands, or any part of them,
were offered for sale. According to statements in the brief
of counsel for plaintiff in error as well as in the opinion of the

Secretary of the Interior in In re Christensen, 25 L. D. 413,

WHITAKER v. McBRIDE.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

there were several islands in the Platte River within the reservation not surveyed. The Secretary says that it does not
appear why the lines of survey were not extended over these
islands, but in the brief of counsel as well as in the opinion of
the Supreme Court it is stated that the instructions issued by
the Land Department to the surveyors were to survey all
islands of twenty-one acres and upwards. The reason of the
Department or of the surveyors (whichever may have been
responsible for the omission to survey these small islands) for
these omissions is not disclosed. Possibly they may have been
regarded as having no stability as tracts of land but as mere
sandbars, which are frequently found in Western waters, and
are of temporary duration, existing to-day and gone to-morrow.
Be that as it may, there is nothing to indicate any fraud or
mistake on the part of the surveyors. Doubtless this island
of about twenty-two acres was regarded as coming within
their instructions, and very likely at the time of the survey
did not contain even twenty-one acres. Further, an application for a survey of this island was refused, and this refusal
was repeated once or twice. The Secretary of the Interior
based his action on the decision of this court in Grand Rapids
& Indiana Railroad Company v. Butler, 159 U. S. 87, and held
that the Department was precluded from a survey and sale
of an island after the lands on the adjacent banks of the river
had been surveyed and sold. In the Grand Rapids case it
appeared that the land on the east bank of Grand River had
been surveyed in 1831, and that on the west bank of the river
in 1837, and also that included in this last survey were four
islands. Upon these surveys the adjacent land and the islands
were sold and patented to private parties. In 1855 a parcel
of ground in the river was, under instructions from the surveyor general, surveyed and marked "Island No. 5," and for
that island a patent was issued to the railroad company. We
held that the patent to the riparian owner issued before the
date of the last survey conveyed to him the title to the islanO
saying (p. 95):
VOL. cxcvii-33

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

197 U. S.

"We have no doubt upon the evidence that the circumstances were such at the time of the survey as naturally induced the surveyor to decline to survey this particular spot
as an island. There is nothing to indicate mistake or fraud,
and the Government has never taken any steps predicated
on such a theory; and did not survey the so called Island No. 5
until twenty-five years after the survey of 1831, and nearly
twenty years after that of 1837."
These considerations furnish a sufficient answer to the question and sustain the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska.
It is further contended that the land of one of these patentee's is itself part of an island, and that therefore he has no
riparian rights. It is sufficient reply to this contention that
the Government surveyed and patented the lands up to the
banks of the channel in which the island in controversy is
situated, and a patentee, although his land may be itself surrounded by two channels of the river, has all the rights of a
riparian owner in the channel lying opposite his banks.
Nothing herein stated conflicts with Home v. Smith, 'supra;
Niles v. Cedar Point Club, 175 U. S. 300; French-Glenn Live
Stock Company v. Springer, 185 V. S. 47, or Kirwan v. Murphy,
189 U. S. 35. In the first of those cases it appeared that the
survey stopped at a bayou and did not extend to the main
channel of Indian River, a mile distant, and we held that the
line of that bayou must be considered as the boundary of the
grant; that it could not be extended over the unsurveyed land
between the bayou and the main channel of Indian River;
that it was a case of an omission from the survey of land that
ought to have been surveyed, and that such omission did not
operate to transfer unsurveyed land to the patentee of the
surveyed land bordering on the bayou. In the second we held
that, as the survey showed a meander line bordering on a tract
of swamp or marsh lands, the grant by patent terminated at
the meander line and did not carry the swamp lands lying between it and the shores of Lake Erie. In the third, it appeared
that there was no body of water in front of the meandered line,

WHITAKER v. McBRIDE.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and we held that that line must, therefore, be the limit of the
grant, and the fact that outside the side lines extended there
was a body of water did not operate to extend the grant into
any portion of that body of water. In the last of these cases
the complainants, the owners of 859.38 acres as shown by the
descriptions in their patents of fractional lots, claimed by
reason thereof to be the owners of 1,202 acres lying between
the meandered lines and a lake, and sought by injunction to
restrain the Land Department from making a survey of these
latter lands. We held that injunction would not lie, and that
the officers of the Government could not be restrained from
making a survey; that the rights of the complainants could be
settled, after a survey and transfer of the legal title from the
Government, by an action at law.
It is suggested in one of the briefs that this island extends
up or down the river beyond the side lines of the tracts be-.
longing to these riparian proprietors. A plat which is in evidence seems to support this statement, but the finding of the
trial court, which is not disturbed by the Supreme Court, is to
the effect that it lies between the tracts of the riparian proprietors. Of course, their title'is only to the land which is in front
of their banks and not beyond the side lines in either direction.
It must also be noticed that the Government is not a party
to this litigation, and nothing we have said is to be construed
as a determination of the power of the Government to order
a survey of this island or of the rights which would result in
case it did make such survey. As we reserve the rights of the
United States we do not even impliedly sanction the intimation contained in the opinion of the court below that under
the decision in Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S.371, although, on
non-navigable waters, riparian rights were not conferred by
the state law, nevertheless the land beyond the banks passed
to the State in virtue of the patents of the United States to
the lot owners. Upon that question we express no opinion*
Our conclusion, therefore, is that by the law of Nebraska,
as interpreted by its highest court, the riparian proprietors are

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

the owners of the bed of a stream to the center of the channel;
that the Government, as original proprietor, has the right to
survey and sell any lands, including islands in a river or other
body of water; that if it omits to survey an island in a stream
and refuses, when its attention is called to the matter, to make
any survey thereof, no citizen can overrule the action of the
Department, assume that the island ought to have been surveyed, and proceed to occupy it for the purposes of homestead or preemption entry. In such a case the rights of
riparian proprietors are to be preferred to the claims of the
settler.
We see no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Nebraska, and it is
Affirmed.

RASSMUSSEN v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF ALASKA.
No. 51. Argued November 4,1904.-Decided April 10, 1905.

The treaty with Russia concerning Alaska, instead of exhibiting, as did
the treaty with Spain respecting the Philippine 'Islands, the determination to reserve the question of the status of the acquired territory for
ulterior action by Congress, manifested a contrary intention to admit
the inhabitants of the ceded territory to the enjoyment of citizenship,
and expressed the purpose to incorporate the territory into the United
States.
Under the treaty with Russia ceding Alaska and the subsequent legislation
of Congress, Alaska has been incorporated into the United States and
the Constitution is applicable to that Territory, and under the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments Congress cannot deprive one there accused of a misdemeanor of trial by a common law jury, and that § 171 of the Alaska
Code, 31 Stat. 358, in so far as it provides that in trials for misdemeanors six persons shall constitute a legal jury, is unconstitutional
and void.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.
