and locations as correctly marking the original banks of the
river and the mid(le of the old channel, the court will, by
decree, give effect to that agreement; or, if either State desires
a new survey, the court will order one to be made and will cause
monuments to be placed so as to permanently mark the
boundary lines between the two States. The disposition of
the case by final decree is postponed for forty days, in order
that the court may be advised as to the wishes of the parties
in respect to these details.'
"In pursuance whereof now come the parties hereto by their
respective counsel and agree that the said surveys made by
the county surveyors of Nemaha County, Nebraska, and Atchison County, Missouri, as reported by the Commissioners and
set forth in the opinion of the court, constitute and be correct
boundary lines between the said States, the same constituting
the middle of the old channel of Missouri River as found by
said court in its opinion.
"It is further agreed between the parties hereto that the
monuments marking said boundary line established by the said
county surveyors of said counties are not of a permanent
character, and many of them have become destroyed or removed, and that in order to mark a permanent boundary line
it is necessary and is deemed best that permanent monuments be erected at regular intervals on said line in such
manner as will quiet all dispute in reference to said boundary.
"It is further agreed that said permanent monuments can
be best established under the supervision of the Commissioner's
heretofore appointed by the court, to wit; Alfred Hazlett and
John W. Halliburton, and it is therefore requested by the
parties to this cause that the court, by a proper order, direct
and require said Commissioners to establish or cause to be
established under their direction such permanent monuments
as may by them be deemed necessary in the premises and in
accordance with the order of the court heretofore made, and
make a report to the court of their acts and doings therein.
In the execution of their powers herein said Commissioners

MISSOURI v. N EIRASK A.

Decree.

shall have authority to employ such surveyors and other
assistants and procure such material as may be necessary in
the establishment of the permanent monuments, marking said
boundary line in accordance with the opinion of the court
heretofore rendered and this agreement.
"It is further agreed that said Commissioners for their
services herein shall receive such compensation as may be
agreed upon by the respective parties, and if the parties are
unable to agree, then such as may be fixed by the court after
the services have been performed and due report thereon made.
"On account of the unfavorable condition of the weather
during the winter months and of the character of the ground
during the spring months, the parties hereto respectfully request the court that said Commissioners be granted until the
first day of May, 1905, in which to make their report.

And on motion of Herbert S. Hadley, Attorney General of
the State of Missouri, counsel for said complainant, that a decree be entered in this cause in accordance with said opinion and
stipulation:
It is now here ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court
that the middle of the channel of the Missouri River, according to its course as it was prior to the avulsion of July 5, 1867,
