CARTER v. GEAR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF HAWAII.
No. 442. Submitted March 3, 1905.-Decided April 3, 1905.

The statutes of 1892 of the Territory of Hawaii purporting to confer upon
the judges of the several courts, at chambers, within their respective
jurisdictions, judicial power not incident or ancillary to some cause pending before a court, are not in conflict with ยง 81 of the Organic Act of the
Territory, approved April 30, 1900, 31 Stat. 141, 157, and the'power of
the judges to act at chambers was expressly saved by the provision in
ยง 81 continuing the law of Hawaii theretofore in force concerning courts
and their jurisdiction until the legislature otherwise ordered, except as
otherwise provided in the Organic Act.
In construing the organic act of a Territory the whole act must be considered in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the intention of
Congress, and no single section should be segregated and given undue
prominence where other sections bear upon the same subject. Whether
a petition in a probate proceeding to a court acting as a probate court
shall be addressed to, and passed upon by the judge, while sitting in
court or at (hambers is more a matter of form than of substance.

THIS was a writ of error to review a judgment of the Supreme

Court of the Territory of Hawaii denying a writ of prohibition.
The facts of the case are substantially as follows: On July 27,
1904, one Low, -as next friend of Annie T. K. Parker, a minor,
filed a petition before the defendant, George D. Gear, judge
of the First Judicial Circuit, in probate, at chambers, asking
for the removal of Alfred W. Carter, plaintiff in, error, as
guardian of the estate of said minor. He had been originally

Argumen4 for Plaintiff in Error.

appointed such guardian September 29, 1899.- The petition
was entitled "In the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit,
Territory of Hawaii. In Probate. At Chambers," and was
in fact filed before the Circuit Judge sitting at chambers. A
demurrer was interposed to the petition upon the ground that
the Circuit Judge had no jurisdiction of the proceedings, for
the reason that the statute conferring judicial powers upon
the judges at chambers was in conflict with the Organic Act
of the Territory.
The demurrer was overruled and the jurisdiction of the
court sustained, apparently with some doubt, by the Circuit
Judge.
This petition for a writ of prohibition was then filed by
Carter in the Supreme Court of the Territory against the defendant,. Gear, as Circuit Judge, and Low, the next friend of
Annie T. K. Parker, praying that the said Circuit Judge be
prohibited from taking further cognizance of the petition for
the removal of Carter, or proceeding therein until the further
order of the Supreme Court. After a full hearing the Supreme
Court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, and dismissed the petition.
Mr. Joseph J. Darlington and Mr. William F. Mattingly
for plaintiff in error:
The statutes of the Territory of Hawaii, purporting to confer
jurisdiction upon circuit judges at chambers, to hear and
determine judicial matters not incident or ancillary to a cause
pending in any court, are null and void, being in contravention
with ยง81 of the Organic Act of the Territory of Hawaii. See
decisions under similar constitutional provisions.
Section 81 is practically identical with the constitutional
provisions of many States, and under these constitutional
provisions similar statutes, purporting to confer upon circuit
judges at chambers, judicial power not incident or ancillary
to a cause pending in any court, have invariably been de-

clared unconstitutional.

Under ยง 83 of the Organic Act the laws of Hawaii relative
to the judiciary act, except as amended by the Organic Act
itself, are continued in force. The entire act must be considered in construing it.
Independently of the construction which has been placed
upon the words "in chambers" in Hawaii, the words "Circuit
Courts" mean the courts referred to in the expression "in
chambers." Wilcox v. Wilcox, 14 N. Y. 577,; Presley v. Lamb,

The cases cited by plaintiff in error in opposition to this
are controlled by their own peculiar circumstances and do not
apply.
It could not have been the intention of Congress to deprive
us of a chambers jurisdiction, as provided in our civil laws.
Such an intention would be violative of our constitutional
guaranty of due process of law. The fact that all the other
jurisdictional statutes were specifically repealed makes it
conclusive that no such intention existed. There would be
anarchy in case the courts of equity and probate were divested
of their power. Such an intention would violate the Constitution. See Brannon, Fourteenth Amendment, 1, 64, 97, 147,

MR. JUSTICE BROWN, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The writ of prohibition was demanded upon the ground that
there was no cause pending in the Circuit Court of the First
Circuit, to which the motion and petition of Low, as next
friend, was incidental or ancillary, and that Judge Gear,
sitting at chambers, was hearing questions of a judicial nature
entirely independent of any cause pending in that court.
The single question presented by the record is whether the
statutes of the Territory of Hawaii, purpor'lng to confer upon
the judges of the several courts, at chambers, within their
respective jurisdictions, ju(licial power not incident or ancillary to some cause pending before a court, were in conflict
with eection 81 of the act of Congress approved April 30, 1900,

CARTER v. GEAR.
197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

31 Stat. 141, commonly known as the Organic Act of the Territory. This section, page 157, enacts that "the judicial power
of the Territory shall be vested in one supreme court, circuit
courts, and in such inferior courts as the legislature may from
time to time establish. And until the legislature shall otherwise provide, the laws of Hawaii heretofore in force concerning
the several courts and their jurisdiction and procedure shall
continue in force except as herein otherwise provided."
At the time the act of Congress was passed there was in
force in the Territory of Hawaii an act known as Chapter 57
of the Laws of 1892, the thirty-seventh section of which gave
to the judges of the several Circuit Courts, at chambers, very
ample powers, in admiralty, equity, bankruptcy and probate
causes, among which were proceedings "to remove any executor, administrator or guardian." This act was conceded to
be sufficient to justify the action of Judge Gear in removing
the guardian in this case. It was substantially rcnacted
with amendments in 1903.
The argument is made that section 81 of the Organic Act
is identical with the constitutional provisions of many States,
under which similar statutes purporting to confer judicial
powers upon Circuit Judges at chambers, not incident to or
ancillary to any cause pending in any court, have usually been
declared unconstitutional; citing Spencer Creek Water Co. v.
Vallejo, 48 California, 70; Risser v. Hoyt, 53 Michigan, 185;
Toledo Ry. Co. v. Dunlap, 47 Michigan, 456; Rowe v. Rowe,
28 Michigan, 353; Pittsburg &c. R. R. Co. v. Hurd, 17 Ohio St.
144, 146; State v. Woodson, 161 Missouri, 444.

We are also

referred to McKnight v. James, 155 U. S. 685, in which we
held that a writ of error could not go to an order of a judge
of a Circuit Court made at chambers.
But conceding the correctness of these decisions under the
constitutions of the several States, and also conceding that
the Organic Act stands in the place of a constitution for the
Territory of Hawaii, to which its laws must conform, does
it follow that the laws respecting proceedings at chambers

are in excess of the powers conferred under the Organic
Act?
Bearing in mind that section 81 of the Organic Act is but
one of a hundred sections, all of which are entitled to equal
respect, it is evident that to obtain a comprehensive view of
the intention of Congress we are bound to consider the whole
act so far as it relates to the disposition of judicial power.
To segregate section 81 from all the other provisions of the
act must necessarily result in giving it undue prominence.
By section 6, " the laws of Hawaii not inconsistent with the
Constitution and laws of the United States or the provisions
of this act shall continue in force, subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature of Hawaii, or the Congress of the United
States." By section 7 the constitution of the Republic of
Hawaii and a large number of its laws, specially enumerated,
are repealed, but the statutes giving probate and equity jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts are not mentioned.
By section 10 all actions at law, suits in equity and other
proceedings then pending in the courts of the Republic of
Hawaii shall be carried on to final judgment-and execution
in the corresponding courts of the Territory of Hawaii. As
petitioner Carter was appointed guardian of the minor's estate
in 1899. by the then judge of the First Circuit, and was still
proceeding to wind up the estate, we think the petition for his
removal was filed in a pending proceeding within the meaning
of this section.
Now,. as it appears. that the 'powers of judges at chambers
had been fixed since 1892, eight yearsbefore the Organic Act
was passed, that by section 6 and the final clause of section 81
the laws of Hawaii theretofore in force concerning the several
courts and their jurisdiction and procedure were continued in
force, except as therein otherwise provided, it would seem that
these provisions were especially intended to apply to cases like
the present, where a system of procedure which had previously
existed was recognized as valid and still existing. In Hawaii
v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197, a similar provision in the resolu-

tion of annexation was held not to abrogate a system of trials
by information and convictions by a non-unanimous jury, as
applied to cases prior to the Organic Act of April 30, 1900.
But we do not think it necessary to go further than section 81 itself to find authority for a recognition of the laws
previously existing in Hawaii concerning the constitution of
its courts and their method of procedure. Whether a )etition
to a Circuit Court acting as a court of probate shall be addressed
to and passed upon by the judge while sitting in court at
chambers is, after all, much more a matter of form than of
substance. Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 122 Massachusetts,
449. The petition for the removal of the guardian in this case
is entitled "In the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit,
Territory of Hawaii. In Probate. At Chambers." It appears to have been heard by the Circuit Judge without a jury,
his decision being entitled "Before a Judge of the Circuit
Court, of the First Circuit, Territory of Hawaii." It must
doubtless be treated as a proceeding at chambers, but for
reasons already given we think the power to act at chambei's
was saved by section 81 continuing in force the previous laws
of Hawaii concerning the courts and their procedure. It
would be too narrow a construction to hold that this did not
include the procedure before judges of those courts sitting at
chambers.
The decree dismissing the writ is
Affirmed.
