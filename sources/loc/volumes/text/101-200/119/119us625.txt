APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
Argued December 6, 1886.-Decided January 10, 1837.

A fixed structure, contrived for the purpose of taking ships out of the
water in order to repair them, and for no other purpose, consisting of a
large oblong box, with a flat bottom and perpendicular sides, with no
means of propulsion either by wind, steam, or otherwise, and not designed for navigation, but only as a floating dry-dock, permanently
moored, is not a subject of salvage service-

This was an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court dismissing a libel for salvage for want of jurisdiction. The case
is stated in the opinion of the court.'

JUSTI E BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a libel for salvage filed in the District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana by the owners of the steam-tug
,Col. L. Aspinwall, her master and crew, and the owner of the
stear-tug Joseph Cooper, and her crew, against the Vallette
Dry Dock Company of New Orleans, to recover salvage forsalving the company's dry-dock at Algiers, opposite INew
Orleans, from sinking and becoming a total loss. According

Opinion of the Court.

to the allegations of the libel, the said dry-dock was run into
by the steamship Clintonia, which did not obey her helm, and
by the frce of the collision a large hole was broken into the
side of the dock, extending below the water-line, and it began
to fill with water, and commenced sinking, and would have
sunk but for the exertions of the libellants, who hastened to
its relief and applied their suction pumps in pumping out the'
water with which it was being filled, and thus at large expense
and much trouble saved her from destruction. The libel
alleges that the Yallette dry-dock is a large floating vessel
and water-craft and artificial contrivance, used and capable of
being used as a means of transportation in water, and was of
great value, having cost upwards of $200,000, and was largely
and profitably engaged in the business of docking vessels for
repairs in the Mississippi River, and the libellants claim that
their services were of the greatest merit, deserving a reward
of at least $5000.
The respondents pleaded, first, res judicat, alleging that a
similar libel for the same cause had been formerly filed in the
same court and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. This plea
was overruled. Their second plea was to the effect that the
case is not one of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; that
the assistance rendered by the libellants to the dry-dock was
not a salvage service; that the dhy-dock is not devoted to the
purpose of transportation and conunerce, nor intended for
navigation; that it is nothing more than pieces of lumber fastened together and placed upon the water to receive vessels
for repair, and having engines used, not for the purpose of
locomotion from one place to another, (of which, by its own
resources, it is incapable,) but solely to lower and elevate said
dock, in order to receive vessels for repair; that it was always
solely employed in the business of docking and repairing vessels; that at the time of the alleged salvage services it was
moored and lying at its usual place where it had been located
ever since the year 1866. Proofs being taken, the District
Court dismissed the libel upon the plea to the jurisdiction;
and on appeal to the Circuit Court, the same decree was
nmde.

COPE v. VALLETTE DRY DOCK CO.
Opinion of the Court.

The facts found by the Circuit Court substantially corroborate the plea. They describ6 the dry-dock as a structure contrived for the purpose of taking. ships out of the water, in
order to repair them, and for no other purpose. They state
that it consisted of a large oblong box, with a flat bottom and
perpendicular sides; that in the year 1866 it had been put in
position by being permanently moored by means of large
chains to the right, or Algiers, bank of the Mississippi River,
and was -sparred off from the bank by means of spars, to keep
it afloat. When it was desired to dock a steamboat or other
vessel, it was sunk by letting in water until the vessel to be
(locked could be floated into it. It was then raised by pumnping the water out, leaving the docked vessel in a position to
be inspected and repaired. It was furnished with engines, but
they could only be used for pumping, and the dry-dock had
no means of propulsion, either by wind, steam, or otherwise.
It was not designed for navigation, and could not be practically used therefor. The circumstances of the collision and
rescue were substantially as stated in the libel. As a conclusion of law, the Circuit Court found that the services of the
libellants were not salvage services, and that neither that
court nor the District Court had jurisdiction of the case.
We have no hesitation in saying that the decree of the Circuit Court was right. A fixed structure, such as this dry-dock
is, not used for the purpose of nhvigation, is not a subject of
salvage service, any more than is a wharf or a warchouse
when projecting into or upon the water. The fact that it
floats on the water does not make it a ship or vessel, and no
structure that is not a ship or vessel is a subject of salvage.
A ferry bridge is genertilly a floating structure, hinged or
chained toa wharf. This might be the subject of salvage as
well as a dry-dock. A sailor's floating bethel, oi' meetinghouse moored to a wharf, and kept in place by a paling of
surrounding piles, is in the same category. It can hardly be
contended that such a structure is susceptible of salvage service. A ship or vessel, used for navigation and c nmerce,
though lying at a wharf, and temporarily made fast thereto,
as well as her furniture and cargo, are maritime subjects, and

Scotland, ยง 638, 7th Ed.; Tb., Principles of Laws of Scotland, 7th
Ed. ยง 443. "Salvage," says Kent, "is the compensation allowed to
persons by whose assistance a ship or its cargo has been saved
in whole or in part from impending danger, or recovered from
actual loss, in cases of shipwreck, derelict, or recapture." 3
Kent, 245. Lord Tenderden defines it as "the compensation
that is to be made to other persons by whose assistance a
ship or its lading may be saved from impending peril, or recovered after actual loss." Abbott on Shipping, 554. Sir
Christopher Robinson defines salvage as follows: "Salvage, in
its simple character, is the service which those who recover
property from loss or danger at sea render to the owners,
with the responsibility of making restitution, and with a lien
for their reward." The Tetis, 3 Hagg. Adm. 14, 48. This
definition is adopted by Machlachlan, in his Treatise on Merchant Shipping, Chap. XIII. 523. [2d Ed., page 569.] Sir
John Nichol, in TYe Clffton, 3 Hlagg. Adm. 117, 120, says:
Now, salvage is not always a mere compensation for work
and labor; various circumstances upon public considerations,
the interests of commerce, the benefit and security of navigation, the lives of the seamen, render it proper to estinate a
salvage reward upon a more enlarged and liberal scale. The
ingredients of a salvage service are, first, enterprise in the salvors in going out in tempestuous weather to assist a vessel in
distress, risking their own lives to save their fellow-creatures,
and to rescue the property of their "fellow-subjects; secondly,
the degree of danger and distress from which the property is
rescued -whether it were in imminent peril, and almost certain to be lost if not at the time rescued and preserved;
thirdly, the degree of labor and skill which the salvors incur
and display, and the time occupied. Lastly, the value.
Where all these circumstances concur, a large and liberal
reward ought to be given; but where none, or scarcely any
take place, the compensation can hardly be denominated a

salvage compensation; it is little more than a remuneration
pj'o opere et labore."
If we search through all the books, from the Rules of
Oleron to the present time, we shall find that salvage is only
spoken of in relation to ships and vessels and their cargoes, or
those things which have been committed to, or lost in, the sea
or its branches, or other public navigable waters, and have
been found and rescued.
It is true that the terms "ships" and "vessels" are used in a
very broad sense, to include all navigable structures intended
for transportation. In a recent case decided by the Court of
Appeal, in England, which arose upon that part of the Merchant Shipping Act, 17 and 18 Vict. c. 104, ยง 458, giving jurisdiction to justices of the peace in certain cases of salvagej
"Whenever any ship or boat is stranded, or otherwise in distress, on the shore of any sea or tidal water situate within the
limits of the United Kingdom" it was held (overruling Sir
Robert Phillimore) that the word "ship" would include a
hopper-barge used for receiving mud from a dredging-machine
and carrying it out to deep water, though it had no means of
locomotion of its own, but was towed by other vessels; it had
a bow, stern and rudder, and was steerable. Lord Justice
Brett said: "The words ' ship' and ' boat ' are used; but it
seems plain to me that the word 'ship' is not used in the
technical sense as denoting a vessel of a particular rig. In
popular language, ships are of different kinds; barques, brigs,
schooners, sloops, cutters. The word includes anything floating in or upon the water, built in a particular form, and used
for a particular purpose. In this case the vessel, if she may
be so called, was built for a particular purpose; she was built
as a hopper-barge; she has no motive power, no means of
progression within herself. Towing alone will not conduct
her; she must have a rudder; and, therefore, she must have
men on board to steer her. Barges are. vessels in a certain
sense; and, as the word 'ship' is not used in a strictly nautical meaning, but is used in a popular meaning, I think that
this hopper-barge is a 'ship.' . . . This hopper-barge is
used for carrying men and mud; she is used in navigation;
for to dredge up and carry away mud and gravel is an act

done for the purposes of navigation. Suppose that a saloon.
barie, capable of carrying 200 persons, is towed down the
river Mersey in order to put passengers on board of vessels
lying at its mouth; she would be used for the purposes of
navigation, and I think it equally true that the hopper-barge
was used in navigation." The .Jfac, 7 P. D. 126, 130; overruling S. C. lb. 38.
Perhaps this case goes as far as any case has gone in extending the meaning of the terms "ship" or " vessel." Still,
the hopper-barge was a navigable structure used for the purpose of transportation. We think no case can be found
which would construe the terms to include a dry-dock, a
floating-bridge, or meeting-house, permanently moored or
attached to a wharf.
There has been some conflict of decision with respect to
claims for salvage services in rescuing goods lost at sea and
found floating on the surface or cast upon the shore. When
they have belonged to a ship or vessel as part of its furniture
or cargo they clearly come under the head of wreck, flotsam,
jetsam, ligan, or derelict, and salvage may be claimed upon
them. But when they have no connection with a ship or vessel some authorities are against the claim, and others are in
favor of it. Decisions in favor of the claim in reference to
rafts of timber found floating at sea were made by Judge
]3etts in the New York District, A Raft of Aars, 1 Abbott's
Adm. 485, and by Judge Lowell in the Massachusetts District,
50,000 Feet of Timber, 2 Lowell, 64, and against it by Chief
Justice Taney in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, Tome v. 4 Cribs of Iumber, Taney's Dec.
65'&3, and by the English Court of Excheqiier, in Palrmer v.
louse, 3 H. & N. 505. Perhaps the decisions in the last two
cases were affected by local custom or statutory provisions.
None of these cases, however, throw any light on the subject
in hand. The case of Salvor TVreoking Co. v. Sectional .Dock
Comrpany, reported in 3 Central Law Journal, 640, and the
note appended the -eto, may be referred to for an interesting
discussion of the question. Judge Dillon, in that case, held
that a dry-dock is not a subject of salvage service.
Tle judgment of thte Circuit Court is aifrmed.
