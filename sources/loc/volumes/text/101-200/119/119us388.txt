case here on the affidavits, free from any decision whatever by
the court below as to their effect. In this respect the case
diffeis -from Gage v. Pumpelly, 108 U. S. 164, where the appeal was allowed by the court in session after considering the
affidavits; and from Zeigler v. Hokins, 117 U. S. 683, where
the value was found as one of the facts in the case.
The burden of showing jurisdiction is on the plaintiff in
error. He must establish as a fact by a fair preponderance of
testimony that the value of the property in dispute exceeds
five thousand dollars. This he has not done. Two witnesses
swear that the property is worth more than six thousand dollars, and eight that it is worth five thousand dollars, "or
more." These are for the plaintiff 'in error, but there are
eight on the other side who say it is worth only from about
•$3000 to about $3500, and the certificate of the county clerk
shows that it was valued for taxation in 1884 at only seven
hundred dollars. Under these circums tances, we think the
decided preponderance of the evidence is against our jurisdicion, and the motion to dismiss is therefore granted.

JOHNSON v. CHICAGO AND PACIFIC ELEVATOR
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
Argued November 30, 1886.-Decided December 13, 1836.

The jib-boom of a vessel towed by a steam-tug, in the Chicago River, at Chi_
cago, Illinois, struck a building on land, through the negligence of the tug,
and caused damagetoit, and the losg of shelled corn stored in it. A statute
of Illinois gave a lien on the tug for the ddmage, to be enforced by a suit
in personam against her owner, with an attachment against the tug, and a
judgment in personam against her owner and the surety in a 6b5nd for
her release. In such a suit, in a court of Illinois, to recover such damage, such a bond having been given, conditioned to pay any judgment in
the suit, and the tug having been released, an application afterwards by
J., claiming to be part o'iner of her, to be made a defendant in the suit,
was denied, and a judgment for the damage was given against the de-

fendant and the surety in the bond, without personal notice to the latter,
which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois. On a writ of error
from this c6urt: Held,
(1) The cause of action was not a maritime tort of which an Admiralty
Court of the United States would have jurisdiction;
(2) The State could create the lien afid enact rules to enforce it, not
amounting to a regulation of commerce, or to an admiralty proceeding,
in ren, or otherwise in conflict with the Constitution of the United
States;
(3) The actual proceeding in this case was a suit in personam, with an
attachment to enforce the lien, and was not forbidden by that Constitution;
(4) The provision of subdivision 6, of § 9, of article 1, of the Cdnstitution
of the United States, in regard to giving a preference to the ports of
one State over those of another, is not a limitation on the power of a
State;
(5) The judgment against the surety was proper, as the statute provided
for it, and formed part of the bond;
(6) J. was not unlawfully denied a hearing, because he did not apply to be
made a defendant until after the tug was discharged.

On the 22d of September, 1881, the Chicago & Pacific Elevator Company, an Illinois corporation, filed a petition in the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, setting forth that, on
the 29th of August, 1881, it was the proprietor of a warehouse
on the land, in Cook County, near the bank of the Chicago
River, which had stored in it a quantity of shelled corn; that
on that day Jacob Johnson, a resident of Chicago, in said
county, was the owner of the tug:boat Parker, of above five
tons burtheir, used and intended to be used in navigating the
waters and the canals of Illinois, and having its home port in
Illinois; that the Parker, on that day, was towing a schooner,
attached to her by a hawser, in the Chicago River, in said
cbunty, the schooner being under the control of the officers of
the tug; and that the tug and the schooner were so negligently managed, and the schooner was so negligently towed, by those having control of the tug, that the jib-boom of the
schooner went through the wall of the warehouse, whereby a
large quantity of the corn ran out and~was lost in the river,
causing a damage of $394.38 to the petitioner. The petition
pray'ed for a writ of attachment agai*it Johnson, to be issued
to the sheriff, commanding him to attach the tug and to sum-

mon the defendant to appear, and for a decree subjecting the
tug to a lien, for such damages.
On the giving of the-required bond on behalf of the petitioner, a writ of attachment was issued on the same day to
the sheriff,'commanding him to attach the tug and to summon
Johnson to appear on the 17th of October. The return of the
sheriff stated. that he-.had attached ar the right, title; and
'interest of Johnson in and to the tug, and had served the writ
on Johnson personally, on the same day.
A bond was given on the same day, executed by Johnson,
as owner of the tug, as principal, and Henry A. Chrisfy, as
.surety, conditioned to pay all money which should be adjudged
by the court in the suit to be due to the petitioner. Thereupon a writ was issued to the sheriff, cdmmanding him to
return the attached property to Johnson, which was done.
On the 17th of October, Johnson filed a paper called a
"demurrer and exceptions," setting up, among. other things,
that the court had no jurisdiction to create or enforce a lien
on the tug. On the 21st of October, the plaintiff entered a
motion that the default of the defendant be taken for want of
an affidavit of merits. On October 31st, after the denial of a
motion by the defendant for leave to file an affidavit of merits,
the court entered of record the default of -the defendant for
the want of such an affidavit, and a judgment "that the plaintiff ought to recover of the defendant its damages by reason of
the, premises." At the same time the defendant entered a
motion to vaoate the default, insisting on the want of jurisdiction in the court.
On the same day, James B. Carter, alleging that he was,
when the attachment was levied, and still continued to be, a
,part owner of the tug, filed a motion that he be made a de'fendant, and be permitted to defend against the petition.
On the 5th of November, the motion of Johnson to vacate
the default against him was overruled; and the motion of Carter was denied. Thereupon -Johnson filed a motion to dismiss
the petition for want of jurisdiction in the court to enforce the
lien claimed, because the tug was a steam vessel of above 20
tons burthen, duly enrolled and licensed in conformity to Title

gaged in the business of domestic commerce and navigation
on the navigable waters of the United States, and that exclusive jurisdiction to enforce a lien in r6e on the tug was in
the District Courts of the United States. This motion was
denied.
Proper bills of exceptions were allowed to the foregoing
rulings.
On the 30th of January, 1882, the damages were assessed
by a jury at $300; and a judgment was entered in favor of the
,plaintiff against Johnson and Christy, for $300 and costs, on"
the lth of February, 1882. They excepted, and they and
Carter appealed to the Appellate Court for the First District
of Illinois. That court, in July, 1882, affirmed the:judgment of
the Circuit Court of Cook County, and an appeal was taken
by the same parties to the Supreme Court of Illinois. Among
the assignments of error in that court were these: That Carter
was not allowed to defend; that the judgment was entered
against Christy without notice or process; that the inferior
courts had no jurisdiction to enforce the lien on a vess&F engaged in domestic commerce between the States; that the
statute of Illinois violated. the Constitution of the United
States; and that the exclusive jurisdiction in the premises
was in a coirt of the United States.
The statute under whiich the proceedings in this suit took
place is c. 12 of the* Revised Statutes of Illinois, entitled
"Attachment of Water Craft," which went into effect July 1st,
1874. Rev. Stat. Ill 1881, p. 159. The act, § 1, gives a lien on
all water craft of above five tons burtheh, " u sed or intended

The rendition of judgmaent against Christy without suit,

to th6 Constitution. So was the denial to Carter, part owner
of the vessel, of the right to interplead and to defend his
property.
The provisions of the Illinois statute amount to a regulation
of commerce, inasmuch as they give to the ports of Illinois an
Admiralty proceeding under State law, enforceable in its courts
alone. It violates the provision of the Constitution that "no
preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce to
the ports of one State over those of another," and the settled
principle that the Federal Courts have jurisdiction in Admiralty of all cases of maritime liens.

BLATCHFOrD,

after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
It is assig.ed here for error (1) that the State Court had no
jurisdiction to enforce a lien in rem on a vessel above 20 tons
burthen, engaged in domestic commerce among the States, and
duly enrolled and licensed in conformity with Title 50 of the
Revised Statutes; (2) that the State statute is repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States, because it purports to give

Opinion of the Court.

to a State Court admiralty jurisdiction to enforce a maritime
lien n 'em; (3) that judgment was given against Christy without notice to him or due process of law; (4) that Carter, a part
owner of the tug, was denied a hearing.
Under the decisions of this court in The Plymouth, 3 Wall.
20, and in .Exprte Pkenix Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610, at the
present term, it must be held that the cause of' action in this
case was not a maritine tort of which a District Court of the
United States, as a court of admiralty, would have. jurisdiction; and that the remedy belonged wholly to a court of
common law; the substance and consummation of the wrong
having ta l m place on land, and not on navigablk water, and
the cause of action not having been complete on such water.
This being so, tio reason exists why the remedy for the wrong
should not be pursued in the State Court, 'according to the
statutory method prescribed by the law of the State, even
thoilgh that law gives a lien on the vessel The cases in which
State statutes have been held void by this court, to the extent
in which they autholized suits in rem against vessels, because
they gave to the State Courts admiralty jurisdiction, were only
cases where the causes of action were cognizable in the admiralty. INecessarily, no other- cases could be embraced. Th8

In the present case, the suit is a suit inpersonam. The petition states that the plaintiff "complains of Jacob Johnson,"
"and makes him. defendant herein;" and that the plaintiff
has demanded the amount of his damage from the defendant,
but the latter refuses to pay it. The petition prays that the
tug may be attached and the defendant be summoned. -The
writ of attachment recites that the plaintiff has complained
that Johnson is indebted to it in $394.38, for which .it claims
a lien on the tug. The writ commands the sheriff to attach
the tug and to summon Johnson to appear before the court on
a day named. Attachment was made of "all the right, title,
and interest" of Johnson in and to the tug, and at the same
time the writ was served on him by being read to him. The
releasing bond executed by Johnson and Christy recites the

Opinion of the Court.

action as being one for da -magesalleged to be due to the plaintiff from Johnson. From the time of the issuing of the writ of
restitution, on the same day the petition was filed, the tug disappears from the proceedings, the bond having taken her place.
The judgment was one in personam against Johnson and
Christy, as required by § 21 of the statute, in a case where the
,attached vessel has been discharged from custody. That section also provides that the proceedings subsequent to the judgment "shall be the same as now provided by law in personal
actions in the Courts of record in this State."
So far, therefore, as this suit is concerned, the action, in the
shape in which it comes before this court, is a suit inpersonam,
with an attachment as security, the attachment being based
on, a lien given by the State statute, and a bond having been,
by the act of the defendant, substituted for the thing attached.
In Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, this court upheld the
validity of the seizure of a vessel under a process of foreign
attachment issuing from a State Court of Pennsylvania, in
pursuance of a statute of that State, as against a subsequent
attempt to seize her under process in admiralty. In the course
of the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Campbell, it is said: "The process of foreign attachment hasLbeen
for a long time in use hi Pennsylvania, and its operation is
well defined, by statute as well as judicial precedents.
The habit of courts of common law has been to deal with
ships as personal property, subject in the main, like other personal property, to municipal authority, and liable to their remedial process of attachment and execution, and the titles to
them, or contracts and torts relating to them, are cognizable
in those courts."
The subsequent case of Leon v. Galeeran, 11 Wall. 185, is
very much like the one now before us. There, by a statute of
Louisiana, a -mariner had a lien or privilege on his vessel ior
his wages, and he brought a suit in persocnm therefor in a
court, of the State, and had the vessel sequestered. She was released on a bond given by her owner, and by Leon as surety,
for the return of the vessel on final judgment. Judgment
being rendered against the owner inpersonam, and the vessel

JOHNSON v.- CHICAGO, &c.,' ELEVATOR CO.

399

Opinion ol the Court.

not being returned, the Mariner sued the surety, on the bond,
in the same court, and had judgment for the amount fixed by
the original judgment. On a writof error from this court, sued
out by Leon, it was urged for him, that, under the authority of
The -Moses Taylor and The Hine v. Trevor, the State Court
had no jurisdiction to enforce the lien by a seizure lefore judgment. On the other side, it was urged that the suit was a
c6mmon law remedy, within the clause in § 9 of the Judiciary
Act of September 24th, 1789, 1 Stat. 77, (now embodied in § 711,
subdivision 3, of the Revised Statutes,) which, after granting
to the District Courts of the United States "exclusive original
cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime juris
diction," saves "to suitors, in all cases, the right, of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give
it." This court held, that the action in personamr in the State
Court was a proper one, because it was a common law remedy,
which the common law was competent to. give, although the
State'law gave a lien on the vessel in the case, similar to a lion
under the maritime law, and it was made enforceable by a
writ of sequestration in advance, to hold the vessel as a secrity to respond to a judgment, if recovered against her owner,
as a defendant; that the, suit was not a proceeding in rera,nor
was the writ of sequestration; that the bond given on the release of the vessel became the substitute for her; that the common law is as competent as the admiralty to give a remedy in
all cases wjhere the suit is m"personall against the owner of
the property;, and that these views were not inconsistent with
any expressed in The Mfose Taylor, in The Hine v. Trevor, or
in ThTe Belfa.t.
The case of Petywit v.. Eaton, 15-Wall. 382, isa similar
one.
There being no lien on the tug, by the maritime law, for
the injury on land inflicted in tlts case, the State could create
such a lien therefor as it deemed expedient, and could enact
reasonable rules for its enforcement, not amounting to a, regulation of commerce. Liens under State statutes, enforceabie
by attachment, in suits in personain,are of every day occurrence, and may even extend to liens on vessels, when the pro-

Opinion of the Court.

ceedings to enforce them do not amount to admiralty proceedings in rem, or otherwise conflict with the Constitution of
the United States. There is no more valid objection to the
attachment proceeding to enforce the lien in a suit in 2ersonam, by holding the vessel by mesne process to be subjected
to execution on the personal judgment when recovered, than
-there is in subjecting her to seizure on the execution. Both
are incidents of a common law remedy, which a court of common law is competent to give. This disposes of the objection
that, the vessel being engaged in commerce among the States,
and enrolled and licensed therefor, no lien on her could be enforced by attachment in the State Court. The proceeding to
enforce the lien, in this case, was not such a regulation of commerce among the States as to be invalid, because an interference
with the exclusive authority of Congress to regulate such commerce, any more than regulations by a State of the rates of
wharfage for vessels, and of remedies to recover wharfage, not
amounting to a duty of tonnage, are such an interference,
because the vessels are engaged in inter-State commerce.
Cannon v. Jew Orleans, 20 Wall. 577, 582; Packet Co. v.
Catletsburg,105 U. S. 559; Transportation Co. v. Par ersburg, 107 U. S. 691.
Nor is the act of Illinois, so far as this case is concerned,
obnoxious to the objection that it is a regulation of commerce
which gives preference to the ports of Illinois over those of
another State, within the inhibition of subdivision 6 of § 9 of
Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. As was
said in XAfunn v. Pllinois, 94 U. S. 113, 135, "this provision
operates only as a limitation of the powers of Congress, and
in no respect affects the States in the regulation of their domestic affairs." See, also, .forgaw v. Louisiana, 118 U. S.
455, 467.
Whether proceedings under the Illinois statute, different from
those had in this case, may or may not be obnoxious to some
of the objections raised, is a question which must be left to be
determined when it properly arises.
As to the objection made by Christy to the judgment
against him, the Supreme Court of Illinois overruled it on the
