APPEAL

FROM'I

THE CIRCUIT COURT 'OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 602. Argued and submitted October 17, 1894.-

Decided October 29, 1894.

Whether an offence described in an indictment in a state court is an offence
against the laws of that State and punishable thereunder, or whether it is
made by Federal statutes an offence against the United States, exclusively cognizable by their courts, and whether the same act may be an
offence against both national and state governments, punishable in the
tribunals of each, without infringing upon the constitutional, guaranty
against being twice put in jeopardy of limb for the same offence, are
questions which a state court of original jurisdiction is competent to
decide in the first instance; and, (its obligation to rexider such decision as
-will give full effect to the supreme law of the land, and protect any right
secured by it to the accused, being the same that rests upon the courts of

the United States,) the latter, if applied to for a writ of habeas comus in

such case, should decline to issue it unless it also appears that the case is
one of urgency.
ExparteRoyall, 117 U. S. 241, followed, and distinguished from In re Loney,
134 U. S. 372.
The proper time, in such case, to invoke the jurisdiction of this court is
after the claim of the accused of immunity from prosecution in the state
court has been passed upon by the highest court of the State adversely
to him.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

.Mr. George Bliss fbr appellee.
MR. JUSTICE HARLA

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellee presented to the court below his petition for a
wvit of habeas corpus, alleging that he was restrained of his
liberty by the warden of the city prison in New York city;
that he had not been committed and was not detained by
virtue of any judgnment, decree, final order, or process; that
the cause or pretence of such restraint was certain bench
warrants issued upon indictments against him in the Court of
General Sessi6ns of the Peace of the city and county of New
York; and that those indictments, copies of which are exhibited
with the petition, charge him with the commission of certain
offences over which that court " has not and never has had
jurisdiction." The relief asked was that the petitioner be dischaiged from the custody of the state authorities.
The indictments referred to were five in number and were
based upon the Penal Code of New York, which, among other
things, declares any person guilty of forgery in the second
degree and punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years who, with intent to defraud, forges an entry
made in any book of records or accounts kept by a corporation
doing business within the State, or in any account kept by
such a corporation, whereby any pecuniary obligation, claim,
or credit is or purports to be created, increased, diminished,

Opinion of the Court.

discharged or in any manner affected; and any person guilty
of forgery in the third degree and punishable by imprisonment
for not more than five years, who, with intent to defraud or
conceal any larceny or misappropriation of auy money or
property, alters, erases, obliterates, or destroys an account,
book of accounts, record or writing, belonging to, or appertaining to the business of a corporation, association, public
office or officer, partnership or individual; or makes a false
entry in any such account or book of accounts; or wilfully
omits to make true entry of any material particular in' any
such account or book of accounts, made, written, or kept by
him or under his direction. Penal Code, New York, §g 511,
515, 524, 525.
In some of the indictments the offence is charged to have
been committed by Eno in 1883; in the others, in the year
1881.
Each indictment alleges that the offence described was commitred by the accused while he was president of the Second
National Bank in the city of New York. It also appears
from the indictments that the alleged forgeries consisted in
the making of certain false entries in the books and accounts
of tat bank with intent to defraud and to conceal the misappropriation of its moneys.
By the Revised Statutes of the United States it is provided:
"SEc. 563. The District Courts shall have jurisdiction as
follows: First. Of all crimes and -offences cognizable under
the authority of the United States, committed within their
respective diftricts, or upon the high seas, the punishment of
which is not capital, except in the cases mentioned in section
fifty-four hundred and twelve, Title ' CRimEs.'"

"SEc. 629. The Circuit Courts have original jurisdiction
as follows: ...
Twentieth. Exclusive cognizance of all
crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the
United States, except where it is or may be otherwise provided by law, and concurrent jurisdiction with the District
Courts of crimes and offences-cognizable therein"'
"SEO. 711. The jurisdiction vested in the courts of the
United States in the cases and proceedings hereinafter men-

OCTOBER TERM. 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

tioned shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States:
First. Of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority
of the United States."
By section 5209, Title, National Banks, it is provided that
!I every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk or agent of
any association who embezzles, abstracts or wilfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of the association;
. . . or who makes any false entry in any book, report or
statement of the association, with intent, in either case, to
injure or defraud the association or any other company, body
politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive
any officer of the association, or any agent appointed to examine the affairs of any such association; and every person
who with like intent aids or abets any officer, clerk 6r agent
in any violation of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not less than five years
nor more than ten."
"§ 5328. Nothing in this Title [Crimes] shall be held to
take away or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof."
The Circuit Court held that the several offences for which
the defendant was indicted were cognizable under the authority of the United States, and that the jurisdiction vested in the
courts of the United States to punish them was exclusive of
the courts of the State; and for that reason it was adjudged
that the accused was restrained of his liberty in violation of
the Constitution and laws of the United States. He was consequently discharged from custody. The court in its opinion
said that "if any serious doubt were entertained as to the
want of jurisdiction of the Court of General Sessions of the
city of New York and the consequent want of authority to
retain the petitioner in custody, such a disposition of the present proceeding would be made as would permit that question
to be raised, in the event of a conviction upon the indictment,
after a trial."
The circumstances under which a court of the United States
is at liberty upon habeas corpus to discharge one held in custody under the process of a state court was considered in Ex

NEW YORK v. ENO.
Opinion of the Court.

parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251, 252. Royall was charged by
indictments in one of the courts of Virginia with having violated certain statutes of that Commonwealth. being held in
custody by the state authorities for trial he presented petitions
for habeas corpus in the Circuit .ourt of the United States
for the Eastern District of Virginia and prayed to be discharged upon the ground that the statutes under which he had
been indicted were repugnant to the Constitution of the United
States and, consequently, that he was restrained of his liberty
in violation of that instrument. Rev. Stat. §§ 751, 752, 753,
754, 755, 761, 764; Act of March 3, 1885, c. 353, 23 Stat. 437.
The petitions were dismissed, and the cases were brought by
appeal to this court.
This court held that Congress intended to invest the courts
of the Union and the justices and judges thereof with power,
upon writ -of habeas corpus, to restore to liberty any person
within their respective jurisdictions who is.held in custody, by
whatever authority, in violation of the Constitution or any
law or treaty of the United States; that the statute contemplated that cases might arise when the power thus conferred
should be exercised during the progress of proceedings instituted against the petitioner in a state court, or by or under
the authority of a State, on account of the very matter presented for determination by the writ of habeas corpus. But
it was adjudged that the statute did not imperatively require
the Circuit Court by writ of habeas corpus to wrest the petitioner from the custody of the state officers in advance of his
trial in the state court; that while the Circuit Court of the
United States- has the power to do so, and could discharge the
accused in advance of his trial, if he be restrained of his liberty
in violation of the National Constitution, it is not bound in
every case to exercise such power immediately upon application being made for the writ.
"We cannot suppose," the court said, "that Congress
intended to compel those courts by such means, to draw to
themselves, in the first instance, the control of all criminal
prosecutions commenced in state courts exercising authority
within the same territorial limits where the accused claims

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

that he is held in custody in violation of the Constitution of
the United States. The injunction to hear the case summarily, and thereupon 'to dispose of the party as law and
justice require,' does not deprive the court of discretion as to
the time and mode in which it will exert the powers conferred
upon it. That discretion should be exercised in the light of
the relations existing, under our system of government,
between the judicial tribunals of the Union and of the States,
and in recognition of the fact that the public good requires
that those relations be not disturbed by unnecessary conflict
between courts equally bound to guard and protect rights
secured by the Constitution. When the petitioner is in
custody by state authority for an act done or omitted to be
done in pursuance of a law of the United States, or of an
order, process, or decree of a court or judge thereof ; or where,
being a subject or citizen of a foreign state, and domiciled
therein, he is in custody, under like authority, for an act done
or omitted under any alleged rigat, title, authority, privilege,
protection, or exemption claimed under the commission, or
order, or sanction of any foreign state, or under color thereof,
the validity and effect whereof depend upon the law of
nations; in such and like cases of urgency, involving the
authority and operations of the General Government, or the
obligations of this country to, or its relations with, foreign
nations, the courts of the United States have frequently interposed by writs of habeas corpus and discharged prisoners who
were held in custody under state authority. So, also, when
they are in the custody of a state officer, it may be necessary,
by use of the writ, to bring them into a court of the United
States to testify as witnesses. The present cases involve no
such considerations. Nor do their circumstances, as detailed
in the petitions, suggest any reason why the state court of
original jurisdiction may not, without interference upon the
part of the courts of the United States, pass upon the question
which is raised as to the constitutionality of the statutes under
which the appellant is indicted. The Circuit Court was not
at liberty, under the circumstances disclosed, to presume that
the decision of the state court would be otherwise than is

NEW YORK v. ENO.
Opinion of the Court.

required by the fundamental law of the land, or that- it would
disregard the settled principles of constitutional law announced
by this court, upon which is clearly conferred the power to
decide ultimately and finally all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States."
Again in the same case: "That these salutary principles
may have full operation, and in harmony with what we suppose was the intention of Congress in the enactments in question, this court holds that where a person is in custody under
p'rocess from a state court of original jurisdiction, for an
alleged offence against the laws of such State, and it is claimed
that he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Circuit Court- has a discretion,
whether it will discharge him upon habeas corpus in advance
of his trial in the court in which he is indicted; that discretion, however, to be subordinated to any special circumstances
requiring immediate action. When the state court shall have
finally acted upon the case, the Circuit Court has still a discretion whether, under all the circumstances then existing,
the accused, if convicted, shall be put to his writ of error
from the highest -court of the State, or whether it will proceed, by -writ of habeas corpus, summarily to determine
whether the petitioner is restrained of his liberty in violation
of the Constitution of the United States." See also Taylor v.
Oarryl, 20 How. 583, 595, and Covell v. t1eyman, 111 U. S.
176, 182. Of course, the discretion here referred to is a legal
discretion to be controlled in its exercise by such principles as
are applicable to the particular case.in hand.
In addition to the petitions presented to the Circuit Court
of the United States, Royall made an original application to
this court for a writ of habeas corpus based upon the same
facts as those set forth in the other petitions. The application was denied upon the grounds stated in the previous cases.
.ExparteRoyall, 117 U. S. 254.
At the same term of this court, Exo parte Fonda, 117 U. S.
516, 518, was deterrAined. That was an original application
to this court for a writ of habeas corpus by one who was a
clerk in a national bank, and who alleged in his petition that

OCTOBER TERM, 1894Opinion of the Court.

he had been convicted in one of the courts of Michigan under
a statute of that State, and sentenced to imprisonment for
having embezzled the funds of that banking association. The
principal ground upon which he asked for a writ of habeas
.corpus and for his discharge from custody was that the
offence foi which he was tried was covered by the statutes of
the United States, and was therefore exclusively cognizable by
the Federal courts. This court denied the application upon
the authority of Ex parte Royall, observing that no reason
had been suggested why the Supreme Court of the State
might not review the judgment of the inferior state court
upon the question as to the application of the statute under
which the conviction was had to embezzlement by the servants and clerks of national banks, nor why it should not be
permitted to do so without interference by the courts of the
United States; that the question appeared to be one which, if
properly presented by the record, might be reviewed in this
court after a decision by the Supreme Court of State adverse
to the petitioner. The judgment of conviction in that case
was subsequently reviewed in the Supreme Court of Michigan,
and that court held that jurisdiction of the offence charged
against Fonda was exclusive in the Federal court. Peo/e v.
Fonda, 62 Michigan, 401.
The rule laid down in the cases in this court, above cited,
has been recognized in In re .Duncan,139 U. S. 449, 454;
.In qre Wood, 140 U. S. 278, 289 ; Cook v. Hart, 146 U. S. 183,
19-1; and In re Frederick, 149 U. S. 70, 75.
It may be well to refer to the case of In re Loney, 134 U. S.
372, 375. It will be observed that this court in Ex parte
Royall recognized certain cases as constituting exceptions to
the general rule- among which are cases of urgency, involving the authority and operations of the general government.
Loney's case was of that class. It appeared from the record
that he was duly summoned to give his deposition in a contested election case pending in the House of Representatives
summons he was

obliged to obey, unless prevented by sickness or unavoidable
accident, under the penalty of forfeiting a named sum to the

NEW YORK v. ENO.
Opinion of the Court.

party at whose instance he was summoned, and of becoming
subject to fine and imprisonment, Rev. Stat. § 116; that he
appeared before a notary public in obedience to such summons
and proceeded to give his deposition; and that while in the
office of an attorney for the purpose of completing his testimony, he was arrested under a warrant issued by a justice of
the peace and based upon the affidavit of one of the parties to
the contested election case charging him with wilful perjury
committed in his deposition.
Having been arrested under that warrant, he sued out a
writ of habeas corpus from the Circuit Court of the United
States upon the ground that he was restrained of his liberty
in violation of the Constitution of the United States. That
court, in advance of any trial in the state court for the offence
charged against Loney, adjudged that the offence was punishable only under section 5392 of the Revised Statutes, and was
exclusively cognizable by the courts of the United States. He
was discharged, and the judgment was affirmed by this court.
It is clear from this statement that that case was one of
urgency, involving in a substantial sense the authority and
operations of the general government. The obvious effect
of Loney's arrest, under the circumstances disclosed, was to
embarrass one of the parties in the contested election case in
obtaining evidence in his behalf, intimidate witnesses whom
he might desire to introduce, and delay the preparation of the
case for final determination by the House of Representatives.
This court, therefore, said: "It is essential to the impartial
and efficient administration of justice in the tribunals of the
nation, that witnesses should be able to testify freely before
them, unrestrained by legislation of the State, or by fear of
punishment in the state courts., The administration of justice
in the national tribunals would be greatly embarrassed and
impeded if a witness testifying before a court of the United
States, or upon a contested election of a member of Congress,
were liable to prosecution and punishment in the courts of the
State upon a charge of perjury, preferred by a disappointed
suitor or contestant, or instigated by local passion or prejudice."

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion.: Field, Shiras, JJ.

Whether the offences described in the indictments against
Eno are offences against the State of New York and punishable under its laws, or are made by existing statutes offences
also against the United States and are exclusively cognizable
by courts of the United States; and whether the same acts,
upon the part of the accused, may be offences against both
the National and State governments and punishable in the
judicial tribunals of each government, without infringing upon
the constitutional guaranty against being twice put in jeopardy
of limb for the same offence; these are questions which the
state court of original jurisdiction is competent to decide in
the first instance; and its obligation to render such decision
as will give full effect to the supreme law of the land and protect any right secured by it to the accused is the same that
rests upon the courts of the United States. When the claim
of the accused of immunity from prosecution in a state court
for the offences charged against him has been passed upon by
the highest court of New York in which it can be determined,
he may then, if the final judgment of that court be adverse to
him, invoke the jurisdiction of this court for his protection in
respect of any Federal right distinctly asserted by him, but
which may be denied by such judgment.
*Without considering the merits of the several questions discussed by counsel, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court
erred in granting the prayer of the accused. He should not
have been disoharged from the custody of the state authorities,
especially as he does not appear to have been under indictment in any court of the United States for the offences alleged
to have been committed by him.
The judgment is reversed with directions to dismiss the writ
of habeas corpus, and to remand the accused to the custody
of the proper state authorities.

NEW YORK v. ENO.
Dissenting Opinion: Field, Shiras, JJ.

States directing the dismissal of proceedings against the defendant upon the indictments against him found in the state court
of New York.
The 711th section of the Revised Statutes provides that the
courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction exclusive of
the courts of the several States of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States; and section
5209 of the Revised Statutes, relating to national banks, provides that "every president. director, cashier,. teller, clerk or
agent of any association who embezzles, abstracts or wilfully
misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of the association; . . . or who makes any false entry in any book,
report or statement of the association, with intent in either
case to injure or defraud the association or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or
to deceive an officer of an association, or any agent appointed
to examine the affairs of any such association ; and every person who with like intent aids or abets any officer, clerk or
agent iii violation of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not less than five years
nor more than ten." The Circuit Court was thus cognizable,
under the authority of the United States, of the several
offences for which the defendant was indicted ; and the jurisdiction vestpd in the court of the United States was exclusive
of all jurisdtetion of the offences in the state courts. It would,
therefore, subserve no useful purpose to proceed with the cases
in the state court and thus ascertain what that court might
have done or would have done bad it possessed jurisdiction.
Until its jurisdiction was established, its determination, either
one way or the other, would be only an idle proceeding. Itcould not, under any circumstances, take cognizance of the
cases charged against the. defendant, and hold him under
them. Hewas, therefore, entitled to his discharge whenever
the matter was properly brought to the attention of the
Federal court.
