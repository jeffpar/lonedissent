APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 86. Argued October 12, 15, IS91. -Decided

FOR

November 19, 1894.

The fifth claim in reissued letters patent No. 9542, granted January 23
1881, to Joseph Tilton and Rufus M. Stiver s for a spring for vehicles,
on the surrender of letters patent No. 157,430, dated December 1, 1874,
is an expansion of the invention described in the original patent, and the
reissue is thus invalidated.
Letters patent No. 197,689, granted November 27, 1877, to Henry Timken
for improvement in carriage springs, are void for want of patentable
novelty in the invention so patented.
Letters patent No. 239,850, granted April 5, 188l, to Cyrus W. Saladee for
an improvement in spring-supports for vehicles, wagon-seats, etc., relate
to a device which was anticipated by another invention made more than
two years prior to the application for that patent, and reduced to practice
prior to that application, and by other inventions named in the opinion
of the court, and are void for want of patentable novelty.

THIS was a bill in equity, filed by Henry Timken in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District
of Ohio against Thomas D. Olin and Edwin D. Olin to restrain
the infringement of three letters patent, namely, No. 197,689,
granted to Henry Timken, November 27, 1877, for improvement in "carriage Springs ;" No. 239,850 to C. W. Saladec,
April 5, 1881, for "road wagon;" reissue patent No. 9542,
