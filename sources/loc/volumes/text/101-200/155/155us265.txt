WARREN v.,KEEP.
APPEAL FROM THE OIROUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 60. Argued and submitted November 8, 1894. -Decided

December 3, 1894.

This court will not reverse the conclusions of the master, sustained by the
court below, upon the extent of the infringement of a patent, when the
evidence is conflicting, unless some obvious error or mistake is pointed
out.
Where a patent is for a particular part of an existing machine, It is necessary,
in orderto establish a claim for substantial damages for infringement,
to show what portion of the profits is due to the particular invention
secured by the patent in suit ; but when the patented invention is
for a new article of manufacture, the patentee is entitled to damages
arising from the manufacture and sale of the entire article.
The defendants not having set up in the court bldw a climm for an allowance of manufacturer's profits, or offered evidence by which it could be
estimated, there is no foundation on which to base such a claim in this
court.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

OCTOBER TERAM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Psek Cowen for appellants submitted on his brief.
.Mr. Nelson Davenport for appellee.
MR.JUSTICE SHIRAS delivered the opinion of the court.
On the 14tb day of Maich, 1881, William I. Keep filed a
bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of New York, against John Hobert
Warren, Joseph W. Fuller, George A. Wells, and Walter P.
Warren, alleging complainant's ownership of several letters
patent and infringement by the defendants.
The subject-matter of the letters patent was certain devices
and designs for base-burning stoves and stove grates.
The case was put at issue by an answer and replication, but
on the 20th day of March, 1883, a decree was entered by
consent, declaring the validity of the letters patent set forth
in the bill, and infringement by the defendants of some of
them.
The decree directed that an account should be taken 'for
profits and damages upon all the patents so declared to be
infringed, but contained the following provision: "That such
gains, profits, damages, and accounting shall not apply to
any stoves made or sold by said defendants before February
1, 1876, nor to any grates made or sold by said defendants
before that date, except as to grates covered by said letters
patent No. 139,583, and supplied by defendants after January 1, 1876, to stoves originally sold by them without such
grates."

The master found that, between January 1, 1876, and
January 1, 1882, the defendants sold grates upon which the
profits amounted to $11,363.54, and that amount, with six
cents' damages and costs, were awarded by the master to and
in favor of the complainant.
Exceptions to this report were filed by the defendants,
alleging that the evidence did not sustain the master in
finding the number of the infringing grates sold by the defendants, -nor in finding the amount of profits which the defendants had realized from the infringement.

WARREN v. KEEP.
Opinion of the Court.

The court below sustained an exception to the action of 'the
master in alloiving the sum of $348.00 as profits on four
hundred grates, made and sold by the defendants between
January 1, .1879, and July 1, 1879, but overruled the. other
exceptions, and entered a final decree in favor of the complainant for the sum of $10,510.86 with costs, from which
decree the defendants appealed to this court.
The first error insisted upon is that the evidence did not
justify the master in finding the number of grates sold by
the defendants during the six years over which the accounting extended. The defendants' contention is not that. due
effect was not given to the evidence adduced on their behalf,
but that the plaintiff's evidence, consisting chiefly of the testimony of Keep himself, did not clearly establish the number
of the infringing grates sold.
Our examination of this part of the subject has not enabled
us to approve the defendants' contention. The master's action in restricting his finding to grates sold as separate and
independent articles, and in excluding from the account
all grates which were sold in or with a stove, was quite
as favorable to the defendants as they had any right to claim.
In finding the number of grates sold during the period in
question, as separate articles, the master depended chiefly on
the entries in the defendants' books, as -testified -to and
explained on the part of the complainant by Keep, who had
been engaged With the defendants for more than eight years,
and claimed to be thoroughly acquainted with their methods
of business, and, on the part of the defendants, by L. W.
Drake, who was their assistant superintendent. There was a
considerable amount of this evidence; and it was, to some
extent, conflicting. The master acted in view of this evidence,
and the court below concurred in his finding, except in some
unimportant particulafs. As no obvious error or mistake has
been pointed out to us, their conclusions must be permitted t6
stand. Tilgkman v. P'roctor, 125 U. S. 136; Crawfor'd v.
.Neal, 144 U. S. 585; Farrerv. Ferris,145 U. S. 132.
Assuming that the number of infringing grates sold by the
defendants was correctly found, we have next to consider

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

whether the master erred in awarding to the complainant the
entire profits made upon the grates so sold. The appellants'
contention is that there was no evidence tending to show how
much of the profits was due to the complainant's invention,
and that hence he was entitled to recover nominal damages
only. It is, no doubt, well settled that where a patent is for
a particular part of an existing machine, it is not sufficient to
ascertain the profits on the whole machine, but it must be
shown what portion of the profits is due to the particular
invention secured by the patent in suit. Blake v. Robertson,
94: U. S. 728; Dobson v. Hartford Carpet Co., 114 U. S. 439.
But it is equally true that, where the patented invention is for
a new article of manufacture, which is sold separately, the
patentee is entitled to damages arising from the manufacture
and sale of the entire article. Jfanufacturing Co. v. Cowing,
105 U. S. 253; Jurlbut v. Schillinger, 130 U. S. 456; Crosby
Valve Co. v. Safety Valve Co., 141 U. S. 441.
The grates, on whose sale the master assessed profits, were
not sold as an incident to any particular stove, but as an independent, marketable article, and the infringers must pay the
entire profits realized from the sale thereof. The statement
that, at this late day, there can be a grate, for use in ordinary
stoves, which is entirely new, and patentable in all its parts
and as an entirety, is somewhat surprising; but that is what
we learn from this record. The patent infringed contains
eight claims,' of which seven are for the several parts of the
grate, and the eighth for the entire device, and the defendants
are precluded by the decree, to which they consented, from
contending that the plaintiff is to be restricted, in his demand
for damages, to any one feature or part of the grate.
It is further claimed that the master ought to have reported
nominal damages only, because there was evidence before him
to the effect that the defendants, at the time they made and
sold the complainant's grate, likewise made and sold another
kind of a grate, called the Hathaway grate, and that the same
price was received for both kinds. From this it is said to
follow that there was no advantage derived by the defendants
from the manufacture and sale of the complainant's grate,

WARREN .v. KEEP'.
Opinion of the Court.

above that which they would have received had they made
and sold the Hathaway grate only. We do not think that
the consequence suggested necessarily follows as matter of fact,
nor that it has any relevancy as matter of law.
.Aowry-v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, and Littlefeld v. Perry,
21 Wall. 205, which are relied on by the defendants to sustain

this contention, were both cases in which the patented features
were so blended with other features not covered by the
patent that it became necessary to inquire what portion of the
defendants' profits was due to the patented features, and to
apportion the profits acgordingly. Thus it was said in .fowry
v. Whitney, p. 652: "The patent is for an entire process, made
up of several constituents. The patentee does not claim to
have been the inventor of the constituents. The exclusive
use of them singly is not secured to him. What is secured is
their use when arranged in the process."
In Littlefteld v. Perry,the patent was for certain improvements in cooking stoves, and the court below, having found
an. infringement, decreed an account "of all the profits, gains,
and advantages which the said defendants have received, or
which have arisen or accrued to them, from the manufacture,
use, or sale of stoves embracing the improvements described
in and covered by the said letters patent." This court said,
p. 228: "The decree is, as we think, too broad. . . . The
order is to account for all profits received from the manufacture, etc., of stoves embracing the improvements covered by
any of the patents. This would cover all the profits made
upon a stove having in it any one of the improvements patented. The true inquiry is as to the profits which the defendants have realized as the consequence of the improper use of
these improvements. Such profits belong to the plaintiff, and
should be accounted for to him."
We think the court below was justified in saying: "The
complainant's grate was made and sold separately from stoves.
Unquestionably it was intended for use in stoves; but so are
many devices that may be the subject' of distinct inventions.
It was not sold for use in one pattern of stove alone; it could
be used in many different stoves. Although in general appear-

OCTOBER TERMTY1, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

ance like other grates, it is so constructed that no part can be
used upon any other grate, and no parts of other grates can be
used upon it. Remove the patented features, and nothing
remainS. Although it is an improvement upon stoves, the
complainant is not seeking to recover the profits upon the
stoves, but upon the improvement only. The rule requiring
that the profits arising from the patented features must be
separated from those arising from the unpatented features has
little application in a case where every feature is patented."
Finally, it is contended that the master and the court below
erred in not allowing credit to the defendants for a manufacturer's profit.
We are relieved from considering what might be a problem
of some difficulty, namely, when a complainant's damages are
to be measured by the profits of the defendant, what credit
should be allowed to the latter, as a mere agency for producing the patented article, for a so-called manufacturer's profit,
by the fact that the defendants, neither before the master nor
in the court below, made any claim for such an allowance, or
offered any evidence by which it could be estimated. The
complainant testified as to the cost of making the grates, and
stated that he included in his estimate of the cost a manufacturer's profit. As no countervailing evidence was put in by
the defendants and no specific exception was made to the
master's calculations, that he made no allowance for a manufacturer's profit, we think there is no foundation on which to
base such a claim now.
The decree of the Circuit Court is
Affirmed.
