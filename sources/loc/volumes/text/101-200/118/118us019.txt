JOHNSTON v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Statement of Facts.

JOHNSTON v. DISTRICT OF COLUM
ABIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Argued March 23, 24, 1886.-Decided April 19, 1886.

Evidence that the plan on which a sewer has been constructed by municipal
authorities had not been judiciously selected is inadmissible to support an
action against the municipality by the owner of land injured by the overflow of water from the sewer.

This was an action against the District of Columbia by a
citizen and taxpayer in Washington to recover damages caused
to his house and land fronting- on Missouri Avenue, in the
summer of 1877, by the overflow of foul water from a sewer
in that avenue, which the declaratioh alleged that the defendant knowingly constructed and continued upon an unreasonable and defective plan, and of inadequate capacity for its
purpose, and wrongfully permitted to become choked up. The
defendant denied its liability.
The plaintiff's bill of exceptions stated that he testified that
at the time alleged his house and land were overflowed and
injured by foul water from this sewer; that he noticed that
the water in*the avenue was very deep ; and that he never
saw or knew of any flooding or overflow of the avenue or of
his property until the sewer was constructed. The rest of the
bill of exceptions was as follows:
"And to sustain further the issues joined, the plaintiff put
upon the stand, as his witness, Benjamin Severson, a citizen of
Washington, and an engineer by profession, who testified to,
the Tiber sewer being two feet lower at its base than the
Missouri Avenue sewer where they meet each other; and being
asked by the counsel for the plaintiff what, in his, opinion, the
consequence would be in case of a freshet or great fall of rain,
the question was objected to by the counsel of the defendant,
unless the counsel for the plaintiff stated his object in asking
such c4uestion; and thereupon it appeared that it was asked
with the view of showing by that witness that the plan on
which the sewer had been constructed by the authorities of the,

Opinion of the Court.

District had not been judiciously selected; and thereupon the
testimony was objected to, and the court, after argument, sustained the objection, to which ruling the plaintiff's counsel excepted."
The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, the exceptions were overruled by the court in general term, and the
plaintiff sued out this writ of error.

MR. JusTIcE GR&Y, after stating the case as above reported,
delivered: the opinion of the court.
The duties of the municipal authorities, in adopting a general
plan of drainage, and determining when and where sewers shall

Opinion of the Court.

be built, of what size and at what level, are of a guasi judicial
nature, involving the exercise of deliberate judgment and
large discretion, and depending upon considerations affecting
the public health and general convenience throughout an extensive territory; and the exercise of such judgment and
discretion, in the selection and adoption of the general plan or
system of drainage, is not subject to revision by a court or jury
in a private action for not sufficiently draining a particular lot
of land. But the construction and repair of sewers, according
to the general plan so adopted, are simply ministerial duties;
and for any negligence in so constructing a sewer, or keeping
it in repair, the municipality which has constructed and owns
the sewer may be sued by a person whose property is thereby
injured.
The principal decisions upon the subject are collected in the
briefs of counsel, and generally, if 'hot uniformly, support these
propositions. The letlding authorities are the judgments of the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, delivered by Mr.
Justice Hoar, in Child v. Boston, 4 Allen, 41, 51-53, and of the
Court of Appeals of New York, delivered by Chief Justice
Denio, in .Will v. Brooklyn, 32 N. Y. 489, 495-500.
In Barne8 v. District of Columbia, 91 U. S. 540, 556, it was
said that in Rochester White Lead Co. v. Rocheter, 3 IN.Y.
463, "the city was held liable because it constructed a sewer
which was not of sufficient capacity to carry off the water
draining into it. The work was well done; but the adoption
and carrying out of the plan was held to be an act of negligence." But this was clearly a mistake; for in the Rochester
Case the fact was distinctly found that the insufficiency of the
culvert to carry-off the water was owing, not merely to the
smallness of its size, but to "the want of skill in its construction;" 3 N. Y. 465; and the case was distinguished on that
ground in .Mills v. Brooklyn, 32 N. Y. 499. The question in
judgment in Barnes v. JDistrict of Columbia, as well as in
Weighitman v. Washington, 1 Black, 39, was of municipal liability, not for an injury to property by a sewer, but for a personal
injury to a traveller by a want of repair in the highway,
'a question not now before us. In Barton v. Syracuse, 36 N. Y.
