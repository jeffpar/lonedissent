UNITED STATES v. LANDRAM.
Opinion of the Court.

UNITED STA-TES v. LANDRAM.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Submitted April 5, 1886.-Decided April 19, 1886.

After the act of March 1,1879, amending the laws relating to internal revenue
took effect, collectors of internal revenue were entitled to compensation as
follows: (1) to salaries graded according to the amount of their annual col-.
lectiQns, the minimum salary being $2000 and the maximun $4,500 ; (2) in
addition to the salary to a commission of one half of one per cent. on
taxes or spirits collected by sales of tax-paid stamps, provided the total net
compensation should not be more than $4500; (3) to such further allowance
as the Secretary of the Treasury might make, provided the limitation of
$4500 as the total net compensation was not exceeded.

The case is stated in the opinion of the court. The cause
was decided in the Court of Claims on the 18th of February,
1886, and at once brought here on appeal and submitted.

the opinion of the court.
By § 2 of the act of March 1, 1879, entitled "An Act to
amend the laws relating to internal revenue," ch. 125, 20 Stat.
327, the 12th section of the act of February 8, 1875, ch. 36, 18
Stat. 307, was amended so as to read as follows:
"That each collector of internal revenue shall be authorized
to appoint, by an instrument in writing under his hand, as
many. deputies as he may think proper, to be compensated for
their services by such allowances as shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Allowances shall also be
made in like manner for salary'and office expenses of collectors,
all of which shall be in lieu of the salary and commissions
heretofore provided by law: Provided however, Th,-t the

Opinion of the Court.

salaries of collectors shall be fixed at two thousand dollars
each per annum where the annual collections amount to
twenty-five thousand dollars or less, and shall, by the Secretary, on the recommendation of the Commissioner, be graduated up to the maximum limit of four thousand-five hundred
dollars; which latter sum shall be allowed in all cases where
the collections amount to. one millioin of dollars or upward.
Provided, That the Secretary of the Treasury, on the
recommendation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, be
authorized to malke such further allowances, from time to time,
as may be reasonable, in cases in which, from the territorial
extent of the district, or from the amount of internal duties
collected, it may seem just to make such allowances; but no
such allowance shall be, made if more than one year has
elapsed since the close of the fiscal year in which the services
were-tendered. But the total net compensation of a collector
shall not in any case exceed four thousand five hundred dollars
a year ; and no collector shall be entitled- to any portion of
the salary pertaining to the office unless such collector shall
have been confirmed by the Senate, except in cases of commissions to fill vacancies occurring during the recess of the
Senate."
By § 5 of the same act it was provided as follows : "That
section thirty-three hundred and fourteen [of the Revised
Statutes shall] be amended by striking out all after said number and substituting the following: 'The books of tax-paid
stamps issued to any collector shall be charged to his account
at the full value of the tax on the number of gallons represented on the stamps and coupons contained in said books; and
every collector shall make a monthly return to the Commissioner of Intelmal Revenue of all tax-paid stamps issued by
him to be affixed to any cask or package containing distilled
spirits on which the tax has been paid, and account for the
amount of the tax collected; and when the said collector returns to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue any book of
marginal stubs, which it shall be his duty to do as soon as all
the stamps contained in the book when issued to him have
been used, and accounts for the tax on the number of gallons

represented on the stamps and coupons that were contained in
said book, there shall be allowed to the collector a commission
of one-half of one per centum on the amount of such tax in addition to any other commission by law allowed; Provided,
That the total net compensation of collectors as fixed by this
title shall not be thereby increased.'
This so-called amendment was simply a re-enactment of
38314 without any change whatever.
While these sections were in force, to wit, during the five
fiscal years beginning with July 1, 1879, and ending with
June 30, 1884, William J. Landram, the appellee, was the collector of internal revenue for the eighth district of Kentucky.
During that period-he received a salary as follows: For the
years ending respectively on June 30, 1880, and June 30,1883,
$3000 for each year; for the years ending respectively June
30, 1881, and June 30, 1882, $2875 for each year; and for the
year ending June 30, 1884, $4375. During each of the years
'above mentioned Landram collected a large amount of taxes on
distilled splifts by the sale of tax-paid stamps, on which, limiting his total net compensation for each year to $4500, the
commissions for the whole five years to which he would have
been entitled, on the assumption that § 3314 of the Revised
Statutes still remained in force, would amount to $4724.78.
The accounting officers of the Treasury refused to allow him
this sum or any part of it. He therefore brought his suit
against the United States, in the Court of Claims, to recovbr it.
Upon a finding of the foregoing facts the Court of Claims gave
him judgment for said sum, and the United States appealed.
The policy of allowing a commission of one-half of one per
cent. on taxes collected from distilled spirits by the side of taxpaid stamps was begun by the act of July 20, 1868, ch. 185, 15
Stat. 125, which required that the taxes on distilled spirits

should be paid by affixing to the packages in which they were
contained the prescribed stamps, and "allowed a commission
of one-half of one per centum on the amount of the tax on spirits
distilled after the passage of" that "act in addition to anr
other commission by law allowed, which" should "be eqiially
divided between the collector receiving the tax and the asses-

sor of the district in which the distilled spirits were produced."
This policy was continued by the act of December 24, 1872,
ch. 13, 17 Stat. 401, which, after abolishing by § 1 the office
of assessor of internal revenue, provided by § 6 that the
commission of one-half of one per centum allowed by the
act of July 20, 1868, to the collector and assessor should be
paid to the collector, provided that " the total net compensation of collectors" should not be thereby increased. The provisions of the acts of 1868 and 1872 remained in force until
June 22, 1874, when, having been embodied in § 3314 of the
Revised Statutes, they were re-enacted. By the act of March
1, 1879, § 3314, though still in force, was re enacted in totidem
verbis, and by the act of May 28, 1880, ch. 108, 21 Stat. 145,
entitled "An Act to amend the laws in relation to internal revenue," the same section was repeated and re-enacted, word for
word.
It is asserted by counsel for the appellee, and- not disputed
by counsel for appellant, that prior to the passage of the act of
March 1, 1879, ubi supra, the right of collectors of internal
revenue to the one-half of one per centum commissions on
taxes collected on distilled spirits was never questioned. After
June 22, 1874, the commissions were allowed and paid solely
by virtue of the provisions of § 3314 of the Revised Statutes.
On the passage of the act of March 1, 1879, the right of the
collectors to commissions was for the first time disputed. It
seems to us clear that this right was not taken away by that act.
When it was passed § 3314 of the Revised Statutes allowing
the commissions was in force. It was a plain, unambiguous
provision whose meaning had not been doubted, and which was
not open to construction. Being in force, there was no reason
for its re-enactment by the act of March 1, 1879, except to express in a most unmistakable ifianner the purpose of Congress
that it should continue in force, and should not be considered
as in any way modified by that act. This purpose Congress
reiterated by repeating and re-enacting the same section in the
act of May 28, 1880. By virtue of the provisions thus enacted
and re-enacted the right of the appellee to the commissions
would seem to be plain.

UNITED STATES v. LANDRAM.
Opinion of the Court.

'The only ground upon which the appellants try to escape this
conclusion is by an argument which amounts to this: that Congress, by § 2 of the act of March 1,1879, intended virtually to repeal by implication that part of § 3314 of the Revised Statutes
relating to collectors' commissions, which, by § 5 of the same
act, it deliberately, and, word for word, re-enacted. Conceding
that this argument is entitled to any weight, it is to be noted
that, if the provision referred to was repealed by the same act
which re-enacted it, it was an independent enactment, and, without change or qualification, again restored to the statute book
by the subsequent act of May 2S, 1880, ubi supra,where it hat
remained ever since, covering more than four-fifths of the period for which the appellee claims the commissions sued for in
this case.
But it is not necessary to resort to the act of May 28, 1880,
to sustain the right of the appellee to any part of his commissions. It is a settled rule of construction that "one part of a
statute must be so construed by another that the whole may,
if possible, stand; ut res magis valeat quam jveeat.;" 1 B1.
Com. 89; or, as otherwise expressed, that every clause in a
statute should have effect, and one portion should not be placed
in antagonism to another. Br'ooks v. .Aobile School Board,
31 Ala. 227. Applying this rule to the interpretation of §§
2 and 5 of the act of March 1, 1879, so far as they relate to
the compensation of collectors, their meaning appears to be,
first, that salaries shall be allowed to collectors, graded according to the amount of their annual collections, the minimum salary being $2000 and. the maximum $4500; second, that in addition to the salary a commission of one-half of lone per centam
on the taxes on spirits collected by -ales of tax-paid stimps
shall be allowed collectors, provided iat their total net compensation shall not be more than $4600"; and, third, that the
Secretary of the Treasury may make further allowances, provided the limitation of $4500 as the total net compensation of
the collector is not exceeded. Thus construed, both sections
of the statute are given effect without violence to the language
or spirit of either. No construction of the two secions would
be so incongruous and unreasonable as to hold that-Congress-
