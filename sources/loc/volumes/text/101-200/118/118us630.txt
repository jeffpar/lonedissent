to call for others of a different character. No implication can
arise, one way or the other, from his inaction. All that the
company could ask or expect under the law was that he
should prescribe a reasonable compensation for its service, and
that the service would be continued so long as the public
interests should require. No implication of law could extend
further than this.
And as to the alleged duration of four years, it is sufficient
to say, that the regulation of the department referred to was
designed only to further the administratioji of the postal
sefvice, not to impose any obligation on the PostmasterGeneral; and it would be against all analogies to hold that a
continuance of service, after the termination of a written contract for years, creates an obligation of a renewed contract,
not merely upon a like compensation, but for the same duration of time. There is no principle that could justify the im-Decreeaffirned.

PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPA1NY & Others
v. ST. LOUIS, ALTON AND TERRE HAUTE RAILROAD COMPANY.
ST. LOUIS, ALTON AND TERRE HAUTE RAILI OAD
COMPANY v. PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRIcT OF INDIANA.
Petition for rehearing. Submitted May 10, 1886.-Decided November 8,1886.

No authority is found in the Statutes of Indiana for the lease of an entire
railroad, property, and franchise for a period of ninety-nine years. The
court adheres to its views on the other questions involved in this case. See
ante, 290-318.

This was a petition for rehearing the cause reported ante,
290. The petition was submitted on the closing day of the sit-

ting of the court at the last term. The grounds set forth were
the following:
"FIRST.
Your petitioner avers that there is manifest error
in the opinion and decree of this court in the above causes, in
this: In holding, that the contract made by your petitioner
with the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad C6mpany, for the
use of its railroad by the last-named company in the manner
set out in said contract, as the same appears of record, is void
and of no effect for want of authority in said Indianapolis and
St. Louis Railrbad Company to enter into the same. Your
petitioner claims and insists that said Indianapolis and St.
Louis Railroad Company, a corporation of the State of Indiana, was expressly authorized by the laws of that State to
make such contract or agreement with your petitioner ' for the
use of its road as to the board of directors of said company
might seem proper,' and that said contract, so declared void
in the opinion rendered in this case, was fairly entered into and
fully ratified and approved by the boards of directors of each
of said companies.
"SECOND.
It further avers that there is manifest error in
the opinion and decree of this court, in this: That it is held by
this court that the guarantor companies are not bound by their
several contracts of guarantee, first, by reason of the original
contract being, in the opinion of this court, void; and, secondly,
for want of authority on the part of the said companies to enter
into such guarantee contracts. The objection to the first point
has been sufficiently stated. With regard to the second your
petitioner submits that it is erroneous in this, that this honorable court has wholly failed to take into consideration the fact
that the guarantor companies were the promoters of the original contract, and that they organized the Indianapolis and St.
Louis Company as their agent, and as an instrumentality to secure to them and each of them the use and benefit of said operating contract for the control of the through business passing
from St. Louis, eastward, over yqur petitioner's road; that
the contract of guarantee is not separable from the operating
contract to which it is attached, but with said operating
contract forms one entire contract, in which the guarantor

,companies were the chief parties in interest. It is not in the
nature of a mere guarantee for the debt, default, or miscarriage
of a third party, and it is not just and equitable to your petitioner to treat it as such, as that view leaves entirely out of
sight the chief causes which led to its being executed, and entirely ignores the direct interest which the guarantor companies
had in it and the consideration which moved directly to the
guarantor companies in support of it.
TirinD. It further avers that in said opinion and decree therq
'"
is manifest error, in this: That, holding said contrhcts of guarantee to be void, this court also holds that said guarantors are
not in any manner bound for the benefits which they and each
of them derived from the said contracts during the time the
road of your petitioner was being operated under their agent
for their use- and benefit. The rule, as stated in .the opinion of
this court, is not founded on the facts, and is not consistent
with the principles of equity asapplied to the facts."

delivered the opinion of the court.
The opinion of the court in this case, accompanying its judgment, was delivered very near the -close of the last term [see
ante, 294-318], and for that reason, among others, a special
leave was granted the appellees to file a petition for rehearing
at the beginning of the present term.
We have very carefully examined this petition, and while, on
one of the main points in the case, namely, the statutory authority of the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad Company,
under the laws of Indiana, to make the lease which was the
foundation of the suit, there are some other statutes and some
other decisions of the State and the .State court cited, we do
