he can prosecute them for the wrong. If his vessel is arrested
in its passage, without lawful warrant, he can bring the defendants before the courts to answer for their conduct. If his pilots
are duly licensed, and they are hindered or prevented from the
exercise of their business, both he and they have the same
means of redress which are afforded to every citizen whose
rights are invaded and obstructed. If the publications in the
newspapers are false and injurious, he can prosecute the publishers for libel. If a court of equity could interfere and use
its remedy of injunction in such cases, it would draw to itself
the greater part of the litigation properly belonging to courts
of law.
We think the court below should have sustained the demurrer of the defendants for wait of equity in the bill. The decree must, therefore, be

UNITED STATES v. LANGSTON.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Submitted April 26, 186.-Decided May 10, 1886.
A statute which fixes the annual salary of a public officer at a designated sum
without limitation as to time, is not abrogated or suspended by sui~sequent

enactments appropriating a less amount for his services for a particular
fiscal year, but containing no words which expressly or impliedly modify
or repeal it.
United States v. Fisher, 109 U. S. 143; and United States v. M.itchell, 109
U. S. 146, distinguished.

This was a petition in the Court of Claims to recover an
unpaid balance of salary claimed to be due defendant in error
as Minister Resident at EHayti. The defence was that Congress,
by appropriating a lesser sum, had indicated its purpose to reduce the salary. The case is stated in the opinion of the court.

Opinion of the Court.

MM. JUSTME HAwAN delivered the opinion of the court.
From September 28, 1877, until July 24, 1885, the claimant,
John M. Langston, held the office of Minister Resident and Consul General of the United States at the Republic of HIayti. At
the time he entered upon the discharge of his duties it was provided by statute as follows: "There shall be a diplon atic representative of the United States to each of the Re 1 iblics of
Hayti and Liberia, who shall be appointed by the I esident,
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall be
accredited as Minister Resident and Consul General. Tlie representative at Hayti shall be entitled to a salary of $7500 a
year, and the representative at Liberia to a salary not exceeding 400O a year." Rev. Stat. § 1683. The sum of $7500
was annually appropriated for the salary of the minister to
Hayti, from the creation of the office until the year 1883. 12

321; 19 Stat. 170, 233; 20 Stat..92, 267; 21 Stat. 134, 339.
.In the act making appropriations for the Consular and Diplomatic Service for the fiscal year ending June 30i 1879, it is
provided: "1That the following sums be and the same are hereby appropriated for the service of the fiscal year ending June
30; 1879, out of any money in the treasury, not otherwise
appropriated, for the objects hereinafter expressed, namely:
For minister resident and consul general to Hayti,
$750. . . -. And the salaries provided in this act for the
officers within named, respectively, shall be in full for the annual salaries thereof from and after July 1, 1878; and all laws
and parts of laws in confliqt with the provisions of this act are
hereby repealed." 20 Stat. 91, 92, 98. Similar provisions were
in the Diplomatic and Consular appropriation act for the fiscal
year ending June 30,1880. 20 Stat. 267, 274. A like sum was
appropriated for the fiscal years ending June 30,1881, and June

Opinion of the Court.

30, 1882, but the appropriation acts for those years did not repeat the declaration contained in the acts for the fiscal years of
1879 and 1880, to the effect that "the salaries provided in this
act for the officers within named, respectively, shall be in full
for the annual salaries thereof," &c. 21 Stat. 133, 134, 339.
In the Diplomatic and Consular Appropriation Act of July 1,
1882, certain sums were appropriated "for the service of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1883, out of any money in the
treasury, not otherwise appropriated, for the objects therein
expressed,"- one of them being "for ministers resident and
consuls general to Liberia, Hayti, Switzerland, Denmark, and
Portugal, at $5000 each, $25,000." 22 Stat. 128. The same
act provided that "hereafter the Secretary of State shall, in
the estimates of the annual expenditures of diplomatic and consular service, estimate for the entire amount required for its
support, including all commercial agents, and other officers,
whether paid by fees or otherwise, specifying the compensation to be allowed or deemed advisable in each individual case."
22 Stat. 133. It is stated in the brief of the Attorney General
that the Secretary of State made a specific estimate for the salary
of the minister resident and consul general to IHayti for the
fiscal years commencing July 1, 1883 and 1884, and that that
estimate was $5000 in each report. For each of the fiscal years
ending June 30, 1884, and June 30, 1885, the appropriation
for the minister resident and consul general at Hayti was
$5000, and in the same language as that employed in reference
to that bifficer in the act for the fiscalyear ending June 30, 1883.
In the Consular and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill of 1884,
the Committee on Appropriations in the House of Representatives reported the following paragraph as part of the bill:
"And the foregoing appropriations for Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary, Ministers Resident and
Chargds d'Affaires, Ministers Resident and Consuls Generals,
Secretaries of Legation, and Interpreters, shall, after June 30,
1884, be the salary of each officer respectively, and all acts or
parts of acts inconsistent or in conflict therewith, or which llow a larger salary to any officer or employe herein named,
shall be, and are hereby, repealed." Congressional Record,

48th Cong. 1st Sess., part 4, p. 4194. This paragraph was
omitted from the act as passed.
The claimant was paid at the rate of $7500 a year up to and
including June 30, 1882, and for the balance of his term at the
rate only of $5000 a year. He brought this suit to recover the
difference between those am.ounts for the period from June 30,
1882 to July 24, 1885. His claim was sustained in the court
below, and judgment was rendered in his behalf for $7666.66.
This case is distinguishable from United States v. Fisher, 109
U. 9. 143, 146, and United States v. .Aitcliell,109 U. S. 146, 149.
In Fisher's case it w"as held that the clause in the Revised Statutes, fixing the salary of the chief justice and associate justice of
Wyoming at $3000 per annum, was suspended by the provision in
each of the appropriation acts, for the legislative, executive, and
judicial expenses of the government for the fiscal years ending
June 30, 1879 and 1880, which declared that the sum therein
specified-among which was $2600 each to the governor, chief
justice, and two associate judges of Wyoming-were appropriated "in full compensation" for the service of those years.
The claim of Fisher for compensation, on the basis fixed by the
Revised Statutes, was consequently rejected. This court said:
"We cannot adopt the view of the appellee, unless we eliminate
from the statute the words 'in full compensation,' which Congress, abandoning the long used form of the appropriation acts,
has ex industria inserted. Our duty is to give them effect.
When Qongress has said that the sum appropriated shall be in
full compensation of the services of the appellee, we cannot say
that it shall not be in full compensation, and allow him a
greater sum."
In Mitchell's case, the claim was for compensation as an Indian interpreter under §§ 2070 and 2076 of the Revised Statutes, the first one of which declared that interpreters, Qf a certain
class, shall be paid $400 a year each, and by the second one of
which it wa3 provided that the several compensations prescribed
"shall be in full of all emoluments and allowances whatsoever.'7
During the period for which Mitchell claimed compensation,,
at that rate, he received pay at the rate of $300 per annum,
under acts appropriating various sums for interpreters, includ-

Opinion of the Court.

ing seven interpreters for the Indian tribes among whom Mitchell was assigned to duty, "at $300 per annum, $2100." 19 Stat.
271. In those acts there was also a clause to this effect: "For
additional pay of said interpreters, to be distributed in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, $6000." It was held
that these acts manifested a change of policy upon the part of
Congress, "namely, that instead of establishing a salary for interpreters at a fixed amount, and cutting off all other emoluments and allowances, Congress intended to reduce the salaries,
and place a fund at the disposal of the Secretary of the Inte.
rior from which, at his discretion, additional emoluments and
allowances might be given to the interpreters." The appropriation by those acts of a fixed sum as compensation for certain
interpreters during a prescribed period, followed by the appropriation of a round sum as additional pay, to be distributed
among them in the discretion of one of the Executive Departments, evinced the intention of Congress not to allow further
compensation to such appointees during the periods specified.'
The case before us does not come within the principle that
controlled the determination of the other cases. The salary of
the Minister to Hayti was originally fixed at the sum of $7500,
Neither of the acts appropriating $5000 for his benefit, during
the fiscal years in question, contains any language to the effect
that such sum shall be "in full compensation" for those years;
nor was there in either of them an appropriation of money "for
additional pay," from which it might be inferred that Congress
intendedl to repeal the act fixing his annual salary at $7500.
Repeals by implication are not favored. It cannot be said that
there is a positive repugnancy between the old and the new,
statutes in question. If by any reasonable construction they
can be made to stand together, our duty is to give effect to the
provisions of each. ('hezjeozg v. United States, 112 U. S. 536,

85,105; E'xparte Crow Dog, 109 U. S. 556, 570. The suggestion
of most weight in support of the view that Congress intended
to reduce the salary of the diplomatic representative at Hayti,
is the improbability that that body would neglect, in any year,
to appropriate the full sum: to which that officer was entitled
