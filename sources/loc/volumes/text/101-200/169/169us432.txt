CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 88. Argued October 15, 1897. -Decided March 7, 1S98.
In August, 1880, Sackett brought suit in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, on behalf of himself and all other holders and owners of bonds
of certain railroad companies against Root, the Harlem Extension Railroad South Coal Transportation Company, the New York, Boston and
Montreal Railway Company and David Butterfield, receiver of said company, praying for the appointment of a receiver and for a sale of the railroad and franchises for the benefit of the bondholders. On October 11,
1880, a receiver was appointed and qualified. On April 2, 1881, on petition
of the receiver, and after a report by an expert disclosing the necessity
for expenditure to make the road safe and to enable trains to be run, an
order was made by the court authorizing the receiver to issue and negotiate $350,000 in certificates, the same to be a first lien. The certificates
were sold, and the proceeds expended under the approval of the court.
On June 12, 1885, sale was made of the road and deed delivered to Foster
and Hazard for $155,000, subject to the payment of the unpaid portion of
the principal and interest of the certificates. On April 9, 1886, the Central National Bank of Boston brought suit in the Supreme Court of New
York, on its own behalf and that of others as owners of the certificates,
against Foster, Hazard, the New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway
Company, and the American Loan and Trust Company. On March 24,
1887, the suit having been transferred on the petition of the defendants
to the Circuit Court of the United States, after full hearing and argument
the latter court rendered a final decree, establishing the rights of the Central National Bank of Boston and of others as owners of said certificates,
declaring the latter to be a first lien, decreeing that Foster and Hazard
were liable for any deficiency if the sale should fail to realize enough to

$7500, and on April 25, 1892, deed of conveyance by referee to Foster,
were made. On December 8, 1890, Stevens and others brought their suit
in the Supreme Court of New York against the Central National Bank of
Boston, the other holders of certificates, Foster, Hazard and others, to
set aside the decree in Sackett's case and to enjoin proceedings in the
Circuit Court of the United States. November 11,1891, judgment setting
aside the sale in Sackett's case and finally enjoining the Central National
Bank and others, plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of the United States,
from selling under the decree of the Federal court. On May 16, 1892,
sale and conveyance were made by referee under the decree in the present suit to Foster. On May 9, 1893, judgment of the general term was
rendered, and November 27, 1891, judgment of the Court of Appeals, each
affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court, H'eld that the judgment
of the Supreme Court of New York and of the Court of Appeals affirming
the same are erroneous in so far as they command the Central National
Bank of Boston, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and
other holders of the receiver's certificates whose rights, as such holders,
were adjudged by the Circuit Court of the'United States, to appear before
the referee appointed by the Supreme Court in the present case, and
which enjoin the Central National Bank of Boston and others, whose
rights have been adjudged by the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of New York, from proceeding with the sale under
the decree of that Court.
THE Lebanon Springs Railroad Company was organized in the
year 1852, and, by virtue of various acts of the legislatures of
New York and Vermont, was authorized to construct and maintain a railroad extending from Chatham, New York, to Bennington, Vermont. On the 1st day of July, 1867, the said
company duly executed and delivered to the Union Trust Company of New York a mortgage of that date on all its property,
rights and franchises, to secure the payment of bonds to the
amount of two million of dollars, which bonds were then or soon
after sold to a great number of persons. In January, 1870, the
Lebanon Springs Railroad Company consolidated with the
Bennington and Rutland Railroad Company, under the name
and style of the Harlem Extension Railroad Company. The
new company, on April 1, 1870, executed and delivered to the
said Union Trust Company a mortgage on its road and franchises to secure bonds to the amount of four million dollars:
Of these bonds there were sold to outside parties to the
amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars. The

remaining two million five hundred thousand dollars of bonds
were reserved to take up and be exchanged for the two million dollars of bonds of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company and for five hundred thousand dollars of bonds which
had been issued by the Bennington -and Rutland Railroad
Company, but such exchange never took place, and accordingly only one million five hundred thousand dollars of the
said bonds of the Harlem Extension Railroad Company were
ever issued. Both said mortgages were duly recorded in the
proper counties in the States of New York and Vermont.
On February 22, 1872, the interest upon the said bonds
of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company falling due after
January, 1869 not having been paid, the Union Trust Company of New York began an action in the Supreme Court of
New York to foreclose the mortgage of that company, in
which action the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company and the
Harlem Extension Railroad Company were made defendants.
On November 15, 18-72, the Union Trust Company of New
York filed bills in the Court of Chancery in the State of Vermont to foreclose both of said mortgages, in which actions the
Lebanon Springs Railroad Company and the Harlem Extension Railroad Company were made defendants, and said defendants duly appeared in that court prior to December 1, 1872.
While the above-mentioned actions were pending, and on
December 18, 1872, the Harlem Extension Railroad Company
and the Pine Plains and Albany Railroad Company, a corporation of the State of New York, consolidated their roads,
property and capital stock, under the name of the Harlem
Extension Railroad Company; and on December 19, 1872,
the New York, Boston and Northern Railroad Company and
the said last named the Harlem Extension Railroad Company
duly consolidated their roads, property and capital stock, and
thus formed one company under the name of the New York,
Boston and Montreal Railway Company.
The above-mentioned foreclosure suits were so proceeded
with that, in the said action in the Supreme Court of New
York, a judgment of foreclosure of the said mortgage given
by the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company, and for a sale of

its road, property and franchises within the State of New
York, and of all its right, title and interest to the railroad
and franchises within the State of Vermont, was rendered on
December 10, 1872; and on January 25, 1873, the property
and franchises mentioned were sold to one William Butler
Duncan for the price of one hundred thousand dollars, and on
said day, Charles S. Fairchild, the referee appointed by the
court to effect the sale, executed and delivered to one James
C. Hull his deed of conveyance of the said road, property and
franchises, bearing date the said 25th January, 1873, and said
deed was duly recorded in. the clerks' offices for the counties
of Rensselaer and Columbia.
On the 7th day of December, 1872, decrees of foreclosure
of the mortgage of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company
and of the Harlem Extension Railroad Company's mortgage,
and directing a sale, were rendered; and in pursuance of such
decrees the said road, property and franchises within the
State of Vermont were, by Daniel McEwen, a special master
in chancery, appointed by the court for that purpose, sold on
January 20, 1873, to one Charles G. Lincoln, for the sum of
fifty thousand dollars, and deeds of conveyance of that date
were made and delivered to said Lincoln by the said master
in chancery.
On January 28, 1873, Hull and Lincoln, the respective purchasers at the said foreclosure sales, executed and delivered
to the said William Butler Duncan and to one Trenor W.
Park a bond in the sum of five million dollars, and a mortgage to secure the same on all the roads, property and franchises of the Harlem Extension Railroad Company, including
those of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company and of the
New York and Vermont Railroad Company.
On January 30, 1873, Hull and wife, by their deed executed
and delivered that day, conveyed all said roads, property and
franchises, situated in the State of New York, to the said the
New York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company, subject,
however, to said mortgage to Duncan and Park; and, on the
same day, Lincoln, by a deed executed and delivered by him,
conveyed said roads, property and franchises, situated in the

State of Vermont, to the said the New York, Boston and
Montreal Railway Company, subject to the said mortgage to
Duncan and Park, and to the said five hundred thousand dollar mortgage on the old Bennington and Rutland Railroad.
The New York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company
paid the sum of $807,077.05 on account of the moneys due on
said bond and mortgage, which had become wholly due and
payable on or before February 1, 1875, but has never paid the
remainder of the money due on said bond and mortgage.
On March 15, 1873, the New York, Boston and Montreal
Railway Company executed and delivered a certain other
mortgage in the amount of twelve million two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars to Seligman, Sherman and Brown as
trustees. This mortgage c6vered the above-mentioned railroad and other properties. On the 1st day of April, 1873, the
New York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company executed
and delivered still another mortgage on the said railroad and
other things in the amount of twelve million seven hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, in which the New York Loan and
Indemnity Company was named as trustee. Enough of the
bonds of the said last two mortgages were sold to realize six
millions of dollars, which were received and disbursed by
Seligman and Brown. The said railroad was operated by and
on behalf of the New York, Boston and Montreal Railway
Company until some time in November, 1873, when said compptny leased the road to the Central Vermont Railroad Company, by which it was operated until August 20, 1877, when
said last-mentioned company withdrew from the possession of
and abandoned the road. In the meantime the New York,
Boston and Montreal Railway Company had failed to fulfil
its obligations and had become wholly insolvent, and said
railroad, when surrendered and abandoned by its lessee, lay
unoccupied and unoperated until some time in September,
1877, when it was taken possession of by one Russell C. Root,
who subsequently, in November, 1877, delivered possession
thereof to a corporation called the Harlem Extension Railroad South Coal Transportation Company, a corporation of
the State of New York, and of which said Root was president,

CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.

Statement of the Case.
and which continued to operate said railroad until it came into
the possession of John W. Van Valkenburgh as hereinafter
stated.
On September 7, 1889, one Marvin Sackett, claiming to be
the owner of bonds to the amount of $8700, issued, as before
mentioned, by the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company,
brought an action in the Supreme Court of New York
against the said Russell C. Root, the Harlem Extension
Railroad South Coal Transportation Company, the New
York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company and Daniel
Butterfield, as receiver of the said last-mentioned company,
praying for the sale of the whole of the said railroad property and franchises. He claimed to bring the action in
behalf of himself and all others, bondholders of the Lebanon
Springs Railroad Company, similarly situated, who held any
of the two million of dollars of the bonds of said company.
He alleged in his complaint the fact of the mortgage, to
secure his bonds, among others, to the Union Trust Company
of New York, its actions to foreclose the sales under them,
the aforesaid sales to Hull and Lincoln, and their mortgage to
-Park and Duncan, and the conveyance by the latter to the
New York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company, and that
Hull and Lincoln, and Park and Duncan, acted throughout
all those matters as the agents and representatives, and for
the use and benefit of the bondholders of the Lebanon Springs
Railroad Company.
The summons and complaints were served upon the New
York, Boston and Montreal Railway Company and upon
Butterfield as receiver, but they did not appear. Russell
C. Root and the Harlem Extension Railroad South Coal
Transportation Company were also served, and they put in
joint answers on September 25, 1880. On. October 1, 1880,
the complainant Sackett moved for the appointment of a
receiver, and on October 7, John W. Van Valkenburgh was
appointed and filed his bond as receiver.
On November 12, 1880, one Bloodgood and six others,
claiming to own a majority of the bonds of the Lebanon
Springs Railroad Company, moved for leave to be made

parties to the action. This motion was, on January 10, 1881,
denied, but the plaintiff was directed to serve papers and
notices of every kind 6n one F. L. Westbrook, who was by
the order authorized to appear as counsel of the said Bloodgood and the other six bondholders, upon all trials, hearings
and motions. On November 6, 1880, Park and Duncan made
an application to the court to be made parties to the action,
alleging that they were the owners of over $300,000 of bonds
of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company, and of over
$600,000 of bonds of the Harlem Extension Railroad Cornpan.y, and that they were the mortgagees under the mortgage
made by Hull and Lincoln. This application was not granted.
One Henry A. Tilden, who claimed to own thirty of the bonds
of the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company, was associated
with Sackett in the bringing of said action, and appeared by
counsel. On October 11, 1880, the receiver filed a petition,
setting forth that he had no funds with which to equip or
operate the road, and asking that he might be allowed to
borrow $25,000 on certificates for that purpose, and on October 25, 1880, the court made an order authorizing the receiver
to borrow $25,000 on certificates, which were declared to be
a first lien on the net profits of the railroad company. On
February 23, 1881, the receiver filed a petition setting forth
that there were large arrears of taxes, for which sales had
taken place of portions of the road, that there was a necessity
for the purchase of rails and superstructures, and praying that
he might be authorized to issue certificates to raise the necessary moneys to redeem such portions of the road as has been
sold for taxes, and to purchase rails and make other necessary
repairs., Notice of this petition was filed on Hamilton Ward,
attorney general of the State of New York; on McClellan
and Brown, attorneys for Sackett, the plaintiff; on P. W.
Ostremder, attorney for R. C. Root, defendant, and on F. W.
Westbrook, attorney designated to receive notices on behalf
of Bloodgood and others.
On March 5, 1881, the court, after hearing Edward Newcomb, of counsel for said receiver, and F. L. Westbrook, of
counsel in opposition thereto, appointed James H. Jones, an

expert, to examine the rails, ties, bridges, roadbed, trestles,
telegraph poles and all matters pertaining to the running of
the Lebanon Springs Railroad, to the end that he should make
a report to the court of the true condition of the Lebanon
Springs Railroad, with his opinion thereon as to what was.
necessary and requisite for the protection of said property
and the safety and successful running of said railroad; that
said report be made to said receiver, and that said receiven
should return said report, together with a detailed statement
of moneys received and expended by him, with such other information as he should have in relation to said railroad; and
further directing that said reports and papers should be served
on F. L. Westbrook ten days prior to the hearing on said report before the court.
On March 19, 1881, James I. Jones made an elaborate
report to the receiver, stating that he had, in pursuance of
his appointment, made a careful examination of the said railroad, its rails, ties, bridges, roadbed, trestles, telegraph poles
and all matters appertaining to the running and management
thereof; that he found the rails of iron worn to such an extent as to render the running of trains, even at an ordinary
rate of speed, extremely dangerous; that to render the track
safe for ordinary use would require from 2500 to 3000 tons of
new rails to replace the poorer conditioned of the old ones;
that the ties were badly decayed, to replace which would
require about 87,000 new ties; that the road required. new
ballasting; that the bridges and trestles were in an unsafe
condition, all needing repair; that to repair the bridges and
trestles and abutments would require an expenditure, of some
$19,000; that new telegraph poles to the number of 2030 were
required; that, in fine, to put said road in a condition to render its operation safe and successful would require about
$320,000. This.report was returned to court by the receiver,
with a statement of his receipts and expenditures to date, and
on April 4, 1881, the court, after considering said reports and
hearing counsel for the receiver, and no one appearing in
opposition thereto, ordered the receiver to put said road, in
repair as recommended by the report of James H. Jones, and

authorized him to issue receiver's certificates, dated April 2,
1881,"with interest at six per cent, for the aggregate amount
of $350,000, the same to be signed by said John W. -Van Valkenburgh, as receiver of said Lebanon Springs Railroad Company, and a certificate on each thereof duly to be signed by
an officer of the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of New
York City. It was further ordered that the said receiver
should negotiate said certificates, and with the money arising
therefrom pay and discharge the $25,000 of certificates theretofore authorized by the order of October 25, 1880, and to
purchase all necessary materials for the repairs of said road,
and pay and discharge all necessary expenses incident to said
repairs. It was further ordered that said receiver's certificates
of indebtedness should be declared to be a debt of the receiver incurred for the benefit and protection of said Lebanon
Springs Railroad and its owners and the bondholders thereof,
and said certificates were declared and decreed to be a first
lien on the railroad and every kind of property owned by the
company, to be recdgnized as such in any reorganization of
-the company or in its consolidation with any other company;
and in case of any sale of the said railroad, the property in
the hands of the receiver, and the franchises, under any decree of the Supreme Court, the said certificates are to be first
paid from the first moneys realized thereupon by the receiver,
unless sooner paid and cancelled by him from the earnings
of the railroad; but in case said railroad and property in the
hands of the receiver and franchises, on any sale thereof, does
not bring sufficient to pay the full amount and interest then
due on the outstanding negotiated certificates, then such
unpaid amount shall remain as a first lien on the road, property and franchises in the hands of the purchaser.
On January 12, 1885, a final decree of sale was made,
appointing George McClellan as referee to make such sale,
and providing, among other things, that sale should be made
subject to the payment of the undue principal and interest of
the receiver's certificates, and that the purchaser of the railroad and franchises should take said railroad, property and
franchises, subject to the unpaid portion of said certificates,

CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.

441

Statement of the Case.

which should be assumed by such purchaser as part of the
consideration of the purchase.
On June 29, 1885, George McClellan, the referee, reported
to the court that he had effected sale, in accordance with the
terms of the decree of sale, to one William Foster, Jr., trustee,
for the sum of $155,000, and that, among the terms of the
sale, it was stipulated that William Foster, Jr., trustee, should
take the property and assets, subject to the payment of the
undue principal and interest of the receiver's certificates.
Subsequently, the referee executed and delivered to William
Foster, Jr., and Rowland N. Hazard, as purchasers, a deed of
conveyance, and received from them $155,000, the amount of
their bid ; and it appears that, out of the amount of said purchase money, there was then paid about $60,000, the interest
then due on said certificates. Afterwards, it appears by the
record, that Foster and Hazard conveyed the railroad, property and franchises to the New York, Rutland and IMontreal
Railway Company, to which company Reynolds, who had
succeeded Van Valkenburgh as receiver, surrendered possession of the railroad. The balance of the purchase money
was used and applied as directed by the judgment in the said
Sackett suit.
The principal of said certificates became due on the 1st day
of April, 1886, and was not paid. Thereupon, in the month
of April, 1866, the Central National Bank of Boston brought
an action in the Supreme Court of New York in behalf of
itself as well as other holders of receiver's certificates, against
William Foster, Jr., Rowland N. Hazard, the New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway Company and the American Loan
and Trust Company of New York. All of the defendants in
said action appeared and answered. After issue was joined,
the said action was, on the petition of the defendants, duly
removed into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of New York.
The complaint alleged in substance that the plaintiff is a
banking association duly organized and incorporated under
the laws of the United States, located and doing business in
the city of Boston, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

It alleged the making" of an order on or about April 9, 1881;
by the iNew York Supreme Court in the Sackett suit, whereby
one John W. Van Valkenburgh, as receiver of the Lebanon
Springs Railroad Company, was authorized and directed to

Statement of the Case.

the receiver and franchises on any sale thereof should not
bring sufficient to pay the fullamount of principal and interest
then due on the outstanding negotiated certificates in said
order authorized to be issued, then the purchaser of said railroad and the property in the hands of the receiver, and franchises, should assume, as a first lien thereon, so much of said
principal as at that time should remain outstanding and unpaid
with interest thereon, referring to the original order or the
record thereof.
The complaint further alleged that the said Van Valkenburgh, as receiver, under and in pursuance of said order, did
issue and negotiate such certificates of indebtedness in the
manner and form by said order provided to the amount of
$350,000, and that he duly applied the moneys received from
said certificates to the uses and purposes mentioned and in

in said judgment provided for, and whereby it was further
adjudged and decreed that the property, franchises and
rights of the said railroad company as described in a certain

all the parties to the said action, including all property and
assets in the hands of said receiver, be sold at public auction
under the direction of a referee therein named, for the benefit
of the first mortgage bondholders of said railroad company
issued July 1, 1867, for the amount of $2,000,000, and that
said sale be made subject to the payment of the undue principal and interest of the said receiver's certificates, and that
the purchaser or purchasers of said railroad property and franchises should take the said railroad property and franchises

William Foster, Jr., and Rowland 1N. Hazard, who became
the purchasers thereof for the price of $155,000, and that the
said William Foster, Jr., acting on behalf of himself and said
Hazard, did pay the referee five per cent of the purchase price
and did subscribe a certain contract of sale, which was also
subscribed by said referee, whereby, among other thiigs, he
did, for himself and said Hazard, assume and agree to pay
the amount of said principal and interest on said certificates
of indebtedness as part of the consideration of said purchase;
that the balance of said $155,000 was thereafter paid by the
purchasers to the referee, and that the referee did thereafter
duly execute and deliver to the defendants Foster and Hazard
a deed of said premises and property in said judgment described, and paid from the said $155,000 the interest then due
on said certificates, amounting to about $60,000.
Plaintiff further alleged in said complaint that said referee's

subject to the unpaid principal and interest on the receiver's
certificates, as required by the judgment aforesaid; that the
principal of said certificates with interest from January 1,
1886, became due and payable on the 2d day of April, 1886,
and that on that day the said certificates, amounting to
$250,000, held by the plaintiff, were duly presented to the
Farmers' Loan and Trust Company of the city of New York,
where the same were payable, and payment thereof was demanded, but the same was refused, and that the whole of
said principal with interest from the 1st day of January, 1886,
is now due and unpaid. The complaint then gives a description of the railroad premises mentioned in the judgment in
the Sackett suit and in the referee's deed; 4lleges that
the defendants or some of them are now in possession of the
property above described, and are using and operating the
same for railroad purposes, and that all the defendants have
or claim to have some interest in or lien upon said premises
or some part thereof, which interest or lien, if any, has accrued
subsequently to the lien of said certificates, and that there is
now justly due the plaintiff upon said certificates held by it
the sum of $250,000, with interest from January 1, 1886.
The complaint then prays that the unpaid principal and interest of said receiver's certificates may be adjudged to be a
lien upon said premises; asks for the usual judgment of foreclosure, for a receiver and for a sale, and that out of the
moneys arising from the sale of said premises, plaintiff and
other holders of said certificates who may come in and prove
their title thereto and the amount due thereon may be paid
the amount due on said certificate with interest and costs, so
far as the amount of such moneys properly applicable thereto
will pay the same, and that the defendants Hazard and Foster
may be adjudged to pay any deficiency that may remain after
applying said moneys so applicable thereto, and for general
relief.
The defendants all appeared and answered. Hazard and
Foster answered separately, admitting their purchase substantially as alleged in the complaint, controverting some of the
other allegations, and setting up as a distinct defence that

they acquired the property mentioned in the plaintiff's complaint with notice that the receiver's certificates were outstanding and of the sum justly due therefor, and that they
have ever since been and now are ready and willing to pay
the sum justly due on account of said receiver's certificates,
but that they are advised and believe that the plaintiff is not
entitled to receive payment thereof; that when the said property came into the hands of these defendants, it was subject
to a lien for the amount actually due from the receiver and
his successor in the trust for the amount of said receiver's
certificates, but for no other or greater amount; and that
these defendants when they acquired the property succeeded
to all the rights of the prior owners of the property as well as
to their obligations; that in accepting the deed of the premises,
they intended only to obligate themselves to pay the amount
actually due from the receiver on account of such certificates,
with proper interest, and no other or greater sum by way of
profit, and defendants aver that they incurred no greater or
other obligations in the premises.
The defendant the New York, Rutland and Montreal
Railway Company also put in a separate answer. It alleged,
among other things, that defendants Foster and Hazard had
conveyed and transferred to it all the property and franchises
conveyed to them by the referee in the Sackett suit subject
to the payment of the sum justly due by said receiver, but not
subject to any greater sum, and it controverts the allegations
as to the amounts due on the receiver's certificates.
The American Loan and Trust Company also answered
separately, setting up that it was the holder of a mortgage
executed to it by the New York, :Rutland and Montreal Railway Company, and denying knowledge or information as to
the matters charged in the bill.
The case came on for a hearing on pleadings and proofs, and
after full argument, on March 24, 1887, a decree was passed of
which the following is a copy (omitting the description of the
property, which is the same as that contained in the complaint
in this action):
"It was ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:

certificates appeared before the special master and made proof
of their ownership thereof, and said master, on February 7,
1888, made a report accordingly, finding the names of the
holders thereof and the amounts due them respectively.
On March 23, 1892, in pursuance of an order of sale made
by the said Circuit Court of the United States, Worthington
Frothingham, as referee, sold the said premises and property
described in the complaint (and described in the deed of
George McClellan, referee, to Foster and Hazard) to William
Foster, Jr., for the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars, and
on April 25, 1892, executed and delivered a deed therefor to
the said William Foster, Jr.
On December 8, 1890, Aaron R. Stevens, Harper W. Rogers,
Nancy E. Wilbur, Andrew A. Douglas, as trustee under the
will of W. H. Douglas, deceased, and Ida S. Harrison, for
themselves and other holders and owners of bonds issued by
the Lebanon Springs Company and the Harlem Extension
Railroad Company, filed a petition or bill of complaint in the
Supreme Court of New York against the Union Trust Company of iNew York, James C. Hull, William Butler Duncan,
John G. McCullough, as administrator of the goods, chattels
and credits of Trenor W. Park, deceased; the New York,
Boston and Montrdal Railway Company, Jesse Seligman,
John Crosby Brown, William Watts Sherman, Daniel Butterfield, as receiver of the property of the New York, Boston
and Montreal Railway Company; Marvin Sackett, Russell C.
Root, the Harlem Extension Railroad South Coal Transportation Company, the Central National Bank of Boston, Peter
Butler, as receiver of the property of the Pacific National
Bank of Boston; the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Company, and others.
In this petition there is a history of the Lebanon Springs
Railroad Company and the Harlem Extension Railroad Company, and of the several legal proceedings whereby the roads,
property and franchises of these companies became vested in
the New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway Company,
which is substantially the same with that heretofore made in
this statement. But the petition assailed the action brought

CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.

451

Statement of the Case.

by Sackett in 1880, and which resulted in the sale to Foster
and Hazard in 1885, as fraudulent and collusive, and alleged
that "the suit by Sackett was brought and conducted, not

with the intention of realizing the said property for the
benefit of the bondholders or any of them, or of himself as
bondholder, but collusively and with the intent that he and
others should receive -large sums of money from the said
property under color of the payment of claims, which, even
if valid, were subordinate to said mortgages, and with the
intent that said railroad and property should be acquired by
others free from the lien of said mortgages, and without
realizing anything to the holders of said bonds."
The petition further alleged that "afterwards the defendant, the Central National Bank of Boston, claiming to own
such certificates to the amount of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars, stated at par of the principal of the same,
brought an action in this court against the defendants Foster
and Hazard, the New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway
Company, and the American Loan and Trust Company; that
in that action the plaintiff prayed for the sale of the said railroad and property for the satisfaction of the certificates;
that said action was removed into the Circuit Court of the
United States, and such proceedings have been had therein
that a decree has passed whereby it is provided that the said
railroad and property be sold by a master of that court for
the payment of the said certificates."
The prayers for relief were as follows:
"1. That it may be adjudged that the owners of the bonds
issued by the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company have a first
lien upon the said railroad and property, and the owners of
the bonds issued by the Harlem Extension Railroad Company
a second lien thereon, in preference of all others. That the
bond and mortgage executed by the defendants Hull and
Lincoln to the defendant Duncan and the said Park is held
for the benefit of the owners of said bonds and represents
their interest solely, and that defendants Brown and Seligman
redeliver the same.
"12. That the judgment in the action brought in this court

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.

by the defendant the Union Trust Company, and the decrees
in the two actions brought by that company in the Court of
Chancery of Vermont, be now specifically enforced, and the
mortgage by the said Hull and Lincoln be now foreclosed, and
that the said railroad and property be sold under said judgments and decrees, and said mortgage of Hull and Lincoln,
for the benefit of this plaintiff and all other of the owners
of the Lebanon Springs and Harlem extension bonds, and
that all of the defendants in this action be lUarred and foreclosed of all right, title, interest and equity of redemption, of,
in and to the said railroad and property and any part of the
same.
"3. That it may be adjudged that the certificates issued by
the said Van Valkenburgh were beyond the power of this
court to issue and are of no validity except to bind the interest
represented by the eight bonds of the said Marvin Sackett,
and the interests of the defendants in the action brought by
said Sackett.
"4. That all of the defendants in this action and all other persons be enjoined, as well temporarily by order as permanently
by judgment, from interfering with any part of the said railroad or property.
"5. That a receiver be appointed, with the usual powers of
receivers, to take possession of, preserve and operate said railroad and property until further order of the court.
"6. That the plaintiffs have such other and further relief as
to the court shall seem just, besides costs."
To this petition the Central National Bank of Boston filed
its separate answer, in which, after admitting certain allegations in the petition, relative to the history of the railroad
companies, the said defendant set forth the proceedings in the
suit of Sackett, including the appointment of Van Valkenburgh as receiver, the authority given such receiver by the
court to issue and negotiate the said certificates, and the purchase by the defendant of $250,000 of said certificates for full
value. The answer further alleged, in response to the petition, that the suit was brought by Sackett for himself as
bondholder and on behalf of all other bondholders; that other

453

Statement of the Case.

bondholders, representing all, or nearly all, the bonds issued
by the Lebanon Springs Railroad Company, had knowledge
of the pendency of said suit by Sackett, and were represented
by attorneys and counsel, although not nominally made parties to the action; that Foster and Hazard became purchasers
at the sale, and that, by the terms of the sale, they had
assumed the payment of the unpaid portion of said certificates as part of the consideration of the purchase; 'and
further alleged that said judgment of the Supreme Court of
INew York had never been appealed from, reversed or in any
way vacated or modified, and was binding and conclusive, not
only upon the parties to said action, but upon the other
holders of said bonds issued by the Lebanon Springs Railroad
Company. The answer then proceeded to set forth proceedings in the Circuit Court of the United States, including the
decree of March 24, 1887, and to pray, among other things,
that the petition should be dismissed upon the merits, and
that a decree may be rendered recognizing the rights of the
defendant the Central National Bank of Boston as a holder of
said certificates as such rights had been theretofore established
by the decree of the Circuit Court of the United States.
The American Loan and Trust Company filed its separate
answer, admitting some and denying other allegations of the
petition. Hazard and Foster also filed a separate answer on
their own behalf, in which they allege that the Sackett suit
was brought and pursued in behalf of all the bondholders;
that they, Foster and Hazard, had purchased the railroad
property and franchises in good faith, and that by the judgment, decree and sale in said suit all the rights of said bondholders, plaintiffs in this suit, were cut off and barred, and
that they, Foster and Hazard, had thereby acquired a good
and valid title to said property and franchises, and thereupon
they prayed that the complaint be dismissed and that a decree
be rendered establishing their rights as purchasers of said road
under said judgment and decree.
The New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway Company
likewise filed a separate answer, denying the principal allegations of the petition, and praying that the rights of said com-

Statement of the Case.

pany as purchaser of said road from Foster and Hazard should
be confirmed, and that the complaint be dismissed.
Certain other individual defendants, holders of receiver's
certificates, likewise answered, denying these allegations of the
petition which assailed the validity of the proceedings in the
Sackett suit, and praying that the said petition should be dismissed. Separate answers were likewise filed by Seligman
and Brown, and by William B. Duncan substantially to the
same effect.
Upon the first trial of this action judgment was rendered in
favor of the defendants, dismissing it on the merits. On appeal that judgment was reversed by the general term and a
new trial ordered. Stevens v. Union Trust Co., 57 Hun, 498.
At the new trial judgment was rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs on November 10, 1891, and this judgment, having
been affirmed by the general term, was taken on appeal to the
Court of Appeals, whose judgment, rendered November 27,
1894, affirmed that of the court below. Stevens v. Central.at.
Bankl, 144 N. Y. 50. This writ of error was then sued out.
Upon sale made by John L. Henning, as referee, under the
judgment of the Supreme Court in this case, pending the appeals, there was executed and delivered to said William Foster,
Jr., by said referee a deed of conveyance of the railroad,
property and franchises, dated May 16, 1892; and, as already
stated, on March 23, 1892, the railroad was sold and conveyed
to William Foster, Jr., by the referee appointed by the decree
of the United States court.
After the judgment of November 10, 1891, William Foster,
Jr., brought an action in the Supreme Court of New York
against the Central National Bank and other holders of certificates, seeking to set aside that portion of the decree of the
United States Circuit Court of March 24, 1887, which adjudged that Foster, either alone or with Hazard, pay the Central Bank and other certificate holders the deficiency that
might exist in the payment of the certificates after the application of the proceeds of the sale of the road, and to annul and
enjoin the decree that execution issue for such deficiency; and
that this action, so brought by Foster, has been removed, on

Mr. JUSTICE SHMns, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The plaintiffs in error ask us to reverse the decree of the
Court of Appeals, affirming that of the Supreme Court of
New York, because the action of Stevens and others as a bill
of review, or a bill in the nature of a bill of review, was not
brought within the time limited by the practice of the courts
for entertaining such bills; that, under the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York, bills for review have no
place for errors appearing upon the face of the record; that
the only remedy for such errors is by appeal; that, in so far
as it is contended that the decree in the Sackett case was obtained by a fraudulent assertion or suppression of facts, the
party aggrieved must move promptly upon the discovery of
the fraud or of new facts; that the bill and the evidence adduced to sustain it do not disclose such a case of fraud or of
newly discovered evidence, but do show a case free from actual
fraud, and only, at the most, irregular' by reason of a failure
to include all the proper parties; that the parties complainant
are to be visited with a knowledge of the proceedings in the
Sackett suit by reason of the protracted and notorious character of the proceedings, and because knowledge of the proceedings in the Sackett suit must further be imputed to them, because they are represented in the effort to impugn the validity
of that decree by counsel who had appeared for Sackett in his
suit; and that hence the present suit should, on the well-estab-

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

lished rules regulating bills of review and bills to impeach
decrees on the ground of after-discovered evidence, have been
dismissed.
Without expressing any opinion on such allegations of error,
it is sufficient to say that they raised questions for the consideration of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York,
and that the disposition made of them by that court is binding
upon us.
But those assignments of error which allege that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and of
the Court of Appeals in affirming it erred in failing to give
proper effect to the decree of the Circuit Court of the United
States, and in granting a final injunction restraining the
appellants from availing themselves of the provisions of such
decree, certainly do present questions which are within our
jurisdiction to consider.
Referring to the previous somewhat extended statement of
the facts, we may briefly recapitulate a few of the principal
dates. In August, 1880, Marvin Sackett brought his suit in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, on behalf of
himself and all other holders and owners of bonds of certain
railroad companies against Root, the Harlem Extension Railroad South Coal Transportation Company, the New York,
Boston and Montreal Railway Company and David Butterfield, receiver of said company, praying for the appointment
of a receiver and for a sale of the railroad and franchises for
the benefit of the bondholders. On October 11, 1880, a receiver was appointed and qualified.
On April 2, 1881, on petition of the receiver, and after a
report by an expert disclosing the necessity for expenditure
to make the road safe and to enable trains to be run, an order
was made by the court authorizing the receiver to issue and
negotiate $350,000 in certificates, the same to be a first lien.
The certificates were sold, and the proceeds expended under
the approval of the court. On June 12, 1885, sale was made
of the road and deed delivered to Foster and Hazard for
$155,000, subject to the payment of the unpaid portion of the
principal and interest of the certificates.

CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.

457

Opinion of the Court.

On April 9, 1886, the Central National Bank of Boston
brought suit in the Supreme Court of New York, on its own
behalf and that of others as owners of the certificates, against
Foster, Hazard, the New York, Rutland and Montreal Railway Company and the American Loan and Trust Company.
On March 24, 1887, the suit having been transferred on the
petition of the defendants to the Circuit Court of the United
States, after full hearing and argument the latter court rendered a final decree, establishing the rights of the Central
National Bank of Boston and of others as owners of said
certificates, declaring the latter to be a first lien, decreeing that
Foster and Hazard were liable for any deficiency if sale should
fail to realize enough to pay certificates. On March 23, 1892,
sale under said decree to Foster for $7500, and on April 25,
1892, deed of conveyance by referee to Foster. On December 8, 1S90, Stevens and others brought their suit in the
Supreme Court of New York against the Central National
Bank of Boston, the other holders of certificates, Foster,
Hazard and others, to set aside decree in case of Sackett and
to enjoin proceedings in the Circuit Court of the United States.
On November 11, 1891, judgment setting aside sale in the
case of Sackett and finally enjoining, the Central National
Bank of Boston and others, plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of
the United States, from selling under the decree of the Federal court.
On May 16, 1892, sale and conveyance were made by
referee under the decree in the present suit to Foster. On
May 9, 1893, judgment of the general term, and November
27, 1891, judgment of the Court of Appeals was rendered,
affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court.
It will be perceived, on an inspection of these dates, that
when the present suit was brought a final judgment had been
rendered in the Circuit Court of the United States, establishing the title and rights of the holders of the certificates, directing a sale by a referee, and adjudging the personal liability of
Foster and Hazard for an unpaid portion of said certificates
after the application of the proceeds of sale; that when the
judgment of the Supreme Court was entered in the present

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

case, and without awaiting the result of the appeal to the
Court of Appeals, a sale was had in which Foster became the
purchaser on a bid of $7500; and that Foster was likewise
the purchaser at the sale on the decree of the Circuit Court.
The record does not disclose what application was made of
the purchase money paid by Foster on his respective purchases
at the two sales, but it may be easily conjectured that, after
the payment of the costs and of the expenses of the sales, little
or nothing would be left applicable to the bonds and certificates. Thus the singular result, thus far reached, of this protracted and expensive litigation, is that Foster, who had with
Hazard been the purchaser at the Sackett sale, has become the
owner of the railroad upon the payment of a merely nominal
sum, and that the bondholders and the owners of the certificates have realized nothing. And it further thus appears that
ever since May 16, 1892, the controversy has really been between the holders of the receiver's certificates and Foster who
has, for a trifling sum, become the owner of the railroad as
improved by money procured by the sale of the certificates.
It may be that Foster, when he bought under the decree of
sale in the present suit, did so in pursuance of some arrangement with the bondholders and as their trustee. But whether
Foster, when he bought under the decree of the Circuit Court
of the United States, subjected himself to that feature of the
decree that made him personally liable for the unpaid portion
of the certificates, and precluded himself from relying on
the decree of the Supreme Court of New York setting aside
the Sackett sale, and whether the setting aside the sale in the
Sackett suit would invalidate receiver's certificates issued years
before and whose proceeds had gone into the improvement of
the property, and whether, in case of Foster's inability to respond to his personal obligation, the unpaid portion of the
certificates would be a lien on the railroad in his hands and
those of his vendees, are questions for the Circuit Court of the
United States, which cannot be withdrawn from its determination by the subsequent proceedings in the Supreme Court of
New York. Any confusion that might otherwise have arisen
by reason of conflicting views between the Federal and state

CENTRAL NATIONAL BANK v. STEVENS.
Opinion of the Court.

courts has been prevented by the fact that Foster, who himself originally invoked the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of
the United States, has become the purchaser of the railroad
under the decrees of both courts, whereby the only substantial controversy that remains is between him, as such purchaser, and the holders of the certificates.
Those portions of the decree of the Supreme Court of New
York and of the Court of Appeals which sought to compel the
complainants in the suit pending in the Circuit Court of the
United States to come into the state court and to there relitigate their titles to the certificates and the amounts thereof,
and which sought to restrain them by injunction from proceeding under the final decree of sale of the Circuit Court, and
from enforcing the other remedies adjudged to them by that
decree, were, in our opinion, erroneous. Due effect was not
thereby given to the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court,
at least in so far as that decree bad established the ownership
and amounts of the certificates, and the injunction was a plain
interference with the proceedings in another court which had
full and complete jurisdiction over the parties and the subjectmatter of the suit, and which jurisdiction had attached long
before the suit in the Supreme Court had been begun.
It will suffice to cite a few of the cases:
"It is a doctrine of law too long established to require a
citation of authorities, that, where a court has jurisdiction, it
has a right to decide every question which occurs in the cause,
and whether its decision be correct or otherwise, its judgment,
till reversed, is regarded as binding in every other court; and
that, where the jurisdiction of a court and the right of a plaintiff to prosecute his suit in it, have once attached, that right
cannot be arrested or taken away by proceedings in another
court. These rules have their foundation, not merely in
comity, but on necessity. For if one may enjoin, the other
may retort by injunction, and thus the parties be without
remedy; being liable to a process for contempt in one if they
dare to proceed in the other. Neither can one take property
from the custody of the other by replevin or any other
process, for this would produce a conflict extremely em-

barrassing to the administration of justice. In the case of
JKennedy v. T/e Earl of Cassilis, Lord Eldon at one time
granted an injunction to restrain a party from proceeding in
a suit pending in the Court of Sessions of Scotland, which, on
more mature reflection, he dissolved; because it was admitted,
if the Court of Chancery could in that way restrain proceedings in an independent foreign tribunal, the Court of Sessions
might equally enjoin the parties from proceeding in chancery,
and thus they would be unable to proceed in either court.
The fact, therefore, that an injunction issues only to the parties before the court and not to the court, is no evasion of
the difficulties that are the necessary result of an attempt to
exercise that power over a party who is a litigant in another
and independent forum."
Peche v. Jenness, per Mr. Justice
Grier, 7 How. 612, 624.
"State courts are exempt from all interference by the
Federal tribunals, but they are destitute of all power to
restrain either the process or proceedings in the national
courts. Circuit Courts and state courts act separately and
independently of each other, and in their respective spheres
of action the process issued by the one is as far beyond the
reach of the other as if the line of division between them ' was
traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye.' Appellate relations exist in a class of cases between the state
courts and this court, but there are no such relations between
the state courts and the Circuit Courts. Viewed in any light,
therefore, it is obvious that the injunction of a state court is
inoperative to control, or in any manner to affect, the process
or proceedings of a Circuit Court, not on account of any paramount jurisdiction in the latter courts, but because in their
sphere of action Circuit Courts are wholly independent of
the state tribunals." R~iggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166.

is, that state courts cannot enjoin proceedings in the courts of
the United States; nor the latter in the former courts."
It is contended by the counsel for the defendants in error,
in a supplemental brief that these principles, so long and so
well settled, have been modified by some recent decisions of
this court and the case of -Moran v. Sturges, 154 U. S. 256,
and of Shields v. Coleman, 157 U. S. 168, are cited in support
of that contention. Such a conception of the import of those
cases must have been formed from a hasty reading, for they
are in perfect harmony with the previous cases, and, indeed,
may properly be cited to sustain the reasoning upon which
those cases proceeded.
In .Moran v. Sturges, the Chief Justice, delivering the
opinion of the court, cited the cases hereinbefore referred to
and others, and stated the general rule to be that state courts
cannot enjoin proceedings in the courts of the United States.
In that case the Supreme Court of the State of New York
had issued process against certain libellants in the District
Court of the United States, and had, after hearing, enjoined
them from taldng any further proceedings on their libels.
This judgment of the Supreme Court being affirmed by the
Court of Appeals, and the judgment of the latter court being
remitted to the Supreme Court and entered there as its judgment, the libellants sued out a writ of error to this court, and
it was here held that the state court had no jurisdiction in
.personamover the libellants as holders of maritime liens when
the libels were filed; that the question of jurisdiction was one
for the District Court to decide in the first instance; that the
District Court had jurisdiction; and that the judgment under

Opinion of the Court.

review was in effect an unlawful interference with the proceedings in that court.
It is true, as the report of the case shows, that two of the
judges dissented, but not because of any disapproval of the
principles laid down by the court, but because it was thought
that the possession of the vessels in question had vested in
the state court before the libels were filed in the District
Court.
In Sields v. Coleman there was a controversy for possession of certain railroad property, and it was held that a Circuit
Court of the United States has not the power to appoint a
receiver of property already in the possession of a receiver
duly and previously appointed by a state court, and cannot
rightfully take the property out of the hands of the receiver
so appointed by the state court. Such a decision, it is scarcely
necessary to say, gives no support to the contention of the
appellees.
The reasoning of the Court of Appeals, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New York, does not seem to
us to comport with the law as established by the decisions of
this court. It is claimed by the learned judge, who delivered
the opinion of that court, that the rule is that "although the
courts of one country have no authority to stay proceedings
in the courts of another, they have undoubted authority to
control all persons and things within their own territorial
limits. When, therefore, both parties to a suit in a foreign
country are residents within the territorial limits of another
country, the courts of equity in the latter may act in personar, upon those parties and direct them, by injunction, to
proceed no further in such suit. In such a case these courts
act upon acknowledged principles of public law in regard to
jurisdiction. They do not pretend to direct or control the
foreign court, but, without regard to the situation of the
subject-matter of the dispute, they consider the equities between the parties, and decree inpersonam,according to those
equities and enforce obedience to their decrees by process
in personam."
This language is quoted from Story's Eq. Jur. § 899; but

Opinion of the Court.
the learned judge overlooked the passage immediately following, and hereinbefore quoted: " There is one -exception to
this doctrine which has been long recognized in America, and
that is that the state courts cannot enjoin proceedings in the
courts of the United States, nor the latter in the former
courts. This exception proceeds upon peculiar grounds of
municipal and constitutional law, the respective courts being
entirely competent to administer full relief in the suits pending therein." Nor did the decision of this court in Pecke v.
Jenness, already cited, receive attention, wherein it was said,
after adverting to the proposed distinction between enjoining
a court and enjoining suitors therein, "The fact that an injunction issues only to the parties before the court and not to the
court is no evasion of the difficulties that are the necessary
result of an attempt to exercise that power over a party who
is a litigant in another and independent forum."
Nor are we able to acquiesce in the reasoning of the learned
judge when he say that " the setting aside of the judgment
in the Sackett suit upon which the suit in the United States
Circuit Court was founded, for fraud, was a newfact, occurring since the decree in that court, which gave jurisdiction in
this action to enjoin proceedings thereon." Doubtless there
may be facts occurring after the rendition of a judgment
which would render its enforcement inequitable; such, for
instance, as payment, or a reversal thereof on appeal by a superior court. But surely a judgment and injunction rendered
subsequently in another and independent forum cannot constitute such new facts unless we are prepared to concede that, as
between two courts of concurrent jurisdiction, it is the judgment of the court whose jurisdiction is last invoked which
shall be entitled to prevail. This view does not overlook the
decision of this court in .2farshall v. hUolmes, 141 U. S. 589,
where it was held that a Circuit Court of the United States,
in the exercise of its equity powers, and where diverse citizenship gives jurisdiction over the parties, may deprive a party
of the benefit of a judgment fraudulently obtained by him in
a state court, if the circumstances are such as would authorize
relief by a Federal court if the judgment had been rendered

by it and not by a state court. There the suit to restrain
the owner of the judgment from enforcing it was brought in
the state court that had rendered the judgment, and was removed into the Federal court on the ground of diverse citizenship, and it was sought to impeach the judgment for the fraud
of the party who procured it. In the present case, no fraud of
any kind is imputed to the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of
the United States, nor is it alleged that the action or proceedings in that court were founded in any mistake of facts, or
were influenced by any misrepresentation or fraud practised
upon the court. But the purpose of this suit was to practically nullify the proceedings in the Circuit Court, and to
enjoin the suitors therein from pursuing their remedy in that
court, not for any fraud of theirs used in promoting their
cause, but for the alleged fraud of other parties in another
court, and in a case in which these appellants were not
parties.
It is claimed in the brief for the defendants in error that
whatever may be the rule in ordinary cases there is no necessity in the present case for modifying the decree of the state
court, and we are pointed to the statement in the opinion of
the Court of Appeals, that 1i there is nothing in the judgment
at bar that attacks the jurisdiction of the United States Circuit
Court or questions the legality of its decree." We must suppose this language to mean that to enjoin the plaintiffs from
proceeding to enforce the decree did not affect the legality or
efficacy of the decree. Such must have been the meaning of
the learned judge, because he proceeds to assert that "it is
clear, both upon principle and authority, that this power [to
enjoin the certificate holders] did exist, and that the sale
under the decree of the United States court was without force
or effect as to the parties to that suit, as they proceeded in
Yiolation of the injunction contained in the judgment at bar."
But it has been frequently determined by this court that
the jurisdiction of a court is not exhausted by the rendition
of the judgment, but continues until the judgment shall be
satisfied. Thus it was said in Biggs v. Johnson County, 6
Wall. 166, that "process subsequent to judgment, is as essen-

tial to jurisdiction as process antecedent, else the judicial
power would be incomplete and entirely inadequate to the
purposes for which it was conferred by the Constitution."
And in Amy v. Supervisors, 11 Wall, 136, it was said: "The
two sets of tribunals-state and national-are as independent as they are separate. Neither can impede or arrest any
action the other may take, within the limits of its jurisdiction,
for the satisfaction of its judgment and decrees."
"An execution is the end of the law. It gives the successful party the fruits of his judgment." UnitedStates v. -Ylourse,
9 Pet. 8, 28. But it is scarcely necessary to quote authorities
to show that to deprive a court of the power to execute its
decrees is to essentially impair its jurisdiction. "Juris efeetus in executione consistit." Co. Litt. 289.
The conclusions we have reached are that the judgment of
the Supreme Court of New York and of the Court of Appeals
affirming the same are erroneous in so far as they command
the Central National Bank of Boston, the Massachusetts
Mutual Life Insurance Company and other holders of the
receiver's certificates whose rights, as such holders, were adjudged by the Circuit Court of the United States, to appear
before the referee appointed by the Supreme Court in the
present case, and which enjoin the Central National Bank of
Boston and others, whose rights have been adjudged by the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District'
of New York, from proceeding with the sale under the decree
of that court.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Yew York and of
the Courtof Appeals, in these particulars,are accordingly
reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court forfurther proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this
court.
