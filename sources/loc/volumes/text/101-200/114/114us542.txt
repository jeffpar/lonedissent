grant by the Legislat~ire of the State. Such cession is really
as much for the benefit of the State as it is for the benefit of
the United States. It is necessarily temporary, to be exercised
only so long as the places continue to be used for the public
purposes for which the property was acquired or reserved from
sale. When they cease to be thus used, the jurisdiction reverts
to the State.
The Military Reservation of Fort Leavenworth was not, as
already said, acquired by purchase with the consent of Kansas.
And her cession of jurisdiction is not of exclusive legislative
authority over the land, except so far as that may be necessary
for its use as-a military post; and it is not contended that the
saving clause in the act of cession interferes with such use.
There is, therefore, no constitutional prohibition against the
enforcement of that clause. The right of the State to subject
the railroad property to taxation exists as before the cession.
The invalidity of the tax levied not being asserted on any
other ground than the supposed exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States over the reservation notwithstanding the saving
clause, the judgment of the court below must be

The general principle that when political jurisdiction and legislative power
over a territory are transferred from one sovereign to another, the municipal
laws of the territory continue in force until abrogated by the new sovereign,
is applicable-as to territory owned by the United States, the exclusive jurisdiction of which is ceded to them by a State in a manner not provided for
by the Constitution-to so much thereof as is not used by the United States
for its forts, buildings and other needful public purposes..

This case comes here from the Supreme Court of the State
of Ransas. It is an action for the value:of a cow alleged to
have been killed by the engine aud cars of the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railway Company, a corporation doing
business in the County of Leavenworth, in that State. Itwas
brought in a Stite District Court, and submitted for decision
upon an agreed statement of facts, in substance as follows:
That on the 10th'of February, 1881, a cow, the property of
the plaintiff, of the value of $25, strayed upon the railroad of
the defendant at a point within the limits of the Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation in that county and State, where
the road was not enclosed with a fence, and was there struck
and killed by a train passing along the road; that the Reservationls the one referred to in the dct of the Legislature of
the State of February 22, 1875; that a demand upon the defendant for the $25 was made by the plaintiff more than thirty
days-before the action ivas brought; and that, if the plaintiff
was entitled to recover attorney's fees, $20 would be a reasonable fee.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

The action was founded upon a statute of Kansas of March
9, 1S74, entitled "An Act relating to killing or wounding stock
by railroads," which makes every railway company in the
State liable to the owner for the full value of cattle killed, and
in damages for cattle wounded, by its engine or cars, or in any
other manner in operating its railway. It provides that, in
case the railway company fails for thirty days after demand
by the owner to pay to him the full value of the animal killed,
or damages for the animal wounded, he may sue and recover
the same, together with a reasonable attorney's fee for the prosecution of the action. It further 1 rovides that it shall not
apply to any railway company, the road of which is enclosed
with a good and lawful fence to prevent the animal from being
on the road. Laws of Kansas, 1874, ch. 94.
On the 22d of February, 1875, the Legislature of Kansas
passed .an act ceding to the United States jurisdiction over the
Reservation, the first section of which is as follows: "That
exclusive jurisdiction be, and the same is hereby, ceded to the
United States over and within all the territory owned by the
United States, and included within the limits of the United
States Military Reservation, known as the Fort Leavenworth
Reservation, in said State, as declared from time to time by the
President of the United States; saving, however, to the said
State the right to serve civil or criminal process within said
Reservation, in suits or prosecutions for or on account of rights
acquired, obligations incurred, or crimes committed in said
State, but outside of such cession and Reservation; and saving
further to said State the right to tax railroad, bridge, and other
corporations, their franchises and property on said Reservation." Laws of Kansas, 1875, ch. 66.
The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, assessing
his damages at $45, an amount which was made by estimating
the value of the cow killed at $25, and the attorney's fee at
$20, these sums having been agreed upon by the parties. The
case was carried to the Supreme Court of the State, where the
judgment was affirmed, that court hbolding that the act of Kansas, relating to the killing or wounding of stock by railroads,
continued to be operative within the limits of the Reservation,

as it had not been abrogated by Congress, and was not inconsistent with existing laws of the-United States. In so holding
the court assun~ed, for the purposes of the case, without however admdting the fact, that the ict ceding jurisdiction to the
United States over the Reservation was valid, and that the
United States had legally accepted the cession. To review this
judgment the case is brought here.
Two questions.are presented for our determination; one,whether the act of Kan;sas purporting to cede to the United
States exclusive jurisdiction over the Reservation is a valid cesslon within the requirements of the constitution; the other, if
such cession of jurisdiction is valid,*did the act of Kansas relating to the killing or wounding of stock by railroads continue in
force afterwards within the limits of the Reservation?
it can hardly be the design of counsel for the railroad company to contend that the act of cession to the United States is
wholly invalid, for, in that event, the jurisdiction of the State
would remain unimpaired, and her statute would be enforceable,
within the limits of the Reservation equally as in any other
part of the State. What we suppose counsel desires to maintain-is, that the act of cession confers exclusive jurisdiction
over the territory, and that any limitations upon it in the act
must therefore be rejected as repugnant to the grant.
This point was involved in the case of Fort Zeavenworth
.Railrocdv. Lowe, ante, 525. We there held, that a building on
a tract of land owned by the United States used as a fort,,
or for other public purposes of the federal government, is.
exempted, as an instrumentality of the government, from any
such control or interference by the State as will defeat or
embarrass 'its effective 'se for those purposes. But, in order
that the United States may possess exclusive legislative power
over the tract, except as may be necessary to the use of the
building thereon as such instrumentality, they must have acquired the tract by purchase, with the consent of the State.
This is the only mWde prescribed by the Federal Constitution
for their acquisitibnv of ekclusive legislative power over it.
When such legislative power is acquired in any other way, as
by an express act ceding it, its cession may be accompanied

Opinion of the Court.

with any conditions not inconsistent with the effective use of
the property for the public purposes intended. We also held
that it is competent for the Legislature of a State to cede exclusive jurisdiction over places needed by the general government in the execution of its powers, the use of the places being,
in fact, as much for the people of the State as for the people
of the United States generally, and such jurisdiction necessarily
ending when the places cease to be used for those purposes.
Upon the second question the contention of the railroad
company is that the act of Kansas became inoperative within
the Reservation upon the cession to the United states of exclusive jurisdiction over it. We are clear that this contention
cannot be maintained. It is a general rule of public law, recognized and acted upon by the United States, that whenever
political jurisdiction and legislative power over any territory
are transferred from one nation or sovereign to another, the
municipal laws of the country, that is, laws which are intended
for the protection of private rights, continue in force until abrogated or changed by the new government or sovereign. By
the cession public property passes from one government to the
other, but private property remains as before, and with it those
municipal laws which are designed to secure its peaceful use
and enjoyment. As a matter of course, all laws, ordinances, and
regulations in conflict with the political character, institutions,
and constitution of the new government are at once displaced.
Thus, upon a cession of. political jurisdiction and legislative
power-and the latter is involved in the former-to the United
States, the laws of the country in support of an established
religion, or abridging the freedom of the press, or authorizing
cruel and unusual punishments, and the like, would at once
cease to be of obligatory force without any declaration to that
effect; and the laws of the country on other subjects would
necessarily be superseded by existing laws of the new government upon the same matters. But with respect to other laws
affecting the possession, use and transfer of property, and designed to secure good order and peace in the community, and
promote its health and prosperity, which are.strictly of a municipal character, the rule is general, that a change of govern-

ment leaves them in force until, by direct action of the new government, they are altered or repealed. American Insurance Co.
v. Canter,1 Pet. 542; Halleck, International Law, ch. 34, § 14.
The counsel for the railroad company does not controvert
this general rule in cases of cession of political jurisdiction by
one nation to another, but contends that it has no application
tQ a mere cession of jurisdiction over a small piece of territory
having no organized government or municipality within, its
limits; and argues upon. the assumption that there was no
organized government within the limits of Fort Leavenworth.
In this assumption he is mistaken. The government of the
State of Kansas extended over the Reservation, and its legislation was operative therein, except so far as the use of -the land
as an instrumentality of the general government may have
excepted it from such legislation. In other respects, the law
of the State prevailed. There was a railroad running through
it wfien the State ceded jurisdiction to the United States. The
law of the State, making the railroad liable for killing or
wounding cattle hy its cars and engines where it had no fence
to keep such cattle off the road, was as necessary to the safety
of cattle after the cession as -before, and'was no more abrogated by the mere fact of cession than regulations.as to the
crossing of highways by the railroad cars, and the ringing of
bells as a warning to others of their approach.
It is true there is a wide difference between a cession of
.political jurisdiction from one nation to another and a cession
to the United Stdtes by a State of legislative power over a
aticular tract, for'a special purpose of the general governiment; but the principle which controls as to laws in existence
at the time is the same in both. The liability of the railroad
coinpany for the killing of the cow did not depend upon the
place where the animal was killed, but upon the neglect of the
company to enclose the road with a fence which would have
prevented the cow from straying upon it. The law of Kansas
on the subject, in. our opinion, reigained in force after 'the
cession, it being in no respect inconsistent with any law of the
United States, and never having beeli changed or abrogated.
The judgment is accordingly
Affirmed.
