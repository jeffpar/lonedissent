HALFERTY v. WLMERING.
Syllabus.

MATTOON v. McGREW.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUM.IA.
Argued November 23,1894.-Decided December 15,184.

Ritz v. NationaZ MetropolitanBank, 111 U. S. 722, was decided, after elaborate
argument and careful consideration, and is adhered to by the court.

-Yr.S. S. Hfenile for appellant.
3fr. Leigh Robinson and -Yr. James Lowndes for appellee.
Mn. CHIEF JUSTICE W&TE delivered the opinion of the court.

A motion has been made to dismiss this appeal because the
value of the matter in dispute does not exceed $2,500. From
the facts appearing in the record, supplemented as they have
been by affidavits as to value, we are satisfied this motion
should be overruled, and it is so ordered.
It is conceded in the brief filed for the appellee "1that the
essential facts in this case are substantially like those in Hfitz v.
The .Yational Xetropoltan Bank 111 U. S. 722." That case
was decided on full consideration after an elaborate argument
on both sides, and we are satisfied with the conclusion then
reached. We therefore reverse this decree, on that authority,
and remand the cause, with instructions to enter a decree in
accordance with the prayer of the bill, enjoining the appellee
McGrew from selling, or attempting to sell, the marital right
or interest of the husband of the appellant in the property
described in the bill for the paymeht of his judgment against
the husband.
