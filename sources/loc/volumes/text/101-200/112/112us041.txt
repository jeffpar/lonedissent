as to the proportions in which they are to share the proceeds
of his collections, the dispute will be among 'themselves and
not with him. le cannot act upon separate-instructions from
the several creditors. Hs duty is to collect the tax for the
benefit of all alike. A payment of the judgment of one
creditor would not relieve him from his obligation to collect the
whole tax. The object of the proceeding is, not to raise the
sums due the relators, but to raise the whole tax of ten mills
on the dollar. As the matter stands, each relator has the right
to have the whole tax collected for the purpose of distribution
among all the creditors. It is apparent, therefore, that the
dispute is between the tax collector on one side and all the
creditors on the other, as to his duty to collect the tax as a
whole for division among them, after the collection is made,
according.to their several shares. The value of the matter in
dispute is measured by the whole amount of the tax, and not
by the separate parts into which it is to be divided when collected. It is conceded that the amount of the tax is more
than $5,000.
T~e Twtion to dismiss is overfzled.

MELLEN v. WALLACH.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREMIE COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Argued Apr! 24, 18.-Decided NovembQ- 3,1884.

Under a deed of trust to secure 31., covering land in the District of Columbia,
owned by B. and W., as tenants in common, the land was sold to B., in
1873. The amount secured by the deed was $5,000 of principal and
$2,429.02 interest, expenses and taxes. The sale was for enough to pay all
this and leave a sum due to W. for her share of the surplus. The terms of
sale were not carried out, but M. advanced to B. $3,200 more (out of which
the $2,429.02 was paid), and took a deed of trust for $8,200, which was
recorded as a first lien. A deed of trust to secure the amount going to W.
was recorded as a second lien, but.was never accepted by W. Litigation
afterwards ensued, to which M and B. and W. were parties, and in which
a sale of the land was ordered and made in 1881, and -. bought it, for a
sum not sufficient to pay the 7,429.02, with interest, and the subsequent

taxes on the land. W. claimed priority out of the purchase money for her
share of the surplus on the sale of 1873, and M. claimed the right to set off
against the purchasemoney enough of her claim for the $7,429.02, and
interest, and the subsequent taxes, to absorb it: Held, that the parties had
abandoned the sale of 1873, and that the sale of 1880 must be regarded as a
sale to enforce the original deed of trust to secure M., and that NV. had no
right to any of the proceeds of the sale of 1880.

The facts which make the case axe stated in the opinion of
the court.

IBLATCHFoD delivered the opinion of the court.
Mrs. Susan L. Wallach, the wife of Charles L. Wallach, and
M rs. Catharine lBurche, the wife of Raymond W. Burche, sisters, and owners, as tenants in vommon, of land and buildings
on the northwest corner of 6th street west and D street north,
in the city'of Washington, joined with their husbands, on
January 15th, 1872, in the execution to Joseph C.G. Kennedy,
of a deed of trust of that property to secure the payment to
Mrs. Rebecca R. Mellen, of a joint and several promissory note
for $5,000, made by the grantors, payable at the end of five
years from that date, with interest, at the rate of 10 per cent.
per annum, payable in quarterly instalments. The deed provided that the trustee might, on default, sell the property, at
public sale, to the highest bidder, on such terms and conditions
as he might deem most for the interest of all parties concerned
in the sale, first giving at least ten days' notice of the time,
place and terms of sale, by published advertisement. The
deed provided that the proceeds of the sale, after paying its
expenses, and other expenses of the trust, and a commission to
the trustee, should be used to pay the debt, interest., costs and
expenses, whether due and unpaid, or unpaid though not due,
and the surplus to the grantors. There was also a provision
that the expense of insurance, as well as of any taxes the payment whereof might become necessary, should thereupon be-

Opinion of the Court.

come a debt due and owing by the grantors, the payment of
which should be secured by the deed.
There being default in the payment of interest, the trustee
published a notice that he would sell the property at public
auction, on December 8th, 1873, on the following terms:
$5,000, with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent. per
annum, from January 15th, 1873, "together with the expenses
o! sale, in cash, and the balance at one and two years, for
which the purchaser is to give his notes, bearing interest at
the rate of eight per cent. per annum, and secured by deed of
trust on the property sold." The property was sold for $16,509.66. The purchaser was Mrs. Burche. The charges against
the purchase money were stated by the trustee to be $7,692.45,
made up 6f $5,093.74 for note and interest, and $2,598.71 for
taxes, trustee's fee, auctioneer's commission *and advertising.
This left a net balance of $8,817.21, of which one-half, or
$4,408.60, was stated to belong to Mrs. Wallach, and to be the
sum to be secured for her benefit under the deed of trust to be
given on the property sold, according to published terms of
sale. Mr. Kennedy, as trustee, and Mrs. Mellen, on Decenrber
15th, 1873, made a deed to Mrs. Burche, conveying the property to her. This deed was acknowledged by the trustee on
December 24th, 1873. On that day Mrs. Burche executed to
Mrs. Mellen a deed of trust of the same property, to secure the
payment of a promissory note bearing that date, made by Mrs.
Burche, for $8,200, payable to the order of Mrs. Elizabeth
Hain, five years after date, with interest at the rate of 10 per
cent. per' annum, payable quarterly. This deed was acknowledged and recorded on that day, so as to make it a first lien
on the property. On the same day Mrs. Burche executed two
promissory notes, payable to the order of Mr. Kennedy, each
for $2,204.30, payable one in one year and the other in two
years after date, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent. per
annum, and, to secure them, executed to Anthony Hyde and
Albert F. Fox a deed of trust on the same property. This
deed was acknowledged December 31st, 1873, and recorded
January 7th, 1874. Of course it was only a second lien on the
property. Mrs. Mellen, Mrs. Burche and the trustee intended

Opinion of the Court.

that these notes to Mr. Kennedy and this second deed of trust
should be the provision for the $4,408.60 for Mrs. Wallach.
What was done caine about in this way: Mrs. Mellen made
an arrangement with Mrs. Burche to let the $5,000 of principal
stand, and to lend her $3,200 more, if she would secure the
$8,200 by a first lien on the property. Mrs. Hain was the mother
of Mrs. Mellen, and lent to her $1,000 of the $3,200. Mrs.
Mellen furnished the rest, and had the note made to Mrs. Hain,
and herself made trustee. Subsequently the notes were transferred to her. With some of the $3,200, the interest, taxes,
expenses, &c., beyond the $5,000, were paid, and the remainder
Mrs. Burche retained. Mrs. Wallach never accepted the two
notes given to Mr. Kennedy, or the deed of trust securing them,
and did not record that deed, or procure or authorize it to be
recorded.
In September, 1873, there being a dispute between Mrs.
Wallach and Mrs. Burche, as to the application of the rents of
the property, which, under an agreement between them, Mrs.
Wallach had been receiving for several years, and as to other
matters concerning the property, they agreed, in writing, to
submit the matter to three referees, who made an award Novemher 8th, 1873. On January 29th, 1874, Mrs. Burche brought a
suit in equity, in the Supreme Court-of the District of Columbia,
against Mrs: Wallach and Mr. Kennedy, praying for an accounting between herself and her sister respecting their interests in the poperty, and respecting the rents received and taxes
paid -nd repairs made by Mrs. Wallach, and respecting the
monpye' Vrs. Burche had -paid or secured on the property for
taxes and expenses of the trustee's sale and interest on the debt
to krs. Mellen, and respecting charges on the p~operty at the
time of ,the sale, and that the amount whilch should be found
to be due to Mrs. Burche be deduted from tbe"$4,408.60 going
to Mrs. Wallach, and that Mrs. -Vallach convey her interest in
the property to Mrs. Burche in fee sirr tIle, and that Mr, Kennedy and Mrs. Wallich be enjoined from parting with the two
notes or their proceeds till a final decree.
On December 1st, 1874, Mis. Wallach filed an answer to
Mrs. Burche's bill and also a cross-bill against Mr. Kenned ,

31ELLEN v. WALLACH.
, Opinion of the Court.

Mr. and Mrs. Burche, Mrs. Hain and Mrs. Mellen. In this
bill she attacked the validity of the sale under the deed of
trust, for various reasons, and prayed for an accounting between
herself and Mrs. B urche, and for the setting aside of the award,
and of the sale under the deed of trust, and for the cancelling
of the deed from Mr. Kennedy to Mrs. Burche, and for a sale
of the property. This cross-bill was not prosecuted, but on the
16th of January, 1875, Mrs. Wallach filed an original bill in
the same court against the same defendants as in the cross-bill,
and containing in substance the same allegations and praying
the same relief, and, in addition, the cancelling of the trust
deed from Mrs. Burche to Mrs. Mellen, and of that from
Mrs. Burche to Hyde and Fox. This bill contains the averment that Mrs. Wallach never admitted that the sale to Mrs.
Burche was a valid one, and that she had never received,
or sought to receive, any benefit therefrom, or to claim any.
thing thereunder, and that, shortly after the sale was made,
she gave notice to Mr. Kennedy that she denied that the sale
was valid.
Mr. and Mrs. Burche answered this bill. So did Mrs. Mellen.
The two suits were brought to a hearing together, on proofs,
before the court at special term, and on the 27th of June, 1877,
a decree was made, entitled in both suits, adjudging the sale of
December 8th, 1873, to have been a valid sale; and that Mrs.
Burche and Mrs. Wallach agreed with Mrs. Mellen that the
sale should be. made, and that, if either of them should purchase at the sale, Mrs. Mellen should lend to Ihe purchaser so
much money as should be found necessary to pay off the liens
on the property and the arrears of interest, with -costs and expenses of sale, and add the same to the original debt of $5,000,
and take a new deed of trust for the aggregate amount of those
two sums, which deed was to be the first mortgage on the property. The decree referred the suit brought by Mrs. Bu'che
to an auditor to state accounts between Mrs. Burche and Mrs.
Wallach. A decree was made dismissing the bill filed by Mrs.
Wa.lach. She appealed from both decrees to the court in general term, which, by a decree made June 5th, 1878, consolidated
the two suits, reversedthe decree in the suit brought by Mrs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

Wallach, modified the decree in the other suit,-and directed the
court in special term to enter a decree in the consolidated suits,
confirming the sale by Mr. Kennedy, and referring it to an
auditor to take 'various accounts between the parties. On the
5th of May, 1879, he reported eight accounts. Mrs. Mellen excepted to the report, and the auditor was directed to state a
further account. He did so on October 30th, 1879. On the
3d of January, 1880, the court in Vecial term made a decree in
the consolidated suit, adjudging that the sum of $5,000 due to
Mrs. Mellen, and the further sum of 82,429.02, afterwards advanced by her for the payment of interest in arrear, taxes and
other encumbrances, constituted the only lien upon the estates
of Mrs. Burche and Mrs. Wallach in the property on the day
of sale,, December 8th, 1873; that the further sum of $970.98
was due Mrs. Mellen from Mrs. Burche, and chargeable on her
share in the property; that the sum of $3,975.49 became due
on December 8th, 1873, to Mrs. Wallach, with interest, at the
rate of 8 per cent. per annum, for her share of the net proceeds
of the sale of the property on that day; and that the property
be sold by trustees. An ineffectual attempt by them to sell at
auction was made January 26th, 1880, $11,000 being bid, and
the property being then withdrawn. On June 9th, 1880, they
sold it, at auction, to Mrs. Mellen, for $9,900. On exceptions
by Mrs. Wallach, the court, on November 8th, 1880, set aside
thp sale, and ordered another. It was made, at auction, on
November 19th, 1880, tQ Mrs. Mellen, for $9,900. On December 29th, 1880, the court in special term made a decree confirming the sale, and allowing Mrs. Mellen to discount out of
the purchase money her claim of $7,429,02, fixeji by the decree
of Janua ry 3d, 1880, with interest on $7,105.41 thereof from
December 8th, 1873, and the taxes and assessments which had
accrued against the property since that date. A statem6nt
agreed to between Mrs. Mellen and Mrs. Wallach showed that
the net proceeds of sale were insufficient to pay the claims so
allowed to Mrs. Mellen, by the sum of $3,580.81. M rs. Wallach appealed to the court in general term, and on the 9th of'
July, 1881, it made a decree (1 Mackey, 236), which adjudged
that the arrangement made between Mrs. Burche and Mrs.

MELLEN v. WALLACH.
Opinion of the Court.

Mellen to encumber the property for $8,200 was without the
knowledge of Mrs. Wallach, and was never approved or ratified by her; that at the time of the execution of the trust deed
for $8,200, Mrs. Wallach was entitled to have out of the property $3,975.49, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum from December 8th, 1873; that the rights of Mrs. Wallach had not been waived by her, and could not be affected by
any arrangement between Mrs. Burche and Mrs. Mellen; that
the decree of the court in special term, made December 29th,
1880, be reversed; that Mrs. Mellen comply with the terms of
sale on her purchase within thirty days, or the property be resokl at her risk and cost; that the proceeds of the property be
applied in the first place to pay to Mrs. Wallch the 83,975.49,
with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum from
December 8th, 1873, and the residue be paid to Mrs. Mellen;
and that Mrs. Mellen pay the costs of the suits. From this
decree Mrs. Mellen has taken the present appeal.
The only question for consideration is, whether Mrs. Mellen
or Mrs. Wallach is entitled to priority of payment out of the
net proceeds of the sale of the property under the decree of
January 3d, 1880. If Mrs. Mellen is entitled to priority, there
is nothing for Mrs. Wallach; and she will have lost her interest
in the property and her share of the net proceeds of its sale by
Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy was authorized, by the deed of
trust, to sell upon such terms and conditions as he might deem
most for the interest of all parties concerned in the sale. He
exercised his best judgment in prescribing the terms he did,
which were $5,000, with interest at the rate 10 per cent.
per annum from January 15th, 1873, and the expenses of the
sale, in cash, and the balance at one and two years, with
interest at 8 per cent. per annum, secured by deed of trust on
the property sold. Although Mrs. Wallach attacked the
validity of the sale by her suit, and prayed for the cancelling
of the deed frqm Mr. Kennedy to Mrs. Burche, and of the trust
deed from Mrs. Burehe to Mrs. Mellen, the court, in special
term, by its decree of June 27th, 1877, adjudged the sale to be
valid, and, although Mrs. Wallach appealed, the court in
general term confirmed the sale. If that sale had been cariied

Opinion of the Court.

out according to its terms, Mrs. Mellen would have received in
cash her $5,000 of principal, and what was due to her beyond
that would have been secured in notes at one and two years,
with a deed of trust, and the surplus going to Mrs. Wallach
would have been secured by the same deed of trust. But in
such event, Mrs. Mellen would have been entitled to receive
first the whole amount going to her before M rs. Wallach could
receive anything, because Mrs. Wallach's claim was only to the
surplus. But the sale by Mr. Kennedy was not carried out according to its terms. The court in general term, by its decree
of June 5th, 1878, confirmed the sale, and provided for taking
accounts, although it reversed the decree which had dismissed
Mrs. Wallach's bill, and evidently contemplated then that the
.sale might be carried out, for the decree says, that inasmuch
a$ the settlement for such sale, made by Mrs. Mellen and Mrs.
Burche, was complained of, and it was alleged that the account
on which the sale was settled was made up without the knowl.
edge of Mrs. Wallach, and Mrs. Wallach alleged that a much
larger amount had been charged to her than ought to have
been, therefore, in order to settle the equities of the parties
interested in the sale, between Mrs. Mellen and Mrs. Wallach
and Mrs. lBurche, and between Mrs. Mellen and Mrs. Burche,
and between Mrs. Wallach and Mrs. Burche, growing out of
the sale and otherwise, the reference is made. The reference
embraced an ascertainment of the liens on the property at the
date of its sale, and what share of them was chargeable to
Mrs. Wallach, and what sum, if any, due from her to Mrs.
Burche ought to be set off against Mrs. Wallach's interest in
the proceeds of Mr. Kennedy's sale, and what were the expenses of such sale. The same decree reserved all the equities
between the parties touching the matters in controversy until
the report should be made and confirmed.
The $8,200 deed of trust was given by Mrs. lBurche to Mrs.
Mellen, and the parties got into litigation. As a result of that,
the court in special term decreed, on January 3d, ISSO, that
the sum of $5,000 due to Mrs. Mellen, and the $2,429.02 which
she had advanced to pay interest in arrear, taxes and other
encumbrances, were liens on the property on the day of Mr.

MELLEN v. WALLACH.
Opinirn of the Court.

Kennedy's sale. But the decree went on to direct a sale of
the property and of all the interest and estate therein of all
the parties to the suit, by trustees whom it appointed. The
decree directed the trustees to bring into court t ie money and
notes which they should receive, to be distribui ed under the
further order of the court. This decree was not appealed from,
but the sale took place under it. That sale was confirmed by
the court in special term, by its dedree of December 29th, 1880.
Mis. Mellen acquiesced in that decree by not appealing from
it. On Mrs. WWallach's appeal from it, the court in general
term decreed that the trustees who made the sale should require Mrs. Mellen to comply specifically with the terms of her
purchase. Mrs. Wallach did not appeal from that, and so she
acquiesced in it; and Mrs. Mellen, on her appea. to this court
assigns for error only the action of the general term in giving
to Mrs. Wallach priority of payment. Mrs. Burche, being a
party to both suits, and not appealing, is bound by the decrees.
In view of all this, it must be held that all parties have by
their action abandoned the sale by Mr. Kennedy, and acquiesced in the subsequent sale to Mrs. Mellen. It follows
from this that all claim of Mrs. Wallach to any surplus from
the sale by Mr. Kennedy is gone. Mrs. Mellen, instead of exacting on the sale in cash her $5,000, was willing to leave it to
be still a first lien on the property. Her priority of lien, as
established by the decree of January 3d, 180 , which was not
appealed from, extended to the sum of $2,429.02, beyond the
$5,000, as money which she had paid to discharge interest,
costs, expenses aid taxes which were made a lien on the property by the trust deed to Mi. Kennedy. That amount was,
with the $5,000 embraced in the $8,200, covered by the deed
of trust made by Mrs. Burche. But, to the extent of
$7,429.02, with the interest awarded by the-decree of December 29th, 1880, Mrs. Mellen's claim stands and has never been
satisfied. It is a first lien under the trust-deed to Mr. Kennedy, which remains to be enforced for the benefit of Mrs.
Mellen, the sale under that deed being, as shown, out of theway, by assent of all parties. Mrs. Mellen has never waived
that claim and lien. She asserted them by taking the trust

dded from Mrs. Burche, to which we see no valid objection, so
far, at least, as the amount for which she had a lien at the date
of Mr. Kennedy's sale is concerned, and which is the amount
allowed her by the court in special term as a lien. She has
asserted the same claim and lien constantly ever since. She
did not abandon them by assenting to the re-sale provided for
by the decree of January 3d, 1880. In fact that decree, so far
as the $7,429.02 adjudged by it to be due' to Mrs. Mellen and
to have been a lien on the property on the day of Mr. Kennedy's sale, and so far as Mrs. Mellen's claim to that extent is
concerned, may properly be regarded as ordering a re-sale to
enforce Mrs. Mellen's rights under the deed of trust to Mr.
Kennedy. Such is its effect. Astor v. .iller, 2 Paige, 68;
