UNITED STATES CARTRIDGE COMPANY v. UNION
METALLIC CARTRIDGE COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.
Argued December 5,8, 9,1834.-Decided December 22, 184.

Letters patent No. 27,094 were issued to Ethan Allen, February 14, 1860, for
14 years, for an "improvement in machine for making percussion cartridge
cases." The patent was reissued in two divisions, No. 1,948 and No. 1,949,
Mlay 9, 1865. No. 1,948 embraced that part of the invention which con.
cerned the mechanism for striking up the hollow rim at one stroke. The
original patent and drawings showed such mechanism to be a moving die
and a fixed bunter. In No. 1,948, the description was altered so as to state
that the bunter might be carried against the die ; and its two claims each
contained the words "substantially as described." An extension of No.
1,948 having been applied for, it was opposed, on the ground that such arrangement of a fixed die and a moving bunter was a new invention, interpolated into the reissue. The Commissioner of Patents so held, and required such new matter to be disclaimed, as a condition precedent to the
extension. A disclaimer was filed disclaiming the movable bunter as of the
invention of Allen. No. 1,948 was then extended by a certificate which
stated that a disclaimer had been filed to that part. of the invention embraced in such new matter. In a suit in equity afterwards brought on NQ.
1,948, against machines having a fixed die and a moving bunter, for in-

fringements committed both before and after the extension : Held, That
the effect of the disclaimer was to exclude those maphines from the scope
of any claim in No. 1,948, without reference to the question whether they
contained mechanical equivalents for the moving die and the fixed bunter.
Allen had not, before the granting of the original patent, made any machine
in which the die was fixed and the bunter -novable; and it was never lawful
to cover, by the claims of a reissue, an improvement made after the granting of the original patent.
Under § 54 of the act of July 8, 1870, ch. 280, 16 Stat. 205, a disclaimer could
be made only by a patentee who had claimed more than that of which he
was the original or first inventor or discoverer, and he could make a dis-

claimer only of such parts of the thing patented as he should not choose to
claim or hold by virtue of the patent.
In so disclaiming or limiting a claim, descriptive matter on which the disclaimed claim was based might be erased; but, if there was merely a de-

Statement of Facts.
fective or insufficient description, the only mode of correcting it was by a
reissue.
The decision in Leggett v. Avery, 101 U. S. 256, cited and applied.
An acquiescence and disclaimer, on a decision requiring the disclaimer as a
condition precedent to an extension, are as operative to prevent the afterwards insisting on a recovery on the invention disclaimed, as to prevent a
subsequent reissue to claim what was so disclaimed.

Letters patent of the United States, No. 27,094, were issued
to Ethan Allen, February 14, 1860, for 14 years, for an "improvement in machine for making percussion cartridge cases."
A reissue of this patent was granted, in two divisions, No.
1,948 and No. 1,949, May 9, 1865, the application for the reissue having been filed April 7, 1865. The specification of No.
27,094 set forth two improvements: (1) an arrangement or
mechanism to trim the open end of the case of the cap-cartridge, to make the articles all alike and true; (2) striking up
or forming the swelled end to form the recess for the priming,
as shown at Z, from that of Y, at one stroke, in distinction
from spinning them. There were two claims in No. 27,094:
(1) the trimming mechanism; (2) striking or forming the hollow rim at one stroke or operation. In reissuing the patent,
the trimming mechanism was made the subject of No. 1,949,
and the other improvement (the subject-matter of claim 2 of
No. 27,094), was made the subject of No. 1,948. This suitwas
brought for the infringement of No. 1,948 alone. So much of
th. specification and claims of No. 27,094 as related to the subject of No. 1,948, is copied below on the left hand, and the
- specification and claims of No. 1,948 are copied below on the
right hand, the parts of each not found in the other being in

The Allen machine, as organized for heading, and making a
flange upon, cartridge shells, consisted, mainly, of a mandrel, a
die, and a bunter, which were combined together in order to
operate. The mandrel was a rod with a shoulder upon it, the
rod beyond the shoulder being of such diameter as to enter the
cartridge shell, which was to. be headed, with a pretty close fit,
and the shoulder being at right angles to the rod, and formed
to support the edge of the shell at the open end of the cartridge, during the operation of heading. The die was a block
of metal with a hole in it, of just the size of the outside of the
shell; and the axes of the die and mandrel were in the same
line. The bunter was a piece of metal so located that it was
opposite one end of the die. The machine was also provided
with a gutter, which was a prolongation of the hole in the
die, but open on top, into which shells were to be introduced
prior to being acted upon by the machine. When an unheaded
shell was placed in this gutter, with the mandrel as far retracted from the die as possible, the mandrel advanced, in-

serted itself into the shell, and shoved the shell into the die
with its closed end projecting beyond the die a sufficient distance to afford metal from which the flange might be formed.
In this position, the outside of the shell was supported by the
die, the inside of the shell by the mandrel, and the edges at
the open end of the shell by the shoulder on the mandrel
The die, mandrel, and shell then advanced together, and the
closed end of the shell was forced against the bunter, the shell
being thus squeezed down so as to. form the flange of the cartridge. The mandrel then retreated, and, as it retreated, slipped
out of the shell, leaving the headed shell in the die, and, when
the mandrel was fully out of the shrell, the die was in its old
p6sition. The shell could not follow the mandrel, owing to
the fact that it was now headed, and that its head was on that
side of the die which was farthest from the mandrel After
the mandrel had retreated sufficiently far.from that end of the
die which was nearest the mandrel, a second unflanged shell
might be placed in the gutter. The mandrel then advanced
and entered the shell as before, and the advance of this shell
on the end of the mandrel drove out the shell which had just
been headed and was sticking in the die. After this second
shell had been driven far enough into the die, it was headed as
the first shell was, andwas, in turn, pushed out by a third shell;
and so on in succession. In the operation of the machine, the
shell was forced into one end of the die and expelled at the
other end, so that the shell moved in the same line and in the
same direction from the time it was first acted upon by the
mandrel until it was completely expelled from the die. The
end of the die farthest from the mandrel was the anvil or rest
against which the shell was headed, by the conjoint action of
the die and the bunter, the flange being formed fully at the
time when the die and bunter were as near as possible the one
to the other.
The description in the original patent of the mechanism for
striking up or forming at one stroke the swelled end to form
the recess for the priming, described the die D as movable,
and as being carried with the case or shell, and the mandrel B,
in it, against the stationary die E. This is the description to

-CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
.Statement of Facts.

which the second claim of the original patent referred when it
claimed "1trikingor forming the hollow rim at one stroke or
operation, as above set forth and described." The drawings
represented that arrangement and no other.
In the reissue, it was stated that the case or shell might be
carried against the die E to form the rim, or the die E might be
carried against the die D by similar mechanism to the slide F
and the rod H'. It was also stated that the cases or shells
were placed in the recess or gutter, or in an inclined tube,
which fed them to the punch or mandrel B. Nothing was said
in the specification of the original patent about carrying the
die E against the die D, or about feeding the cases or shells by
an inclined tube.
Allen having died, Sarah E. Allen was duly appointed his
executrix, in February, 1871. In November, 1873, she applied
to the Commissioner of Patents for an extension of No. 1,948
and of No. 1,949. The application was opposed by E. Remington & Sons. Much testimony was taken on both sides. The
day of hearing was February 4, 1874. The Commissioner
of Patents decided to grant the extension, and rendered the
tollowing decision, 5 Off. Gaz. 14:
"This is an application by the executrix of the -estate of
Ethan Allen, for the extension of reissued patents Nos. 1,948
and 1,949, granted May 9, 1865. The original patent was
granted to Ethan Allen, February 14,1860, and comprehended
-a combined apparatus for trimming the open ends, and thei
heading the closed ends, of blanks for forming metallic cartridge shells. These operations are each performed automatically, but independently, by different portions of the machinery.
Reissue No. 1,948 comprehends the mechanism for heading the
shell, and No. 1,949 that for trimming it. No testimony is
presented relating to the latter, and it may be dismissed from
consideration. Some interpolations of new matter appear in
the former, but they have been disclaimed, rendering the scope
of the patent unequivocally that of the invention originally
described and illustrated in drawing and model. The device
in question consists of a hollow recessed sliding die, a reciprocating mandrel, having a shoulder permitting it to enter a shell

the proper distance for heading, and a stationary bunter, organized into a machine which operates as follows: The mandrel being withdrawn into the back portion of the die, which
serves merely as a guide for it, a shell with its open end to the
rear is placed in the recess of the die, in the path of the mandrel. As the mandrel advances, it enters the shell, and carries it into the die until its closed end projects a little in front
for heading. At this point the stock of the mandrel strikes
the rear of the die and carries it forward until the projecting
end of the shell strikes a fixed anvil and is headed. The mandrel and die then retreat, carrying the headed shell, the die being forced back by a spring to its original position, and the
mandrel continuing until it has withdrawn from the shell and
passed the feeding recess. The headed shell remains in the
die until it is forced out by the -advance of the next shell.
This is the machine patented, and the claims of the patent are
as follows: '1. The mandrel which carries the cartridge shell,
in combination with the die D, which admits the same, and
against which the closed end of the cartridge shell is headed,
substantially as described. 2. The die I), constructed and
operating for the heading of cartridge shells, substantially as
described. This was the first successful organized automatic
machine for heading cartridge shells. It has undergone various improvements, however, and, as built, and (according to
the testimony of the witness Cook) used by the inventor, it is
not now in use. It, however, furnished the essential principle
of construction which has been maintained in all succeeding
heading machines of its class. The hollow die and reciprocating mandrel to receive and carry forward the shell to be headed,
and at the same time force out the preceding headed shell, are
the chief elements of the machines which have produced the
*ast quantity of shells that have come into the market since
the date of this invention. The rear or guide portion of the
die is omitted in the present machines; and, instead of a recess in the die, a special feeding device is employed; also, instead of advancing the die against the anvil, it is now made
stationary and the anvil is advanced, the die spring being transferred to it. Whether this latter modification, which is the

CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
Statement of Facts.

principal one, and is admitted to effect materially superior results in heading'tlie larger sizes of shells, is in legal contemplation an equivalent construction mechanically improved, or
a substantive invention, has been the subject of much contention in this application. I am, however, so entiely convinced
that the matter introduced into the reissue, describing the holding die as stationary, and the bunter as movable, was new matter describing a substantially different invention from the original, possessing different functions, that I have required, as a
condition precedent to extension, that this new matter, together with that of the inclined tube for feeding, should be
absolutely disclaimed. With such disclaimer, the patent is extended."
With a view to the extension, the following disclaimer was
filed on the 4th of February, 1874:
"To the Commissioner of Patents:

Sarah E. Allen, executrix, having, on the 21st of February,
1874, assigned her title to the extended term of No. 1,948, to
the Union Metallic Cartridge Company, it brought this suit in
equity against the United States Cartridge Company, on the
18th of March, 1874, for the infringe.ment of No. 1,948. The
bill alleged an assignment by the executrix to the plaintiff, of
her title to No. 1,948, on the 10th of February, 1871 ; an assignment by the plaintiff to her, on the 7th of February, 1874,
of all of its title to No. 1,948; the extension; and the assignment of the extended term. The assignments above mentioned
were duly proved. The bill made no reference to any disclaimer.
The machine of the defendant had the die D stationary and
the die E, or bunter, movable, and it had an inclined tube for
feeding. The die D, the mandrel B, and the bunter E were,
as tools, the same as those in the plaintiff's machine. The
mandrel entered the shell, pushed it into the die D, supported it
on the inside while it was being headed, and the unheaded
shell expelled the headed shell from the die D, as in the plaintiff's machine. The die D supported the outside of the shell
while it was being headed, and the end of that die acted as an
anvil against -which the flange was formed by the joint operation of such anvil and the bunter, as in the plaintiff's machine.
The flange was fully formed at the time when the end of the
die D and the bunter were as close together as the operation
of the machine would permit them to be, which was true, also,
of the plaintiff's machine. In the defendant's machine, as in
the plaintiff's, the unheaded shell entered at one end of the die
D, and was expelled from the other end, and moved always in

CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
Statement of Facts.

the same direction -with relation to the die D, from the time
that the mandrel first took charge of it, until, after being
headed, it was expelled from the die. But, in the defendant's
machine the die D stood still and the bunter moved towards it
to head the shell, while the drawings of No. 27,094 and of
N o. 1,948 showed a stationary bunter, and the die D moving
towards it, to head the shell
The answer denied that the reissue was lawful, and averred
that the original patent was surrendered to claim inventions
not made by Allen; that the reissue No. 1,948 was not for the
same invention as was the original patent; that, as the reissue
was void, the extension, also, was void; that the commissioner
granted the extension only on the express condition precedent,
that certain new matter unlawfully introduced into the reissue
(as decided by him), should be absolutely disclaimed, and that
only upon such disclaimer should the patent be extended; and
that said condition had not been complied with. It denied infringement.
Proofs having been taken, the case was heard before Judge
Shepley, and he decided it in favor of the plaintiff, on the 13th
of April, 1877, and entered a decree holding No. 1,948 to be
valid, and to have been infringed, and awarded an account of
profits and damages, before a master, from February 10, 1871;
except as to the period from February 7, 1874, to February
21, 1874, and a perpetual injunction restraining the defendant
from making, using or vending "machines for heading cartridge shells, having a die, mandrel and bunter," excepting five
machines specially named, the question as to the use of which
was reserved till the master should make his report. The decision of Judge Shepley, 2 Bann. & A., 593, and 11 Off. Gas.
1113, said: "1In the machine admitted to be used by the defendant are found substantially the same die, mandrel and bunter,
operating in the same manner to form the flanged head of the
cartridge and to expel the shell after being headed, except that
in defendant's machine the bunter. moves toward the die to
head the shell, while in the Allen machine the die moves
toward the bunter to head the shell. The fact, as proved,
that, especially in the case of cartridges of larger sizes, therp

OCTOBER TERM, 1884..
Statement of Fact&

is an advantage in having the die stationary, while the bunter
moves toward it, is not suffcient alone to shoW that this latter
form of the machine is not an equivalent of the other, all the
elements of the combination existing alike in both, and acting
alike in combination. It is contended on the part of the defendait, that the action of the Commissioner of Patents, in
requiring a disclaimer of so much of the reissued patent as
claimed in specific terms the use of the movable bunter and
the stationary die, as an equivalent for the movable die and
the fixed bunter, before granting an extension, is conclusive
upon the complainant, but we do not so regard it. The
patentee, without describing equivalents, is entitled. to use
equivalents, and to treat the use of equivalents by others as
an infringement, and this, upon the evidence in the record,
appears to be a clear case of such a use."
The master made a report as to profits, to which exceptions
were filed by both parties. On the hearing of the exceptions
the case was reheard before Judge Lowell on the question as
to whether the original decree should be reversed. He rendered a decision, 7 Fed. Rep. 344, in which he said: " Allen's
original patent described a machine organized to move a 'die'
against a 'bunter,' and, by their contact, to form a flange or
head upon the metallic cartridge, which was carried by the
die. The defendant's machine brought a movable bunter
against a fixed die. This was. an improved form of the machine, and was, perhaps, a p'atentable improvement; but it
was the same machine, and was an undoubted infringement.
This improvement was invented by Allen himself, but, after
he had obtained his patent, and when he .eked for a reissue, he
,inserted in his description of the mechanism this modified and
improved form. The Commissioner required him to disclaim
this part of his description, as a condition precedent to granting the reissue. Judge Shepley held that the disclaimer did
not prevent the patentee from enjoining the use of machines
having this improvement. It is now argued, and, certainly,
with much force, that Leggett v. Avey, 101 U. S. 256, holds
the patentee to this disclaimer, as an estoppel. I appreciate
the argument, but do not consider myself bound to reverse

CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
Opinion of the Court.

Judge Shepley's decision, which I should not feel at liberty to
do unless my mind were entirely satisfied that he was wrong.
No one can doubt that, if a patentee obtains a patent upon his
solemn admission of certain facts, he shall never thereafter be
permitted to controvert them. This is .Leggett v. Avery. Judge
Shepley, though giving his opinion before that case was decided, could not have overlooked thispoint. I understand
him to decide, that the admission in this case was not of a fact
of invention, but of the propriety of inserting a certain clause

in the descriptive part of the specification, and, if this were
not so, still, if the patentee's invention and his patent rightly
included this form, as an equivalent, it was a mere nullity, like
an admission of law, to confess that it did not include it. This
is the idea shortly expressed by Judge Shepley; and I do not
see any necessary conflict between it and the decision of the
Supreme Court."
The exceptions of both parties were overruled, and a decree
was entered for the plaintit for $40,361.26, profits to April 23;
1877, without damages. From this- decr.e both parties appealed to this court2 but the plaintiff waived its appeal, at the
bar.

He recited the facts as above stated, and continued:
M3any questions were discussed at the hearing which we
deem it unnecessary to consider, because we are of opinion
that the, disclaimer made has the effect to so limit the construction of the claims of the reissue that the defendant's machine
cannot be held to infringe those claims. The opposition:to the
extension proceeded, among other things, on the ground that
reissue No. 1,948 was. so worded as to cover a machine having
a stationary die and a movable bunter-one not within, the
language or the scope of the original patent, not indicated

Opinion of the Court.

therein as the invention of Allen, and not described, and a substantially new and different invention. That the Commissioner. intended that the extension should not be granted unless there should be a disclaimer of all claim to have No. 1,948
cover a machine with a stationary die and a movable bunter,
and that the second disclaimer filed was such a disclaimer, and
that the patent extended cannot be held to be one which
covers, by any claim, the defendant's machine, is, we think,
entirely clear.
The Commissioner, in his decision, says, that the "interpolations of new matter" in No. 1,948 "have been disclaimed,"
and that such disclaimer renders "the scope of the patent unequivocally that of the invention originally described and illustrated in drawing and model." The disclaimer is referred to
as limiting the scope of the patent, that is, the extent of its
claims, and as reducing such scope and extent to what the
drawings and moalel illustrated, namely, a movable die and a
stationary bunter, to the exclusion of a stationary die and a
movable buner. The Commissioner adds, that it had been the
subject of much c6ntention, in the application for the extension, whether the modification, of having a stationary die and
a movable anvil, which, he says, it was admitted, effected
materially superior results in heading the larger sizes of shells,
was, in legal contemplation, an equivalent construction mechanically improved, or a substantive invention; and that he is
so entirely convinced that the matter introduced into the reissue, describing the holding die as stationary, and the bunter as
movable, was new matter describing a substantially different
invention from the original, possessing different functions, that
he 'had required, as a condition precedent-to extension, that
this new matter should be absolutely disclaimed. The new
matter introduced into the reissue in respect to the moving of
the bunter or die E, was introduced into the descriptive part,
by inserting the words, "or that" (the die E) "may be carried
-against the die D by similar mechanism to F and I'," but it
was also introduced into the two claims, by the use of the
words "substantially as described," in those claims.
This reissue took place under § 13 of the act- of July 4,

CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
Opinion of the Court.

1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 122, which provided for a surrender
and the issuing of a new patent "for the same invention," "in
accordance with the patentee's corrected description and specification." This provision was repeated in § 53 of the act of
July 8, 1870, ch. 230, 16 Stat. 205, now § 4916 of the Revised
Statutes, with the additional 'enactment that "no new matter
shall be introduced into the specification." But where new
matter was, even before the act of 1870, introduced into the
description, and in such manner as to enlarge the claim, and
cause the patent to be not "for the same invention," the
reissue was invalid to the extent that it was not for the same
invention.
It is quite clear that Allen bad not, before the granting of
the original patent, made any machine in which the die D was
stationary and the bunter movable. If that arrangement was
a "new improvement of the original invention," and was invented by Allen, and after the date of the original patent, he
could, under § 13 of the act of 1836, have had a "description
and specification" of it ".annexed to the original description.
and specification," on like proceedings as in the case of an
original application, and it would have had "the same effect,
in law," from "the time of its being annexed and recorded,"
"as though it had been embraced in the original description
and specification;" or he could have applied for a new patent
for the improvement. Such last named provision of § 13 of the
act of 1836 was repealed by the act of 1870, and was not reenacted therein, nor is it found in the Revised Statutes. But
it was never lawful to cover, by the claims of a reissue, an improvement ihade after the granting of the original patent.
The statute in force in regard to disclaimers, when the disclaimers were filed in this case, was § 54 of the act of 1870,
which provided, "that whenever, through inadvertence, accident or mistake, and without any fradulent or deceptive intention, a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was
the original or first inventor or discoverer, his patent.shall
be valid for all that part which is truly and justly his own,
provided the same is a material or substantial part of the thing
patented; and any such patentee, his heirs or assigns, whether

of the whole or any sectional interest therei,'may, on payment of the duty'required by la-w, make disclaimer of such
parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or
hold by virtue ef- the patent or assignment, stating therein the
extent of his interest in such patent; said disclaimer shall be in
writing, attested by one or more witnesses, and recorded in the
Patent Office, and it shall thereafter be considered as part of
the original specification, to the extent of the interest possessed
by the claimant and by those claiming under him after the
record thereof." This word "claimant" is an evident error,
for "disclaimant," as " disclaimant" is the word used in § I of
the act of March 3, 183T, ch. 45, 5 Stat. 193, which was the
first stAtute providing for a disclainer. This error is perpetuated in § 491'[ of the Revised Statutes.
It is a patentee who "has claimed more than that of which
he was the original or first inventor or discoverer," and only
"such patentee," or his assigns, who can make a disclaimer;
and the disclaimer can be a disclaimer only "of such parts of
the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or hold by virtue of the patent or assignment." A disclaimer can be made
only when something has been claimed of which the pat6ntee
was not the original or first inventor, and when it is intended
to limit a claim in respect to the thing so not originally or first
invented. It is true, that, in so disclaiming or limiting a claim,
descriptive matter on which the disclaimed claim is based, may,
as incidental, be erased, in aid of, or as ancillary-to. the disclaimer. But the statute expressly limits a disclaimer to a rejection of something before claimed as new or as invented,
when it was not new or invented, and which th6 patentee or
his assignee no longer chooses to claim or hold. It is true,
that this same end may be reached by a reissue, when the
patentee has claimed as his own invention more than he had a
right to claim as new, but, if a claim is not to be rejected or
limited, but there is merely "a defective or insufficient specification," that is, description, as distinguished from a claim, the
only mode of correcting it was and is by a reissue.
It is apparent that the Commissioner, when he said that the
disclaimer affected "the scope of the patent," and that the

CARTRIDGE CO. v. CARTRIDGE CO.
Opinion of the Court.

matter introduced into the reissue was "new matter, describing a substantially different invention from the original, possessing different functions," and that he had required it to be
absolutely disclaimed, "as a condition precedent to extension,"
meant that he had required such new matter, that is, the arrangement of a stationary die and a movable bunter, to be
disclaimed, as an invention of Allen, covered by the reissue.
What was done was in accordance with this view. In the
first disclaimer, that of February 4th, 1874, it is said, that by
inadvertence, accident, or mistake, the words "or that may be
carried against the die D by similar mechanism to F and H'-"
were inserted in the descriptive part of No. 1,948, and were
not in the descriptive part of the original patent. Thereupon,
the petitioners disclaim, not such descriptive words, as a description merely, but they disclaim "the movable die E as being of the invention of"1 Allen, but with this limitation or reservation, "except in so far as the same, by fair construction,
may be deemed the mechanical equivalent of the die E described and shown" in the original patent and its drawings.
It was sought to reserve the question of the mechanical equivalency of the stationary die and movable bunter with the movable die and stationary bunter, and not have the disclaimer absolutely reach and cover the former, but still leave the claims
to cover it. But this was evidently not satisfactory to the
Commissioner, and he required a further disclaimer. So, the
one of February t3, 1874, was filed, which states, on its face,
that it "is absolute, and is filed as an additional disclaimer" to
the first one, "in which certain reservations were made." In
this second disclaimer, the language as to the inserted words is
the same as in the first, and the statement of disclaimer is,
that the "petitioners disclaim the said movable die E (called a
bpnter) as being of the invention" of Allen, " thus leaving the
description of said die E the same as shown in the" original
patent and drawings. The reservation was expunged.. The
effect of the, disclaimer was to limit the claims of the reissue
toa machine with the stationary die E, shown in the original
patent and. drawings, and to prevent their any longer covering,
even if they had before covered, a movable die E, or bunter..

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of tho Court.

Such was the effect of the disclaimer on the reissue, without
reference to the extension. But, the certificate of extension
itself states, that the executrix had "filed a disclaimer to that
part of the invention embraced in the following words: 'or
that may be carried against the die D by similar mechanism to
F and I','" and what is extended is 1o.1,948, with such disclaimer. After an extension has been obtained on the condition precedent of making such disclaimer, the disclaimer cannot be held inoperative as respects the extended term.
We regard this case as falling within the principles laid down
in Leggett v. Avery, 101 U. S. 256. There the original patent
was issued in October, 1860. It was surrendered and reissued
in June, 1869, and extended in October, 1874. As a condition
of obtaining the extension, the patentee disclaimed the specific
claims which the defendants in the suit were charged with infringing, the extension having been opposed, and the Commissioner having refused to grant it unless the patentee would
abandon all but one of the six claims of the reissue, there having been but one claim in the original patent. This was done,
and the extension was granted for only one of the six claims,
which one the defendants had not infringed. Three days after
the extension was granted a reissue was applied for, including
substantially the claims which had been thus disclaimed. The
reissue was granted, two of the claims in it being for substantially the same inventions which had been so disclaimed before
the extension, and for different inventions from the invention
secured by the patent as extended. A reference to the record
of the case in this court shows, that the Commissioner decided
that the extension would be granted provided-the disclaimer
should be filed, and that the disclaimer concluded with the
words "reserving right to reissue in proper form." -This court
held, that the Commissioner erred in allowing, in the- second reissue, claims which had been expressly disclaimed, because the
validity of such claims had been considered and decided with
the acquiescence and express disclaimer of the patentee; and
that this was a fatal objection to the validity of the second reissue.
The acquiescence and disclaimer must be regaxded as equally

Syllabus.

operative to prevent those who hold the reissue in suit, whether
in respect to the time before or after the extension, from being
heard to allege that persons who use machines with a stationary
die D and a movable bunter* E infringe the claims of the reissue. The disclaimer was one of the fact of invention. It
could not lawfully be anything but a disclaimer of the fact,
either of original invention, or of first invention. It was not
merely the expunging of a descriptive part of the specification,
involving only the propriety of inserting such descriptive part
in the specification, but it was a disclaimer of all claim based
on such descriptive part, because the claims were made to cover
such descriptive part, by the words "substantially as described,"
in the two claims. The question of fact is not open now as to
whether Allen invented at any time the stationary die D and
movable bunter E, or as to whether it was, or is, or could be,
a mechanical equivalent for the movable die D and stationary
bunter E, because those questions are concluded by the dis,Plaimer.
It is conceded by the plaintiff, that, if by the operation of
the disclaimer, it is estopped to say that a stationary die D and
a movable bunter E are the equivalent of the movable die D
and the stationary bunter E, the defendant does not infringe.
