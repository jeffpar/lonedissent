TORRENT ARMS LUMBER COMPAN-Y v. RODGERS.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
Argued November 25, 1834.-Decided December 2, 1884.

A reissue of a patent, applied for with unreasonable delay, and for the purpose of enlarging the specification and claims, in order to include within the
monopoly an invention patented after the original patent was granted, is
void as to the new claims.

This was an action at law brought June 25, 1879, by Alexander Rodgers, the defendant in error, against The Torrent and
Arms Lumber Company, the plaintiff in error, to recover damages for the infringement of reissued letters patent for "a new
and improved machine for rolling saw-logs," dated July 15,
1873, granted to Rodgers as the assignee of Esau Tarrant, the
original patentee. The lumber company pleaded the general
issue, with notice that, among other things, it would give in
evidence, and insist in its defence, "that the said patentee and
his assignee, the plaintiff, unjustly obtained the reissued patent
for matters and principles embraced in such reissue not included
in the original patent or specification therefor, and for what was
in fact invented by another, to wit, John Torrent, of the city
of Muskegon, who was using reasonable diligence in adapting
and perfecting the same;" that John Torrent "made his application for a patent therefor on January 29, 1873, and his
patent was granted August 12, 1873, and the plaintiff and his
assignee had knowledge prior to the application for such reissue of the aforesaid application for patent by the said John

Torrent, andStle said principles so patented by the said John
Torrent had (by him) been used at the city of Muskegon, aforesaid, by said John Torrent and others."
Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, Rodgers, to maintain the
issue on his part, introduced in evidence the original letters
patent, dated August 25, 1868, granted to Esau Tarrant for "a

IM

new and improved machine for rolling saw-log-s, the assign
ment of said letters patent by the patentee to Rodgers, and the
reissued letters patent granted to Rodgers as the assignee of
Torrent, applied for June 25, 1873, and issued and dated July 15,
1873.
The specification and claims of the original and reissued
patents were both illustrated by the annexed drawings.

"Be it known that I, Esau Tarrant, of M fuskegon, in the
county of Mfuskegon and State of AMichigan, have invented a

new and improved machine for turning [rolling saw] logs; and
I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear and exact
description thereof, which will enable others skilled in the art to

"MIy invention has for its o ct to furnish an improved device for turning or rolling logs to or upon the carriage of circular or other saw-mills, which shall be simple in construction,
effective in operation, and conveniently operated; and it consists in the application for that p pose of a toothed-bar connboted with means for giving it the necessary movement; and
further, in the construction and combination of the various
parts, as hereinafter more, fully described.
"A represents [a part of] the frame work, and 3 [represents] the log carriage of a [an ordinary] saw-mill [about the
construction of which parts there is nothing new].

"The lower end of the toothed arm C is pivoted to and between two blocks E, which moves up and down in grooves
in the inner sides of the posts D, as shown in Figure 2, and in
dotted lines in Figure 1.
"This construction enables the upper end of the [upright]
bar C to move back and forth to adjust itself to the size of the
log to be rolled or turned upon the carriage B, and also to
eilable the teeth c' to pass the log when the bar is descending.
"To the rear side of thee lower end of the bar C is attached,
or upon it is formed, a block, arm, or projection el, to which is
attached the end of the rope or chain F, by means of which the
said [upright] bar C is raised to turn the log.
"This manner of attaching the hoisting chain forces the
upper end of the said bar 0 forward, causing the teeth el to
take afirm [firmer] hold upon the log to be rolled.

end works in bearings secured upon [attached to] the bridgetree 0, ofie end of which is pivoted to the frame A, and the
other [end of which] rests upon the cam P, of the cam-sihaft Q,
so that by means of said cam-shaft the bridge-tree 0 may be
raised or lowered to bring the friction-pulley L into or remove
it from contact with the friction-pulley K.

It appeared by the bill of exceptions that the only claim of
the reissued patent upon which the plaintiff relied, or which was
considered under the instructions of the court to the jury, was
the first claim. The plaintiff relied simply upon the infringement of the toothed-bar and its mode of operation. He did not
allege infringement of any combination claim, or of the device,
or any of its parts, by which the movement of the toothed-bar
was produced.
The plaintiff also introduced evidence tending to show, as he
claimed, infringement by the defendant of the first claim of
the reissued patent, and evidence tending to show the damages
sustained by him by reason of such infringement.
The defendant, to sustain his defences, introduced in evidence
letters patent "for certain improvements in log-turners" issued
to John Torrent, dated August 12, 1873, upon his application
therefor filed January 29, 1873. In this patent a wedge-shaped
toothed-bar is shown hinged at its lower end to an upright shaft,
in order that it might adjust itself in proper position to take hold
of a log and rbll it to and on the carriage of a saw-mill. The
apparatus was shown in combination with inclined ways upon
the log-deck, provided with a stop to hold back the logs which
lay side by side in a series on the log-deck, and it was intended

Statement of Facts.

that the log-turning device should separate the last log in the
series from the others, and roll it over from the deck upon the
carriage. The first claim of the patent was "the toothed-bar,
the bottom of which is pivoted to an upright reciprocating
shaft, as described." The specification of the patent was illustrated by the annexed drawing.

The defendant then introduced evidence tending to show
that the machine, the use of which by him was charged by
the plaintiff to be an infringement on his reissued letters patent,
was constructed according to the patent of John Torrent just
described.
The evidence having been closed, the defendant asked the
court to charge the jury"That in view of the pleadings and proof, and the claims
and disclaimers of the plaintiff regarding the portion of his
patent claimed to be infringed, the jury are instructed to render a verdict for the defendant."

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

The court refused to give this charge. After receiving the
charge of the court upon the case, as presented by the pleadings and evidence, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff
for $960, on which the court rendered. judgment. This writ of
error brought up that judgment for review.

error.

in error.
'MR. JUSTICE WOODs delivered the opinion of the court. He
recited the facts as above stated, akd continued:
, The refusal of the court to direct the jury to return
a verdict

for the defendant is, among other things, assigned for error.
We think the charge requested should have been given, bebause, in our opinion, the first claim of the reissued patent,
which is the only one that the plaintiff insisted had been infringed, is void.
. The testimony showed that it was the practice in saw-mills
to "slab" the logs after they were placed on the qarriage, that
is, to saw off slabs on two or four sides of the log To ac-,
complish this it was necessary that the log should be turned
on the carriage. An inspection of the drawings and specification of Esau Tarrant's original patent shows that his device
was for the trning of logs upon, their axes when placed upon
the carriage of a saw-mill, so that the opposite parts of the log
might be successively presented to the saw and slabs cut therefrom. It was no part of the purpose of the contrivance to roll
the log from one place to another, as from one part of the logdeck to another, or from the log-deck to the carriage. On the
contrary, the drawing shows that the device was so made as to
prevent the rolling of the log from one place to another. This
was accomplished by knees considerably higher than the diameter of the log; against which the log was pressed, and which
held it in position and formed part of the means by which the
log was made to revolve on its axis. When placed in contact
with the knees, the log was in the right position to be subjected

TORRENT COMPANY v. RODGERS.
Opinion of the Court.

to the action of the saw. It is not possible with this device
to roll the log from one place to another except by raising it,
if that could be done, to the top of the knees and tumbling it
over them to the other side; and, if this were done, it would
defeat the object of the invention by moving the log off the
carriage and away from the saw.
In the reissue the specification is modified so as to make a
radical change, not only in the purpose, but in the mechanism
of the invention. In the original patent the invention was declared to be an improved device for turning or rolling logs
upon the carriage of a saw-mill. In the reissue the invention
was declared to be a device for turning or rolling logs to or
upon the carriage. The device, as described in the reissued
patent, is adapted, not only to turn logs on their axes, but
to roll them from one place to another, as from one part of
the log-deck to another, or from the log-deck to and' upon the
carriage. This requires a change of mechanism. To turn a
log when on the carriage without change of its location requires that the toothed-bar should be placed as closely as possible to the side, or within the side~of, the carriage, and there
must be knees to prevent a change in the location of the log.
To roll a log to the carriage, or to roll a log from the log-deck
upon the carriage, the toothed-bar must be at a distance from
the carriage at least as great as the diameter of the log, and
the slot in which it works must be extended accordingly, and
the knees are not only unnecessary, but would be an obstruction to the operation of the device.
The movement of a toothed-bar in turning a log on a carriage against the resistance of the knees is necessarily in the
same plane, while the movement of a toothed-bar in rolling a
log toward or upon a carriage is necessarily in constantly
changing planes, as the bar follows the changing position of
the log.
The change of the specification, therefore, includes an omission of the knees, a change in the location of the toothed-bar,
a change in its movements, and a change in the effect produced
by its movements. The reissue, consequently, covers a different invention from that described in the original patent. It

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

embaces a different machine, intended for different purposes
and performing different functions, from that described in the
original patent.
When we turn to the claims of the reissued patent we find a
corresponding enlargement of the scope of the patent. The
claims of the, original patent are substantially reproduced in
the reissued patent, except that a combination instead of an
arrangement of the different parts was claimed. But a new
claim is added, namely, the first, which is as follows: "The
toothed-bar herein described operating,substantially in the manner and for the purpose described."
- Each of the claims of the original patent was for a combination. But the first claim of the reissue covers the toothed-bar
operating substantially in the manner described, without reference to the mechanism by which it was moved, segregated
from the combination and claimed as a distinct invention of the
{atentee.
The operation of the toothed-bar is enlarged in the first claim
of the reissue. In the original patent it was used in connection
with the knees set upon the log carriage to prevent the log
changing its place and to aid in giving the log a rotary motion
on its axis. In the first claim of the reissue, construed in connection with the changed specification, the toothed-bar may be
used with or without the knees. The knees are used when the
toothed-bar is employed for revolving the log on its axis, and
they are omitted when the toothed-bar is used for rolling the
log over and moving it from one place to another. Both the
specification and claims of the reissue are enlarged to include
an invention not described or included in the original patent.
The application of 3 ohn Torrent for his patent dated August
12, 1873, was filed January 29, 1873. The invention covered
by his patent was the alleged infringing machine used by the
defendant. After the patent of John Torrent had been applied
for, and his invention fully described in his application, and
nearly five years after the grant of the original'letters patent
to Esau Torrent, the latter applied for the reissue with its expanded specification and claims. The reissue was clearly intended to forestall John Torrent's invention and include it in

TORRENT COM3PANY v. RODGERS.
Opinion of the Court.

the claims of the reissued patent of Esau Tarrant. We find,
therefore, that the specification and first claim of the reissue
was an enlargement of the claims of the original patent, and
covered an invention not covered or described therein ; that the
reissue was not applied for until nearly five years after the date
of the original patent, and not until another inventor had made
a substantial advance in the art to which the original patent
belonged, which the assignee of the original invention, it may
be fairly inferred, desired to include in the monopoly of his
patent, and that he sought to accomplish this by its reissue.
The first claim of the ieissued patent was therefore void. This
conclusion is sustained by many decisions of this court, some of
which may.be found in the following cases: Gill v. Wells, 22
Wall. 1; Miood Paper Patent,23 Wall. 566; Powder Co. v.
Powder Wlorks, 98 U. S. 126; Ball v. Langles, 102 U. S. 128;
James v. Campbell, 104 U. S. 356; .feald v. Rice, 104 U. S.
737; Xiller v. Brass Co., 104 U. S. 350; Johnson v; Railroad
Co., 105 U. S. 539 ; Bantz v. .Frantz,105 U. S. 160; Wing v.
Anthony, 106 U. S. 142. Especial attention is called to three
decisions of this court which are peculiarly apposite: Cements
v. Odorless Excavating Co., 109 U. S. 641 ; Xcffour'ray v. -Mallory, 111 U. S. 96, and .Mfahnv. Harwood, ante, 354.
It follows, from the views we have exTressed, that the platntiff below failed to show any cause of action against the defendant. The court should, therefore, have. charged the jury,
as requested, to return a verdict for the defendant. Its refusal
to do so was error, for which
The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court, with instructions to grant a new trial.
