Statement of the Case.

UNITED STATES v. VAN DUZEE.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 604. Submitted and argued' March 24, 1902.-Decided April 28,1902.

Section 19 of the act of May 28, 1896, c. 252, providing that "the terms of
office of all commissioners of the Circuit Courts heretofore appointed
shall expire on the thirtieth day of June, 1897, . . . and said commissioners shall then deposit all the records and other official papers
appertaining to their offices in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court,
by which they were appointed," not having authorized the filing of the
writings in question, and no provision having been made for compensating the clerk for the service of receiving them and retaining them in his
custody, the Court of Claims erred in awarding judgment in favor of the
claimant.

THIs is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims

entered in favor of the appellee (claimant below) for the sum
of $993. 35 C. Cl. 214. The conclusion of law by which the
court determined that judgment ought to be entered against
the United States was based upon the following:
"Finding of Facts.

"I. The claimant, Alonzo J. Van Duzee, was clerk of the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District
of Iowa from August, 1882, to December 31, 1897, duly qualified and acting.
"II. During said period he made up his accounts for services
rendered on behalf of the United States, and presented the
same, duly verified, to the United States court for approval in
the presence of the district attorney, and orders approving the
same as being just and according to law were entered of record.
Said accounts were then presented to the accounting officers of
the Treasury Department for payment. In the settlement of
the account from July 1, 1897, to September 30, 1897, part was
paid, but payment of services embraced in Finding III was refused.
"III. Item 1. For filing and entering 9930 separate and dis-

of commissioners of the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of Iowa, which were deposited by said
commissioners under the act of May 28, 1896, in the office of

"IV. During the period when the aforesaid services were

rendered, it was the settled practice under the verbal orders of
the court for the clerk to file all papers sent up by the commissioners in said district; and by a written rule of court entered
of record, it was made the duty of the clerk in cases wherein
the commissioner held the defendant to appear at court to file
the papers and transcripts sent up by the commissioner, and to
forthwith enter the case on the docket, which rule is as follows:
cc'Commissioneg.s 2aers.

Upon receipt by the clerk of the papers and transcript of
proceedings before a commissioner, wherein the party is held to
appear at court, the same shall be properly filed and the same
entered upon the docket.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

"The aforesaid services were performed in compliance with
said practice and rule of court."
.Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradtsubmitted for appellant. -M. Ptili, .A[ Ashford was on his brief.
.Ar. Charles 0. Lancaster'for appellee.
MR. JUSTIcE WHITE, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The question involves the construction .of a portion of paragraph 19 of the act of Congress of May 28, 1896, 29 Stat. 184,
which reads as follows:
"That the terms of office of all commissioners of the Circuit
Courts heretofore appointed shall expire on the thirtieth day of
June, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven; and such office shall
on that day cease to exist, and said commissioners shall then
deposit all the records and other official papers appertaining to
their offices in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court by
which they were appointed. All proceedings pending, returnable, unexecuted, or unfinished at said date before any such coinmissioner shall be continued and disposed of according to law
by such commissioner appointed as herein provided, as may be
designated by the District Court for that purpose."
Upon the assumption that the Government had not appealed
from a judgment rendered against it, in Marsh v. United States,
88 Fed. Rep. 879, 890, item 57, upon a claim similar to that
now being considered, the Court of Claims, in the case at bar,
adopted the decision in the case referred to, and held that the
provision of the act of 1896, above quoted, authorized the filing by the claimant of all papers deposited with him in accordance with the requirements of the act, and that by such deposit
they became part of the records and files of the court of which
he was clerk. The United States, however, on a motion for a
new trial directed attention to the fact that the court had mistakenly supposed that the decision in the 2larssh case had been
acquiesced in, since proceedings to review the judgment in that
case were then pending in the proper Circuit Court of Appeals.

UNITED STATES u. VAN DUZEE.
Opinion of the Court.

We are unable to concur in the construction of the statute
thus adopted by the court below. As said by Mr. Justice Jackson, in United States v. Shields, 153 U. S. 88, 91: "Fees allowed
to public officers are matters of strict law, depending upon the
very provisions of the statute. They are not open to equitable
construction by the courts, nor to any discretionary action on
the part of the officers." Now, the act of 1896 did not expressly
provide that the papers to be surrendered by the commissioners
to the custody of the clerk should befled by the latter, and we
are unable to infer from the language employed that such a
direction was given. Congress, having abolished the office of
Circuit Court commissioner, naturally deemed it expedient to
provide for the safekeeping of the dockets, records and official
papers of those officers. It, therefore, directed that upon the
cessation of such offices, the commissioners should "deposit"
the official documents in their possession with the "clerk of the
Circuit Court by which they were appointed." No good purpose would have been subserved by the formal filing of these
dockets and writings, which, in the ordinary course, never would
have been forwarded to the clerk for filing, and, hence, the construction which attributes to the word "deposit," as used in the
statute, a meaning synonymous with "filing," is strained.
So, also, the legal conclusion embodied in the fourth finding,
to the effect that the services of the claimant were performed in
compliance with a rule of court promulgated prior to May 28,
1896, was erroneous. The documents in question were not covered by the rule, which plainly had relation only to the current
business of the Circuit Court commissioners.
The statute which directed the deposit not having authorized
the filing of the writings in question, and no provision having
been made for compensating the clerk for the service of receiving and retaining them in his custody, the Court of Claims erred
in awarding judgment in favor of the claimant. United States
v. Patterson,150 U. S. 65, 69; Rev. Stat. sec. 1761.
The decree of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause
is remanded to that court with instructions to render judgment for the United States.
