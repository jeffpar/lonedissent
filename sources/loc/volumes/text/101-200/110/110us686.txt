with this case as it is now presented. The question here is
whether the Denver & New Orleans Company would have
the right to the relief it asks if there were no such contract, not
whether the contract, if it exists, will be a bar to such a right.
The real question in the case, as it now comes before us, is
whether the relief required is legislative in its character or
judicial. We think it is legislative, and that upon the existing
facts a court of chancery can afford no remedy.
The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause

DALLAS COUNTY v.MCKENZIE.
IN

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF Z1[SSOURI.
Submitted January 16th, 1884.-Decided ?Jurch ad, 1884.

*Evdence-ffunicipalBo &d.
Bails oun4lv. Douglas, 105 U. S. 728, relating to bonds in counties in Issouri
issued in payment of subscriptions to railway stock, approved and followed.
farcy v. Township of Oswego, 93 U. S. 687, HumboM Township v. Long, 92
U. S. 642. and Wilson v. Salaman a, 99 U. S. 499, relating to the validity
of such bonds in the hands of a bona fide holder, approved and followed.
When the records of a County Court show that orders for subscriptions to stock
were made at adjourned and special terms at which all the judges were
present, and that the last order was made at a regular term, it will be presumed, in the absence of anything to the contrary, that the adjourned and
special terms were regularly called and held.

This was an action to recover the amounts due on interest
coupons of municipal bonds issued in payment of a subscription
for $85,000 to railway stock.

The bonds contained the follow-

ing recital:
"This bond is is#aed pursuant to an order of the County Court
of the county of Dallas, made on the 18th of May, A. D. 1871, and
amended on the 19th of June, A.D. 1871, and on the 12th of
August, A. D. 1871.'

DALLAS COUNTY v. McKENZIE.

687

Opinion of the Court
There was no vote of the taxpayers of the county to authorize the sfbscription. The order of the County Court made on
the 18th May, purported to be made at "1an adjourned term."
The record did not show how this became an adjourned term.
It was assigned as error that "the Circuit Court erred in admitting in evidence the orders of the County Court of Dallas
County over the objections of plaintiff in error."
Mr. John P. Ellis for plaintiff in error.
.Xr.J. B. Henderson,.Arf. Tkomas C. Pletcher and MrM.Geo.
AD.Reynolds for defendant in error.

MP.CrIEF JusTIC. WArE delivered the opinion of the court.
It is no longer an open question in this court that bonds
issued by counties in Missouri, during the years 1870 and 1871,
in payment of subscriptions to the stock of railroad companies
without a vote of the people, are valid if the subscription was
made under authority granted before the adoption of the Constitution of 1865 which did not require such a vote to be taken.
In Balls County v. -Douglass,105 U. S. 128, the cases in th
Supreme Court of the State and in this court'bearing on that
question are referred to, and our conclusion distinctly stated.
'We there declined to follow the case of State v. Dallas County
Court, 72 Mo. 329, decided in 1878, which substantially overruled a long line of cases in the Supreme Court of the State
on which our earlier "decisions were predicated.
In .Marcyv. Townsh.p of Oswego, 92 U. S. 637, and Humboldt
Township v. Long, lb. 642, followed in WN78on v. Salamanca,99
U. S. 499, it was expressly decided that municipal bonds were
not invalid in the hands of a bona fide holder, by reason of their
having been voted and issued in excess of the statutory limit,
if the recitals imported a valid issue. It is an admittecd fact in
this case that McKenzie, the defendant in error, is a bona ftde
Iwoldej for value of the coupons sued on, and the recitals, which
are almost in the exact language of th6se in Wilson v. Salamanca, supra, imply authority for the issue of the bonds from
which they were cut. Consequently, in this case, the excessive
issue is no defence.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Syllabus.

The records of the County Court which were put in evidence
show affirmatively that all the justices were present and acting
at the adjourned and special terms, when the orders were made
directing the subscription to the stock and providing as to the
terms of the contract. The last order was made at a regular
term. Under these circumstances, it is certainly to be presumed,
in the absence of anything to the contrary, that the terms were
regularly called and held. It was, therefore, not error to admit
the records in evidence without proof 6f the order for the adjourned term, or the call for the special term. The fact that
the order of the 7th of August, 1871, is referred to in the
recitals of the bond as having been made on the 12th, is unimportant. Smith v. County of Clark, 54 Mo. 58.
The judgment is affirmwd.
