IN ERROR TO THE SUPE=

COURT OF THE STATE

OF IOWA.

Argued December 6th ana 7th, 1883.-Decided January7th, 1884.

Land Grants-Bairoads--ktalutes.
1. It has been the invariable policy of Congress to measure the amount of
public lands granted to a land-grant railroad by the length of the road
as actually constructed, and not by its length as originally located ; and
there is nothing in the statutes of Congress or of the State of Iowa applicable to the grant of public lands in favor of the plaintiffs in error
which indicates a different purpose, or which warrants the claim that
the number of sections which they are entitled to receive is to be estimated by the standard of the original location of the road.
2. When Congress grants to a State for a railroad company every alternate
section of land designated by odd numbers within a given distance from
the line of the road, and directs the Secretary of the Interior, when a
map shall be filed in that department, showing the location of the road,
to reserve the sections, and further provides that in case it is found that
the United States had disposed of any of these odd sections, or rights attached to them, by pre-emption or otherwise, the grantee may select
other alternate odd sections within another and greater distance from
that line, the filing of the map cuts off the right of entry.of the odd
sections within the first named distance ; but it confers no rights to
specified tracts within the' secondary or indemnity tract, until the

grantee's right of selection has been exercised ; and that right cannot be
exercised until the entire road has been completed.
8. The act of June 2d, 1864, ยง 4, 13 Stat. 96, 97, construed.

These are ten writs of error to the Supreme Court of the
State of Iowa to review judgments in that court of amfrmance
in favor of the parties named. The railroad company was
plaintiff in the inferior State court, and on appeal in the
Supreme Court of the State, and in the writs of erro.- in this
court.
The suit in the court of original jurisdiction was in the nature of a bill in chancery to quiet title, and to compel a conveyance of the legal title held by defendants under patents
from.the United States to plaintiff, who assprted title to it in
equity.
The cases all depend on the same pleadings and evidence,
and were consolidated in the inferior court, and have been considered and argued together in the Supreme Court of Iowa,
and in this court, except No. 1139, the Jewell case, which is
submitted in this court on the same argument.

M . usTicE: MILER delivered the opinion of the court.
The defendants are in possession of the land in controversy in
each case under a purchase from the'United States with a patent from the government, and the plaintiff, the railroad company, asserts a superior title, either legal or equitable, under
certain land grants by act of Congress to aid in building railroads. The first of these acts is that of May 15th, 1856, 11
Stat.. 9, by which Congress granted lands lying within the
State of Iowa to that State to aid in building four principal
railroads from the Mississippi to the Missouri River. One of
these .was for a road "from Lyons City, on the Mississippi
River, to a point of intersection with the main line of the
Iowa Central Air Line Railroad near Maquaketa, thence on
said main line, running as near as practicable to the 42d parallel across the said State to the Missouri River." For each of

Opinion of the Court.
these roads there was given to the State of Iowa, "as soon as
the road is completed, every alternate section of land designated by odd numbers for six sections in width on each side of
each of said roads." And it was provided that if, when the
line of a road was definitely located, it was found that the
United States had disposed of any of these odd sections, or
rights had attached to them by pre-emption or otherwise, an
agent appointed by the State might, in lieu of these, select
other alternate sections anywhere within fifteen miles of the
line of the road.
The State of Iowa, by an act of the general assembly approved July 14th, 1856, accepted the trust reposed in it by the
above act of Congress, and granted and conferred upon four
corporations all these lands, under the terms and restrictions of
the act of Congress. These corporations were to construct the
roads across the State according to that act, and the corporation on whom was conferred the grant for a road from Lyons
to the Missouri River was the Iowa Central Air Line Railroad
Company.
The only result of this particular grant of the State was that
the company received the 120 sections of land which this court
held, in the case of the RailroadLand Comvany v. Courtright,
21 Wall. 310, could be secured before any road was built; but
having built no road up to March 1Tth, 1860, the State, by an
act of its legislature of that date, declared the grant forfeited
and resumed control of it.
On the 26th of that month, by another act of assembly, the
State granted the same lands to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri
River Railroad Company-the plaintiff in error-upon conditions similar in all material respects to the grant to the Air
Line Company.
The Air Line Company had before this time surveyed and
located the line of the road from Lyons to the Missouri River
through the town of Cedar Rapids, and the map of this survey
and location had been accepted by the State of Iowa and the
Land Office of the United States as the true line and as governing the location of the land grant for that road. A road
had also been built by another company, the Chicago, Iowa

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

and Nebraska, which had no land grant, from a point on the
Mississippi River within three miles of Lyons City to Cedar
Rapids. Hence the grant of the State to the Cedar Rapids
Company required them to build speedily from Cedar Rapids
west along the line thus adopted to the Missouri River.
Under this arrangement the Cedar Rapids Company pushed
its road on the designated line, so that it had completed about
a hundred miles west of the town of that name by the year
1864, when several matters seemed to call for legislation by
Congress in regard to it and to the other companies building
roads across the State under the grants of the act of 1856.
As regards the Cedar Rapids Company, it had become clearly
unnecessary to build another road from the Mississippi at Lyons
to Cedar Rapids, along the line occupied by the Iowa and
Nebraska road.
It had also become apparent that a shorter and better line to
the Missouri River could be had from the point to which the
road had now been constructed, and it was thought that a
road from some point on its existing line to some point south of
'it, on the line of the Mississippi and Missouri River Railroadone of the four land-grant roads-would be desirable. It had
also been ascertained that the necessary qtiantity of lands in
lieu of the odd sections disposed of within six miles could not
be satisfied by al n~te sections within the fifteen-mile limit.
In this condition of the matter Congress passed the statute
on which the result of this litigation depends, which was apm
proved June 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 95.
This statute, after granting certain relief to the Mississippi
and Missouri Railroad Company, and to the Burlington and
Missouri Railroad Company, two other of the land-grant roads
in Iowa, proceeds in its fourth section to grant relief to the
present plaintiff company.
The fourth section of that act-the one which we are required
to construe-reads as follows:
"SEc. 4. And be it further enacted, That the Cedar Rapids
and Missouri River Railroad Company, a corporation established
under the laws of the State of Iowa, and to which the said State

granted a portion of the land mentioned in the title of this act,
may modify or change the location of the uncompleted portion of
its line, as shown by the map thereof, now on file in the General
Land Office of the United States, so as to secure a better and
more expeditious line to the Missouri River and to a connection
with the Iowa branch of the Union Pacific Railroad; and for the
purpose of facilitating the more immediate construction of a line
of railroads across the State of Iowa, to connect with the Iowa
branch of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, aforesaid, the
said Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company is
hereby authorized to connect its line by a branch with the line of
the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company; and the said
Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company shall be
entitled, for such modified line, to the same lands and to the same
amount of lands per mile, and for such connecting branch the
same amount of land per mile, as originally granted to aid in the
construction of its main line, subject to the conditions and forfeitures mentioned in the original grant, and, for the same purpose,
right of way through the public lands of the United States is
hereby granted to said company. And it is further pyrovided,
That whenever said modified main line shall have been established
or such connecting line located, the said Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company shall file in the General Land Office
of the United States a map definitely showing such modified line
and such connecting branch aforesaid; and the Secretary of the
Interior shall reserve and cause to be certified and conveyed to
said company, from time to time, as the work progresses on the
main line, out of any public lands now belonging to the United
States, not sold, reserved, or otherwise disposed of, or to which a
pre-emption right or right of homestead settlement has not attached, and on which a bona fide settlement and improvement
has not been made under color of title derived from the United
States or from the State of Iowa, within fifteen miles of the
original main line an amount of land equal to that originally
authorized to be granted to aid in the construction of the said
road by the act to which this is an amendment. And if the
amount of land per mile granted, or intended to be granted by
the original act, to aid in the construction of said railroad, shall
not be found within the limits of the fifteen miles therein prescribed, then such selections may be made along said modified

however, That such new located or modified line shall pass through
or near Boonesboro, in Boone County, and intersect the Boyer
River not further south than a point at or near Dennison, in
Crawford County: And providedfurther, That in case the main
line shall be so changed and modified as not to reach the Missouri
River at or near the 42d parallel north latitude, it shall be the
duty of said company, within a reasonable time after the completion of its road to the Missouri River, to construct a branch
road to some point in Monona County, in or at Onawa City; and
to aid in the construction of such branch the same amount of lands
per mile are hereby granted as for the main line, and the same
shall be reserved and certified in the same manner; said lands to
be selected from any of the unappropriated lands as hereinbefore
described, within'twenty miles of said main line and branch; and
said company shall file with the Secretary of the Interior a map
of the location of said branch: And provided further, That the
lands hereby granted to aid in the construction of the connecting
branch aforesaid shall not vest in said company nor be encumbered or disposed of except in the following manner: When the
Governor of the State of Iowa shall certify to the Secretary of
the Interior that the said company has completed in good running
order a section of twenty consecutive miles of the main line of
said road west of Nevada, then the Secretary shall convey to said
company one-third, and no more, of the lands granted for said
connecting branch. And when said company shall complete an
additional section of twenty consecutive miles, and furnish the
Secretary of the Interior with proof as aforesaid, then the said
Secretary may convey to the said company another third of the
lands for said connecting branch; and when said company shall
complete an additional section of twenty miles, making in all
sixty miles west of Nevada, the Secretary, upon proof furnished
as aforesaid, may convey to the said company the remainder of
said lands to aid in the construction of said connecting branch:

of the State of Iowa shall certify to the Secretary of the Interior
that the same shall have been completed as a first-class railroad.

Opinion of the Court.
Missouri Railroad as laid down on a map on file in the General
Land Office: Provided,further, That it shall be the duty of the
Secretary of the Interior, and he is hereby required, to reserve a
quantity of land embraced in the grant described in this section,
sufficient in the opinion of the Governor of Iowa, to secure the
construction of a branch road from the town of Lyons, in the
State of Iowa, so as to connect with the main line in or west of
the town of Clinton, in said State, until the Governor of said State
shall certify that said branch railroad is completed according to
the requirements of the laws of said State: Providedfurther,That
nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to release said
company from its obligation to complete the said main line within
the time mentioned in the original grant: Providedfurther,That
nothing in this act shall be construed to interfere with or in any
manner impair any rights acquired by any railroad company
named in the act to which this is an amendment, or the rights of
any corporation, person or persons, acquired through any such
company; nor shall it be construed to impair any vested right of
property, but such rights are hereby reserved and confirmed:
Provided, however, That no lands shall be conveyed to any company or party whatsoever, under the provisions of this act and
the act amended by this act, which have been settled upon and
improved in good faith by a bonafide inhabitant, under color of
title derived from the United States or from the State of Iowa
adverse to the grant made by this act or the act to which this act
is an amendment. But each of said companies may select an
equal quantity of public lands as described in this act within the
distance of twenty miles of the line of each of said roads in lieu
of said lands thus settled upon and improved by bonafide inhabitants in good faith under color of title as aforesaid."
We are of opinion that the purpose of this enactment was1. To relieve the company from the obligation to build that
part of its line as found in the land office, between the Mississippi River and Cedar Rapids, because there already existed a
road between those points built by another corporation.
2. To require the company to connect the city of Lyons with
that corporation's road, so that it would be, as originally
intended, the Mississippi terminus of the land-grant road across
vol. cx-3

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

the State. This required the construction of about two and a
half miles of road.
3. To authorize the company to change the location of its
road yet to be constructed west of Cedar Rapids for its convenience.
4. If this change left the city of Onawa, in Monona County,
off the line of the road, they were to build a branch to that
place.
5. To construct a new line connecting its existing road with
the road from Davenport on the Mississippi River, to Council
Bluffs, on the Missouri River.
6. To adjust the amount of lands, to which the company
would be entitled under this new order of things, and to enlarge
the source from which selections might be made for the loss of
that not found in place.
This latter it accomplished by declaring that aZI the sections
within the fifteen-mile limits shall be subject to such selection
on the same terms on which only alternate sections could previously be selected; and if this limit, which had exclusive
reference to the line first located, 'did not satisfy the grant,
then selection could be made within twenty miles of the new line.
Before proceeding further it,is as well to say that the short
road connecting the Iowa and Nebraska line with Lyons City
was built, the connection with the Mississippi and Missouri
River road was not built, and though the new line was
located fifteen miles or more from Onawa, the branch to that
city was not built. The road of this company, as originally
located, from Lyons City to the Missouri River, was three
hundred and forty-five (345) miles in length, and as constructed
by the company, from Cedar Rapids to the Missouri River, it
is two hundred and seventy-one (271) miles long, making a difference of seventy-four (74) miles.
The plaintiff in error insists that, under the act of 1864, it is
entitled to six sections per mile, as measured by the original
location of the road, while defendants assert that the length of
the road, as constructed by the plaintiff, is to be taken as determining the quantum of the grant.
This is the first and most important question in the case, as

CEDAR RAPIDS, &c., RAILROAD v. HERRING.

35

Opinion of the Court.
argued by counsel, and decided by the Supreme Court of Iowa
in favor of the latter proposition, and its importance depends
upon the fact asserted by defendants, that the company has
received all the land it is entitled to, without resorting to that
which they have purchased from the government, and for which
they hold its patents. Manifestly, if this be so, plaintiff can
have no just claim upon the lands of defendants, though they
are all located within the fifteen-mile limit and outside of the
six-mile limit.
It is believed that in no instance of the many grants of public
land made by Congress to aid in building railroads, has the
quantity been measured by any other rule than the length of
the road constructed, or required to be constructed, by the
grantee or its privy; and it would be the first departure from
this principle known to us if in this case Congress intended to
give the same amount per mile of land fpr road not constructed,
and from the construction of which the grantee at its own request was released, as for road which it was required to build
and which it actually built. In the case of the additional road
required to be built, as the Onawa branch, and in the new
branch authorized to connect the main line with the Mississippi and Missouri River road, the old rule is adhered to, and a
grant made of six sections per mile of this additional road which
should be actually constructed. It would therefore require very
plain language in that part of the act of 1864 which defines the
quantity of land to be taken by the company, under these new
circumstances, to justify us in holding it to cover six sections
per mile for road never to be constructed by this company,
from the obligation to construct which it was relieved by this
very act, and which was then already built by another company
having no privity with the grantee in this case.
So far, however, from finding this plain language favoring
that view, we are of opinion that its fair construction is in accord with the uniform policy of Congress on this subject, and
with what the circumstances suggest as the reasonable intent of
that body.
The section of the act which we have copied, after authorizing the change in the location of the line of the road and the

Opinion of the Court.

connection with the line of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company, says:
"And the said Cedar Rapids and Mlissouri River Railroad
Company shall be entitled for such modflfed line to the same
lands, and to the same amount of land per mile, and for such
connecting branch to the same amount of land per mile, as orig-

inally granted to aid in the construction of its main line."
If Congress simply meant that the company, notwithstanding the change in the line of its road, should have the lands it
would have had if it had built the whole of the original line, it
would have been easy to exTress this purpose. In such case
no descriltion of the grant, as for such modified line, nor of
mile, would have been necesthe same amount of lands per the
use of this language was
sary. If such was the purpose,
unnecessary and was confusing. If, however, it was the purpose of Congress to measure this grant under the new circumstances by the length of the modified line and give the same
number of sections per.mile of the line thus modified, the language is, in our opinion, appropriate and unaibiguous. The
words "the same lands," which plaintiff's counsel insist mean
all the lands of the old grant, are intended, we think, to show
that the lands are to be taken along the line of the old survey;
that the odd sections on each side of that old line which became vested in the State when it was established should be a
part of the new grant to this company, and that the deficienoies should in like manner be made up by sections within the
fifteen-mile limit of that line. This is confirmed by that part
of the next sentence of this section, which directs the Secretary of the Interior, when the new line shall have been established, to reserve all the lands without regard to alternate sections within that limit, so far as may be necessary to satisfy
these selections, for the loss of -odd sections previously disposed of.
We see no error, therefore, in .the ruling of the Supreme
Court of Iowa that the quantity of the grant is to be determined by the length of the new lines, as constructed by the
company.

CEDAR RAPIDS, &c., RAILROAD v. HERRING.
Opinion of

37

the Court

The plaintiff, however, insists that, adopting this principle,
there is still a deficiency of the grant of 292,019 acres, to supply which it is entitled to resort to the lands now in possession
of defendant. The Supreme Court of Iowa, in the opinion delivered in the nine cases decided in 1879, conceded that the
company had not received the full amount it was entitled to
on this basis by about 5,000 acres, but as it had seleted lands
enough, not including those of defendants, and had not shown
that those selections had been abandoned by the company, or.
disallowed by the land department, they had not shown a case
for relief against the defendants.
In the case of Jewell, decided by that court in 1883, it is
shown by a discussion of the deductions claimed by plaintiff,
that 24,000 acres have been selected and claimed in excess of
what the company is entitled to.
The questions on which these deductions depend, and what
weight is to be given to the selection of other lands not yet
certified to the company or approved by the Secretary of the
Interior, are not free from difficulty, and are to us much more
embarrassing than one which the Supreme Court in its last
opinion seemed to have encountered and been unable to decide. In that opinion it is said:
"The counsel for the respective parties have discussed with
great lIearning and ability the nature of the right which the railroad company acquired in the land in question by the passage of
the act. We do not care to go into a consideration of this question. The company, doubtless, as against the United States, acquired, upon the construction of the road, the right to select and
claim the land as a part of the intended indemnity, if the deficiency was such as to justify it. What right the company acquired previous to selection as against the defendant, a homestead
settler, is a question which presents no little embarrassment, and
upon which there is not, perhaps, entire harmony in the adjudication. As to this we are not at present entirely agreed. For the
purpose of the opinion it may be conceded that the plaintiffs
would be entitled to resort to this land if it were necessary to fill
the required indemnity. But it will not be denied that if the indemnity has been filled, the interest in the land which the plain-

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

tiffs may have had prior thereto would be extinguished. As to
whether it has been filled the parties differ widely. They differ,
also, as to who has the burden of proof upon such question."
In the case of Grinnell v. The Railroad Conpany, 103

U. S. 39, this court said, in construing the granting clause of
the original act of Mfay 15th, 1856:
"1So far as lands are found in place whenever this is done"
(that is, the location of the road filed in the proper office), "not
coming within the exceptions as sold or held under pre-emption,
the title, or at least the right, to this land in place is at once vested
in the State or in the company to which the State has granted it,
and the means of ascertaining precisly what lands have passed by
the grant is to be found in the map of the line of the road, which
is filed in the General Land Office under provisions of the statute.
As regards the lands to be selected in lieu of those lost by sale or
otherwise, it may be that no valid right accrues to any particular
section or part of a section, until the selection is made and reported to the land office, and possibly not then until the selection
is approved by the proper officer."
In the case of 'an Tyck v. -Enev&s, 106 U. S. 360, the
subject is discussed with exclusive reference to the old-numbered sections specifically granted, and it is there held that the
adoption by the company of a surveyed line of the route of its
road, and the filing of the map of the same with the Secretary of the Interior, cuts off the right of entry of these odd sections by any one else, whether there is a proclamation or order
withdrawing them or not.
It is obvious, however, that the right to these odd sections,
and the right to others in lieu of such odd sections as have
been previously disposed. of, depend upon very different circumstances, and it is not easy to see how rights can be vested
in any particular section or sections of the latter class until
it is ascertained how many of the original odd-numbered sections are thus lost, and until the grantee has exercised his
right of selection.
These latter, unlike the odd numbers within the six-mile
limit, are not ascertained and made specific by the protraction

CEDAR RAPIDS, &c., RAILROAD v.HERRING.

39

Opinion of the Court.
of the established line through the maps of the public lands.
They are not and cannot be made specific until the grantee's
right of selection has been exercised.
This court, in construing the same clause of the grant to the
California and Oregon Railroad Company, 14 Stat. 239, said:
"1When the road was located and the maps were made, the right
of the company to the odd sections first named became i2)so facto
fixed and absolute. With respect to the Ilieu lands,' as they are
called, the right was only a float, and attached, to no specified
tracts until the selection was actually made in the manner prescribed."
Again:
"It was within the secondary or indemnity territory where that
deficiency was to be supplied. The railroad company had not
and could not have any claim to it until specially selected, as it
was for that purpose." Ryan v. Railroad Company, 99 U. S.
382.
But from what shall the selection be made, and how long a
tiine may the grantee have to make his selection?
The question presents itself in two aspects, namely, the right
to make these selections as against the United States, the
grantor of this right, and the right as against a purchaser
from the United States before the selection is made. As regards the former, it is only important to consider when it commences in the present case, and we are of opinion that no right
of selection in any of these lands accrues until the entire line
of the road to be built has been established by the company,
and filed in the General Land Office at Washington, and that
until then no duty devolves on the Secretary to withdraw or
withhold tbe land from sale or pre-emption.
This is the necessary inference from the language both of
the original grant of 1856 and the amendatory act of 1864.
The first declares:
"In case it shall appear that the United States have, when the
lines and routes of said roads are definitely fixed, sold any sections

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

or parts thereof granted as aforesaid, or that rights of pre-emption
have attached to the same, then, it shall be lawful for any agent
or agents, to be appointed by the Governor of said State, to select
other lands."
It is only when the line and routes of the roads are definitely
fixed that any right of selection exists. This must necessarily
be so, because until then the quantity of land lost by the previous disposition of the odd sections cannot be known, and the
number of sections to be selected can only then be ascertained.
And the act of 1864, under which plaintiff's claim can alone
exist, while it directs the Secretary to withdraw from sale the
lands from which these selections are to be made, only requires
this to be done after the new line of the road shall have been
so established.
The language is:
"And it is further provided, that whenever said modified main
line shall have been established, or such connecting line located,
the said Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company
shall file in the General Land Office of the United States a map
definitely showing such modified line and such connecting branch
as aforesaid, and the Secretary of the Interior shall reserve and
cause to be certified and conveyed to said company, from time to
time as the work progresses on the main line, out of any public
lands now belonging to the United States not sold, reserved, or
otherwise disposed of, . . . within fifteen miles of the original main line, an amount equal to that originally authorized."
It seems to us quite plain that, as in the original grant, no
obligation on the Secretary to reserve any of this land from
sale arises until the new line is established, that is, surveyed,
approved by the directors, and filed in the General Land Office.
Such is the language of the statute, and the reason for it is the
same as in the original statute, that, as the number of sections
the company would be entitled to could not be known until
this was done and the length of the road ascertained, the Secretary could not know how much land it was necessary to reserve
to satisfy the demand. Of course until this was done the sec-

Opinion of the Court.

tions not included within the six-mile limit were open to sale
and pre-emption. The time when it became the duty of the
land officers to suspend these sales was under the control of
the company, for whenever they established and filed in the
General Land Office a.map "definitely showing this modified
line of their road," the duty of the Secretary arose, and not
until then.
This was not done until December 1st, 1867, three years and
a half after the passage of the act requiring it to be done, under which plaintiff's rights accrued. It is true a map of part
of the line was filed in 1865, but this can in no sense be said
to be a map definitely showing the modified line of the road.
It showed only a part of it, and left the Secretary in ignorance
where the road would yet be carried to, and what quantity of
land it would be entitled to when finished. In all these cases
the requirement has been of a map of the line of the road-of
the whole road, not part of it; a complete, not a partial, map;
a map definitely showing that line, as the language clearly
means.
It was during this delay of three years and a half that the
entries were made under which defendants hold the land and
acquired the legal title, except in a single instance, made January 4th, 1868, before any action of the Secretary could be had
to withdraw the lands, and it was not until March 16th, 1876,
that any of the lands in controversy were selected by the company; an average of ten years after the rights of defendants
had vested. We are of opinion that the defendants had the
right to do this in regard to any but the odd sections within
the six-mile limit; that there was no contract between the

for years afterwards to make selections. It is unreasonable to

.Ward-Lousiazna--Tutriz.
1. A citizen of Louisiana in his lifetime had a.valid claim against the United
States for the recovery of which a remedy was given in the Southern
Claims Commission. After his decease his widow was duly appointed
tutrix to his minor children and heirs: .Held,That it was her duty to take
legal steps to recover the money from the United States, and that whethir
the action was brought in her own name, or in hers jointly with the children, she was equally bound to prosecute it with diligence.
2. On the principles set forth in Wy0man v. United States, 109 U. S. 654: Held,
That a payment of a claim against the United States, to a tutrix appointed
under the laws of Louisiana is a valid payment making her responsible
to the minors, if wronged, for the receipt of the money by herself or by
her authorized attorney.
8. A contract ith an attorney to prosecute a claim for a contingent fee is not
void; and under the circumstances of this case, the parties having agreed
upon fifty per cent. of the claim as a contingent fee, the court is not prepared to assume that the division is extortionate. Stantonv. Embrog,
93 U. S. 548, approved and followed.
