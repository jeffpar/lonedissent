to the admission of parties to testify in the courts of the United
States applies to the courts of the District of Columbia. The
act relating to that subject in reference to judicial proceedings
in the District covers the whole subject, and excludes the operation of any general law unless the latter is made specially applicable. The practice of admitting colored persons to testify
prevailed in the District courts from the organization of the
present Supreme Court of the District, and did not need the
aid of the general statute. The admission of parties to testify
in the courts of the District was provided for in a distinct and
separate statute relating to the District alone.
I concur in the judgment of the court notwithstanding the
evidence of the defendant.

GREENHOW

1. The judgment in a proceeding for a inandamus is subject.to review on the
same conditions as that in any other action.
2. A final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a State in
which a decision in the suit could be had, may -in the class of cases provided for in sect. 709, Rev Stat., be re-examined here upon writ of error,
although it was rendered upon an equal division of opinion among the
judges. It is immaterial whether that court, in rendering it, was exercising
original or appellate jurisdiction.
3. In the adjustment of her debt by the State of Virginia, her bonds, payable
to order or bearer, with coupons annexed to them payable to bearer, were
issued under the act of March 30, 1871, known as the "Funding Act," which
declares that the coupons "slall be receivable at and after maturity for
all taxes, debts, dues, and demands due the State," and that this shall be
expressed on their face. Where, therefore, a creditor took, as in that act
provided, such bonds for two-tlurds of the amount of the old bonds lie
surrendered, and a certificate for the balance, a contract was consummated between the State and the holder of the bonds and the holder of
the coupons, from which, without their consent, she could not be released.
4. A subsequent enactment requiring the tax on the bonds issued under that
act to be deducted from the coupons originally attached to them, when tendered in payment of taxes or other dues to the State, cannot be applied to
coupons separated from the bonds, and held by a different owner, without
impairing the contract. Such an owner is therefore entitled to a viandamus
to compel the proper officer to receive for their full amount the coupons
so tendered.

HARTMAN V. GREENHOW

ERROR to the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of
Virginia.
The case is fully stated in the opinion of'the court.

William L. .Royall for the plaintiff in error.
Hr James G Field, Attorney-General of Virginia, contra.
Mr. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error, who is the petitioner in the court
below, is a citizen and resident of the city of Richmond, State
of Virginia, and on the 5th of April, 1878, was indebted to
the State for taxes to the amount of twenty-six dollars and
fifty-three cents. On that day he tendered to the treasurer of
Richmond - who is by law charged with the duty of collecting
the taxes of the State in that city -certain interest coupons,
which were overdue, amounting to twenty-four dollars, cut
from bonds of the State, issued under the provisions of an act
of the General Assembly, passed March 30, 1871, commonly
known as the Funding Act, and two dollars and fifty-three
cents in lawful money of the United States, in payment of the
taxes, but the treasurer refused to receive the coupons in discharge of the taxes without first deducting therefrom the taxes
upon the bonds to which they were originally attached. The
petitioner holding the coupons was not at the time the owner
of such bonds. Upon this refusal he applied to the Supreme
Court of Appeals of Virginia for a writ of mandamus to the
treasurer to compel him to receive the coupons, with the
money mentioned, in full discharge of the petitioner's taxes,
without any deduction from the coupons for the taxes upon the
bonds.
The court issued a rule or an alternative writ upon the treasurer, to which he answered, that the General Assenibly of the
State had, for many years, exercised the right to tax all bonds,
choses in action, aild other evidences of debt, including bonds of
the State, that the taxes assessed upon the latter bonds were
according to their market value, the amount being fixed at fifty
cents on the one hundred dollars of such value, that the law
required the taxes to be collected when the interest on the
bonds was paid, and made it a high penal offence for any officer to receive coupons in payment of taxes without deducting

from their face value the tax levied upon the bonds from which
they were taken, and he referred to several acts of the legislature in support of this statement. He also answered, that at
the time the coupons were tendered to him he proposed to
deduct from them the amount of the taxes on the bonds
to which they were originally attached, and demanded of the
petitioner a like amount in money in addition to what was tendered, that he would not otherwise have been justified in
giving a receipt, in full for the taxes due, and that this additional amount the petitioner refused to pay The respondent,
therefore, denied that the petitioner was entitled to the writ,
and prayed that his petition be dismissed.
The application was fully argued before the Supreme Court
of Appeals by counsel for the petitioner, and by the attorneygeneral of the State for the treasurer. The judges of the court
were equally divided in opinion upon it, and, as is usual in such
cases, the application was denied, and judgment to that effect,
with costs, was entered. To review this judgment the case is
brought here on writ of error.
The principal question for determination, as thus seen, is the
validity of the statute of the State requiring the tax levied
upon its bonds to be deducted from the coupons for interest,
originally attached to them, when the coupons are presented
for payment, so far as it applies to coupons separated from the
bonds and held by different owners.
To fully understand this question, it will be necessary to
make a brief reference to the legislation of the State upon her
indebtedness. But before doing this there is a question of
jurisdiction to be considered. The judgment of the Supreme
Court of Appeals being entered upon an equal division of opinion among its judges, it is argued that there is no such final
adjudication of the State court as can be reviewed by this
court.
The Revised Statutes, which express the statute law of the
United States in force Dec. 1, 1873, provide, in sect. 709, - embodying substantially the provisions of the twenty-fifth section
of the Judiciary Act of 1789, - that a final judgment or decree,
in any suit, of the highest court of a State in which a decision
could be had, may be re-examined by the Supreme Court of

Oct. 1880.]

HARTMAN v. GREENHOW

the United States in three classes of cases. In all of them
there must be a final judgment or decree of the highest court
of the State, and the decision expressed by that judgment must
have involved a question under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, and have been adverse to some right,
privilege, or immunity claimed under them. Here the Supreme
Court of Appeals certifies that on the hearing of the case there
was drawn in question the validity of the statute of the State
authorizing the tax upon the bonds and requiring its deduction
from the coupons, on the ground of its repugnancy to the provision of the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting
any legislation by the States impairing the -obligation of contracts, and that the decision was in favor of the validity of the
State statute and against the right claimed by the petitioner
under the provision of the Constitution of the United States.
That this certificate correctly states the question involved will
more clearly appear from the legislation of the State, which we
shall presently consider. The judgment denying the writ of
mandamus was a final determination against the claim of the
petitioner to have the coupons held by him received for taxes
without a deduction from their face value of the amount of the
tax levied on the bonds. A mandamus in cases of this kind is
no longer regarded in this country as a mere prerogative writ.
It is nothing more than an ordinary proceeding or action in
which the performance of a specific duty, by which the rights
of the petitioner are affected, is sought to be enforced. Says
Mr. Chief Justice Taney "It updoubtedly came into use by
virtue of prerogative power ii the English crown, and was
subject to regulations and rules which have long since been
disused, but the right to the writ and the power to issue it
have ceased to depend upon any prerogative power, and it
is now regarded as an ordinary process in cases to which
it is applicable. It was so held by this court in the cases of
Kendall v The United- States, 1,2 Pet. 615, and Kendall v
Stokes et al., 3 How 100." Kentucky v Denntson, 24 How
66, 97 And such we understand to be the law of Virginia.
The judgment, therefore, in the case, stands like the judgment
in an ordinary action at law, subject to review under similar
conditions. It is not the less expressive of the decision of the

HARTMAN

v.

GREENHOW.

[Sup. Ct.

court upon the merits of the petitioner's claim in the case
because it is rendered upon an equal division of opinion among
the judges. The fact of division does not impair the conclusive force of the judgment, though it may prevent the decision
from being- authority in other cases upon the question involved.
The judgment is that of the entire court, and is as binding in
every respect as if rendered upon the concurrence of all the
judges. Lessteur v Price, 12 How 59, -Durant v Essex
County, 7 Wall. 107, s. a. 101 U. S. 5o5.
Nor does it matter that the judgment was rendered in an
original proceeding in the Suprenme Court of Appeals of Virginia, and not in a case pending before that court on appeal.
It is enough for our jurisdiction that the judgment is by the
highest tribunal of the State ii which a decision could be had
in the suit. When such a judgment is brought before us for
review, involving in its rendition a decision upon a Federal
question,we do not look beyond the action of that court. It is
enough that we have its final judgment in the case, whether it
be one of original jurisdiction or heard by it in the exercise of
its own appellate power over the inferior courts of the State.
We proceed, therefore, to consider the legislation of the State
upon her indebtedness. A brief sketch of it will perhaps enable us better than in any other way to exhibit the question
for our determination, and indicate the solution it should
receive.

It appears from the statutes to which we are referred - and
we know the fact as a matter of public history - that prior to
the late civil war Virginia had become largely indebted for
moneys borrowed to construct public works in the State. The
moneys were obtained upon her bonds, which were issued to an
amount exceeding $30,000,000. Being the obligations of a State
of large wealth, which never allowed its fidelity to its promises
to be questioned anywhere, the bonds found a ready sale in the
markets of the country Until the civil war, the interest on
them was regularly and promptly paid. Afterwards the payments ceased, and until 1871, with the exception of a few
small sums remitted in coin during the war to London for foreign bondholders, or paid in Virginia in Confederate money,
and a small amount paid in 1866 and 1867, no part of the in-

HARTMAN V. GREENHOW

terest or principal was paid. During the war a portion of her
territory was separated from her, and by its people a new State,
named West Virginia, was formed, and by the Congress of the
United States was admitted into the Union. Nearly.one-third
of her territory and people were thus taken from her jurisdiction.
But as the whole State had created the indebtedness for which
the bonds were issued, and participated m the benefits obtained
by the moneys raised, it was but just that a portion of the indebtedness should be assumed by that part which was taken
from her and made a new State. Writers on public law speak
of the principle as well established, that where a State is
divided into two or more States, in the adjustment of liabilities
between each other, the debts of the parent State should be
ratably apportioned among them. On this subject Kent says
"If a State should be divided in respect to territory, its rights
and obligations are not impaired, and if they have not been
apportioned by special agreement, their rights are to be enjoyed and their obligations fulfilled by all the parts in common."
1 Com. 26. And Halleck, speaking of a State divided into
two or more distinct and independent sovereignties, says "In
that case, the obligations which have accrued to the whole
before the division are, unless they have been the subject of a
special agreement, ratably binding upon the different parts.
This principle is established by the concurrent opinions of
text-writers, the decisions of courts, and the practice of nations." International Law, c. 3, sect. 27
In conformity with the doctrine thus stated by Halleck, both
States - Virginia and West Virginia - have recognized in
their Constitutions their respective liability for an equitable
proportion of the old debt of the State, and have provided that
measures should be taken for its settlement. The Constitution
of Virginia of 1870 declared that the General Assembly should
"provide by law for adjusting with the State of West Virginia
the proportion of the public debt of Virginia proper to be
borne by the States of Virginia and West Virginia," and should
"provide that such sums as shall be received from West Virgmia shall be applied to the payment of the public debt of the
State." Art. 10,. sect. 19.
The Constitution of West Virginia, which went into effect

HARTMAN

v.

GREENHOW

[SUP. Ct.

in 1863, declared that "an equitable proportion of the public
debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia, prior to the first day
of January, 1861," should "be assumed" by the State, and that
the legislature should "ascertain the same as soon as practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund
sufficient to pay the accruing interest and redeem the principal
within thirty-four years." Art. 8, sect. 8.
But notwithstanding these constitutional requirements and
various efforts made to adjust the liabilities of West Virginia,
nothing was accomplished up to March 30, 1871, and it is
stated by counsel that nothing has been accomplished since.
As might have been expected, the position of Virginia was
not a pleasant one, being charged with the whole indebtedness
which accrued before the formation out of her territory of a
new State, and entitled to, without being able to obtain, a contribution from the new State of a part of it, corresponding
proportionately to her extent and population. She, therefore,
undertook to effect a separate adjustment with her creditors,
and for that purpose, on the 30th of March, 1871, passed an
act known as the "Funding Act" of the State. It is entitled
"An Act to provide for the funding and payment of the public
debt." Its preamble recited that in the ordinance authorizing
the organization of the State of West Virginia it was provided
that she should take upon herself a just proportion of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia, prior to Jan. 1,
1861, and that this provision bad not been fulfilled, although
repeated and earnest efforts in that behalf had been made by
Virginia, and then declared that, " to enable- the State of
West Virginia to settle her proportion of said debt with the
holders thereof," and to prevent any complications or difficulties which might be interposed to any other manner of settlement, and "for the purpose of promptly restoring the credit of
Virginia, by providing for the certain and prompt payment of
the interest on her proportion of said debt, as the same shall
become due," the legislature enacted that the owners of the
bonds, stocks, or interest certificates of the State (with a few
exceptions) might fund two-thirds of the same and two-thirds
of the interest due or to become due thereon up to July 1,
1871, in six per cent coupon or registered bonds of the State,

Oct. 1880.]

HARTMAN v. GREENHOW.

to run thirty-four years,- the bonds to be made payable to
order or bearer, and the coupons to bearer. The act declared
that the coupons should be payable semi-annually, and "be
receivable.at and after maturity for all taxes, debts, dues, and
demands due the State," and that this should be so expressed
on their face. For the remaining one-third of the amount of
the bonds thus funded the act provided that certificates should
be issued to the creditors, setting forth the amount of the
bonds not funded, with the interest thereon, and that their
payment would be provided for in accordance with such settlement as might be subsequently had between the two States,
and that Virginia would hold the bonds surrendered, so far as
they were not funded, in trust for the holder or his assignees.
The bonds of the State, with the accumulated interest, then
amounted to over forty millions of dollars.
Under this act a large number of the creditors of the State,
holding bonds amounting, including interest thereon, to about
thirty millions of dollars, surrendered them and took new bonds
with interest coupons annexed for two-thirds of their amount
and certificates for the balance. A contract was thus consummated between the State and the holders of the new bonds,
and the lolders of the coupons, from the obligation of which
she could not, -without their consent, release herself by any
subsequent legislation. She thus bound herself, not only to
pay the bonds when they became due, but to receive the interest coupons from the bearer at and after their maturity, to
their full amount, for any taxes or dues by him to the State.
This receivability of the coupons for such taxes and dues was
written on their face, and accompanied them into whatever
hands they passed. It constituted their chief value, and was
the main consideration offered to the holders of the old bonds
to surrender them and accept new bonds for two-thirds of their
amount.
In Woodruff v. Traynall, reported in 10th Howard, a provision in an act of Arkansas, similar to this one, that the bills
and notes of the Bank of the State of Arkansas, the capital of
which belonged to the State. should "be received in all payments of debts due to the State of Arkansas," was held to be a
contract with the holders of such notes which was binding on

HARTMAN v. GREENHOW

[Sup. 0t.

the State, and that the subsequent repeal of the provision did
not affect the notes previously issued. "The notes," said the
court, " are made payable to bearer, consequently every bona
fide holder has a right, under the twenty-eighth section " (the
one making the notes receivable for dues to the State), "to
pay the State any debt he may owe it in the paper of the
bank. It is a continuing guaranty by the State that the notes
shall be so received. Such a contract would be binding on an
individual, and is not the less so on the State." "And that
the legislature could not withdraw this obligation from the
notes in circulation at the time the guaranty was repealed, is a
position which can require no argument." In .Furman v. Ntichol,
reported in the 8th Wallace, a similar provision in an act of
Tennessee, declaring that certain notes of the bank of that
State should be " receivable" at the treasury of the State and
by tax-collectors and other public officers, " in all payments
for taxes and other -moneys due the State," was held by this
court unanimously to constitute a valid contract between the
State and every person receiving a note of the bank. An attempt was made in the case to restrain the operation of the
guaranty contained in the provision to the person who received
the note in the course of his dealing with the bank, but the
court said "The guaranty is in no sense a personal one. It
attaches to the note, - is part of it, as much so as if written on
the back of it, goes ,with the note everywhere, and invites
every one who has taxes to pay to take it."
Yet notwithstanding the language of the act of March 30.
1871, providing that the interest coupons of the new bonds
should " be receivable at and after maturity for all taxes, debts,
dues, and demands due the State," and this was so expressed
upon their face, the legislature of Virginia, less than one year
afterwards (on the 7th of March, 1872), passed an act declaring that thereafter it should "not be lawful for the officers
charged with the collection of taxes or other demands of the
State" then due or which should thereafter become due "to
receive in payment thereof anything else than gold or silver
coin, United States Treasury notes, or notes of the national
banks of the United States." This act, as seen on its face, is
in direct conflict with the pledge of the State of the previous

year, and with the decisions of this court to which we have
referred. Its validity, as might have been expected, was soon
attacked in the courts as impairing the obligation of the contract contained in the Funding Act, and came before the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State for consideration in Anton?
v W 'ght, at its November Term of 1872. The subject was
there most elaborately and learnedly treated. The cases above
were cited by the court, and the provision of the Funding Act
was shown, by reasoning perfectly conclusive, to be a contract
founded upon valuable considerations and binding upon the
State. It was earnestly pressed upon the court that it was
not within the legitimate power of the legislature to make such
a contract, that it would tend to embarrass the action of subsequent legislatures by depriving them of the proper control of
the annual revenue, and might, by absorbing the revenue, substantially annul the taxing power and put a stop to the wheels
of government. But the court said, among other answers to
this, that no rightful power of the State was surrendered by
the legislation, but simply a provision made for the payment
of the debts of the State, that the annual accruing interest on
the debt of the State was in all well-regulated governments
deemed an essential part of their annual expenses, and was
always annually. provided for. The act only made provision
for an annual appropriation of a portion of the revenue, derived
from taxation, to the payment of existing debts, and such
legislation could not be deemed a great stretch of power, when
the organic law of the State not only contemplated the punctual annual payment of the interest of her entire debt, but
imperatively required, on the creation of a debt, that a sinking
fund should be at once established, to be applied solely to its
extinction. The organic law thus not merely authorized, but
required the legislature which created the debt to bind all
future legislatures, by the establishment of a fund to be applied
solely to the extinction of the debt. And as to the objection
that such legislation might, and probably would, result in crippling the power and resources of the State in time of war or
other great calamity, the court said, that legislation cannot
well be adapted in advance to extraordinary and exceptional
cases, that such cases will occur at all times witr all nations,

HARTMAN v. GREENHOW

[Sup. Ct.

and must be provided for by the wisdom and prudence of the
government for the time being " At such a time, however,"
said the court, in words full of wisdom, " the honored name
and high credit secured to a State by unbrolen faith, even in
adversity, will, apart from all other considerations, be worth
more to her in dollars- incalculably more- than the comparatively insignificant amount of the interest on a portion of
the public debt enjoyed by breach of contract." The court
thus expressed a great truth, which all just men 'appreciate,
that there is no wealth or power equal to that which ultimately
comes to a State when in all her engagements she keeps her
faith unbroken.
These decisions of the Federal and State courts dispose substantially of the question presented in the case at bar. The
act of March, 1872, being held to be invalid, the coupons were
subsequently, and until March, 1873, received for all taxes due
the State to their full amount. On the 25th of that, month,
the legislature passed an act providing that from the interest
payable out of the treasury on bonds of the State, whether
funded or unfunded, there should be retained a tax equal in
amount to fifty cents on the one hundred dollars of their
market value, on the first day in April of each year, and made
it the duty of every officer of the Commonwealth, charged
with the collection of taxes, to deduct from the matured coupons which might be tendered to him in payment of taxes, or
other dues to the State, such tax as was then or might thereafter be imposed on the bonds. The act, in terms, applied to
all bonds of the State, whether held by her own citizens or
non-residents and citizens of other States or countries. In
1874, the legislature modified this provision so that the tax
on the bonds should not be retained from the interest paid on
them, when they were the property of non-residents of the
Commonwealth. But this exemption was omitted in the act
of 1876, providing for the assessment of taxes in the State, in
which the provision of the act of 1873 was inserted. It is the
validity of this provision requiring the tax levied on the bonds
to be deducted from the coupons held by other parties, when
tendered in payment of their taxes or other dues to the State,
which is presented for our determination.

Oct. 1880.]

HARTMAN V. GREENHOW

The power of the State to impose a tax upon her own obligations is a subject upon which there has been a difference of
opinion among jurists and statesmen. On the one hand, it has
been contended that such a tax is in conflict with and contrary
to the obligation assumed, that the obligation to pay a certain
sum is inconsistent with a right, at the same time, to retain a
portion of it in the shape of a tax, and that to impose such
a tax is, therefore, to violate a promise. of the government.
See Hamilton on the Public Credit, in his works, 3d vol.,
pp. 514-518.
On the other hand, it is urged that the borids of every State
are property in the hands of its creditors, and, as such, that
they should bear a due proportion of the public burdens. In
the case of Hurray v Charleston(96 U. S. 432) there are many
pertinent and just observations on this subject which it is not
material to repeat, for the question is not necessarily involved
in the disposition of the case before us. Whatever may be
the wise rule -looking at the necessity in a commercial country for its prosperity that its public credit should never be
impaired -as
to the taxability of the public securities, it Is
settled that any tax levied upon them cannot -be withheld from
the interest payable thereon. Such was the decision of this
court in Murray v Charleston. There the city had issued certificates of stock, whereby it promised to pay to the owners
thereof certain sums of money, with six per cent interest, payable quarterly Subsequently it imposed a tax of two per cent
on the value of all property within its limits for the purpose
of meeting the expenses of its government, and, treating its
stock as part of such property, directed that the tax assessed
upon it should be retained by the treasurer of the city from the
interest due thereon. To recover the amount thus retained,
which was one-third of the interest stipfilated, suit was brought.
The city defended its action on the ground that the tax on the
stock was not higher than the tax on all other property of its
citizens, and that all property in the city was subject to taxation, but the court answered that, by the legislation of the
city, its obligation to its creditors was impaired, and, however
great its power of taxation, it must be exercised, being a political agency of the State, in subordination to the inhibition of

HARTMAN

v. GREENHOW.

[Slip. Ct.

the Federal Constitution against legislation impairing the obligation of contracts. Until the interest was paid, no act of
the State or of its political subdivisions, exercising legislative
power by its authority, could work an exoneration from what
was promised to the creditor. This decision would be decisive
here, but the present case is still stronger for the creditor. The
Funding Act made the bonds issued under it payable to order or
bearer, and made the coupons payable to bearer. They were,
so far, distinct and independent contracts, that they could be
separated from each other and transferred to different hands.
In Clark v Iowa City we had occasion to speak of bonds of
municipal bodies and private corporations having similar coupons, and the language there used is applicable here. We
said that most of such bonds "are issued in order to raise
funds for works of large extent and cost, and their payment
is, therefore, made at distant periods, not unfrequently beyond
a quarter of a century Coupons for different instalments of
interest are usually attached to such bonds in the expectation
that they will be paid as they mature, however distant the
period fixed for the payment of the principal. These coupons,
when severed from the bonds, are negotiable and pass by delivery They then cease to be incidents of the bonds, and become
in fact independent claims, they do not lose their validity if

commercial paper, as has been held by this court in repeated
instances. 20 Wall. 588, 589.
Here, also, the coupons held by the petitioner were distinct
contracts imposing separate obligations upon the State. He
was not the owner of the bonds to which they had been originally attached. In his hands they were as free and discharged
from all liability on those bonds as though they had never been
connected with them. And surely it is not necessary to argue
that an act which requires the holder of one contract to pay
the taxes levied upon another contract held by a stranger
cannot be sustained. Such an act is not a legitimate exercise
of the taxing power it undertakes to impose upon one the
burden which should fall, if at all, upon another.

Oct. 1880.]

HARTIAN v. GREENHOW.

The Funding Act stipulated that the coupons should be receivable for all taxes and dues to the State, that is, for taxes
and aues owing by the holders of the coupons, and for their,full
amount, and upon this pledge the holders of the bonds of the
State surrendered them, and took new bonds for two-thirds of
their amount. The act of 1876 declares that the coupons shall
not be thus received for taxes and dues owing by the holders
of them for their full amount, but only for such portion as
may remain after a tax subsequently levied upon the bonds,
to which they were originally attached, is deducted, though
the bonds be held by other parties. If this act does not
impair the contract with the bondholder, - who was authorized to transfer to others the coupons with this quality of receivability for taxes annexed,- and also the contract with
the bearer of the coupon written on its face that it should
be received for all taxes to the State, it is difficult to see
in what way the contract with either would be impaired,
even though the tax on the bond should equal the whole
face of its coupons. If, against the express terms of the contract, the State can take a portion of the interest in the
shape of a tax on the bond, it may at its pleasure take the
whole.
We are clear that this act of Virginia of 1876 (sect. 117),
requiring the tax on her bonds, issued under the Funding Act
of March 30, 1871, to be deducted from the coupons originally attached to them when tendered in payment of taxes or
other dues to the State, cannot be applied to coupons separated
from the bonds, and held by different owners, without impairing the contract with such bondholders contained in the Funding Act, and the contract with the bearer of the coupons. It
follows that the petitioner was entitled to a writ of mandamus
to compel the treasurer of the city of Richmond to receive the
coupons, tendered to him in payment of taxes due the State,
for their full amount.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals denying
the writ must, therefore, be reversed, and the case remanded
for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and
it is
So ordered.

MR. JUSTICE MILLER dissenting. I dissent from the judgment of the court. In addition to the general proposition
which I have always maintained, that no legislature of a State
has authority to bargain away the State's right of taxation, I
am of opinion that in issuing the bonds and coupons which
are the subject of this controversy the legislature of Virginia,
neither m terms nor by any just inference, made any contract
that the bonds and coupons should not be subject to the same
