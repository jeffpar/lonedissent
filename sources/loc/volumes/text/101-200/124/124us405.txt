UNION INSURANOE OOMPANY v. SIMITH.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT

OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
Submitted January 6,1888. -Decided January 30, 1888.

A time policy of marine insurance on a steam tug to be employed on the
Lakes, insured her against tho perils of the Lakes, excepting perils
"consequent upon and arising from or caused by" "incompetency of
the master" "or want of ordinary care and skill in navigating said vessel, rottenness, inherent defects,"." and all other unseawortliness."
While towing vessels in Lake Huron, in July, her shaft was broken,
causing a leak at her stern. The leak was so far stopped that by moderate pumping she was kept free from water. She was taken in tow and
carried by Port Hurdn and Detroit and into Lake Erie on a destination to
Cleveland, where she belonged and her owner lived. She sprang a leak
in Lake Erie, and sank, and was abandoned to the insurer. On the trial
of a suit on the polhiy, it iyas claimed by the defendant that the accident
made the vessel unseaworthy, and the failure to repair her at Port
Huron or Detroit avoided thp policy. The court charged the jury that if
an ordinarily prudent mastei would have deemed it necessary to repair
her before proceeding, and if her logs wag occasioned by the omission to
do so, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; but If, from the character of the injury an! 'the leak, a master of competent judgment might

Opinion of the Court.
reasonably have supposed, in the exercise of ordinary care, that she was
seaworthy to be towed to Cleveland, andi therefore omitteji to repair her,
such omission was no bar to a recovery. Held, that there was no error
-inthe charge.
Expert testimony as to whether, under the circumstances, it was the exercise of good seamanship and prudence to attempt to have the vessel
towed to Cleveland, was competent.
The question of the competency of the particular witnesses to testify as
experts, considered,
The weight of the evidence of each witness was a question for the jury,
in view of the testimony of each as to his experience.
It was not improper to refuse to allow the defendant to ask a witness what
talk he had with the master of the tug, after she was taken in tow, in
regard to the leak, or whiat should be done, it not being stated what it
was proposed to prove, and it not appearing that the statement of the
master ought to be regarded as part of the res gestae.
A motion by the defendant, at the close of the plaintifif's testimony, to take
the case from the jury, was properly refused, because it was a motion
for a peremptory nonsuit, against the will of the plaintiff; and it was
waived by the introduction by the defendant of testimony in the further
progress of the case.
A general exception to a refusal to charge a series of propositions, as a
whole, is bad, if any one of the series is objectionable.
The defendant having set up, in its answer, that the loss was otasioned
by want of ordinary care in managing the tug at the time she 9prang
a leak in Lake Erie, and having attempted to prove such defence, it was
not error to charge the jury that such want of ordinary care must be
shown by a fair preponderance of proof on the part of the defendant.

trict of Ohio, to recover the sum of $7000, with interest, for
the loss of a vessel insured by a policy of marine insurance
issued by the defendant. The policy was dated May 6, 1884,
and insured the steam-tug N. P. Sprague, from May 6, 1884, to
December 10, 1881, in the sum of $7000, the vessel "to be
employed exclusively in the freighting and passenger business,
and to navigate only the wators, bays, harbors, rivers, canals,
and other tributaries of lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, St.
Clair, Erie, and Ontario, and river St. Lawrence to Quebec,'
usually navigated by vessels of her class," the-vessel being
valued in the policy at $9334.. The policy contained these
provisions: "Touching the adventures and perils, which the
said insurance company is content to bear and take upon itself
by this policy, they are of the lakes, rivers, canals, -fires, jettisons, that shall come to the damage of the said vessel or any
part thereof, excepting all perils, losses, misfortunes, or expenses consequent upon and arising from or caused by the
following or other legally excluded causes, viz.: Damage that
may be done by the vessel hereby insured to any other vessel
or property; incompetency of the master or insufficiency of
the crew or want of ordinary care and skill in navigating said
vessel, and in loading, stowing, and securing the cargo of said
vessel; rottenness, inherent defects, overloading, and all other
unseaworthiness." "Boiler clause. Unless caused by stranding, collision, or the vessel being bn fire, the insured warrants
this policy to be free from any claim for loss or damage to
boilers, steam-pipes, or machinery caused by the bursting,
explosion, collapsing, or breaking of the same, and to be free
from any and every general average and salvage expense in
consequence thereof, excepting always the expenses of getting
the vessel from an exposed position to the nearest place of
safety, when further expenses of above nature are not to be a,
claim on the insurer."
The petition by which the suit was commenced in the state
court set forth that the plaintiff was the owner of the tug;
that on the 18th of July, i884, the vessel, in her regular
course of business, left Port L'Anse, bound to Cleveland; that
she was then stout, stanch, and strong, and in all respects

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

seaworthy for the voyag she was about to undertake; that,
,while on that voyage, and on the 23d of July, 1881, and with-,
out fault or negligence on the part of the plaintiff or those in
charge and management of her, but solely by reason of the
perils of navigation so insured against by the defendant, she
sprung a leak; that, although the plaintiff and his agents, and
the officers in charge of the vessel, used all reasonable endeav"6rsto prevent said vessel filling, with water, they were unable
so to do; that, within a short time after the discovery of the
leak, the vessel filled with water and sank, and became a total
loss; that the plaintiff promptly caused proof of loss to be
made to the defendant, as required by the policy, and also, in
compliance with its terms, caused to be made to the defendant
an assignment and transfer of all interest which he had in the
vessel, and made a claim upon the defendant for $7000, as for
a total loss; and that the defendant accepted the abandonment and transfer.
The answer admitted the character and general occupation
of the tug, and the issuing Qf the policy to the plaintiff, and
denied every allegation in the. petition not expressly admitted
in the answer to be true. The second and third defences contained in the answer were as follows:
"2d defence. And, by way of further answer, and for, a
second defence, defendant says, that said tug, while on Lake
Huron, was rendered helpless and unseaworthy and in great
-danger of springing a leak and sinking by the breaking of her
shaft, a part of her machinery, which breaking was not.caused
by stranding, collision, or the vessel being on fire, and was
compelled to and did abandon the vessel which she had in tow;
and, while in such helpless, unseaworthy, and perilous condition, said tug was picked up and towed to Port Huron, a place
of safety and a port of repair, where every facility and convenient meanr of repairing said tug were at hand; yet defendant avers that said tug wa not there repaired, but, without the
knowledge or consent of defendant, said tug, in the same helpless and unseaworthy and dangerous condition before described,
was towed out of and past said port of Port Huron, and was
afterwards towed in the same condition into and through and

. sMITH.

Opinion of the Court.

past the port of Detroit, at which last named place every facility and all conveniences existed for repairing said tug, and
which also was a place of entire safety; and, without any
notice to defendant, and without its knowledge and consent,
the said tug being then and at all times hereinbefore mentioned
in the possession and control of plaintiff and his agents, said
tug was, in such helpless and unseaworthy and dangerous condition, towed out upon Lake Erie, not in any manner navigating as a tug or by or with the aid of her own machinery and
appliances, and, soon after reaching Lake Erie, without any
stress of weather, the said tug sprung a leak and was sunk.
"3d defence. And, for a furtther and third defence, the defendant says, that, while said tug N. P.. Sprague was on Lake
Huron, having in tow several vessels, part of her machinery, to,
wit her shaft, broke, the said breaking not being caused by
stranding, collision, or the vessel being on fire, whereby said
tug was completely disabled, and was compelled to and did
give up her said tow, and was rendered unseaworthy and helpless, and was in great and constant peril of springing a leak
and sinking by the working of her propeller wheel and broken
shaft attached thereto; and, in that condition, she was picked
up, and, by direction of her master, towed to 'Port Huron,
Mfichigan, which was a place of safety and at which every
facility and convenient means for repairing said tug in all
respects were at hand, but the plaintiff negligently failed and
neglected to repair, or cause to be repaired, said tug, and
negligently, and without the knowledge or consent of the
defendant, caused her to be towed out of and away from said
port of safety and repair, in the unseaworthy and dangerous
condition above desciribed; and afterwards, in the same condition, said tug was towed into and through and past the port
of Detroit, a place of safety, where every means and facility
for repairing said tug was at hand and co.nvenient; yet the
plaintiff, not regarding his duty in that behalf, negligently
failed to repair, or cause to be repaired, the said tug, and
permitted her, in the unseaworthy, helpless, disabled, and dangerons condition before described, to be towed out of Detroit
River and out upon Lake Erie; that, soon after reaching the

Opinion of the CMut.

lake, and meeting with a slight and ordinary swell, the said
tug, by reason of her said broken ma-chinery, and by reason of
her said unseaworthiness and helpless and dangerous condition,
.sprung a serious leak and soon after was sunk."
The-plaintiff demurred to the 'econd defence, as not stating
facts sufficient in law to constitute a. defence to the cause of
action alleged in the petition, and replied to the third defence
.as follows:
"This plaintiff admits, that, while the tug N. P. Sprague
was on Lake-Huron, having in tow several vessels, a part of
her machinery, to wit her shaft, broke, whereby said tug was
-compelled to and did give up her said tow, and was rendered
helpless, and was in this condition, -by the direction of her
master, towed to Port Huron, Michigan, which was a place of
safety; that said master caused her to be towed away from
Port Huron to and past Detroit, which was also a place of
safety; and that, soon after reaching Lake Erie, on her way to
Cleveland, she sprung a leak and soon after sunk, but this
plaintiff denies all and singular the allegations in said third
-defence contained, except those hereinabove admitted."
The court sustained the demurrer to the second defence, and
the issues of fact joined were tried by a jury, which returned a
verdict for the plaintiff for $7569.33. A motion for a new
trial was overruled, and a judgment was entered in favor of
the plaintiff, for the $7569.33, and interest, and costs, on the
25th of March, 1886, the verdict having been rendered on the
24th of February, 1886. The defendant has brought a writ oferror -to review this judgment.
There is a bill of exceptions, filed on the 25th of March,
1886, which sets forth, that, at the trial of the case, the plaintiff, to maintain the issue on his part, introduced and offered
in evidence certain testimony, which is set forth. At the close
of such testimony; it is stated that counsel "moved the court
to take the case from the jury on the ground of absence of
proof of a loss of plaintiff's vessel within th. policy, and
because there is not sufficient testimony to justify a recovery;"
that "the motion was overruled by the court, to which ruling.
the defendant duly excepted;" and that "the foregoing was

UNION INS. CO. v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

all the testimony offered by the plaintiff to maintain the issues
on his part, in chief." It is then stated that the defendant, to
maintain the issues on its part, offered in evidence certain
testimony, which is set forth.. It is then stated that "the
foregoing was all the testimony offered upon either side, and
upon both sides, in the trial of said case;" that, "the testimony being all in, defendant moved the court here to take
the case from the jury and direct a verdict for the defendant ;"
that the motion was overruled by the court; and that the
defendant excepted to such ruling.
The charge of the court to the jury is then set forth at
length. The charge, after a statement of the pleadings, was
as follows:
"These pleadings form the issue that you are required to
determine, in the light of the proof that you have heard on
this trial. To entitle the plaintiff to recover he must show.
that he has complied with the terms of the policy; that he
has made the necessary preliminary proofs; that the vessel
wds lost .by reason of th6 perils against which it was insured;
and it must- appear from the whole proof, that the loss was
not occasioned by the want of ordinary care of the master in
charge of the vessel, or on account of being unseaworthy, as
hereinafter stated, and not within the exceptions contained in
the policy, against which the defendant did not insure the
plaintiff.

.

•"The perils of -th6 lake, river, &c., which the defendant
took upon itself, by the terms of the policy, were such as
.should come to the damage of the vessel or any part thereof,
excepting the incompetency 6f the master or insufficiency of
the crew, or want of ordinary care and sidll in the navigation
of the vessel, rottenness, and defects -of the vessel, and all
other un.seaworthiness.
"The perils bf the lake described and referred to by this
policy of insurance denote the natural accidents peculiar to
that element, which do not happen by the intervention of
man nor are to be prevented by human prudence.
"[I direct you that the breaking of the shaft, without any
fault of the master or owners, was one of the perils covered

Opinion of the Court.

by the insurance, and, if the vessel had been lost by reason
thereof, the defendant would have been liable under the
policy.] So, if such breaking of the shaft in Lake Huron was.
the cause of the Sprague sinking afterwards in Lake Erie,.
without the master being guilty of a want of ordinary care in
the navigation of the vessel, such loss was covered by the.
policy of insurance. [If the vessel was lost in Lake Erie from
the sudden springing of a leak, occasioned from some unknown
cause, and without the fault of the master or the owners, in
the exercise of ordinary care in its navigation, and the vessel
at the time it started being seaworthy, such loss would be
covered by the insurance under the policy. The plaintiff,
however, in such case must sh6w that the master in control of
the vessel exercised ordinary care in its management at the;
time that the loss occurred.]
"Ordinary care is such as a reasonably prudent man would
exercise, and must have reference to the circumstances under
which the care is required to be exercised. What would be
ordinary care under some circumstances may not be at other
times and under other circumstances.
"[It was generally the duty of the plaintiff to keep the
Sprague in a seaworthy condition for the safe navigation of
the waters in which she might be run under the policy, and,.
when that seaworthiness, under the policy of insurance, is
made and attaches, it is presumed to exist and continue, and
the burden .of the proof of unseaworthiness would then be
upon the defendant.]
"[There is no claim in the defence in this case that the
Sprague was not seaworthy when she started from the port of
'Anse, with her tows, for the port of Cleveland,] but it is.
claimed that in Lake Huron her shaft was broken, causing a
dangerous leak in the vessel, so that she was disabled and had
herself to be taken in tow with the other vessels, and that shethen became and was unseaworthy, -and that it was the duty
of -the plaintiff or the master to have repaired her, so as to.
make her seaworthy, at eitherPort Huron or the ,first port at
whidh it could be done, or at the port of Detroit, before attempting to cross Lake Erie to .Oleveland, and which, it is.

claimed, -was not done, by reason 'of which the vbssel was lost,
and, therefore, the defendant not liable on this policy.
"fThe Spiague having been temporarily repaired by calking.
the leakage occasioned by the breaking of -hershaft, and taken
in tow by the Wilcox, and in safety having reached Detroit,
the question presents itself ' as to the duty of the master- or
plaintiff to have the proper repairs made there, before starting
on Lake Erie for her home port on Lake Erie, and, failing to
do so, how does it affect the plaintiff's right to recover on this
policy?
"[On this point. I direct you, that if, when the Sprague
arrived at Detroit, the breaking of the shaft and the consequent leakage therefrom was such that an ordinarily prudent
and discreet master, of competent skill and judgment,_would
have deemed it necessary to repair the vessel, so as to stop theleak, before proceeding on the voyage to Cleveland, and you
find that the sinking of the vessel and its loss was occasioned
by his omission to do so, and would not otherwise have hap-.
pened, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this suit.]
"[But if you find, from the character of the injury and the
leak, that a master of competent skill and judgment might reasonably have supposed, in the exercise of ordinary care for the*
safety of the vessel, that she was seaworthy for the voyage in
-which she was then engaged, in the manner that she was to
make the trip to Cleveland in tow of the Wilcox, notWithstanding the leakage occasioned by.such breaking of the shaft,,
and on that account omitted to make such repair at Detroit,
then such omission to make such repair at Detroit is no bar to
a recovery in this suit.]
"[On the question of the competency of the master, I direct
you, that th6 competency ofthe master is not to be determined.
by the want of a license to act as master of a -vessel, or by the
fact that the mnaster had a license under the provisions of the
statute, but it is to be determined, by the skill, experience,'
and ability of the master in the line of his duties as mster, as
shown in the proof.]
"[The seaworthiness of a vessel must have reference to the
character of the service to be perfqrmed hd the nature and

Opinion of the Court.

character of the voyage to be made in this case. Was the
Sprague seaworthy, at the time she left Detroit, to be towed
from Detroit to Cleveland, not to propel herself in the navigation of the Lakes in the usual business of a tug, but seaworthy
so as to be in a condition to be towed, as the voyage was
undertaken to be made, in tow of the tug Wilcox?]
"In view of these general principles of law, it will be important for you to carefully examine all of the evidence in reference to the injury and' its extent, and the means used temporarily to stop the leakage and keep the vessel clear of water during the period of her trip from the place of injury to Detroit,
and how it appeared to the master at Detroit, and what was
its condition when the vessel did arrive at Detroit.
"And, as -bearing upon the exercise of every ordinary care
by the master, in reference to the continuing of the voyage
-without repairs, you will carefully consider the opinions of the
experts in navigation, who have testified to you in relation to
the character of the vessel and the injury, and the necessity,
for the safety of the vessel, of repairing, and the danger or
absence of danger in continuing the voyage, under all the circumstances of the situation. The .value of this expert testimony depends very largely upon the skill, the information or
knowledge, and the experience, 'of the party who undertakes
to give his opinion on any given subject. We are always required to consider the testimony of experts -in different and
various branches of business, and more particularly that connected with navigation upon the lakes and rivers in this country. Then the opinions of these experts depend very largely
upon the truth of the hypothetical case that counsel on the
one side and on the other have seen proper to put to the witnesses during their examination, and you, no doubt, have
noticed, in the testimony of these experts, that the same expert
witness, in response to the hypothetical case on the one side,
will answer affirmatively, and to the hypothetical case put by
the other side he will answer affirmatively also.
"The value of tbat sort of opinion depends very largely upon
the question of .how the facts in this case have been established
in the proof before you, and, in giving weight to the testimony

UNION INS. CO. v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

of experts, you will be careful to ascertain what the evidence
establishes as to the truth -of the one or the other of thesedifferent hypothetical cases put by counsel to the witnesses on
the examinations.
"Then it is claimed that in Lake Erie, at the time of the.
sudden increase of the leakage of the vessel, the master did
not exercise ordinary care for the safety of the vessel, in not.
taking her to a safe port, or safe place on the beach, so as toprevent the loss of the vessel. I direct you that it was the.
duty of the master at the time to exercise -ordinary care, underall the circumstances, to secure the safety of the vessel, and toprevent the loss thereof, or any greater loss than could be prevented by the exercise of such ordinary care by the master.
"You will then carefully consider the evidence, and all thecircumstances surrounding the transaction, with the evidence.
of the experts who have given testimony in the case, and find
whether the master was guilty of" the want of ordinary care.
If you find he did not exercise that care and diligence, and the
vessel *as lost for the want of such care, then the plaintiff is.
not entitled to recover in this action.
"[The burden, however, to show the want of ordinary careat the time of the loss in Lake Erie, must be shown by a fairpreponderance of the proof on behalf of the defendant, for thereason that the Acefendant sets it up in its special defence, in:
the form of a special answer, and in that respect takes upon
itself the establishment of the affirmative of that proposition.],
"Under these general directions - and these are about all
the -questions of law involved in the case - you are to make
your finding. [So far as the matter of preliminary proof is.
concerned, required to be made out b'y the plaintiff, I do not
understand that the defendant makes any great contest in
reference to whether that. was made or not, but it has denied
it in the form of an answer, aid you will look into the testimony and see whether that satisfactorily shows the proof of
loss was made to this company before this action was brought,
although the paper was not present. 6h the trial before you.]
Then carefully examine all the evidence, and if you find that.

favor of the defebdant,
him to recover, your verdict will be in.
but if you find, in the application -of these general principles,
under the evid6nce, before you, that the plaintiff is entitled to
recover in this action, the measure of. that recovery is the
amount of the policy of insurance, the vessel being a total loss,
and having been estimated in the policy at $9300. The measure of recovery w6uld be the $7000, and the plaintiff would
be entitled to recover interest from the time the money became
layable by the terms of the policy-ixty, days after the
presentation pf the preliminary proof- until the first day of
the present term.
"Now take the case, geutlemen, and make such a finding as
will satisfy you of having correctly carried out these general
princiiles and correctly weighed, considered, and decided the
questions of,fact before you."
The bill, of exceptions then states that the defendant took
the following exceptions to the charge of the court:
" 1. To that portion of the charge which relates to the
breaking of the shaft on Lake Huron, witHout any fault of"
the master's, being a peril of the sea,' and if the loss occurred
.fromthat -the defendant would be liable.
"2. To that portion of the charge which says the springing
of a tdak on Lake Erie from some unknown cause would be a
peril of the sea for which the defendant would be liable.
"3. To that portion of the charge which says the burden
of the proof of unseaworthiness is on the defendant, and also'
to the statement of the charge that there is no claim on the
part of the defendant that she Was iot seaworthy when she
left L'Anse.
1 "4.To that portion of the charge in reference to the duty
of the plaintiff or master to repair at Detroit, and to that part
in
nwhich the court says, that if an ordinarily prudent and
skilful master would have stopped at Detroit and made repairs,
than it was plaintiff's duty to so~stop in this case.
"5.".To that portion of the charge, in the same connection,
in which the court directs the jury, that if they find, from the
character of the leak, &c., in the exercise of ordinary care, the
master would-not stop, then the defendant, would be liable.

UNION INS. CO. v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

"6. To that portion of the charge in reference to the license
of the master.
"'7. To that part of the charge which says that seaworthiness must have reference to the nature of the voyage,
"8. To that portion of the charge which says that the
burden of proof is on the defendant to show the want of ordinary care at the time of the loss, in trying to prevent the loss,
because the defendant sets that up in a special plea.
"9. To that portion of the charge in reference to the preliminary proofs having been made in this action.
"10. Also to therefusal of the court to charge the requests
presented by the defendant in this case, numbered 1 to 15.
"11. Also to the entire charge as given."
It is then stated in the bill of exceptions, that the defendant requested the cqurt to give to the jury the following
instructions:
"1. Under all the testimony in this case your verdict should
be for the defendant.
"2. The burden of proving a loss of this kind is on the
plaintiff. There is no presumption that the loss was caused
by a peril insured against by the defendant.
"3. It was the duty of the master, at Detroit, before leaving or passing for Cleveland with a crippled tug, to ascertain
at the signal station what would probably be the weather in
the direction of Cleveland during the time necessary to reach
that point, if such information could have been obtained at
Detroit, and his failure to do so would be, under such circumstaneds, a want of ordinary care and skill.
"4. It was the duty of the plaintiff to keep the tug Sprague
in a seaworthy condition for the safe performance of this trip
- that is, her hull must have been so tight, stanch, and
strong as to be competent to resist all ordinary action of the
winds and waves -and, if he failed to put her in such condition at-Detroit, and she was lost in consequence of her failure
to be in such condition on Lake Erie after passing Detroit,
and you find that sufficient repairs could have been made at
Detroit, your verdict must be for defendant.
"5. Under the policy in this case, the company does not

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

agree to indemnify the plaintiff against all damages that
might happen to her in*the course of navigation of a vessel, or
all the misfortunes that may befall her while upon the Lakes,
and theraE re excepted from the provisions of this policy, and
from the liability of the defendant, certain risks which the
defendant does not take upon itself to bear. The purport of
these exceptions, so far as this case is concerned, is, that the
company does not undertake to insure any loss to this vessel
which may be occasioned by the incompetency of the master,
the insufficiency of the crew, or want of ordinary care and skill
in navigating, or any unseaworthiness of any description.
"6. In order to find for plaintiff, you must find that the
loss of this tug was by a peril of the sea, that is, by some
natural perils and operation of the elements which occurred
without the intervention of human agency, .and which the.
prudence of man could not foresee nor his strength resist.
Imprudence or want of skill in a master may have been.
unforeseen, but it is not a fortuitous event, The isurer
undertakes only to indemnify against extraordinary perils -of
the sea, and not against those ordinary ones to which 'eyry
ship must inevitably be exposed.
"'7. It is admitted by the pleadings in this case, that, after
the breaking of the shaft on Lake Huron, the tug wgs towed
to Port Huron, and also to Detroit, both ports.of gai4ty.. This
being so, if you find that the loss was occasioned by ?eaon of
unseaworthiness after leaving Detroit, the-defendant is entitled
to your verdict.
"8. Under the circumstances of this case, if you find that
the vessel was not seaworthy when: she sprung a leak on Lake
Erie, your verdict must be for the defendant, without reference necessarily to any question of whether the master used
good or bad judgment in leaving or passing Detroit, because the
plaintiff and defendant agreed in the policy that perils and'
losses growing out of unseaworthiness were not insured against..
"9. If you find that the loss was incurred or contributed to
by the incompetency of the master, or want of ordinary care
and skill in navigation, your verdict must be for defendant.
"10. If you find that, after the danger was discovered on

UNION INS. CO. v. SMITH.
Opinion of the Court.

Lake Erie, the master did not do what a competent master
of ordinary prudence would do, and that, by the use of ordinary skill and care, under such circumstances, by a competent
master, the tug could have been got to a place of safety and
her loss prevented, your verdict should be for the defendant.
"11. The fact that this tug began leaking so rapidly on
Lake Erie, in moderate weather, so soon after leaving Detroit,
raises a presumption that, either from the effects of the accidant on Lake Huron, or in some other respect, she was unseaworthy for the undertaking to go to Cleveland when she left
Detroit, which it devolves upon the plaintiff to explain and
overcome.
"12. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff in this case, to
show, by a fair preponderance of the testimony, that the sinking and loss of this tug could not have been guarded against
or prevented .by the. ordinary exertion of human skill and
pruden&e.
"13. In this case the words ' ordinary skill' and ' ordinary
care' have a relative ifneaning. What would be ordinary care
in relation to a strong, stanch, sound vessel, might fall far
short of ordinary care and skill in relation to a wounded
vessel. What might be ordinary care and skill if the tug was
seaworthy and navigating as a tug, might fall far short of
ordinary care when the tug is broken down and a severe and
dangerous leak has been temporarily stopped. You must consider the circumstances of the case, the condition of the vessel,
whether she could meet and withstand the ordinary wear and
tear and strain of the elements, or required fine weather and
smooth water; what means there. existed of ascertaining the
probable weather during the time he would be occupied in
crossing Lake Erie; what precaution he took or failed to take
.in this respect; as well as all other circumstances.
"14. If this tug, after her accident on Lake Huron, was
unseaworthy, and in consequence was lost on Lake Erie, her
loss is to be attributed to the unseaw orthiness and not to the
accident, provided the master had opportunity. to repair the
damage done on Lake Huron, and in that case your verdict
must be for the defendant.

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

"Which requests to charge were refused by the court,
except so far as covered by the charge already given, to which
refusal to charge the defendant excepted.
"And the jury, after being charged, retired, and afterwards
returned a verdict for said plaintiff against said defendant for
the sum of seven thousand dollars ;- and, the defendant having
filed its motion for new trial for the reasons and. causes set out
in said motion, and the said Circuit Court having overruled
said motion andentered judgment on said verdict, the said
defendant excepted to the said ruling of said court overruling
said motion for new trial, and-to said judgment, and prayed
the court here to sign and seal this its bill of exceptions, and
order the same to be made a part of the record in this case;
all which is done and ordered as said defendant has prayed
for." Then follow the signature and seal of the judge.
The defendant alleges that the Circuit Court erred in overruling objections taken by it to testimony offered by the plaintiff; and in rejecting testimony offered by the defendar; and
in, overruling the motion made by the defendant to take the
case from the jury at the close of the plaintiff's testimony;
and in overruling the motion made by the defendant, at the
close of its testimony, to take the case from the jury and to
direct a verdict for the defendant; and in overruling objections taken by the defendant to the charge to the jury; and
in overruling the defendant's requests to instruct the jury.
Assuming that the bill of exceptions. sufficiently indicates
that the exceptions taken by the defendant to the admissions
and exclusions of evidence were taken during the course of the
trial, we proceed to considerxthe objections urged to the admissions of evidence.
John Bowen, the master of the tug, who was on board of
her at the time she was lost, was asked this question:
"Q. What do you say as to its being good seamanship and
prudent to bring her through to Cleveland at'tht time?
"(Objected to, objection overruled, and defendant excepted.)
"A. I think it was on my part."
George Ellis, who was a firefiian on the tug at the time, was
asked the following question:

UNION INS. CO. v, SMITH.
Opinion .of the Court.

"Q. What is the fact about whether vessels do sometimes,,
begin to leak in a calm, when you cannot explain how the
leak comes?
"(Objected to, objection overruled, and defendant excepted.)
"A. I could not explain that; I have not known of other
cases of the kind where you did not know the cause of the
leak."
And again:
'"Q. State whether it would have been good seamanship and
prudent ,to try to tow the Sprague across the Lake to Cleveland at the time you got ready to leave her.
"(Objected to, objection overruled, and defendant excepted.)
"A. Well, sir, if I was to get Lake Erie for it, I would not
take it across -yes;

I mean it was not prudent.":

Walter S. Rose, the mate of the tug, who was on board of
her, was asked this question:
"Q. So that, when you got "to Detroit, state what need or
occasion there was for your stopping there because of any leakage that you were not able to control; whether there was anything of that kind.
"(Objected to, objection overruled, and defendant exceptdd.)
"A. There was nothing any more than there was all the
time down -just

the same."

And again:
"Q. What do you say as to its being -Orfitter of prhdence
for you to come past Port Huron, or to couie past Detroit, and
to try and get the tig to the home port; in order to have her
repaired there? The question is, whether the captain exercisedreasonable prudence in bringing her by?
"(Objected to, objection, overruled, and defendant excepted.)
"A. I think he did."
The plaintiff himself, as a witness, was asked whether, on'
the facts of the case, detailed to him in the question, it was
the exercise of good seamanship and prudence, when the vessel
reached Port Huron, to continue right on, to bring her to her
home port of Cleveland. He answered that he would consider'
it good seamanship.
He was also asked:

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

"Q. If you could stop the leak state whether any such boat
would be seaworthy.
"A. I would not consider her unseaworthy to tow to
Detroit or any other port."
He was also asked, on the facts, as to its being prudent to
keep on from Detroit and bring the tug to her home port. lfe
answered that he thought it would be prudent and good sea,
manship.
The entry in respect to each of these three questions is "(Objected to, 'objection overruled, and defendant excepted.)"
Similar objections were made to the testimony of Edward
Kelly, an expert witness.
In regard to Bowen, the objection is made that he was not
qualified as an expert. But he was the master of this vessel
and on board of her at the time; had been her master from
the time she went out in the spring until she was lost; had
made two or three trips in her the fall before; had run another
tug from Cleveland for a few weeks in 1884, before taking the
Sprague; and had been engaged in the navigation of the
Lakes and adjacent waters about twenty or twenty-one years,
off and on. The witness Ellis had followed the Lakes for
twenty-seven years, and had been connected with tugs about
four years, and was a fireman on this tug. The witness Rose
had followed the Lakes for thirty-six years, and was mate of
the tuig, and had been second mate of a steam barge for one
season. The plaintiff had been in the tug business for twenty
or twenty-five years, and had run a tug alt around Lake Erie.
The witness Kelly had been a part of two seasons in i tug;
had sailed sailing vessels, steamers, and steam barges; and had
sailed a few trips in this tug.
In regard to the objection that these witnesses were not
qualified as experts, in addition to the fact that three of them
were on board of the tug at the time, and in its service, the
court charged the jury, that the value of expert testimony
depended very fargely upon the skill, the information or
knowledge, and the experience of the witness; and that, in
giving weight to the expert testimony, the jury should be careful to ascertain what the evidence established as to the truth

UNION INS.

CO. v. SMITH.

Opinion of the Court.

of the hypothetical questions put to the witnesses by the counsel on the one side and on the other.
We think that the witnesses in question were competent to
give their testimony to the jury, in response to the questions
asked of them, and that the question as to the weight of the
evidence of each of them was one f6r the jury, in view of the
testimony of each as to his experience. Tranmportation Line
v. Hope, 95 U. S. 297, 298; AcGowan v. American Tan-Bark
Co., 121 U. S. 575, 609.
It is also objected, that the testimony given by the five witnesses above mentioned was not the. proper subject of expert
testimony; that, under the policy in this case, the proper inquiry was not as to the prudence of the captain in passing
Port Huron; and that, if the vessel was, as a matter of fact,
unseaworthy, 6ither because of her rottenness or her unnavigability, or the broken and leaky condition of her stern, and if
the loss was occasioned by unseaworthiness, the deLendant was
not liable. But we think that the testimony referred to was
competent, in view of the questions the jury were to consider,
as properly laid before them by the court in its charge, to be
considered hereafter.
We see no objection to the introduction of the secondary
evidence as to the proofs of loss, on the failure of the defendant to produce them on notice. This applies to the evidence
of the witness W. B. Scott and of the plaintiff on that subject.
A.s to the other objections to the testimony of the witness
Scott, and to that of the plaintiff, and the objections to the
exclusion of a question asked of the defendant's witness Newton, and to the admission of testimony given by the witness
McNillie, and to the admission. of some testimony given by
Captain Bowen on rebuttal, and of testimony given on the
part of the plaintiff as to the value of the tug, it is sufficient
to say, that we see no objection to the rulings of the court, as
the testimony admitted was either competent, or, if not strictly
competent, was harmless, and that excluded was incompetent.
One of the objections to the exclusion of evidence was that
the defendant was not allowed to ask its witness, the chief
engineer of the tug at the time of the occurrence, what, if

As to the overruling of the motion of the defendant to take

it was a motion for a peremptory nonsuit against the will of
the plaintiff; and it was waived by the introduction by the
defendant of testimony in the further progress of. the case.

As to the motion of the defendant, at the close -of the testimony on both sides, to take the case from the jury and direct
a verdict for the defendant, we are of opinion that the case
was, on the evidence, one for the jury.
As to the exceptions to the charge of the court, they may,
perhaps, fairly be said to point sufficiently to the portions of
the charge which are hereinbefore set forth in brackets.
As to the fourteen requests to charge which were refused by
* the court, except so far as they' were covered by the chargo
which it had already given, the statement in the bill of exceptions is, that the defendant excepted to the "refusal to charge,"
that is, to the refusal to charge the requests as a whole. The
exception isa general one, to the refusal to charge the entire
series of the fourteen propositions; and it is well settled that
such a general exception is bad, provided any one of the series
is objectionable. Beaver v. Taylor, 93 U. S. 46; Torthington

Opinion of the Court.

having been excepted to, namely, the parts included in
brackets, the argument on behalf of the defendant is, that,
after the tugs shaft had been broken, so that she was unable
to navigate herself as a tug, she became unseaworthy for all
purposes; and that, if the plaintiff took the tug, while she was
in that condition, past a port where he might have had her
repaired, such conduct would prevent a recovery upon the
policy if she were lost while she continued in such unseaworthy condition, even though the loss did not arise from the
breaking of the shaft.
But the Circuit Court took the view, in its charge, and, as
we think, correctly, that, while the breaking of the shaft
might have rendered the tug unseaworthy for the purpose of
was compepropelling herself and towing other vessels, yet ittent for the plaintiff to prove, as he claimed to the jury the
fact was, that the master stopped the leakage occurring around
the broken shaft at the stern of the vessel, so far as would
make her seaworthy to be towed, and undertook to ba-e her
towed to the port of *Cleveland, which was her destination,
where he could have her repaired by her owner. The court
instructed the jury, in substance, that permitting the tug to be
towed in such condition, past Port Huron and Detroit, and
through the Detroit River, into Lake Erie, with the design to
take her to Cleveland for repairs, would not of itself constitute
such a breach of the policy as would deprive the plaintiff of
his right to recover thereon; and that, if the master of the
tug, in the exercise of reasonable prudence and discretion,,
took that course, after he had so far controlled the coming in
of water at the place where the break of the shaft had
occurred, as to render the vessel reasonably safe to undergo, at
that time of the year, the navigation proposed in the form proposed, it would be proper for the jury to consider, on all the
evidence, whether such condition of the vessel was the cause
of her ultimate loss, and, if so, whether, in taking her past a
port where she might have been repaired, the master was
guilty of incompetency, or of such lack of ordinary care in
navigating the vessel, as brought the case within the exceptions contained in the policy, as above set forth.

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

The contention of the defendant is, that, if the vessel became
unseaworthy from any cause in the course of her voyage, and
failed to put in at the first port where stich unseaworthiness
-could be repaired, that unseaworthiness operated to release
the insurer from liability, whether the loss resulted from such
unseaworthiness or not. But we are of opinion, that, by the
terms of the policy, the vessel was insured against all perils of
the lakes which should damage her, excepting perils and losses
-consequent upon and arising from, or caused by, the specified
and excluded causes applicable to and arising out of the facts
of this case, namely, incompetency of the master, or want of
-ordinary care and skill in navigating the vessel, rottenness,
inherent defects, and all other unseaworthiness.
The company is not released from liability by reason of the
existence of any of the excluded conditions, but is released
from such losses as are consequent upon and arise from or are
,caused by any of the specified, excluded causes. If, therefore,
the vessel was subjected to a peril of the lake, and sustained
loss which did not arise from, or was not caused by, gome one
of the excluded causes, the company was not released from
liability. Therefore, it was contended by. the plaintiff, that,
-although the shaft of the tug had been broken, in Lake Huron,
about seventy miles from Port Huron, yet, as the master had
.succeeded at the time in so stopping the leak around the shaft
that he had it under such control that he was able to have the
tug taken in tow, and, by moderate pumping, to keep her free
from water, and as, 'after reaching Port Huron, and finding
that the leak was under control, he continued his course to
Detroit, and as he there found that the leak was still under
-control and proceeded to go across Lake Erie, with a design to
reach Cleveland, where the vessel could be repaired by her.
•-owner, he acted with ordinary care. This question was submitted to the jury, under all the circumstances of the case, and
upon the opinions of experts, approving the course.
The question also arose, whether, when the vessel began to
fill with water upon Lake Erie, such filling with water Was
caused by the breaking of .the shaft or by some other peril;
and upon this point the, testimony of the master, who made a

'.UNION INS. CO. v. S3HTH.
Opinion of the Court.

particular examination at that time, was distinct, that the
leak which had existed at the time the shaft was broken, and
had been stopped by him, remained stopped at the time the
water was found to be coming in. There was other testimony
beafing upon the questions above stated, and which was fairly
submitted to*the jury, and upon which the verdict they gave
was justified.
The principle adopted by the Circuit Court in laying the
-ase before the jury was the proper one. In the insurance of
a vessel by a time policy, the warranty of seaworthiness is
complied with if the vessel be seaworthy at the commencement of the risk, and the fact that she subsequently sustains
-damage, and is not properly refitted at an intermediate port,
does not discharge the insurer from subsequent risk or loss,
provided such loss be not the consequence of the omission. A
defect of seaworthiness, arising after the commencement of
the risk, and permitted to continue from bad faith or want of
ordinary prudence or diligence on the part of the insured or
his agents, discharges the insurer from liability for any loss
which is the consequence of such bad faith, or want of prudence or diligence; but does not affect the contract of insurance as to any other risk or loss covered by the poligy and
not caused or increased by such particular defect. American

In view of all the facts in evidence, the court properly put
the case on this subject to the jury in these words:
"The Sprague having been temporarily repaired by calking
the leakage occasioned by the breaking of her shaft, and taken
in tow by the Wilcox, and in safety having reached Detroit,
the question presents itself as to the duty of the master or

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court

plaintiff to have the proper repairs made there before starting
on Lake Erie for her home port on Lake :Erie, and, failing to
do so, how does it affect the plaintiff's right to recover on this
policy? On this point I direct you, that if, when the Sprague
arrived at Detroit, the breaking of the shaft and the consequent leakage therefrom was such that an ordinarily prudent
and discreet master, of competent skill and judgment, would
have deemed it necessary to repair the vessel, so as to stop the
leak, before proceeding on the voyage to Cleveland, and you
find that the sinking of the vessel and its loss was occasioned
by his omission to do so, and would not otherwise have happened, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this suit.
But if you find, from the character of the injury and the leak,
that a master of competent skill and judgment might reasonably have supposed, in the exercise of ordinary care for the
safety of the vessel, that she was seaworthy for the voyage in
which she was then engaged, in the manner that she was to
make the trip to Cleveland in tow of the Wilcox, notwith'standing the leakage occasioned by such breaking of the shaft,
and on that account omitted to make such repair at Detroit,
*then such omission to make such repair at Detroit is .no bar to
a recovery in this suit."
Special objeption is made by the defendant to that portion
of the charge which says, that "the want of ordinary care at
the time of the loss in Lake Erie must be shown by a fair preponderance of the proof on behalf of the defendant, for the
reason that the defendant sets it up in its special defence, in
the form of a special answer, and in that respect takes upon
itself the establishment of the affirmative of that proposition."
The court had previously stated to the jury, that, to entitle
the plaintiff to -recover, he must show that he had complied
'with the terms of the policy, and that "it must appear from
the Whole proof, that the loss was not occasioned by the want
of ordinary care of the master in charge of the vessel, or on
account of being unseaworthy, as hereinafter stated, and -not
within the exceptions contained in the policy, against which
the d~fendant did nbt insure the plaintiff." The defendant
had undertaken by.expert testimony, to prove that-the master

did not exercise ordinary care, when he discovered the water,
gaining on his pumps in Lake Erie, because hd did not require
thq tug which was towing him to take him back to the Detroit
River, and it was in regard to this. claim of the defendant that
the court said what is thus specially objected to. We think
the instruction was proper in reference to the subject to which
it related.
We do not consider it necessary to discuss particularly any
of the other positions taken! by the defendant. They have all
of them been considered, we see no error in the record, and
