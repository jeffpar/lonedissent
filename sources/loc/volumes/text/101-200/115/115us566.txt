EFFINGER v. KENNEY, Trustee.
IN ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
VIRGINIA.
Argued November 10, 11, 1885.-Decided December 7, 1885.
Contracts made in the insurgent States, during the late civil war, between
residents of those States, with reference to Confederate notes as a standard
of value, and not designed to aid the insurrectionary government, may be
enforced in the National courts; and the value of the contracts is to be determined by the value of the Confederate notes in lawful money of th
United States at the time when and place where such contracts were made.
A statute of Virginia, of February, 1867, after declaring that, in an action or
suit or other proceeding for the enforcement of any contract, express or
implied, made between the 1st day of January, 1862, and the 10th of
April, 1865, it shall be lawful for either party to show, by parol or other
relevant testimony, what was the understanding and agreement of the
parties, either express or implied, in respect to the kind of currency in
which the same was to be performed, or with reference to which, as a
standard of value, it was made, provides "that when the cause of actioti
grows out of a sale or renting or hiring of property, whether real or personal, if the court, or, when it is a jury case, the jury, think that, under
all the circumstances, the fair value of the property sold, or the fair rent
or hire of it would be the most just measure of recovery in the action,
either of these principles may be adopted as the measure of the recovery instead of the express terms of the contract:" Held, That the statute in this
provision sanctions the impairment of contracts, which is not, under the
Federal Constitution, within the competency of the legislature of the
State. Accordingly, in a suit to enforce a lien for unpaid purchase money
of real estate sold during the war, for which a note was given payable in
dollars, but shown to have been made with reference to Confederate notes,
a decision that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the land at
the time of the sale, instead of the value of Confederate notes at that time,
was erroneous.

This case came from the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. It was brought in one of the Circuit Courts of that
State to enforce a vendor's lien claimed by James Kenney, the
plaintiff below, defendant in error here, as trustee of one Allen
C. Bryan, for the unpaid portion of the purchase money of
certain real estate sold to Jacob P. Effinger, the defendant
below and plaintiff in error here. The material facts of the

EFFINGER v. KENNEY.
Statement of Facts.

case were these: On the 7th of January, 1861, Allen C. Bryan
and wife conveyed all their estate, real and personal, to James
Kenney, in trust for the benefit of the wife and creditors of
Bryan. The real estate was situated in Rockingham County,
Virginia, and a portion of it, consisting of about 100 acres, was
knoNv as the "Home Farm" of Bryan. On the 30th of
March, 1863, Kenney, the trustee, sold this farm at public
auction to the highest bidder, pursuant to the deed of trust;
and at that sale Effinger became the purchaser, at $210 per
acre, one-third to be paid in cash and the balance in one and
two years from the date of sale, with the privilege of paying
in cash the first of these deferred payments. Effinger made
the cash payment and the first of the deferred payments, and
executed to the trustee his promissory note, or bond, as it is
termed in the record, for the second deferred payment, amounting to $7067.72, payable on the 30th of March, 1865, with interest from date, stating in the instrument that the amount
was the deferred payment on the "Home Farm" of Bryan.
The trustee and the purchaser were at the time residents and
citizens of Virginia. The first and second payments were
made in treasury notes of the Confederate States, but after
the maturity of the bond the third payment in such notes was
refused by the trustee, and no payment in any other currency
being made the present suit was brought. The Circuit Court
was of opinion that the sale was made with reference to notes
of the Confederate States as a standard of value; that the fair
value of the property on the day of sale "was the most just
measure of recovery;" and that such value was $80 an acre in
lawful currency of the United States. This conclusion as to
value was drawn from the fact that the land was assessed for
taxation at that sum before the civil war, and that during the
continuance of the war its value had not materially depreciated, the court observing that, "whilst the war had a
tendency to impair the value of all iduds of property, yet, as
to lands, that tendency was counteracted by the fact that they
were not liable to be destroyed, and, therefore, afforded a safer
means of investment than any other kind of property." It
accordingly awarded judgment for one-third the value of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.

land at the time of sale, estimating it to have been then worth
$80 an acre in lawful currency, with interest on the sum thus
adjudged to be due, and decreed a sale of the property to pay
the amount unless the same was paid within a time designated.
In adopting the rule stated to arrive at what it deemed the
"most just measure of recovery," the court acted in conformity
with a statute of Virginia, passed on the 28th of February, 1867,
amending and re-enacting sections of an act of the previous
year "providing for the adjustment of liabilities arising under
contracts or wills made between the first day of January, 1862,
and the tenth day of April, 1865." This act of 1867 provided:
"SEC. 1. That in any action or suit, or other proceedings for

the enforcement of any contract, express or implied, made or
entered into between the first day of January, eighteen hundred and sixty-two and the tenth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, it shall be lawful for either party to show,
by parol or other relevant testimony, what was the true understanding and agreement of the parties thereto, either express
or to be implied, in respect to the kind of currency in which the
same was to be fulfilled or performed, or with reference to
which as a standard of value it was made or entered into; and
in any action at law or suit in equity it shall not be necessary
to plead the agreement specially in order to admit such evidence: Provided, that when the cause of action grows out of
a sale or renting or hiring of property, whether real or personal, if the court (or when it is a jury case, the jury) think
that, under all the circumstances, thefair value of theproperty
sold, or the fair 'ent or hire of it, would be the most just measure of 'recoveryin the action, either of these principles may be
adopted as the measure of the recovery instead of the express
terms of the contract.
"SEC. 2. Whenever it shall appear that any such contract
was, according to the true understanding and agreement of the
parties, to be fulfilled or performed in Confederate States treasury notes, or was entered into with reference to such notes as
a standard of value, the same shall be liquidated and settled by
reducing the nominal amount due or payable under such contract in Confederate States treasury notes to its true value at

Mn. JUsTIcE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court. After
stating the case in the language above reported, he continued:
The contract of sale, which is the subject of consideration in
this case, was made in Virginia, between citizens of that State,
pending the late civil war, and with reference to notes of the
Confederate States as the standard of value. These notes had,
at that time, almost entirely superseded the use of coin, and
they constituted the principal currency within those States.
Not only the ordinary purchases of the necessaries of life, but
contracts of every description, which were to be performed
there, were made with reference to them. Such contracts
were not invalid between the parties because payable in those
notes, when not made in aid of the insurrectionary government. It was so held by this court in T/oirington v. Smith,
8 Wall. 1, where it was declared that they must be regarded
as a currency imposed on the community by irresistible force;
and that this currency must therefore be considered, in the
courts of law, in the same light as if it had been issued by a
foreign government temporarily occupying a part of the territory of the United States. "Contracts stipulating for payments in this currency," said Mr. Chief Justice Chase, speak,ing for the entire court, "cannot be regarded, for that reason
only, as made in aid of the foreign invasion in the one case, or
of the domestic insurrection in the other. They have no necessary relation to the hostile, government, whether invading or

Opinion of the Court.

insurgent. They are transactions in the ordinary course of
civil society, and, though they may indirectly and remotely
promote the ends of the unlawful government, are without
blame, except when proved to have been entered into with
actual intent to further invasion or insurrection. We cannot
doubt that such contracts should be enforced in the courts of
the United States, after the restoration of peace, to the extent
of their just obligation," pp. 11, 12. That case, like the present,
was a suit to enforce a vendor's lien for the unpaid purchase
money of real estate. The property was situated in Alabama
and was sold during the civil war for $45,000, of which sum all
but $10,000 was on the execution of the deed paid in Confederate treasury notes. For the residue the promissory note of
the purchaser was given. The parties were both residents and
citizens of that State. The plaintiff sought to enforce the note
for the full amount in lawful money of the United States.
The defendant proved that, at the time of sale, treasury notes
of the Confederate States constituted the only currency in ordinary use in Alabama, and that, with few exceptions, all business transactions were conducted in them; that the land was
then worth only $3000, in lawful money, and that the contract
price of $45,000 was, by agreement, to be paid in those notes.
When the case came to this court the question was considered
as to the admissibility of evidence to prove that the promise
for the payment of dollars, without qualifying words, was in
fact made for the payment of other than lawful dollars of the
United States. The court held that the evidence was admissible, observing that, whilst it is clear that a contract to pay
dollars, made between citizens of any State of the Union maintaining its constitutional relations with the National government, is a contract to pay lawful money of the United States,
and could not be modified or explained by parol evidence, "it
is equally clear, if in any other country coins or notes denominated dollars should be authorized of diffeient value from the
coins or notes which are current here under that name, that, in
a suit upon a contract to pay dollars made in that country,
evidence would be admitted to prove what kind of dollars
were intended, and, if it should turn out that foreign dollars

EFFINGER v. KENNEY.
Opinion of the Court.

were meant, to prove their equivalent value in lawful money
of the United States," p. 12; that such evidence does not modify or alter the contract, but simply explains an ambiguity
which, under the general rules of evidence, may be removed
by parol evidence. And the court added, that the people in
the insurgent States under the Confederate government were,
in legal contemplation, substantially in the same situation as
inhabitants of districts of a country occupied and controlled by
an invading belligerent; that contracts among them must be
interpreted and enforced with reference to the condition of
things created by the acts of the ruling power; and that in
their light it was hardly less than absurd to say that the dollars used in the insurgent States should be considered identical
in kind and value with the dollars constituting the money of.
the United States.
It being thus held that a contract made during the war, in
one of the insurgent States, between parties residing therein,
payable in Confederate notes, is not for that reason invalid,
and that parol evidence is admissible to show that by "dollars,"
used without qualifying words in a contract of that character
thus made, those notes were intended, it becomes important to
ascertain and lay down some definite rule, if possible, to determine their value, when the enforcement of such a contract
is sought in a Federal court, or damages are claimed for its
breach.
In Tlctringto v. Smith, above cited, the court held that the
plaintiff was entitled to recover the actual value of the Confederate notes at the time and place of contract in lawful money
of the United States.
In Wilmington. & Treldon Railroad Co. v. King, 91 U. S.3,
the contract made in North Carolina during the war was for
wood, and by its terms the wood was to be paid for in Confederate notes. In an action upon the contract the court below
refused to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to
recover only the value of the currency stipulated for the wood
sold, but stated that he was entitled to recover the value of the
wood without reference to the value of that currency. This
court held this to be nothing less than instructing the jury that

they could put a different value upon the property from that
placed by the parties at the time of the purchase. In its opinion the court referred to contracts made during the war in the
insurgent States between residents there, payable in Confederate notes, which of course became worthless at the close of
the war, and said it was manifest that, if these contracts were
to be enforced with anything like justice to the parties, evidence
must be received as to the value of the notes at the time and in
the locality where the contracts were made; and added, that
"in no other mode could the contract as made by the parties
be enforced. To have allowed any different rule in estimating
the value of the contracts, and ascertaining damages for their
breach, would have been to sanction a plain departure from the
stipulations of the parties and to make for them new and different contracts." p. 41. In reference to the statute of :North
Carolina which allowed the jury to place their own judgment
upon the value of the contract, and did not require them to
take the value stipulated by the parties, the court said: "A
provision of law of that character, by constituting the jury a
revisory body over the indiscretions and bad judgments of contracting parties, might in many instances relieve them from
hard bargains, though honestly made upon an erroneous estimate of the value of the articles purchased, but would create
an insecurity in business transactions which would be intolerable. It is sufficient, however; to say that the Constitution of
the United States interposes an impassable barrier to such new
innovation in the administration of justice, and with its conservative energy still requires contracts, not illegal in their
character, to be enforced as made by the parties, even against
any State interference with their terms." p. 5. The judgment
was accordingly reversed.
In Stewart v. &lamon, 94 U. S.434, the court held that the
amount in actual money represented by a promissory note, executed during the war in the insurgent States, payable in Confederate treasury notes, was to be determined by the value of
those notes in coin or legal currency of the United States at the
time when, and the place where the promissory note was made.
In Cook v. Lillo, 103 U. S. 79'2, the doctrines declared in the

EFFINGER v. KENNEY.
Opinion of the Court.

decisions mentioned were referred to as settled, although Thorington v. Smith was alone cited for them. The Chief Justice,
after observing that it had long been settled in this court, that
transactions in Confederate money during the late civil war
between the inhabitants of the Confederate States, within the
Confederate lines, not intended to promote the ends of the
Confederate government, could be enforced in the courts of the
United States, after the restoration of peace, to the extent of
their just obligation, said: "It is equally well settled that, if a
contract entered into under such circumstances, payable in dollars, was, according to the understanding of the parties, to be
paid in Confederate dollars, upon proof of that fact, the party
entitled to the payment can only recover the value of Confederate dollars in the lawful money of the United States," pp.
792-793.
In 2ives v. Duke, 105 U. S. 139, the same doctrines were
stated and followed. Mr. Justice Gray, in delivering the
opinion of the court, said: "It is settled by the decisions of
this court that a contract, made within the so-called Confederate States during the war of the rebellion, to pay a certain
sum in dollars, without specifying the kind of currency in
which it was to be paid, may be shown, by the nature of the
transaction and the attendant circumstances, as well as by the
language of the contract itself, to have contemplated payment
in Confederate currency; and, if that fact is shown, in an action upon the contract, no more can be recovered than the
value of that currency in lawful money of the United States,"
p. 140, citing the cases of Tliorington v. Smith, 8 Wall. 1; The
Confederate 117ote Case, 19 Wall. 548, 559; and 1ilrmingtorm &
Weldon iailroadCo. v. King, 91 U. S. 3. In The Confederate
NZfote Ca,.se, the doctrines of the previous decisions were also
stated and approved, but the bonds there in suit were distinguished from obligations payable in Confederate notes.
The several decisions mentioned, with one exception, were
rendered by the court with the concurrence of all its members.
In the excepted case only one judge dissented. It would seem,
therefore, to be no longer open to question, that where contracts were made in the insurgent States during the war be-

tween residents of those States, with reference to Confederate
notes as a standard of value, and were not designed to aid the
insurrectionary government, they may be enforced in our
courts; and that the value of the contracts is to be determined
by the value of the Confederate notes in lawful money of the
United States.
The measure of valuation adopted by the court below was
not in conformity with this rule. It allowed a recovery for the
value of the land instead of. treasury notes, which was nothing
less than substituting for the contract of the parties a new and
different one. The statute of the State which permitted this
estimate, whenever the court might think that the fair value of
the property would be "the most just measure of recovery,"
and pursuant to which the court acted, sanctions the impairment of contracts, which is not, under the Federal Constitution, within the competency of the State legislature.- It follows
that the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for
a new trial, in which the plaintiff will be permitted to recover
the value of the Confederate notes in lawful money of the
United States, and not the value of the land at the time of sale.
There is, however, a further question for consideration which
is not free from difficulty. The bond of the defendant, dated
March 30, 1863, is payable two years thereafter, that is, on
the 30th of March, 1865. At these respective dates the value
of the Confederate notes was materially different. At the
date of the bond their purchasing power was in Virginia at
least one-third less than that of lawful money of the United
States of the same nominal amount. At the maturity of the
bond it was greatly less, not more than one-twentieth of that
of lawful money. The Confederacy was then in the throes
of dissolution; a few days afterwards it ceased to be an
organized power, and the notes lost all appreciable value.
The condition upon which their payment was promised"after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the Confederate States and the United States of America "-had become impossible. It is evident, therefore, that, if their value
in lawful money is to be estimated at the maturity of the bond,
a nominal sum, not more than one-twentieth of its amount in

EFFINGER v. KENNEY
Opinion of the Cort.

Confederate currency, can be recovered. In the case of contracts maturing after the overthrow of the Confederacy, no
value whatever can be given to that currency.
In some of the cases decided by this court, to which we
have referred, it is said that the value of the Confederate notes
was to be estimated at the date and in the locality of the contract. Such is the language used in Thorington, v. Smith,
Wilmlngton & leldoa Railroad Co. v. King, and Stewart v.
Salanon. In the first case, the note was payable one day
after date. In the second case, it does not appear that the
time of payment was fixed. But in the third case, the note
was payable one year after date, and the court is careful to
state that the value of the Confederate currency was to be
estimated in lawful money of the United States at the time
when and the place where the note was made. And this rule
was prescribed in estimating the value of the Confederate
currency for the balance due on the note after its maturity.
Where a contract is for the delivery of specific articles, the
rule undoubtedly is that the damages recoverable for its breach
are to be determined by the value of the articles at the time
and place of their delivery. Where a contract is payable in a
specified currency, the rule is also clear that such currency is
demandable and receivable at the maturity of the contract,
whatever change in its value by increase or depreciation may
have taken place in the mean time. The damages recoverable
for a breach of the contract are to be measured by the value of
the currency at its maturity. But in these rules it is assumed
that the articles to be delivered are lawful property, and that
the currency to be paid is a lawful currency, and that, therefore, in the creation and exchange of both no public duty is
violated. The treasury notes of the Confederate States constituted, under the laws of the United States, neither lawful
property nor lawful currency. They were the promises of an
insurgent and revolutionary organization, payable only when
its success should be established by a treaty of peace with the
United States. Of the value of such promises the National
courts will make no inquiry, except as they were receivable in
contracts not designed to further the insurrection. They were

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.
Opinion of the Court.

receivable in such contracts because imposed as a currency
upon the community by irresistible force. Their intrinsic value
was nothing, but their exchangeable value, by reason of their
enforced circulation, was the estimate of them at the time in
lawful money of the United States. The relation between
them and coin and other lawful money was well known in the
community, as it was only with coin or other lawful money as
a standard of value that commerce was conducted between the
insurgents and persons outside of the Confederacy. Persons
then parting with lands and goods for Confederate notes, or
for the promise of them, attached to them this exchangeable
value, and expected to receive it then or afterwards. They
did not intend to surrender, or suppose they were surrendering,
their property without any consideration, if the Confederacy
should fail, and its notes lose this exchangeable value. They
expected an equivalent in any event. Therefore, as having the
value thus given to them at the time and place of their receipt,
or the promise of them, the National courts will treat them,
but not as having a value at any other time or place. Any
other rule would involve considerations of inextricable difficulty, and would be inconsistent with justice in determining the
value of contracts thus payable, where they matured near the
close or after the overthrow of the Confederacy.
It follows, therefore, that on the new trial the plaintiff will
be allowed to recover for this exchangeable value of Confederate notes, in which the bond was payable, estimated at
the time and place of its execution, in lawful money of the
United States.
