the record.

.r. George A. .Sourse for defendant in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.
When this cause was reached on the call of the docket it
was submitted by the defendant in error on a printed brief.
An assignment of errors was not annexed to or returned with
the writ of error, as required by ยง 997 Rev. Stat. At the last
term the counsel for the plaintiff in error was permitted to
withdraw his appearance, and no one has taken his place. No
argument has been submitted in behalf of the plaintiff in error,
and no errors have been assigned in any form. We, therefore,
affirm the judgment without opening the record.
Af rmed.
