Argument for Appellant.

ST. LOUIS HAY AND GRAIN CO. v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROA1 THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No 41. Argued October 30, November 2, 1903.-Decided November 16, 103.

When a void but not illegal contract of sale has been performed on both
sides, the vendor cannot recover on a quantum valebat less the amount
already paid.
The United States bought hay for a camp, providing that the quantity
bought be decreased at its option, not exceeding twenty per cent, and
if the troops should be wholly or in part withdrawn the contract should
become inoperative to the extent of such reduction, and that deliveries
were to begin within five days and proceed at daily rates of at least one
sixtieth of the amount, or in such quantities and in such times afterward
as might be designated by the quartermaster. The troops were withdrawn, orders were delayed beyond sixty days and a little less than the
whole amount was ordered. The claimant protested and claimed damages but accepted payment for the whole without reserving any rights
at the time.
Held that there was no breach of contract by the United States even if it
was still open to the claimants to demand damages in case of a breach,
and if the setting up of the invalidity of the contract by the United States
in answer to the demand would have opened the way to a quantum valebat.

THE facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. William B. King were on the brief, for appellant, cited

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradt for the United States:
It has been held that § 3744, Rev. Stat., is a statute of frauds
relating to contracts with the United States. Clark v. United
States, 95 U. S. 539. And where the contract is executory and
is not written it is not enforceable under § 3744, but where the
agreement has been fully executed and the goods delivered
and paid for an action cannot be maintained on the quantum
meruit.
The quantum meruit could only be resorted to when the defendant is in default, Galvin v. Prentiss, 45 N, Y. 164; Day

constitutes a complete defence to an action on the quantum

It is a well settled principle that the statute of frauds has
no application to an executed agreement. Remington v. Palmer, 62 N. Y. 31; Larson v. Johnson, 78 Wisconsin, 306; House

IR. JUSTICE HOLMus

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims
dismissing the appellant's petition. 37 C. Chns. 281. The petition alleges a contract by the United States to buy 9,000,000
pounds of hay from the claimant at the rate of sixty-one and
one-half cents per hundred weight, a refusal by the Government to take the hay at the rate of one-sixtieth daily, as required by the contract according to the claimant's interpretation, and a failure to accept two hundred and fifty-five
thousand two hundred and ninety-one pounds out of the nine
million. The rest, it is admitted, was taken and paid for at
contract rates. The claimant seeks compensation for an increased price paid by it, increased cost of transportation and
loss of anticipated profits, caused by the delay, all as damages
for the breach of the contract, or, alternatively, the market
value of the hay less the amount paid by the United States.
The answer is a general denial.
The Court of Claims finds that during the late war with
Spain an advertisement was published by a quartermaster for
9,000,000 pounds of hay, among other things, seemingly for

use in Camp George H. Thomas, Georgia, and that in connection with it the following information was furnished: "The
foregoing are the estimated quantities which will be required,
but bids will be accepted in whole or in part . . . and
awards made under accepted bids will provide that the quantities awarded may be increased or decreased at the option of
the United States, not exceeding twenty per centum thereof
and further, that if the troops should be wholly or
in part withdrawn, the awards shall become inoperative to
the extent of such reduction. . . . Hay and straw.
Deliveries of the supplies to begin within five days from date
of award, and proceed at daily rates of at least one-sixtieth of
amount, or in such quantities and at such times afterwards, as
may be designated by the chief quartermaster," etc. A bargain was made on these terms on July 12, 1898. Shipments
were made, amounting, on August 27, 1898, to 4,685,949
pounds. On August 28 the quartermaster telegraphed to the
claimant not to ship any more hay until notified to do so.
This suspension of orders was due to the withdrawal of troops.
The claimant then had 1W(Y carloads in transit, which it was
obliged to sell for what it could get, and protested against the
stoppage. At different dates between September 12 and
May 18 following the quartermaster telegraphed orders for
hay, which were filled. Hay meantime had risen in value
and cost the claimant more than it would have cost in the
summer. Accordingly the claimant asked to be relieved from
delivery, but the quartermaster refused, holding back money
due to the claimant as security to compel performance. The
claimant went on with deliveries, and in December was asking
for orders "on our contract," on April 27 returned a voucher
"covering hay on our contract," on May 27 sent a bill of lading
and invoice "ordered upon our contract to day," and on
June 24, 1899, wrote "we would like to know how soon you
expect us to put in the balance of the hay due upon the contract, as we are anxious to get it all cleaned up." It would
seem that no hay was ordered after June 13. The claimant

Opinion of the Court.

delivered the hay and received full payment for it under the
contract, without protest or attempt to reserve any rights at
that time. The last payment was made on July 24, 1899.
On May 11, 1899, however, the claimant wrote to the quartermaster, claiming damages on account of the government not
taking the hay at the rate of one-sixtieth per day and on
June 28, and later, the quartermaster approved the claim.Although, no doubt, both parties supposed their agreement
binding, the Court of Claims held, and it is not disputed, that
the contract was within Rev. Stat. § 3744, and not having
been "reduced to writing, and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof," could not have been
sued upon if it had not been performed. Clark v. United
States, 95 U. S. 539; South Boston Iron Co. v. United States,
118 U. S. 37. See Monroe v. United States, 184 U. S. 524. It

is argued by the claimant on this ground that it is entitled to
maintain a quantum valebat.

On the facts stated it is evident that the claimant has no
case. The invalidity of the contract is immaterial after it has
been performed.

When a lawful transfer of property is exe-

cuted it does not matter whether the terms of the execution
were void or valid while executory; the transfer cannot be
revoked or the terms changed. A promise to make a gift
does not bind, but a gift cannot be taken back, and a transfer
in pursuance of mutual promises is not made less effectual by
those promises or by the fact that money was received in exchange. The contract may be void, as such, but it expresses
the terms on which the parties respectively paid their money
and delivered their goods. See Savage v. United States, 92
U. S. 382. The proposition does not need to be argued or
explained more at length. Of course, different considerations would come in if the claimant had been subjected to a
motive from which it had a right to be free, as, for instance,
by fraud or duress. But there was nothing which the law
could recognize as duress, and the suggestion that it was peculiarly the duty of the officers of the Government to see that

the contract was put in binding form, is very far from making
out an analogy to fraud. The claimant was bound to know
the law at its peril. The agent of the'United States made no
representation, and the claimant in no way purported to submit its judgment to him, if that would have bettered its case.
But it is said that this is not the simple case of mutual
performance of a void contract, but that the United States,
although it has paid the price, has broken the contract in
respect of time. It may be said that if the United States,
instead of paying for the hay, had set up the invalidity of the
contract, the claimant could have sued on a quantum valebat.
Clark v. United States, 95 U. S. 539, 542, 543; Bacon v. Parker,
137 Massachusetts, 309, 310, 311. And it might be argued that
the same result would follow if the United States, after paying
the price, were compelled to rely upon the invalidity of the
contract in answer to a claim of damages for a breach. Acceptance of payment by the vendor i&not necessarily a waiver
of such a claim. Garfield & Proctor Coal Co. v. Fitchburg
Railroad, 166 Massachusetts, 119, 123. But we need not consider the questions suggested, because we agree with the Court
of Claims that there was no breach. The right to diminish
the order and to change the quantities and times was reserved
in the fullest and most express terms, and especially with regard to the event which happened, the withdrawal of the
troops. Therefore, if, in view of the protest and claim made
by the claimant, we should assume that the payment of the
contract price did not purport to be in full satisfaction of all
claims under the contract, which would be going very far and
*would be against the findings, still there is no valid claim
under it, because the United States has done all that it undertook to do. It is true that hay is an article varying greatly
in price at different seasons of the year, and that would have
been a reason for holding time of the essence, if the contract
had fixed a time; but the contract left the time open, as we
have said, and the claimant must be held to the bargain which
it made, although it has been disappointed in reasonable hopes.
Judgment affirmed.
