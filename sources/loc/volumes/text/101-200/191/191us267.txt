Opinion of the Court.

McLOUGHLIN v. RAPHAEL TUCK CO.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 73. Argued November 11, 12, 1903.-Decided November 30, I03.
The penal provisionsof ยง4693, R. S., as amended bythe act of March 3, 1891,
had no extraterritorial operation and did not embrace the act of affxing in a foreign country to a publication, a false statement that it was
copyrighted under the laws of the United States.
Prior to the amendment of Mlarch 3, 1897, there was no provision in the
copyright laws forbidding the importation into, or the sale after its importation within, the United States of an article falsely stamped with
the copyright notice in a foreign country and the proviso in the amending act expressly saved the right-to sell such an article if it had been imported prior thereto.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. A. Bell Makomson for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Harold Binney for defendant in error. Mr. Louis C.
Ragener was on the brief.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

Section 4963 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the
act of March 3, 1891, relating to the notice of copyright to be
affixed to copyrighted articles, provided as follows:
"Every person who shall insert or impress such notice, or
words of the same purport, in or upon any book, map, chart,
dramatic, or musical composition, print, cut, engraving, or
photograph, or other article, for which he has not obtained a
copyright, shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars,
recoverable one-half for the person who shall sue for such
penalty, and one-half to the use of the United States."

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

191 U. S.

On March 3, 1897, the foregoing provisions were amended,
29 Stat. 694, c. 392, by the following:
"Every person who shall insert or impress such notice, or
words of the same purport, in or upon any book, map, chart,
dramatic or musical composition, print, cut, engraving or
photograph or other article, whether such article be subject
to copyright or otherwise, for which he has not obtained a
copyright, or shall knowingly issue or sell any article bearing
a notice of United States copyright which has not been copyrighted in this country; or shall import any book, photograph,
chromo, or lithograph or other article bearing such notice of
copyright or words of the same purport, which is not copyrighted in this country, shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars, recoverable one-half for the person who shall sue
for such penalty and one-half to the use of the United States;
and the importation into the United States of any book,
chromo, lithograph, or photograph, or other article bearing
such notice of copyright, when there is no existing copyright
thereon in the United States, is prohibited; and the Circuit
Courts of the United States sitting in equity are hereby authorized to enjoin the issuing, publishing, or selling of any article
marked or imported in violation of the United States copyright laws, at the suit of any person complaining of such
violation: Provided, That this act shall not apply to any importation of or sale of such goods or articles brought into
the United States prior to the passage hereof."
The state of the law prior to 1897, pertinent to this case, was
therefore this: A penalty was imposed of $100 for untruthfully
impressing upon an article which was subject to be copyrighted
in the United States the fact that the same had been copyrighted, but there was no provision or penalty concerning the
importation from a foreign country of an article which was
untruthfully stamped in such country as having been copyrighted in the United States, and no express provision or penalty concerning the sale of an article in the United States which
was untruthfully stamped as copyrighted. The amendment

Opinion of the Court.

of 1897 caused the previous provision as to untruthfully stamping a notice of copyright to apply, although the article was not
subject to copyright under the law of the United States, and
prohibited the importation of an article untruthfully stamped
from a foreign country, and also prohibited the sale of an article in the United States which was falsely stamped, the penalty
previously provided being made applicable to the added prohibitions.
The plaintiff in error in 1898 commenced this action in the
Circuit Court of the United States against the defendant in
error, to recover the $100 penalty, provided in the statute, for
each of eighty-three alleged distinct violations of the statute.
The basis of the first to the seventieth cause of action was
asserted to be that on or about the first day of August, 1896,
the defendant, "at the city of New York, in the State of New
York, did publish and issue a certain picture book or booklet"
(a distinct article being named in the statement of each of the
seventy distinct causes of action) "and in and upon said book
did knowingly insert and impress a false and fictitious notice
that the same was copyrighted. . . ." The seventy-first
and seventy-second causes of action charged that the defendant on the eleventh day of June, 1897, in the city of New York,
"did knowingly issue and sell a certain picture book," described therein, with a false notice of copyright stamped on it.
The seventy-third to the eighty-third and last cause of action
charged the commission as to different publications, of like
acts, in the city of New York on or about April 26, 1897.
On the trial to a jury the defendant admitted that all the
publications referred to had on them an untruthful statement
that they had been copyrighted under the laws of the United
States, which statement had been affixed in a foreign country
at their request and for their account. It was also proved
by the defendant, without conflict in the testimony, that all
the publications having on them the untruthful statement of
copyright were imported into the United States prior to the
enactment of the amendment of 1897. Under this state of

the proof the trial court instructed a verdict for the defendant. Error was prosecuted by the plaintiff to the Circuit
Court of Appeals and that court affirmed the judgment. 115
Fed. Rep. 85. The court held that the penal provisions of
the law had no extraterritorial operation, and therefore did
not embrace the act of affixing in a foreign country to a publication a false statement that it was copyrighted under the
laws of the United States. Concerning the sales made after
the passage of the amendment of 1897, the court held that the
trial court had correctly instructed the jury that as the books
so sold after the amendment of 1897 were imported into the
United States prior thereto, the right to sell them in the United
States was saved by the proviso of that amendment.
The court below was clearly right in its conclusions as to
the non-extraterritorial operation of the law as it stood prior
to the amendment of 1897. Flash v. Conn, 109 U. S. 371, 376.
In saying this we do not wish to be considered as holding that
where an act done in a foreign country against a penal provision of the law of the United States is but the initial step in
accomplishing a subsequent violation in the United States of
other penal provisions, that the act done in the foreign country
might not, under some circumstances, be treated as having
been performed in the United States. On this question we
intimate no opinion whatever, as the circumstances of the case
do not require us to do so. Under the law as it stood prior to*
1897 there was no provision forbidding the importation of an
article falsely stamped in a foreign country, or prohibiting the
sale in the United States of an article falsely stamped. There
could, therefore; be no possible relation between subsequent
lawful acts performed in the United States concerning the
article falsely stamped in a foreign country.
The court was also manifestly right concerning the articles
'falsely stamped which were imported into the United States
prior to the amendment of 1897, but sold in the United States
subsequent to that amendment. The proviso expressly excluded from the operation of that amendment "any importa-

tion of or sale of such goods or articles brought into the United
States prior to the passage thereof." Whilst this was not disputed in the argument at bar, it was insisted that the court
below erred in affirming the act of the trial court in instructing a verdict on this subject, because the evidence did not
unquestionably establish that the articles which were sold
after March 3, 1897, were in fact imported prior to that date.
To support this contention the evidence which is contained in
the bill of exceptions is referred to. We are of opinion that
the claim is without merit, and that from the testimony, as
preserved in the bill of exceptions, it results that the trial court
correctly instructed the jury on the subject.
It is urged, however, that error was committed by the trial
court in the admission of proof concerning the date of the importation of the articles sold after March 3, 1897. Whilst we
think the contention is without merit, we shall not review the
grounds upon which it is based, because it is not open to inquiry
upon the record before us. No error concerning the admission
or rejection of testimony was assigned in the Circuit Court of
Appeals, and that court, in consideling the case, treated it as
involving only two issues, the extraterritorial operation of the
provisions of the law, as it stood prior to March 3, 1897, and
the effect of the proviso which formed a part of that amendment. And this upon the assumption that the correctness of
the ruling of the lower court concerning the admission of
testimony was unchallenged by the plaintiff in error. We say
upon the assumption, since the opinion of the Court of Appeals
makes no reference to any question concerning the admissibility of testimony, and because the assignment of errors
made for that court was directed to the adequacy of the
"admissions and testimony" to sustain the action of the trial
court in instructing a verdict.

Affirmed.
MR.JusTicE Hormrs did not hear the argument and took
Tio part in the decision of this case.
