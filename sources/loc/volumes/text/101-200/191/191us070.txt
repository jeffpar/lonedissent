HUBBERT v. CAMPBELLSVILLE LUMBER CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 31. Argued October 20, 1903.-Decided November9,1903.
A statute authorizing an issue of municipal bonds was amended by an act
increasing the amount authorized and also giving special remedies in
addition to, and not in lieu of, those given by the original act, but directing that the bondg "shall on their face stipulate" that the holders
are entitled to the remedies contained in the amending as well as in the
original act. The bonds were issued after the amending act was passed,
and contained a statement that they were issued in pursuance of the
original act and only for the amount authorized thereby. They did not
contain any reference to the amending act or stipulation that the
holders were entitled to the remedies given thereby.
H~eld, that in the absence of such stipulation the holders were not entitled
to the remedies given only by the amending act.

ON March 18, 1878, the general assembly of Kentucky passed
an act, vol. 1, p. 554, c. 483, authorizing the county of Taylor
to compromise its debts and issue new bonds of the county not
exceeding in amount $125,000, and also authorizing the Circuit Court, in case of a judgment on any of such bonds and a
refusal by the county within thirty days to levy a tax sufficient
to pay it, to make an order based on the last previous assessment levying a tax and appointing a collector. On February 27, 1882, an amendatory act was passed increasing the
issuable amount to $150,000, providing that any judgment
rendered thereon should constitute a lien on all the real and
personal property in the county subject to taxation, and also
that, if the court rendering the judgment should be of opinion
that such serious obstruction was likely to be offered as would
materially delay the enforcement of the judgment, it should
refer the matter to a commissioner with instructions to ascertain and report the amount proportionally necessary for the
holders or owners of any such property to pay in order to raise

promptly a sum sufficient to pay the judgment. Personal
judgments were authorized against the parties found to be
the owners of property within the limits of the county, to be
enforced by executions as other personal judgments. Section 10, vol. 1, c. 306, p. 558, reads as follows:
"Sec. 10. The bonds to be issued under the act to which
this is an amendment shall, on their face, stipulate that the
holders of any of them, or any coupon thereof, shall be entitled to the remedies for the collection of the same herein,
and in the act to which this is an amendment, provided for."
Bonds were issued by the county, some of which passed into
the possession of the plaintiff, who brought suit and obtained
judgment against the county in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Kentucky.
The bonds did not contain the stipulation referred to in
section 10, but did contain the following recital:
"This is one of an issue amounting in all to $125,000, authorized by an act of the general assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, approved March 18, 1878."
Each bond also bore the following endorsement:
"Issued by authority of an act of the general assembly of
the State of Kentucky, approved March 18, 1878."
On application for further relief the Circuit Court awarded
to the plaintiff the benefit of the special provisions of the
amendatory act of 1882, but the Circuit Court of Appeals held
that he was not entitled to them. 50 C. C. A. 435; 112 Fed.

Statutes affording substantially similar remedies for enforcement of municipal bonds have been sustained in Stansell
v. Levee Board, 13 Fed. Rep. 846; Supervisors v. Rogers, 7

for streets and sewers it is held that notice by publication is
due process of law. Lent v. Tillson, 140 U. S. 316; Paulsenv.

Portland, 149 U. S. 30. In the case at bar it is not disputed
that the three weeks' notice by publication, required by section 5 of the amended act, was properly given.
Section 10 of the act was only intended to make the bonds
attractive to purchasers and was directory and not mandatory.
French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506; Lyon v. Alley, 130 U. S. 185;
Erhardt v. Schroeder, 155 U. S. 129. Where the ordinary
remedies have proved ineffectual to coerce payment of a
former issue of bonds the remedy given by this statute was
just and as inexpensive as could be devised. There are precedents for this course. Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall. 175;
Thompson v. Allen County, 115 U. S. 559; Stansell v. Levee
Board, 13 Fed. Rep. 846. As to the question of repeal it is
sufficient to say that the remedy afforded by the act was a
part of the contract and was beyond the reach of repeal.

And see O'Mahoney v. Bullock, 97 Kentucky, 774; Pearce v.
Mason County, 99 Kentucky, 364; Corington v. Highlands, 24
Ky. Law Rep. 433. Sections 1839 and 1840, Kentucky statutes do not work a repeal when sections 465 and 907 are
considered.
The validity of the tax cannot be affected by the name of
the writ or paper under which the officer acts. Turpin v.
Lemon, 187 U. S. 51. As to whether plaintiff was real owner
of bonds judgments against corporations are conclusive upon
their stockholders. Morawetz on Corporations, sec. 619; Angell & Ames, see. 629. The act of 1882 was not contrary to
the Kentucky constitution distributing the powers of the government. Pennington v. Woolfolk 79 Kentucky, 16, distinguished. The act conferring power upon the county court
of assessing delinquent taxes was proper although the court
could levy assessments without such an act. Thompson

Argument for Respondent.

The debt of the county became the debt of the individual
citizens. Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall. 175; Stansell v. Levee
Board, 13 Fed. Rep. 851; Eames v. Savage, 77 Maine, 212;

Ames, sec. 629; United States v. Johnson, 6 Wall. 6.
Mr. Ernest Macpherson for respondent:
I. Respondent does not oppose the payment by the county
of the bonds, nor imposition of just assessments. It objects
to proceedings by the county court distributing the assessment unjustly and without respondent being heard.
The remedy given in the act is statutory only and a court
acting thereunder is limited in its powers by the statute.
E. T. Va. & Ga. v. Southern Tel. Co., 112 U. S. 306. A tax
not assessed as provided by law cannot be enforced. Cooley

II. The assessments were made in violation of the uniformity
and equality provisions of the Kentucky constitution. Const.
sec. 171. Holzhauer v. City of Newport, 15 Ky. Law. Rep.
188. A levy in excess of the proportionate amount necessary
is unlawful. Porter v. Rockford &c. R. R., 76 Illinois, 564;
Commonwealth v. Hamilton Mfg. Co., 12 Allen (Massachusetts),
300. The excessive levies were not by error but by design to
compel a few to pay the whole debt. A statute is mandatory
which limits the amount of taxes. Cooley on Taxation, 2d ed.
429; Commonwealth v. Savings Bank, 5 Allen, 428; Huse v.
Merriam, 2 Greenl. 375.; Case v. Dean, 16 Michigan, 12; C. N.
0. & T. R. R. Co. v. Commonwealth, 81 Kentucky, 509.

imposition of entire debt on a few taxpayers. RyersoA v.
Boorman, 8 N. J. Eq. 705; Rees v. Watertown, 19 Wall. 119.

bringing themselves within its terms. McClure v. Town of
Oxford, 94 U.S. 429; Crow v. Oxford, 119 U. S. 215; Gibson v.
Dayton, 123 U. S. 59.
VII. The act of 1882 had been repealed before this action
was commenced. Const. sec. 59; secs. 1839, 1840, Kentucky
Statutes; sec. 907, Statutes, does not apply.
VII. The Civil Code of Kentucky, secs. 474 to 477, gives
petitioner a complete remedy by mandamus. Elliott v.

after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER,

Conceding, without deciding, that both acts of the general
assembly of Kentucky were in all respects constitutional and
valid, and that the proceedings of the Circuit Court were in
strict compliance therewith, we notice only the single question
of the effect of the omission from the bonds of the stipulation
required by section 10, as well as of any reference to the amendatory act, and are of opinion that the omission is fatal to the
special relief provided for in that act.
There is nothing in the nature of things nor in the terms of
the two acts which prevents the parties, the county and the
recipient of the bonds, from contracting for solely the remedies
provided in the original act. The latter act provided remedies not in lieu of but in addition to those given by the former.
There is nothing on the face of the bonds to indicate that
either of the parties had in contemplation the provisions of
the amendatory act. On the contrary, the bonds in terms
state that they are of an issue amounting to $125,000, authorized by the original act. As the amendatory act authorized the issue of $150,000, and as no reference is made
to that act, the language of the bond plainly excludes it as

191 U. S.

the basis of authority, and therefore as plainly implies that
the remedies by that act were not contracted for by the county.
We need not stop to inquire what would be the effect of a
recital on the face of the bonds that they were issued under
the authority of the amendatory act, or whether such recital
would obviate the necessity of complying with the provisions
of section 10, for there is no reference to such act, and the
bonds on their face do not purport to be issued under its authority. So that the question is whether the plaintiff, in the
absence of any such stipulation as is required by section 10,
without any reference in the bonds to the amendatory act,
and when they purport to be issued under the authority of
the original act, can avail himself of the remedies not provided for by the original and only granted in the amendatory
act.
Much is said in the opinion of the Court of Appeals as.well
as in the briefs of counsel as to the difference between a directory and a mandatory provision, the plaintiff claiming that
section 10 is simply directory, while the defendant insists that
it is mandatory. In that opinion these authorities are cited:
"'By directory provision,' says Judge Cooley, 'is meant that
they are to be considered as giving directions which ought to
be followed, but not as so limiting the power in respect to
which the directions are given that it cannot effectually be
exercised without observing them.' Cooley's Constitutional
Limitations, star page 74.
"Lord Penzance, in Howard v. Bodington, L. R. 2 P. Div.
211, after commenting on the difficulty of gathering any rule
from the cases, said: 'I believe, as far as any rule is concerned,
you cannot safely go further than that in each case you must
look to the subject-matter; consider the importance of the
provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of that
provision to the general object intended to be secured by the
act, and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether
the matter is what is called imperative or directory."'
Without attempting to state any general rule, if indeed one

191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

such exists, for distinguishing between a directory and a
mandatory provision, it is sufficient to say that when a statute
provides an extraordinary remedy to the holder of bonds containing an express stipulation that he "shall be entitled" to
that remedy, it should not be adjudged that he is also entitled
to it in the absence of such stipulation, for it is a reasonable
presumption that if the county in issuing the bonds intended
to contract for such extraordinary remedy it would have complied with the express provisions of the statute and incorporated the stipulation into. the bonds. That the authority in
this amendatory act to proceed directly against the several
owners of property in the county is not an ordinary remedy
for the collection of bonds is true of the State of Kentucky
and generally of the States of the Union. Indeed, the original act gave something more than the ordinary remedy, and
when the amendatory act provides for what it must be conceded is under the circumstances an extraordinary remedy it
would seem reasonable to hold that all of the provisions of the
statute which grant such remedy should be complied with
before it can be considered as contracted for.
We are of opinion that the Court of Appeals did not err, and
its judgment is
Affirmed.
