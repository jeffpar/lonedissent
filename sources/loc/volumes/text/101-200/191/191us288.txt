equitably, he ought to pay is easily and certainly determinable
from the conceded facts in the case.
In the case at bar because certain deductions were not made,
although there was a large sum assessable even if the deductions were allowed, the injunction granted has prevented the
collection of any part of the assessments, and for twelve years
the stockholders in these Lynchburg banks have paid not one
dollar of taxes by reason of their ownership of such shares.
This is inequitable and unjust, and a court of equity should
not be made the instrument by which such injustice is continued.
Although we reach the conclusion above stated on the ground
we have discussed, it is not to be inferred that we regard the
other grounds untenable. We intimate no opinion in regard
to them. To the end that complainant may, if it so elect, pay
as provided in this opinion, and then commence further proceedings, the dismissal of the bill will be without prejudice,
and as thus modified the decree of the Circuit Court is

Affirmed.

Statement of the Case.

a license from another State, and has been sued in a court of that State,
the fact that the license is subject to be revoked if the company should
remove the action to the Federal courts, furnishes no ground for appealing to a Federal court to take jurisdiction of a suit in equity to cancel the
policy if otherwise the court would have no jurisdiction.
The theory that a complainant has no adequate remedy at law because it
would not have the same control over an action brought against it as
defendant as it would have as plaintiff in a suit brought by it, does not
lay the foundation for the jurisdiction of a Federal court in an action in
equity to enjoin the prosecution of the suit against it.
Equitable jurisdiction does not accrue to the Federal court because it is
thought that the law as administered by it is more favorable to a party
seeking its aid than the law as administered by the courts of a State in
which it has been sued.

This case comes here upon certiorari, applied for by the
petitioner, who was the administratrix of the estate of Herman
D. Cable, deceased. 186 U. S. 482. The suit was brought.
in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern
District of Illinois by complainant, The United States Lifd
Insurance Company, of the city of New York and a citizen of
that State, against Alice A. Cable, a citizen of the State of
Illinois, to have a certain policy of insurance for $50,000, payable as therein stated, upon the life of the said Herman D.
Cable, delivered up for cancellation, on the ground that the
same had been procured by the fraud of the agents of the
deceased. The bill averred that the complainant was an insurance company of New York, lawfully engaged in doing
business throughout the United States, and particularly in
Illinois, under a permit or license duly granted therefor; that
it had issued its policy upon the life of Herman D. Cable, and
that it was procured by the fraud and fraudulent representations of his agents, such fraud and fraudulent representations
being set forth at length; also that defendant had commenced
a suit in the state court of Illinois to recover upon the policy,
which suit was instituted about one and a half hours prior to
the filing of complainant's original bill. A supplemental and
amended bill was filed, in which, among other things, it was
alleged:

Statement of the Case.

191 U. S.

"10. Your orator further avers that the Constitution and
laws of the United States of America confer upon your orator
the right to remove into this court said action at law so begun
against your orator; that, on the other hand, the State of
Illinois, by legislative enactment, has sought to prevent the
removal to this court by insurance companies of actions similar
to said action so begun by said administratrix, and has practically destroyed such right or made its exercise impracticable,
by providing, in substance, that an insurance company shall
forfeit and lose its right to do business in the State of Illinois
upon removing any such action into this court; that by removing said action to this court your orator might lose its
right to transact business in the State of Illinois, and would
certainly become involved in serious controversy with said
•State respecting the transaction of any subsequent business
by your orator in said State; that the laws of said State upon
certain questions of general insurance law, as interpreted by
its highest legal tribunal, and applicable to the facts in this
case, are somewhat different from the laws of the United States
as interpreted by the Federal courts, upon the same questions,
and from the standpoint of the laws of the United States, are
unduly and erroneously adverse to insurance companies; that
your orator is entitled to an application of the law according
to the decisions of the Federal courts; and that under the
facts and circumstances, hereinbefore set forth in this bill,
your orator is without a due and proper remedy at law in
respect to the claim of said administratrix under said policy
of insurance, but is without any remedy at law whatever in
this court."
To this bill the defendant interposed a demurrer, among
other things, for want of equity, and that demurrer was sustained by the Circuit Court but upon appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit the decree sustaining
the demurrer was overruled and the case remanded to the
Circuit Court. 98 Fed. Rep. 761; same case, 39 C. C. A. 264.
An answer was then put in by the administratrix of Cable's

estate denying any fraud, and averring that she had, before
the suit in the Federal court was commenced, herself commenced an action upon the policy in a proper state court of
Illinois, and that it was her intention and desire to push such
action to a speedy conclusion if permitted by the Federal
court.
The suit herein was tried and a decree entered that the policy
was procured on behalf of the deceased by constructive fraud,
and that no actual fraud was intended or practiced in the
delivery of the same, and it was thereupon decreed that the
policy should be delivered up and cancelled. The defendant
appealed from such decree to the Circuit Court of Appeals,
and the complainant took a cross-appeal so as to bring up the
findings of fact as to the constructive fraud, so that, as counsel
said, "the case might be heard and considered in the Circuit
Court of Appeals upon the whole evidence, regardless of the
findings of the master and of the Circuit Court." This was
done for the reason that, in counsel's belief, the evidence
showed a deliberate and intentional concealment on the part
of Lord, the agent of the deceased, and therefore a plain fraud
perpetrated by such agent. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgment and upon application this court granted
the writ of certiorari as stated.
Mr. W. S. Oppenheim, with whom Mr. H. H. C. Miller was
on the brief, for the petitioner:
Where a suit at law is brought against an insurance company
for a loss sustained under an insurance policy, a court of chancery has no jurisdiction to cancel the policy, since every ground
set forth in the bill of complaint can be set up and tried as a
defence in the action at law. § 723, U. S. Rev. Stat. A suit
in equity will not lie to cancel an insurance policy after the
death of the insured. Phwnix Life Ins. Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall.

& C. 475. The respondent had complied with the provisions
of the Illinois Statutes, 2 Hurd's R. S. 1899, ch. 73, by filing
its written application for a license and was regularly authorized to do business within the State of Illinois.
A foreign insurance company has no right to do business
in the State without license and contracts entered into by it
are controlled by the statutes of the State. New York Life
Ins. Co. v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 389.
The statute of the State uader which respondent was licensed does not forbid a removal to the Federal court of suits
brought against it in the state court, but simply reserves the
right to revoke the license issued under the written agreement
given by respondent to the State, if it does not submit its
controversies to the judgment of the state courts and stand
upon the same footing as domestic companies. This statute
is constitutional and the agreement made by the respondent
under which it procured its license is valid and binding. Doyle
v. ContinentalInsurance Co., 94 U. S. 535.
The Circuit Court of the United States cannot enjoin an
action in the state court. Prior to the filing of the bill of complaint an action at law had been instituted against the respondent in the state courts and a summons issued therein
and placed in the hands of the sheriff for service. Under the
law of the State of Illinois jurisdiction attaches by the filing
of a prcecipe and issuance of a summons thereunder. Collins

The disclosure made to the agent of the company was sufficient to put him upon guard and was ample notice to the company of the then condition of Mr. Cable's health and that the
delivery of the policy with such knowledge was a waiver of
its provision concerning the delivery of the same during the
good health of the insured. Phomix Life Insurance Co. v.

Under the facts the remedy at law of respondent is complete
and adequate. The effect of a decree in the present case would
not necessarily be a final adjudication as to the rights of the
parties, should there be a dismissal of the bill. Every defence
had by the insurance company can be made in the suit brought
in the state court. The question then arises whether such a
clear and uncontroverted case of fraud has been made as will
authorize the court to sustain the bill. Southern Development

Mr. William G. Beale, with whom Mr. Buell McKeever, Mr.
Gilbert E. Porterand Mr. CharlesE. Pattersonwere on the brief,
for the respondent:
Whether or not there was a consummated contract on the
21st of February depends, obviously, upon the intent or agreement of the parties. By the application the parties agreed
that the policy should not take effect until delivery; and acceptance by Cable was essential to make a binding delivery.

The application provided that the policy should not take
effect until payment of the first premium, and that only the
president, together with the secretary or the actuary, should
have power to waive any condition of the policy, while the
policy further provided that agents could not modify or change
the contract, of which the application was made a part. There
could be no delivery without payment, for the agent could not
waive the effect of these limitations. Davis v. Mass. Mut.

The equitable jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United
States was properly invoked and exercised, under the special
circumstances of this case, because respondent did not have
a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law as such remedy
is understood in the Federal courts. It could not itself institute any legal proceeding there, nor could it freely remove to
that court any legal proceeding brought against it in the state
court. Its constitutional right to have, through removal, any
controversy at law with petitioner adjudicated in a Federal
court had been hampered, embarrassed, and practically destroyed by an Illinois statute. The remedy at law which is
a bar to equitable relief in a Federal court must exist on the
law side of the same court. Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466, 470;

Doubtless respondent might, upon learning of the action at
law brought against it, have abandoned its bill and removed
the action at law to the Federal court, but that course would
have been fraught with danger, for a controversy with the
state superintendent of insurance, and an attempted revocation of respondent's license, would have been certain to follow.

As respondent did not have the proper remedy at law in the
Federal court, it is immaterial whether respondent had such
a remedy in a state court. The equitable jurisdiction of the
Federal courts does not depend, and cannot be made to depend,
upon the adequacy of proceedings at law in the state courts.

Stanton v. Embry, 46 Connecticut, 595.
Jurisdiction and procedure of the Federal courts cannot be
made to depend upon, nor be controlled by, state legislation and
state procedure; otherwise state legislation, by extending legal

remedies, might destroy all equitable jurisdiction on the part
of Federal courts. The jurisdiction and procedure in the Federal courts of law and of equity depend upon essential principles and distinctions as understood and applied by the Federal
courts themselves. Bean v. Smith, 2 Mason, 252; 2 Fed. Cas.
1143, case 1174; Mayer v. Foulkrod, 4 Wash. Cir. Ct. 349; 16

222; Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, 150 U. S. 202; Smyth V. Ames,
169 U. S. 466, 516.
Nor if that were material did respondent have a plain, adequate and complete remedy in the state courts of Illinois,
because it could not have its controversy with petitioner properly decided there in accordance with correct principles of
general insurance law as understood and applied by this court,
and because it might not have been able to interpose in an
action at law the defence that the policy had been procured
by fraud. This shows the peculiar value of the right to be in
the Federal court. The substantial questions involved are
questions of general law upon which the Federal courts exercise their own judgment, independently of state decisions.

This court must consider its views of the principles of general insurance law to be sound, and any contrary views of other
courts to be erroneous. This court and the Supreme Court of
Illinois appear to differ radically. One or the other must be
wrong, and if the Illinois Supreme Court is wrong, then respondent could have had no remedy at all in the state court
from the standpoint of this court. Bean v. Smith, 2 Mason,
252; 2 Fed. Cas. 1143, 1150, case 1174.

of a life insurance company cannot bind his company, affirmatively or by waiver, through his agreements or knowledge,
when plain and appropriate limitations and restrictions upon
his authority are brought to the attention of an applicant for
insurance by being embodied in the application. Davs v.
Mass. Mut. L. Ins. Co., 13 Blatch. 462; 7 Fed. Cas. 141, case
3642; Painev. Pacific Mut. L. Ins. Co., 2 0. C. A. 459; 51 Fed.

530; Northern Assurance Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Assn., 183
U. S. 308.
The Supreme Court of Illinois holds that any person who
receives applications for life insurance, collects premiums, and
delivers policies is authorized to waive a limitation or restriction upon his own authority contained in a policy or in an
application, and to waive other provisions of the contract, and
to bind the company by agreement or waiver in connection
with the act of manual delivery, without regard to the expressed limitations or restrictions; and that court has expressly
indicated a disinclination to accept the rule enunciated in the
Fletcher case, 117 U. S. 519, and repeated in the Grand View
Bldg. Association case, 183 U. S. 308. John Hancock Mutual
Life Ins. Co. v. SchlinkI, 175 Illinois, 284, 289, 290; Royal Neighbors of America v. Boman, 177 Illinois, 27, 31.
Under a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois
question exists whether the defense of fraud in procuring an
insurance policy, not affecting its manual execution, can be
made available in an action at law, or can only be made available in a suit in equity to cancel the policy. Robinson v. Sharp,
201 Illinois, 86; 66 N. E. Rep. 299. The remedy of respondent
in a state court of Illinois is, therefore, very far from being
"plain" and "adequate" at law.
There had been no final and conclusive election to take the
commuted value of the policy, and the possibility of a multi-

CABLE v. UNITED STATES LIFE INS. CO.

Argument for Respondent.

plicity of suits, or number of successive suits, against respondent for separate annual installments under the policy was
additional ground for invoking the jurisdiction of a court of
equity. Illinois Statutory Provisions concerning the "Administration of Estates," Washington v. L. & N. Ry. Co.,

v. Stone, 88 Fed. Rep. 383, 392; Town of Springport v. Teutonia Say. Bank, 75 N. Y. 397.
Resort to equity was further sustainable on the ground that
respondent might lose important evidence through lapse of
time. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210, 215; Schmidt

Under the circumstances the discretionary jurisdiction of a
court of equity to cancel an instrument obtained by fraud was
properly exercised. 2 Joyce on Insurance, §§ 1674-1680; 2

The power of the Federal court to take jurisdiction of the
case and the propriety of its doing so were not affected by the
commencement of petitioner's action at law in the state court,

after making the foregoing statement
of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
MR. JusTIcF PEcKHm,

It is contended, upon the part of the administratrix of the
estate of the assured, that the court below had no jurisdiction
on the ground that there existed a complete and adequate
remedy (or defence) at law when the company was sued upon
the policy, and that the effect of allowing this jurisdiction in
the Circuit. Court is to improperly deprive the defendant herein
of a trial by jury.
It is conceded by the plaintiff in error that no cause of action
existed in favor of the complainant herein upon the law side
of the Federal court, the contention being that the company
could set up, as a defence to any action brought against it in
the Federal court, those allegations of fraud which, being
proved, would constitute a perfect and complete defence to
any action upon the policy.

CABLE v. UNITED STATES LIFE INS. CO.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The company, however, avers that the administratrix has
elected not to bring her action in the Federal court, although
she might have done so on the gound of diversity of citizenship, but has, instead of so doing, brought it in the state court,
and hence the company would have no opportunity of setting
up its defence in a Federal court in an action brought on the
policy, and it insists that on that account it has not that complete and adequate remedy or defence at law, in the same
jurisdiction, which it contends is necessary in such case.
It is true that the remedy or defence which will oust an
equity court of jurisdiction must be as complete and as adequate, as sufficient and as final, as the remedy in equity, or
else the latter court retains jurisdiction, and it must be a remedy which may be resorted to without impediment created
otherwise than by the act of the party, and the remedy or
defence must be capable of being asserted without renderiug
the party asserting it liable to the imposition of heavy penalties
or forfeitures, arising other than by reason of its own act.
It is also urged, as an answer to the claim of the company,
as to jurisdiction, that even though the remedy or defence at
law must exist in the same (Federal) jurisdiction, yet it is
within the power of the company, if it see fit to do so, to remove
the action in the state court to the Federal court, and thus its
defence at law, while adequate, would also be within the
same jurisdiction in which its suit in equity was commenced.
It is further insisted by the administratrix that it is unnecessary that an action at law should have been commenced in the
same jurisdiction, but it is sufficient that the defence would be
available and complete if such an action should be commenced
in a Federal court of law.
As to the removal of the action from the state to the Federal
court, the company avers that, even assuming it had the right
so to remove, yet it insists that such removal would be too
hazardous to the company by subjecting it to a possible revocation of its license to do business in the State to be of any
adequate avail.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

191 U. S.

It is also argued upon the part of the company that the position of a defendant in an action is not so advantageous as that
of a plaintiff, as the plaintiff has the conduct of a cause largely
within his own control; and it is said that the law as administered in the state court is not so favorable to insurance
companies as is the case in the Federal courts, and that the
company had the right to an administration of the law by the
Federal instead of the state court by reason of the diversity
of citizenship.
These objections are to be considered.
In Hurd's Revised Statutes of Illinois, chap. 73, title "Insurance," in relation to foreign insurance companies, it is
provided: That any such company must first file a written
application for a license, in which it shall state that it desires
to transact the business of insurance, and that it will accept a
license according to the laws of the State, "and that said license
shall cease and terminate in case, andwhenever, it shall remove
or make application to remove into any United States court,
any action or proceeding commenced in any of the state courts,
of this State, upon any claim or cause of action arising out of
any business transaction, in fact, done in this State," etc.
The statute also provides that if any company thereafter
removes or applies to remove into the United States court any
action commenced in a state court of the kind above mentioned, "it is hereby made the imperative duty of the auditor
of public accounts, at once to revoke, cancel and annul the
license issued to such incorporated company, association or
partnership; and thereafter no such incorporated company,
association or partnership shall transact within this State any
business for which it was incorporated until again duly licensed.
In case such revocation of license shall be made because of the
removal of or the attempt to remove any action from a state
court of this State to any United States court no renewal of
such license shall be made within three years after such revocation." Provision is also made that if the license is revoked,
publication of the fact shall be made in the newspapers.

Opinion of the Court.

This court has held that, although there may be power in a
Federal court of equity in a proper case to order the delivery
up and cancellation of a policy of insurance obtained upon
fraudulent representations and suppression of facts, yet it will
not generally do so when those representations and suppressions can be perfectly well established in a defence at law in a
suit upon the policy, and it, therefore, affirmed a decree which
dismissed, without prejudice, a bill filed for obtaining the
delivery up and cancellation of a policy so issued, although the
evidences of the fraud were considerable and a suit on the
policy had been begun in an action at law after the bill in
equity was filed. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616.
That was a suit by the company to obtain the delivery up
and cancellation of certain policies of life insurance after the
death of the assured, on the ground that the policies had been
procured by the defendant, the widow of the deceased, by
fraudulent suppression of material facts, and by the misrepresentation of others of the same class. The answer denied
the allegations made. It was held that the company would
have a perfect defence at law in an action by the holder upon
the policy of insurance, and for that reason equity would refuse
to take jurisdiction of an action to compel the delivery up and
cancellation of the policies. The court said:
"By the death of the cestui que vie the obligation to pay, as
expressed in the policies, became fixed and absolute, subject
only to the condition to give notice and furnish proof of that
event within ninety days. Notice having been given and the
required proof furnished, the obligation to pay certainly became fixed by the terms of the policies and the sums insured
became a purely legal demand, and if so, it is difficult to see
what remedy, more nearly perfect and complete, the appellants can have-than is afforded them by their right to make
defence at law, which secures to them the right of trial by jury.
Where a party, if his theory of the controversy is correct, has
a good defence at law to 'a purely legal demand,' he should be
left to that means of defence, as he has no occasion to resort
voL. cxoi-20

191 U. S.

to a court of equity for relief, unless he is prepared to allege
and prove some special circumstances to show that he may
suffer irreparable injury if he is denied a preventive remedy."
To the same effect are Home Insurance Co. v. Stanchfield, 1
Dillon, 424; Ztna Life Insurance Co. v. Smith, 73 Fed. Rep.
318.
Complainant insists that in this case special -circumstances
are shown that it may suffer irreparable injury if jurisdiction
be denied. Those special circumstances have already been
mentioned and the question is whether they are sufficient to
furnish ground for a Federal court of equity to take jurisdiction herein.
We start with the proposition that, to any action brought
upon the policy in a Federal court, the company would have a
complete and adequate defence by proving the fraud as alleged
in the bill herein. That shows a defence in the same jurisdiction resorted to by the complainant herein. It is answered,
however, that the action has not been commenced in the Federal court, but, on the contrary, the administratrix has commenced her action in the state court, and hence the defence,
if made in the state court, is not in the same jurisdiction as
that in which the bill in this case was filed. But the company
may bring its defence within the same jurisdiction by removing
the case from the state to the Federal court, which it has the
right to do on account of the diversity of citizenship of the
parties thereto. No stipulation or agreement, founded on a
state statute or otherwise, which the company may have entered into could prevent the removal of the case in the exercise
of its constitutional right. This has been so held in Insurance
Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, and that case has been repeatedly
approved. See Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U. S.
535; Barron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186.
In Doyle v. ContinentalInsurance Co., supra, it was held that
a State had the right to impose conditions not in conflict with
the Constitution or the laws of the United States, to the
transaction of business within its territory by a foreign insur-

CABLE v. UNITED STATES LIFE INS. CO.
191 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ance company, and to exclude such company from its territory,
or, having given a license, to revoke it, with or without cause,
and it was further decided that an injunction to restrain a state
officer from revoking and cancelling a license to a foreign company to do business within the State, because the company
has, contrary to the state statute, removed a case from the
state to the Federal court, would not be granted, and it was
remarked that, as the State had the right to exclude a foreign
insurance company, the means by which she caused such exclusion or the motives of her action were not the subject of
judicial inquiry. Whether this case has been shaken by the
subsequent cases of Barron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186, 199;
Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239, 254, and Dayton Coal & Iron
Co. v. Barton, 183 U. S. 23, 25, it is not material here to discuss.
It has from an early day been held that a corporation created
by one State could transact business in another State only with
the consent, expressed or implied, of the latter State, and that
such consent might be accompanied by such conditions as the
latter State might think fit to impose, provided they were not
repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States, or
inconsistent with those rules of public law which secure the
jurisdiction and authority of each State free from encroachment by all others, or that principle of natural justice which
forbids, condemnation without opportunity for defence. Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407; WatersPierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28; New York Life Insurance
Co. v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 389, 401; Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Warren, 181 U. S. 73, 76.
One thing is entirely clear, that the company could have
removed this case from the state to the Federal court, notwithstanding the state statute or anything contained in its
application for a license to do business within the State. Upon
removal the company would have the full and adequate defence under the law as administered by the Federal courts that
it would have in the equity case. Whether, as a result of such
removal, the State would have the right by reason of the stat-

ute to revoke the license given to the company, is not a question which it is necessary for us to here discuss or determine.
But assuming the right of removal, the company says that it
may thereby subject itself to a revocation of its license, or at
least to litigation, to prevent the state authorities from revoking it, and it ought not to be put to any such litigation or
possible injury or inconvenience.
The embarrassment attaching to the complainant herein on
account of a removal, if any, is one of its own creation. As a
condition upon which it was admitted to do business in the
State, it voluntarily signed the application, in which it promised to -accept a license according to the laws of Illinois, and
agreed that the license should terminate in case the company
should remove any action commenced in the state court to the
United States court, as already stated. We think the existence of these facts furnishes no ground for appealing to a
Federal court of equity to take jurisdiction of a suit to cancel
the policy, where otherwise the court would have none. The
state statute could not prevent the removal. If, because of a
removal, ground was furnished for the revocation of the license,
that fact would not justify a resort to a Federal court and
ought not to, because, as we have said already, the contingency is one of the complainant's own creation, and it ought
not, therefore, to be able to avail itself of an embarrassment
which it has voluntarily created, as a foundation for jurisdiction in a Federal court which would not otherwise exist.
It signed its application to do business in order to come into
the State and reap the profits which it thought it might earn
by transacting its business in the State. There was no coercion
upon it to make the application or to take the permit on the
condition stated. Upon the whole, it chose to make such
application and receive the license upon that condition.
If the condition be illegal and no ground for a revocation of
the license, any subsequent litigation which the company may
have by reason of such removal with the state officials to
prevent the revocation of the license on that account is still

CABLE v. UNITED STATES LIFE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

matter caused by its own action, and cannot, in our judgment,
furnish any ground for jurisdiction in the Federal courts.
Still less do we think that any foundation is laid for that
jurisdiction based upon the theory that the company would
not have the same control of the case as a defendant that it
would as plaintiff. That is not the case in modern practice.
The defendant can urge the case'to trial against the desires of
the plaintiff, and its defence may be shown as well and conveniently by a defendant, as the cause of action may be shown
by the plaintiff. The right of the plaintiff to discontinue the
action does not furnish ground for equitable jurisdiction. If
it did, then equity would always have jurisdiction and the
rule would be worthless.
The other ground stated as furnishing a special circumstance
to show that complainant may suffer some irreparable injury
if equity does not take jurisdiction, viz., that the law is more
favorable to insurance companies as administered in the Federal than in the state court, and, therefore, equity ought to
take jurisdiction in this case, upon the ground of the diversity
of citizenship, cannot be regarded for a moment.
It is immaterial whether the assertion be conceded or denied.
It furnishes no ground for equitable jurisdiction in a case like
this. Where a plaintiff in a state court, which has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, brings the defendant properly
within such jurisdiction, he is entitled to a trial of his cause
in that court, unless the case be removed to a Federal court
upon some constitutional ground. If that ground exist, the
removal can be made, but if it do not, equitable jurisdiction
does not accrue to a Federal court because it is thought the
law as administered by that court is more favorable to the
party seeking its aid.
We think that, within the rule in Insurance Co. v. Bailey,
supra, the Circuit Court has no jurisdiction in this case. The
judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and of the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois must, therefore, be reversed, and the case remanded to

HIBBEN v. SMITH.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.
No. 59. Argued November 6, 1903.-Deeided November 30, 1903.
The amount of benefits resulting from an improvement, and assessed under
a state statute which this (ourt has declared to be constitutional is a
question of fact, and a hearing upon it being assumed, the decision of
- the board making the assessment is final and no Federal question arises.
In the apportionment of assessments for improvements due process of law is
afforded to the taxpayer if he is given an opportunity to be heard before
the body making the assessment; and, so far as the Federal Constitution
is concerned, the state legislature may provide that such hearing shall
be conclusive.
Whether a judgment in a state court based on an assessment is void or only
voidable because some of the members of the board were residents of,
and taxpayers in, the assessment district is a proper question for the
state courts to decide, and after the highest court of the State has held
that the judgment is not void and cannot be attacked collaterally, this
court will follow that determination.

THE plaintiff in error seeks by this writ to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, affirming a
judgment in favor of one of the defendants in error, William C.
Smith, foreclosing the lien of an assessment levied upon certain real estate in the town of Irvington, belonging to the
plaintiff in error. The plaintiff Smith brought this action to
foreclose the lien, and alleged in his complaint that he was the
contractor for the doing of the work for a local improvement
on Washington street in the town mentioned, and had complied with all the provisions of the statute and with his con-
