ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
APPEAL

FROM

THE CIRCUIT

COURT

OF THE UNITED

THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF
No. 133.

STATES FOR

ISSOURI.

Argued and submitted January 6, 1891.-Decided May 25,1891.

This suit is brought to determine the legal effect of a will, and of a modifying contract in regard to it made by those interested. As "the whole question in the case is one of fact," the court has "given the evidence a very
careful examination," and, without determining the legal effect of the
will or the contract, and proceeding on the real intention of the parties,
which were fair to all interested, and have been acted upon and acquiesced in by every one concerned for a long period, and deeming it for
the interest of all concerned and of the community that litigation over
this estate should cease, it makes a decree to effect those objects.

This was a suit in equity brought by Mollie N. Albright

and David K. Oyster in his own right, citizens of Missouri,
against George Oyster, Margaret Oyster, Margaretta Oyster,
executrix of the last will and testament of Simon Oyster, de-

ceased, Simon K. Oyster and Iola E. Oyster, his wife, and John
Albright, husband of Mollie N. Albright, citizens of Pennsylvania. Its object was to establish the title of the plaintiffs to.
a large amount of land situated in Lewis County, MNissouri,
the legal title to which was in the defendant George Oyster.
The controversy grows out of a will made by Abraham
Oyster, and a subsequent agreement in writing among the
parties to this suit, who were beneficiaries under the will.
The plaintiffs Mollie N. Albright and William E. Oyster and
the defendant Iola E. Oyster are the children of the plaintiff
David K. Oyster.
Abraham Oyster died in Lewis County, Missouri, on the
10th day of August, 1862, leaving four children, viz., the plaintiff David K. Oyster, the defendants Margaret and George
Oyster, and Simon Oyster, since deceased. He left a will
dated two days before his death, and duly probated in the
county court of Lewis County, Missouri, on the 21st of October, 1862, which was as follows
"Itis my will that all my real estate, part of which is situate in Cumberland County, State of Pennsylvania, a part in
Pike County, State of Illinois, and a part in Lewis and Marion
counties, in the State of Missouri - Island No. 14, in the Mississippi, opposite the city of La Grange, is not included in this
clause -be taken possession of as soon as may be by the executors of this will, and that all such parts thereof as can shall
be leased or rented until such time as, in the judgment of said
executors, it will sell for fair prices, when they will proceed to
sell said real estate to the best advantage, all of which they
are hereby authorized to bargain, sell and alien in fee simple,
and out of the proceeds of such sale and rents " 1. I hereby give and bequeath to my daughter, Martha
Oyster, ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
"2. I give and bequeath to my son, George Oyster, ten
thousand dollars ($10,000).
"3. Of the remainder of the proceeds of the sales and rents
aforesaid I give and bequeath to my sons, Simon Oyster,
George Oyster and David K. Oyster, and my daughter,
Martha Oyster, each -an equal portion, but it is my will that

Opinion of the Court.

the portion that falls to my son David K. Oyster my executors
shall so dispose of as that only the interest annually shall be
paid to him, also that the saw-mill in the city of La.Grange
shall, until such time as my executors shall deem it proper to
sell it, as the other real estate, be rented to my son David K.
at a fair sum, or to some other person.
"Also that my executors collect all the debts owing to me,
and out of such collections pay all the expenses of the executorship, including all fees, etc.
"I do hereby appoint as executors of this will my son
George Oyster and my son-in-law Charles Oyster, both of the
county of Cumberland, and State of Pennsylvania."
-MarthaOyster mentioned in the will is known as .Margaret
Oyster throughout these proceedings.
The bill of complaint in this case was filed on the 6th of
September, 1883, and, after setting out the foregoing facts in
somewhat the same order as we have stated them, contained
substantially the following material averments
In consequence of the executors named in the will not residing in
Missouri, they were disqualified to act, under the laws of that
State, and on the day the will was probated the court appointed
David K. Oyster administrator of the estate of Abraham
Oyster, deceased, with the will annexed, and he duly qualified
as such administrator. Simon Oyster and David K. Oyster
were not satisfied with the provisions of the will, and, on the
18th of April, 1866, the former instituted a suit in the Circuit
Court of Lewis County, Missouri, to have it set aside and
declared null and void. While that suit was pending Simon
Oyster died, leaving a will in which he appointed his wife
Margaretta his sole executrix, with full power to settle up his
estate. That will was duly probated in the orphans' court of
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and the executrix took upon
herself the execution of it.
On the 3d of March, 1868, the legatees under the will, then
living, and Margaretta Oyster, executrix, etc., as a sort of compromise of the suit instituted by Simon Oyster, as aforesaid,
entered into an agreement in writing, drawn by George Oyster,
by the terms of which it was provided that, for the purpose of

OCTOBER TERMr, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

effecting a speedy settlement of said estate, Margaretta Oyster,
executrix, etc., and David K. Oyster should pay to Margaret
and George Oyster the sum of $5000, in equal parts of $2500
to each, and that, in ,consideration of certain advances made
to Simon, George and Margaret Oyster, by their father, Abraham, during his lifetime, and in order to nearly equalize the
shares of the several legatees, the plaintiff David K. Oyster,
should receive from the estate (1) 640 acres of unimproved
lands in Lewis County, Missouri, (2) 320 acres of land in Pike
County, Illinois, (3) certain particularly described property in
La Grange, Missouri, on which steam saw-mills were built, in
consideration of $1125, and (4:) $5000. The agreement further provided that, in consideration of the foregoing parts of
it being fully complied with, the remainder of the estate of
their ancestor should be divided equally among George, Margaret, David K. and the heirs of Simon Oyster; and that,
except as to the bequests made to Margaret and George Oyster
of $10,000 each, and as to so much as related to the saw-mill
property at La Grange, the will of Abraham Oyster should
be fully executed. And it was further agreed that, in consideration of the above premises, the suit to contest the will,
brought by Simon Oyster, should be forever abandoned.
In pursuance of that agreement, on the 13th of April, 1868,
the suit instituted by Simon Oyster to have the will set aside
was dismissed. Afterwards, in November, 1869, the lands belonging to the estate in Missouri were sold at public auction.
A few days before the sale, George, Margaret, Margaretta,
executrix, etc., and David K. Oyster held a consultation, at
the residence of David K., as to the best method of carrying
out the provisions of the will and the subsequent agreement,
at which time it was fully agreed by all of them that at the
forthcoming sale David K. should bid in for the benefit of his
children what was then known as the "home farm" of Abraham Oyster, for $12,000, and also 640 acres of land in what
was known as "Oyster prairie," in Lewis County, in order
that they (his children) might be made to share equally, in the
distribution of the estate, with the other legatees who had
received advancements from Abraham Oyster during his life-

ALiBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

time. It was found, however, that David K, being administrator with the will annexed, was precluded, under the laws
of Missouri, from bidding at the sale, and, accordingly,
arrangements satisfactory to all concerned were finally made
by which David K. relinquished all right, title, claim and
interest in and to the property under the will and the subsequent modifying agreement, for the benefit of his children, and
Simon K. Oyster, the son of M argaret, and the son-in-law of
David K., bid in those two last-mentioned pieces of property
-the former for $12,000 and the latter for $3200-for the
benefit of the children of David K.
After a few other tracts of prairie land had been sold at
what seemed to those interested to be unsatisfactory prices,
an understanding was reached among the legatees under the
will that the remainder of the prairie lands should be sold and
bought in by any one of them without regard to price or location, and, in order that such property might be equally divided
among them, it was further agreed that three appraisers should
be appointed to go with the county surveyor upon those prairie
lands and divide them into four equal parts. The sale then
proceeded to completion, and the purchasers at the sale received
their deeds from David TK., as administrator. Afterwards,
in pursuance of the agreement last above referred to, three
appraisers were appointed, who made division of the prairie
lands bought in by the legatees under the will in four equal
parts, as nearly as was possible according to their value.
Thereupon, by virtue of a mutual agreement between the
beneficiaries under the will, they selected their respective portions of the lands divided as aforesaid in the following order
(1)CGeorge Oyster, (2) Margaret Oyster, (3) Margaretta Oyster, executrix, etc., and (4) Simon K. Oyster, for the benefit
of
4
the children of David K. Oyster. Accordingly deeds were
made to each one of them by David K., as administrator,
including absolute deeds to Simon K. of the two first-mentioned properties and the last division of the prairie land. In
making conveyances the prairie land property was treated as
if it had been bid in at the administrator's sale. The grantees
in those conveyances thereupon took possession of the property

Opinion of the Court.

conveyed to them, respectively, and continued to hold it ever
afterwards.
Subsequently, on the 11th of September, 1871, the Circuit
Court of Lewis County, Missouri, appointed one Robinson
trustee for the children of David K., to take the property
purchased at the sale and that set aside by the appraisers
for the benefit of those children, and authorized him to receive
said property at the prices at which it had been bid in by
Simon K., as aforesaid. The trustee made demand therefor
of Simon K., but the latter, acting under the influence of the
defendant George Oyster, declined to make such transfer; and
soon thereafter the trustee died without having begun any
proceedings to compel such conveyance.
The deeds to Simon K., although absolute in form and purporting to have been executed in consideration of $21,000,
were taken by Simon K. with the distinct understanding that
he should hold the property as the trustee for the benefit of
the children of David K., and no consideration whatever was
paid by him, all of which facts were well known to all the
beneficiaries of the estate. But, nevertheless, on the 10th day
of February, 1881, Simon K., with full knowledge of all the
facts in the premises, and in violation of the trust reposed in
him, in consideration of the sum of five dollars, (which was
never paid,) conveyed the property deeded to him as aforesaid
to the defendant George Oyster, who also had full knowledge
of all those facts and circumstances relative to said trust, and
who, in fact, was mainly instrumental in procuring such conveyance to himself, by representing to Simon K., who was
then very sick, that if he should die it would involve his estate
in much litigation, and that he (George) would indemnify him
(Simon K.) against any loss which he might suffer by reason
of such conveyance.
At.the time of the partition and sale aforesaid the children of
David K. were all minors and unmarried. But subsequently the
daughter, Iola E., intermarried with said Simon K., and moved
to Pennsylvania. The other daughter married the defendant
John Albright, but both she and her brother, William E.,
have always lived with their father, who had been in posses-

Opinion of the Court.

sion and enjoyment of the lands so conveyed to Simon K. ever
since that conveyance, with the consent of his children, holding
the same for their benefit.
Soon after the defendant George Oyster got the legal title
to the lands in question, he instituted a suit in ejectment
against David K., which, under a stipulation between the
parties to that suit, resulted in a judgment of ouster against
David K. on the 30th of April, 1883. At the same time the
plaintiff in that suit agreed not to cause execution to issue on
his judgment before the 1st of May, 1884, in order that the
plaintiffs in this suit might have time to file this bill, to test
their equitable rights to the property in dispute.
The bill further stated that the reason the plaintiff Mrollie
N. Albright appeared by her next friend, and her husband,
John Albright, was made a defendant, was because they did
not live together, and he refused to join as a coplamntiff with
her; and that the reason Iola E. Oyster was not made a
coplaintiff was because she was under the influence and
control of her husband, Simon K., who refused to join as a
coplaintiff in this suit.
The prayer of the bill was for an injunction to restrain the
defendant George Oyster from causing execution to issue on
the aforesaid judgment in the ejectment proceedings, and for
a decree directing him to convey the property in dispute to
the plaintiffs and the defendant Iola E. Oyster, on the ground
thaV the conveyance of the property to Simon K. Oyster was
made in trust for their use and benefit, that it had been fully
paid for out of David K. Oyster's distributive share of the
estate of his father, and that the defendant George Oyster
acquired the property, with knowledge of the trust, and
parted with no value therefor, and for other and further
relief, etc.
George Oyster filed an answer to the bill, and the main
issues in the case arise out of the bill and that answer. It
was in substance as follows It admitted all the averments
contained in the bill up to and including the making of the
agreement of March 3, 1868, modifying the terms of the will,
and averred in relation to that matter that the respondent

500

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

had never refused to be bound by that agreement, but that
plaintiff David K. had persistently ignored the obligations
which that instrument imposed upon him, although he had
been quite willing to accept the benefits which it conferred.
It further admitted the main facts in relation to the sale of
the property by the administrator to ber substantially as stated
in the bill, but averred that the real agreement entered into
by the legatees under the will, with respect to the purchase
of certain of the lands by the legatees and their subsequent
partition, was this That the share of each legatee, as ascertained by the partition proceedings mentioned in the bill,
should be paid for by each one, respectively, and the prices
therefor should be treated as assets of the estate, to be disposed
of by the administrator in the proper execution of the will and
the modifying contract.
The answer then averred that, at the sale, property to the
value of $4920 was sold to strangers, and the remainder of it
was bid in by the four legatees or by some one in their interest under the agreement, that the sale having been concluded,
the four legatees under the will met and mutually agreed upon
the division that should be made of the property bid in by
them, whereby $3500 worth of lands fell to each respondent,
Margaret and Alargaretta, executrix, etc., and $6000 worth
to them jointly, (none of which are in dispute,) and all the
remainder of the property, that in dispute, was apportioned to
David K. for $21,800, that all of that property was to be
accounted for by them respectively, according to its amount
and value, that, as the property apportioned to David K. was
more than his share under the will and the modifying agreement, it was agreed that the title to that property should
remain in the estate until paid for by him, and be chargeable
with the purchase money, that the deeds were made in pursuance of that agreement or understanding, that respondent,
Margaret and Mlargaretta, executrix, etc., each paid to the
administrator the price of the lands allotted to them respectively, but that the purchase price of the land conveyed by
Simon K. was not paid by him, by David K., or by any one
else, that David K., as administrator, was chargeable with

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

the purchase price of the land conveyed to Simon K., and
with $4920 purchase money of land sold to strangers, and with
other property which came into his hands, the precise amount
of which was unknown to respondent, and that David K., in
making the conveyances to Simon K. without payment of the
purchase price, acted in violation of his official duty, and the
conveyance thus operated to invest Simon K. with the title to
the property thus conveyed, subject to the incumbrance for
purchase money, and to constitute him a trustee of said property for the legatees under the will for their respective shares
in the estate of the testator remaining unsatisfied, viz., to
respondent, $1975, to Margaret, $2887, and to Margaretta,
executrix, etc., $5230.
It was denied that the "house farm" and the 640 acres of
prairie lands, or either of them, was bid in for the benefit of
the children of David K., or that Simon K. ever held said
lands upon any trust whatever for said children. It was then
averred that the alleged trust in Simon K. was void under the
Missouri statute of frauds, because it was not in writing.
Further answering, respondent admitted that Simon K. never
paid any consideration for the property in dispute, and averred
that neither did the plaintiffs, who claim to be his cestuis que
trust, ever pay any consideration therefor, and that plaintiffs
should be estopped from averring the consideration in the deed
to Simon K. to have been other than that stated in the deed.
The conveyance of Simon K. to respondent was admitted,
but it was denied that any unfair means were adopted by
respondent as an inducement to that conveyance. And it was
further averred that the conveyance was taken by respondent,
not for his sole use and benefit, as alleged in the bill, but in
trust for the benefit of the legatees under the will, as the only
means of securing the amounts due from David K. to the other
legatees, David K. and his sureties on his official bond being
wholly insolvent, that all acts done by respondent since he
secured the title to the property were likewise in the execution
of said trust, and that respondent is still claiming to hold the
property in trust as aforesaid.
Without going more into detail, it is sufficient to say that

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

any and all other material averments in the bill charging the
respondent with any illegal practices or any wrong were specifically denied by him, as was also the averment that respondent was holding the property in trust for the children of
David K., and it was prayed that the bill be dismissed.
Margaret Oyster and Margaretta Oyster, executrix, etc.,
filed separate demurrers to the bill on the ground that it did
not allege that those defendants had any interest in the lands
mentioned in the bill adverse to plaintiffs, or that those defendants did in any way controvert or deny, or had in any
way controverted or denied, the rights of plaintiffs to the relief demanded, or that those defendants- were in any way interested or concerned in the granting or refusal of the relief
demanded, and because no case was stated which entitled
plaintiffs to any discovery or relief against those defendants.
Iola E. Oyster filed a disclaimer, and Simon K. filed a plea
that the trust alleged to have been in him was not in writing,
and was, therefore, void under the laws of Missouri.
The plaintiffs filed exceptions to that part of the answer of
George Oyster which set up the statute of Missouri to defeat
the trust, and also to the plea of Simon K. Oyster setting up
the same defence, on the grounds (1) that the facts alleged
in the bill took the case out of the operation of the statute,
(2) that there had been a part performance which took the
case out of the operation of the statute, and (3) because the
alleged trust was a resulting trust.
On the 31st of January, 1884, the court entered an order
overruling the demurrers of Margaret and Margaretta Oyster,
sustaining the excep ions to the plea of Simon K. and the first
exception to the answer of George Oyster, overruling the
other exceptions to the answer, and giving the defendant
Simon K. leave to answer in twenty days. The opinion of
the court on these points, delivered by Judge Treat, is found
in 19 Fed. Rep. 849.
On the 4th of February, 1884, the plaintiffs filed a reply to
the answer of George Oyster, and on the 18th of the same
month Simon K. Oyster filed an answer to the bill, in which
he admitted many of the facts alleged in the bill, among

ALBRIGHT .v. 0 YSTER.
Opimon of the Court.

others that he never paid any of the consideration named
in the deed to him, and averred that it was never expected
of him that he should pay it, but, on the contrary, it was understood that David K. should pay it. He further admitted
that he conveyed the property in dispute to the defendant
George Oyster, but denied that he violated any trust in so
doing, and further denied any confederacy or any intention on
his part to commit any wrongful acts, in the transaction, or to
violate any trust reposed in him.
Replication was also filed to this answer; and the case being
thus at issue a considerable amount of testimony was taken. The
case was heard upon the pleadings and proofs, and arguments
of counsel, and on the first of December, 1884, the Circuit
Court entered a decree dismissing the bill of complaint, without prejudice to any rights that the parties might have in
the final administration of the trusts which were found to
have devolved on the defendant George Oyster, by the deed
from Simon K. and the aforesaid contract of March 3, 1868,
modifying the will of Abraham Oyster, deceased. The opinion of the court, delivered by Judge Treat, is found in 22 Fed.
Rep. 628. An appeal from that decree brings the case here.
The theory upon which this suit is prosecuted is, that the
complainants are the owners in equity of the real estate described in the bill, the consideration for it having been paid by
the distributive share of the complainant David K. Oyster, in
his father's estate, that part of the property described was bid
off at the sale in 1869 by Simon K. Oyster, for the benefit of
the children of David K., and the remainder, which was the
one-fourth part of the lands in Oyster prairie set apart as the
share of David K., was bid off at the sale by the heirs, that
all that property was deeded to Simon K., as trustee for David
I. and his children, the conveyance not proceeding directly to
the beneficiaries, because, under the law of Missouri, David .,
being administrator of the estate, could not convey to himself
individually, and his children at that time were minors, and
that the conveyance of the property by Simon K. to the defendant George Oyster was charged with those trusts. The
real defence of George Oyster is, that David K. Oyster was in

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

arrears to the estate in a large sum, and for that reason his
share in the estate of their father was conveyed to Simon K.,
as trustee, charged with that sum, and that he himself now
holds the property, by conveyance from Simon K., charged
with the lien of himself, Margaret and Margaretta, executrix
of Simon, deceased, for the unpaid portion of the purchase
price from David K. The court below found that the evidence did not sustain complainant's theory of the case, and
accordingly dismissed the bill without prejudice to the rights
of the parties in the final administration of the trust devolved
upon George Oyster by the deed to him from Simon K., and
under the contract of March 3, 1868, amendatory of the will
of Abraham Oyster.
As the whole question in the case is one of fact, we have
given the evidence a very careful examination. Certain facts
are undisputed, or are clearly proven. Abraham Oyster died
testate in Missouri in 1862, leaving a large amount of property
in that State, in Illinois and in Pennsylvania. He left four
children surviving him, Margaret, Simon, George and David
K. A few years before his death he had made certain advancements to Margaret, George and Simon, but had advanced
nothing to David K. By his will he made further preferences in favor of George and Margaret, bequeathing to them
$10,000 apiece, and then dividing the remainder of the estate
equally among the four children. The clause in the will relating to the share of David K. was worded somewhat peculiarly,
as follows "It is my will that the portion that falls to my
son, David K. Oyster, my executors shall so dispose of as
that only the interest annually shall be paid to him." We
need not stop here to consider the legal effect of that clause.
But the evidence clearly shows that, until a very recent period,
the understanding of all the legatees was, that it conveyed
to David K. only a life estate in the share coming to him,
with a remainder over to his children. The foregoing facts
are thus stated in the forefront of the opinion, because upon
them hinges much that is to follow
As is usual when there has been an unequal division of an
estate among the children of the testator, those receiving the

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

smaller shares were dissatisfied with the will. Accordingly,
we find Simon Oyster bringing a suit to set the will aside and
have it declared null and void. Before that suit was terminated Simon Oyster died, leaving a will by which he appointed his widow (who was also named Margaret and who
]
is the " Margaretta"
throughout these proceedings-so called
because she was small of stature, and to distinguish her from
the other Margaret) executrix of his estate. Throughout the
subsequent transactions relating to the estate of Abraham
Oyster, Margaretta represented the share that fell to Simon.
To all intents and purposes she was treated by the other
legatees as the legal representative of Simon, and has been so
treated by them up to this time.
The unequal distribution of the estate of Abraham Oyster
by his will and the suit of Simon to set it aside brought about
the agreement in writing of March 3, 1868, amendatory of the
will. The object of that agreement was to place the children
of Abraham Oyster on a comparatively equal footing respecting the estate, and to compromise the suit of Simon, for the
understanding of the parties was, that that suit did not abate
by his death. That agreement is as averred in complainant's
bill, but to make its terms fully understood it may be necessary to advert to certain facts brought out by the evidence.
As already stated, Abraham Oyster, in his lifetime, had made
advancements to Margaret, Simon and George, but had never
advanced anything to David K. Those advancements appear
to have been made in the years 1858 or 1859. Accordingly,
the first consideration moving in the agreement was to place
David K. on a comparatively equal footing with his brothers
and sister. The agreement, therefore, provided that Margaret,
0 argaretta, executrix, and George, should quitclaim their
interests to David K. in the following property belonging to
the estate (1) Six hundred and forty acres of unimproved
land in Lewis County, Missouri (known as a portion of the
"Oyster prairie" lands, in the subsequent proceedings), and
(2) three hundred and twenty acres of land in Pike County,
Illinois. Certain particularly described property in La Grange,
Missouri, known as the "saw-mill" property, was to be sold

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opmion of the Court.

to David K. for $1125, and he was to receive further the
sum of $5000 out of the estate. In consideration of this
equalization of the shares in the estate, Margaret and George
still retained a slight advantage over the other two heirs.
True, they relinquished the bequests of $10,000 made to each
of them by the will of their father, but it was part of the
agreement that they were each to receive from David K. and
Margaretta, executrix, etc., $2500, or $1250 apiece from each
of them. By the terms of the agreement the will, as thus
modified, was to be carried out. That is, the other property
of the estate was to be sold and the proceeds divided equally
among the four legatees.
Regarding subsequent events in the distribution of the
estate, there is some dispute. But we think the evidence,
fairly and reasonably considered, warrants us in finding the
following- As before stated, George Oyster was one of the
executors of his father's will. In the management and settling up of his father's estate in Illinois and Pennsylvania he
had full and absolute control. He was the leading spirit of
the family, and, in the matter of the estate, whatever was
said or done by him was acquiesced in by his sister Margaret
and his sister-in-law Margaretta. He conceived the idea,
either originally or after taking the advice of counsel, that the
agreement of March 3, 1868, was not valid and binding upon
the parties to it, for the reason that Margaretta, as executrix,
had no power to make any agreement or conveyance that
would be binding upon minor heirs. Accordingly, while the
subsequent proceedings in the settlement of the estate were
carried out on the basis of the equality of interests represented
by the contract of March 3, 1868, the proceedings authorized
by that contract were not adhered to. No quit-claim deeds
were made to David K. for the 320 acres of land in Illinois,
or the 640 acres in Lewis County, Missouri, nor did David K.
receive the $5000 from the estate, according to the terms of
the contract. But an oral agreement was reached at some
time after the date of the contract and prior to the 15th of
November, 1869, (the precise date not being readily ascertainable, nor is it material,) by which the interest of David K. in

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

the estate in Illinois and Pennsylvania was to be concentrated
in what was known as the "home farm" of Abraham Oyster,
(at that time and since the residence of David K.), and at the
forthcoming sale on said 15th of November, 1869, David K.
was to bid it in for $12,000. The other property mentioned
in the agreement of March 3, 1868, that was to go to David
X., was also to be bid in by him at that sale. This arrangement was made because it was believed by the beneficiaries
under the will that David K.'s share of the estate could not
be paid to him in money under the clause of the will above
quoted, but might be put into real estate for his benefit during
his lifetime with a remainder over to his children, and for the
further reason that it was doubted if any conveyance could
be made to David K. by the other legatees that would bind
the minor heirs of David K. and of Simon, especially by
Margaretta, as executrix. This theory harmonizes best with
all the testimony in the case, and is borne out by a letter of
George Oyster to David K., dated at his Pennsylvania home,
June 11, 1868, wherein, after referring to the condition of
affairs in relation to the estate, and particularly to the manner in which he understood the distribution should be made
by David 1K. in the settlement of it, he says
' Simon having brought an action to test the validity of
Father's will, His Executrix is a Legal party to the articles of
Agreement we have Entered into, having made his objection
in said suit a part of the consideration upon which our agreement was based whereby his Executrix represents all the
interest that Simon has or may have had to any and all Interest arising to Simon of Father's Estate, in the property contained or embraced in said agreement.
"The minor or other children of Simon are all represented
By Simons Executrix and when you, as administrator of
Fathers Estate, proceed under an order of sale from the court
in pursuance of Father will, you are the proper party to sell
and make all the titles for all the property Belonging to said
Estate and after having done so and received the proceeds
arising from such sale and you make or are ready to make
Distribution of the same that Simon Executrix on receiving

Opinion of the Court.

his share or Interest arising therefrom that her release to you
will be all that will be necessary to forever exclude any and
all heirs of Simon from any further claim. Such is certainly
the law here She having her Letters Testamentary Issued
here. Now the only question that presents itself to my mind
is whether the Laws of your state will recognize acts legally
done by her here as of the same force and effect there, if not,
then her signature and acknowledgment to the agreement can
be of no value and the whole agreement become void, as it
was not the intention of any of the parties to it at the time of
making it that it should be confined in its effect to the property in this state, and in regard to the farm on which you
live You will best make Title to some other person who will
return the title to-you, or have title through an order of the
court. I am of the Opinion that Simon's Executrix would not
be vested with power to join us in making title to you for
property there that would exclude the minor children fromi
claiming thereafter. I hold that the power to become a competent party to the agreement by which real Estate is disposed
of arose from Simon's own act in filing Exceptions to the
manner in which Father disposed of his property m which he
was interested in the final Distribution and that in the Balance of the property she is not legally qualified to do anything
more than receive the share due Simon and release the Executors and Administrators therefrom.
"In making or having title made to the farm you should
have it made so that the trust vested in the executors by
father can be discharged and all your interest in the moneys
arising from the sales of real estate can be invested in that
property in pursuance of the will, otherwise the interest arising out of this property here would have to continue in the
possession of the executor as trustee which is not desirable. I
wish it so arranged that your shares shall be vested in that
farm and the trust closed m it."
The sale of the property was made by David K. as administrator, as advertised, on the 15th of November, 1869. For
the purpose of making plain the facts connected with that
sale we will divide the lands sold into eight parcels, following

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

m this respect the division made by counsel for appellees, viz..
(1) Lands sold to strangers; (2) certain property in La Grange,
(3) the saw-mill property in La Grange, (4) the 640-acre tract
m Lewis County, Missouri, which, under the contract of March
3, 1868, was to be quit-claimed to David K., (5) the "home
farm," (6) about 40 acres five or six miles southeast of La
Grange, known as the "Durgin Creek property," (7) about
45 acres of land near La Grange, or as it is frequently designated, "the tract back of town," and (8) prairie lands and
timber lands, unimproved, aggregating about 2200 acres. It
may be well to state here, also, that the property in dispute
comprises parcels 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, and the one-fourth part of
parcel 8.
It was found, however, that, under the laws of Missouri,
David K. could not bid in any property at the sale, because
he was the administrator of the property to be sold. Without
going into the details of the transactions on the day of the
sale, or referring particularly to all of the evidence upon
which our judgment is based, it is sufficient to say that, in our
opinion, the evidence, fairly and reasonably considered, shows
that Simon :K. Oyster was selected, and mutually agreed upon
by all parties in interest, to represent the share of David K.
in the bidding in of the property which had been selected for
that share. Under that arrangement Simon K. bid in parcels
3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, as above designated. Parcel 4 was bid in at
$5 per acre, $3200, but, in reality, it matters nothing what
the price of it was, for it was purely ajpro forma proceeding
for the purpose of ultimately passing the title to it to David
K.'s share, in pursuance of the agreement for the equalization
of the shares that was, at that time, being carried out in
apparent good faith. That parcel, as was also parcel 3, was
bid in by Simon X., as trustee for the share of. David K., to
effectuate the same purpose as was originally intended to be
accomplished by quit-claim deeds which were contemplated by
the agreement of March 3, 1868, and this proceeding was
adopted in preference to quit-claim deeds from the other legatees, as being safer and in accordance with the law, as the parties then understood it, as already stated. We say, therefore,

OCTOBER TERS, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

that, according to our view of the evidence, parcel 4 was to,
be conveyed to David K. to assist in making his share of the
estate equal to those of the other legatees, and that, in that
view of the case, the price bid for the land was immaterial,
inasmuch as that tract of land was regarded as being fully
paid for by David K.'s share.
Parcel 3 was to be paid for at the price stated in the agreement of March 3, 1868, to wit, $1125, and in the final settlement of the estate that sum was to be charged against the
share of David K.
Parcel 2 was bid in for the benefit of George, Margaret and
Margaretta, executrix, etc., and was to be accounted for by
them at $6000. To equalize David K.'s share with that transaction, it was to receive parcels 6 and 7. Parcel 6, known as
the "Durgin Creek property," was valued at $10 per acre, or
$400, and parcel 7 at $35 per acre, or $1575-$1975 for
both tracts, or practically equal to one-third of the value of
parcel 2.
Parcel 1, as we have stated, represents land sold to various
persons other than the legatees. The amount realized from
the sale of those parcels was $4920. It was found, however,
during the progress of the sale, that the land was not bringing
what the heirs thought it ought to bring. Accordingly, it
was arranged that any tract which should not sell for about
its full value should be bid in by one or the other of the heirs,
it mattered not which, for the benefit of all, and that at the
conclusion of the sale the lands thus bought m should be
divided into four parcels, as nearly equal in value as could be
ascertained.
That arrangement was carried out, the remainder of the
lands, aggregating about 2200 acres (parcel 8), were bought
in promiscuo.usly by the heirs, and they were afterwards
divided into four equal parts, according to their value, by
three appraisers and a surveyor appointed by the heirs. One
of those parts was selected by Margaret, another by Margaretta, executrix, a third by George, and the fourth was left
for the share of David K. Deeds were made by David K., as
administrator, to Margaret, Margaretta and George for their

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

respective parts of those lands. The other part, allotted to
the share of David K., was included in the deed from David
K., as administrator, to Simon K., trustee for David K.'s
share. Thus, the sale and division of the lands belonging
to the estate were completed. We have said that we would
not refer particularly to all of the evidence in the case
bearing upon this sale and division of the property One
part of it we desire to speak of; viz., a letter from George
Oyster, dated at La Grange, Missouri, November 20, 1869,
(five days after the sale,) addressed to his daughter, Annette,
at their home in Pennsylvania. In this letter he speaks particularly of the transactions relating to the sale and division of
the property, saying, among other things. the following" "On
Monday last was the sale. We went to Monticello and commenced selling about 11 o'clock. The farm at the river was
sold first, or rather knocked down, at $12,000. There was no
stranger bid on it. We sold near $5000 worth of Lands all
below what they are worth, 3 pieces of 80 Acres Each Brought
$14.75 & 15$ per acre, I have since Been told were worth 18
to 20$ per acre. I think the Balance was knocked down at
prices running from 4$ to 13.50. There was 2300 Acres sold
besides what David had selected which sold at $5 per acre
(640 acres) and 400 acres we sold strangers, we have this
morning agreed on the Balance of the Property unsold, we
have agreed to Divide the prairie and timber Lands Equally by
having 3 men to divide it for us, and the property at the river.
David gets the Farm at $12,000 and 45 Acres of Land at 358
per acre and 40 Acres timber land 8 miles from From LaGrange
at $10 per acre, and Margaret, Simon's Wife and me take the
town property at $6000 and we pay David $200 for his share
of some shops on the lots. The arrangement is satisfactory to
all of us and I think will change this Estate from a sinking
fund to supporting itself."
This letter, written about the time the transactions to which
it refers occurred, is of vastly more value, as evidence, than the
statements of witnesses as to the same occurrences made many
years afterwards, when differences had arisen and their minds
were more or less prejudiced in favor of their own interests.

OCTOBER TERAi,

1890.

Opinion of the Court.

Moreover, it is in. entire accord with the evidence introduced
by David K., many of whose witnesses had been familiar with
the' transactions concerning which they testified, and were
apparently representative men in the community where those
transactions occurred. Some of them had purchased land at
the sale in November, 1869, and most of them had been at that
sale and saw what was taking place. :Nor is their evidence
contradicted materially by Margaret Oyster, one of the defendants herein, who, though not remembering very many
things connected with the transaction very definitely, testified
that she "always thought David should have the 'home
farm, )" and that on the way home from the sale she heard
David say he wanted that farm for his children. Indeed, the
general effect of the testimony in support of the conclusion at
which we have arrived, on this point, is not shaken by any
evidence in the record, either oral or documentary, and George
Oyster himself, unconsciously, perhaps, corroborates it in his
testimony
Upon this branch of the case, therefore, we say, that our
conclusion is in accordance with complainant's theory of the
case. We think there can be no reasonable doubt but that
parcels 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7,as above designated, were bought in
at the sale by Simon K. Oyster, as trustee for the share of
David K., that parcel 4 went to David K.'s share of the
estate towards equalizing that share with the shares of the
other heirs who had received advancements for more than
that amount a few years before the death of Abraham Oyster,
and was, therefore, fully paid for, that parcels 5 and 6 went
to David K.'s share, while parcel 2 went to Margaret, Margaretta, executrix, and George, thus practically equalizing the
shares in those transactions, that parcels 3 and 5 were bought
in for the benefit of David K.'s share -the
former at $1125
and the latter at $12,000, and that parcel 8 was equally
divided among the heirs, according to its value. With respect,
then, to parcels 4, 6, '7and the one-fourth part of parcel 8, we
think the evidence shows that they have been fully paid for
by David K.'s interest in the estate of his father, in accordance
with the will and the subsequent modifying agreements, that

AIBRIGRT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

Simon K. took a deed for them as trustee for the interest of
David K., and that the transfer of those tracts from Simon
K. to George was charged with the same trust.
With respect to parcels 3 and 5, that is, the "saw-mill property" and the "home farm," we are equally clear that they
were bid off by Simon K. Oyster for the benefit of the share
of David K., were deeded to him as such, and were conveyed
by him to the defendant George Oyster charged with that
trust. The only difficulty on this point is as to whether the
consideration for those two pieces of property was fully paid
by the interest of David K. in his father's estate.
As already stated, those two pieces of property were to be
paid for at $1125 and $12,000 or $13,125. Under the agreement modifying the will, however, David K. was to receive
$5000 cash from the estate and also 320 acres of land in
Illinois. HIe never received either of those items, but their
value was intended to be concentrated in the "home farm."
It is shown by the evidence that the title to 160 acres of the
220 in Illinois failed, through some delinquent tax proceedings,
and that George Oyster, as executor, sold the other 160 acres,
receiving therefor, it seems, the sum of $1800. Thus at least
$6800 was paid on parcels 3 and 5, by the equalization proceedings, leaving but $6325 due to 'the estate for those two
pieces of property This sum represents an asset of the estate
of Abraham Oyster, deceased. In the administration of his
executorship in Illinois and Pennsylvania. George Oyster
received a considerable amount of money- the exact amount
not being ascertainable from the present record, because he
does not appear to have made a final settlement of his executorship. That sum also represents an asset of the estate.
Likewise the amount received by David K. from the sale of
the personalty of the estate represents an asset.
At the sale on Nov. 15, 1869, certain lands (parcel 1) were
sold to strangers for $4920. According to the evidence herein,
that sum was paid to George Oyster and is, therefore, chargeable against him as an asset of the estate. These assets are
the portion of the estate which, under the will and the modifying agreements, was to be equally divided among the four

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

legatees. Again, running through the long period of years
since the death of Abraham Oyster, considerable money has
been paid out for taxes, etc., both by George Oyster and
David K., on property belonging to the estate. We are not
able from the present record to ascertain the exact amounts
paid by each.
There should, therefore, be an accounting between George
Oyster and David K. before there can be any exact settlement
of the estate as to them.
As respects Margaret Oyster and Margaretta, executrix,
etc., we are of the opinion that, as against David K.'s share in
the estate, they have no claim whatever. Although made
defendants in this suit, they did not defend, except to file a
,demurrer, which was overruled, and they never answered.
They have had their day m court, as regards David K. Oyster
and his share of the estate, and any claim which either
or both could have asserted against him cannot now be
prosecuted.
It will be observed that we have not seen fit to determine
the legal effect of the will of Abraham Oyster, or the modifying contract of March 3, 1868. We have proceeded, rather, on
the real intention of the parties, as manifested by that agreement and the subsequent oral agreements shown by the evidence to have existed. Those agreements when made were
fair to all interested, and having been acted upon and acquiesced in by every one concerned for a long period, ought to
be taken as the basis of the final settlement.
It is certainly for the interest of all concerned that litigation over this estate should cease. Nearly thirty years have
elapsed since the death of Abraham Oyster, and nearly the
whole of that period has been spent in litigation by his children over the property disposed of by his will. Animosities
have been engendered by these proceedings, and a total estrangement now exists between the brothers George and
David K. Moreover, the title to a large amount of valuable
property has been in dispute all that time. The interests of
the community, no less than the interests of the parties, require
that there should be an end of litigation respecting it.

ALBRIGHT v. OYSTER.
Opinion of the Court.

Tie decree of the court below -is reversed, with directions to
enter a decree enjozn2ing the defendant George Oysterfrom
further prosecution of his suit in ejectment, and decreeing
that he convey to David E., for the term of hls natural
life, with remainder over to his children,parcels 4, 6, 7 and
the one-fourth part of parcel 8, freed from all claim, lien
or encumbrancewhatsoever; and that he also convey in like
manner the "saw-mill" property 'in La Grange and the
"home farm," subject to any claim which may be found
due him from David Z's share in the estate, upon a final
accounting to be had of the matters between them. There
should be a reference to a master to ascertain the exact
amount due the estate from the administratorship of
David K. and the executorship of George Oyster; also the
amounts of taxes, etc.,pazd by both of them, and the $1250,
due from David K. to George, under the modifying agreements, should also be taken into consideraton,to the end
that a full and final settlement between them may be effected, and it s so ordered.

No. 134. OYSTER V. OYSTER. This case is supplementary to No.
133. The case is this After the decree of December 1, 1884, in
No. 133 was entered in the Circuit Court, to wit, April 15, 1885, the
complainants filed a new bill containing substantially the same
allegations with respect to the resulting trust in George Oyster as
did the. bill in No. 1,3, with certain others relating to an accountnag; and, seeking to enforce that same trust, the bill prayed for an
accounting with respect to the matters in difference between them,
and for a decree for the conveyance of the lands in dispute to the
complainants, subject to whatever lien might be found to exist, if
any, for any balance which might be found due the estate from
David K. Oyster, on such accounting.
To so much of the bill as sought an enforcement of the resulting
trust, George Oyster filed a plea in bar, setting up the former adjudication in No. 133. At the argument on this plea, the case was
treated as if a demurrer had been filed to it, and it was held, 'ir.
Justice Brewer (then Circuit Judge) delivering the opimon, that

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Syllabus.
the plea was good, and the bill was dismissed. 28 Fed. Rep. 909.
From .that decree of dismissal this appeal was prosecuted.
We are entirely convinced that the decree of the court below, in
this case, was correct. The merits of the questions relating to the
resulting trust in George Oyster were adjudicated by the Circuit
Court in No. 133, against the complainants, and so long as that
decree remained unreversed they were concluded by it. Those
questions were res judicata in that court. As the question of
accounting was subsidiary to, and dependent upon, the establishment of that resulting trust, it was proper to dismiss the bill as to
that feature of the case also.
It may be proper to add, in this connection, that the disposition
made by us of lNo. 133, above set forth, practically gives the complainants all they seek in this supplementary case, and as it is
clear that the real issues involved in this case are the same as in
No. 133, the decree herein is
Affirmed.

A married woman having been authorized by her husband and a District
