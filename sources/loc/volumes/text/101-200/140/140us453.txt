In re ROSS, Petitioner.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF YEW YORK.
No. 1683. Argued April 30, May 1, 1891.-Decided May 25, 1891.
By the Constitution of the United States a government is ordained and
established "for the United States of America," and not for countries
outside of their limits; and that Constitution can have no operation in
another country.
The laws passed by Congress to carry into effect the provisions of the
treaties granting exterritorial rights in Japan, China, etc. (Rev. Stat.
§§ 4083-4096), do no violation to the provisions of the Constitution of
the United States, although they do not require an indictment by a grand
jury to be found before the accused can be called upon to answer for the
crime of murder committed in those countries, or secure to him a jury
on his trial.
The provision in Rev. Stat. § 4086, that the jurisdiction conferred upon
ministers and consuls of the United States in Japan, China, etc., by
§§ 4083, 4084 and 4085, shall "be exercised and enforced in conformity
with the laws of the United States, gives to the accused an opportunity
of examining the complaint against him, or of having a copy of it, the
right to be confronted with the witnesses against him, and to crossexamine them, and to have the benefit of counsel, and secures regular
and fair trials to Americans committing offences there, but it does notrequire a previous presentment or indictment by a grand jury, and does
not give the right to a petit jury.
The jurisdiction given to domestic tribunals of the United States over
offences committed on the high seas in the district where the offender
may be found, or into which he may be first brought, is not exclusive of
the jurisdiction of a consular tribunal in Japan, China, etc., to try for a
similar offence, committed in a port of the country in which the tribunal
is established, when the offender is not taken to the United States.
Article IV of the treaty of June 17, 1857, with Japan is still in force, notwithstanding the provisions in Article XII of the treaty of July 29, 1858.
When a foreigner enters the mercantile marine of a nation, and becomes
one of the crew of a merchant vessel bearing its flag, he assumes a temporary allegiance to the flag, and, in return for the protection afforded

him, becomes subject to the laws by which that nation governs its vessels
and seamen.
A law or treaty should'be construed so as to give effect to the object designed, and to that end all its provisions must be examined in the light
of surrounding circumstances.
The fact that a vessel is American is evidence that seamen on board are
Americans also.
When a person convicted of murder accepts a "commutation of sentence
or pardon" upon condition that he be imprisoned at hard labor for the
term of his natural life, there can be no question as to the binding force
of the acceptance.

Tmns petitioner below, the appellant here, was imprisoned in
the- penitentiary at Albany in the State of New York. He
was convicted on the 20th of May; 1880, in the American consular tribunal in Japan, of the crime of murder, committed on
board of an American ship in the harbor of Yokohama in that
empire, and sentenced to death.
On the 6th of August following his sentence was commuted
by the President to imprisonment for life in the penitentiary
at Albany, and to that place he was taken and there he has
ever since been confined. Nearly ten years afterwards, on the
19th of March, 1890, he applied to the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Northern District of New York for a
writ of habeas corpus for his discharge, alleging that his conviction, sentence and imprisonment were unlawful, and stating
the causes thereof and the attendant circumstances. The writ
was issued, directed to the superintendent of the penitentiary,
who made return that he held the petitioner under the warrant of the President, of which a copy was annexed, and was
as follows:
"Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States of
America, to all to whom these presents shall come,

the American ship 'Bullion,' was, on the 20th day of May,

of the facts and circumstances of the case as they were presented in the record of the proceedings and by a report from

punishment than that of death

Statement of the Case.

To this warrant was annexed a copy of the petitioner's acceptance of the conditional pardon of the President, certified
to be correct by the United States consul general at Japan.
It was as follows
"I, John MYI.
Ross, the person named in the warrant of conditional pardon granted to me by the President of the United
States of America, dated the sixth day of August, 1880, and
of which the foregoing is a correct copy, do hereby acknowledge the delivery of said original warrant of conditional pardon to me, and do hereby voluntarily and without qualification
accept said conditional pardon with the condition thereof as
therein stated, to wit, that ¢I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President
of the United States of America, etc., etc., do hereby pardon
the said John 11. Ross on the condition that the said John M.
Ross be imprisoned at hard labor for the term of his natural

The case was then heard by the Circuit Court, counsel
appearing for the petitioner and the assistant United States
attorney for the government. On the hearing, a copy of the
record of the proceedings before the consular tribunal, and
of the communications by the consul general to the state
department respecting them, on file in that department,
was given in evidence. No objection was made to its adimssibility
The facts of the case as thus disclosed, so far as they were
deemed material t.o the decision. of the questions presented,
were substantially as follows
On the 9th of May, 1880, the appellant, John M. Ross, was
one of the crew of the American ship Bullion, then in the
waters of Japan, and lying at anchor in the harbor of Yokohama. On that day, on board of the ship, he assaulted Robert
Kelly, its second mate, with a knife, inflicting in his neck a
mortal wound, of which in a few minutes afterwards he died

on the deck of the ship. Ross was at once arrested by direction of the master of the vessel and placed in irons, and on the
same day he was taken ashore and confined in jail at Yokohama. On the following day, May 10, the master filed with
the American consul general at that place, Thomas B. -an
Buren, a complaint against Ross, charging him with the murder of the mate. It contained sufficient averments of the offence, was verified by the oath of the master, and to it the
consul general appended his certificate that he had reasonable
grounds for believing its contents were true. The complaint
described the accused as one "supposed to be a citizen of the
United States."
On the 18th of that month an amended complaint was filed
by the master of the ship with the consul general, in which
the accused was described as "an American seaman, duly and
lawfully enrolled and shipped and doing service as such seaman on board the American ship Bullion." The complaint
was also amended in some other particulars. It was as
follows

"THOS. B. VAN BiniEN,
" U S. Consul General."
To this amended complaint was annexed a certificate of the
consul general that he had reasonable grounds for believing
its contents to be true, similar to the one to the original complaint.
Previously to its being filed the accused appeared with
counsel before the consul general, and the complaint being
read to him, he presented an affidavit stating that he was a
subject of Great Britain, a native of Prince Edward's Island,
a dependency of the British Empire, and had never renounced
the rights or liabilities of a British subject or been expatriated
from his native allegiance or been naturalized in any other
country Upon this affidavit he contended that the court was
without jurisdiction over him, by reason of his being a subject
of Great Britain, and he prayed that he be discharged. His
contention was termed in the record a demurrer to the complaint.
The court held that as the accused was a seaman on an
American vessel, he was subject to its jurisdiction, and overruled the objection. The counsel of the accused then moved
that the charge against him be dismissed, on the ground that
he could not be held for the offence except upon the presentment or indictment of a grand jur', but this motion was also
overruled.
Four associates were drawn, as required by statute and the
consular regulations, to sit with the consul general on the trial
of the accused, and, being sworn to answer questions as to
their eligibility, the accused stated that he had no questions
to ask them on that subject. They were then sworn in to try
the cause "in accordance with court regulations." A motion
for a jury on the trial was also made and denied. The

amended complaint was then substituted in place of the original, to which no objection was interposed, and to it the accused pleaded "not guilty," and asked for the names of the
witnesses for the prosecution, which were furnished to him.
The witnesses were then sworn and examined, and they established beyond all possible doubt the offence of murder charged
against the accused, which was committed under circumstances
of great atrocity The court found him guilty of murder, and
he was sentenced to suffer death in such manner and at such
time and place as the United States minister should direct.
The conviction and sentence were concurred in by the four
associates, and were approved by Mr. Bingham, the minister
of the United States in Japan. The minister transmitted the
record of the case to the Department of State for the consideration of the President, and for commutation of the sentence
or pardon of the prisoner, if deemed advisable. The President
subsequently directed the issue to the prisoner of a pardon on
condition that he be imprisoned at hard labor for the term of
his natural life in the penitentiary at Albany, and it was
accepted by him on that condition. His sentence was accordingly commuted, and he was removed to the Albany penitentiary
The Circuit Court, after hearing argument of counsel and
full consideration of the subject, made an order on January
21, 1891, denying the motion of the prisoner for his discharge,
and remanding him to the penitentiary and the custody of its
superintendent. 44 Fed. Rep. 185. From that order the case
was brought here on appeal.
.ltr George 1F .irokwey, for appellant, made the following points .
I. The crime having been committed on board an American
vessel, although such vessel was lying in the harbor of Kanagawa, Japan, was not committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the Consular General Court of Kanagawa., but
within that of the United States. It was cognizable only by
the domestic tribunals of the United States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Argument for Appellant.

.First. The Consular General Court, being a court of
special and limited jurisdiction, has no powers save such as
are expressly conferred by the treaty and statutes to which
it owes its origin. These expressly confine its jurisdiction to
the territorial limits of Japan.
Second. The domestic jurisdiction of the modern State
extends to crimes committed upon private as well as public
vessels of the State upon the high seas. For the purposes of
this jurisdiction, a foreign port is regarded as being within the
high seas, and the ship as a part of the territory of the State
to which she belongs.
Third. The original and domestic jurisdiction of the Federal courts being adequate to deal with cases of this kind,
it will not be presumed that the Congress intended to set up a
novel jurisdiction of limited and inferior character, to supersede or compete with the former.
Fourth. The mode in which the jurisdiction of the United
States in such cases must be exercised is prescribed by statute.
It is expressly provided that all crimes committed on American
vessels on the high seas shall be tried within the United States.
II. If it be claimed that the offence in question was committed in Japan, and not upon the high seas, the consular
jurisdiction of the United States is wholly excluded by the
fact that the record does not disclose facts conferring jurisdiction under the treaties and laws.
First. The treaties of the United States with Japan, and
the laws passed by Congress in pursuance thereof, expressly
restrict the juvlsdiction of the consular courts to citizens of
the United States. It does not appear that IRoss was a citizen
of the United States.
Second. The statutes creating the consular courts, as well
as the treaties under which they are instituted, and from
which they derive such authority and jurisdiction as they
possess, expressly subject that jurisdiction to the laws of the
United States.
Third. The claim that the Constitution has no extraterritorial force is disproved by the existence and operation of the
consular court itself.

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

IV The refusal to allow the accused a trial by jury was
a fatal defect in the jurisdiction exercised by the court, and
renders its judgment absolutely void.
First. The jury contemplated by the Constitution (Art.
III, § 2, subd. 3, amendments, Art. VI), and demanded by
the appellant, is a common law jury of twelve men.
Second. There appears to be nothing in the legislation of
Congress relating to the exercise of this consular jurisdiction
to preclude compliance with the constitutional requirement.
AMp Asmtant Attorney General Parkerfor appellee.
MR. JusTicE FrELD, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The Circuit Court did not refuse to discharge the petitioner
upon any independent conclusion as to the validity of the
legislation of Congress establishing the consular tribunal in
Japan, and the trial of Americans for offences committed
within the territory of that country, without the indictment
of a grand jury, and without a trial by a petit jury, but placed
its decision upon the long and uniform acquiescence by the
executive, administrative and legislative departments of the
government in the validity of the legislation. Nor did the Circuit Court consider whether the status of the petitioner as a
citizen of 'the United States, or as an American within the
meaning of the treaty with Japan, could be questioned, while
he was a seaman of an American ship, under the protection
of the American flag, but simply stated the view taken on
that subject by the Minister to Japan, the State Department,
and the President. Said the court "During the thirty years
since the statutes conferring the judicial powers on ministers
and consuls, which have been referred to, were enacted, that
jurisdiction has been freely exercised. Citizens of the United
States have been tried for serious offences before these officers,
without preliminary indictment or a common law jury, and
convicted and punished. These trials have been authorized
by the regulations, orders and decrees of ministers, and it

Opinion of the Court.

must be presumed that the regulations, orders and decrees of
ministers prescribing the mode of trial have been transmitted
to the Secretary of the State, and by him been laid before Congress for revision, as required by law Unless the petitioner
was not properly subject to this jurisdiction because he was not
a citizen of the United States, his trial and sentence were in
all respects modal, as well as substantial, regular and valid
under the laws of Congress, according to the construction
placed upon these statutes by the acquiescence of the executive, administrative and legislative departments of the government for this long period of time."
Under these circumstances the Circuit Court was of opinion
that it ought not to adjudge that the sentence imposed upon
the petitioner was utterly unwarranted and void, when the
case was one in which his rights could be adequately protected
by this court, and when a decision by the Circuit Court setting him at liberty, although it might- be reversed, would be
practically irrevocable.
The Circuit Court might have found an additional ground
for not calling in question the legislation of Congress, in the
uniform practice of civilized governments for centuries to provide consular tribunals in other than Christian countries, or to
invest their consuls with judicial authority, which is the same
thing, for the trial of their own subjects or citizens for offences
committed in those countries, as well as for the settlement of
civil disputes between them, and in the uniform recognition,
down to the time of the formation of our government, of the
fact that the establishment of such tribunals was among the
most important subjects for treaty stipulations. This recognition of their importance has continued ever since, though
the powers of those tribunals are now more carefully defined
than formerly Datnese v Hale, 91 U. S. 13.
The practice of European governments to send officers to
reside in foreign countries, authorized to exercise a limited
jurisdiction over vessels and seamen of their country, to watch
the interests of their countrymen and to assist in adjusting
their disputes and protecting their commerce, goes back to a
very early period, even preceding what are termed the Mid-

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

dle Ages. During those ages these commercial magistrates,
generally designated as consuls, possessed to some extent a
representative character, sometimes discharging judicial and
diplomatic functions. In other than Christian countries they
were, by treaty stipulations, usually clothed with authority to
hear complaints against their countrymen and to sit in judgment upon them when charged with public offences. After
the rise of Islamism, and the spread of its- folloi'yers over
eastern Asia and other countries bordering on the Iediterranean, the exercise of this judicial authority became a matter
of great concern. The intense hostility of the people of
]Moslem faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians,
affected all their intercourse, and all proceedings had in their
tribunals. Even the rules of evidence adopted by them
placed those of different faith on unequal grounds in any controversy with them. For this cause, and by reason of the
barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries,
and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from
parties accused, it was a matter of deep interest to Christian
governments to withdraw the trial of their subjects, when
charged with the commission of a public offence, from the
arbitrary and despotic action of the local officials. Treaties
conferring such jurisdiction upon these consuls were essential
to the peaceful residence of Christians within those countries
and the successful prosecution of commerce with their people.
The treaty-making power vested in our government extends
to all proper subjects of negotiation with foreign governments.
It can, equally with any of the former or present governments of Europe, make treaties providing for the exercise of
judicial authority in other countries by its officers appointed
to reside therein.
We do not understand that any question is made by counsel
as to its power in this respect. His objection is to the legislation by which such treaties are carried out, contending that,
so far as crimes of a felonious character are concerned, the
same protection and guarantee against an undue accusation or
an unfair trial, secured by the Constitution to citizens of the
'United States at home, should be enjoyed by them abroad.

OCTOBER TER-M, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

In none of the laws which have been passed by Congress to
give effect to treaties of the kind has there been any attempt
to require indictment by a grand jury before one can be
called upon to answer for a public offence of that grade committed in those countries, or to secure a jury on the trial of the
offence. Yet the laws on that subject have been passed without objection to their constitutionality Indeed, objection on
that ground was never raised in any quarter, so far as we are
informed, until a recent period.
It is now, however, earnestly pressed by counsel for the
petitioner, but we do not think it tenable. By the Constitution a government is ordained and established "for the United
States of America," and not for countries outside of their
limits. The guarantees it affords against accusation of capital
or infamous crimes, except by indictment or presentment by
a grand jury, and for an impartial trial by a jury when thus
accused, apply only to citizens and others within the United
States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences
committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary
sojourners abroad. Cook v Undted States, 138 U. S. 157, 181.
The Constitution can have no operation in another country
When, therefore, the representatives or officers of our government are permitted to exercise authority of any kind in
another country, it must be on such conditions as the two
countries may agree, the laws of neither one being obligatory
upon the other. The deck of a private American vessel, it is
true, is considered for many purposes constructively as territory of the United States, yet persons on board of such vessels,
whether officers, sailors, or passengers, cannot invoke the protection of the provisions referred to until brought within the
actual territorial boundaries of the United States. And,
besides, their enforcement abroad in numerous places, where
it would be highly important to have consuls invested with
judicial authority, would be impracticable from the impossibility of obtaining a competent grand or petit jury The
requirement of such a body to accuse and to try an offender
would, in a majority of cases, cause an abandonment of all
prosecution. The framers of the Constitution, who were fully

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

aware of the necessity of having judicial authority exercised
by our consuls in non-Christian countries, if commercial intercourse was to be had with their people, never could have supposed that all the guarantees in the administration of the law
upon criminals at home were to be transferred to such consular establishments, and applied before an American who had
committed a felony there could be accused and tried. They
must have known that such a requirement would defeat the
main purpose of investing the consul with judicial authority
While, therefore, in one aspect the American accused of
crime committed in those countries is deprived of the guarantees of the Constitution against unjust accusation and a
partial trial, yet in another aspect he is the gainer, in being
withdrawn from the procedure of their tribunals, often arbitrary and oppressive, and sometimes accompanied with extreme
cruelty and torture. Letter of Mr. Cushing to Mr. Calhoun

We turn now to the treaties between Japan and the United
States.
The treaty of June 17, 1857, executed by the consul general
of the United States and the governors of Simoda, is the one
which first conceded to the American consul in Japan authority to try Americans committing offences in that country
Article IV of that treaty is as follows
"ART.IV Americans committing offences in Japan shall
be tried by the American consul general or consul, and shall
be punished according to American laws. Japanese committing offences against Americans shall be tried by the Japanese
authorities and punished according to Japanese laws." 11
Stat. 723.
The treaty with Japan of July 29, 1858, in some particulars
changes the phraseology of the concession of judicial authority
VOL. cXL--30

OCTOBER TERAI,

Opinion of the Court.

to the American consul in Japan, but, as we shall see subsequently, without revocation of the concession itself. Its sixth
article is as follows:
"ART. VI. Americans committing offences against Japanese
shall be tried in American consular courts and when guilty
shall be punished according to American law Japanese committing offences against Americans shall be tried by the Japanese authorities and punished according to Japanese law The
consular courts shall be open to Japanese creditors, to enable
them to recover their just claims against American citizens and
the Japanese courts shall in like manner be open to American
citizens for the recovery'of their just claims against Japanese."
12 Stat. 1056.
As will be seen, the language of the fourth article of the
treaty of 1857 is that "Americans committing offences in
Japan shall be tried," etc., while the language of the sixth
article of the treaty of 1858 is that "Americans committing
offences against Japanese shall be tried," etc. Offences
committed in Japan and offences committed against Japanese
are not necessarily identical in meaning. The latter standing
by itself would require a more restricted construction. But
the twelfth article of that treaty obviates that. It is as follows
"ART. XII. Such of the provisions of the treaty made by
Commodore Perry and signed at Kanagawa on the 31st of
March, 1854, as conflict with the provisions of this treaty are
hereby revoked, and as all the provisions of a convention
executed by the consul general of the United States and the
governors of Simoda, on the 17th of June, 1857, are incorporated in this treaty, that convention is also revoked."
It will thus be perceived that the revocation of the treaty
of 1857 was made upon the assumption and declaration that
all its provisions were incorporated into the treaty of 1858.
The revocation must, therefore, be held to be limited to those
provisions and those only which are thus incorporated, that
treaty still remaining in force as to the unincorporated provisions. This has been the practical construction given to the
alleged revocation by the authorities of both countries - a

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

construction which, in view of the erroneous statement as to
the incorporation into the new treaty of all the provisions of
the former one, isreasonable and just.
Our government has always treated Article IV of the
treaty of 1857 as continuing in force, and it is published as
such in the United States Consular Regulations, issued in
1888. Appendix :No. 1, p. 313. Its official interpretation is
found in Article 71 of those regulations, which declares that
"consuls have exclusive jurisdiction over crimes and offences
committed by citizens of the United States in Japan." Mr.
Bingham, our minister to that country for several years after
the treaty of 1858, always assumed the incorporation into that
treaty of all the provisions of the treaty of 1857, or that they
were saved by it. When the prisoner reached San Francisco,
on his way from Japan to Albany, he applied to the Circuit
Court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus, and
cited the sixth article of the treaty of 1858, insisting that it
only provided for the trial of Americans by American consular courts in Japan for offences committed against Japanese,
and therefore he could not be held to answer for the murder
of the second officer of the American ship Bullion, when in
Japanese waters, because he was not a Japanese subject. In
a communication made under date of June 8, 1881, by the
minister to the Secretary of State, reference is made to this
position, and the following language is used. "Nothing, in
my opinion, could more strongly testify to the utter weakness
of the claim made for Ross against the government than this
attempt to limit the jurisdiction of our consuls in Japan over
Americans, guilty of crimes by them committed within this
empire, to such crimes only as they should commit upon the
persons of Japanese subjects. According to this logic, Americans may in Japan murder each other and the citizens or subjects of all lands save the subjects of Japan with impunity as it is admitted by this government that it cannot try an
American for any offence whatever -and it must also be conceded that the tribunals of no other government than our own
can try Americans for crimes by them committed within this
empire. In giving my reasons to the department for sustain-

Opinion of the Court.

ing the jurisdiction of the United States in this case, and for
approving as I did the conviction of Ross, in which the consul
general and the four associates who sat with him had coneurred, I cited Article IV of our convention of 1857 witn
Japan, to wit ' That Americans committing offences in Japan
shall be tried by the American consul general or consul, and
shall be punished according to American law' This provision
of the convention of 1857 and all other provisions thereof were
saved and incorporated in our treaty of 1858 with Japan,
Article XII, [quoted above.] You will observe that Mr. Townsend Harris was the consul general of the United States who
negotiated both of these treaties with Japan, and that the
treaty of 1858 was ratified April 12, 1860, and that thereafter,
to wit, June 22, 1860, Congress passed the act to carry into
effect this treaty with Japan, and provided that the minister
and consuls of the United States in Japan be fully empowered to arraign and try in the manner (in said statute provided)
all citizens of the United States charged with offences against
law committed' (by them in Japan,) [sec. 4084, Rev Stat.], and
also by section 4086 provided that the jurisdiction in both
all cases be exercivil and criminal matters in Japan shall '
cised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United
States, which so far as necessary to execute such treaty are
extended over all citizens of the United States therein, and
over all others to the extent the terms of the treaty justify or
require.' Here was the construction above stated by me asserted by the same Senate which ratified the treaty, and by
the same President who approved both the treaty and the act
of Congress. The President and the department have always
construed the treaty of 1858 as carrying with it and incorporating therein the fourth article and all other provisions of the
convention of 1857."
The legislation of Congress to carry into effect the treaty
with Japan is found in the Revised Statutes, in sections most
of which apply equally to treaties with China, Siam, Egypt
and Madagascar (secs. 4083-4091). Confining ourselves to the
treaty with Japan only, we find that the legislation secures a
regular and fair trial to Americans committing offences withim
that empire.

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

It enacts that the minister and consuls of the United States,
appointed to reside there, shall, in addition to other powers
and duties imposed upon them respectively, be invested with
the judicial authority therein described, which shall appertain
to their respective offices and be a part of the duties belonging
thereto, so far as the same is allowed by treaty, and empowers them to arraign and try, in the manner therein provided,
all citizens of the United States charged with offences against
law committed in that country, and to sentence such offenders
as therein provided, and to issue all suitable and necessary
process to carry their authority into execution. It declares
that their jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters shall
in all cases be exercised and enforced in conformity with the
laws of the United States, which, so far as necessary to execute the treaty and suitable to carry it into effect, are extended
over all citizens of the United States in Japan, and over all
others there to the extent that the terms of the treaty justify
or require. It also provides that where such laws are not
adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the
law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner
over such citizens and others, and that if neither the common
law, nor the law of equity, or admiralty, nor the statutes of
the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies,
the minister shall, by decrees and regulations, which shall
have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.
Each of the consuls is authorized, upon facts within his own
knowledge, or which he has good reason to believe true, or
upon complaint made or information filed in writing and authenticated in such way as shall be prescribed by the minister,
to issue his warrant for the arrest of any citizen of the United
States charged with committing in the country an offence
against law, and to arraign and try any such offender, and
to sentence him to punishment in the manner therein prescribed.
The legislation also declares that insurrection or rebellion
against the government, with intent to subvert the same, and
murder, shall be punishable with death, but that no person

Opinion of the Court.

shall be convicted thereof unless the consul and his associates
in the trial all concur in the opinion, and the minister approves
of the conviction. It also provides that whenever in any case
the consul is of opinion that, by reason of the legal questions
which may arise therein, assistance will be useful to him, or
that a severer punishment than previously specified in certain
cases will be required, he shall summon to sit with him on the
trial one or more citizens of the United States, not exceeding
four, and in capital cases not less than four, who shall be taken
by lot from a list which has been previously submitted to and
approved by the minister, and shall be persons of good repute
and competent for the duty
The jurisdiction of the consular tribunal, as is thus seen, is
to be exercised and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the United States; and of course in pursuance of them the
accused will have an opportunity of examining the complaint
against him, or will be presented with a copy stating the offence he has committed, will be entitled to be confronted with
the witnesses against him and to cross-examine them, and to
have the benefit of counsel, and, indeed, will have the benefit
of all the provisions necessary to secure a fair trial before the
consul and his associates. The only complaint of this legislation made by counsel is that, in directing the trial to be had
before the consul and associates summoned to sit with him, it
does not require a previous presentment or indictment by a
grand jury, and does not give to the accused a petit jury
The want of such clauses, as affecting the validity of the legislation, we have already considered. It is not pretended that
the prisoner did not have, in other respects, a fair trial in the
consular court.
It is further objected to the proceedings in the consular
court that the offence with which the petitioner was charged,
having been committed on board of a vessel of the United
States in Japanese waters, was not triable before the consular
court, and that the petitioner, being a subject of Great Britain, was not within the jurisdiction of that court. These
objections we will now proceed to consider.
The argument presented in support of the first of these

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

positions is briefly this. Congress has provided for the punishment of murder committed upon the high seas, or any arm
or bay of the sea within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of any
particular State, and has provided that the trial of all offences committed upon the high seas, out of the jurisdiction of
any particular State, shall be in the district where the offender
is found or into which he is first brought. The term "high
seas" includes waters on the sea coast without the boundaries
of low-water mark, and the waters of the port of Yokohama
constitute, within the meaning of the statute, high seas. Therefore it is contended that, although the ship Bullion was at the
time lying m those waters, the offence for which the appellant
was tried and convicted was committed on the high seas and
within the jurisdiction of the domestic tribunals of the United
States, and is not punishable elsewhere. In support of this.
position it is assumed that the jurisdiction of the consular
court is limited to offences committed on land, within the territory of Japan, to the exclusion of offences committed on
waters within that territory
There is, as it seems to us, an obvious answer to this argument. The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high
seas in the district where the offender may be found, or into
which he may be first brought, is not exclusive of the jurisdiction of the consular tribunal to try a similar offence when
committed in a port of a foreign country in which that tribunal is established, and the offender is not taken to the United
States. There is no law of Congress compelling the master
of a vessel to carry or transport him to any home port when
he can be turned-over to a consular court having jurisdiction
of similar offences committed in the foreign country I Opinions Attys. Gen. '722. The provisions conferring jurisdiction
in capital cases upon the consuls in Japan, when the offence
is committed in that country, are embodied in the Revised
Statutes, with the provisions as to the jurisdiction of domestic
tribunals over such offences committed on the high seas; and
those statutes were renacted together, and, as reenacted,
went into operation at *the same time. To both effect must

Opinion of the Court.

be given in proper cases, where they are applicable. We do
not adopt the limitation stated by counsel to the jurisdiction
of the consular tribunal, that it extends only to offences committed on land. Neither the treaty nor the Revised Statute
to carry them into effect contain any such limitation. The
latter speak of offences committed in the country of Japan meaning within the territorial jurisdiction of that country which includes its ports and navigable waters as well as its.
lands.
The position that the petitioner, being a subject of Great
Britain, was not within the jurisdiction of the consular court,
is more plausible, but admits, we think, of a sufficient answer.
The national character of the petitioner, for all the purposes;
of the consular jurisdiction, was determinable by his enlistment as one of the crew of the American ship Bullion. By
such enlistment he becomes an American seaman - one of an
American crew on board of an American vessel -and as such
entitled to the protection and benefits of all the laws passed
by Congress on behalf of American seamen, and subject to all
their obligations and liabilities. Although his relations to the
British government are not so changed that, after the expiration of his enlistment on board of the American ship, that
government may not enforce his obligation of allegiance, and
he on the other hand may not be entitled to invoke its protection as a British subject, that relation was changed during his
service of seaman on board of the American ship under his.
enlistment. He could then insist upon treatment as an American seaman, and invoke for his protection all the power of the
United States which could be called into exercise for the protection of seamen who were native born. He owes for that
time to the country to which the ship on which he is serving
belongs, a temporary allegiance, and must be held to all
its responsibilities. The question has been treated more as
a political one for diplomatic adjustment, than as a legal one.
to be determined by the judicial tribunals, and has been the
subject of correspondence between our government and that.
of Great Britain.
The position taken by our government is expressed in a.

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

communication from the Secretary of State, to the British
government, under date of June 16, 1881. It was the assertion of a principle which the Secretary insisted "is in entire
conformity with the principles of English law as applied to a
mercantile service almost identical with our own in its organization and regulation. That principle is that, when a foreigner
enters the mercantile marine of any nation and becomes one
of the crew of a vessel having undoubtedly a national character, he assumes a temporary allegiance to the flag under which
he serves, and in return for the protection afforded him becomes subject to the laws by which that nation in the exercise
of an unquestioned authority governs its vessels and seamen.
If, therefore," he continued, "the government of the United
States has by treaty stipulation with Japan acquired the privilege of administering its own laws upon its own vessels and in
relation to its own seamen in Japanese territory, then every
American vessel and every seaman of its crew are subject to
the jurisdiction which by such treaty has been transferred to
the government of the United States."
"If Ross had been a passenger on board of the Bullion, or
if, residing in Yokohama, he had come on board temporarily
and had then committed the murder, the question of jurisdiction would have been very different. But, as it was, he was
part of the crew, a duly enrolled seaman under American laws,
enjoying the protection of this government to such an extent
that he could have been protected from arrest by the British
authorities; and his subjection to the laws of the United
States cannot be avoided just at the moment that it suits his
convenience to allege foreign citizenship. The law which he
violated was the law made by the United States for the government of United States vessels; the person murdered was
one of his own superior officers whom he had bound himself
to respect and obey, and it is difficult to see by what authority
the British government can assume the duty or claim the right
to vindicate that law or protect that officer."
"The mercantile service is certainly a national service,
although not quite in the sense in which that term would be
applied to the national navy It is an organized service, gov-

erned by a special and complex system of law, administered
by national officers, such as collectors, harbor masters, shipping
masters and consuls, appointed by national authority This
system of law attaches to the vessel and crew when they leave
a national port and accompanies them round the globe, regulating their lives, protecting their persons and punishing their
offences. The sailor, like the soldier during his enlistment,
knows no other allegiance than to the country under whose
flag he serves. This law may be suspended while he is in the
ports of a foreign nation, but where such foreign nation grants
to the country which he serves the power to administer its
own laws in such foreign territory, then the law under which
he enlisted again becomes supreme."
The Secretary concluded his communication with the following expression of the determination of our government
"So impressed is this government with the importance and
propriety of these views, that while it will receive with the
most respectful consideration the expression of any different
conviction which Her Britanmc Majesty's government may
entertain, it will yet feel bound to instruct its consular and
diplomatic officers in the East, that in China and Japan the
judicial authority of the consuls of the United States will be
considered as extending over all persons duly shipped and
enrolled upon the articles of any merchant vessel of the United
States, whatever be the nationality of such person. And all
offences which would be justiciable by the consular courts of
the United States, where the persons so offending are native
born or naturalized citizens of the United States, employed
in the merchant service thereof, are equally justiciable by
the same consular courts in the case of seamen of foreign
nationality"
The determination thus expressed was afterwards carried
out by incorporating the doctrine into the permanent regulations of the department for the guide, of the consuls of this
country 12d regulation.
The views thus forcibly expressed present in our judgment
the true status of the prisoner while an enlisted seaman on the
American vessel, and give effect to the purpose of the treaty

Opinion of the Court.

and the legislation of Congress. The treaty uses the term
"Americans" m speaking of those who may be brought within
the jurisdiction of the consular court for offences committed
in Japan. The statute designates them as "citizens of the
United States," and yet extends the laws of the United States,
so far as they may be necessary to execute the treaty and are
suitable to carry the same into effect, not only over all citizens
of the United States in Japan, but also over "all otker's to the
extent that the terms of the treaty justify or require."
Reading the treaty and statute together in view of the purpose designed to be accomplished, we are satisfied that it was
intended by them to bring within our laws all who are citizens,
and also all who, though not strictly citizens, are by their service equally entitled to the care and protection df the government. It is a canon of interpretation to so construe a law or
a treaty as to give effect to the object designed, and for that
purpose all of its provisions must be examined in the light of
attendant and surrounding circumstances. To some terms and
expressions a literal meaning will be given, and to others a
larger and more extended one. The reports of adjudged cases
and approved legal treatises are full of illustrations of the
application of this rule. The inquiry in all such cases is as to
what was intended in the law by the legislature, and in the
treaty by the contracting parties.
In Geofroy v Rggs, 133 U. S. 258, which was before this
court at the last term, it was held that the District of Columbia, as a political community, is one of "the States of the
Union," within the meaning of that term as used in the consular convention of 1853 with France, such construction belig
necessary to give consistency to the provisions of the convention, and not defeat the consideration given by France for her
concession of certain rights to citizens of the United States.
And in the present case, to carry out the intention of the
treaty and statute in question, they will be construed to apply
to all parties who are by public law, or the law of the country, entitled to be treated for the time, from their employment
and service as citizens. There are many adjudications to the
effect that such character will be ascribed to parties and they

be held liable to all its consequences, and entitled to all its
benefits, on other grounds than birth or naturalization.
A statute of Henry VIII enacted that if anybody should
rob or take "the goods of the king's subjects within this
realm," and be found guilty, the party robbed should have
restitution of the goods. Of this statute Sir Matthew Hale
said that "though it speaks of the king's subjects, it extends
to aliens robbed, for though they are not the king's natural
born subjects, they are the king's subjects when in England,
by local allegiance." 1 Hale's Pleas of the Crown, p. 542.
In United States v Rolmes, 5 Wheat. 412, which is in point
in the case before us, certain parties were indicted in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of iMassachusetts and convicted of murder on th.6 high seas. It appeared
that a vessel, apparently Spanish, was captured by privateers
from Buenos Ayres, and a prize crew was put on board, of
whom the prisoners were a part. One of them was a citizen
of the United States and the others were foreigners. The
crime was committed by drowning the person, whose death
was charged, by the prisoners driving or throwing him overboard. On motion for a new trial certain questions arose on
which the judges were divided in opinion. One of these was,
whether it made any difference as to the point of jurisdiction,
whether the prisoners or any of them were citizens of the
United States, or that the offence was committed, not on board
of. any vessel, but on the high seas. The court said that the
question contained two propositions, one as to the national
character of the offender and the person against whom the
offence was committed, and second as to the place where it
was committed. In respect to the first the court was of the
opinion that it made no difference whether the offender was a
citizen of the United States or not, adding, "if it (the offence)
be committed on board of a foreign vessel by a citizen of the
United States, or on board of a vessel of the United States by
a foreigner, the offender is to be considered, pro 4ac vee, and
in respect to this subject, as belonging to the nation under
whose flag he sails."
The case of The Queen v Anderson, L. R. 1 Crown Cases

IN RE ROSS.
Opinion of the Court.

:Reserved, 161, is still more in point. There one James Anderson, an American citizen, was indicted at the Central Criminal
Court in England for murder on board a vessel belonging to
the port of Yarmouth, in Nova Scotia, she was registere'd in
London, and was sailing under the British flag. At the time
the offence was committed the vessel was in the river Garonne,
within the boundaries of the French Empire, on her way up
to Bordeaux, which city is by the course of the river about
ninety miles from the open sea. The vessel had proceeded
about half way up the river, and was at the time of the offence
about 300 yards from the nearest shore, the river at that place
being about half a mile wide. The tide flows up to the place
and beyond it. The prisoner was convicted, and the case was
reserved for the opinion of the court. It was contended on
behalf of the prisoner that the court had no jurisdiction in
the case because he was an American citizen and in a foreign
country at the time the offence was committed, and also that
section 267 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which it was said
the Crown relied upon at the trial, applied only to British seamen. Mr. Justice Blackburn in regard to this last statement
observed "The expression, British seamen, may mean one
who, whatever his nationality, is serving on board a British
ship," and also that it had been decided "that a ship, which
bears a nation's flag, is to be treated as a part of the territory
of that nation. A ship is a kind of floating island." Counsel
answered that if it floated into the territory of another nation
it would cease to be so, and the jurisdiction of the flag would
then be excluded, and that the man might have been tried in
France, to which Chief Justice Bovill replied "Even if he
might, why should not this country legislate to regulate the
conduct of those on board its own vessels, or so as to have concurrent jurisdiction ?" All the judges concurred in sustaining
the conviction. In giving his opinion the Chief Justice said.
"There is no doubt that the place where the offence was committed was within the territory of France, and that the prisoner was, therefore, subject to the laws of France, which that
nation might enforce if they thought fit, but at the same time
he was also within a British merchant vessel, on board that

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

vessel as a part of the crew, and, as such, he must be taken to
have been under the protection of the British law, and also
amenable to its provisions. It is said that the prisoner was an
American citizen, but he had embarked by his own consent on
board a British ship, and was at the time a portion of its crew
There are many observations to be found in various writers to
show that in some instances, though subject to American law
as a citizen of America, and to the law of France as being
found within French territory, yet that he must also be considered as being within British jurisdiction as forming a part
of the crew of a British vessel, upon the principle, that the
jurisdiction of a country is preserved over its vessels, though
they may be in ports or rivers belonging to another nation."
p. 165.
Mr. Justice Blackburn said "Where a nation allows a vessel to sail under her flag, and the crew have the protection of
that flag, common sense and justice require that .they should
be punishable by the law of the flag." p. 170.
The views expressed by the Department of State, quoted
above, are in harmony with the doctrine uniformly asserted
by our government against the claim by England of a right to
take its countrymen from the deck of an American merchant
vessel and press them into its naval service. It is a part of
our history that the assertion of this claim, and its enforcement in many instances, caused a degree of irritation among
our people which no conduct of any other country has ever
produced. Its enforcement was deemed a great indignity upon
this country and a violation of our right of sovereignty, our
vessels being considered as parts of our territory It led to
the War of 1812, and although that war closed without obtaining a relinquishment of the claim, its further assertion was
not attempted. At last, in a communication by Mr. Webster,
then Secretary of State, to Lord Ashburton, the special British
minister to this country, on the 8th of August, 1842, the claim
was repudiated, and the announcement made that it would no
longer be allowed by our government and must be abandoned.
The conclusion of Mr. Webster's communication bears upon
the question before us. After referring to the claim of Great

Opinion of the Court.

Britain, and demonstrating the injustice of the position and
its violation of national rights, he said "In the early disputes
between the two governments, on this so long-contested topic,
the distinguished person to whose hands were first intrusted
the seals of this department declared, that ' the simplest rule
will be, that the vessel being American shall be evidence that
the seamen on board are such.' Fifty years' experience, the
utter failure of many negotiations, and a careful reconsideration now had of the whole subject at a moment when the passions are laid, and no present interest or emergency exists to
bias the judgment, have convinced this government that this
is not only the simplest and best, but the only rule which can
be adopted and observed consistently with the rights and
honor of the United States, and the security of their citizens.
That rule announces, therefore, what will hereafter be the
principle maintained by their government. In every regularly
documented American merchant vessel, the crew who navigate it will find their protection in the flag which is over
them." Webster's Works, Vol. VI, p. 325.
This rule, that the vessel being American is evidence that
the seamen on board are such, is now an established doctrine
of this country; and in support of it there is with the American people no diversity of opinion and can be no division of
action.
We are satisfied that the true rule of construction in the
present case was adopted by the Department of State in
the correspondence with the English government, and that
the action of the consular tribunal in taking jurisdiction of the
prisoner Ross, though an English subject, for the offence
committed, was authorized. While he was an enlisted seaman on the American vessel, which floated the American flag,
he was, within the meaning of the statute and the treaty, an
American, under the protection and subject to the laws of the
United States equally with the seaman who was native born.
As an American seaman he could have demanded a trial
before the consular court as a matter of right, and must therefore be held subject to it as a matter of obligation.
We have not overlooked the objection repeatedly made and

Opinion of the Court..

earnestly pressed by counsel, that the consular tribunal is a
court of limited jurisdiction. It is undoubtedly a court of
that character, limited by the treaty and the statutes passed
to carry it into effect, and its jurisdiction cannot be extended
beyond their legitimate meaning. But their construction is
not, therefore, to be so restricted as to practically defeat the
purposes to be accomplished by the treaty, but rather so as to
give it full operation, in order that it may not be a vain and
nugatory act.
It is true that the occasion for consular tribunals in Japan
may hereafter be less than at present, as every year that
country progresses in civilization and in the assimilation of its
system of judicial procedure to that of Christian countries,
as well as in the improvement of its penal statutes, but the
system of consular tribunals which have a general similarity
in their main provisions, is of the highest importance, and
their establishment in other than Christian countries, where
our people may desire to go in pursuit of commerce, will often
be essential for the protection of their persons and property
We have not considered the objection to the discharge of
the prisoner on the ground that he accepted the conditional
pardon of the President. If his conviction and sentence were
void for want of jurisdiction in the consular tribunal, it may
be doubtful whether he was estopped, by his acceptance of the
pardon, from assailing their validity, but into that inquiry
we need not go, for the consular court having had jurisdiction
to try and sentence him, there can be no question as to the
binding force of the acceptance.
Order afflrmed.
