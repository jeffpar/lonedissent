There is no material distinction, in principle, between this
case and the cases just cited. Comanche County v Lewts involved the validity of bonds similar to these in suit, which had
been issued by Comanche County, and Lewis v Commisstoners involved the validity of similar bonds issued by Barbour
County, Kansas. The bonds in suit in both of those cases
were held valid and binding upon the respective counties,
and the reasons for such rulings were very fully and clearly
stated in the opinions therein. This case is ruled by those,

.Â£ET!A LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY v. WARD.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 1388.

Argued iarch 4, 5, 1891. - Decided Aprii 27, 191.

When the trial court has given the substance of a requested charge to the
jury, it is under no 'obligation to repeat it in the requested language.
When evidence offered by one party at the trial tends to discredit that offered
by the other, it is for the jury to weigh and decide, under proper instructions from the court.
In an action to recover on a policy of life insurance where the defence
is that the death was caused by intemperance, which by the terms of the
policy exempted the company from liability, it is no error in the court to
instruct the jury that they are at liberty to reject the diagnosis of a

medical witness offered on behalf of the defendant, if they have no confidence in his skill and experience, the same having been assailed by the
plaintift's testimony.
An instruction to the 3ury in such case that the evidence of the defence
need not be so convincing as to be beyond reasonable doubt, but that the
weight of testimony must decidedly preponderate on the side of the defendant is not error, when the two clauses are taken together and in connection with the whole tenor and effect of the charge, although the
phrase "decidedly preponderate" is not technically exact with reference
to the weight and quantity of evidence necessary to justify a verdict in
civil cases.
In a case like this, this court is confined to the consideration of exceptions
taken at the trial, to the admission or re3ection of evidence and to the
charge of the court and its refusals to charge; and it has no concern
with questions of fact or with the-weight to be given to evidence which
was properly admitted.

THIs was an action on a policy of life insurance. There
have been three trials of it by jury, in each of which there
has been a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, for the full amount
of the policy The case was before the court at October term,
1887, Etna .ife Ins. Co. v Davey, 123 U S. 739, where the
judgment of the court below on the first verdict was reversed
and a new trial ordered because of certain erroneous instructions to the jury in the charge of the court. The proceedings
in the court below in relation to the first and second trials are
reported in 20 Fed. Rep. 482, 20 Fed. Rep. 494, 38 Fed. Rep.
650, and 40 Fed. Rep. 911.
The case as now presented is as follows The defendant in
error, Ada Ward, formerly Ada Davey, was the wife of William A. Davey, of Jersey City, New Jersey, and the beneficiary named in a policy of life insurance issued by the plaintiff
in error on the life of Mr. Davey, for the sum of $10,000. dated
July 16, 1879. Mr. Davey died on the 6th of August, 1881, at
Alexandria Bay, New York, and within ninety days thereafter, to wit, August 16, 1881, his widow gave to the company
due notice and proofs of his death, as required by the terms
of the policy, and demanded payment of the amount named
therein, which was refused, and therleupon this action was
brought. So far as the present status of the case is concerned,
the defence to the action is, that there was a breach of that

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

condition in the policy, on the part of Mr. Davey, which provided that if he "shall become so far intemperate as to impair
his health or induce delirium tremens," then the policy should
become null and void.
On the trial of the case before Judge Green and a jury, -the
plaintiff, to maintain the issue on her part, introduced evidence
showing the death of Mr. Davey, and also certain papers constituting proofs of loss, including the certificate of death of
the deceased by Dr. Rae, the family physician. In this certificate the following questions and answers occur "3. Was
his last illness occasioned, or had his general health been impaired, by any pernicious habits 2 A. He was in the habit of
using stimulants and a great deal of tobacco, probably they
impaired his health." "5. Was his health impaired by intemA. See answer to 3. B. Was his death caused,
perance
directly or indirectly, from intemperance , See answer to 3."
The plaintiff thereupon rested her case.
The defendant introduced the evidence of a large number of
witnesses to prove the breach of the above-mentioned condition
in the policy All of them were associated with him whilst he
was at Alexandria Bay, most of them boatmen engaged in
rowing on the St. Lawrence River, clerks and keepers of hotels,
a bell-boy, the physician who attended him in his last illness,
and two medical experts. The evidence of these witnesses
was to the following effect In the evening of the 24th of
July, 1881, Mr. Davey arrived at Alexandria Bay on the St.
Lawrence River, on his annual fishing excursion to that place,
and put up at the Crossman House. He seemed at that time
to be in delicate health, and one of the witnesses, at least,
testified that he shuffled in his walk while going tip to the
hotel. From that date up until Monday, August the 1st,
,William White, the boatman, testifies that the deceased was
on the river every day with him, from 8 or 9 A.M. until the
middle of the afternoon or in the evening, and that while on
the river the deceased drank about a quart of brandy daily
In addition thereto, according to the testimon'y of the bell-boy
at the hotel, the saloon-keeper and several boatmen, he drank at
the bar of the Crossman House every evening, quite freely, and

sometimes m the morning before breakfast, and frequently
went across the river to Lockport and to another place known
as the Island View 'House, kept by one Theodore Lear, and
drank heavily of brandy at both places, as testified to by the
respective keepers and bar-tenders of those hotels. The bellboy at the Crossman Hlouse testifies that very often during the
period mentioned he had several drinks sent to his room in the
evening and sometimes in the morning, and that on the afternoon of Tuesday, August 2, at the request of Mr. Davey, he
carried two quart bottles of liquor to his room - one of brandy
or whiskey and the other of gin. On going to his room on
the morning of Wednesday, the 3d of August, the bell-boy
says those two 5ottles were empty and Mr. Davey was sitting
in bed in a very weak and nervous condition. his clothing and
the bed clothing spattered with blood, and there was considerable blood in the slop-jar beside the bed. The bell-boy notified
the proprietor of the hotel of the affair, and he, together with
Frank Bruce, a clerk at the hotel, (who was then studying
medicine and has since graduated in that science, and is now a
practising physician,) went to Davey's room. They at once
sent for Dr. L. C. Watson, a practising physician at that place.
Dr. Watson testified that Davey said to him that he had been
cautioned by his family physician that if he persisted in "having these times," he would have hemorrhage of the stomach,
which would probably kill him. And then looking at the
blood, he said "There is the blood, and I suppose it is all up
with me now"
Bruce and Dale also testified that Davey complained of
seeing pitch, fire and smoke in the room when none existed,
and Bruce further testified that Davey imagined that somebody was trying to saw off his limbs, and that there was a
heavy pipe lying across his chest, and exhibited various other
symptoms usual in cases of acute alcoholism or delirium
tremens. At times he was quite violent, called continually for
liquor, but by and by calmed down very materially, so that by
the time his family physician, Dr. Rae, and Mrs. Davey arrived
he had sunk into a state of exhaustion and quietude.
The evidence on the part of the defence tended to show

OCTOBEt TERM, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

that Davey's death was superinduced by an excessive use of
ardent spirits, which brought on delirium tremens, and the
evidence of two physicians who were examined as experts
was to the effect that the symptoms described indicated that
Mr. Davey suffered from delhum tremens, and that any one
drinking brandy to the extent he did, as testified to by the
witnesses for the defence, would greatly impair his health and
bring about death.
The evidence in rebuttal was given by witnesses who had
been acquaintances, neighbors, business associates, intimate
friends, and members of his family, who stated that they were
familiar with his habits of life. Their evidence was to the
effect that no sign of intoxication or intemperate use of liquor
was ever seen by them during a period of many years, immediately preceding his death, though all spoke of his constant
use, in a moderate degree, of alcoholic liquors. The result is
that the evidence of witnesses who were associated with the
deceased at Alexandria Bay is inconsistent with the idea of a,
moderate use of liquor by him, or with any idea other than
that his last illness and death were due to excessive drinking of
alcoholic liquors, whilst on the other hand the evidence of his
neighbors, friends, business associates and family was, though in
one sense, of a negative character, to the effect that his whole
course of conduct and habits were at variance with the course
of life pursued by him just before his death, as testified to by
the witnesses for the defence. One witness only, for the plaintiff, a Mr. Mattoon, an elderly gentleman, saw Davey at
Alexandria Bay in the summer of 1881, before he was taken
violently ill. He did not stop at the same hotel as Davey, but
saw him five or six times for short periods of thirty minutes or
more, between the date of his arrival, July 23, and July 31, at
all of which times he was apparently sober.
Dr. IRae, the family physician, who furnished the certificate
of death, arrived at Alexandria Bay about noon on Friday the
4th, and left about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the following
day, before Davey died. At the trial, among other things, he
testified that when he arrived he found Davey in a dying condition, but when questioned as to the cause of death he ad-

hered to the statements made in the certificate of death furrnshed by him, testifying on this point as follows

"You certified that he was in the habit of using stimulants "
A. Yes, sir. Q. And that was true2 A. Yes, sir. Q. And
by stimulants you wish us to understand alcoholic liquor?
A. Yes, sir. Q. And when you say probably they impaired
his health, that was your opinion at that time2 A. Yes, sir.
Q. You don't deny that it was your judgment that they unpaired his health 2 A. They mean tobacco and liquor together.
Q. I ask you about stimulants, nothing about tobacco. You
don't deny that in your judgment they impaired his health 2
A. I said they probably did. Q. I don't ask you what you
said in your certificate, and if you will pay attention to the
question we will get along faster. You don't deny that it is
your judgment that they impaired his health, do you2 , A. No,
sir. Q. You adhere to the statements that are contained in
the certificate2, A. Yes, sir, as far as I know"
There was also some evidence given by Mrs. Davey, over
the objections of the defendant, to the effect that Mr. Davey
took stimulants upon the advice of a Dr. Kellerman of New
York city, since deceased, quite frequently during the day,
and that, for several years previous to his death, Mr. Davey
had been suffering from lung trouble, at several times having
had hemorrhages.
At the close of the testimony, which was quite voluminous,
the defendant requested the court to direct the jury to bring
in a verdict in its favor, but this the court refused to do, and
the defendant excepted. The jury returned a verdict in favor
of the plaintiff for the full amount of the policy, and, judgment having been entered on the verdict, the defendant prosecuted this writ of error.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The chief difficulty in the way of a connected review of this
case lies in the great number of errors assigned by the plaintiff
in error, embracing exceptions to the admission of evidence
during the progress of the trial, and to the charge of-the court,
and also to refusals to charge as requested. They are thirtysix in number, covering ten pages of the printed record. They
are, however, reduced by the brief of counsel to forty-five
specifications grouped under twelve different headings. As
we cannot discuss them singly, in the order in which they are
presented, without being involved in an entanglement of multiform and somewhat inconsistent propositions, we will endeavor to dispose of the most material points under our own
arrangement.
When the case was here before, speaking of the clause in
the policy which is now in dispute, we said "If the substantial cause of the death of the insured was an excessive use of
alcoholic stimulants, not taken in good faith for medical purposes or under medical advice, his health was impaired by
intemperance, within the meaning of the words Iso far intemperate as to impair his health,' although he may not have had
delirium tremens, and although, previously to his last illness,
he had not indulged m strong drink for such a long period of
time or so frequently as to become habitually intemperate.
Whether death was so caused is a matter to be determined by
the jury under all the evidence." 123 U. S. 743, 744. Accordingly, on this trial of the case, to rebut the evidence offered by
the defence, tending to show an excessive use of liquors on the
part of the deceased, the plaintiff sought to show that the deceased had taken stimulants, at various times, sometimes in
considerable quantities, upon the advice of his physician. The
first, second and third specifications of error are that the court
erred in allowing M rs. Davey to answer certain questions put
to her with reference to the fact of the deceased having taken
stimulants upon the advice of his physician. As the questions
were in proper form, and as such evidence was germane to the
issue, there was no error in- allowing her to answer them. It
was shown that Dr. Kellerman, who prescribed stimulants for
-Mr. Davey during his lifetime, was dead at the time of the

=TNA LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. WARD.
Opimon of the Court.

trial, and, as Mrs. Davey testified that she was present when
the prescription was given and afterwards prepared the stimulants for her husband, in accordance with that prescription,
the evidence was properly admitted.
Without referring to the other exceptions relating to the
evidence, none of which we think were well taken, we will
proceed to the consideration of the specifications of error
which relate to the instructions given and to those refused.
The first specification of error, which we think proper to notice, is that the court erred in refusing to give the following
instruction "To establish the breach of the condition of the
policy, ' become so far intemperate as to impair his health,' it
is not necessary to satisfy the jury that his health was impaired
to the extent of causing death."' It is our opinion that this request was properly refused. The court had already given the
substance of it to the jury, as a fundamental proposition underlying the entire body of the charge, in the following terms
"But this contract was made by the company and Mr. Davey
upon certain expressed conditions, seven in all, which in clear
and positive language limit in various ways the rights and obligations of both the contracting parties. It will be necessary for
you, gentlemen, to consider, however, only one, or, to speak
more accurately, only part of one of these conditions. It is
the third, as you will find them numbered in the body of the
policy or contract, which you will have before you. In that
condition you will find these words 'If the insured shall become so far intemperate as to impair his health or induce delirium tremens, this policy or contract shall become null and
void.' In other words, so far as this suit is concerned, the
contract between the zEtna Life Insurance Company and Mr.
Davey was this For the consideration of the sum of $233.60,
to be paid by Mr. Davey to the insurance company annually
during his life, that company insured his life for ten thousand
dollars, upon the expressed condition, nevertheless, that if Mr.
Davey became so far intemperate as to impair his health, or
became so far intemperate as to induce delirium tremens, then
and in the case of the happening of either of these alternatives
the contract became null and void, and the company would be

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

liable no longer under it." "If the company have satisfied
you that he has done either one or the other -that he has
become so far intemperate as to impair his health, or by his intemperance has induced delirium tremens-a complete defence
to this suit has been made, and your verdict would be for the
defendant." "I think it proper, before I call your attention
to the evidence which has been given, and which I shall do
very briefly, to explain as clearly as I can what is meant by
the words, 'so far intemperate as to impair health or induce
delirium tremens.'" "Mr. Davey agrees that he will not become so far intemperate as what 9, Why, become so far intemperate as to impair his health, or so far intemperate as to
induce delirium tremens. If impairment of health or if delirium tremens was caused -by or followed his intemperance, then
the degree of intemperance -which has been forbidden by this
condition has been reached. Thus you will perceive that if a
single debauch, lasting for a period of a few days, or it may
be a single day only, results in the impairment of health or in
delirium tremens, it will be clearly that intemperance which is
positively forbidden." After this full and explicit instruction
there was certainly no error in refusing the request to repeat
it in different language.
Five of the exceptions relate to the charge given by the
court with reference to the liquor taken by the deceased on
the advice of his physician, and four relate to the refusal of
the court to charge as requested by the plaintiff in error on the
same point. Those parts of the charge that are excepted
to are as follows. "If the jury should believe that the efficient
controlling cause of the death of William A. Davey was the
excessive and continuous use of strong drinks for several days
and nights immediately preceding his death, yet if they believe that it was taken in good faith for medical purposes
under medical advice, such use was not a violation of that condition of the policy which declares that it shall be null and
void if he shall become so far intemperate as to impair his
health or induce delirium tremens." "Whether the health of
William A. Davey was impaired by the use of alcoholic stunulants not taken in good faith for medicinal purposes or under

,ETNA LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. WARD.
Opiniou of the Court.

medical advice, is a matter to be determined by the jury under
all the evidence." "If, on the other hand, the testimony
does not so satisfy you, [that Mr. Davey became so intemperate in the use of alcoholic spirits as to impair his health, or
that, at Alexandria Bay, in 1881, he indulged in the use of
alcoholic liquor to such an extent as to induce delirium tremens,]
or if you are convinced that all the liquor which he used was
used in good faith, under medical advice and for medical purposes, as claimed by the plaintiff, then your verdict should be
for the plaintiff." "It is in evidence that Mr. Davey did take
alcoholic stimulants under medical advice. If his taking them
was only under such advice and only in such quantities as prescribed by [his] physician, even if impairment of health followed, yet the policy would not become void." "If, from all
the testimony in this case, you cqnclude that Mr. Davey's condition in this respect was produced by a strict, fair and bona
ftde following of Dr. Kellerman's prescription, then that impairment of health, if there was any, which it is alleged
existed, known as cirrhosis of the liver, does not avoid this
policy"
There certainly can be no objection taken to these instructions when considered m the abstract, nor do we think there is
anything in the context of the charge that in any degree militates against this view On the contrary, in immediate connection with the last paragraph of the charge above objected
to, the court called particular attention to the prescription of
Dr. lKellerman, as testified to by Mrs. Davey, and further
stated "That prescription was, as Mrs. Davey gives it to us,
to take an egg with sherry wine in the morning and a Inilk
punch before retiring at night, and brandy and water, if he
needed it, during the day I leave it entirely with you to say
whether, if you believe the witnesses of the defendant and
some of the witnesses for the plaintiff as to the habit of Mr.
Davey in the use of intoxicating liquor for many years prior
to his death, you can conscientiously say that such was a bona
Jide following of medical advice, otherwise the condition is
broken if the impairment of health follows." These charges
were not detrimental to the defendant, as to the law of the
case, and fairlv put the case to the jury upon this point.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The refusals to charge, as above specified, were justified, because the effect of the charges as requested would have been
to utterly nullify those portions of the charge above set forth,
which we have just stated properly put before the jury the
law of the case. In that connection the court went to the
uttermost limit it could go in the premises, by saying that
"there was nothing in the case, so far as I remember, to justify
the jury in finding that the quantity of liquor which Davey,
according to the evidence of some witnesses, drank at Alexandria Bay in the summer of 1881, was taken in good faith, for
medicinal purposes." On this branch of the case, therefore,
we conclude there was no error on the part of the court below
in the conduct of the trial. We think the law, as enunciated
by us when the case was here before, was so stated to the jury
that the defendant could not have been prejudiced, in any particular.
Sixteen of the specifications of error are but variant forms
of the motion made at the close of the testimony to have the
court direct the jury to bring in a verdict for the defendant.
It is not necessary to consider them in detail. There was evidence in the case going to discredit, in some particulars, the
evidence offered by the defence to prove the breach of the
condition in the policy, and it was eminently proper that all of
that evidence should be taken into consideration and weighed
by the jury, under proper instructions from the court, in arriving at their verdict.
It is claimed, however, that on the merits of the defence
the action of the court below was erroneous both as to what
it charged and as to its refusals to charge, and those objections form the basis of seven other specifications of error.
The charge of the court on the merits of the defence was to
the effect that the burden of proof was on the defendant to
establish its defence satisfactorily in the minds of the jury
In respect to this, after referring impartially, and somewhat
in detail, to the evidence, the court said "If, on the other
hand, the testimony does not so satisfy you, or if you are convinced that all the liquor which he used was used in good faith,
under medical advice and for medical purposes, as claimed by

.MTNA LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. WARD.
Opinon of the Court.

the plaintiff, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. In
weighing this testimony I desire you to be guided by two
principles which control in this case, and the first is this
That the burden of proof is upon the defendant in this case that is, the obligation is upon it to prove the facts relied upon
by it as a defence. The plaintiff is not called upon to prove
that these facts did not exist. It is its duty to present to you
evidence which is to satisfy your mind. Such evidence need
not be so convincing as to make the effect beyond reasonable
doubt, but the weight of the testimony must decidedly preponderate on the side of the defendant. The other principle
is this You are to be governed, as I have said, by the weight
of evidence. INow, the evidence in the case is of two kinds,
positive and negative, and you must distinguish between them.
If a number of credible witnesses have testified that they
have frequently seen a party intoxicated or visibly under the
influence of strong drink, their testimony is not to be rejected
because an equal number of like credible witnesses testify
that they never saw the party in such a condition. The testimony m the one case is positive, in the other case it is negative, and both statements may be true. The witnesses for the
plaintiff say that they never saw Mr. Davey intoxicated or so
under the influence of liquor as not to be able to attend to his
business. This testimony of itself does not negative or overcome the positive testimony of those who declared, under oath,
that they had seen him intoxicated. You must weigh the testimony as a whole, and let the result of your deliberations be
such as commends itself to sound reason and conscientious
judgment."
In our opinion this charge of the court, with the exception
of the statement that "the weight of the testimony must
decidedly preponderate on the side of the defendant," (which
will be noticed hereafter,) was, to say the least, quite as
favorable to the defendant as it had the right to demand.
The special charges prayed, so far as they were in accordance
with law, were embraced in the charge as given.
A few of those specifications of error, however, require
special mention. One of them grows out of a request to

charge made by the plaintiff, to wit, that "if those opinions
(of physicians) are founded on testimony giving what is called
the history of the case, the jury must determine whether that,
history is true. Therefore, if the jury do not credit the story
of William White and Andrew Duclone, whose relation is.
stated to have been given to Dr. Watson, the jury have the
right to reject his diagnosis, and they have the right, anyhow,
if they do not confide, under all the evidence, in his skill and
experience in cases of this sort." The court gave that charge
as follows. "The first part of that charge is, that these
opinions are founded upon testimony giving what is called the
history of the case, and you must determine whether that.
history is true. You must determine whether the facts upon
which the hypothetical questions are based have been proved
or not to your satisfaction. I also charge you that you have
the right, if you do not confide in Dr. Watson's skill and experience, under the evidence in this case, to reject his diagnosis." The exception is to these words: "I also charge you
that you have the right, if you do not confide in Dr. Watson's
skill and experience, under the evidence in this case, to reject
his diagnosis."
It is not conceived that there is any error in that part of the
charge. The jury were the judges of the credibility of the
witnesses White and Duclone, and in weighing their testimony
had the right to determine how much dependence was to be
placed upon it. There are many things sometimes in the conduct of a witness upon the stand, and sometimes in the mode
in which his answers are drawn from him through the questioning of counsel, by which a jury are to be guided in determining the weight and credibility of his testimony That
part of every case, such as the one at bar, belongs to the jury,
who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of
men, and so long as we have jury trials they should not be
disturbed in their possession of it, except in a case of manifest
and extreme abuse of their function. Neither do we consider that there was any error in that part of the charge
specifically excepted to therein. The jury were not told that

IETNA LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. WARD.
Opinion of the Court.

they could reject the evidence of Dr. Watson, but simply his
diagnosis of the case, that is, his conclusion as to the nature of
the disease from the various symptoms detailed by him. It
may be true that Dr. Watson was fully as competent to
diagnose the disease, if not more so, than the jury But the
province of the jury was to determine if the deceased died
from the effects of acute alcoholism or delirium tremens, as
claimed by the defendant, and in arriving at their conclusion
they were required to weigh the evidence bearing upon that
issue. The evidence of Dr. Watson was relevant and tended
to prove the defence, but the weight to be given it lay with
the jury It was not the province of the court to direct the
jury to accept the diagnosis of the case made by Dr. Watson.
To have done so would have been to reject all the evidence
offered by the plaintiff tending to establish a contrary conclusion, and would have had the effect to direct the jury to
return a verdict for the defendant. We think the court committed no error in this particular.
Two of the specifications of error relate to the charge of the
court, and its refusal to charge as requested, on the question
as to whether Mr. Davey's death was occasioned by exposure
to the sun, or sunstroke. The court was requested to charge,
in this connection, that "there is nothing in the case to justify
the jury in finding that Davy, in the summer of 1881, had a
sunstroke." The court refused to give that charge in so many
words, but said "You will remember that counsel in summing up for the plaintiff alluded to certain symptoms, which
were proved, which he claimed were evidences of sunstroke.
There certaitily has been no one who testified here that Mr.
Davey had a sunstroke, in those words, but you are the judges
of the evidence, as I have stated before, to say whether he was
suffering from exposure to the sun or sunstroke, or whether he
was suffering, as the other witnesses testify, from alcoholism or
the other diseases named. Otherwise I decline to charge as
asked. This leaves the matter entirely with you." We think
the charge as given was as favorable to the defendant as it
had the right to demand. It left the question to the jury,
and that was eminently proper.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The most important specification of error in the entire list
is as follows "The court erred in charging the jury that
' the weight of the testimony must decidedly preponderate on
the side of the defendant.'" Objection is particularly made to
the use of the word "decidedly" in this connection. The
argument is, that the effect of that part of the charge was to
direct the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff, unless the
evidence introduced by the defendant to establish its defence
should satisfy them, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defence had been made out. The phrase "decidedly preponderate" is not technically exact, with respect to the weight and
quantity of evidence necessary and proper to justify a verdict
in civil cases. If, therefore, this clause of the charge stood
isolated from any other part of it, bearing upon the same
subject matter, there would be serious objection to it. But we
think the immediate context, as above quoted, shows that no
such meaning can be fairly derived from it as is claimed by
the defendant. On the contrary, such meaning is excluded in
the same sentence, where the jury were told that "such evidence need not be so convincing as to make the effect beyond
reasonable doubt," and then immediately follows the clause
objected to. We think the clause, when taken in connection
with the whole tenor and effect of the entire charge, and
especially in view of the immediate context, could not have
misled the jury in the premises.
Eight other specifications of error relate to the effect to be
given to the certificate of death furnished by Dr. Rae, the
defendant contending that such certificate was of itself Mnma
facme evidence of the fact that the deceased came to his death
from the effects of alcoholic stimulants, etc., and that that
certificate must be overcome by the plaintiff to justify a recovery by her. On this point the court charged the jury as
follows: "Now, gentlemen, as a matter of law, I charge you
that this certificate is not to be taken or accepted by you as
conclusive evidence of the truth of the facts therein stated,
nor is the plaintiff bound by this statement or estopped from
proving to your satisfaction a different cause of death. It is
entitled to the weight which you would give an opinion of a

learned physician, as to the cause of his death, who saw the
person spoken of shortly before his death, and who had per,sonal knowledge of the person for some time previous to his
death. Especially must that weight be given to this statement
when, as in this case, the person who made the certificate, Dr.
Rae, testifies before you that he adheres now to the opinion
he expressed in that paper." And in the refusals to charge
:specifically on the question, as prayed by the defendant, the
court did not depart from this general charge in any material
respect. We think the charge as given embodies the law of
the case on the point at issue, and, therefore, that the objections to it are without avail.
Upon the whole case we do not think that the defendant
-was in any manner prejudiced by any of the rulings of the
court on the trial of the case. It may be that if we were to
usurp the functions of the jury and determine the weight to
be given to the evidence, we might arrive at a different conclusion. But that is not our province on a writ of error. In
such a case we are confined to the consideration of exceptions,
taken at the trial, to the admission or rejection of evidence
and to the charge of the court and its refusals to charge. We
have no concern with questions of fact, or the weight to be
given to the evidence which was properly admitted. Minor
