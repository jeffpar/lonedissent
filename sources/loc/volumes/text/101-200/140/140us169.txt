UNITED STATES v. VAN DUZEE.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT

COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.
No. 1244. Argued March 12, 13, 1891.-Decided May 11,
1891.
A clerk of a Circuit or District Court of the United States, receiving papers
sent up in criminal cases by the commissioners before whom the examinations were had, may file them in the order and as they come from
the commissioners, and is entitled to his fee for filing each such paper.
He may also charge for filing oaths, bonds and appointments of deputy
marshals, jury commissioners, bailiffs, district attorneys and their assistants, and further for recording them if required by order of court or
by custom to do so; but not for administering the oaths of office to
them or preparing their official bonds.
He is also entitled to his legal charges for approving the accounts of such
officers under the act of February 22, 1875, 18 Stat. 333, c. 95.
He is also entitled to charge for furnishing a copy of an indictment to the
defendant when ordered to do so by the court; but not otherwise.
He is also entitled to a fee for filing criminal cases sent up by a commissioner, but not for docketing the same unless indictment is found.
When the Treasury Department requires copies of orders by payment by the
marshal of sums due to jurors and witnesses to be authenticated by the
seal of the court, the clerk is entitled to his fee for affixing it; but not
otherwise.
He is not entitled to a fee for entering an order for trial and recording a
verdict in a criminal case, that charge being covered by the fee " for
making dockets and indices, issuing venire, taxing costs," etc.
Charges for filing precipes for bench warrants are proper; but no such
precipe is required after sentence, the sentence being in itself an order
for a mittimus.
When it is the practice in a district to require records to be made up in
criminal cases, the clerk is entitled to charge for incorporating in it the
transcript from the commissioner.
When, in a district there is a rule of court that the clerk, in issuing subpcenas in criminal cases, shall make copies to be left with witnesses, he
is entitled to compensation for such copies.

THIS was an action brought to recover for services as clerk
of the Circuit and Districts Courts of the United States for
the Northern District of Iowa, the items of which were
annexed to the petition. Judgment having been rendered in

B~oww delivered the opinion of the court.

This account consists of ninety-nine separate items, which
we proceed to consider in the order in which they appear in
the demurrer filed in the court below, and in the opinion of
the court.
1. The first series of items embraces the fees charged in
forty-five criminal cases, for filing the papers certified up by
the commissioners before whom the examinations were had.
In the majority of the cases the number of papers filed by the
clerk ranged from four to six, in a few they were eight in
number, and in one sixteen. In the whole forty-five cases
there were filed 267 papers. By Rev Stat. ยง 828, the clerk
is allowed ten cents "for filing and entering every declaration,
plea or other paper." By section 1011 the commissioners of
the Circuit Court are required to return copies of the process
as speedily as may be into the clerk's office of the court to
which the defendant is bound over to appear, together with
the recognizances of the witnesses for their appearance to
testify in the case. In preparing the transcript of proceedings
for transmission from a lower to a higher court it isusual and
proper to attach the papers together, with a suitable endorsement indicating their character as a transcript, and to treat
them as one paper, and if in such case the original be sent up,
the qame course should be pursued. If such papers are sent
up separately, they are liable to be mixed with papers subsequently filed in the case and produce confusion. Such transcript or papers are properly sent up as soon as the case is
filished before the commissioner, and before action is taken

UNITED STATES v. VAN DUZEE.
Opinion of the Court.

by the grand jury

The accounting officers of the Treasury

in this case seemed to assume either that the clerk should
select certain papers and file those only, or should fasten them
together and file the bundle as one paper. The clerk, however, is not responsible for the manner in which such papers

are transmitted by the commissioner, nor is it his duty to
select out the complaint, the recognizance or any other particular paper, and say that that only should be filed. Because
the statute allows the fee "for filing and entering," it does
not necessarily follow that before he is entitled to the fee he
must enter every paper that he files upon his court docket,
he may make the entry upon any proper book kept for the
purpose. His duty is discharged by filing them as they are
received, and the exception to his charge therefor is accordingly overruled.
2. The charges for filing the oaths, bonds and appointments
of deputy marshals, jury commissioners, bailiffs, district attorneys and their assistants, are properly made against the government and should be allowed, and where, by order of the
court or custom of the office, it is the practice to require such
documents to be recorded or entered upon the journal, the
clerk's fees for such services are also properly chargeable. But
the expense of taking the oaths and executing the proper
bonds is not so chargeable, since it is the duty of persons
receiving appointments from the government to prepare and
tender to the proper officer the oaths and bonds required by
law, in other words, to qualify themselves for the office.
What shall be done with such qualifying papers does not concern them, their own duty is discharged by the tender of
such papers properly executed according to law
3. The same principle applies to the charges for approving
the accounts of these officers. By the act of February 22,
1875, 18 Stat. 333, c. 95, "before any bill of costs shall be
taxed by any judge or other officer, or any account payable
out of the money of the United States shall be allowed by any
officer of the Treasury, in favor of clerks, marshals or district
attorneys, the party claiming such account shall render the
same, with the vouchers and items thereof, to a United States

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opimon of the Court.

Circuit or District Court, and in presence of the district attorney or his sworn assistant, whose presence shall be noted on
the record, prove in open court, to the satisfaction of the
court, by his own oath or that of other persons having knowledge of the facts, to be attached to such account, that the
services therein charged have been actually and necessarily
performed as therein stated, and that the disbursements
charged have been fully paid in lawful money, and the court
shall thereupon cause to be entered of record an order approving or disapproving the account, as may be according to law,
and just. United States commissioners shall forward their
accounts, duly verified by oath, to the district attorneys of
their respective districts, by whom they shall be submitted for
approval in open court, and the court shall pass upon the same
in the manner aforesaid." It follows from this section that
the officer has performed his duty by "rendering" his account
in proper form to the court, with the proper affidavit or oath
in support of the actual and necessary performance of the services therein charged. He is not concerned with the method
of verification adopted by the government for its own convenience and protection, and is no more liable for the expense of
entering the orders of approval of such accounts, or for the
certified copies of such orders, than he is for the expense of
auditing such accounts at the Treasury Department. The
statute imposes upon the court to a certain extent the duties
of an auditing officer, but such duties are imposed not for the
beneftt of the claimant, who is entitled to- his statutory compensation for the services rendered, but for the protection of
the government, and the expenses attendant thereon are
proper charges against the government.
4. For copies of indictments furnished to defendants in
criminal cases. By the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution,
"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to
have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence." By
ยง 1033, where a person is indicted for a capital offence a copy

DUZEE.

Opinion of the Court.

of the indictment and list of the jurors and witnesses shall be
delivered to him at least two entire days before his trial.
There would appear to be a negative pregnant here, and it
has accordingly been held that in cases not capital the prisoner
is not entitled to a copy of the indictment at government expense. Untted States v Becford, 4 Blatchford, 337, United
States v- Hare, 2 Wheeler, 0. 0. 283, 288. Nor is he entitled
to a list of witnesses and jurors. Unded States v Williams,
4 Cranch, C. 0. 372, United States v ]food, 3 Wash. 0. C.
440.
There is no other statutory provision for carrying out the constitutional obligation of the government to inform the prisoner
of the nature and cause of the accusation, or for summoning
witnesses, or procuring the assistance of counsel, except that
by ยง 878 indigent defendants are entitled to have their witnesses subpoenaed at the expense of the government. There
is, however, no general obligation on the part of the government either to furnish copies of indictments, summon witnesses
or retain counsel for defendants or prisoners. The object of
the constitutional provision was merely to secure those rights
which by the ancient rules of the common law had been denied
to them, but it was not contemplated that this should be done
at the expense of the government. We have no doubt, however, of the power of the court to order a copy of the indictment to be furnished upon the request of the defendant, and
at the expense of the government, and, when such order is
made, the clerk is entitled to his fee for the copy In many
cases, however, the defendant does not desire a copy, or pleads
guilty to the indictment upon its being read to him, and in
such cases there is no propriety in forcing a copy upon him
and charging the government with the expense. This appears
to have been the ruling of the court below, and we see no
valid objection to it.
5. For docketing, indexing and taxing costs in nine cases
sent up from the commissioner's office, in which the defendant
was bound over to appear to answer an indictment by the
grand jury The grand jury, however, ignored the bills, and,
of course, no indictment was ever filed. The fee bill allows

OCTOBER TERM; 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

"for making dockets and indexes, taxing costs and other
services in a cause which is dismissed or discontinued,
one dollar." The real question is, whether papers so sent up
and filed can be said to constitute of themselves a "cause")
which should be docketed. While it is true that a crimnal
cause is begun in the commissioner's office by the filing of a
complaint and the issuing of a warrant, it is equally true that
there is no "cause" in the District or Circuit Court, within
the meaning of the law, until an indictment or information is
filed. Copies of the process before the commissioner are required by section 1014 to be returned as speedily as may be
into the clerk's office of the court, together with the recogmzances of the witnesses, etc. The filing of such transcript,
however, is not the institution of a suit. The object of the
provision seems to be to inform the district attorney of the
fact that the defendant has been held to bail or committed to
await the action of the grand jury - a proceeding which may
be very necessary where the commissioner resides at a distance,
and to enable him to prepare an indictment. For filing such
papers we have held the clerk to be entitled to a fee, but it is
not usual or proper to docket cases as such until the grand
jury or district attorney has taken affirmative action in regard
to them.
6. For seals affixed to copies of orders for payment by the
marshal of sums due to jurors and witnesses. Section 855
requires the marshal, upon the order of the court to be entered
upon its minutes, to pay to jurors and witnesses all fees to
which they appear by such order to be entitled, which sum is
to be allowed him at the Treasury in his accounts. If the
officers of the Treasury Department require a copy of such
order to be authenticated, not only by the signature of the
clerk, but by the seal of the court, then, of course, the clerk is
entitled to charge for affixing such seal. It is usual, however,
as between officers of the same court, and between such officers
and those of the Treasury Department, to accept the signatures
of each other as genuine, and under such circumstances the
clerk has no right to impose the unnecessary burden of a seal.
Jones v Unsted States, 39 Fed. Rep. 410, Singleton v Unzted

UITITED STATES v. VAN DUZEE.
Opinion of the Court.

States, 22 0. C1. 118. The question is not so much what the
law requires as a sufficient authentication of the copy of an
order, for formal proof of such order in a case upon trial, but
what method of authentication the department requires. The
department has the right to waive the formal proof which
would be required in a court of law
7. Objection is also made to fees for entering orders for
trial, and recording the verdict, in thirty-eight criminal cases,
the claim being that such services are included in the fee
allowed "for making dockets and indexes, issuing venire,
taxing costs and all other services, on the trial or argument
of a cause, where issue is joined and testimony given, three
dollars." The argument is made that the entry of an order
for trial, and the recording of the verdict, are not services
rendered upon the trial and argument of the cause, since the
order for trial precedes the trial, and the verdict follows it.
Referring to the clause in question, however, to determine
what shall be deemed services on the trial of a case, we find
that issuing venires and taxing costs are included among such
services. The former of these certainly, precedes the actual
trial, and the latter follows not only the verdict, but the judgment. We think it follows from this that the docket fee was
intended to include these services. If it does not, it is not
easy to say what it was intended to cover. (See p. 199 Post.)
8. Charges for filing precipes for bench warrants are proper.
It is not always that the district attorney desires the arrest of
the defendant immediately upon the indictment being returned
to the court, and it is proper that the clerk should wait for
instructions before issuing the bench warrant. These instructions are given in the form of a precipe, and for filing such
precipe the clerk is entitled to his fee. It appearing upon the
finding of the court below that the filing of precipes is in accordance with the settled practice of the court, there is no
just reason why the clerk is not entitled to his fee therefor.
With regard to mittimuses after sentence, no such precipe
is required, the sentence of the court being that the defendant
"be committed" until the fine be paid, or the terms of the
sentence otherwise complied with. This is itself an order for

OCTOBER TERMI,

Opinion of the Court.

a mittimus, and the district attorney has no right to interfere
with the execution of the sentence. From the moment the
sentence is pronounced the case passes beyond the control or
discretion of the district attorney It is the mandate of the
court, and is obligatory upon all its officers.
9. Charges for incorporating in the final record the transcript from the commissioner. There is no statute prescribing
what record shall be kept by the clerk, or how it shall be kept
in criminal proceedings. Properly speaking, as we have
already held, the transcript from the commissioner's office is
no part of the case in the Circuit or District Court, but the
court, in this district, has adopted a rule that, "in all criminal
cases, unless otherwise specially ordered, the final record
entered therein shall include the order made by the commissioner binding the party to appear before the grand jury, if
any such was made, the presentment therein, the -bench
warrant and return, the plea of defendant, the verdict of the
jury, and the final order and sentence of the court thereon."
This rule, of course, is obligatory upon the clerk, and for his
services in connection- therewith he is entitled to compensation.
He is, therefore, entitled to recover for so much of the record
as includes "the order of the commissioner binding the party
to appear before the grand jury" It is not the practice in all
districts to require a record to be made up in criminal cases,
but, as it seems to be the practice in Iowa, we see no objection
to the allowance of the item.
10. To the allowance for copies of subpcenas furnished to
the marshal for services upon witnesses, objection is made
upon the ground that by section 829, prescribing the fees of
the marshal, he is allowed "for serving a writ of subpcena on
a witness, fifty cents, and no further compensation shall be
allowed for any copy, summons or notice for a witness."
This, however, was intended to apply only to the marshal,
and when, as in this district, there is a rule of the court that
the clerk in issuing subpoenas in criminal cases shall make
copies to be left with witnesses, he is clearly entitled to compensation for such copies. When the clerk performs a service
in obedience to an order of the court, he is as much entitled to

Statement of the Case.

compensation as if he were able to put his finger upon a particular clause of a statute authorizing compensation for such
services.
These are the only questions considered in the opinion of the
court below to which exception was taken, and in the absence
of an assignment of errors we do not find it necessary to discuss all the items of the account.
The judgment of the Dtstrict Court must be reversed and
vacated, and the case remanded wzth directions to enter a
new dudgment in conformity to this opznzon.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
A[DDLE DISTRICT OF ATA

AMA.

No. 339. Submitted April 22,1891.-Decded May 11, 1891.

Whether a complaint in a criminal proceeding is so unnecessarily prolix that
the commissioner who drew it should not be allowed charges for it in
excess of three folios, is a question of fact upon which the decision of
the court below will be accepted.
I
It is within the discretion of a commissioner of a Circuit Court of the
United States in Alabama, to cause more than one warrant against the
same party for a violation of the same section of the Revised Statutes
to be issued, and when the court below approves his accounts containing charges for such issues, it is conclusive upon the accounting officers
of the Treasury that the discretion was properly exercised.
The acknowledg nent of a recognizance in a criminal case by principal and
sureties is a single act, for which only a single fee is chargeable.

Tins was a consolidation of three actions to recover for services as commissioner of the Circuit Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The services are admitted to have been
rendered, and the accounts therefor approved by the proper
court under the act of February 25, 1875, 18 Stat. 333. The
United States interposed a demurrer to the petition, upon the
hearing of which judgment was entered in favor of the petiVOL. CxL-12
