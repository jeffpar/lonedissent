KOKOMO FENCE MACHINE COMPANY v. KITSELMAN.
CERTIORAiRI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 148. Argued January 22, 1903.-Decided MIarch 23, 1903.
Where the patents sued on are not pioneer patents and do not embody a
primary invention, but are only improvements on the prior art and defendants' machines can be differentiated, the charge of infringement cannot be
maintained.
In view of the state of the art, and what passed in the Patent Office, this
court cannot regard the Kitselman patent of January 18, 1887, for wire
fabric machines, as a pioneer patent, but its claims must be limited in
their scope to the actual combination of essential parts as shown and cannot be construed to cover other combinations of elements of different
construction and arrangement.
The same rule applies to the other patents in suit, and tested by it infringement was not made out.

THIS was a suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Indiana for infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, 9,
10, 11, 15 and 20 of letters patent No. 356,322, issued January 18, 1887, to Alva L. Kitselman and Davis M. Kitselman
for an improvement in wire fabric machines; of claims 1 and 2
of letters patent No. 289,507, issued December 4, 1883, to IV.
J. Davisson for an improved machine for making wire fabrics;
of claims 2, 3 and 4 of letters patent No. 357,067, issued February 1, 1887, to Theodore Al. Connor for improvement in
machines for forming netted wire fabrics; and of claims 1 and
10 of letters patents No. 505,607, issued September 26, 1893, to
John C. Pope, for wire fabric machines.
Defendant denied patentable novelty of each of the patents,
and also denied infringement, and alleged that it constructed
its wire fabrics as licensee under and pursuant of letters patent No. 502,025, issued to W. D. Whitney, December 24, 1895,
for improvements in wire fabric machines.
The cause was heard by District Judge Baker, who held

Opinion of the Court.

that the claims of the four patents sued on were for specific
constructions, which defendant did not use, and that there
was no infringement of either of the letters patent, and dismissed the bill. The case was carried to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that
court, one of its members dissenting, reversed the decree, and
held that the defendant had infringed the first, second, eleventh and fifteenth claims of the patent issued to the Kitselmans. 108 Fed. Rep. 632.
The writ of certiorari was granted on the petition of the
Kokomo Fence Company, and afterwards the cross writ on
the petition of the Kitselmans. The Machine Company alleged
error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining and
finding infringement of the Kitselman patent, and the Kitselmans alleged error in that court in not sustaining and finding
infringement of the Davisson, Connor and Pope patents.

MR. CHIEF JUSTicE FULLER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The Circuit Court was of opinion that neither of complainants' patents was a pioneer invention ; that they were all
merely improvements on the prior art, and to be construed in
that light; that complainants could not be treated on the basis
that they or their assignors were the first to make a portable
machine for weaving wire fencing fabric in the field, which
claim had been distinctly made by complainants, rejected by
the Patent Office, and the claim thereupon withdrawn. In
its judgment, complainants and defendant contended as to infringement on an equal field, the presumption of the validity of
complainants' patents being met by the presumption of the validity of the patent to Whitney. And, taking up complainants'
patents seriatim, the Circuit Court held that the differences
between their machines and defendant's machine were not

mere colorable invasions by the latter, and that the identity of
means and of operation essential to infringement were lacking.
The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the Circuit
Court that the case turned upon the question whether the patents sued on embodied a pioneer invention; that if complainants' invention was not of a primary character, a substantial departure from the machines of the prior art, defendant's machine
was so sulficiently differentiated that the claim of infringement
could not be maintained; while, on the other hand,if complainants' patents "were the first to give to the world a workable,
portable machine for weaving wire fences in the field-a machine distinctly creating a new product-and aptly embody in
their specifications and claims the mechanical arrangements
that bring about such a result, the decree below is erroneous."
The opinion was preceded by an extended statement of facts,
which gave the specifications of the Davisson patent of December 4, 18S3, and certain of the accompanying figures, together
with the second and third claims, alleged to be infringed ; also
"the pertinent drawings and specifications of the Kitselman
patent," and the claims alleged to be infringed, which were as
follows:
"1. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of sectional twisters,
each of which comprises a central section for carrying a warpwire, and having rotary movement imparted thereto, and the
shifting sections for carrying the weft-wire, and receiving rotary
motion from the central section to form the twist, substantially
as and for the purpose herein described.
"2 . In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series of
sectional twisters geared together for simultaneous rotation, and
each comprising a central portion movable only on its axis and
side portions capable of a compound movement-that of rotation on their axes-and of a shifting longitudinal movement,
substantially as described, for the purpose set forth."
" 9. In a wire-fabric machine, the series of sectional twisters,
comprising the central and side sections, the central section of
each twister being geared to the twister adjacent thereto for
simultaneous operation, substantially as described, for the purpose set forth.

Opinion of the Court.

In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series of

twisters geared directly together for simultaneous operation,
and each comprising a central section and the side section, each
side section carrying a spool or reel for the wire, substantially
as described, for the purpose set forth.
"11. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of twisters connected
for simultaneous operation, and each consisting of a central
section and the side section, in combination with the spools
carried by the side sections, the central section of each twister
being provided with a longitudinal opening for the passage
therethrough of the warp-wire, substantially as described."
"15. In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series
of rotary twisters geared directly together for simultaneous
operation, each twister having a central section capable of
rotary movement only, and two side sections which are capable
of a shifting movement independently of the central section in
opposite directions simultaneously, whereby the said shifting
sections of one twister are adjusted to register with the central
sections of twisters on opposite sides of the same, substantially
as described, for the purpose set forth."
"20. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of sectional twisters,
each comprising a central section, the central sections being
geared together to be simultaneously rotated on their axes, and
the shifting side sections adapted to align with the central
sections to be rotated therewith, substantially as described, for
the purpose set forth."
The drawings and specifications of the Connor and Pope
patents were not set out because unnecessary in the view taken
of the case. Both these patents were issued subsequently to
the Kitselman patent.
The drawings and specifications of the patent to Whitney of
December 24, 1895, were then given.
The statement further set forth "the essential drawings and
specifications of letters patent No. 10,7i3, granted John Nesmith, April 4, 1854, and referred to in the opinion as most
adequately representing one branch of the prior art," namely,
as stated by the court, loom machines by which wire netting
was made in the factory, and then transferred to the field; and

also Figure 2 of the drawings of the Middaugh and Wilcox
patent of December 23, 1884, that patent being regarded as
"the best example of the second branch of the prior art," field
machines which constructed the fence in situ.
The statement is given in full, with eleven pages of drawings
in the report of the case, 108 Fed. Rep. 632.
The Kitselman and Pope patents described portable machines.
The Davisson and Connor patents described stationary machines. The Kitselman and Pope patents were intended to be
operated by hand and the Davisson and Connor patents were
intended to be operated by power. But the essentials of the
mechanism were not dependent upon the circumstance of their
being embodied in either a stationary or a portable machine,
or in a power or a hand machine. Complainants' leading expert testified that "the essentials of the invention described in
the several claims here in suit are not dependent on their use
in a stationary or portable machine, or in a power or hand
machine, or upon their capacity to weave a fabric into which
slats may or may not be used, or upon their capacity to weave
a fabric of any special size of mesh."
In the specification of the Kitselman patent the inventor
said: "The primary object I have in view in my invention is
to provide a simple and easily operated machine of the class
named which can be adapted for use in the open field or other
place for the construction of fences, as well as a stationary or
fixed machine for the manufacture of wire fabric." And also:
"I may either construct a portable machine as shown in the
accompanying drawings, to work in the open field or other
place, or dispose the parts in a horizontal instead of a vertical
position, and mount the same on suitable bearings and legs to
provide a stationary machine for indoor use."
The Middaugh and Wilcox patent of December 23, 1884, was
a patent for a "Portable Fence Machine," described in the
claims as "a portable machine for constructing wire-and-picket
fences" and "a portable fencing machine." Longitudinal pairs
of wires were intertwisted with vertical slats inserted between
the twists, the wires passing through tubes or spindles in the
frame of the machine, which moved along the wires as the fence
was formed,

Opinion of the Court.

In the Xitselman specifications and drawings, plans of picket
and slat fencing and of the common form of wood fence held
together by wires, as made by that machine, were shown. The
Middaugh and Wilcox machine made wire and picket fence.
The Kitselman machine made diamond mesh, and wire and
picket, fence. But the diamond mesh fabric was old, as shown
not only in the Davisson patent but in many others antedating
those in suit, as, for instance, that of Nesmith of April 4, 1854.
The diamond mesh fabric had been woven while the machine
was in a standing position. The Middaugh and Wilcox patent
made wire and picket fence in the field. Kitselman converted
the stationary into a portable machine by setting it on end and
mounting it on a truck; and he converted the portable machine,
as he himself says, by disposing the parts "in a horizontal instead of a vertical position," and mounting " the same on suitable bearings to provide a stationary machine for indoor use."
The mechanism and operation were the same. Whatever its
merits, it was not in itself primary invention to mount a machine
for making diamond mesh fencing on a truck, and using it in the
field, as the old machine had been used to make wire and picket
fences. The getting up and walking was not new, though the
machine may have gone at a better gait and made a better fence.
When Kitselman made his original application, his nineteenth
claim read: "In a wire-fabric machine the combination of a
track, a carrying frame geared to the track and, having the
twisting devices and the reels, and pawl and ratchet mechanism for feeding the frame and its devices, substantially as described, for the purpose set forth." This claim was rejected by
the Patent Office on reference to the Fultz patent of May 13,
1884, and the Watson patent of July 21, 1885.
Fultz's was a patent for "an upright machine for making or
weaving fence composed of wire and pickets, and may be used,
movably, along the line where the fence is to be made, or stationary."
Watson's was a patent for a wire fence machine, the invention relating "to that class of fence-machines in which the pickets and wires are bound together and the fence put up in one
operation."

Kitselnan acquiesced in the rejection and withdrew his nineteenth original claim, and cannot now reasonably claim a construction which would protect his machine as a pioneer field
machine.
The first, second, eleventh and fifteenth claims of the Kitselman patent were held by the Circuit Court of Appeals to be
infringed. We repeat these claims as follows:
"1. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of sectional twisters,
each of which comprises a central section for carrying a warpwire, and having rotary movement imparted thereto, and the
shifting sections for carrying the weft-wire, and receiving rotary motion from the central section to form the twist, substantially as and for the purpose herein described.
"2. In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series of
sectional twisters geared together for simultaneous rotation,
and each comprising a central portion movable only on its axis
and side portions capable of a compound movement-that of
rotation on their axes-and of a shifting longitudinal movement,
substantially as described, for the purpose set forth."
"11. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of twisters connected
for simultaneous operation, and each consisting of a central section and the side section, in combination with the spools carried
by the side sections, the central section of each twister being
provided with a longitudinal opening for the passage therethrough of the warp-wire, substantially as described."
" 15. In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series of
rotary twisters geared directly together for simultaneous operation, each twister having a central section capable of rotary
movement only, and two side sections which are capable of a
shifting movement independently of the central section in opposite directions simultaneously, whereby the said shifting sections of one twister are adjusted to register with the central
sections of twisters on opposite sides of the same, substantially
as described, for the purpose set forth."
It is obvious, as said by complainants' expert, "that the terms
sectional twisters ' ' twisters' and ' rotary twisters,' used in the
several claims under consideration, refer to the same three-part
twister devices."

Opinion of the Court.

In Kitselman's original application, the first claim called for
"a series of sectional twisters geared directly together ;" the
second, for "a series of sectional twisters capable of sliding
movement with relation to each other and geared for simultaneous rotation;" the third, for "the series of sectional twisters
comprising the central hub section and the two side sections
disposed on opposite sides of the central section, the hub section
being stationary, while the side sections are capable of shifting
movement;" the fourth, for "the series of sectional twisters,
each of which comprises a longitudinally immovable section and
two sections which have longitudinal movement;" the fifth,
for "the series of sectional twisters, each of which comprises
the central portion carrying the warp-wires and the shifting
side sections which carry the weft-wires."
The first and second claims were rejected, and thereupon
erased, and others substituted, which were likewise rejected,
(the Nesmith patent of 1854 being cited,) were withdrawn, and
the numbers of original claims 3, 4 and 5 were changed to
1, 2 and 3. The latter were then rejected on reference to the
Smith British printed publication of 1876, withdrawn, and
claim 1 as it now stands submitted. That publication, which
was a provisional specification, described a two-part twister,
and added: "Or I divide the twisting wheels into three parts,
my extra wire passing through the central division, and the two
side segments. travel to and fro to form the twist, leaving the
central division in position with my supplementary wire
therein maintained."
The two substituted claims above mentioned as rejected on
reference to Nesmith, and withdrawn, read as follows:
"1. In a wire-fabric machine, a series of rotary twisters
geared directly together for simultaneous rotation and each
having two sections which are capable of a sliding movement,
substantially as described, for the purpose set forth.
"2. In a wire-fabric machine, the combination of a series of
rotary twisters geared directly together, substantially as described, for the purpose set forth."
The Nesmith patent described a machine comprising two
separate but simultaneously operating parts, termed in the

patent the "feeder" and the "twister."
It was a loom machine, so called, and adapted to produce the wire netting
and wrap it about suitable rolls. The feeder was a complete
device for supporting the warp wires, and supporting, rotating
and shifting the woof wires, provided with a take-up roll
mounted on the front end of the "twister."
It comprised a
rectangular frame, together with operating mechanism supported thereon. At the front and rear were five gears in successive engagement, and means were provided for simultaneously rotating both series.
The specification stated that the border wires of the netting
were placed on reels supported on the frame of the machine,
and these passed through holes drilled in the center of the outside gears; and also showed that the gears, other than the
outermost ones, were perforated for the passage of wires in
case it was desired to make a narrower fabric. Each of the
outside gears was formed with two opposite radial slots, extending inward from the margin sufficient to form recesses which
received the ends of spool-carrying frames, each carrying a
woof-wire spool, the front end of each frame being seated in
the marginal slot of one of the gears, and the rear end in the
corresponding slot of the corresponding gear. When all the
gears on their spindles or hubs were so adjusted as to bring the
slots into the same horizontal line any spool-carrier might be
transferred from its supporting gears to the gears next adjacent to those which supported its front and rear ends. When
the spool-carriers of the machine were arranged in pairs on the
alternate gears the rotation of all the gears rotated each pair
of spool-carriers about a common axis, and when the two spoolcarriers on one pair of gears were shifted in opposite directions
to the two pairs of gears on the opposite sides of the pair
previously forming the support of the spool-carriers a remating
of the spool-carriers was effected, and the next rotation of the
gears rotated each newly formed pair of spool-carriers about a
common axis coincident with the axis of the supporting gears.
As a means of transferring the spool-carriers the machine was
provided with "shippers," together with means for sliding
them vertically, one of the "shippers" being adapted to trans-

Opinion of the Court.

fer the spool-carriers in one direction and the other being
adapted to transfer them in an opposite direction or back to
their position. Each of the shippers consisted in a series of
wedges supported in a suitable frame and having inclined faces
adapted to impinge upon the side faces of the end portion of
the spool-carrying frames, the corresponding faces of the
wedges being oppositely inclined in order to impart to them
the reverse movement.
There were in effect five rotating centers, each gear in the
front series with the corresponding gear in the rear series acting as a single rotating part or center. The number of spoolcarriers was one less than the number of centers in use, the
number of rotating centers being five and the number of spoolcarriers being four. In the rotation of the centers the two outermost centers would each support a single spool-carrier, and
the central rotating center would support two spool-carriers.
The rotation of the gears when the spools had the first arrangement would wrap the outer woof wires about the marginal
warp wires and intertwist the other two warp wires at the center of the machine; and the rotation of the gears after the
spool-carriers had been shifted to the second and fourth rotating
centers intertwisted the first and second wires in front of the
second center and the third and fourth wires in front of the
fourth center. The repetition of this operation formed the
fabric.
The Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out that in the Davisson patent the supplemental mechanism of Nesmith was dispensed with and that the diamond mesh was made by a shifting
of the reels instead of the wires.
In respect of the differences between Davisson and ] itselnan
the court stated:
" The spindles of the Davisson machine were arranged vertically ; had, with reference to the Davisson machine, a longitudinal movement; and were alternately forced forward and
withdrawn from the plane of operation by means of a shifting
device that was necessarily bulky and impracticable for field
use. The Kitselman spindles were horizontally placed; had no

189 U. S.

longitudinal or lateral movement; and were confined permanently to the plane of their rotation.
"In the Davisson machine, as in the Kitselman, the spindle,
with its reels, acts as the twisting agent, the spindle forming
the rotator; but in the Davisson machine the spindle, where the
warp wire emerges from its hollow center, stands well back
from the reels, thus allowing the warp wire to go unsupported
to the plane of operation; while in the Kitselman machine the
spindle extends clear forward to the twisting zone, to which
it carries, through its hollow center, the warp wire, fully supported against side pulls. In the Davisson machine the spoolcarriers are transferred to their adjacent spindles by means of
an apparatus previously described as involving a longitudinal
and transverse motion. Kitsehnan effects the transfer of his
spool-carriers by shifting the one to the spindle above the spin(ie with which it has just operated, and the other to the spincde below. This shifting, being brought about by a longitudinal motion only, thus eliminating the necessity of a transverse
motion.
"In the Davisson invention a sinple gear is set behind each
spindle, but none of these gears engage each other, so that,
when the spool-carriers are shifted to adjacent spindles and
cross-heads at each successive twist, they axe revolved about a
practically new center. Kitselman provided each twister at its
central section with a spur gear of sufficient diameter to engage
the gears of the adjacent twisters, and by this means imparted
a simultaneous motion to the whole series of twisters. The
gear arrangement of the Davisson machine tends to twist the
opposing carriers out of alignment; subjects the central wire to
certain deflection; and pulls the woof wires somewhat from
their intended direction. In the Kitsehnan machine the pull,
incident to the twisting operation, is constantly equalized, the
central portions of the twisters offsetting each other in the
plane in which the strain comes.
"These distinctions are, to a certain extent, subsidiary, but
nevertheless important."
In view of what passed in the Patent Office, and the state of
the art, we cannot regard the Kitselman patent as a pioneer

Opinion of the Court.

patent, but think its claims must be limited in their scope to
the actual combination of essential parts as shown, and cannot
be .construed to cover other combinations of elements of different construction and arrangement.
Passing then to the question of infringement, we avail ourselves of the description of the Kitselman patent by defendant's
expert as sufficiently comprehensive to enable us to indicate our
views on that question. Hle says:
"The Kitselman machine has a frame made up of three vertical rigidly connected members forming respectively the front
and rear walls of the frame and an intermediate wall somewhat
nearer to the rear member than to the front. The front and
intermediate members of the frame may each be made of two
parallel bars, or may be each a single bar having a vertical
slotted center; and the rear member may be either open or
solid, as may be desired. . . . A series of rotatable horizontal
hollow spindles are mounted in suitable bearings in the rear and
intermediate members of the frame and are provided with gears
in successive engagement with each other, each gear being rigidly fastened on its spindle, so that the rotation of the gear
must rotate the spindle. One of the gears of the series is provided with a bevel gear rigidly fastened to it and this gear is
in engagement with a bevelled pinion mounted on a crank
shaft, the crank shaft in turn being provided with a suitable
crank and handle for its rotation and for the consequent rotation of all the gears of the series.
"Each of the rotatable spindles is formed with a flat forward
extension in the form of a skeleton frame made up of two transverse members and two longitudinal members,.the whole being
formed in a single piece and being of such length that the transverse members of each flat extension lie respectively, one just
in rear of the front member of the frame and the other just in
front of the intermediate member of the frame. These forward extensions, which are supported by and rotate with the
shafts, have their respective axes coincident with the axes of
the hollow shafts; and the two transverse members of each of
the forward extensions are centrally bored, in line with the
bore of the corresponding shaft, so that warp wires may pass in

189 U. S.

horizontal lines through the rotatable shafts and their forward
extensions. The machine is provided with a series of spoolcarriers, each of which may carry a woof-wire spool; and each
of these spool-carriers is a single-piece casting of the same
length as the forward extension on each of the shafts. Each
such casting consists of a flat longitudinal member adapted to
lie side by side with the flat longitudinal bars of any one of
the forward extensions of the rotatable spindles, and two segmental heads or ends each adapted to lie with its flat side
against the corresponding transverse member of any one of the
forward extensions of the rotating spindle. The segmental
heads of the spool-carrier castings are of such dimensions that
when two of the castings are placed on opposite sides of any
one of the forward extensions of the rotatable spindles, the two
segments and the intermediate transverse member of the spindle extension between them, form a complete circle at either
end of the compound three-part structure made up of the spindle extension and the two spool-carrier castings. Each of the
spool-carrier castings is adapted to receive and support a woof
wire: and it is evident that if two of the castings, with their
spools, be held at any time in fixed connection with one of
the spindle extensions between them, the rotation of the spindle
and its extension must rotate the spool-carrier castings and
their spools. The segments at the ends of each spool-carrier
casting are similar; but only one of them is perforated for the
passage of the woof wire from the spool; and this segment is
in use, made the front end of the spool-carrier. It is clear that
the rotation of any given spindle and its extension, with two
spool-carriers lying on opposite sides of the extension and in
connection therewith, must intertwist the woof wires from the
two spools, at a point in front of the front end of the spindle
extension; and it is further evident that if the machine is to
make the diamond-mesh fabric, means must be provided for
shifting the spool-carriers to and fro between the adjacent
spindle extensions or rotating centers which effect the rotation
of the spool-carriers.
"For the purpose of holding the spool-carrier frames temporarily in registration or engagement with the rotating spindle

extensions, and for the further purpose of shifting the spoolcarriers, in order to remate the woof wires, the machine is provided with two vertically reciprocating guides or shifters, one
on either side of the vertical plane of the axes of the spindles
and their extensions. Each of these guides is made up of two
rigidly connected vertical bars, one just in rear of the front
member of the frame, and the other just in front of the intermediate member of the frame, each of the bars being provided
with a series of castings, extending inward toward the central
plane of the machine and each terminating at its inner end in
a re~ntrant segmental curve adapted to conform to the segmental margin of any one of the heads of the carrier frames
or castings. These castings lie in the planes of the segmental
heads of the carrier frame; and when the two guides or shifters
on opposite sides of the machine are so adjusted that their castings are directly opposite each other, the curved edges of any
two opposite castings are arcs of a common circle and will
practically enclose and hold in working relation, as a complete
circle, the two segmental carrier frame heads lying between
them, together with their interposed transverse member of the
spindle extension. The consequence is, that the carrier frames
may be arranged in pairs on the alternate spindle extensions
of the machine and held in place by the curved edges of the
castings on the guides or shifters, the two curved edges of any
opposite pair of such castings forming a circular guide adapted
to hold the three parts of the corresponding circle of the twister
in proper relation to each other while they are rotated; and
when the parts are thus arranged, the rotation of the spindle
must evidently effect the rotation of the three-part twisters
with their spools and thereby intertwist the wires from the
two spools carried by each spindle extension. Furthermore,
the guides on the two opposite sides of the machine are connected by a walking-beam at the upper end of the frame, so
that as one of them moves upward, the other must move downward to an equal extent; and a lever is provided for effecting
this opposite reciprocation of the two guides or shifters. Before each such movement of the guides or shifters, the twisters
are all rotated into such positions that their flat central mem-

bers (the forward extensions of the spindles) are in the central
vertical plane of the machine, the plane faces of the spool-carrier castings being likewise of course in vertical planes. When
the parts are in this relation, the opposite vertical, movement
of the two guides or shifters must evidently carry the spoolcarriers at one side of the center of the machine downward
and those at the opposite side upward; and the shifters are
given sufficient movement to transfer each spool-carrier from
one spindle to the one next above or below it. It will be understood that in the use of this machine, as in that of any of
the others under consideration, only the alternate spindles are
provided with spools during any given rotation of the parts,
the intermediate spindles being empty. By means of the operation of the guides or shifters just described, the spool-carriers,
in the intervals between the periods of rotation, are transferred
each time from the full spindles to the empty ones, and this
transfer, as in all other machines, remates the wires and effects
the formation of the diamond mesh."
Defendant's machine as described in the Whitney patent of
December 24, 1895, consisted of a vertical upright bar or support; a series of horizontal tubes set rigidly therein; a series of
intermeshing gears mounted and rotating on the tubes, and provided with two projecting studs at the opposite sides of their
centers; a set of plates loosely journalled on the tubes, and
connected to and rotating with the intermeshing gears, and
provided with two projecting spring pins at opposite sides of
their centers, a small distance from the forward projecting studs
on the gears; a set of spool-carriers, each mounted on a plate
having inclined notches at the diagonal corners on one side, and
inclined grooves at the opposite diagonal corners on the other
side, so that when one side of the plate is inserted between a
gear and its plate one of the studs may pass along a groove on
one side, and a spring pin or stud pass into and catch against
the notch on the opposite side, and thus retain and support the
spool-carrier, as long as the parts are rotated in the same direction; spools for the woof wires mounted in the spool-carriers,
and means for imparting rotation to the intermeshing gears.
To transfer the spool-carriers the parts are rotated until the

carriers are between the stationary spindles, when the direction
of rotation is reversed. This causes a pin and stud on the adjacent gear to enter the empty or unoccupied groove in the carrier plate, and to lift it out of connection with the gear plate
with which it had been rotating and to carry it around in its
new relation as long as rotation is continued in that direction.
To shift it again to bring it into relation with another gear and
plate the direction of rotation is again reversed.
Considering the complainants and Whitney as alike having
improved on the prior art, the question is whether the specific
improvements of the one actionably invaded the domain of the
other. The presumption from the grant of the letters patent is
that there was a substantial difference between the inventions.
The Circuit Court found these differences between the two
machines: That in the Kitsehnan machine the spool-carriers
were shifted from one section to another by sliding them in a
straight path ; that all the spool-carriers at one side of the spindles were attached together and moved from one section to
another by means of a common bar; that the spindles were fastened to the pinions and rotated with them; that the spool-carriers were shifted from one section to another by a hand lever
provided for that purpose; that the spool-carriers were required
to be supported at both ends; that the spool-carriers could
readily be taken out, turned end for end, and reinstated in place
again; that the hollow spindle could not be made stationary
without destroying the capacity to operate; that the segmental
ends of the side sections of the twisters made, with the lateral
end pieces of the central sections, wheels at both ends of the
twisters, resting in supports, permitting their rotation; and
that the spool-carriers could not be transferred except when the
parts had been brought to a position of rest and the pinions
were stationary.
That on the other hand, in defendant's machine, the spoolcarriers rotated through a curvilinear path; that the spool-carriers were each separate, from, and moved independently of,
the others; that the spindles were fastened to the frame and
had the pinions loosely mounted on them,'and not rotating with
the spindles; that the spool-carriers were shifted without any

lever by reversing the direction of the rotation of the crank;
that they were only required to be supported at one end, and
could not be taken out, turned end for end, and reinserted; that
the spool-carriers could be made rotative instead of stationary;
that the ends of the central spindles and the spool-carriers formed
no wheels, and were received in no bearings; and that the spoolcarriers could only be transferred when they were rotated. Finally, that the spool carriers in the two machines were so different and mounted and operated in such different ways that
they could not be interchanged or transferred from one to the
other without reorganization.
We perceive no reason to decline acceptance of these findings
of the Circuit Court, and agree with that court in the conclusion that the machines lack that identity of means and identity
of operation which must be combined with identity of result to
constitute infringement.
As we have before stated, the Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the Circuit Court that, unless the patents sued on
embodied a pioneer invention, the defendant's machine was so
differentiated from either of the others that the charge of infringement could not be maintained. The Circuit Court held
all complainants' patents to be only improvements on the prior
art, and dismissed the bill on the ground of non-infringement.
The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Kitselman patent
was entitled to be treated as embodying primary invention and
to such liberal construction as brought defendant's machine
within it. The decree of the Circuit Court was therefore reversed because, in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
certain claims of the Kitselman patent were infringed.
For the reasons given in treating of the Kitselman patent
we think that none of complainants' patents embodied primary
invention, and we concur with both the courts below that, this
being so, the differences in means and operation between defendant's machine and the others were such that there was no
infringement.
It does not seem necessary for us to enumerate these differences in respet of the other three patents. This was well
done in the Circuit Court, and the Circuit Court of Appeals ac-

cepted the view of that court as to the absence of infringement
if primary invention did not exist. We are content with that
conclusion.
Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed; decree of
the Circuit Court afflpned, and mandate to that court accordingly.

HENNESSY v. RICHARDSON DRUG COMPANY.
APPEAL FROMf THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA.
No. 203. Argued March 12, 1903.-Decided 'March 23, 1903.

An averment in a bill that the complainants are "all of Cognac in France,
and citizens of the Republic of France," is sufficient to give the Circuit
Court of the United States for Nebraska jurisdiction in a controversy
where the defendants are citizens of Nebraska. No averment of alienage is necessary.
Where the Circuit Court dismisses a bill on the ground that it has no jurisdiction because diversity of citizenship did not appear, and certifies this
question of jurisdiction, that is the only question for the consideration
of this court on an appeal under the first subdivision of section 5 of the
Judiciary Act of March 3,1891, and if jurisdiction is found to exist the
case will be remanded to be heard on the merits, notwithstanding the
Circuit Court also expressed the opinion that the bill was without
equity.

I. The Constitution and the Judiciary Act provide that the
Federal courts shall have jurisdiction as to controversies where
the necessary jurisdictional amount is involved "between citizens of a State and foreign States, citizens, or subjects thereof."
The complaint alleges that complainants are all citizens of the
Republic of France which clearly and indubitably complies
