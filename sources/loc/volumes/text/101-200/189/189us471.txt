the accident. It is not pressed that there was error on this
point. See Mackin v. Boston & Albany Railroad, 135 Massachusetts, 201 ; G lynn v. Central Railroad,175 Massachusetts,
510, 512. The jury were instructed properly on the subject of
assumption of risks and contributory negligence, and we think
it unnecessary to deal more specifically with this part of the
case.
It was argued that ]Behymer had aggravated the injury by
refusing proper surgical treatment. With regard to this the jury
were instructed in substance, but at more length, that it was
his duty to submit to all treatment that a reasonably prudent
person would have submitted to in order to improve his condition, and that no damages could be allowed which might have
been prevented by reasonable care. It is suggested that, as a
prudent man, he might have postponed recovery from his
injury to recovery of damages. The instructions plainly excluded such a view. The argument hardly is serious. We
have examined all the minute criticisms on the rulings and
refusals to rule, and discover no error. We deem it unnecessary
to answer them in greater detail.

UNITED STATES v. SWEET.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 236. Argued and submitted April 15, 1903.-Decided April 27,1903.

An officer of volunteers in the United States Army who tenders his resignation and is honorably discharged is not entitled to travel pay and
commutation of subsistence, under Rev. Stat. § 1289, as amended by
the act of February 27, 1877, c. 69, 19 Stat. 243, fr6m the place of his
discharge to where he was mustered in.
This decision is in accord with the settled practice of the War Department
and the Treasury which has been to deny these allowances when the officer or soldier is discharged at his own request, for his own pleasure or
convenience. The weight of a contemporaneous and long continued
construction of a statute by those charged with its execution is well recognized in cases openjto reasonable doubt.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case comes here by appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Claims in favor of the petitioner, Sweet. The petitioner was a second lieutenant of volunteers in the United
States Army, tendered his resignation, and was honorably
discharged on October 15, 1898. He was mustered into the
service at St. Paul, Minnesota, his residence being Minneapolis. The place of his discharge was Camp Meade, Pennsylvania. He was not furnished transportation or subsistence,
but returned to his residence at his own expense, and later
brought this petition to recover travel pay and commutation
of subsistence under Rev. Stat. § 1289, as amended by the act
of February 27, 1877, c. 69, 19 Stat. 24,3, 244. That section
allows the items demanded "when an officer is discharged
from the service, except by way of punishment for an offence."
The question whether the statute extends to cases like the
present has been before this court twice, but has not been decided authoritatively. In one case the court was equally
divided, United States v. P'ice,No. 60, December Term, 1870;
S. C., 4 C. Cl. 164. In the other the decision went off upon
another point. UJnited States v. T]hornton, 160 U. S. 654;
.0., 27 C. 0. 342.
It is admitted that the settled practice of the War Department and of the Treasury has been to deny the allowances
claimed when an officer or soldier is discharged at his own
request, for his own pleasure or convenience. TFhitmeyer, 3

Opinion of the Court.

Book, vol. 18, p. 184; Weevil, Second Comptroller's Letter
Book, vol. 26, p. 296.

The weight of a contemporaneous and

long continued construction of a statute by those charged with
its execution is well recognized in cases open to reasonable
doubt. United States v. Johnston, 124 U. S. 236, 253 ; United
States v. Finnell, 185 U. S. 236, 244. But it is said that in
this case the language of the statute admits of no doubt. It is
argued that the words "except by way of punishment for an
offence" exclude the implication of other exceptions to the
rule. Some force was attributed also to the amendment to the
Revised Statutes, which substituted for "honorably discharged
from the service" the present words "discharged from the
service, except by way of punishment for an offence." The
change, however, is merely a recurrence to the language of the
earlier statutes under which the practice of the War Department grew up, so that no particular weight can be given to
that.
The words "discharged from the service, except by way of
punishment for an offence," are found in the acts of March 3,
1799, c. 48, § 25, 1 Stat. 755; March 16, 1802, c. 9, § 24, 2 Stat.
137'; January 11, 1812, c. 14, § 22, 2 Stat. 674; and January 29,
1813, c. 16, § 15, 2 Stat. 796. See further the acts of April 12,
1808, c. 43, § 5, 2 Stat. 483 ; March 3, 1815, c. 79, § 4, 3 Stat.
225; July 22, 1861, c. 9, § 5, 12 Stat. 269 ; July 29, 1861, c. 24,
§4, 12 Stat. 280; June 20, 1864, c. 145, §8, 13 Stat. 145;
March 16, 1896, c. 59, 29 Stat. 63 ; June 7, 1900, c. 860, 31 Stat.
708; February. 8, 1901, c. 342, 31 Stat. 762. The phrase,
"honorably discharged," seems first to have appeared in the
Revised Statutes, and to have been amended back to the ancient
form in three years. Except for that short intervening time,
the allowance of travel pay and commutation of subsistence has
gone on under the early words and the practical construction
of them to which we have referred.
It follows that the only question is whether the meaning of
the long used phrase is too clear for almost equally long established practice to control. It seems to us not to be so. It is
quite true that in the military service the word " discharge" is
the word applied to an order ending the service of an officer at

his own request. But in other connections it conveys the notion
of a movement beginning with the superior and more or less
adverse to the object, as, for instance, when we speak of discharging a servant. Usually it is a slightly discrediting verb.
If it is taken in its ordinary meaning here, the exception in
case of a discharge by way of punishment raises no difficulty,
because a discharge on resignation is not within the meaning
of the principal clause. The course of the departments has
amounted to no more than interpreting the word in this exact
sense.
Enlisted men are given similar allowances by § 1290 and the
earlier statutes cited. By the act of June 7, 1900, c. 860, 31
Stat. 708, when the Secretary of War, in the exercise of his
discretion, has directed the discharge "of any enlisted men
and the orders . . . stated that such enlisted men
were entitled to travel pay," such order is to be sufficient authority for payment of the allowances under § 1290. This recognizes that it is usual to state in the order whether the soldier is
entitled to travel pay or not, and seems to accept existing
practices as they are. It has no effect upon the cases before
us further than as another slight indication of the understanding in the service. But taking everything into account we are
not prepared to overturn the long established understanding of
the departments charged with the execution of the law.
Judgment reversed.

No. 235. Argued with No. 236, ante, p. 471, and by the same
counsel.
MR.JUSTIcE HoLEmS: This is the case of an enlisted man who
makes a claim similar to the abov e, under Rev. Stat. § 1290, as
amended. He was discharged on his own application, and the
order of discharge stated that he was not entitled to travel
pay. The foregoing reasoning also governs this case.
Judgment reversed.
