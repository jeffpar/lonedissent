WIGHT v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 494. Argued November 5, 6, 1896. -Decided

May 24, 1897.

Hauling goods on the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad from Cincinnati to Pittsbuirgh aad delivering them to a consignee in his warehouse
from a siding connection, and hauling similar goods for him from and
to the same cities on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and delivering them
to him from the station of that road in Pittsburgh, there being no siding
connection, is transportation " under substantially similar circumstances
and conditions," within the meaning of section 2 of the interstate commerce act of February 4, 1887, c. 104; and a rebate allowed him by the
Baltimore and Ohio road to compensate for cartage to his warehouse is
a discrimination against other shippers over that road to whom no rebate is allowed.
Whether the same words as used in section 4 of that act have a broader
meaning or a wider reach than they do as used in section.2, is not determined.
