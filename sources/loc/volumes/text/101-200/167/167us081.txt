by writ of certiorari. The reasonable inference from this is,
that the possession of the premises, with the right to use
these improvements, throughout the lease and the extension
thereof, would be worth more than $5000, showing that the
matter in dispute is of sufficient pecuniary value to support
the jurisdiction of this court."
No such inference can be drawn from anything in this
record, and the result is that the writ of error must be
Dismissed.

LATTA v. GRANGER.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 308.

Argued April 29, 1897. - Decided May 10, 1897.

By its decision in Goode v. Gaines, 145 U. S. 141, the court did not intend
to be understood as holding that the rental value after the date of the
rendition of the decree had not been satisfactorily determined, and had in
mind in that regard only the exclusion from the decree of November 10,
1887, of the amount found due plaintiffs for rent prior to that date,
together with interest thereon; nor that the finding by that decree of
the then value of the improvements should be disturbed.
The reversal of that decree amounted to nothing more than a vacating of
the accounting so as to permit of a modification thereof in particulars
pointed out with sufficient precision in the opinion; and it,
might well
be held that the Circuit Court had no power, under the mandate, to
again go into the questions of rental rate and value of improvements,
which had been determined, and that an accounting was only required
to bring the amounts, including subsequent taxes, if any, paid by defendant, and interest down to date.
Apart from that, the rent prescribed by the lease did not appear from the
extrinsic evidence to be unreasonable or excessive; nor does the additional evidence, when carefully analyzed, all the evidence being taken
together, compel to any other conclusion.
It is clear that, under the circumstances, this is not a case for the application of the principle of the acceptance by an appellate court of the
conclusions of a master, concurred in by the trial court, when depending on conflicting testimony; and this court cannot permit its views
to be overcome by presumptions in favor of the second report and
decree.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the

W. H. Gaines leased a tract of ground now included in lot
sixteen, block sixty-eight, Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1875, for
one year, with the right of renewal from year to year, until
the title. to the Hot Springs quarter section was settled, to
Perry Huff at a rental of $160 a year, payable in monthly
instalments. The lot was described in the lease as sixteen
feet in width and the rate was, therefore, $10 per front foot.
In 1876 the United States took possession of the lot, and, it
is alleged, subsequently leased' it to Huff through a receiver
appointed by the Court of Claims, though no such lease is in
the record. Afterwards Huff sold all his right, title and
interest in the lot to Vina Granger and Eva M. James, who
took with knowledge of the derivation of Huff's interest.
'The general history of the litigation, of which this case is
a branch, will be found in the Hot Springs cases, 92 U. S. 698,
and Rector v. Gibbon, 111 U. S. 276.
This was a bill filed May 23, 1884, in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas by
W. H. Gaines and wife against Perry Huff, Eva M. James
and Vina Granger for a decree that the legal title of the lot
was held by defendants in trust for plaintiffs, for possession,
and for an accounting. The case in its progress was discontinued as against Huff and James, and executors were substituted as plaintiffs. A decree was rendered on March 2, 1887,
transferring title from defendant Granger to plaintiffs, and
directing defendant to make a deed accordingly; and the
case was referred to a special master to ascertain and report
the value of the rents of the lot since the award made by

LATTA v. GRANGER.
Opinion of the Court.

the commissioners appointed under the act of Congress of
March 3, 1877, 19 Stat. 377, c. 108; the amount of taxes paid
by defendant on the lot since that award; and the value of
the improvements made upon the lot before the award, and
afterwards. This decree placed the then value of the lot at
$5500. The master filed his report April 9, 1887, in which he
found the rental value of the lot without improvements to be
ten dollars per front foot per annum, and that the frontage
was 21.2 feet; that the present value of the improvements
was $1800; and the amount of taxes which had been paid.
On November 10, 1887, a final decree was rendered, overruling exceptions to the. master's report, and stating an
account between the plaintiffs and defendant as follows:
The amount due to plaintiffs for rent "according to the
terms of the lease, from the date of award to the date of
filing of the bill in this case and interest"; the amount due
plaintiffs "since said date and until the filing of the master's
report, the rental value of the property, and interest annually,"
and the "amount of rent to date of this decree" ; and, on the
other hand, the amount due defendant for taxes paid and interest; the amount of purchase money paid by her to the Government for the lot and interest; and the. present value of the
improvements fixed at $1800. The account, as stated, left a
balance due defendant of $555.12, for which recovery was
decreed ; and it was further decreed that plaintiffs be put
in possession. From this decree an appeal was prayed to
Goode v. Gaines, 145
this court and the decree reversed.
U. S. 141.
We reversed, that decree because, in view of the circumstances detailed in the opinion, we thought that the accounting should not be carried back of the filing of the bill, May 23,
1884, except as to 'one item. And it was said: "We are of
opinion that the accounting between the parties should be
stated both as to debit and credit from the 23d of May, 1884,
with the exception of the credit for the amounts paid to the
Government for the lots, of which payments we regard appellees as getting the entire benefit, and that no increased
rent should be allowed on account of the improvements, as

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

appellees are only to be held to their value as of the date of
the decrees. In other words, appellants should be charged
with rental value from the date of the filing of the bills to
the rendition of the decrees, with interest, and should be
credited with taxes, etc., paid after the date of the filing of
the bills, with interest, and also with the amounts paid the
Government for the different parcels, with interest from the
dates of payment, as well as with the value of the improvements, in each instance, at the time of the rendition of the
decrees."
That decision was rendered in several cases considered and
disposed of at the same time.
Our imandate having gone down to the 'Circuit Court "for
further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the
opinion of this court," that court held that the defendant was
entitled to enter upon her defence as if the whole matter was
again at large. Thereupon plaintiffs made an application to
this court for a writ of mandamus commanding, the judge of
the Circuit Court to carry out the decree heretofore made
in the cause by this court. The mandamus was granted and
the case is reported, Gaines v. Rugg, 148 U. S. 228, 240. Mr.
Justice Blatchford, delivering the opinion of the court, said:
"It is, we think, very plain that so much of the decree of the
Circuit Court of November 11, 1887, as was not disapproved
by this court still stands in full force. Whatever there is to
impair that decree must be sought for only in the opinion,
decree and mandate of this court. This court held that no
objection could be sustained to the provisions of the decree
of the Circuit Court as to the title. It found error only in
the rules prescribed by the Circuit Court for the taking of the
account, and the decree of that court was reversed only for
the purpose of taking an account according to the principles
laid down by this court. As the decree of the Circuit Court
in regard to the title was not invalidated by the action of this
court on the appeal, the Circuit Court had no right to set
aside that decree as respected the title nearly five years after
it was rendered. The decree was beyond the control of the
Circuit Court, unless on a bill of review duly filed, and the

LATTA v. GRANGER.
Opinion of the Court.

time for filing a bill of review had long ago elapsed. The Circuit Court could do nothing to affect the decreer except in
obedience to the mandate of this court."
After the mandamus was granted the Circuit Court entered
the decree as ordered; and appointed another special master,
directing him "to proceed to state an account between said
parties according to the terms of this decree, and to that end
he shall take testimony in writing of all witnesses produced,
and shall report the same with all his proceedings and findings
herein to this court."
The statement of the account was in itself as the case stood
a mere matter of computation, and the record does not show
that there had been any surrender of possession or any other
act after the decree of November 10, 1887, which would affect
the final result. The master, however, instead of restating
the account, corrected in the particulars indicated by us, proceeded to take new proofs as to rental value and the value of
the improvements; and thereupon found the value of the improvements to be $2625, and cut down the rents to six dollars
per front foot. The report was excepted to, the exceptions
.overruled, and a decree rendered January 23, 1894, that plaintiffs pay defendants the sum of $2316.23. From this decree
plaintiffs prosecuted an appeal tu the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit, the decree was affirmed, and the case
was then brought to this court. 32 U. S. App. 342.
In these proceedings in the Circuit Court there was error
and its decree must be reversed. It is true that in Goode v.
Gaines we said that defendants "should be charged with rental
value from the date of the filing of the bills to the rendition
of the decrees with interest," but we did not intend to be
understood as holding that the rental value after that date
had not been satisfactorily determined, and had in mind in
that regard only the exclusion from the decree of November
10, 1887, of the amount found due plaintiffs for rent prior to
that date, together with interest thereon. Nor did we intend
that the finding by that decree of the then value of the
improvements should be disturbed.
The reversal of that decree amounted to nothing more than.

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

a vacating of the accounting so as to permit of a modification
thereof in particulars pointed out with sufficient precision in
the opinion, and it might well be held that the Circuit Court
had no power, under our mandate, to again go into the questions of rental rate and value of improvements, for they had
been determined, and an accounting was only required to
bring the amounts, including subsequent taxes, if any, paid by
defendant, and interest down to date.
But, apart from that, the rent prescribed by the lease was
at the rate of ten dollars per front foot, and this did not appear from the extrinsic evidence to be unreasonable or excessive. Nor does the additional evidence, when carefully
analyzed, all the evidence being taken together, compel to
any other conclusion.
So that, without being absolutely controlled by the terms
of the lease, and without attributing conclusive effect to the
first report and the decree thereon, we remain of opinion that
the rental value per annum of ten dollars per front foot, and
the sum of eighteen hundred dollars as the value of the improvements, should be decreed. As to this last item, the
lapse of time would not increase the value, and there is no
evidence in the record of additional improvements since the
filing of the bill, if subsequent improvements could in any
aspect be allowed for.
And it should be observed that it is clear that, under the
circumstances, this is not a case for the application of the
principle of the acceptance by an appellate court of the conclusions of a master, concurred in by the trial court, when
depending on conflicting testimony. We cannot permit our
views to be overcome by presumptions in favor of this second
report and decree.
The decree will be reversed at appellees' costs and the cause
remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to enter a decree to the effect that all the right, title, claim and interest of
defendant in and to lot sixteen, block sixty-eight, in the city
of. Hot Springs, Arkansas; be and the same is divested out of
her and vested in said plaintiffs, and 'that defendant convey
said lot to plaintiffs, .orthat a master do it for her; that plain-

tiffs have and recover of defendant the possession of said lot
sixteen in block sixty-eight; and that a writ of possession
issue, or that a copy of said decree be served upon her, which
shall operate as such writ; that an account between plaintiffs
and defendant be stated, and in doing so that defendant be
charged with the tental value of the lot at ten dollars per
front foot per annum from May 23, 1884, down to date of
decree, with interest on the same from the end of each year
at the rate of six per cent per annum; that plaintiffs be
charged with all taxes paid by defendant on thb lot since
May 23, 1884, with interest on the same from time of payment until date of decree, at the rate of six per cent per
annum; also with $1800, adjudged to be the value of improvements placed ky defendant on said lot; also with the
sum paid by defendant to the United States for the lot and
interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from
the date of payment to date of decree; and that judgment be
entered for the balance; and that plaintiffs recover their costs
in the court below.
Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed; decree
of Circuit Court reversed, and cause remanded to that
court with directions to enter a decree in conformity
