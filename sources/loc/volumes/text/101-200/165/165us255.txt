OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Dissenting Opinion. White, Field, Harlan, Brown, JJ.

These were three aotions instituted by the State of Indiana,
in the Circuit Court of Marion County in that State, against
the American Express Company, the Adams Express Company and the United States Express Company, to recover
unpaid taxes for the years 1893 and 1894-.
The defendants filed answers, setting up, among other defences, that the act under which the taxes were assessed was
invalid because in contravention of the Constitution of the
United States.
The causes were consolidated and tried by the Circuit Court,
which made a special finding of facts and stated conclusions
of law thereon in favor of the defendants, and entered judgment accordingly The consolidated cause having been carried on appeal to the Supreme Court of the State the
judgment below was reversed, and the cause remanded, with
instructions to restate the conclusions of law and to enter
judgment against the defendant in each case as specifically
directed. 42 N. E. Rep. 483. This was done, and from the judgments so entered writs of error were sued out from this court.
The legislation of the State of Indiana, the validity of
which is attacked in these cases, so far corresponds with that
of the State of Ohio, that the questions presented upon this
record are\the same, in effect, as those considered in Adams
Express Co. v Oho State Auditor, and other cases, just
decided, 165 U. S. 194, and require no reexamination.
For the reasons there given the judgments are
-Affirmed.

JUSTICE

HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE

BRowN and myself dissent from the judgments of the court
in these cases. As there is no substantial difference between
the legal questions presented in the Ohio cases and those in
the present cases, the reasons stated in the dissent announced
in the former are relevant here, and are referred to as furnishing the reasons for this dissent.
