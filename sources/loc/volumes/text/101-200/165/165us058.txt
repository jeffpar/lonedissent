GARDNER v. DONALD.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
Nob. 411, 412, 413.

Argued October 21, 22, 196. -

Decided January 18, 1897.

Where'a suit is brought against defendants who claim to act as officers of
a State and under color of an unonstitutional statute commit acts of
wrong and injury to the property of the plaintif, to recover money or
property in their hands unlawfully taken by them in behalf of the State,
or for compensation for damages, such suit is not an action against the
State within the meaning of the E leventh Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.
Although the question of the jurisdiction of the court below has not been
certified to this court in the manner provided by the fifth section of the
judiciary act of March 3, 1891, yet, as the case is before it in a case in
which the law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the Consti-tution of the United States under another clause of that statute it has
jurisdiction of the entire case and of all questions involved in it.
Damages are the compensation winch the law awards for an injury done;
and exemplary damages are allowable, in excess of the actual loss, where
a tort is aggravated by evil motive, actual malice, deliberate violence
or oppression.
The intentional, malicious and repeated interference by the defendants with
the exercise of personal rights and privileges secured to the plaintiffs by
the Constitution of the United States, as alleged in the complaint, constitutes a wrong and injury not the subject of compensation by a mere
money standard, but fairly within the doctrine of the cases wherein exemplary damages have been allowed, as those allegations of the complaints, though denied m the answers, have been sustained.
The statute of South Carolina of January 2, 1895, entitled "an act to further
declare the law in reference to, and further regulate the use, sale, consumption, transportation and disposition of alcoholic liquids or liquors
within the State of South Carolina, and to police the same," recognizes
liquors and wines as commodities which may be lawfully made, bought
and sold, and which must therefore be deemed to be the subject of foreign
and interstate commerce, and is an obstruction to and interference with
that commerce, and must, as to those of its provisions which affect the
plaintiffs, stand condemned.
'That statute is not an inspection law, and is not within the scape of the act
, August 8, 1890, c. 728.

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Statement of the Case.
Whether those provisions of the act which direct that so-called contraband
liquors may be seized without warrant by any state constable, sheriff or
policeman, while in transit or after arrival, whether in possession of a
common carrier, depot agent, express agent or private person, and which
subject common carriers to fine and imprisonment for carrying liquors
in any package, cask, jug, box or other package, under any other than
the proper name or brand known to the trade, and which forbid the bringing of any suit for damages alleged to arise by seizing and detention of
liquors would be lawful In an inspection law otherwise valid, is not
decided.
So far as these actions are concerned, the damages recovered were for acts
committed under the alleged authority of the act of 1895, and cannot be
affected by the provisions of the subsequent act of 1896, even if the invalidities of the former act were thereby remedied - a matter on which no
opinion is expressed.

IN the Circuit Court of the United States for the District
of South Carolina, in February, 1895, two suits at law were
brought by James Donald against J M. Scott,.and one by
Donald against Gardner etc., wherein plaintiff sought to recover damages caused by the action of the defendants, who
were state constables of the State of South Carolina, in seizing and carrying away several packages of wines and liquors
belonging to the plaintiffs, and, at the time of the seizure, in
the possession of railroad companies which-as common carriers
had brought the packages within the State.
It appeared that one of the packages, consisting of a case
of domestic California Wine, came by rail from Savannah,
Georgia, whither it had been imported by the plaintiff
another, consisting of a ca e of whiskey, in bottles, made in
Maryland, and imported by the plaintiff by way of the Baltimore Steam Packet line, and another, consisting of one
barrel of bottled beer, made at Rochester, New York, and
imported by the plaintiff into the State of South Carolina by
way of the Old Dominion Steamship line.
Demurrers to the several declarations or complaints were
interposed and overruled. Thereupon issues of fact were
joined, and, trial by jury having been duly waived, the causes
were tried and determined by the court, and resulted in findings and judgments in favor of the said plaintiff for the
s,17 L of three hundred dollars and costs in each case, respec-

tively Writs of error from this court were.then sued out and
allowed.
M11r THilliam A. Barber,Attorney General of the State of
Sbuth Carolina, for plaintiffs in error.
I. The plaintiffs in error, as state constables, were authorized by the act generally known as the dispensary law to
seize the liquors seized. See sections 43, 32, 29, 83, 1 and 25.
II. The dispensary act of South Carolina is the lawful
exercise of the police power of the State and is not in conflict
with Article 9 of the Constitution of the United States in so
far as it prohibits citizens of the State from importing within
the State alcoholic liquors for their own use and consumption.
The sole question is whether so much of -the dispensary law
of South Carolina as prohibits the importation of alcoholic
liquors from other States for personal use was enacted in the
legitimate exercise of the police power of the State, and, if
so, it is above the Constitution and acts of Congress, and no
Federal question is presented.
This leads to -the inquiry, What is the police power of a
State 2
This honorable court has said that the police power cannot
be accurately defined, and, without attempting a definition,
I would say it is that great attribute of sovereignty by which
a State is justified in its self-protection and self-preservation,
and if implies the use of the necessary means for the protection of the correlative and reciprocal rights of the sovereign
and the citizen. The present measure of the power of a sovereign State is the full measure of its rights before it joined
the federation, except in so far as the provisions of the Federal Constitution or its own people have modified it, We
know that the State gave up to the Union the right to regulate commerce, tax imports, declare war, proclaim peace, emit
bills of credit, coin.money and operate the post office. But it
gave up no. right based upon those fundamental principles not
laid down m the Federal Constitution, and which are necessary to the protection, of itself, necessary to the safety, com-

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

fort and well-being of society, and necessary to the protection
of its citizens against the evils of intemperance, pauperism and
crime. The polide power is among the reserved powers of the
State.
For the views of this court see N-ew York v. -Miln, 11 Pet.
102, Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U..S. 27, Stone v. _isszssP1 ,
108 U. S. 814, In re.l'ah'er,140 U. S.545, Crowley v Ch~rstensen, 137 U. S. 86, Slaughter House cases, 16 Wall. 36,
Bartemeyer v. iowa, 18.Wall. 129, Foster v Kansas,112 U. S.
201. In view of the principles laid down in these cases,
there can be no doubt that the dispensary act is a police measure. In Bartemeyer v. Iowa it was held that a state law prohibiting the manufacture and- sale of intoxicating liquors was
not repugnant to the, Constitution. In Foster v Zansas, this
doctrine was repeated.
In 1887, in the case of -owman v Chicago & Northwestern
Railway, 125 U. S.465, it was held that a law of Iowa forbidding the bringing into the State from other States of intoxicating liquors without a certificate, as therein required,
was a regulation of commerce -among the States, and was
void as being repugnant to the Constitution, such statute not
being an inspection law, or a quarantine law, or a sanitary
measure, and therefore not a legitimate exercise of the police
power of the State.
Then came the decision of Lemsy v. Hardin,135 U. S.100,
in which it was held that a party had the right under the
Interstate Commerce Acts to import intoxicating liquor into
the State, and the importer had the right to sell the imported
liquor in the State so long as it remained in the original
package.
This case induced the passage of the act of 1890.
In n re Rahrer, the constitutionality of that act was
assailed, but it was sustained by the court.
That act is the controlling act now, and by it Congress has
provided that upon the arrival of liquors within the State,
they become .subject to the police power of the State, to the
same extent and in the same manner as though such liquors
had been produced by the State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
N

While this act did not add to the police power of the State,
it did give expression to the will of Congress that a State
'could control intoxicating liquors as articles of commerce
upon their arrival in the State, no. matter where manufactured
or from where imported, and Congress thus relinquished any
power as to this article, which had been conferred by the
Constitution of. the United States, upon its arrival in such
State.
But it is contended in this case that the dispensary law is
in contravention of the Interstate Commerce Acts, because
it discriminates against products of other States and against
citizens of other States
1. In that it allows dispensaries to sell intoxicating liquor,
while citizens from other States are not allowed to send it
into the State for sale
2. In that ijt discrminates against intoxicating liquors, the
product of other States, by prohibiting their introduction into
the State for sale or use.
The act does authorize the sale of ales, wines and liquors
by the State, and does prohibit all citizens of this State, as
well as citizens of other States, from bringing them into the
State for sale or use.
The act does allQw the commissioner for the State to buy
liquors outside the State, and does prohibit other persons from
buying and bringing them into the State.
But we maintain that this is a legitimate exercise of the
police power, and does not in any way regulate commerce
between the States, and is not a discrimination against prodacts or citizens of other States. It places citizens and products
of this State on an equal- footing with those of other States.
Domestic liquors and foreign liquors are alike subject to the
provisions of the law While citizens of other States are forbidden to sell liquors within this State, the prohibition extends
to citizens of this State as well, and while a citizen is prohibited from importing liquor, he is likewise prohibited from
purchasing within the State any liquors not previously analyzed by the chemist and sold by the proper officers of the
State.

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

The act may remotely affect commerce, but it does not
interfere with or regulate it by discrimination or otherwise.

In the light of these cases, we submit that the dispensary
law is a legitimate exercise of the policq power.
We further spbmit
1. The law does not discriminate against liquors the products of other States, but makes the liquors produced in this
State, as well as those imported, subject to it.
Under the act of 1890, liquors imported from other States
upon 'their arrival become subject to the pQlice power, and if
liquors manufactured in the State are put upon the. same footing there is no discrimination against them on account of
their extra-state origin.
2. The law does not discriminate against the citizens of
other States. Citizens of this State are-put on an equality
with them. None of them can sell intoxicating liquors. It
is true the State sells, but none of her citizens can do so.
-3. The law does require. her citizens to buy from dispensaiies, but no citizen from other States is inhibited from
doing so.
There is no discrimination in the law against citizens or
products of other States, as such, and because they are citizens and products of other States, but the object is to protect
the public morals, public health and public safety It is not
the intention of the law to regulate interstate commerce, but
to protect the people of the State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Argument for Plaintiffs inError.

But it may be said that while the State. sells liquors.to her
own citizens she cannot prohibit the ntroduction. of liquors
from other States upon thie ground that they are deleterious
and for the purpose of protecting her citizens from fraud and
deception.
The provision in the act requiribg all liquors sold by the
dispensaries to undergo an analysis and tlhelr purity to be
certified sufficiently answers this objection.
Then we maintain *that the complainant is denied no right,
privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws
of the United States, and no Federal question arises in this
action. The simple averment in-the bill that a Federal question is presented is not sufficient. New Orleans v New
Orleans Mater Works, 142 U. S. 79, Hamblin v Western .and
Co., 14=7 U. S. 531.
The intention of the general assembly, as is evident from
Ghe general scope and detailed provisions of the dispensary
act, was to protect the public health, public morals and
public peace of the State, and not to burden or regulate interstate commerce. Some of the late cases indicate a modification by this court of views expressed in earlier cases Ss to
the extent to which state legislatures may enact police regulations. Changed conditions, industrial development and more
enlightened thought in this country have necessitated progressive exercise of the police power in the solution of social
and governmental problems. The dispensary act is an example of legislation in this direction. It is difficult to conceive
of any law enacted in exercise of the police power that does
not affect interstate commerce, and in every instance the question is, does it affect commerce to the extent of its regulation?
We repeat, the dispensary act is not directed against commerce or any of its regulations, but relates to the rights,
duties and liabilities of citizens, and only incidentally and
remotely affects the operations of commerce. Such laws have
uniformly been held valid, and upon this principle we seek to
uphold the act.
III. The executive officers of the State of South Carolina
are equally as anxious as the complainant herein to have the

legal issues raised in this cause finally adjudicated by this
honorable court. With a view to securing a final decision,
and feeling that it is just to the court as well as to parties
litigant that the present method ol operating the South Carolina dispensary should be fully understood; a suggestion has
been submitted calling the attention of the court to the recent
enactment of the general assembly of South Carolina relative
to the dispensary The dispensary system, as a solution of
the liquor question, is yet in its infancy, and the state legislature in passing the act of 1896 endeavored to perfect the
business details of the institution. At the same time the inspection feature of the law was materially changed. It is to
this alteration particularly that we invite attention, and respectfully ask that the court, if it deem proper, consider its
provisions in this respect as affecting the act approved January 2, 1895, and the order of injunction in this case. Without discussing in detail those features of the act, we submit
that, as an inspection law, it is subject to the following
principles
1. That the-States, in the exercise of the police power, may
pass inspection laws which are not in their express words or
operation a burden upon interstate commerce, by discriminat
ing against the products or citizens of other States, and which
operate equally upon products and citizens of the States themselves and citizens and products of other States. Robbm v.

exercise of the police power it enacts a law declaring the use
of any article to be ugainst them, it will not conflict with the

it discriminates against the citizens and products of other

JUSTICE

SHmAs delivered the opinion of the court.

The records in these cases present the question of the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of the act of

and committed such trespasses wilfully and maliciously, with
the purpose and intent to trample on the plaintiff's rights
under the law and to do him all the injury in the pow.r of
the defendants.
These allegations must, for the purpose of disposing of the
present q1estion, be accepted by us as true or, at least, as
susceptible of proof.
Damages have been defined to be the compensation which
th law will award for an injury done, and are said to be
.exemplary and allowable in excess of the actual loss, where
a tort is, aggravated by evil motive, actual malice, deliberate
violence or oppression. While some courts and text-writers

have questioned the soundness of this doctrine, it has been
accepted m England, in most of the States of this Union, and
has received the sanction of this court.
In the case of Wilkes v Wood, Lofft, 19, which was an

action of trespass for breaking into the plaintiff's house and
seizing his papers, under color of a general -warrant by a secretary of State, Chief Justice Pratt, in charging the jury, and
in replying to the contention of the solicitor general that
damages nominal or merely compensatory were all that could
be allowed, said "Notwithstanding what the solicitor gencompetent fo such prosecuting offieer to move for, and for the presiding

eral has. said, I have formerly delivered it as my opinion on
another occasion, and I still continue of the same mind, that a
jury have it in their power to give damages for more than the
injury received. Damages are designed not only as a **atisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a punishment to the
guilty, to deter from any such proceeding foi the future, and as
a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself." The
jury found.a verdict with a thousand pounds damages.
In the case of Hlucde v Money, 2 Wilson, 205, there was a
motion for a new trial on the ground that the jury had allowed
excessive damages. It was proved on the trial .that the plaintiff was a journeyman printer, and was taken in custody by
the defendant, under the general warrant of a secretary of
State, upon suspicion of'.having printed a certain libellous
paper; that the defendant kept him in custody about six
hours, but used him very civilly by treating him with beefsteaks and beer, so that he suffered very little or no damages.
The jury gave him a verdict in three hundred pounds damages.
In disposing of the motion, the Lord Chief Justice Pratt said
"That if the jury had been confined by their oath to consider
the mere personal injury only, perhaps twenty pounds damages
would have been thought sufficient, but the small injury done
to the plaintiff, or the inconsiderableness of his station and
rank in life, did not appear to the jury in that striking light,
in which the great point of law touching the liberty of the
I cannot say
subject appeared to them at the trial.
what damages I should have given if I had been upon the jury,
but I directed and told them they were not bound to any certain damages. Upon the whole I am of opinion the damages
are not excessive, and that it is very dangerous for the .judges
to intermeddle in damages for torts, it must be a glaring case
indeed of outrageous damages in a tort, and which all mankind
at first blush must think so, to induce a court to grant a new
trial for excessive damages."
In Day v Woodworth, 13 How 371, which was an action
of trespass charging the defendants with tearing down and
destroying the plaintiff's mill dam, this court, through Mr.
Justice Grier, said

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

"It is a well-established principle of the common law that,
in actions of trespass and all actions on the case for torts, a
jury may inflict what are called exemplary, punitive or vindictive damages upon a defendant, having in view the enormity of his offence rather than the measure of compeifsation
to the plaintiff. We are aware that the propriety of this doctrine has been questioned by some writers, but if repeated
judicial decisions for more than a century are to be received
as the best exposition of what the law is, the question will
not admit of argument. By the common, as well as by
statute law, men are often pumshed for aggravated misconduct or lawless acts, by means of a civil action, and the damages. inflicted by way of penalty or punishment given to the
party injured. In many civil actions, -such as libel, slander,
seduction, etc., the wrong done to the plaintiff is incapable
of being measured by a money standard, and the damages
assessed depend on the circumstances, showing the degree of
moral turpitude or atrocity of the defendant's conduct, and
may properly be termed exemplary or vindictive rather than
compensatory
"In actions of trespass, where the injury has been wanton
and malicious, or gross and outrageous, courts permit juries
to add to the measured compensation of the plaintiff which
he would have been entitled to'recover, had -the injury been
inflicted without design or intention, something farther by
way of punishment or example, which has sometimes been
called ' smart money' This has always been left to the discretion of the jury, as the degree of punishment to be thus
inflicted must depend on the particular 'circumstances of each
case."
Pliladelpkma, MVilmsngton & :BaltimoreRailroadv Quzgley,
21 How. -202, 213, was a case wherein a railroad company was
responsible in anaction for the publication of a libel, and
although this court reversed the Circuit Court for allowing
the jury to give exemplary damages, because there was no
evidence that the injury was inflicted maliciously or wantonly,
yet the case of Day v. Woodwortk, 13 How 363, was cited
with approval as recognizing the power of a jury in certain

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Opinion of the Court.

actions of tort to assess against the tort-feasor punitive or
exemplary damages, and as laying down the law that whenever the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously
or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely ov indignity,. the jury are not limited to the ascertainment of a simple
compensation for the wrong committed against the aggrieved
person.
This was likewise recognized a's well-settled doctrine in the
case of Lake Swre Railway v. Prentice,147 U. S. 107.
The intentional, malicious and repeated interference by the
defendants with the exercise of personal rights and privileges
secured to .the plaintiff by the Constitution of the 'United
States, as alleged in the complaint, constitutes, as we think,
a wrong and injury not the subject of compensation by a mere
money standard, but fairly within the doctrine of the cases
wherein .exemplary damages have been allowed. Those allegations of the complaints,, though denied in the answers, have
been sustained by the tribunal-in these cases the court, a
jury having been waived - which -had to pass upon the issues
of fact.
That the amount of the recovery in each case fell short of
the sum of two thousand dollars did not withdraw the cases
from the jurisdiction of the court. As the declarations alleged
damages in the sum of, six thousand dollars, and'as a jury
would be at liberty to find any amount not in excess of that
sum, the jurisdiction, having once validly attached, would
not be defeated by the fact that the recoveries were for sums
less than two thousand dollars. As said in the case of Day v.
Woodworth, above cited, "The amount has always been left
to the discretion of the jury, as the degree of the punishment
to be then inflicted must depend on the particular circumstances of ,each case."
Barry v. Fdmunds, 116 U. S. 550, was a fully considered
case, and it was there held that a suit cannot properly be
dismissed by a Circuit Court of the United States as not
substantially irvolving & controversy within the jurisdiction
of the court, unless the facts, where made to appear on the
record, create a legal certainty of that conclusion, that where

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

exemplary damages beyond the sum' necessary to give a Circuit Court of the United States jurisdiction are claimed in an
action for a malicious trespass, the court should not dismiss
the case for want of jurisdiction simply because the record
shows that the actual injury caused to the plaintiff by the
trespass was less than the jurisdictional amount, and that
it is settled in this court that in an action for a trespass
accompanied with malice the plaintiff may recover exemplary
damages in excess of the amount of his injuries, if the ail
damnum is properly laid.
Our inquiries thus far have proceeded on the assumption
that the injuries complained of were inflicted in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law of the State. Sustaining the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court on that -assumption, we are
now brought to the more important and difficult question
whether the so called dispensary law of the State of South
Carolina is, indeed, as to some or all of its parts, invalid, as
being in conflict with the Constitution of the United States
and acts of Congress made thereunder 2 Is that statute a
lawful exercise of the police power of the State?
In the present discussion we do not deem it necessary or
desirable to review the numerous cases in which this court
has had occasion to consider similar questions. We shall find
it sufficient to apply to the case before us. the conclusions announced in several very recent cases.
The difficulty of the subject is shown in the frequent and
elaborate dissents in many of the cases. Still, it can be safely
said that the differences of opinion thus manifested have not
been so much upon fundamental principles, as upon questions
of the construction and meaning of the various state statutes
that have been under consideration. Tkiose statutes have
covered almost innumerable subjects, such as the exclusion
from the State of contagious or infectious diseases, or of criminals, paupers and others likely to become a burden or public
charge, regulations requiring railroad companies to fence
their roads, forbidding the manufacture and sale of oleomargarme, the prohibition of Sunday labor, even by railroad companies partly engaged in interstate commerce, etc.

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Opinion of the Court.

But the particular state laws that have been most frequently considered, and have occasioned the most discussion,
have been those that have sought to regulate or forbid the
importation, manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors.
And the law, whose validity we are now to consider, is one of
that class.
The evils attending the vice of intemperance in the use of
spirituous liquors are so great that a natural reluctance is felt
in appearing to interfere, even on constitutional grounds, with
any law whose avowed purpose is to restrict or prevent the
mischief. So long, however? as state legislation continues to
recognize wines, beer and spirituous liquors as articles of lawful consumption and commerce, so long must continue the
duty of the Federal courts to afford to such use and commerce
the same measure of protection, under the Constitution and
laws of the United States, as is given to other articles.
We cheerfully concede that the law in question was passed
in the bona fide exercise of the police power. We disclaim
any imputation to the law-makers of South Carolina of a design, under the guise of a domestic regulation, to interfere
with the rights and privileges of either her own citizens or
those of her sister States, which are secured to them by the
Constitution and laws of the United States.
But, as we have had more than one occasion to observe, our
willingness to believe that this statute was enacted in good
faith, and to protect the people of the State from the evils
of unrestricted importation, manufacture and sale of ardent
spirits, cannot control the final determination whether the
statute, in some of its provisions, is not repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States. As was said in Mugler
v. Kana8, 123 U. S. 623, 661 "If a statute purporting to
have been enacted to protect the public health, the public
morals or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation
to those objects, or is a palpable invasion of rights secured
by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution."
It is important to observe that the statute -before us does
not purport to prohibit either the importation, the manufac-

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

ture, the sale or the use of intoxicating liquors. The first
section does, indeed, make it penal to manufacture, sell,
barter, deliver, store or keep in possession any spirituous,
malt, vinous, fermented, brewed or other liquors, which contain alcohol, and are used as a beverage, and declares all such
liquors to be contraband and against the morals, good health
and safety of the State, and authorizes them, to be seized
wherever found, without warrant, and turned ever to the
state commissioner, yet those enactments are not absolute,
but are made subject to the subsequent provisions of the
act. When those subsequent provisions are examined, we
find that, so far from the importation, manufacture and sale
of such liquors being prohibited, those operations are turned
over to state functionaries, by whom alone, or under whose
direction, they are to be carried on.
Thus section three provides for the appointment of a state
commissioner, who is required to purchase all intoxicating liquors for lawful sale in the State, and to furnish the same to
such persons as may be designated as dispensers thereof, to be
sold as thereafter provided in the act. Such commissioner is
directed, before shipping the liquor to county dispensaries,
to cause the same to be.put up in sealed packages of not less
than one half pint nor more than five gallons, in which packages they shall be sold by county dispensers.
The fifteenth section enacts that "any person, firm, association or corporation desiring or intending to manufacture or
-distill any liquors containing alcohol within the State, shall
first obtain from the state board a permit or license to doso," and said section fufther provides "that manufacturers of
distilled, malt or vinous liquors who are doing business within
this State shall be allowed to sell to no person in this State
except the state commissioner and to parties outside the State,
and the state commissioner shall 'purchase his supplies from
the brewers and distillers in this State when their product
reaches the standard required by this, act Provmded, Such
supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and
distillers in this State as elsewhere." So, too, the twenty-third
section provides that "the state commissioner may enter into

SCOTT v. DONAILD.
Opinion of the Court.

contracts with responsible grape-growers in this State for the
sale of domestic wines through the dispensary, so as to encourage grape-growing in this State, -and in furtherance of
this subject not more than ten per cent profit to the dispensary over the expense of bottling, labelling, freighting, etc.,
shall be charged for the handling of such wines." But there
is no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.
And in cases of seizure of contraband liquors, the thirty-first
section provides that "the state commissioner shall have the
same tested by the state chemist, and if pure shall sell the
same through the state dispensary as though purchased by
him, and if not pure he shall sell the same beyond the State,
and deposit the proceeds to the credit of the state commissioner."
In view of these and similar provisions, it is indisputable
that whatever else may be said of this act, it was not intended
to prohibit the manufacture, sale and use of intoxicating
liquors. On the contrary, liquors and wines are recognized
as commodities which may be lawfully made, bought and
sold, and must therefore be deemed to be the subject of
foreign and interstate commerce.
It is sought to defend the act, as an inspection act, within
the meaning of that provision of the Constitution 6f the
United States which permits the States to impose excise
duties as far as they may be absolutely necessary for executing their inspection laws.
The act does, indeed, contain provisions looking to the
ascertainment of- the purity of liquors, and to that extent
may be said to be in the nature of an inspection law But
those provisions, such as they are, do not redeem the act
from the charge- of being an obstructin and interference
with foreign and interstate commerce. This aspect of the
question has bten several tuies considered by this court in
cases where similar attempts w.re made to sustain state
statutes as legitimate inspection laws.
In Railroad Co. v. Esu8en, 95 U. S. 465, the validity of an
act of the State of Missouri, which forbade the introduction

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

months of March and December of each and every year, was
-considered.
It was contended on behalf of the law that it was valid as
a quarantine or inspection law, as its purpose was to prevent
'the introduction of cattle afflicted with contagious diseases.
But the court pointed out that no provision was made for
the actual inspection of the cattle, so as to secure the rejection
-of those that were diseased, but that all importation of
-cattle, whether sound or diseased, was forbidden for long
periods, and it was held that the statute was void as a plain
.intrusion upon the exclusive domain of Congress.
Walling v Michigan, 116 U. S. 446, 459, 460, was a case
wherein was brought into question the validity of a statute of the
State of Michigan, which imposed a tax or duty on persons
who, not having their principal place of business within the
,State, engage in the business of selling liquors, to be shipped
into the State, and it was held that a discriminating tax
imposed by a State, operating to the disadvantage of the
products of other States when introduced into the first mentioned State, is, in effect, a regulation in restraint of commerce among the States, and as such -is a usurpation of the
power confirmed by the Constitution upon the Congress of
the United States. Answering the argument upon which
the law had been sustained by the Supreme Court of the
State, this court, through Mr. Justice Bradley, said "It is.
-suggested by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of
the Supreme Court of Michigan in this case, that the tax
imposed by the act of 1875 is an exercise by the legislature
of Michigan of the police power of the State for the discouragement of the use of intoxicating liquors, and the
preservation of the health and morals of the people. This
would be" a perfect justification of the act if it did not dis-crinmnate against the citizens and products of other States in a
matter of commerce between the States, and thus usurp one
of the prerogatives of the national legislature. The police
power cannot be set up to. control the, inhibitions of the
Federal Constitution, or the powers of the United States
governmeilt created thereby"

SCOTT v. DONAMD.
Opinion of the Court.

In 1886 the legislature of the State of Iowa passed an act

it is not a quarantine or sanitary law It is essentially a regulation of commerce among the States within any definition
heretofore given to that term, or which can be given, and
although its motive and purpose are to perfect the policy of
the State of Iowa in protecting its citizens against the evils
of intemperance, it is none the less on that account a regulation of commerce. If it had extended its provisions so as to
prohibit the introduction into the State from foreign countries
of all importations of intoxicating liquors produced abroad,
no one would doubt the nature of the provision as a regulation of foreign commerce. Its nature is not changed by its
application to commerce among the States.
And
here is the limit between the sovereign power of the state
and the Federal power. That is to say, that.which does not
belong to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the police
power of the State and that which does belong to commerce

which a right of traffic exists, and that being thus articles, of
commerce, a State cannot, in the absence of legislation on the
part of Congress, prohibit their importation from abroad or
from a sister State, nor when imported prohibit their sale by
the importer, and, accordingly, it was held that a statute of
the State of Iowa, prohibiting the sale of any intoxicating
liquors, except for pharmaceutical, medicinal, chemical or
sacramental purposes, and under a license from a county court
of the State, was, as applied to a sale by the importer, and m
the original packages or kegs, unbroken and unopened, of such
liquors manufactured and brought from another"State, unconstitutional and void, as repugnant to the clause of the Constitution granting to Congress the power to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and among the several States.
In Minnesota v Barber, 136 U. S. 313, 326, 328, the facts so
closely resemble those shown by the record now under consideration, and the principles stated in the opinion are so applicable, that we shall'state them with some particularity
A statute of the State of Minnesota, entitled "An act for
the protection of the public health by providing for inspection,
before slaughter, of cattle, sheep and swine designed for
slaughter for human food," in its first section prohibited the
sale of any fresh beef, veal, mutton, lamb or- pork for human
food in the State, except as subsequently provided in the act.
Boards of inspectors were there provided for, whose duty it
should be to inspect all cattle, sheep and swine slaughtered
for human food. It was made a matter of fine or imprisonment for any one to sell or expose for sale for human food
any fresh beef, mutton, lamb or pork which had not been so
inspected.
This court, in an opinion delivered by Mr. .lustice Harlan,
while conceding that the statute was enacted in good faith,
for-the purpose expressed.in the title, namely, to protect the
health of the people of Minnesota, held that, as the necessary
effect of the act was to deny altogether to the citizens of other
'States the privilege of selling, within the limits of Minnesota.
for human food, any fresh beef, mutton, veal or pork, from
animals slaughtered outside of the State, and to compel the

Opinion of the Court.

people of Minnesota, wishing to buy such meats, either to purchase those taken from animals -inspected and slaughtered in
the State, or to incur the cost of purchasing them, when desired for their own domestic use, at points beyond the State,
such legislation was void as constituting a discrimination
against the products and business of other States in favor of
the products and business of Minnesota, and as depriving the
people of Minnesota of the right to bring into that State, for
the purposes of sale and use, sound and healthy meat, wherever
such meat may have come into existence. It was said
"A law providing for the inspection of animals whose meats
are designed for human food cannot be regarded as a rightful
exertion of the police powers of the State, if the inspection
prescribed is of such a character, or is burdened with such
conditions, as will prevent altogether the introduction into
the State of sound meats, the products of animals slaughtered
in other States. It is one thing for a State to exclude from
its limits cattle, sheep or swine, actually diseased, or meats
that, by reason of their condition, or the condition of the ammals from which they are taken, are unfit for human food,
and punish all sales of such animals or of such meats within
its limits. It is quite a different thing for a State to declare,
as does Minnesota by the necessary operation of its statute,
that fresh beef, veal, mutton, lamb or pork-articles that are
used in every part of this country to support human lifeshall not be sold at all for human food within its limits, unless
the animal from which such meat is taken is inspected in that
State, or, as is practically said, unless the animal is slaughtered
in that State.
It is, however, .contended, in behalf of
the State, that there is in fact no interference by this statute,
with the bringing of cattle, sheep and swine into Minnesota
from other States, nor any discrimination against the products
and business of other States for the reason - such is the argu-

ment -that the statute requiring an inspection of animals on
the hoof, as a condition of the privilege of selling, or offering
for sale, in the State, the meats taken from them, is applicable
alike to all owners of such animals, whether citizens of Minnesota or citizens of other States. To this we answer, that a

statute may, upon its face, apply equally to the people of, all
the States, and yet be a regulation of interstate commerce
which a State may not establish. A burden imposed by a
State upon interstate commerce is not to be sustained simply
because the statute imposing it applies alike to the people of
all the States including the people of the State enacting such
statute. Robbm8s v. Shelby Ta=ng Dulmd, 120 U. S., 489,
497, Case of the State F'etg&t Tax, 15 Wall. 232. The people
of Minnesota have as much right to protection against the
enactments of that State, interfering with the freedom of
commerce among the States, as have the people of other
States. Although this statute is not avowedly, or in terms,
directed against the bringing into Minnesota of the products
of other States, its necessary effect is to burden or affect commerce with other States, as 'involved in the transportation
into that State, for the purposes of sale there, of. all fresh beef,
veal, mutton, lamb or pork, however free from disease may
have been the animals from- which it was taken."
The same reasoning *evailed 'in Brmner v. Rebman,.138
U. S. 78, wherein an act of the State of Virginia, which declared it to be unlawful to offer for sale, within the limits of
that State, any beef, veal or mutton from animals slaughtered
one hundred miles or more from the place at which it is offered for sale, unless it has been previously inspected and
approved by local inspectors, was held void, as being in restraint of commerce between the States, and as imposing a
discriminating tax upon the products and industries of some
States in favor of the products and industries of Virginia, and
wherein it was said " that the statute of Virginia, although
avowedly enacted -to- protect its people against the sale of
unwholesome meats, has no real or substantial relation to
such- an object, but, by its necessary operation, is a regulation
of commerce, beyond the power of the State to establish."
After the decision in Lewy v. Hardin, and, perhaps, in pursuance of some observations contained therein, Congress passed
the act of August 8, 1890, 26 Stat. 313, c. 728, enacting "that
all fermented, distilled or other intoxicating liquors, or liquids
transported into any State or Territory, or remaining therein

SCOTT v. DONALD.
Opinion of the Court.

for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and
effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the
exercise of its police powers to the same extent and in the
same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt
therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original
packagesor otherwise." This law was approved as valid, in
the case of In re .Rahrer,140 U. S. 545, and a provision of
the constitution of Kansas, which provided that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors shall be forever prohibited in that State, except for medicinal, scientific and
mechanical purposes, and an act passed in enforcement
thereof, making penal the manufacture, sale or barter of any
spirituous, malt, vinous, fermented or other intoxicating
liquors, were held to be efficacious, and that imported liquors
or liquids shall, upon arrival in a State, fall within the category of domestic articles of a similar nature.
In .Plumley v .Ma88achusetts, 155 U. S. 461, 471, and in
Emmert v. .Miour, 156 U. S. 296, in the first of which the
validity of a state law forbidding the manufacture and sale
of imitation butter, and in the second the validity of an act
compelling itinerant pedlers to take out licenses, were sustained, the scope and effect of the case of Iesy v. Bardin
and of the act of Congress of August 8, 1890, were considered
.and a full review of the cases heretofore cited was gone into
and their principles elaborately discussed.
In the light of these cases the act of South Carolina.of
January 2, 1895, must, as to those of its provisions which
affect -the plaintiff in the present suit, stand condemned.
It is not an inspection law The prohibition of the importation of the wines and liquors of other States by citizens of
South Carolina for their own use is made absolute, and does
not depend on the purity or impu, ,6y of the articles. Only
the state functionaries are permitted to import into the State,
and thus those citizens who wish to use foreign wines and
liquors are deprived of the exercise of their own judgment
and taste in the selection of commodities. To empower a

state chemist to pass upon what the law calls the "alcoholic
purity" of such importations by chemical analysis can
scarcely come within any definition of a reasonable inspection law
It is not a law purporting to forbid the importation, manufacture, sale and use of intoxicating liquors, as articles detrimental to the welfare of the State and to the health of the
inhabitants, and hence it is not within the scope and operation
of the act of Congress of August, 1890. That law was not
intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate
injuriously against the products of other States iL articles
whose manufacture and- use are not forbidden, and which are
therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce. When that law
provided that "all fermented, distilled or intoxicating liquors
transported into any State.or Territory, remaining therein for
use, consumption, sale or storage therein, should, upon arrival
in such State or Territory, be subject to the operation and effect
of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise
of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in
such State or Territory, and should. not be exempt therefrom
by reason of being introduced therein in original packages
or otherwise," evidently equality or uniformity of treatment
under state laws was intended. The question whether a given
state law is a lawful exercise of the police power is still open,
and must remain open, to .this court. Such a law may forbid
entirely the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors and
be valid. Or it may provide equal regulations for the inspection and sale of all domestic and imported liquors and
be valid. But the State cannot, under the Congressional
legislation referred to, establish a system which, in effect,
discriminates between interstate and domestic commerce in
commodities to make and use which are admitted to be
lawful.
Whether those provisions of the act which direct that so
called contraband liquors may be seized without warrant by
any state constable, sheriff or policeman, while in transit or
after arrival, whether in possession of a common carrier,

depot agent, express agent or private person, and which subject common carriers to fine and imprisonment for carrying
liquors in any package, cask, jug, box or other package, under
any other than ,the proper name or brand known to the trade,
and which forbid the bringing of any suit for damages alleged
to arise by seizing and detention of liquors under the act,
would be lawful in an inspection law otherwise valid, we do
not find it necessary to now consider. It was pressed on us,
in the argument, that it is not competent for a State, in the
exercise of its police power, to monopolize the traffic in intoxicating liquors, and thus put itself in competition with the
citizens of the other States.
This phase of the subject is novel and interesting, but we
do not think it necessary for us now to consider it. It is
sufficient for the present cases to hold, as we do, that when a
State recognizes the nianufacture, sale and use of ifitoxicating
liquors as lawful, it cannot discriminate against the bringing
of such articles in, and importing them from other States,
that such legislation is void as a hindrance to interstate com-merceand an unjust preference of the products of the enacting
State as against similar products of the other States.
There has been filed in the record a suggestion by the
.attorney general of the State of South Carolina that, since
the trials of these cases in the court below, there has been
passed by the general assembly of that State a further act
approved by the governor on March 6, 1896, which act it is
'submitted, supersedes and repeals parts of the act which has
been under consideration in these cases, and we are asked to
consider the provisions of the more recent act.
So far as these actions at law are concerned, it is, of course,
obvious that the damages recovered were for acts committed
under the alleged authority of the act of 1895, and cannot be
affected by the provisions of the act of 1896, even if the
invalidities of the former act were thereby remedied- a
matter on which we express no opinion.

I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court holding
the South Carolina dispensary law to be unconstitutional,, as
applied to the facts of this case. While I see no reason to
question the propriety of our rulings in the cases analyzed in
the opinion, of Railroad Co. v HUsen, 95 U S. 465, llinnesota v. Barber, 136 U S. 313, and Bri'mer v. Rebman, 138
U. S. 78, they do not seem to me to have any considerable
bearing upon the question in controversy, in view of the recent legislation by Congress upon the subject of intoxicating
liquors.
In Lez8y v Rardin, 135 U. S. 100, this court in April, 1890,
overruling the prior case of Pewroe v .NewHampshire,5 How
504, held that a state statute prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, and under license from
a county court, was, when applied to a sale by-an importer of
liquors brought from another State in the original packages,
unconstitutional and void, as repugnant to the power of Congress to regulate commerce. Following closely upon this
decision, and probably in consequence of it, Congress, upon
August 8 of the same year, enacted what is popularly known
as the "'Wilson bill," and declared that all such liquors transported into any State, or remaining there for use, consumption, sale or storage, .should, upon arrival be "subject to the
operation and effect of the laws of such State, enacted in the
exercise of its police powers," to the same extent as if they
had been- produced in such State.
The effect of this enactment seems to me to withdraw intoxicating liquors from the operation of the commerce clause of
the Constitution, and to permit the traffic in them to be regulated in such manner as the several States, in the exercise of
their police powers, shall deem best for the general interests
of the public. The act is not limited in its operation, as the
majority opinion seems to assume, to state laws forbidding the
importation, manufacture and sale of such liquors, but declares that they shall be subject, upon their arrival within the
State, to the operation of all its laws enacted in the exercise

SCOTT v. DONALD.

of its police powers. Adopting the very language of the act
of Congress, section 32 of the dispensary law provides "That
all fermented, distilled or other liquors or liquids containing
alcohol, transported into this State or remaining herein for
use, sale, consumption, storage or other disposition, shall, upon
introduction and arrival in this State, be subject to the operation and effect of this law, to the same extent and in the same
manner as though such liquors or liquids had been produced
in the State."
We cannot fail to recognize the growing sentiment in this
country in favor of some restrictions upon the sale of ardent
spirits, and whether such restrictions shall take the form of a
license tax upon dealers, a total prohibition of all manufacture or sale whatever, or the assumption by the state government of the power to supply all liquors to its inhabitants,
is a matter exclusively for the States to decide.
The first section of the dispensary law of South Carolina
declares that the manufacture, sale, receipt, acceptance or
keeping in possession of alcoholic liquors, excepiWhen bought
from a state officer authorized to sell the same, are declared
to be contraband, and against the morals, good health and
safety of the State, and may be seized' wherever found without warrant. Now, as Congress has expressly declared that
such articles shall, upon their arrival in the State, become
subject to its laws to the same extent as if they had been.
originally produced there, and, as the dispensary-act does not
declare them contraband as imported liquors, or because they
were imported, but because they were not bought from a
state officer authorized to sell the same, and as the law makes
no discrimination in that particular between imported and
domestic liquors, it is impossible for me to see why Congress
has not directly authorized the action that was taken by the
state officers in seizing these liquors. The power to declare
intoxicating, liquors to be contraband and to prohibit their
manufacture and sale m toto was affirmed by this court in
Hugler v. Kanezs, 123 U. S.623, and if the provision requiring them to be bought of the state dispensary be Yalid, it
applies as wpll to imported as to domestic liquors.

But, as I understand, the court bases to a certain extent its
opinion of the unconstitutionality of this act upon the fact
,that the traffic in intoxicating liquors is not absolutely prohibited, but is monopolized by the State itself through the
agency of a state commissioner, who is required (§ 3) to
"purchase all intoxicating liquors for lawful sale" in the
State, and to "furnish the same to such persons as may be
designated as dispensers thereof," to be sold as thereafter
providedun the act. Conceding this to be so, I am unable
to see that any provsionjof the Federal Constitution is
thereby infringed. The Constitution does, indeed, require
of each State. a republican form of government, and, in the
tenth section of the first article, imposes certain limitations
upon state action, none of which have any relevancy to the
subject under consideration. Except as restricted by the provisions of this section, the several state legislatures possess, so
far as any interference by the Federal government is concerned,
full legislative pqwers, and, with respect to the subject of intoxicating liquors, are, since the passage of the "Wilson bill,"
untrammelled by the Federal Constitution.
Granting that the act gives the State itself a monopoly of
all traffic &nsuch liquors, it is not a monopoly in the ordinary
or odious sense of the term, where one individual or corporation is .given- the right to manufacture or trpie which is not
open 'to other.s, but a monopoly for the benefit of the whole
people of the State, the profits of which, if any, are enjoyed
by the whole people ; in short, a monopoly in the same. sense
in which -the Post Office Department, and the right to carry
the mails, is a monopoly of the Federal government. Iowevs8em v..Evan8, 69 Fed. Rep. 908.

The only objections to the dispensary law which strike me
as being of any force ate the, provisions of the fifteenth and
twenty-third sections, requiring, the state commissioner to
purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in the
Spate, but even this. provision, though perhaps unwise, is
subject to two conditfons first, that their product shall reach
the standard requed by the act, and, second, that such supplies "bcan be purchased as cheaply from such brewers rand

SCOTT v. DONALD.

distillers in this State as elsewhere. As this restriction is
practically no restriction at all, and only incorporates in
the statute exactly what the law would imply without it, I
see no valid objection to it.
But even if it were conceded that this particular provision
of the law were inoperative, and might be so declared in a
case properly raising that question, it is not of the essence of
the law, but a mere incident to the power of the commissioner,
and surely should not have the sweeping effect of rendering
the whole law unconstitutional and void. The main object of
the act is to preserve the health and morals of the people by
securing to them pure liquors, prohibiting individual dealings
in such liquors, and requiring all such traffic to be carried on
through the agencies of the State. Such methods of dealing
with this traffic are by no means unknown abroad. Indeed,
I understand the act to be but the reproduction in this country of what is known as the Gothenberg system.
It is entirely well settled that the unconstitutionality of a
particular provision will not invalidate an entire statute,
unless such provision embodies the main purpose of the
statute, or is so connected with such purpose that it is inseparable from it, or, unless the court can see that the legislature
would not have passed the act without such provision. This
doctrine has been repeatedly affirmed by this court. Bank of
Hamilton,v. Dudley, 2 Pet. 492, Austin v The Aldermen,
7 Wall. 694, Packet Co. v .Heokuk, 95 U. S. 80. Indeed, in
Tiernan v Rinker, 102 U. S. 123, this court held an act of
the legislature of Texas, taxirfg intoxicating liquors, to be
inoperative only so far as it discriminated against imported
wines or beers, and that as defendant was also engaged in
selling other liquors, an injunction was properly refused.
That the provision that the commissioner in purchasing the
liquors shall give preference to those of domestic manufacture
is separable from the main purpose of the act seems to me too
clear for argument. That the legislature would have passed
the act without this provision is conclusively shown by the
fact that, in a general amendment and refnactment of this
law, made in 1896, this provsion was omitted.

While the power of courts to declare an act of legis.
lation to be unconstitutional undoubtedly exists, it is one of
great delicacy, particularly when brought to bear, upon the
legislative acts of another sovereignty In one of -he, early
cases decided by this court, Fether v Peck, 6 Cranch, 87,
128, it was said by Chief Justice Marshall "But it is not on
slight implication and vague conjecture that the legislature is
to be ronounced to have transcended its powers, and its acts
to be considered as void. The opposition between the Constitution and the law should be such that the judge feels a clear
and strong conviction of their incompatibility with each
other." Still more explicit is the language of Chief Justioe
Waite in the Sinkag .Fund case8, 99 U. S. 700, 718 "It is
our duty., when required in the regular course of judicial proceedings, to declare an act of Congress void if not within the
legislative power of the United States, but this declaration
should never be made except in a clear case. Every possible
-presumption is in favor of the.validity of a statute, and this
continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt.
One branch of the government cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depend in .no' small degree on a strict observance of this
salutary rule."
I regard these words as,particularly applicable to the dealings by this court with theoproceedings of a state legislature,
and that their right to deteminne what-is for the best interests
of their people should be -carefully respected, except where it
comes in manifest cotflit.witf-the dominant law. Especially
should everything be avoided, which carries the suggestion of
a vexatious interference -with state action. The manifest
dangers- to the future of.the country, which lurk in the inflexibility of the Federal Constitution, can only be averted
by carefully distinguishing between- such laws as practically
concern the inhabitants of a particular State only, and are
intended bona fide for their*welfare,:and such as are a mere
subterfuge for an unlgwful discrimination, and cannot be
carried into effect without doing palpable injustice to citizens
of otlir States. It should not be overlooked in this connec-

tion that the complaints in this case emanate from a citizen of
South Carolina, who seeks to defy the law of his own State,
and puts forward as his excuse the injustice done the citizens
of other States who make no complaint of her action in this
particular. If a State cannot prohibit her own citizens from
importing liquors, as well as buying them at home, the
"Wilson bill" is set at nought, and the prohibitory laws of
the several States rendered inoperative in a vital particular.
The fact that these liquors were imported for complainant's
own use and consumption, instead of for sale, raises no question
under the Federal Constitution. Both are under the ban of
the statute.
I am unable to see wherein that section of the dispensary
act of South Carolina, which authorized the seizure made in
tns case, conflicts in any particular with the Federal Constitution.
