as to fit them for any service connected with maritime life,
leaving them free to go-into the Navy, or into the merchant
marine. The instruction is in seamanship, navigation, .sailmaking and everything pertaining to iseaman's life.
The claimant, on January 1, 1891,reported to the commander of the St. Mary's, for duty as executive officer on
board of her, and there.served as such until October 24, 1893,
(the date of filing this petition,) in obedience to an order
signed by the Secretary of the Navy, dated- December 30,
1890, and i the usual form of orders assigning officers to
duty on school ships, as follows
"Navy Department, Washington, December 30, 1890. Sir"
You are detached from the Minnesota on the 31st instant,
and -will report to -Conimander A. S. Crowninshield on the
same day for duty as executive on board the nautical school
ship St. Mary's as the-relief of Lieut. C. 0. Cornwell. This
-employment on shore duty is required-by the public interests,
and such setvice will continue until the 31st of December,
1893; ulkss'it is otherwise ordered."
TAnougliout the claimant's service on the St. Mary's, he
received no orders, except from her commander, an officer
of the Navy, --and through him his junior officers received
the orders of the commander. Her complement of officers
was the commander, the executive officer, a lieutenant, an
ensign and a surgeon. Her crew consisted of twenty-two
ernment for the rdquisite use of vessels and supplies for the purpose
above. mentioned.

men of different grades and ranks, .all employed by the city
of New York. Her commander was required by .the regulations of the Navy to report semi-annually to the Secretary
of the Navy upon the conduct and professional ability of
his subordinate officers, and upon the efficacy of the men.
The St. Mary's, each year, went upon a cruise, lasting from
about the middle of May to some time in October; and during the rest of the year was attached to a dock in the harbor
of New York. While she was not cruising, the claimant
lived on board, and was on duty on board every day, wearing
his uniform, and doing the same duty, and subject to the
same regulations, as while the ship was on the high seas, and
in the matter of quarters, mess and uniform, there was no
difference, whether the vessel was under sail, or lying at
anchor, or tied to a wharf. The claimant's duties as executive officer were the care and preservation of the ship, looking
after the crew, and attending to the details of the organization and police of the ship.
The claimant also acted as instructor of the pupils of the
nautical school on board the St. Mary's, and was paid for
his services in that capacity by the board of education of the
city of New York.
In the routine of the Navy Department, officers are usually
assigned alternately to sea and shore duty for periods of about
three years each. For two and a half years prior to December 31, 1890, the claimant had been attached to the United
States steamship Galena, on a cruise, performing sea duty and
receiving sea pay
The claimant had been in the Navy since 1872, and during
his service on the St. M1ary's was entitled to $2600 a year
while on sea duty, and $22(10 while on shore duty
The
accounting officers of the United States allowed him- sea
pay while the St. Mlary's was on a cruise, but only shore pay
while she was lying at a. wharf in the harbor of New York.
The Court of Claims held that he was entitled to sea pay
during the whole time of his service on the St. Mary's, and
gave judgment accordingly in his favor for $780.25. 30 C. 01.

GRAY,

after stating the case, delivered the opin-

ion of the court.
By the statute of the United States, the officers of the Navy
receive higher pay "when at sea," than when "on shore duty,"
or "on leave, or waiting orders", and the pay of the claimant,
being in the second five years of his service as lieutenant, was
"when at sea, $2600, on shore duty, $2200, on leave, or waiting orders, $1800." Rev. Stat. § 1556. And by § 1571, "no
service shall be regarded as sea service, except such as shall
be performed at sea, under the orders of a Department, and
in vessels employed by authority of law"
To constitute sea service, then, three things, and three only,
The service must be performed "at sea",
are necessary
"under the orders of a Department", and "1in vessels employed by authority of law"
In ordler to come within the phrase "at sea," as used in this
statute, it is not necessary that the vessel upon which the service is performed should' be upon the high seas. It is enough
that she is waterborne, even if at anchor in a bay, or port or
harbor, and not in condition pFesently to go to sea. It has
accordingly been adjihdgedf-by this court that a vessel is "at
sea,"within the meaning of the statute, although she is used
as a training ship, anchored in a bay, and not in a condition
to be taken out to sea, beyond the main land, or is used as a
receiviiig ship, at anchor in port at a navy yard,. communicating with the shore by a rope, and having a roof built over her
deck, and not tpchnically in commission for sea service.
United States v. Symonds, 120 U. S. 46, United States v.
B ihop; 120 U S. 51, United States v Strong, 125 U. S. 656.
The claimant, whilq_ the St. Mary's was not on a cruise, but
anchored- at and tied to a wharf in the harbor of Neew York,
lived on board of her, wore his uniform, and was subject to

UNITED STATES v. BARNETTE.
Opinion of the Court.

the same regulations, as while she was upon the high seas,
and was therefore "at sea," so far as affected his rate of pay,
during the whole period of his service as her executive officer.
The fact that this service was called, in the order of the Secretary of the Navy assigning him to duty upon this vessel,
"employment on shore duty," is immaterial. The material
question is whether the service was, in fact, performed at sea,
and not on shore, and not upon the name by which the Secretary of the Navy was pleased to designate it. As was said
by this court in United States v Synion ds, above cited, "Congress certainly did not intend to confer authority upon the
Secretary of the Navy to diminish an officer's compensation,
as established by law, by declaring that to be shore service
which was in fact sea service, or to increase his compensation
by declaring that to be sea service which was in fact shore
service." 120 U. S. 49.
The service of the claimant was clearly performed "under
the orders of a Department." It was in obedience to an order
of the Department of the Navy, that he reported to the commander of the St. Mary's, and served as her executive officer;
and, throughout his service upon her, he received no orders,
except from her commander, himself an officer in the Navy
As was well said by Judge Nott, now Chief Justice of the
Court of Claims, in delivering the opinion of that court in the
case at bar, "The order which placed the St. Mary's on duty
as a school ship, and, to a certain extent, at the disposal of the
board of education, did not transfer the vessel to any other
authority than that of the United States. Possession, control,
discipline and authority were all retained by the Government;
The officers doubtless carried out the directions of the board
of education, but they did not do so because they were the
orders of the board of education, but because they were sent
by the Secretary of the Navy to New York to do so." 30

C. Cl. 207.
It is no less clear that the St. Mfary's was one of the "vessels
employed by authority of law" by the United States. The
Court of Claims has distinctly found, as a fact, that she was
"a sailing vessel owned and employed by the United States."

OCTOBER TERIM, 1896.
Syllabus.

Both the furnishing of the St. Mary's by the Secretary of the
Navy to the-State of New York for a ship to maintain a nautical school upon, and the detail of the claimant as executive
officer of the vessel while she was used for that purpose, were
pursuant to the powers expressly conferred upon the President
of the United States and the Secretary of the Navy by the
act of Congress, entitled "An act to encourage the establishment of public marine schools." Act of June 20, 18,74, c. 339,
18 Stat. 121.
The duties of executive officer of the St. Mary's having been
perfoymed by the claimant as a lieutenant in the Navy of the
United States, at sea, under the orders of the Department of
the Navy, and in a vessel employed by the United States by
authority of law, he was entitled, during the whole period of
his service, whether the vessel was attached to a wharf, or was
sailing on a cruise, to the rate of pay which the statute allowed
to him "when at sea," notvithstanding that during the same
period he also received pay from the State of New York for
the performance of the distinct, but quite consistent, duties of
instructor in its nautical school upon this vessel, the performance of which, indeed, by naval officers, was manifestly contemplated and intended by the act of Congress, and by the
orders of the Secretary of the Navy
Judgment affirmed.

M . JUSTICE FIELD and Mr. JUSTICE BnEWER took no part
in the consideration and decision of this case.
