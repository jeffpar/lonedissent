kil6s (2.28 cents per pound).
"If we are to investigate the reasons which may impel Russian manufacturers to produce more sugar than is needed for
home, consumption, and to bring the surplus for exportation
down to a comparatively much lower price, we shall find the
explanation of this strange phenomenon in the legislative system of Russia. Such is our intimate conviction."
The object of issuing certificates of sugar exported seems to
have been merely to enable the exporting manufacturer to" obtain the best price for the privilege he assigns to the interior
manufacturer of putting an equal amount of free sugar upon
the market by assigning the certificates to the one who would
offer the best price. In this connection the Circuit Court of
Appeals found "That the Russian exporter of sugar obtained
from his government a certificate, solely because of such exportation, which is worth in the open market of that country
from R. 1.25 to R. 1.64 per pood, or from 1.8 to 2.35 cents per
pound. Therefore we hold that the government of Russia
does secure to the exporter of that country, as the inevitable
result of its action, a money reward or gratuity whenever he
exports sugar from Russia." We all concur in this expression
of opinion.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is, therefore,
Af kned.

WORDEN v. CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP COMPA.NY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT. COURT OF APPEALS FOR TEE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 386. Argued March 18, 19, 1902.-Decided January 5, 1903.

When the owner of a trace mark applies for an injunction to restrain the
defendant from injuring his property by making false representations
to the public it is essential that the plaintiff should not in his trade mark
or m his advertisements and business, be himself guilty of any false or
misleading representation, and if he makes any material false statement

-n connection with the property which he seeks to protect, he loses his
right to claim the assistance of a iourtof equity; and where any symbol
or label claimed as a trade mark is so constructed or worded as to make
or contain a distinct material assertion which is false, no property can
be claimed on it, or, in other words, the right to the exclusive use of it
jcannot be maintained.

ON June 1, 1897, the-California Fig Syrup Company, created
under the laws of the State of Nevada, and ha'ving its principal
place of business in San Francisco, -California, filed a bill in
equity in the Circuit Conrt of the United States for the Northern Distrit"of California, against Clinton E. Worden & Company, a cbrporation of the State of California, and against J
A. Bright, T. F Bacon, C. J.Schmelz and Lucius Little, citizens of the-State of California.
The bill alleged that, in the year 1879, one Richard E. Queen
invented "a certain medical preparation or remedy for constipation and to act upon the kidneys, liver, stomach and bowels,
which medical compound is a combination in solution of plants
known to be.benfeficial to the humau'system, forming an agreeable and effective laxative to cure habitual constipation and
many ills, de~ending upon a weak and inactive condition of the
liver, kidneys, stomach and bowels," that shoftly after the
said invention- the said Queen sold and transferred all his right,
title and interest in and to said medical compound, and inand
to the trade name, trade -marks.and good will of said company
to the complainant company, which has ever since been engaged in the manufacture and sale- of said medical preparation
-or remedy, that said medical preparabon has always been
marked, named and called by the complainant 11Syrup of Pigs,"

carton, and on the border within which, at the top, is a representation of a branch of a fig tree, bearing fruit and leaves,
surrounded by the words "Fig Syrup Company," or "Califorma
Fig Syrup Company," and below which appear, in large letters,
the words "Syrup of Figs," and below these last-named words
appears a brief statement of the virtues of this preparation, together with the words "Manufactured only by the California
Fig Syrup Company," that the complainant has spent more
than one million dollars in advertising said preparation, always
under the name of "Syrup of Figs," or "Fig Syrup," throughout the United States and other countries, and that millions of
bottles of said preparation have been sold, that, by virtue of
the premises, the complainant has acquired the exclusive right
to the name, "Syrup of Figs," or "Fig Syrup," as it is mdifferently called by the'ublic, or any colorable imitation of
the same, as applied to a liquid laxative medical preparation
irrespective of the form of bottle or package in which it may
I'e sold to the public; that, by virtue of the premises, the complainant has acquired the exclusive right to the manner and
form of packing the same for sale, in connection with the words
"Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," or any colorable- imitation
of the same, as a part of the business name of a concern making a liquid laxative medical compound.
The bill charges that the defendant company, wishing to trade
to its own profit and advantage upon the reputation of the complainant's preparation, and desiring to ifipose a worthless productiohi upon the public, has caused to be made, put up and sold,
and offered for sale, a liquid lafative medical compound, resembling complainant7s preparation, under the name "Syrup of
Figs" and "Fig Syrup," and marking the boxes and packages
containing the same with the name " .Fig Syrup" or "Syrup of
Figs," and has.put the preparation, under said name, in bottles
and packages or cartons, so closely m imitation of. the complainait's bottles and packages, as to be likely to deceive .Purchaser-, and so as to enable unscrupulous retail dealers to palm
off defendant's preparation on the consumers as and for the
complainant's preparation, and that purchasers frequently
have been deceived and induced to. buy the compound prepared

Statement of the Case.

by the defendant, that the complainant has been greatly m:ured in the business in the manufacture of its liquid laxative
preparation "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," and believes
that it has suffered damage and injury by reason of defendant's
acts to the extent of at least ten thousand dollars, that this is
a continuing wrong, and one which it is impossible to exactly
calculate, and one which, if permitted to continue, will work
irreparable injury to the complainant.
Wherefore the complainant prayed, in its said bill, for an injunction restraining the defendant and its agents, servants, etc.,
from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale, directly or indirectly, any liquid laxative medical preparation, marked with
the words "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," or marked with
any words which may be a colorable imitation of the name of
"Syrup of Figs" or" Fig Syrup," and from putting up, selling or
dealing m any liquid laxative medical preparation which shall
have a tenden6y to deceive the public and induce buyers to
purchase defendant's preparation, believing the same to be complaiant's preparation, and that defendant be perpetually enjoined from using the words "Fig Syrup Company" as a business name, or from using the words "Fig Syrup" or "Syrup
of Figs" as part of its business name, in connection with the
manufacture and sale of a liquid laxative preparation. The
complainant also prayed for an account for damages to complainant and for gains and profits derived by the defendant
company, and for such other and further relief as may be agreeable to equity and good conscience.
The defendant company and the other defendants filed a joint
and several answer, admitting many of the allegations of the
bill, but denying and putting the complainant on proof of those
which alleged any intentional or actual appropriation by the
defendant company of proprietory or business rights of the
complainant. The answer -proceeded to make the following
allegations:
"And, for a separate and further defence, these defendants
aver, upon their information and belief, that the preparation
made and sold by complainant under the name of 'Syrup of
Figs' does, not and never did contain any syrup of figs or any

of figs in any form, and that the name ' Syrup of Figs' and
'Fig Syrup' and the name of the company, 'The California
Fig Company,' and the form and appearance of the labels and
the pictures on the labels, and the statements on the labels
adopted and used by complainant in connection with its liqmd
laxative medicine, were all designed, adopted and used with
the deliberate intent and purpose to deceive the public and the
user of the medicine and to perpetrate a fraud upon them br
inducing them to believe that the preparation contained figs in
some form, and that by reason thereof the said medicine derived
its laxative properties and also a pleasant and agreeable taste;
that the complainant has been successful m perpetrating the
said fraud upon the public and 'for years ast past has perpetrated
said fraud by wholesale and have inducea the public generally
throughout the world to believe the statements aforesaid concermng the said medicine and its connection with fin, and
thereby complainant has made and realized large profits, gains
and advantages from the sale of said medicine, all of which was
caused and which accrued and were made by reason of said
false. fraudulent and deceptive statements, that, as a matter of
fact the said so-called 'Syrup of Figs,' sold by complainant,
consists of the ordinary and well-known laxative called senna
as a basis, together with certain aromatic carminatives added
for the purpose of giving it a pleasant and agreeable taste, as a
cure to the naturally griping' effect of senna when taken alone;
that in order to 'sell such a compound complainant made the
false, fraudulent and fictitious statements heremabove charged
against it, and was enabled to 'sell the same solely by virtue of
said false, fraudulent and fictitious statements, and said complainant has built up its business and its trade upon the strength
of and by virtue of the said- false,. fraudulent and fictitious
statements, for which reason complainant is not entitled to relief in a court of equity."

A large amount of evidence was taken, and, on June 7, 1899,

neither event can they be appropriated as a trade mark.

grossly deceived by that statement, purchasing a concoction of
drugs under the belief that they were purchasing a liquid fruit
remedy, (then reciting fortnulo). The medicine is nothing more
than a decoction of senna mixed with sugar, water, flavoring
extracts and a little ginger to prevent griping. CaliornmaBig

not made from figs, does not overcome habitual constipation
and the small quantity of juice of figs does not promote a pleasant taste or add anything to the medicine, again citing the
cases already cited under the previous points and Siege;rt v.
Abbott, 61 Maryland, 276.

The lower court erred in holding there had been unfair competition in trade by reason of simulated labels and wrappers.
There is no showing that any one has ever been actually deceived, but even if there were such similarity between the labels
of the appellant and appellee as to entitle the appellee to an
injunction on the score of unfair, competition, the appellee is
disentitled to any such relief by reason of its fraudulent representations and practices regarding its medicine. If there be
fraud on the part of a complainant he is not entitled to protection for his label any more than for his trade mark. Inthis respect both stand on the same footing.
There should in no event be any accounting as there is no
allegation in the bill that the defendants (appellants) have ever
realized any profits from the infringement.
Prior adjudications in other circuits clearly establish the fact
that the appellees are not entitled to any relief.
.X2' Jolo G Ca'lisle and 21ft. Warren Olney for respondent.
The lower court was right upon the doctrine of unfaer corn.etition.
It was proven here that the name was a true and honest
name when applied to the medicine, and the wording on the
cartons, criticized in other cases between the parties, was entirely eliminated long before the appellant flooded the Pacific
coast with its counterfeits. Respondent, plaintiff below, has
a standing in court, and the maxim relied upon by the appellant as to coming into court with clean hands does not apply in
this case.
The inventor used senna as a basis for a liquid cathartic,
overcoming the bitter taste and eliminating the griping quality with figs and named it "Syrup of Figs," and at first figs
were uniformly used.
Among pharmacists and physicians a formula set out in the

OCTOBER TERM; 1902.
Argument for Respondent.

U. S. Pharmacopla, to which a name has been given, becomes
official and a recognized article. This preparation could not
be called "Syrup of Senna," as there was an official formula
for such a preparation, and as this was not made in accordance
with such formula, physicians would have refused it recognition, so it was called "Syrup of Figs," and the record shows
that the medical profession endorsed it and have not objected
to the name. As figs were freely used it was natural to name
the preparation "Syrup of Figs." There was no fraud. The
reduction of figs was after the name had been given in good
faith and after the demand required the manufacture of the
article in large quantities.
Reversing this judgment will result in flooding the market
with all kinds of nostrums under the name of "Syrup of Figs,"
will ruin the complainant and injure the public, and the only
effect will be to enable the appellant to commit a fraud.
Where a man has an established business which he is seeking
to protect from unfair competition, he should be given relief if
he can make any reasonable explanation of statements claimed
to be false,, and he is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt.

_MR. JUSTICE SHInAS, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

WORDEN v. CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP CO.
Opinion of the Court

The courts below concluded, upon the evidence, that the defendants sold a medical preparation named, marked and packed,
in imitatlon of the complainant's medicine, for the purpose and
with the design and intent of deceiving purchasers and inducing them to buy defendants' preparation instead of the complainant's. We see no reason to dissent from that conclusion,
and if there were no other questions in the case, we should be
ready to affirm the decree, awarding a perpetual injunction and
an account of the profits and gains derivedfrom such unfair and
dishonest practices.
Another ground, however, is urged against the complainant's
right to invoke the aid of a court of equity, in that the Califorma Fig Syrup Company, the complainant, has so fraudulently
represented to the public the nature of its medical preparation
that.it is not entitled to equitable relief.
Some courts have gone so far as .to hold that courts of equity
will not interfere by injunction in controversies, between rival
manufacturers and dealers inso-called quack medicines. Fowle
v. .pear, Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Law- Journal, vol. 7,
p. 176, Heath-v WVrzght, 3 Wall. Jr. 141, Fetridgev. Wells, 4
Abb. Pr. 144.
It may be said, in support of such a view, that most, if not
all, the States of, this Union have- enactments forbiddink and
making penal the practice of mediciine by persons who have not
gone through a course of appropriate study, and obtained a
license from a board of examiners, and there is similar legislation 'in respect to pharmacists. And it would seem to be inconsistent, and to tend to defeat such salutary laws, if medical
preparations, often and usually containing powerful aiWdpoisonous drugs, are permitted to be widely advertised and sold to all
who are willing to purchase. Laws might properly be passed
limiting and controlling such traffic by restraining retail dealers
from selling such medical preparations, except when prescribed
by regular medical practitioners.
.iBut we think-that, in the absence of such legislation, courts
cannot declare dealing m such preparations to,be illegal, nor the
articles themselves to be not entitled, as property, to the protection of the law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1902.
Opinion of the Court.

We find, however, more solidity in the contention, on behalf
of the appellants, that when the owner of a trade mark applies
for an injunction to restrain the defendant from injuring his
property by making false representations to the public, it is
essential that the plaintiff should not m his trade mark, or m
his advertisements and business, be himself guilty of any false
or misleading representation, that if the plaintiff makes any
material false statement in connection with the property which
-he seeks.to protect, he loses his right to claim the assistance of
a court of equity, that where any symbol or label claimed as
a trade mark is so constructed or worded as to make or contain
a distiact assertion which is false, no property can be claimed
on it, or, in other words, the right to the exclusive use of it
cannot be maintained.
Among the cases cited to sustain this contention are the following
In Connell v Reed, 128 IMassachusetts, 4'IV, the plaintiff
sought to establish the exclusive right to the words "East Indian," as applied to his remedy and the court, through Gray, 0. J.,

this bill would be to lend the aid of the court to a scheme to
defraud the public."
In Siegert v Abott, 61 Maryland, 2T6, where the subject
matter of the trade mark was "Angostura Bitters," which purported to have been prepared by Dr. Siegert, at Angostura,
Trinidad, and where it appeared that Dr. Siegert was dead, and
had never lived at Angostura, the' bill was dismissed, the court
saying "It isa general rule of law, in cases of this kind, that
courts of equity will not interfere by injunction where there is
any laelkof truth in the plaintiff's case, that is, where there is
any misrepresentation in his trade mark or labels."
In Aden,v. Gros, 25 Mo. App. 123, a trade mark was claimed
in the words "Fruit Vinegar," and the court said -

be a novel application of the rule governing the subject of trade
marks, if one who manufactures vinegar out of cereals could
appropriate for the article thus manufactured the word ' Fruit,'
and thereby exclude another from using the word as descriptive

tion, is purely indicative of the character or quality of the article or not, the plaintiffs' exclusive claim to it must fail on the
further ground, that the use of the word, in that connection,
is clearly deceptive."
In Prznce .fanufactuwing Company v Prnce's .1etaZ]c
Pamnt, 135 N. Y 24, an injunction to protect a trade mark was
rdfused, by reason of a false representation as to the place from
which the ore was obtained, and the Court of Appeals used the
following language
"Any material misrepresentation. in a label or trade mark as
to the person by whom the article is manufactured, -or as to the
place where manufactured, or as to the materials composing it,
or any other material false representation, deprives a party of
the right to relief in equity The courts do not, in such cases,
take into consideration the attitude of the defendant.
And, although. the false article is as good as the true one, ' the
privilege of deceiving the public even for their own benefit is
not a legitimate subject of commerce.'"
English cases are to the same effect. Thus in Pidding v.
How, 8 Simons, 477, where it appeared that the plaintiff had
made a new sort of mixed tea, and sold it under the name of
"Howqua's Mixture," but, as he had made false statements to
the public, as to the teas, of which his mixture -was composed,
and as to the mode in which they were procured, the court refused to restrain the defendant from selling tea under the same
name, and said
"As between the plaintiff and the defendant, the course pursued by the defendant has not been a proper one ,. but it is a

clear rule, laid down by courts of equity, not to extend their
protection to persons whose case is not founded in truth. And,
as the plaintiff, in this case, has thought lit to mix up that which
may be true with that which is false, in introducing his tea to
the public, my opinion is, that, unless he establish his title at
law, the court cannot interfere on his behalf."
The English case-of Letthe ClCoth (. v Amwmcan Leather
Oloth Co. is a leading one on this subject and in which the nature of false representations that will defeat the right of the
owner of a trade mark to protection in equity was much considered.
A bill, asking for an injunction against defendants who were
charged with using stamps and trade marks, so similar to those
of the complainant as to deceive purchasers, was sustained by
Vice Chancellor Wood, who granted the injunction prayedfor.
1 Hem. & Miller's Reports, 271. On appeal the decree of the
Vice Chancellor was reversed by the Lord Chancellor, and the
complainant's bill was dismissed. 4 De Gex, J & S. 137.
The conclusions reached by Lord Chancellor Westbury were
that there is a right of property in a trade mark, name or symbol in connection with a particular manufacture or vendible commodity, but that where the owner of, such a trade mark applies
for an injunction to restrain the defendant from injuring his
property by making false representations to the public, it is
essential that the plaintiff should not in his trade mark or in
the business connected with it be himself guilty of any false
or misleading representation. In considering what constitutes
a material false representation, the Chancellor observed that
he could not receive it as a rule, either of morality or equity,
that a plaintiff is not answerable for a falsehood, because it
may be so gross and palpable as that no one is likely to be de.
ceived by it, that if there be a wilful false statement, he would
not stop to inquire whether it be too gross to mislead.
This,decision. was affirmed by the House of Lords. 11 H. L.
Cas. 523. In that tribunal, in the several opinions of the lawlords, the views of the Lord Chancellor as to the effect of false
representations were approved, but it was thought that, Mdependently of that question, the plaintiff was not entitled to an

injunction, because the rival or antagonistic trade mark of the
defendants did not sufficiently resemble that of the plaintiff's
as to be calculated to deceive the public.
In _Fetrzdge v. Welts,. 13 How .Pr. 385, the plaintiff sold a
soap under the name of "Balm of a Thousand Flowers," and
m denying the plaintiff's right to the exclusive use of these
words as a trade mark, Judge Duer said

the complainant claimed to be the owner of a patent medicine
and of a trade mark to distinguish it. The medicine was
manufactured by the complainant in New York, the trade
mark declared that it was manufactured by another person in
Massachusetts. The Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Maine, per Mr. Justice Clifford, held that the
complainant, owing to false statements in his trade mark, was
entitled to no relief against a person using the same trade
mark in Maine, and dismissed the bill. On appeal this decree
was affirmed, this court saying "A court of equity will extend
no aid to sustain a claim to a trade mark of an article which is
put forth[ with a misrepresentation to the public as to the
manufacturer of the article, and as to the place where it is
manufactured, both of which particulars were-originally circumstances to guide the purchaser of the medicine."
In Clotworthy v Schepp, 42 Fed. Rep. 62, the right to a
trade mark was claimed in the word "Puddine," in connection
with the Words "Rose" and "Vanilla," but Circuit Judge
Lacombe refused' an injunction, and in his opinion said "The
complainant hi pself is -engaged in deceiving the very public
whom he claims to protect from the deception of others. He
calls his preparation 'fruit' puddine. In nine different places
on his package this word ' fruit' is i 3peated, as descriptive of
the article, and a dish of fruit (pears, grapes, etc.) is most
prominently depicted on one face of each packet. His packages plainly suggest that fruit of some kind enters in some
shape into his compound. A chemical analysis produced by
defendant, the substantial accuracy of which is not disputed,
discloses the fact that his ' puddine' is composed exclusively of
corn starch, a small amount of saccharine matter, and a flavoring extract, with a little carmine added to give it color, it
contains no fruit in any form."

a trade mark thus fraudulently used."
And this doctrine of the English and American cases above
referred to has been applied in the Federal Circuit Courts and
Circuit Courts of Appeals in cases in winch the California Syrup
Company, the complainant in the present case, was a party
In the Circuit Court of the "United States for the District of

stated by Circuit Judge.jColt in'his opinion, reported in 66 Fed.

imitated the plaintiffs labels or packages except in this particular. If this preparation is in fact a syrup of figs, the words
are clearly descriptive, and not the proper subject of'a trade
mark. Upon this point the contention of the plaintiff is that
its preparation is not a syrup of figs, since it contains only a
very small percentage of the juice of the fig; that the laxative
ingredient in it is senna, that- while the fig in the form of fruit
may have laxative properties arising from the seeds and skin,
the fig in the. form of a syrup is no more laxative than any other
fruit syrup, that it follows from these facts that these words,
as applied to this compound, are not descriptive, but purely
fanciful, and therefore constitute a valid trade mark. The evi,
dence shows that the compound is not a syrup of figs. It might
more properly be termed a Syrup of'Senna,' if the words were
intended to be descriptive of the article. But, assuming this is
not a syrup of figs, we are met with the inquiry whether these
words, as applied to this preparation are not deceptive. The
label on every bottle reads as follows "Syrup of Figs. The
California Liquid Fruit Remedy Gentle and Effective.' On
the sides of each bottle are blown the words ' Syrup of Figs,'

Opinion of the Court.

and on the back the words ' California Fig Syrup Co., San Francisco, Cal.' On the face of every package is a picture of a
branch of a fig tree with the hanging fruit, surrounded with the
words ' California Fig Syrup, San Francisco, Cal., ' and beneath
this the words 'Syrup of Figs presents in the most elegant form
the laxative and nutritious juice of the figs of California.'
Thus we see that the leading representation on the labels, packages, and in the advertisements of this preparation is that it is a
laxative fruit syrup made from the juice of the California fig.
The popularity of this medicine arises from the belief
in the mind of the ordinary purchaser that he is buying a laxative compound, the essential ingredient of which is the California fig, wlereas, in fact, he is buying a medicine the active property of which issenna. The ethical principle on which the law
of trade marks is based will not permit-of any such deception.
It may be true, as a scientific fadl known to physicians and
pharmacists, that the syrup of figs has little or no laxative property, but this is not the belief of the general public. They purchase this preparation on the faith that it is a laxative compound
made from the fruit of the fig, which is false. This is not an
immaterial representation the effect of which is harmless, but
it is a representation which goes to the very essence of the plaintiff's right to a trade mark in these words. The cases are nuinerous where the courts have refused to grant relief under these
circumstances."
Accordingly, the Circuit Court dismissed the bill with costs.
On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
the decree of the Circuit Court was affirmed.
In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of Michigan, April 1, 1895, the California Fig Syrup
Company filed a bill, seeking to restrain Frederick Stearns &
Company from infringing complainant's trade mark. The court
declined to grant an mjunctmon and dismissed the bill with costs,
holding that the words "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," if
descriptive of a syrup, one of the characteristic ingredients of
which is the juice of the fig, cannot be sustained as a valid trade
mark or trade name, and that, under the facts of the case, the
use of the name "Syrup of Figs, in connection with a descrip-

tion of the preparation as a fruit remedy, nature's pleasant
laxative," applied to a compound, whose active ingredient is
senna, and containing but a small proportion of fig juice, which
has no considerable laxative properties, is deceptive and deprives one so using it of any claim to equitable relief.
On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit the decree of the Circuit Court was affirmed. 73 Fed. Rep.
812. In his opinion Circuit Judge Taft, after stating that the
term "Syrup of Figs," if intended to describe the character of
the article concerned, could not be used as a trade mark, proceeded to say
"But the second ground presented, and that upon which the
court below rested its decision, prevents the complainant.from
having any relief at all. That ground is that the complainant
has built up its business and made it valuable by an intentional
deceit of the public. It has intended the public to understand
that the preparation which it sells has, as an important medicinal agent in its composition, the juice of California figs. This
has undoubtedly led the public into the purchase of the preparation. The statembit is wholly untrue. Just a suspicion of fig
juice has been put into the preparation, not for the purpose of
changing its medicinal character, or.even its flavor, but merely
to give a weak support to the statement that the article sold is
syrup of figs. This is a fraud upon the public. It is true, it
may be a harmless humbug to palm off upon the public as syrup
of figs what is syrup of senna, but it is nevertheless of such a
character that a court of equity will not encourage it by extending any relief to the person who seeks to protect a business
which has grown out of and is dependent upon such deceit.
It is well settled that if a person wishes his trade mark property
to be protected by a court of equity, he must come into court
with clean hands, and if it appears that the trade mark for
which he seeks protection is itself a misrepresentation to the
public, and has acquired a value with the public by fraudulent
misrepresentation in advertisements, all relief will be denied
to him. This is the doctrine of the highest court of England,
and no court has laid it down with any greater stringency than
the Supreme Court of the United States. .Aedimne Co. v

"The argument for complainant is that, because fig juice or
syrup has no laxative property, everybody ought to understand
that when the term is used to designate a laxative medicine it
must have only a fanciful meaning. But the fact is admitted
that the public believe that fig juice or syrup has laxative
medicinal properties. It is to them that the complainant seeks
to sell its preparation, and it is with respect to their knowledge
and impressions that the character, whether descriptive or
fanciful, of the term used, is to be determined."
The, counsel of the appellee in the present case do not contend
that the- courts of the Second and Sixth Circuits were wrong in
denying the complainant any relief upon the cases as presented
in those courts. They do contend that those cases were argued
upon a wrong theory by the counsel of the complainant. The
language of the brief in this regard is as follows
"Here was where complainant made a mistake. Acting
under advice of able counsel, it claimed the name ' Syrup Figs'
to be a technical trade mark, when all that was necessary to
claim was that it constituted a trade name. Able counsel m
the Second and Sixth Circuits pressed injunction suits against
infringers on the theory that complainant had a trade mark m
the name, and that the statement on the cartons -and bottles
was immaterial. He did not address himself to showing that
the name ' Syrup of Figs ' came to be honestly and properly
applied to the product as largely descriptive of the ingredients
of the medicine. He was so afraid of ruining his case as a case
of trade marks, by showing that it was descriptive, that he did
not prove what was proved in the case now at bar, viz., that figs
were at the time the name was given an important part of the
composition."
We are not much impressed with the force of this attempted
distinction. Even if it were true that, at the time the medicine
in question was first made and put upon the market, the juice
of figs was so largely used as one of the ingredients, as to have
warranted the adoption of the name "Syrup of Figs" as descriptive of the nature of the medicine, that would be no justification

WORDEN v. CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP CO.
Opimon of the Court.

for continuing the use of the,term after the manufacturers and
vendors of the medicine ceased to use fig juice as a material ingredient. Even if the term was honestly applied in the first
instance, as descriptive, it would none the less be deceptive and
misleading when, as is shown in ihe present case, it ceased to

are we disposed to concede that, under the evidence in the
present case, the term "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup" was
properly used as descriptive of the nature of the medicine when
it was first made. Then, as now, the operative laxative element
was senna, and the addition of fig juice was, at the best, experimental, and apparently was intended to attract the patronage
of the public by holding out the name of the medicine as "Syrup
of Figs."
However that may be, it is now admitted that the use of
figs was found to be deleterious, and their use, as a substantial
or material ingredient,,ywas abandoned. The following extracts
are taken from the tefhtiony of the inventor of the medicine
now made and sold by the California Fig Syrup Company
"During the year-1878 Xtmade many experiments with the
idea of producing a pleasant, effective, liquid laxative, having
observed that many people dislike to take pills, oils and other
disagreeable medicines, and, after-many experiments and study
of laxatives in general, came to the conclusion that senna was
the best general laxative known, but that the preparations then
on the market were either weak in effect or griping in their nature, and.I thought thatif I could make a liquid preparation of
senna which would be really pleasant to the taste and free from
griping qualities that it would answer the purpose. And at that
time I also thought that certain other medicilial agents should
be combined with the senna, and some of those medicinal agents
were not very pleasant to the taste. And I thought of figs as
a fruit that would afford me a considerable quantity of sugar
and mucilaginous substance to counteract the unpleasant taste
of the medicinal agents. And I used figs freely in my experiments for that purpose. As I progressed with my experiments
I found or determined as a result of my experiments and studies that a uniformity and stability of product were of great im-

portance, and that the fig substance was not conducive to those
qualities, and that it had a strong tendency to ferment, and
therefore it would be better to use a small quantity I also
found that those medicinal agents which were unpleasant to
the taste were better adapted to special cases than to general
use, and concluded to omit them, and therefore did not need as
large a quantity of fig substance as formerly As finally prepared I had-a new and original compound, of which the fig
syrup formed a very small but pleasant part, although not an
essential part of the combination, that is, I might have used
an equal quantity of honey, or some other substance, instead of
the fig substance, without changing the character and effect of

would be new and original to distinguish my product from all
the laxative medicines, and which would be pleasantly suggestive, and, after thinking over a number of names, I decided
to use the name ' Syrup of Figs.' I knew that i was not using
the name generically, because figs did not -give character and
effect to the combination."
On cross examination this witness further stated that "we
still use figs when we might use some other pleasant substance,
because we 'first started to use figs, and the fig substance,
while it is used, is not an essential part of the compound or
what I would call an essential part of the compound. That is,
not a part of the compound which gives to it its distinctive aromatic and medicinal qualities."
That the complainant company, years after it had established a popular demand for its product, issued statements in
medical journals and newspapers and circulars, that the medical properties of their compound were derived from senna,
does not relieve it from the charge of deceit and misrepresentatinto the public. Such publications went only to giving information to wholesale dealers. The company by the use of
the terms of its so-called trade mark on its bottles, wrappers
and cartons continued to appeal to the consumers, out of
whose, credulity came the profits of their business. And, indeed, it was the imitation by the defendants of such false and
misleading representations that led to the present suit.

WORDEN v. CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP CO.
Opinion of the Court

The bill in the present case contains the following allegations-

"Your orator further states that this laxative medical compound, or preparation, made and put up as aforesaid by your
orator, has always been marked, named and called by your orator 'Syrup of Figs,' being advertised by your orator under
that name, the name 'Syrup of Figs' being printed or otherwise marked upon every bottle of this preparation made and
sold by your orator-this name being also printed upon the
boxes, packages or wrappers in which the bottles of this preparation are packed for shipment and sale, that it has been the
practice of your orator to put the bottles containing this preparation in oblong pasteboard boxes or cartons, so that they
will reach the consumer in that form, that in all instances,
not only the bottle which contains this preparation, but the
box or carton which contains the bottles of this preparation, is
marked with the words 'Syrup of Figs' and also contains
printed matter stating that this preparation is a medical laxative preparation, and also giving a general idea of its uses and
purposes.
Your orator further states that it and its
said predecessor in interest were the first to pack and dress or
mark a liquid laxative preparation or medicine in the manner
illustrated by Exhibits" A" and" B "-that is to say, in an oblong, rectangular box or carton, with statements of the virtues
of this preparation printed in different languages upon the
back and sides of the carton, and having on the front of the
carton and on the border within which, at the top, is a representation of a branch of a fig tree, bearing fruit and leaves,
surrounded by the words ' Fig Syrup Company,' or ' California
Fig Syrup Company,' and below which appear, in larger letters, the words ' Syrup of Figs.'"
Upon such allegations and the admissions of the complainant's principal witness, some of which are hereinbefore quoted,
and upon the entire evidence in the case, and in the light of
the authorities cited -by the counsel of the respective parties,
our conclusions are that the name "Syrup of Figs" does not,
