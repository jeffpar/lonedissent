interest. If the syndicate were successful in their litigation
with respect to, these lands, they would undoubtedly largely
increase in value; upon the other hand, if they were unsuccessful, the interest might be comparatively worthless. No
explanation is given for their delay, and none is suggested
except an apparent intention to wait and see what the value
of these lands was likely to become, and whether it would
prove more profitable to set aside the sale or let it stand.
While the delay in this case was not a long one, measured
simply by the time which elapsed after the sale was made, we
think, under the circumstances, it amounted to a ratification
of such sale, and that the bill should have been dismissed.

HORNER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL

FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT

No. 2.

OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 1473. Argued January 13, 14, 1892.-Decided March 7, 1892.

On a complaint before a United States commissioner in New York, against
H. for a criminal offence, in violation of ยง 3894 of the Revised Statutes,
as amended by the act of September 19, 1890; c. 908, (26 Stat. 465,) prohibiting the sending by mail of circulars concerning lotteries, H. was
committed to await the action of the grand jury. A -writ of habeas
corpus issued by the Circuit Court of the United States was dismissed by
that court. H. appealed to this court in November, 1891. Held,
(1) As the constitutionality of ยง 3894, as amended, was drawn in question, an appeal lay directly to this court from the Circuit Court,
under ยง 5 of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, (26 Stat. 826 to 828,
-

1115;)

HORNER v. UNITED STATES.

No. 2.

Opinion of the Court.

(2) Under such an appeal, this court acquires- jurisdiction of the entire
case, and of all questions involved in it, and not merely of the
question of constitutionality;
(3)

This court ought not to review the question whether the transaction
complained of was an offence against the statute, because the
commissioner had jurisdiction of the subject matter involved, and
of the person of H.;
(4) The statute is constitutional;
(5) A statute is a law equally with a treaty, and, if subsequent to and
conflicting with the treaty, supersedes the latter.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

MR.JusTICE BLA.TCHFOD delivered the opinion of the court.
On the 10th of August, 1891, a post-office inspector of the
United States made complaint on oath before John A. Shields,
a United States commissioner for the Southern District of
New York, that, on the 29th of December, 1890, Edward H.
Horner, of New York City, unlawfully deposited, and caused
to be deposited in the post-office at that city, in the State of
New York, and in the Southern District of New Yoik, a certain circular, to be conveyed and delivered by mail, which, in
the contents thereof, thereafter set forth in the complaint,
concerned a lottery, and which was then and there addressed
to Joseph Ehrman, 70 Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, and
was enclosed in an envelope, with postage thereon prepaid,
and carried by mail, and that the circular contained, among
other things, what is set forth in the margin, 1 the further contents of the complaint being"also set forth therewith.

probable cause to believe Horner guilty of the offende charged
in the warrant, and he committed Horner to the custody of
the marshal, in default of $5000 bail, to await the action.of
the grand jury. By consent,-Horner was then discharged,.on

resulting, according to the plan of redemption, will be paid to the bearer
by the universal state loan treasury.

"Each of the so-called bonds has upon its face a series number -and a
number in the series. The amount of indebtedness which said so-called
bond purports to evidence is one hundred (100) florins. The plan of drawing set forth on the back of said so-called bond shows that up to April,
1874, there were to take place five drawings a year, on dates therdin stated,
which should determine upon which of the so-called bonds payments should
be made and the amounts of such payments. That thereafter and until the
end of the nineteenth (19th) year after the date of the issue of the so-called
bonds, four drawings per year were to take place at stated dates for the
same purpose; and that thereafter, to and including the thirty-first (31st)
year, three (3) drawings were to take place at fixed dates for each year for
the same purpose; and that thereafter, to and including the fifty-fifth
(55th) year after the date of issue of such so-called bonds, two (2) drawings per year were to take place for the same purpose; at the end of which
time all of said so-called bonds wre, according to the plan aforesaid, to be
paid; that according to said plan the smallest amount to be paid for any of
such so-called bonds selected for payment during the first year after issue
was one hundred and thirty-five (135) gulden, during the second year one
hundred and forty (140) gulden, and during the third year one hundred and
forty-five (145) gulden, and so on, increasing in amount five (5) gulden each
year until the amount should reach two hundred (200) gulden, which amount
then remained fixed as the minimum sum to be paid for any of the so-called

default of $5000 bail, to the custody of .the marshal on the
warrant, to await the action of the grand jury. On the same
bonds whose payment should be determined by the drawings aforesaid;
that gulden and florins are denominations of money of the same value;
that under the said plan other larger amounts are provided to be paid on
certain of the so-called bonds, to be determined by the drawing. Thus,
during the first year the following sums are, according to said plan, to be
paid on certain so-called bonds, to be determined by such drawing, to wit:
one bond ......................................... 250,000 gulden
......... ................................ 25,000
.......................................... 15,000

,
7,500
"On 15 bonds, each at 500 gulden ........................
"
"On 30 bonds, each at 400 gulden ........................ 12,000
"On

"And during subsequent periods other provision is made for such larger
amounts.' That all of the said so-called bonds are in the same form as said
copy translation, and have the same drawing and redemption plan endorsed
upon them, and are identical in all respects, except that the series numbers
and the number thereof vary as to each so-called bond; that deponent produces herewith the original of the so-called bond herein referred to; that
all the drawings heretofore referred to by which, first, are determined the
series of the so-called bonds to be paid or.redeemed in each year, and,
second, are determined the particular bonds in the series whose holders
shall be entitled to the larger sums aforesid, the numbers of which are
drawn from the wheel, are conducted in such a way as that the determination of the numbers both for redemption and for amounts is wholly by lot
or chance. The holder of each so-called bond has an equal chance with the
holder of every other so-called bend, first, in securing an early payment of
his so-called bond, and, second, in securing, as a so-called payment for his
so-called bond, the very large prizes to which reference has already been
made, the result in each case, as before alleged, being dependent wholly on
lot or chance.
"Wherefore deponent says that the scheme for the so-called redemption
of the so-called bonds above referred to Is a lottery, and that the depQsiting of the said circular and the causing thereof to be deposited as above
alleged was against the peace and dignity of the United States of America,
and contrary to and in violation of section three thousand eight hundred
and ninety-four (3894) of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as
amended by the act of September nineteenth (19th), one thousand eight,
hundred and 'ninety (1890)."

Opinion of the Court.

day, on the petition of Horner, presented to the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Southern District of New York,
an order was made by that court that writs of habeas corpus
and certiora;
issue to the marshal and the commissioner,
returnable on that day. Returns were made to the writs, and
on the same day, after counsel were heard, the court, held by
Judge Wheeler,-.Inade an order dismissing the writ of habeas"
coipus and remanding Horner to the custody of the marshal.
Horner thereupon took an appeal to this court, on November
17, 1891, and was discharged on bail to abide the further
action of the"Circuit Court on the mandate of this court.
The complaint in this case is founded on ยง 3894 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended by the act of
September 19, 1890, c. 908, (26 Stat. 465,) which reads as follows: "No letter, postal card or circular concerning any lottery, so-called gift concert or other similar enterprise offering
prizes dependent upon lot or chance, or concerning schemes
devised for the purpose of obtaining money or property under
false pretences, and no list 'of the drawings at any lottery or
similar scheme, and no lottery ticket or part thereof, and no
check, draft, bill, money, posfal note or money order for the
purchase of any ticket, tickets, or part thereof, or of any share
or any chance in any such lottery or gift enterprise, shall be
carried in the mail or delivered at or through any post-office
or branch thereof, or by any letter carrier; nor shall any
newspaper, circular, pamphlet or publication of any kind containing any advertisement of any lottery or gift enterprise of
any kind offering prizes dependent upon lot or chance, or containing any list of prizes awarded at the drawings of any such
lottery or gift enterprise, whether said list is of any part or of
all of the drawing, be carried in the mail or delivered by any
postmaster or letter carrier. Any person who shall knowingly
deposit or cause to be deposited, or who, shall knowingly send
or cause to be sent, anything to be conveyed or delivered by
mail in violation.of this section, or who shall knowingly cause
to be delivered by mail anything herein forbidden to be carried by mail, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on
conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than five

Opinion of the Court.

hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one
year, or by both such fine and imprisonment for each offence.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section may
be proceeded against by information or indictment and tried
and.punished, either in the district at which the unlawful publication was mailed or to which it is carried by mail for delivery according to the direction thereon, or at which it. is caused
to be delivered by mail to the person to whom it is addressed."
There are 9 assignments of error in this case, 6 of which
allege that the facts proved before the commissioner do not
constitute a crime within ยง 3894, as amended; 2 of them are
based on the claim that that section is unconstitutional; and
the remaining one contends that that section is in violation of
a treaty between the United States and Austria, and is therefore void.
It is contended on the part of the United States that, as the
appeal in this case was taken on November 17, 1891, after the
act entitled "An act to establish circuit courts of appeals, and
to define and regulate in certain cases the jurisdiction of the
courts of the United States, and for other purposes," c. 517,
passed March 3, 1891, (26 Stat. 826,) went into effect, this
court has no jurisdiction of this appeal, and that it ought to
have been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. But, as the constitutionality of ยง 3894, as amended,
is drawn in question, an appeal in this case lies directly to this
court from the Circuit Court, under ยง 5 of the act of March 3,
1891, which gives such appeal "in Ary case in which the 'constitutionality of any law of the United States . .. is drawn
in question." This is in accordance with our decision in Nishimur.a _-kiu v. United States, 142 U. S. 651, 658, 659, where it
was said: "As this case involves the constitutionality of a law
of the 'United States, it is within the appellate jurisdiction of
this court, notwithstanding the appeal was taken since the act
establishing Circuit Courts of Appeals took effect. Act of
March 3, 1891, c. 517, ยง 5; 26 Stat. 827, 828, 1115."
We are further of opinion that where an appeal -or wriL
error is taken direct to this court under ยง 5 of the act of March
3, 1891, in a case in which the constitutionality of a law of the

HORNER v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

United States is drawn in question, this court acquires jurisdiction of the entire case, and of all questions involved in it, and
not merely of the question of the constitutionality of tlie law of
the United States. This is shown by the fact that, under see.
5, where an appeal or writ of error is taken direct to this court,
in a case in which the jurisdiction of the Distri6t Court or of
the Circuit Court is in issue, it is specifically directed that
"the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the
Supreme Court from the court below for decision," but there
is no kindred limitation prescribed in regard to any of the
other cases iii which jurisdiction in -this court of appeals or
writs of error is given by ยง 5.
It is contended for Horner that the circular set forth in the
complaint, relating to the redemption of the Austrian government bonds, is iot included in the prohibition of ยง 3894 of the
Revised Statutes, as amended, and that he committed no offence
by depositing such circular in the mail. 'But we are of opinion
that that question ought not to be reviewed by us on this
appeal. The point raised is that the Austrian bQnd scheme
was not a lottery. That is a question properly triable by the
court in which an indictment may be found against Horner.
He is now held to await the action of a grand jury. His case
is in the regular course of criminal adjudication. It is not
proper for this court, on this appeal, nor-was it proper for the
Circuit Court, on the writ of Aabeas corpus, to determine the
question as to whether the scheme was a lottery. Iln re Cortes,
136 U. S. 330; Stevens v. Fuller,136 U. S. 468. The commissioner had jurisdiction of the subject matter involved and of
the person of Horner, and the grand jury would have like
jurisdiction. The offence, if any, was committed within the
Southern District of New York. Whether the scheme was
lottery is a question to be determined in the administration of
the jurisdiction. It is not for this court to determine that
question in advance. The principle is the same as that involved in nrre Fassett,142 U. S. 479, 483, 484. The case presents for the determination of the court in which the indictment may be found tle question as to whether the scheme
was a lottery, and it is not for any court to determine it in

The question of the constitutionality of ยง 3894, as amended,
is disposed of by the decision of this court in Exparte Rapier,
