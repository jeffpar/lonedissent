delivered the opinion of the court.

The Uliited States has not appealed from the judgment
below, and, therefore, we need not coisider any question
raised by its counter-claim.

DUNWOODY v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

Does this case come within the principle announced in
United Stateg v. Langston, 118 U. S. 389, 391? Langston
was Minister Resident and Consul General of the United
States at the Republic of Hayti from September 28, 1877,
until July 2-, 1885, under a statute providing for a diplomatic
representative of the United States to the Republic of Hayti,
at an annual salary of $7500. That amount was annually
appropriated for the salary of that officer from the creation of
the office until 1883. But the Diplomati and Consular Appropriation acts for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1883,
1884 and 1885 appropriated only $5000 for the minister at
Hayti. And the question was whether Langston was entitled
to $7500 for each of the fiscal years last named. This court
said: "While the case is not free from difficulty, the court is
of opinion that, according to the settled rules of interpretation,
a statute fixing the annual salary of a public officer at a
named sum, without limitation as to time, should not be
deemed abrogated or suspended by subsequent enactments
which merely appropriated a less amount for the services of
that officer for particular fiscal years, and which contained no
words that expressly, or by clear implication, modified or
repealed the previous law."
We do not think the present case comes within the principle
of Langston's case. While the act of 1879, establishing the
National Board of Health, may be said to have created the
office of member of that board, with a fixed salary, and with-'
out express limitation as to time, the accompanying appropriation of a round sum to pay "the salaries and expenses" of
the board and to "carry out the purposes" of the act, indicates
that Congress intended that sum to be the limit of expenditure
for such objects, unless further appropriations were made. But
all doubt upon this subject is removed by subsequent legislation. The act of June 2, 1879, appropriating $500,000 to be
disbursed on estimates to be furnished by the board to the
Secretary of the Treasury, expired, by limitation, on the 2d of
Jane, 1883; and that of July 1, 1879, required all money
authorized by it to be expended, and all contrcts and liabilities incurred by the board to be paid out of the appropriation

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

of $500,000. The appropriation of $75,000 by the act of June
16, 1880, was for salaries and expenses of the board and to
*carry out the purposes of the various acts creating it. That
made by the act of Mlarch 3, 1881, for "salaries and expenses"
of the board, was accompanied by a direction that no more
money should be expended for the purposes of the various acts
creating it, out of any appropriations previously made, or by
virtue of any previous law; and the act of 1882 expressly
provided that "no other public money than that hereby
appropriated shall be expended for the purposes of the Board
of Health." These enactments evince the purpose upon the
part of Congress not to create any liability upon the part of
the United States, in respect to the work of the National
Board of Health, beyond the amounts specifically appropriated
by it from time to time for that work. This purpose, if not
clearly indicated by the act of 1879 establishing the board,
became manifest before the plaintiff rendered the services for
which, in this action, he claims compensation, as upon implied
contract. If the plaintiff is equitably entitled to be paid for
any of the servides in question rendered by him as a member
of the board, and if the special appropriation made for the
salaries and expenses of its officers and employ~s have been
exhausted, his appeal must be made to Congress. Looking at
all th6 acts of Congress passed before he became a member of
the board, it is clear that he did not perform services as such
member under any implied contract that he should be compensated otherwise than out of the moneys specially appropriated to meet the expenses incurred by the board in the
performance of the duties imposed upon it. In other words,
that board had no authority to incur any liability upon the
part of the government for salaries or other expenses in excess
of the amounts appropriated by Congress for such purposes.
These views dispose of the case adversely to the plaintiff,
as to his claim for compensation as a member of the board.
There is still less ground for a judgment in his favor in respect
to services rendered as chief clerk, disbursing agent and secretary. Congress never intended to incur liability for such
services beyond the sums appropriated from time to time for
the work of the board of health.
Judgment ffli rmed.
