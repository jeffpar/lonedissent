BARNEY v. LATHAM.

bly in assuming the function of a court for capital punishment
we are not prepared to say that such an utter perversion of their
powers to a criminal purpose would be screened from punishment by the constitutional provision for freedom of debate. In
this, as in other matters which have been pressed on our attention, we prefer to decide only what is necessary to the case in
hand, and we think the plea set up by those of the defendants
who were members of the House is a good defence, and the
judgment of the court overruling the demurrer to it and giving
judgment for those defendants will be affirmed. As to Thompson, the judgment will be reversed and the case remanded for
further proceedings.
So ordered.

BARNEY v. LATHAm.
1. The second clause of the second section of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137
(18 Stat., part .3, p. 470), construed, and hdd, that, when in any suit mentioned therein there is a controversy wholly between citizens of different
States, which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or
more of the plaintiffs or the defendants actually interested in such controversy may, on complying with the requirements of the statute, remove the
entire suit.
2. The right of removal depends upon the case disclosed by the pleadings when
the petition therefor is filed, and is not affected by the fact that a defendant
who is a citizen of the same State with one of the plaintiffs may be a
proper, but not an indispensable, party to such a controversy.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Minnesota.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. Thomas Wilson for the appellants.
Mr. Gordon E. Cole, eontra.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This case involves the construction of the second clause of
the second section of the act of March 8, 1875, c. 137 (18
Stat., part 3, p. 470), determining the jurisdiction of the circuit
courts of the United States, and regulating the removal ol
causes from the State courts.

BARNEY v. LATHAI.

[Sup. Ct.

It wvas commenced by a complaint filed in one of the courts
of the State of Minnesota. The plaintiffs are William H. Latham and Edward P. Latham, citizens, respectively, of Minnesota and Indiana. The defendants are Ashbel H. Barney,
Jessie Hoyt, Alfred M. Hoyt, Samuel N. Hoyt, William G.
Fargo, N. C. Barney, Charles T. Barney, citizens of New York;
A ngus Smith, a citizen of Wisconsin; Benjamin P. Cheney, a
citizen of Massachusetts; and the Winona and St. Peter Land
Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota.
The complaint is very lengthy in its statement of the grounds
upon which the suit proceeds, but the facts, so fax as it is necessary to state them, are these: The Territory and State of Minnesota received, under various
acts of Congress, lands to aid in the construction of railroads
within its limits. Act of March 3, 1857, c. 99, 11 Stat. 195;
Act of March 3, 1865, c. 105, 13 id. 526; Act of July 13, 1866,
183, 14 id. 97. The benefit of the grants from the government
was transferred by the State to the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company, a corporation created under its own laws, with
authority to construct a road from Winona westerly by way of
St. Peter in that State.
Prior to Oct. 31, 1867, the individual defendants already
named (except N. C. Barney and Charles T. Barney), together
with Charles F. Latham and Danforth N. Barney (both of
whom died before the commencement of this suit), had constructed one hundred and five miles of the proposed road for
that company, whereby it became entitled to several hundred
thousand acres of land, which it agreed, in consideration of its
indebtedness to those persons, to sell and convey to them, excepting so much thereof as was necessary for tracks, right of
way, depot grounds, and other purposes incidental to the operation of the road. Of the moneys advanced and used in construction Charles F. Latham contributed one thirty-seventh,
and to that extent, it is claimed, he was entitled, in equity, to
an undivided one thirty-seventh of the lands earned. The company, prior to October, 1870, received from the State conveyances of lands to the extent of 364,154 acres, which quantity
was increased to 617,510 acres by a deed from the State, of

Oct. 1880.]

BARNEY V. LATHAM.

date Feb. 26, 1872; and on May 30, 1874, it received a further conveyance for more than 500,000 acres. Up to the end
of the year 1869 the railroad company made numerous sales,
on long time, and in small quantities for actual settlement.
Charles F. Latham died in October, 1870, seised and possessed,
it is contended, of the equitable title to the undivided one
thirty-seventh of the lands earned. He left nine heirs-at-law,
atmong whom are the plaintiffs. The defendant, Ashbel H.
Barney, acting for his associates, had a settlement with those
heirs in reference to the sales of lands, and procured releases
from them, which are averred to have been fraudulent and
void as to the present plaintiffs. The facts averred in support
of that charge need not be here detailed. They are fully set
forth in the complaint. The surviving associates of Charles
F. Latham, together with N. C. Barney and Charles F. Barney, heirs-at-law of D. N. Barney, deceased, without the knowledge and consent of plaintiffs, incorporated themselves under
the general laws of the State of Minnesota, as the Winona and
St. Peter Land Company, to which, by their direction, the railroad company conveyed, and by which were thereafter man: ;4.d, all the lands remaining unsold. The plaintiffs claimed
that the individual defendants owed them, as heirs of Charles
F. Latham, the further sum of $3,500, on account of sales of
land made both prior to his death and subsequently thereto,
up to the time when the title to the lands was conveyed to the
lond company. The individual defendants repudiated the
claim of plaintiffs to any further sum on that account, and
the land company refused to recognize the claim of plaintiffs
to an interest in the unsold lands.
The specific relief asked for is, 1. That the individual defendants be required to account to
plaintiffs for the amount of all moneys which came to their
hands from the sales of land prior to the death of Charles F.
Latham, and pay over to plaintiffs the sum of $3,500, or such
other sum as shall be found, on an accounting, to be due them
as their share thereof; also such amounts as might be due
them out of the sums received by Ashbel H. Barney, from
purchasers subsequently to the death of Charles F. Latham;
". That the plaintiffs be adjudged to be the owners of two&

BARNEY v. LATHAM.

[Sup. Ct.

ninths of one thirty-seventh part of all unpaid contracts and
securities in the hands of the land commissioner of the company; that the land company be required to account with
plaintiffs for all lands sold by it subsequently to the conveyance from the railroad company, and convey to them an undivided two-ninths of one thirty-seventh of all the unsold lands.
The individual defendants answered and put in issue all the
material allegations of the complaint.
The land company, in its answer, admits the conveyance by
the railroad company to have been without any consideration
by it paid; that the stock therein is all held by its co-defendants and the heirs or personal representatives of D. N. Barney;
and that, if the relief prayed for against the other defendants
be granted, the company is liable to and should account to
plaintiffs as asked in their complaint. It consented that the
matters and facts established and proven as against its co-defendants may be considered as established and proven against
it, and such judgment accordingly entered as might he equitable and proper.
Upon the petition, accompanied by a proper bond, filed by
the individual defendants, the State court entered an order
that it would proceed no further in the suit. But upon motion
of plaintiffs the Circuit Court remanded the suit to the State
court, upon the ground that it was not removable under the
act of Congress.
Is this suit removable upon the petition of the individual
defendants, citizens of New York, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts ? Does the fact that the land company, one of the defendants, is a corporation of Minnesota, of which State one of
the plaintiffs is a citizen, prevent a removal of the suit to the
Circuit Court of the United States?
The answer to these questions depends upon the construction
which may be given to the second clause of the second section
of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137.
We will be aided in our construction of that act by recalling
as well the language as the settled interpretation of previous
enactments upon the subject of removal of causes from State
courts.
The act of Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20, gives the right of removal

Oct. 1880.]

BARNEY v. LATHAM.

to the defendant in any suit, instituted by a citizen of the State
in which the suit is brought against a citizen of another State.
According to the uniform decisions of this court it applied only
to cases in which all the plaintiffs were citizens of the State
in which the suit was brought, and all the defendants citizens
of other States. It made no distinction between a suit and the
different controversies which might arise therein between the
several parties; that is, Congress, when authorizing the removal
of the suit, did not permit any controversy therein between
particular parties to be carried into the Federal court, leaving
the remaining controversies in the State court for its determination. If the whole suit could not be removed, no part of it
could be taken from the State court.
Thus stood the law until the act of July 2T, 1866, c.288,
which (omitting such portions as have no bearing upon the
present question) provides that"If in any suit . . . in any State court . . . by a citizen of
the State in which the suit is brought against the citizen of another
State. ...a citizen of the State in which the suit is brought is or
shall be a detndant, and if the suit, so fhr as relates . . .to the

defendant who is a citizen of a State other than that in which the
suit is brought, is or has been instituted or prosecuted for the purpose of restraining or enjoining him, or if the suit'is one in which
there can be a final determination of the controversy, so far as it
concerns him. without the presence of the other defendants as parties in the cause, then and in every such case . . . the defendant

who is a citizen of a State other than that in which the suit is
brought, may, at any time betbre the trial or final hearing of the
cause, file a petition for the removal of the cause as against him
into the next Circuit Court of the United States, to be held in the
district where the suit is pending, and offer good and sufficient
surety for his enteing in such court . . . copies of said process
aZgainst him, and of all pleadings, depositions, testimony, and other
proceeilings in said cause affecting or concerning him, and also for
his there appearing; . . . and it shall be thereupon the duty of the

State court to accept the surety and proceed no further in the cause
as against the defendant so applying for its removal, . . . and the
said copies being entered as aforesaid in such court of the United
States the cause shall there proceed in the same manner as if it
had been brought there by original process against the defendant
VOL. XIIi.

BARNEY V. LATHAM.

[Sup. Ot.

who shall have so filed a petition for its removal as above provided. .. .And such removal of the cause, as against the defendant petitioning therefor, into the United States court shall not be
deemed to prejudice or take away the right of the plaintiff to proceed at the same time with the suit in the State court as against
the other defendants, if he shall desire to do so." 14 Stat. 306.
This provision is explicit, and leaves no room to doubt what
Congress intended to accomplish. It proceeds, plainly, upin
the ground, among others, that a suit may, under correct pleading, embrace several controversies, one of which may be between the plaintiff and that defendant who is a citizen of a
State other than that in which the suit is brought; that to the
final determination of such separate controversy the other defendants may not be indispensable parties; that in such a case,
although the citizen of another State, under the particular
mode of pleading adopted by the plaintiff, is made a co-defendant with one whose citizenship is the same as the plaintiff's, he
should not, as to his separable controversy, be required to remain in the State court, and surrender his constitutional right
to invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal court; but that, at his
election, at any time before the trial or final hearing, the cause,
so far as it concerns him, might be removed into the Federal
court, leaving the plaintiff, if he so desires, to proceed, in the
State court, against the other defendant or defendants. When
there were several defendants to that separable controversy, all
of whom are citizens of States other than that in which the
suit was brought, they could unite in claiming the removal of
such controversy.
Next came the act of March 2, 1867, c. 196, which allows
the citizen of the State other than that in which the suit was
brought, whether plaintiff or defendant, upon the proper affi
davit of prejudice or local influence, filed before the final hear
ing or trial of the suit, to remove the suit into the Federal court.
14 Stat. 558. It was construed in Case of the Sewing itachimnc
Companies (18 Wall. 553) as allowing a removal, upon such
an affidavit, only where there is a common citizenship upon
each side of the controversy raised by the suit; that is, all on
one side being citizens of the State in which the suit is brought,
while all on the other side are citizens of other States. IP

Oct. 1880.]

BARNEY v. LATHAM.

that case the plaintiff and one of the defendants were citizens
of the State where the suit was brought, while two of the defendants were citizens of other States. It was ruled that whatever was the purpose of the act of 1866 as to the particular
cawtcs therein provided for, Congress did not intend, by the act
of 1,67, to give to parties, who are citizens of States other
than that in which the suit is brought, the right of removal
upon the ground of prejudice or local influence, when their codefendants or co-plaintiffs, as the case might be, are citizens
of the same State with some of the adverse parties. The court
there evidently had in mind the case where the presence in
the suit of all the parties, on the side seeking the removal, was
essential in order that complete justice might be done, and not
a suit in which there was a separable controversy, removable
under the act of 1866.
We come now to the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, the second
section of which provides, "That any suit of a civil nature at law or in equity now pending
or hcreatter brought in any State court, where the matter in dispute
exceeds, exclnive of costs, the sum or value of $500. . . . in which
there is a controversy between citizens of different States, . . .
either party may remove said suit into the Circuit Court of the
United States for the proper district; and when, in any suit mentioned in this section, there shall be a controversy which is wholly
between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as,between them, then either one or more of the plaintiffs or
defendants, actually interested in such controversy, may remove
said suit to the Circuit Court of the United States for the proper
district." 18 Stat., pt. 3, p. 470.
We had occasion to consider the meaning of the first clause
of this section in Removal Cases, 100 U. S. 457. Disregardtng as immaterial the mere form of the pleadings, and placing
the parties on opposite sides of the real matter in dispute according to the facts, we found that the only controversy there
was between citizens of Ohio and Pennsylvania on one side,
and certain corporations created under the laws of Iowa on the
other. And we held that if, in arranging the parties upon the
respective sides of the real matter in dispute, all those on one
side are citizens of different States from those on the other, the

BARNEY V. LATHAM.

[Sup. Ct.

suit is removable under the first clause of the second section of
the act of 1875, those upon the side seeking a removal uniting in the petition therefor. Whether that suit was not also
removable under the second clause of that section we reserved
for consideration until it became necessary to construe that part
of the statute. The present case imposes that duty upon us.
We may remark that with the policy of the act of 1875 we
have nothing to do. Our duty is to give effect to the will of
the law-making power when expressed within the limits of the
Constitution.
We are of opinion that the intention of Congress, by the
clause under consideration, was not only to preserve some of
the substantial features or principles of the act of 1866, but to
make radical changes in the law regulating the removal of
causes from State courts. One difference between that act
and the second clause of the second section of the act of 1875
is, that whereas the former accorded the right of removal to the
defendants who were citizens of a State other than that one in
between them and the plainwhich the suit was brought, -if
tiff or plaintiffs there was, in the suit, a controversy finally
determinable as between them, without the presence of their
co-defendants, or any of them, citizens of the same State with
plaintiffs, - the latter gave such right to any one or more of
the plaintiffs or the defendants actually interested in such separate controversy. Both acts alike recognized the fact that a
suit might, consistently with the rules of pleading, embrace
several distinct controversies. But while the act of 1866, in
express terms, authorized the removal only of the separable
controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant or defendants seeking such removal, - leaving the remainder of the
suit, at the election of the plaintiff, in the State court, - the
act of 1875 provides, in that class of cases, for the removal of
the entire suit.
That such was the intention of Congress is a proposition
which seems too obvious to require enforcement by argument.
While the act of 1866 expressly confines the removal to that
part of the suit which specially relates to or concerns the de
fendant seeking the removal, there is nothing whatever in the
act of 1875 justifying the conclusion that Congress intended to

(jet. 18SO.]

BARNEY V. LATHAM.

leave any part of a suit in the State court where the right of re,
moral was given to, and was exercised by, an y_of the parties to
a separable controversy therein. Much confusion and embarrassment, Its well as increase in the cost of litigation, had been
found to result from the provision in the former act permitting
the separation of controversies arising in a suit, removing some
to the Federal court, and leaving others in the State court
for determination. It was often convenient to embrace in one
suit all the controversies which were so far connected by their
circumstances as to make all who sue, or are sued, proper,
though not indispensable parties. Rather than split up such a
swit between courts of different jurisdictions, Congress deter.
mined that the removal of the separable controversy to which
the judicial power of the United States was, by the Constit..
tion, expressly extended, should operate to transfer the whole
suit to the Federal court.
If the clause of the act of 1875, under consideration, is not
to be thus construed, it is difficult to perceive what purpose
there was in dropping those portions of the act of 1866 which,
0.'V-dld,t,,a, limited the removal, in the class of cases therein

provided for, to that controversy in the suit, which is distinctively between citizens of different States, and of which there
could be a final determination without the presence of the
other defendants as parties in the cause.
It remains only to inquire how far this construction of the

act of 1875 controls the decision of the case now before us.
The complaint, beyond question, discloses more than one controversy in the suit. There is a controversy between the plaintiffs and the Winona and St. Peter Land Company, to the fall
determination of which the other defendants are not, in any
legal sense, indispensable parties, although, as stockholders in
the company, they may have an interest in its ultimate disposition. Against the latter, as a corporation, a decree is asked
requiring it to convey to the plaintiffs the undivided two-ninths
.'f one thirty-seventh of certain lands, and to account for the
proceeds of the lands by it sold subsequently to the conveyance
from the railroad company.
But the suit as distinctly presents another and entirely sep.
arute controversy, as to the right of the plaintiffs to a decree

BARNEY v. LATHA.

[Sup. Ct.

against the individual defendants for such sum as shall be found,
upon an accounting, to be due from them upon sales prior to
the conveyance from the railroad company. With that controversy the land company, as a corporation, has no necessary
connection. It can be fully determined as between the parties
actually interested in it without the presence of that company
as a party in the cause. Had the present suit sought no other
relief than such a decree, it could not be pretended that the
corporation would have been a necessary or indispensable party
to that issue. Such a controversy does not cease to be one
wholly between the plaintiffs and those defendants because the
former, for their own convenience, choose to embody in their
complaint a distinct controversy between themselves and the
land company. When the petition for removal was presented,
there was in the suit, as framed by plaintiffs, a controversy
wholly between citizens of different States, that is, between the
plaintiffs, citizens respectively of Minnesota and Indiana, and
the individual defendants, citizens of New York, Wisconsin,
and Massachusetts. And since the presence of the land company is not essential to its full determination, the defendants,
citizens of New York, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts, were entitled, by the express words of the statute, to have the suit
removed to the Federal court.
It may be suggested that if the complaint has united causes
of action, which, under the settled rules of pleading, need not,
or should not, have been united in one suit, the removal ought
not to carry into the Federal court any controversy except that
which is wholly between citizens of different States, leaving for
the determination of the State court the controversy between
the plaintiffs and the land company. We have endeavored to
show that the land company was not an indispensable party to
the controversy between the plaintiffs and the defendants, citizens of New York, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts. Whether
those defendants and the land company were not proper parties
to the suit we do not now decide. We are not advised that
any such question was passed upon in the court below. It was
not discussed here, and we are not disposed to conclude its determination by the court of original jurisdiction, when it is
therein presented in proper form. A defendant may be a

Oct. 1880.]

BARNEY v. LATHAM.

proper, but not an indispensable, parity to the relief asked. In
a variety of cases it is in the discretion of the plaintiff as to
whom he will join as defendants. Consistently with established rules of pleading he may be governed often by considerations of mere convenience; and it may be that there was, or
is, such a connection between the various transactions set out
in the complaint as to make all of the defendants proper parties
to the suit, and to every controversy embraced by it, - at least,
in such a sense as to protect the complaint against a demurrer
upon the ground of multifariousness or misjoinder.
In Olier v. Piatt (3 How. 333, 411) we said: "It was well
oAbserved by Lord Cottenham, in Campbell v. Mackay, 1 Myl.
& Cr. 603, and the same doctrine was affirmed in this court
in Gaines and Wfe v. Jelf and Chew, 2 How. 619, 642, that it
ig impracticable to lay down any rule, as to what constitutes
multifariousness as an abstract proposition ; that each ease must
d-pend upon its own circumstances; and much must necessarily be left, where the authorities leave it, to the sound discretion of the court." We further said that the objection of
multifariousness cannot, "as a matter of right, be taken by the
parties, except by demurrer, or plea, or answer, and if not so
taken it is deemed to be waived ;" that although the court may
take the objection, it will not do so unless it deems such a
course necessary or proper to assist in the due administration
of justice. Story, Eq. Pl., sects. 530, 540; Shields v. Thomas,
18 How. 253; F;tch v. Creqhton, 24 id. 159. No objection
was taken by the defendants in the court below to the complaint upon the ground of multifariousness or misjoinder, and
the plaintiffs should not be heard to make it for the purpose,
or with the effect, of defeating the right of removal. They
are not in any position to say that that right does not exist, because they have made defendants those who were not proper
parties to the entire relief asked. The fault, if any, in pleading, was theirs. Under their mode of pleading, whether
adopted with or without a purpose to affect the right of removal, accorded by the statute, the suit presents two separate
controversies, one of which is wholly between individual citizens of different States, and can be fully determined without
the presence of the other party defendant. The right of

BARNEY v. LATHAM.

[Sup. Ct,

removal, if claimed, in the mode prescribed by the statute, depends upon the case disclosed by the pleadings as they stand
when the petition for removal is filed. The State court ought
not to disregard the petition, upon the ground that, in its opinion, the plaintiffs, against whom a removal is sought, had united
causes of action which should or might have been asserted in
separate suits. Those are matters more properly for the deteriination of the trial court, that is, the Federal court, after the
cause is there docketed. If that court should be of opinion
that the suit is obnoxious to the objection of multifariousness
or misjoi"tider, and for that reason should require the pleadings
to be reformed, both as to subject-matter and parties, according
to the rules and practice which obtain in the courts of the United
States, and if, when that is done, the cause does not really and
substantially involve a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of that court, it can, under the fifth section of the act
of 1875, dismiss the suit, or renuand it to the State court as justice requires.
We are of opinion that, upon the filing of the petition and
bond by the individual defendants in the separable controversy
between them and the plaintiffs, the entire suit, although all
the defendants may have been proper parties thereto, was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States, and that the
order remanding it to the State court whs erroneous.
The judgment is reversed with directions to the court below
to overrule the motion to remand, to reinstate the cause upon
its docket, and proceed therein in conformity with the principles of this opinion.
So ordered.
