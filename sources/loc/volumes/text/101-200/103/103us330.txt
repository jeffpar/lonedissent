ing. The claim is not that the attorney had no authority to
appear in the suit, but that his appearance was for a special
purpose only. This is clearly contradicted by the record. A
part of the issues originally made in the suit were then pending, and it was the duty of counsel to be in attendance on the
court to protect his client's interest until the whole subjectmatter of the litigation was finally disposed of.
The service by publication after the amendment was, under
the circumstances, unnecessary, and did not deprive the court
of the jurisdiction which it had acquired before.
Judgment affirmed.

BouLDLN v. ALEXANDER.
1. Pending a suit brought to control the affairs of a church and obtain posses
sion of its property by a portion of the congregation against its founder
and another portion, each claiming to be the lawfully elected trustees,
every member who desired to worship at the church was permitted to do
so, and it was kept exclusively for church purposes. A decree passed
for the complainants. Held, that they were not entitled to recover for
the use and occupation of the church premises, as no claim therefor was
made in their bill, and the defendants derived no pecuniary advantage
therefrom.
2. The referee having found that money had been collected on behalf of the
church by the pastor, who held a deed of trust on the church property to
secure notes payable to him, this court directs that he be allowed by the
court below to produce them ik order that the money be applied as a credit
thereon, or, upon his failure to 'to so, or to satisfactorily account for them,
that a decree be entered against him for the money.

others against Albert Bouldin and others, to determine which of
two contending boards of trustees of the "Third Colored Baptist Church" was entitled to the possession and control of the
church property, including the church building erected by the
association as a place of worship; to correct a mistake in a
deed executed by Bouldin to the trustees of the church, and to
obtain a settlement with him of his accounts as the agent and
pastor of the church, and the cancellation and discharge of certain notes secured by real or pretended deeds of trust which
had been, from time to time, executed to him. The first and
second of these things were accomplished by a decree affirmed
in this court at the December Term, 1872, and reported in 15
Wall. 131. The complainants were, by that decree, adjudged
to be the lawful trustees; the mistake in the deed was corrected,
and the present appellants, defendants below, were ordered to
deliver the possession of the church building and the lot on
which it stood to the complainants. This left nothing to be
disposed of but the matters of account between Bouldin and
the church, and the notes which had been given to him. With
a view to this end, the original decree, affirmed here on the former appeal, was that the cause be referred to the auditor of the
court below "to examine and report the facts on the following
questions: "1st, Whether the defendant, Albert Bouldin, purchased,
under the direction of the church, the entire lot of ground on
the corner of Fourth and L Streets of George H. Varnell, for
the use and benefit of said church; and whether the money collected by said Bouldin from or on behalf of the church was by
him used to aid in the payment of said lot, and, if so, to what
amount.
"2d, To state the accounts between the said Albert Bouldin
and the plaintiffs, as trustees of the said church, and the trustees
of whom they are the successors; to report the amounts of
money received by said Bouldin from the said church, and from
other persons on behalf of said church, and the amounts to
which he was entitled for his services in behalf of said church,
and has expended therein and about thb same, and to state the
balance due either way, and for these purposes that he may call
witnesses und take testimony.

BOULDIN V. ALEXANDER.

[Sup. or.

"That the plaintiffs, until the futher order of this court, are
enjoined and restrained from selling, disposing of, or in any way
incumbering the title of said church property so as to weaken
the security of said Bouldin upon the church property."
When our mandate went down on that appeal, the complainants moved that a writ of possession issue at once; but the court
withheld it for the coming in of the auditor's report, and, with
the consent of the defendants, the order of reference was made
to include the following additional questions: "3. In whose possession has the church building and property
on the corner of Fourth and L Streets, Washington, D. C., been
since the commencement of this suit?
"4. What is the fair value of the rents, issues, and profits
arising and accruing to the party in possession of said property
from and since this suit?"
There was no claim in the bill for compensation for the use
and occupation of the property, though it was alleged that the
defendants unlawfully and by force kept the complainants, who
were the only duly elected trustees, out of possession.
As to the notes, it was alleged in the bill that on the 28th of
July, 1862, six notes were made to Bouldin, five for the sum of
$100 each, payable in one, two, three, four, and five years from
date, and the other for $120, payable in six years; and that these
notes were secured by a deed of trust to one J. W. Barnaclo.
In addition to this, according to the averments in the bill, four
other notes of $400 each were afterwards executed to Bouldin,
on a settlement of his accounts for the erection of the church
building. It was also alleged that the defendants who claim to
be trustees of the church property had executed a deed of trust
to one Callan, to secure all the notes originally given to Bouldin.
The claim on the part of the complainants was, that on a full
settlement of all the accounts of Bouldin, and , correction of
the mistakes that had occurred in former settlements, it would
be found there was nothing due on the notes, and that Bouldin
would be largely in debt to the church.
The defendants, in their answer, claimed that the notes for
$620 were given and secured by deed of trust to Barnaclo, as
stated in the bill, and that on the settlement of accounts, when
the church building was completed, six notes, of 0400 each,

were given to Bouldin, instead of four. The execution of the
deed of trust by the defendant trustees was also relied on.
On the hearing of the case before the auditor, Bouldin refused to produce the notes that had been given to him, or account for their absence. It was proved, however, that there
had been paid to or collected by him divers sums of money
which should be credited on the notes. The aggregate of these
sums, including interest from the date of payment to Nov. 1,
1875, is, according to the report of the auditor, $1,233.47. On
account of the failure of Bouldin to present the notes, the auditor made no statement of the amount due upon them, but
treated them as withdrawn from the suit by Bouldin. The auditor also found that the entire lot of ground on the corner of
Fourth and L Streets, bought from Varnell, was for the use of
the church, and charged Bouldin with the proceeds of a sale
made of part of the lot. He also reported that the defendants
had been in the possession of the church property since the
commencement of the suit, and that the value of the rents,
issues, and profits accruing to them by reason of such possession, was six per cent per annum on the value of the property,
or 8498.33 a year. He, therefore, in his accounting, charged
the defendants with that amount, payable quarterly each year,
from Sept. 28, 1867, the date of the commencement of the suit,
until Oct. 1, 1875, and interest on each quarterly instalment
as it fell due. The total amount of his allowances in this way,
on account of rents, was $4,910.26, as of Oct. 1, 1875.
Upon the filing of the report, the complainants excepted because rents had not been charged from July 28, 1867, instead
of September 28. The defendants excepted, 1, because they
had been charged with mesne profits; 2, because Bouldin was
not credited for the amount of his notes; 3, because Bouldin
was ,-harged for the proceeds of the part of the lot bought from
Varnell which he had sold; 4, because no allowance had been
made to Bouldin for his services; and, 5, because of the amount
allowed for payments made to Bouldin.
The court below at special term overruled the exceptions of
the complainants, and sustained the exceptions of the defendants to the allowance against Bouldin for the proceeds of the
sale of part of the lot bought from Varnell. and to the allow-

ance against all the defendants for rents, and returned the case
to the auditor for a further stating of the accounts in accordance with certain instructions. From this decree at special
term an appeal was taken by the complainants to the general
term, where a decree was rendered against all the defendants.
the present appellants, for $4,734.12, "as mesne profits for use
and occupation by them of the church premises during the pendency of this suit, to wit, from the commencement of the suit
until March 31, 187T, when the said premises were returned to
the possession of the plaintiffs." The decree then further goes
ol to say, "The promissory notes given by the plaintiffs as trustees of the church to the defendant, Albert Bouldin, are not
included in this decree, the same having been withdrawn from
the consideration of the court. But all other claims by him
made against the church or its trustees are rejected and disallowed. The item of interest on mesne profits reported by the
auditor in favor of the complainants is disallowed." It was also
ordered that the injunction restraining J. W. Barnaclo from
proceeding under the deed of trust to him, and that restraining
the complainants from selling, disposing, or incumbering the
title to the church property, be dissolved.
From this decree the defendants below have alone appealed,
and they assign for error the decree against them for the payment of mesne profits, and the disallowance of the claims of
Bouldin, not embraced in his notes.
As to the mesne profits, we think the decree below cannot be
sustained. There is no claim for an allowance of this kind in
the bill, and the proofs do not show that the appellants, or those
whom they represent, derived individually any such pecuniary
advantage from the use of the property pending the suit as to
make it proper they should be held personally accountable in
that way. Bouldin was the founder of the society. He gathered
the congregation together. He bought the church lot and superintended the erection of the church building. If money was
wanted that could not be got from others, he furnished it himself from his own means, and in the end, as the case shows,
while the society had secured a property worth, according to
the report of the auditor, a little more than $8,000, there
was a debt owina to him of over $3,000. The congregation had

increased under his administration to several hundred members. Afterwards dissensions grew up, and two parties were
formed, the complainants representing one and the defendants
the other. Each sought to control the property and govern the
society. The defendants kept possession, and apparently a part
of the time with the approbation of the court, for a writ to put
them out was denied when applied for. At last the complainants were successful, and Bouldin and his party were required
to submit to their government. The contest all along was not
so much for possession of the property as for the control of the
church affairs. During the entire controversy the church property has been kept exclusively for church purposes. Every
member of the congregation was permitted to worship there
if he chose. It is possible that the parties officiating at the
religious services and controlling the- property may not at all
times have been such as the complainants and their adherents
wanted, but no person was excluded from the church building
for the purposes of worship if he wanted to go in. Under
these circumstances it seems to us that the defendants are not
in equity chargeable personally with the value of the use and
occupation of the property during the time they were litigating
to keep the control of the society and its affairs.
In other respects the decree below is right, so far as it goes.
Upon the evidence, Bouldin is not entitled to any further credits than have been allowed. He voluntarily withdrew or withheld his notes from the auditor and the court, and cannot have
any affirmative relief on their account. His rights under the
Barnaclo deed of trust are saved by the decree, and as the persons who executed the Callan deed were not lawful trustees,
all proceedings under that deed were properly enjoined. We
think, however, some order should have been made giving the
complainants the benefit of the finding in their favor by the
auditor in respect to the moneys paid to or collected by Bouldin
to apply on his notes. From the answer of Bouldin, it seems
probable that a part of these payments have already been indorsed on the notes; but this cannot be determined with certainty without an inspection of the notes themselves. If he
will produce the notes, or satisfactorily account for their absence, so that the proper application of all payments can be

[Sup. Ct.

made under the direction of the court and the notes discharged
to the extent of the application, that should be done. But if,
on an order to that effect, he shall fail to produce the notes, or
fail satisfactorily to account for their absence, a decree should
be entered against him personally for the several amounts reported by the auditor as having been paid to or collected by
him on that account. As this last proceeding has been rendered necessary by his failure to produce the notes on the former hearing, he should be charged with the costs consequent
upon such refusal.
The decree will be reversed so far as it charges the appellants
with any sum for mesne profits and use and occupation, and the
cause remanded for such further proceedings in conformity with
this opinion as may appear to be necessary; and it is
So ordered.
