1. The act of the General Assembly of Missouri, approved March 18, 1871,
which provides that "it shall be lawful for the council of any city, or the
trustees of any incorporated town, to purchase lands, and to donate, lease.
or sell the same to any railroad company upon such terms and conditions
as such board may deem proper, and for the purposes of assisting and
inducing such railroad company to locate and build machine shops or other
improvements upon such lands, and, for such purposes, to levy taxes upon
the taxable property of such city or town, and to borrow money and to
issue the bonds of such city or town for such purposes: Providcd, a majority of the qualified voters of such town or city, at a special election to be
held therein, shall assent to such purchase and donation," is void, it being
in conflict with sect. 14 of art. 11 of the Constitution adopted in 1865, which
declares that "the General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city,
or town to become a stockholder in, or to loan its credit to, any company,
association, or corporation, unless two-thirds of the qualified voters of such
county, city, or town, at a regular or special election to be held therein,
shall assent thereto." .
2 The provision which prohibits the creation of an indebtedness by a direct
loan of municipal credit does not permit the indirect use of such credit for
the same purpose.
& The act of Feb. 16,1872, forbidding, under certain penalties therein prescribed,
the officers of a municipality in its behalf to loan the credit thereof, or
donate to or subscribe stock in any railroad or other company, without
the previous assent of two-thirds of the qualified voters, is merely prohibitory in its character, and confers no authority on those officers when such
assent was given.
C Hdd, therefore, that the bonds of the "municipal corporation of the inhabitants of the town of Moberly," in the county of Randolph, in the State of
Missouri, dated May 1, 1872, and reciting that they are "issued in pursuance of an election held in said town on the twenty-sixth day of March,
A. D. 1872, to decide whether said town should purchase and donate to the
St. Louis, Kansas City, and Northern Railway Company two hundred acres
of land for machine-shop purposes, the result of said election being two
hundred and twenty-eight votes for the purchase and donation and one
vote against the purchase and donation; and, in pursuance to orders of
the board of trustees of the inhabitants of the town of Moberly, made on
the eighteenth day of April, A. D. 1872, which orders were made in accordance with an act of the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, entitled
'An Act to authorize cities and towns to purchase lands, and to donate,
lease, or sell the same to railroad companies,' approved March 18, A. D.
1870," are void.

statute, have certified, for the decision of this court, the following points upon which they differed, namely: First, Whether the act of March 18, 1870, entitled "An Act
to authorize cities and towns to purchase lands, and donate,
lease, or sell the same to railroad companies," recited in the
bonds, is in conflict with sect. 14 of art. 11 of the Constitution
of Missouri.
Secont, Whether the petition states a valid and sufficient
cause of action.
The act of March 18, 1870, under which the bonds were
issued, declares that "it shall be lawful for the council of any
city, or the trustees of any incorporated town, to purchase
lands, and to donate, lease, or sell the same to any railroad company, upon such terms and conditions as such board may deem
proper, and for the purposes of assisting and inducing such railroad company to locate and build machine-shops or other improvements upon such lands; and for such purposes to levy
taxes upon the taxable property of such city or town, and to
borrow money and to issue the bonds of such city or town for
such purposes: P'rovided,a majority of the qualified voters of
such town or city, at a special election to be held therein, shall
assent to such purchase and donation."
Sect. 14 of art. 11 of the Constitution of Missouri of 1865,
with which it was contended the act conflicted, declares that
" the General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city,
or town to become a stockholder in, or to loan its credit
to, any company, association, or corporation, unless two-thirds
of the qualified voters of such county, city, or town, at a

To meet the objections to the alleged invalidity of the bonds,
the plaintiff cited the act of the legislature of Feb. 16, 1872,
entitled "An Act to protect counties, cities, and incorporated
towns from combinations between railroad companies, county
courts, city councils of cities, and boards of trustees of incorporated towns," the first section of which declares that "no
county court of any county, city council of any city, nor any
board of trustees of any incorporated town, shall hereafter have
the right to douate, take, or subscribe stock for such county,

railroad company, or other company, corporation, or association
unless authorized to do so by a vote of two-thirds of the qualified voters of such county, city, or incorporated town. And
any justice of a county court, member of a city council, or
member of a board of trustees of any incorporated town, who

association, unless authorized to do so by a vote of two-thirds
of the qualified voters of such county, city, or incorporated
town, shall be adjudged guilty of a felony, and on conviction
thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary
for not less than two years."
Other sections repeal all acts or parts of acts inconsistent
with it. The act took effect on its passage. On the 29th of
March, 1872, the legislature passed another act, in terms
amending the first section of the act of March 18, 1870, so as
to read as follows "It shall be lawful for the council of any city, or the trustees of
any incorporated town, to purchase land, and to donate, lease, or
sell the same to any railroad company, and to contract, for a period
of time not exceeding twenty years, with such railroad company,
for the payment of all or any part of the taxes which may at any
time be levied by the authorities of such town or city, and for such
town or city purposes only, upon property of such railroad company, and upon such terms and conditions as such board of said
city or town may deem proper, for the purpose of assisting and inducing said railroad company to locate and build machine, work,
or other shops, or other improvements, upon such land for the purpose of such purchase, to levy taxes upon the taxable property
of such city or town, and to borrow money and issue the bonds of
such city or town for such purpose: Provided,that two-thirds
of the qualified voters of such town or city, at a regular or special
election to be held therein, shall assent to such purchase or donation."
This act took effect on its passage.

JARROLT v. M BERLY.

MR. JUSTICE FiELD, after stating the case, delivered th6
3pinion of the court.

The object of the inhibition in the State Constitution was to
prevent the creation of debts by counties, cities, and towns on
behalf of any company, association, or corporation without the
assent of two-thirds of their qualified voters. The loan of their
credit, that is, the placing of their obligations for the payment
of money for the use of companies, was the usual mode in
which they incurred indebtedness. Aid in this way to companies, particularly such as were organized for the construction
of railroads, was given so frequently by municipal bodies in
Missouri, before the Constitution of 1865 went into effect, as
in many instances to greatly embarrass and subject them to
burdensome and oppressive taxation to provide for the interest
on their obligations and the ultimate payment of the principal.
Numerous acts of the legislature had authorized officers of
counties and cities to subscribe for stock in railway companies,
and to issue bonds for their aid without limit as to amount and
without the previous assent of those who were to be taxed for
their payment. In many instances the road, in aid of which
the bonds were issued, was never constructed, and as no benefit
resulted to the counties and cities, their inhabitants naturally
felt impatient under the burdens which their officers had improvidently imposed.
It was the purpose of the constitutional provision to check
these abuses, by requiring the previous assent of two-thirds of
the qualified voters of the municipal bodies before any more
stock should be subscribed by them or any further indebteduiess be thus incurred. The issue of obligations directly to the
company, association, or corporation, without such previous
assent, is within the letter of the prohibition, and to purchase
property to be given to such company, association, or corporation by the issue of obligations to others, without such assent, is
within its spirit. Both modes of using the bonds of the municipality are equally a use of its credit, the difference being that
the one is a direct and the other an indirect way of employing
the credit of the municipality for the benefit of the railway
company. It would be a narrow and strict construction of the
constitutional provision to hold that it prohibited the creation

b86

JARROLT V. MOBERLY.

[Sup. Ct.

of indebtedness by a municipality by a direct use of its credit
for the railway company, and yet permitted such creation by the
indirect use of it for the same purpose. A constitutional provision should not be construed so as to defeat its evident purpose, but rather so as to give it effective operation and suppress
the mischief at which it was aimed. In accordance with this
principle, this court held in Harshman v. Bates County that
the inhibition in question extended to townships in Missouri
as well as to counties, cities, and towns, although townships
were not mentioned. To contend, said the court, that the mere
subdivision of counties into townships enabled the legislature
to evade the constitutional provision is to ignore the manifest
intention and spirit of that instrument; that it could not be
possible that it was intended to restrict the legislature as to
counties and not to restrict it as to mere sectional portions of
the counties. 92 U. S. 569.
Considering the provision in this spirit, and looking at the
evil to be prevented, we are of opinion that the issue by the
defendant of its bonds to purchase lands, to be donated to
the railway here, was a loan of its credit which could not be
made without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified voters
of the city. It is true that a loan implies a return of the thing
loaned at some future day. A loan of credit would, therefore,
seem to require that the party receiving its benefit should provide for its cancellation by the payment of the bonds issued.
This being so, it would be unreasonable to hold that, whilst
the framers of the Constitution intended to prohibit a temporary use of the credit of a municipality without the previous
assent of two-thirds of its qualified voters, they were willing
that the absolute grant of the credit should be made without
such assent. We do not think that a construction leading to
such a conclusion is permissible. The act of March 18, 1870,
must, therefore, be held to be in conflict with the Constitution
of the State. It authorizes a majority of the voters of a municipality to do that which the Constitution declares the legislature shall not authorize to be done except by the assent of
two-thirds of such voters.
The Supreme Court of Missouri has given a similar construction to the constitutional provision. An act of the legislature

Oct. 1880.]

JARROLT V. MOBERLY.

had, among other things, provided for the establishment of a
school of mines and metallurgy as a branch of the university of
the State, which was to be located in such county having mines
as should donate to the board of curators of the university, for
buildings and other purposes of the school, the greatest available amount of money and bonds. The act authorized the
county court, of a county desirous of making a donation, to
i.sue bonds of the latter to be delivered to the board of curators
: nd to be by them sold, and the proceeds used in the purchase
of the land and the erection of the necessary buildings. Under
this act, the County Court of Phelps County ordered the issue
of bonds, at different times, amounting in all to $75,000, to be
used as mentioned, and their delivery to the curators. The
order was made without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county, and, upon the petition of the State,
the sale of the bonds was enjoined, the court holding that their
issue was a loan of credit within the constitutional inhibition,
and that the act authorizing their issue, without the sanction
of two-thirds of the voters of the county, was void. It stated
that the object of the inhibition upon county courts and city
and town municipalities was to prevent them from taxing the
people without their assent. 57 Mo. 178.
The difference between that case and the one at bar is only
in the mode of effecting the same result. There the bonds
were given to the curators to be by them sold and the pro
ceeds invested in the establishment of the school of mines.
Here the bonds were to be sold by the municipality issuing
them, and the proceeds used by it in the purchase of lands to
be donated to the railroad company. The object of the loan
in both cases, in authorizing the issue of the bonds, was the
purchase of property and the donation of it to corporations.
As remarked by counsel, it is difficult to see how the fundamental law of the State could be evaded by a change of the
parties through whom the credit of the municipality is to be
converted into money. In either case the debt created is to
be paid by taxation.
The subsequent case of the County Court of St Louis County
against Griswold does not change this decision. The bonds
there considered were issued to purchase lands in St. Louis foi

a public park for the benefit of its inhabitants. There was
no loan of credit for the use of any other parties in the case.
58 id. 175.
The act of the legislature of Feb. 16, 1872, upon which
much reliance is placed by counsel for the plaintiff, is merely
prohibitory in its character, forbidding the officers of counties,
cities, and towns to donate, take, or subscribe stock in any railroad or other comhpany, corporation, or association, or the loan
of their credit, without the previous assent of two-thirds of their
qualified voters, and prescribing a punishment for a disregard
of its provisions. It confers, of itself, no authority. The inhibition upon the officers of a county, city, or town to loan its
credit without the previous assent of others, was not an authority to loan it when such assent was given. Authority to create
an indebtedness against a municipality, except on certain conditions, was not conferred, because the attempt thus to create
it was made punishable as a crime. Further legislation was
needed. Such was the evident opinion of the legislature of the
State, for, by an additional act, passed on the 29th of March,
1872, the authority was given in terms.
We answer, therefore, the first question certified to us in the
affirmative, and the second in the negative.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissenting.

The recitals in the bonds show that an election was held, in
the town of Moberly, three days before the passage of the act
of March 29, 1872, to decide whether that town should purchase and donate to the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Northern
Railway Company, two hundred acres of land for machineshop purposes; that two hundred and twenty-eight votes were
cast in favor of, and only one against, such donation and purchase; that the bonds in question were issued in pursuance of
that election and of the orders of the board of trustees of the
town, made on the eighteenth day of April, 1872; and that
such orders were made in accordance with the aforesaid act of
March 18, 1870.
The circuit judge conceded it to be the settled law of Missouri that municipal aid could be given to railroad companies

without infringing the Constitution of the State ; and that if
machine-shops constituted an integral or essential part of a rail
road, or were necessary for its convenient use or operation, then
the act of March 18, 1870, was not obnoxious to the principles
announced in Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655. But
he was of opinion that the issuing of the bonds in suit to be
used in the purchase and donation of lands to a railroad company for machine-shop purposes was a "loan of credit," upon
the part of the town, within the meaning of the State Constitution; and that, consequently, the act of March 18, 1870, was
unconstitutional, in that it permitted an issue of bonds, for
such purposes, upon the assent only of a majority of the qualified voters of the municipality.
In the view which I take of this case, it is not necessary to
decide whether this transaction was, or not, a loan of credit.
For, assuming that it was, the petition must be regarded as
stating a valid and sufficient cause of action against the defendant, if, at the time of the election, held on the 26th of March,
1870, the act of March 17, 1870, had become so modified by
subsequent legislation, as to require the assent of two-thirds
of the qualified voters of the town as a condition precedent to
any issue of bonds to be applied in the purchase of lands to be
donated to the railroad company for machine-shop purposes.
And such, I think, was the legal effect of the act of Feb. 16,
1872. The first clause of its first section declares, that "no
county court of any county, city council of any city, nor any
board of trustees of any incorporated town, shall hereafter have
the right to donate, take, or subscribe stock for such county,
city, or incorporated town, in, or loan the credit thereof to, any
railroad company . . .unless authorized to do so by a vote of
two-thirds of the qualified voters of such county, city, or incorporated town." The General Assembly, of course, knew when
they passed the law of Feb. 16, 1872, that the previous statute
of March 18, 1870, had assumed to authorize counties, cities,
and towns to make donations to railroad companies, for machine-shop purposes, upon a bare majority vote of the qualified
electors. The prohibition against donations thereafter, except
with the sanction of two-thirds of the qualified voters, was, in
view of former legislation, equivalent to an affirmative recogni-

JARROLT V. MOBERLY.

[Sul). Oh.

tion of power thereafter to make such donations in pursuance
of the provisions of the act of Feb. 16, 1872. That act imported into the act of March 18, 1870, the requirement of a
two-thirds affirmative vote as a condition precedent to any
donation of land for machine-shop purposes. The express repeal, by the act of Feb. 16, 1872, of all parts of laws inconsistent therewith, evinces a purpose, upon the part of the General
Assembly, to do something more than declare a violation of that
act, by any of the officers therein named, to be a felony. Nor
was it intended to withdraw from counties, cities, and towns
authority, under any circumstances, to make such donations.
Manifestly thele was also a purpose to provide against the
possibility of donations or loans of credit, under any existing
statute, except with the express sanction of two-thirds of the
qualified voters of the municipality. The only difficulty in
the way of this conclusion arises from the negative character
of the language of the first clause of the act of Feb. 16, 1872.
But that difficulty seems to be removed by the fact that a previous statute having assumed to confer upon counties, cities,
and towns the power to make donations to railroad companies
for machine-shop purposes, the object of the act of Feb. 16,
1872, was thereafter to require the previous assent of two-thirds
of the electors, and to repeal all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with that requirement. The bonds, upon their face, show
the assent of all the electors voting except one. Had these
bonds recited, in terms, that they were issued in pursuance of
the act of March 18, 1870, as modified by subsequent legislation,
there would have been no ground upon which to question the
authority to issue them.
But the rights of the purchaser of the bonds should not be
sacrificed because the reference to the statute, by authority of
which they were issued, was not full or technically accurate.
When the election was held, the statute of March 18, 1870, as
modified by that of Feb. 16, 1872, authorized an issue of bonds
for the purchase of lands to be donated for machine-shop purposes, two-thirds of the qualified voters of the town assenting
thereto. The provisions of that statute, as thus modified, seem
to have been complied with.
I am of opinion that the act of March 29, 1872, passed after

Oct. 1880.J

ADABM

v. NORRIS.

the election of March 26, 1870, was only cumulative legislation,
so far as it related to subjects embraced in the act of March
17, 1870, as modified by the act of Feb. 16, 1872. I think that
the act of March 17, 1870, as modified by the act of Feb. 16,
1872, was constitutional, and that the petition states a good
cause of action against the defendant, even if the issue, by the
town, of bonds for the purposes indicated, was a loan of credit,
within the meaning of the State Constitution.
For these reasons I feel obliged to dissent from the opinion
and judgment.

thereto, and is evidence that, as against the United States, the validity

3. A patent issued upon a survey of a grant was returned by the grantee to
the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, who ordered another survey.
