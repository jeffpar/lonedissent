1. The common-law rule is in force in Michigan, that the resignation of a
public officer is not complete until the proper authority accepts it, or does
something tantamount thereto, such as to appoint a successor.
2. After making a return to the alternative mandamus sued out against him by
a judgment creditor of a township, the township supervisor cannot set up
the non-service of any notice in the cause.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Western District of Michigan.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

for the plaintiff in error.
M1,. Johnt W. Stonle and Mr. i31. J. Smoiley, contra.
MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

William F. Thompson, on the fifth day of September, 1874,
recovered a judgment in the court below against the township
of St. Joseph, in the county of Berrien, Michigan, for the sum
of $17,327.86 besides costs.
By the laws of Michigan an execution cannot be issued
against a township upon a judgment, but it is to be "levied and
collcted as other township charges;" and when collected to
"be paid by the township treasurer to the person to whom the
awe ,hall have been adjudged." Comp. Laws of 1871, sect.
h;: . The mode of raising money by taxation in townships
is prescribed in sects. 992 and 997, which make it the duty of
the township clerk, on or before the first day of October of each
year, to make and deliver to the supervisor of the township a
certified copy of all statements on file, or of record, in his office,
of moneys proposed to be raised therein by taxation for all purposes; and it is made the duty of the supervisor, on or before
the second Monday of said month, to deliver such statements
to the clerk of the board of supervisors of the county, to be
laid by him before the board at its annual meeting. At this
meeting the board is required to direct the several amounts
to be raised by any township, which appear by the certified
statements to be authorized by law, to be spread upon the
assessment roll of the proper township, together with its due

EDWARDS V. UNITED STATES.

(Sup. Ct.

proportion of the county and State taxes. The whole is then
certified and delivered by the clerk of the board to the town
supervisor whose duty it is to make the individual assessment
to the various taxpayers of the township in proportion to the
estimate and valuation of their property. The assessment roll
is then delivered to the town treasurer for collection.
The judgment in the present case not being paid, and the
township officers having refused to take any steps to levy the
requisite tax for the purpose, the United States, on the relation
of Thompson, on the 11th of October, 1876, filed a petition
for a mandamus against Edward Ml. Edwards, supervisor of the
township of St. Joseph, in which he set forth the judgment,
and alleged that, on the 26th of September, 1876, he caused a
certified transcript of the judgment to be served on the township clerk, with proper notice and demand; and on the 27th of
September, 1876, he caused a similar transcript, notice, and
demand to be served on Edwards, the supervisor. The petition further alleged that these officers refused to do anything
in the premises, the clerk pretending to have resigned his
office. An alternative mandamus was issued commanding
Edwards, as supervisor of the township, forthwith to deliver
to the clerk of the board of supervisors of the county a statement of the claim of relator under and by virtue of the judgment.
Edwards duly filed a return, stating that he was not supervisor, and had no authority to perform the acts required of
him; that at the general. election of April 3, 1876, he was duly
elected supervisor, and qualified and entered upon his office,
and continued in office until the 7th of June, 1876, when he
resigned; that his resignation was in writing as follows: "To the township board of the township of St. Joseph, county
of Berrien, State ot Michigan: I hereby tender my resignation of
the office of supervisor of this township. St. Joseph, June 7, 1876.
"EDWARD M. EDWARDS."
(Signed)
That this written resignation was delivered to and filed by
the township clerk on the same day; that since then he, Edwards, had not been supervisor, nor had he acted as such, or
had charge of the records or papers of the office. He further

EDWARDS V. UNITED

STATES.

stated in his return that the township clerk bad never delivered to him any certified copy of any statement of the
moneys to be raised by taxation, either for the purpose of paying the claim of the relator, or for any other purpose.
To this return the relator demurred. The demurrer was
sustained, and a peremptory mandamnus awarded. Edwards
sued out this writ of error.
If we could, take notice of the affidavits annexed to the petition for aandamots,we should not have much difficulty in drawing the conclusion that the pretended resignations of the clerk
and supervisor were either simulated or made for the purpose
of evading compulsory performance of their duties. But the
return being demurred to must be taken as true, and the affidavits cannot be considered. The only question to decide, therefore, is whether the facts set forth in the return exhibit a good
and sufficient answer to the alternative writ; whether, in
other words, they show such a completed resignation on the
part of Edwards as amounts to a deposition of his office of
supervisor of the towniship. This is the issue made by the parties, and it is an issue of law. The plaintiff in error insists that
having done all that he could do to discharge himself from the
office, by filing a written resignation with the township clerk,
his resignation was complete. The defendant in error insists
that a resignation is not complete until it is accepted by the
proper authority. The question then is narrowed down to
this: was the resignation complete without an acceptance of it,
or something tantamount thereto, such as the appointment of a
successor?
As civil officers are appointed for the purpose of exercising
the functions and carrying on the operations of government, and
imintaining public order, a political organization would seem
to be imperfect which should allow the depositaries of its power
to throw off their responsibilities at their own pleasure. This
certainly was not the doctrine of the common law. In England
a person elected to a municipal office was obliged to accept it
and perform its duties, and he subjected himself to a penalty
by refusal. An office was regarded as a burden which the
.tppointee was bound, in the interest of the community and of
Iro'd government, to bear. And from this it followed of comse

EDWARDS V. UNITED STATES.

[Slip. 0t.

that, after an office was conferred and assumed, it could not be
laid down without the consent of the appointing power. This
was required in order that the public interests might suffer no
inconvenience for the want of public servants to execute the
laws. See 1 Kyd, Corporations, c. 3, sect. 4; Willcock, Corporations, pp. 129, 238, 239; Grant, Corporations, pp. 221,
223, 268; 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp., sect. 163; Rex v. Bwer,
1 Barn. & Cres. 585; Rex v. Burder, 4 T. R. 778; Rex v.
Lone, 2 Stra. 920; Rex v. Jones, id. 1146; Hoke v. Henderson, 4 Dev. (N. C.) L. 1; Van Orsdall v. Hazard, 3 Hill
(N. Y.), 243; State v. Perguson, 31 N. J. L. 107. This acceptance may be manifested either by a formal declaration, or by
the appointment of a successor. "To complete a resignation,"
says Mr. Willcock, "it is necessary that the corporation manifest their acceptance of the offer to resign, which may be
done by an entry in the public books, or electing another
person to fill the place, treating it as vacant." Willcock, Corporations, 239.
In this country, where offices of honor and emolument are
commonly more eagerly sought after than shunned, a contrary
doctrine with regard to such offices, and, in some States, with
regard to offices in general, may have obtained; but we must
assume that the common-law rule prevails unless the contrary
be-sliOwn. In Michigan we do not find that any contrary rule
has been adopted; on the contrary, the common-law rule seems
to be confirmed by the statutes of the State, so far as their
intent can be gathered from their specific provisions. By sect.
690 of the Compiled Laws of 1871, if any person elected to
a township office (except that of justice), of whom an oath is
required, and who is not exempt by law, shall not qualify within
ten days, he is subjected to a penalty of ten dollars. By sects.
691, 693, resignations of officers elected at township meetings
must be in writing, addressed to the township board, who is
authorized to make temporary appointments to fill vacancies.
The township board is composed of the supervisor, the two justices of the peace whose term of office will soonest expire, and
the township clerk, any three of whom constitute a quorum.
Sect. 706. Resignations of other officers are directed to be
made generally to the officer or officers who appointed them,

Oet. 1880.]

EDWARDS V. UNITED STATES.

or who may be authorized by law to order a special election to
fill the vacancy. Sect. 615. These provisions indicate a general intention in conformity with the principles of the common
law. They make the acceptance of a township office a duty,
and they direct resignations of office generally to be made to
those officers who are empowered either to fill the vacancy
themselves, or to call an immediate election for that purpose, the controlling object being to provide against the public detriment which would ensue from the continued or prolonged
vacancy of a public office. The same intention is manifested
by sect. 649, which prescribes the term of office of township
officers as follows: "Each of the officers elected at such meeting3 [that is, the annual meetings of the township], except
justices, commissioners of highways, and school inspectors, shall
hold his office for one year, and until his successor shall be
elected and dudy qualified." Here is manifested the same desire
to prevent a hiatus in the offices. There is nothing in the spirit
of this legislation to indicate that the common-law rule is discarded in Michigan.
Sect. 617 of the Compiled Laws declares that "every office
hall become vacant on the happening of either of the following
events before the expiration of the term of such office: "First,
the death of the incumbent; second, his resignation; third, his
removal from office," &c. But it is nowhere declared when a
resignation shall become complete. This is left to be determined upon general principles. And in view of the manifest
spirit and intent of the laws above cited, it seems to us apparent that the common-law requirement -namely, that a resignation must be accepted before it can be regarded as complete
- was not intended to be abrogated.
To hold it to be abrogated would enable every office-holder to throw off his official
character at will, and leave the community unprotected. We
do not think that this was the intent of the law.
The plaintiff in error has referred us to several authorities to
show that in this country the doctrine that a resignation to be
complete must be accepted, does not prevail. But whilst this
seems to be the rule in some States it is not the case in all. In
many States the common-law rule continues to prevail. In Hoke
v. Henderson, supra, decided in 1832, Mr. Chief Justice Ruffin.

EDWARDS v. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Or.

speaking for the Supreme Court of North Carolina, said: "An
officer may certainly resign; but without acceptance his resignation is nothing, and he remains in office. It is not true that
an office is held at the will of either party. It is held at the
will of both. Generally resignations are accepted; and that
has been so much a matter of course with respect to lucrative
offices, as to have grown into a common notion that to resign is
a matter of right. But it is otherwise. The public has a right
to the services of all the citizens, and may demand them in all
civil departments as well as in the military. Hence there are
on our statute book several acts to compel men to serve in
offices. Every man is obliged, upon a general principle, after
entering upon his office, to discharge the duties of it while he
continues in office, and he cannot lay it down until the public,
or those to whom the authority is confided, are satisfied that the
office is in a proper state to be left, and the officer discharged."
p. 29.' Similar views were expressed by Mr. Justice Cowen in
1842, in Van Orsdall v. Hazard, supra; and many commonlaw authorities on the subject were referred to. The Supreme
Court of New Jersey maintained the same doctrine in 1864 in
an able opinion delivered by the present learned Chief Jus
tice, in the case of State v. Ferguson, supra. Speaking of the
officer in question (an overseer of highways), the Chief Justice
said: "If he possess this power to resign at pleasure, it would
seem to follow, as an inevitable consequence, that he cannot be
compelled to accept the office. But the books seem to furnish
no warrant for this doctrine. To refuse an office in a public
corporation connected with local jurisdiction was a common-law
offence, and punishable by indictment." After reviewing the
authorities cited to the contrary, particularly that in 1 McLean,
509, the Chief Justice concludes: "I do not think any of the
other cases relied upon on the argument sustain in the least
degree the doctrine, but on the contrary they all imply that
the resignation, to be effectual, must be accepted."
In Gates v. Delaware County (12 Iowa, 405), referred to and
much relied on by the plaintiff in error, whilst the court asserts
tiat acceptance is not necessary, it nevertheless finds that there
was, in fact, an acceptance in that case. The county judge, to
whom the superintendent of schools addressed his resignation.

Out. 1880.]

cDWARDS V. UNITED STATES.

indorsed it "Resignation," and filed it in his office of the date
specified; which act, under the circumstances, was considered
by the court an acceptance. This case, therefore, cannot bb
regarded as definitively settling the doctrine even in Iowa.
Much reliance is also placed on the decision of Mr. Justice
McLean in the Circuit Court in United States v. Wright (1
McLean, 509), where Wright was sued as surety on a collector's
bond for delinquency committed by the collector after he had
sent his resignation .: the President, but before it was accepted. Mr. Justice McLean held that the resignation was
complete when received and that the defendant was not liable.
In announcing his decision he used this broad language:
"There can be no doubt that a civil officer has a right to resign
his office at pleasure, and it is not in the power of the Executive to compel him to remain in office." Mr. Chief Justice
Beabley, of New Jersey, in commenting upon this language in
State v. Perguson, already cited, justly observes: "It is hardly
to be supposed that it was the intention of the judge to apply
this remark to the class of officers who are elected by the people
and whose services are absolutely necessary to carry on local
government; or that it was the purpose to brush away with a
breath the doctrine of the common law, deeply rooted in public
policy upon the subject. However true the proposition may be
as applied to the facts then before the Circuit Court, it is
clearly inconsistent with all previous decisions, if eytended
over the class of officers where responsibility is the subjeat of
consideration."
But conceding that the law in some of the States is as contended for by the plaintiff in error,- and he cites cases to this
purpose decided in Alabama, Indiana, California, and Nevada,
- and conceding that Mr. Justice McLean's decision may have
been correct in the particular case before him, the question is,
what is the law of Michigan? and we think it has been shown
that the common-law rule is in force in that State.
Now, in the present case, it is true that the defendant in his
return avers that he resigned his office on the 7th of June,
1876. But lie does not stop here. He goes on to show precisely what he did do. His whole return on this branch of the
Bubject is as follows:-

EDWARDS V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

"That, at the general election of April 3, 1876, this respondent was duly elected the supervisor of said township of
St. Joseph, and on April 8, 1876, respondent qualified and
entered upon his office as such supervisor. That respondent
continued in said office of supervisor until the seventh day of
June, 1876, when this respondent resigned his office as such
supervisor. That such resignation was in writing, of which
the following is a true copy: "' To the township board of the township of St. Joseph, county
of Ber ien, and State of Michigan: I hereby tender my resignation
of the office of supervisor of this township. St. Joseph, June 7,
1876.
"' E D W A R D M. EDWARDS.'
" That said writing, of which the above is a copy, was signed
by this respondent, and after being so signed was by respondent
delivered to and filed by the township clerk of said township of
St. Joseph, and that said writing was so delivered to and filed
by said township clerk on the seventh day of June, 1876.
That since said seventh day of June, 1876, this respondent has
not been the supervisor of said township of St. Joseph. That
he has not acted or assumed to act as such supervisor in any
particular. That respondent has not, since said June 7, 1876,
had charge of any of the records or papers of said office of
supervisor."
It does not appear that the resignation was ever acted upon
by the township board, or that it was ever presented to or seen
by them, or that the board was ever convened after the resignation was filed. According to the common-law rule, the
resignation would not be complete, so as to take effect in vacating the office, until it was presented to the township board, and
either accepted by them or acted upon by making a new appointment. A new appointment would probably be necessary
in this case, because the township board was not the original
appointing power. The supervisor is not their officer, representative, or appointee. They only represent the township in
exercising the power, vested in them, of filling a vacancy when
it occurs. This makes them the proper body to receive the
resignation, because they are the functionaries whose duty it is
to act upon'it.

Oct. 1880.]

EDWARDS V. UNITED

STATES.

We think, therefore, that the return made to the alternative
vzanzdaunus did not sufficiently show that the defendant had
ceased to be supervisor of the township.
Other excuses for not obeying the mandamus are propounded
in the return, as follows: "Respondent further says that he has never had served upon
him in the cause in which said alternative writ issued, any process, notice, or paper of any kind, except said alternative writ.
" And respondent further shows that the township clerk of
said township of St. Joseph has never made and delivered to
respondent any certified copy of any statement on file or of
record in his office of the moneys to be raised by taxation,
either for the purpose of paying the alleged claim of the relator
or for any other purpose, and no statement whatever of the
clerk of said township with reference to the amount of money
to be raised for township purposes has ever been delivered to
respondent."
The plea of non-service of any other notice than the writ is
inadmissible. The appearance of the defendant and the actual
making of the return are a sufficient answer to it. Non-service
may be good ground for a motion to set aside proceedings based
on supposed service, but is not a good return to the writ.
The excuse that the clerk did not deliver to the defendant a
certified statement is evasive. Why did he not do so? Was
there collusion between them as stated in the petition for mandai,w.? The defendant does not state that the clerk refused
to deliver him a statement; nor that he, the defendant, applied
to the clerk for one. His own act, in repudiating his office,
might well have prevented the clerk from delivering a statement to him. It is to be presumed that, on reassuming his
duties, the clerk will recognize his official character and furnish the requisite statement. But if the clerk should refuse, it
would still be the defendant's duty as supervisor to see that
the claim of the relator, which is a fixed and indisputable liability of the township, and has been duly presented, is placed
before the board of supervisors, and put in the way of payment
by means of taxation.
We think the return was insufficient, and the demurrer was
well taken.
Judgment affirmed
