STEVENS v. FULLER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 1617. Submitted May .,1890.-

Decided May 19, 1890.

On a body execution issued against a debtor on a judgment in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, his arrest
was authorized on the ground that he had property not exempt which he
(lid not intend to apply to pay the judgment claun. Notice having been
given to the creditor that the debtor desired to take the oath for the
relief of poor debtors, his examination was begun before a United States
commissioner. Pending this, charges of fraud were filed against him,
in having fraudulently disposed of property, with a design to secure the
saine to his own use and to defraud his creditors. His examination as
a poor debtor was suspended, and a hearing was had on the charges of
fraud. After the testimony thereon was closed, the commissioner
refused to resume the poor debtor examination, and then sustained the
charges of fraud and sentenced the debtor to be imprisoned for six
months. His examination as a poor debtor was not read to him and
corrected, and he did not sign or swear to it, and the commissioner refused to administer to him the oath for the relief of poor debtors. He
was then taken into-custody under the execution and lodged in jail. On
a hearing on a writ of habeas corpus the Circuit Court discharged such
writ and remanded him to the custody of the marshal. On an appeal to
this court; Held, that the order must be affirmed.
As the commissioner had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person of the debtor, any errors or irregularities in the proceedings could
not be reviewed by the Circuit Court on habeas corpus, or by this court,
on the appeal.

Opinion of the Court.

Massachusetts, refusing to discharge him from custody on a
writ of habeas corpus. The following are the material
facts: William G. Fuller having recovered a judgment against
Stevens, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, for $18,000, an execution was issued
thereon to the marshal, which commanded him, if he could
find no property belonging to Stevens, to take his body and
commit him to jail. Accompanying that execution was an
affidavit made by Fuller, that the judgment in question
amounted to $20, exclusive of costs, and that $20 remained
uncollected, and that he believed, and had good reason to
believe, that Stevens had property not exempt from execution,
which he did not intend to apply to the payment of the judgment claim, and that he intended to leave the State and District of Massachusetts. Thereupon, a comnissioner of the
Circuit Court certified that, after due hearing, he was satisfied
that there was reasonable cause to believe that the charge
made- in the affidavit was true, and that, satisfactory cause
having been shown, he thereby authorized the arrest of Stevens, if his arrest was authorized by law, to be made after
sunset. Stevens was arrested and brought before Henry L.
Hallett, a United States commissioner for the District of Massachusetts, who interrogated him, and he declared that he did
not desire to take any oath, or to recognize, or to give bail for
his appearance at any time, and he 'failed'to recognize or give
bail. Thereafter, the commissioner gave notice to Fuller that
Stevens desired to take the oath for the relief of poor -debtors,
at a time specified and appointed, at the office of the commissioner. Stevens then gave a recognizance for his appearance,
at such time and place, to be examined. He dulyappeared and
submitted to be examined, protesting that the commissioner was
not authirized by law to order him to be examined touching
his property, and stating that he did not waive any informalities in his arrest or in any of the dther proceedings. His examination was begun and continued for some time. In the course
of it, he offered evidence from the court of insdlvency for the
county of Suffolk, in the district, that proceedings in insolvency had been begun by him and were thbn pending. There-

upon, Fuller filed with the commissioner charges of fraud
against Stevens, alleging that Stevens, since he had contracted
the debt for which the judgment was rendered, had fraudulently conveyed, concealed or otherwise disposed of some part
of his estate, with a design to secure the same to his own use
and to defraud his creditors, and specifying the particulars of
seven different conveyances of land, and a mortgage of land,
and three payments of money, by him with such design. The
examination of Stevens as a poor debtor was suspended by
the commissioner, and a hearing was had before him on such
charges of fraud." Stevens put m a plea of want of jurisdic-

These proceedings were had pursuant to provisions in Pub. Stats. Mass.

for Suffolk County, and all of his right, title and interest in
the property mentioned in the charges of fraud had becomie
vested in said court of insolvency At the same time, he filed
with the commissioner a motion to quash the charges, on the
ground that it appeared therefrom that the property alleged
was conveyed by him while he was a resident in and a citizen
of New Hampshire, and was conveyed by him in New Hampshire, and not within the jurisdiction of the courts of Massais arrested or committed, his goods, effects or credits not exempt from
being taken on execution but which cannot be attached by ordinary process
of law, without first having offered such goods, effects or credits to the
arresting creditor in satisfaction or part satisfaction of his debt, the'

provided for filing charges of fraud. The plaintiff or creditor shall not
upon the hearing give evidence of a charge of fraud not made or filed as
herein provided, nor of a fraudulent act of the debtor committed more
than three years before the commencement of the original action.

chusetts, or of the commissioner, or of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Massachusetts, and that he
could not be tried by such commissioner, 6r sentenced by him
thereon, if found guilty, and also, because all of the charges
were vague, and did not, with sufficient certainty set forth
any fraudulent transfer of any property belonging to him.
Afterwards, an assignment in insolvency of the estate, real
and personal, of Stevens, was made by the judge of the court
of insolvency, to duly appointed assignees. After the close of
the testimony before the commissioner on the charges of fraud,
and before his decision thereon was rendered, Stevens requested that-. his examination as a poor debtor be again taken
'up, and he be allowed to offer evidence of his releases and
conveyance to his assignees in insolvency, at their request, of
all his title to the estates so charged to have been fraudulently
conveyed !by him, and requested also that he be allowed to
complete his own examination as a poor debtor, which requests were refused by the commissioner.
On the 25th of January, 1890, the commissioner gave his
decision on the charges offraud, sustaining them and finding
Stevens guilty thereof, and sentencing him to be imprisoned
for six months in the jail at Boston. Stevens appealed from
that decision to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Massachusetts, and gave a recognizance with sureties. Thereafter, but on the same day, and before any other
or further order or act of' the commissioner, and before any
finding made on the charge in the affidavit which accompanied the execution as to property, Stevens 'again requested
that his examination as a poor debtor, so suspended, be taken
up, and he be permittel to offer evidence of tbe releases and
conveyance above mentioned, and also to complete his own
examination as -a poor debtbr. Both of such requests were
refused by the commissioner, and the'examination of Stevens
as a poor debtor was not completed. No other witness than

and no other evidence except such assignment in insolvency.
was offered thereon, except that partly given by him. His
examination was not read to him and corrected, and he did

not sign or swear to it. On the same day the commissioner
made a certificate that it appeared that Stevens "has property and estate to the amount of twenty dollars, besides the
estate, goods and chattels which are by law exempt from
being taken on execution," and that, after due examination
of him, the commissioner refused to administer to him the
oath for the relief of poor debtors. Thereupon Stevens was
taken into custody by the marshal of the district, under the
execution, and lodged in the Suffolk County jail, where he
was detained.
On the foregoing facts, Stevens, on the 28th of January,
1890, obtained from the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of MKassachusetts a writ of habeas copus,
returnable in that court. At the hearing thereon evidence
was introduced by both parties as to what took place at the
heering before the commissioner on the 25th of January,
1890, and the commissioner himself was examined as a witness. The Circuit Court ordered that the writ of habeas
copus be discharged and that Stevens be remanded to the
custody of the marshal. To review that order Stevens has
taken an appeal to this court.
The Circuit Court stated its decision and the grounds thereof
in these words "The court decided that, although no formal
request appeared to have been made by either party before
the commissioner that the examination of the debtor should be
in writing, yet, as it was in fact taken in writing, and this
mode of proceeding was adopted with the assent of both parties, this was equivalent to a previous formal request that it
should be so taken, that, as the examination was not signed,
and sworn to by the debtor, as required by the statute, and no
opportunity was given him to sign and swear to it, and he
never refused to do so, the examination was imperfect and
incomplete, and had not reached a stage to justify the commissioner in assuming to pass upon the question whether the
debtor was entitled to be admitted to take the oath for the
relief of poor debtors, that the commissioner's certificate annexed to the execution was, therefore, premature and irregular, that this irregularity did not, however, have the effect to

STEVENS v. FULLER.

Opinion of the Court.

render all the proceedings before him absolutely void, so as to
authorize the court to direct the discharge of the debtor from
custody upon this writ, and thus deprive the creditor of his
right to hold the body of the debtor for his debt, but that the
debtor's remedy was rather by application to the court to set
aside the certificate as irregular, and to direct that he might
go at large under his old recognizance, or upon a new recognizance, and that the examination might proceed before the commissioner, and when completed, a new adjudication be made
by him."
We are of opinion that the order of the Circuit Court must
be affirmed. The matters alleged before that court against
the action of the commissioner did not go to the question of
his jurisdiction, so as tomake such action reviewable on habeas
colypus by the Circuit Court. He had jurisdiction of the
subject matter and of the person of Stevens, under the proceedings instituted in conformity with the statutes of Massachusetts. The objections taken on the part of Stevens, at the
hearing before the commissioner, and also urged here, to the
proceedings before the commissioner, all of them went only to
alleged errors and irregdlarities 'in those proceedings, which
could not be reviewed by the Circuit Court on a writ of habeas
corpus, and cannot be taken cognizance of by this court on
this appeal.
It was proper for the Circuit Court to admit in evidence the
poor debtor examination before the commissioner, and the evidence offered before him on the charges of fraud.
It is conceded in the brief of the counsel for Stevens that
the proper affidavit was made and the proper certificate of the
commissioner was annexed to the execution authorizing the
arrest. The points urged before the Circuit Court and urged
here, that Stevens was entitled to have his examination as a
poor debtor read over to him, and to have it corrected, and
to sign and swear to it, and the other points raised by him as
to the proceedings before the commissioner, are mere qilestions of irregularity, not reviewable by the Circuit Court on
habea.s co:pus, or by this court on this appeal.
This rule is well established in cases of original writs of

The same doctrine applies to the Circuit Court in the present case in its review on habeas corpus of the proceedings before the commissioner, and it has been applied by this court

matter and of the person, and that irregularities, if any,
occurring in the mee conduct of the case, do not affect the
validity of its final order. Its judgment, so far as it involved
mere errors, cannot be reviewed in this collateral proceeding,
and must be affirmed."
