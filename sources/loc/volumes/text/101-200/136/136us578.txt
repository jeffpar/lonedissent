in command of the said navy-yard at the time the suit was
brought, and- had no other interest in the controversy
" The case was tried without a jury, under a stipulation in
writing, and judgment rendered for the plaintiffs, to the effect
that they were entitled to the possession of the lands in controversy
"This writ of error raises but one question.
"The plaintiffs claimed title to the swamp and overflowed
lands in question, under the State of California, and introduced
in evidence a patent from the State to one John W Pearson,
from whom they derived title.
"This evidence was objected to by the defendant on the
' That a patent issued by the State to any individground
ual for swamp or overflowed lands does not convey title to
the lands therein described, unless it be shown that the same
lands have been patented by the United States to the State,
or listed to the State by the Land Department of the United
States. That it has not been shown by competent evidence
that it has %een determined by the proper authority of the
Land Department of the United States that the lands described in the patent, or any part thereof, are swamp or
overflowed lands within the meaning of the act of Congress
approved September 28, 1850, commonly known as the Arkansas land act.'
"The objection was overruled and the patent read to the
jury, whereupon the defendant excepted.
"The plaintiffs then introduced other evidence, parol and
documentary,. for the purpose of showing that the land sued
for answered to the description of swamp and overflowed
lands, and the defendant moved the court to strike out and,
exclude all said evidence, including the patent, but the court
denied the motion, and thereupon the defendant excepted.
"The opinion of the eminent Circuit Justice upon the questions raised by the bill of exceptions, appears to be sustained
by the subsequent opinion of this court in Wrsglt v Rosebrry,
121 U. S.488.
"The case is, therefore, submitted without further observation."
