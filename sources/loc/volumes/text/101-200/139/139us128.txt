COVINGTON STOCK-YARDS COMPANY v. KEITH.
APPEAT FROM THE

CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE

UNITED

STATES FOR

THE DISTRICT OF'KENTUCKY.
No. 23. Submitted October 22, 1890. - Decided March 2, 1891.

A railroad company, holding itself out as a carrier of live stock, is under a
legal obligation, arising out of the nature of its employment, to provide
suitable and necessary means and facilities for receiving live stock that
may ne offered for shipment over its road and connectionS, as well as for
discharging such stock after it reaches the place to which it is consigned.
The duty to receive such stock cannot be efficiently.discharged, at least in
a town or city, without the aid of inclosed yards in which the stock
offered for shipment can be received and handled with safety and without
inconvenience to the public, ihile being loaded upon the ears in which
they are to be transported. And the duty of the carrier to deliver cannot
be safely and effectively performed except in and through inclosed yards
or lots convenient to the place of unloading.
A carrier of live stock must be at all times in proper condition both to
receive from the shipper and to deliver to the consignee, according to
the nature of the property to be transported, as well as to the necessities
of the respective localities in which it is received and delivered. It
cannot, in addition to the customary and legitimate charges for transportation, make, or allow any agent it employs to make a special charge
for merely receiving or merely delivering such stock in and through
yards provided for that purpose.
In respect to the mere loading and unloading of the stock at a particular
city, the carrier is required by the nature of its employment to furnishsuch suitable and convenient appliances as are reasonably sufficient for
the business at that place.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinionof the court.
On the 28th of January, 1886, George T. Bliss and Isaac E.
Gates instituted in the court below a suit in equity against the
Kentucky Central Railroad Company, a corporation of Ken-

tucky, for the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust given
.to secure the payment of bonds of that company for a large
amount; ini which su.it a receiver was appointed who took
possession'of the railroad, with authority to operate it until
the further order of the court.
The present proceeding was begun on the 18th of June,
1886, by a petition filed in the f6reclosure suit by Charles W.
Keith, who was engaged in buying and selling on commission,
as well as on his own account, live stock brought to and shipped
from the city of Covington, Kentucky, over the Kentucky
Central Railroad. The petition proceeded upon the ground
that unjust and illegal discrimination had been and was being
made against Keith by the receiver acting under and pursuant
to a written agreement made November 19, 1881, between
the railroad company and the Covington Stock-Yards Company, a corporation created under the general laws of Kentucky; the yards of the latter company located in Covington,
and connected with the railroad tracks in that city, being the
only depot of the railway company that was provided with
the necessary platforms and chutes for receiving or discharging live stock on and from its trains at that city. The petition alleged that Keith was the proprietor of certain live-stock
lots and yards in that city immediately west of those-belong-.
ing to the Covington Stock-Yards Company, and separated
from them by only onie street sixty feet in width; that he was
provided with all the necessary means of receiving, feeding
-and caring for such stock as he purchased, or as might be consigned to him by others for sale; and-that his lots and yards
were used for that purpose subsequently to Mvfarch 1, 1886,
and until, by the direction of the receiver, the platforms connecting ihem with the railroad were torn up and rendered
unfit for use. The prayer of the' petitioner was for a rule
against the receiver to show cause why he should not deliver
to him at some convenient and .suitable place outside of the
lots or yards of the said Covington Stock-Yards Company
free from other than the customary freight charges- for transportation, all stock owned by or consigned to him and brought
over said roadt to Covington.
'VOL. Cxxxix-9

OCTOBER TERTI, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The receiver filed a response to the rule, and an order was
entered giving leave to the Covington Stock-Yards Company
to file an intervening petition against the railroad company
and Keith, and requiring the latter parties to litigate between
themselves the question of the validity of the above agreement of 1881. The Stock-Yards Company filed such a petition, claiming all the rights granted by the agreement referred
to, and alleging that it had expended sixty thousand dollars in
constructing depots, platforms and chutes, as required by that
agreement.
Referring to that agreement it appears that the Stock-Yards
Company stipulated that its yards on the line of the railroad
in Covington should be maintained in good order, properly
equipped with suitable fencing, feeding-pens and other customary conveniences for handling and caring for live- stock, and
to that end it would keep at hand a sufficient number of skilled
workmen to perform the operations required of it, and generally to do such labor as is usually provided for in stock yards
of the best class, namely, to load and unload and care for "in
the best manner all live stock delivered to them by the party
of the first part [the railroad company] at their own risk of
damage while so doing, and in no event to charge more than
sixty cents per car of full loads for loading and sixty cents per
car for unloading, and no charges to be made for handling
less than full loads, as per way-bills." The Stock-Yards Company also agreed to become liable for those charges, and to
collect and pay over to the railroad company, as demanded
from time to time, such money as came into its hands, the
charges for feeding and caring for live stock not to be more
than was charged for similar services and supplies at other
stock yards of the country. The railroad company, upon its
part, agreed to pay the Stock-Yards Company the above sums
for loading and unloading and otherwise acting as its agent in,
the collection of freights and charges upon such business as
was turned over to it by the railroad company; that it would
require all cars loaded at yards for shipment South or East to
be carefully bedded, which the Stock-Yards Company was to
do at the rates usually charged in other yards; that it would

COVII4GTON STOCK-YARDS CO. v. KEITH.
Opinion of the Court.

make the yards of the Stock-Yards Company its "depot for
delivery of all its live stock," during the term of the contract,
and not build, "nor allow to be built, on its right of way, any
other dep'ot or yards for the reception of live stock." The
delivery of stock in cars on switches or sidings provided for
the purpose was to be considered a delivery of the stock to the
Stock-Yards Company, which, from that time, was to be responsible for the stock to the railroad company. To protect
the business of the Stock-Yards Company from damage in
case the railroad extended its track over the Ohio River, the
railroad company agreed that during the term of the contract
the rate of freight from all points on its road and connections
should "not be less than five dollars per car more to the Union
Yards of Cincinnati than the rate to Covington yards from the
same points;" that its business arrangements with any other
railroad or transportation line should be subject to this agreement; and that the yards of the Stock-Yards Company "shall
be the depot for all live stock received from its connections for
Cincinnati or Eastern markets." The agreement by its terms
was to remain in force for fifteen years.
In the progress of the cause E. W. Wilson, by consent of parties, was made a co-petitioner and co-respondent with Keith.
. By the final decree it was found, ordered and decreed as
follows: "It is the duty and legal obligation of the Kentucky
Central Railroad Company, as a common carrier of live stock,
to provide suitable and convenient means and facilities for
receiving on board its cars all live stock offered for shipment
over its road and its connections from the city of Covington,
and for the discharge from its cars of -all live stock brought
over its road to the said city of Covington, free of any charge
other than the customary transportation charges to consignors
or consignees; and that the said petitioners, Keith and Wilson.
live-stock dealers and brokers, doing business at the city o
Covington, and proprietors of the Banner Stock-Yards at that
place, are entitled to so ship and receive over said road such
live stock without being subject to any-such adlditional charges
imposed by said receiver, said railroad company, or other person or corpo'ration. The court further finds and decrees that

132

Opinion of the Court.

the alleged contract entered into by and between the said rail-.
road company and the said Covington Stock-Yards Company,
of date the 19th day of November, 1881, does not entitle the
said Stock-Yards Company to impose upon any shipper of live
stock over said road, passing such stock through the yards of
said company to and from the cars of said railroad company,
any charge whatever for such passage. It is stipulated in
said contract that said Stock-Yards Company shall establish
and maintain suitable yards or pens for receiving, housing, feeding and caring for live stock, and to receive all such stock,
and load and unload the same upon and from the"cars of said
company transported on or to be transported over said road
for a compensation of sixty cents per car load, to be paid by
said railroad company for and during the period of fifteen
years from the date of said contract, which has not yet expired, while the said railroad company agreed that it would
not during said period establish or allow to be established on
the line of its road or on its right of way in said city of Covington any other platform or depot than that of said Stock-Yards
Company for the receipt or delivery of such live stock.
The court doth further find that the general freight depot
of the said railroad company in the said city of Covington, at
the terminus of its'road between Pike and Eighth Streets, is
not a suitable or convenient place for the receipt and delivery
of live stock brought to the said city or to be shipped therefrom over said road, and neither said railroad company nor
said receiver having provided such suitable depot or place
therefor, except the yards of said Stock-Yards Company, it is,
now ordered and decreed that the said railroad company and
said receiver shall hereafter receive and deliver from and to
the said Keith & Wilson at and through the said Covington
stock yards all such live stock as may be brought to them or
offered by them for shipment over said road and its connections, upon the consent of said stock yards, in writing, that it

may be so done, being filed in this court and cause on or before the 1st day'of January next after the entry of this decree,
free of any charge for passing through said yards to and from
the cars of said railroad company. In default of such consent

COVINGTON STOCK-YARDS CO. v. KEITH.
Opinion of the Court.

-

being so filed, it is ordered and decreed that upon said Keith
& Wilson putting the platform and chute erected by them on
the land of said Keith adjacent to the live-stock switch of said
railroad company north of said stock yards the said railroad
company and said receiver shall receive and deliver all such
live stock to said Keith & Wilson as shall be consigned to
them or either of them or be offered by them or either of
them for shipment at said platform. The said Keith & Wilson shall provide an agent or representative at said- platform
to receive such cattle as they may be notified by said railroad
company or said receiver are to be delivered to them thereat,
and they shall give the said railroad company, or said receiver
reasonable notice of any shipment desired to be made by them
from'said platform to conform to the departure of live-stock
trains on said road."
The railroad company, holding itself out as a carrier of live
stock, was under a legal obligation, arising out of the nature
of its employment, to provide, suitable and necessary means
and facilities for receiving live stock offered to it for shipment
over its road and connections, as -well as for discharging such
stock after it reaches the place to which it is consigned. The
vital question in respect to such matters is, whether the means
and facilities so furnished by the carrier or by some one in its.
behalf are sufficient foi the reasonable accommodation of the
public. But, it is- contended, that the decree is erroneous so
far as it compels the railroad company to receive live stobk
offered by the appellees for shipment and to deliver live stock
consigned to them, free from any charge other than the customary one for transportation, for merely passing into and
through the yards of the Covington Stock-Yards Company to
and froni the cars of the railroad company. As the decree
does not require such stock to be delivered in or through the
yards of the appellant, except with its written consent filed in
this cause; as such stock cannot be properly loaded upon or
unloaded from cars within the limits of the city, except by
means of inclosed lots or yards set apart for that purpose, and
conveniently located, in or through which the stock may be
received froim the shipper or delivered to the consignee, with-

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

out danger or inconvenience to the public in the vicinity of
the place of shipment or discharge; and as the appellant has
voluntarily undertaken to discharge the duty in these matters
that rests upon the railroad company, the contention just
adverted to, is, in effect, that the carrier may, without a
special contract for that purpose, require the shipper or consignee, in addition to the customary and legitimate charges
for transportation, to compensate it for supplying the means
and facilities that must be provided by it in order to meet its
obligations to the public. To this proposition we cannot give
our assent.

When animals are offered to a carrier of live stock to be
transported it is its duty to receive them; and that duty cannot be efficiently discharged, at least in a town or city, without the aid of yards in which the stock offered for shipment
can be received and handled with safety and without inconvenience to the public while being loaded upon the cars in
which they are to be transported. So, when live stock reach
the place to which they are consigned, it is the duty of the
carrier to deliver them to the consignee; and such delivery
cannot be safely or effectively made except in or through
inclosed yards or lots, convenient to the place of unloading.
In other words, the duty to receive, transport and deliver live
stock will not be fully discharged, unless the carrier makes
such provision, at the place of loading, as will enable it to
properly receive and load the stock, and such provision, at the
place of unloading, as will enable it to properly deliver the
stock to the consignee.
A railroad company, it is true, is not a carrier of live stock
with all the responsibilitieg that attend it as a carrier of goods.
IYortA Penn. Railroad v. Commercial Bank, 123 U. S. '727,
734. There are recognized limitations upon the duty and
responsibility of carriers of inanimate property that do not
apply to carriers of live stock. These limitations arise from
the nature of the particular property transported. "1But,'
this court said, in the case just cited, "notwithstanding this
difference in duties and responsibilities, the railroad company,
when it un(lertakes generally to carry such freight, becomes

Opinion of the Court.

subject, under similar conditions, to the same obligations, so
far as the delivery of the animals which are safely transported
is concerned, as in the case of goods. They are to be delivered
at the place of destination to the party designated to receive
them if he presents himself, or can with reasonable efforts be
found, or to his order. No obligation of the carrier, whether
the freight consists of goods or live stock, is more strictly
enforced." ' The same principle necessarily applies to the
receiving of live stock by the carrier for transportation. The
carrier must at all times be in proper condition both to receive
from the shipper and to deliver to the consignee, according to
the nature of the property to be transported, as well as to the
necessities of the respective localities in which it is received
and delivered. A carrier of live stock has no more right to
make a special charge for merely receiving or merely delivering such stock, in and through stock yards provided by itself,
in order that it may properly receive and load, or unload and
deliver, such stock, than a carrier of passengers may make a
special charge for the use of its passenger depot by passengers
when proceeding to or coming from its trains, or than a
carrier may, charge the shipper for the use of its general
freight depot in merely delivering his goods for shipment, or
the consignee of such goods for its use in merely receiving
them there within a reasonable time after they are unloaded
from the cars. If the carrier may not make such special
charges in respect to stock yards which itself owns, maintains
or controls, it cannot invest another corporation or company

Opinion of the Court.

with authority to impose burdens of that kind upon shippers
and consignees. The transportation of live stock begins with
their delivery to the carrier to be loaded upon its cars, and
ends only after the stock is unloaded and delivered, or offered
to be delivered, to the consignee, if to be found, at such place
as admits of their being safely taken into possession..
We must not be understood as holding that the railroad
company, in this case, was under any legal obligation to furnish, or cause to be furnished, suitable and convenient, appli-.
ances for receiving and delivering live stock at every point on
its line, in the city of Covington where persons engaged in buying, selling or shipping live stock, chose to establish stock
yards. In respect to the mere loading and unloading of live
stock, it is only required by the nature of its employment to'
furnish such facilities as are reasonably sufficient for the business at that city. So far as the record discloses, the yards
maintained by the appellants are, for the purposes just stated,
equal to all the needs, at that city, of shippers and consignees
of live stock; and if the appellee had been permitted to use
them, without extra charge for mere "yardage," they would
have beeh without just ground of complaint in that regard;
for it did not concern them whether the railroad company
itself maintained stock yards, or employed another company
or corporation to supply the facilities for receiving and delivering live stock it was under obligation to the public to furnish.
But as the appellaut did not accord to appellees the privileges
they were entitled to from its principal, the carrier, and as the
carrier did not offer to establish a stock yard of its own for
shippers and consignees, the court below did not err in requiring the railroad company and the receiver to receive and
deliver live stock from and to the appellees at their own stock
yards in the immediate vicinity of appellant's yards, when the
former -wereput in proper condition to be used for that pur-pose, under such reasonable regulations as the railroad company might establish. It was not within the power of the
railroad company, by such an agreement as that of November
19, 1881, or by agreement in any form, to burden the appellees
with charges for services it was bbund to render without any

I'No.
155. Submitted January 21, 1891. -Decided March 2, 1891.
Limitations upon the power of a trustee in a railroad mortgage to take proceedings to enforce payment of the amount secured should be construed strictly.
A provision in a mortgage that the mode of sale provided by it "shall be
exclusive of all others" is an attempt to provide against a remedy in the
ordinary course of judicial proceedings and oust the jurisdiction of the
courts, and is therefore invalid.
A provision in a statute authorizing notice to be given to an absent defendant to appear, by publishing the same in a newspaper once a week for
four months, is not satisfied by a publication once a week for four lunar
months; but the word" month" when so used signifies a calendar month.
To support a decree for foreclosure against an absent defendant brought
in by publication, publication for the full period required is necessary.

1882, by the Green Cove Springs and Melrose Railroad Company to the plaintiff to secure its bonds, and the bill averred
