FOGG v. BLAIR.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 135. Argued January 6, 1891.-

Decided March 2, 1891.

-It is the settled doctrine of this court, as well as of the Supreme Court of
Missouri, that unpaid subscriptions to the stock of a corporation constitute a trust fund for the benefit of creditors, which may not be given
away or disposed of by it, without consideration or fraudulently, to the
prejudice of creditors.
While it is competent for a railroad corporation in Missouri, exercising
good faith, to use its bonds and stock in payment for the construction of
its road, it could not rightfully, at least, as against creditors 'or stockholders, issue its stock to contractors as full paid, without getting some
fair or reasonable equivalent for it. What is such equivalent depends
primarily upon the actual value of the stock at the time it was contracted
to be issued, and upon the compensation which, under all the circumstances, the contractors were equitably entitled to receive for the particular work undertaken or done by them. The corporation could not,
by its directors, sell or dispose of its assets to the prejudice of creditors
and stockholders, under such circumstances, on such terms, and at such
prices as indicated, upon the face of the transaction, that they were being
squandered recklessly or fraudulently in disregard of the trust committed
to them.
In a suit brought against contractors for the construction of a railroad to
hold them liable for the face value of stock received by them, in payment for work done, the bill alleged that they got $12,000 in the company's first mortgage bonds, for each mile of constructed road, and, in
addition, $850,000 in its stock, and that the mortgage bonds received by
them were full and adequate compensation for the work; but there was
no allegation as to the real value of the stock. Held, that the bill was
bad on demurrer; that it should have shown that the stock was of some
value; and that the general allegations thaf the arrangement was a
"fkaud," a "breach of trust," a "scheme," and "colorable," without
stating the ultimate facts upon which they were based, were only allegations of conclusions of law, which the demurrer to the bill did not
admit.

THE court stated the case as follows:

The appellant Fogg brought this suit to recover from the
appellee Blair the amount of a judgment obtained by him

Statement of the Case.

against an insolvent railroad corporation. The general ground
upon'which it is sought to make the appellee liable is, that he
holds stock of that corporation upon which he is alleged to
owe more than is sufficient to discharge appellant's judgment
against it.
The case 'was determined upon demurrer to the bill, which
makes the following showing: The St. Louis and Keokuk
Railroad Company, a c6rporation of Missouri created by an
act approved February 1v, 1857, was authorized to constrqct a
railroad from some suitable point on the North Missouri Railroad, not exceeding thirty miles west of St. Charles in that
State, by way of Louisiana, Hannibal, La Grange and Canton,
to some point near the mouth of the Des 'Moines River on the
northern boundary of Missouri. Between January 1, 1867,
and May 1, 1880, it located its line between Gilmore about
nineteen miles west of St. Charles and Alexandria at the mouth
of that river, running in a northerly direction through St.
Charles County to Lincoln County by the way of Troy to a
point near Prairieville, a distance of thirty-eight miles. It
was also located from the Fair Grounds near Hannibal by the
way of New London to Frankfort in Pike County. The road
between the two places last named' a distance of eighteen
miles, was completed and a large amount of grading was done
in Lincoln County on the line located. The sum of $300,000
was expended in grading in that county. In the progress of
the work the company became indebted in large amounts. to a
considerable number of persons, the plaintiff Fogg among the
number.
On the 22d of September, 1870, Fogg and the railroad company had a final settlement of their respective claims, showing
due him the sum of $9547.75 for labor done and money furnished in the location and construction of the railroad.
Subsequently, June 3, 1872, nearly all of the stockholders
and directors, and all of the executive officers, of the St. Louis
and Keokuk Railroad Company entered into articles of association, and organized under the General Statutes of Missouri
a ne-corporation named the St. Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk
Railroad Company, with a capital.stock of $6,000,000 divided

into 60,000 shares of $100 each, for the purpose of building a
railroad between the points named in the charter of the St.
Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company, and over most of the
same ground upon which the latter company located and
graded its road as above stated.
On the 3d of March, 1873, the St. Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company, by deed, assigned and transferred to the St.
Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company its entire line
of railroad, completed as well as unfinished, together with all
its property of every kind and nature, without paying the
plaintiff's debt or said other debts, and by such assignment and
transfer rendered itself incapable of doing so. But in such
deed it expressly stipulated and required the St. Louis, Hannibal
and Keokuk Railroad Company to assume the said debts, including the plaintiff's, and the latter company did expressly
assume and agree with the other company to pay the above
debts of plaintiff and others. The St. Louis, Hannibal and
Keokuk iRailroad Company took possession of the railroad and
all the property so assigned and transferred to it, and there was
no other consideration for the assignment and transfer than its
assumption of the above debts.
In an action at law brought by the plaintiff, September 22,
1880, in the court below, against the two companies, it was
held that he could not recover against the St. Louis, Hannibal
and- Keokuk Railroad Company the amount of his claim.
Thereupon that action was dismissed ag to that company; and
at a secdnd trial the plaintiff obtained judgment against the
St. Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company for $16,496.06 and
costs, upon which execution was issued and returned no property found. Afterwards, on the 5th of May, 1884, in a suit in
equity in the court below, the plaintiff recovered a judgment
against both companies for the full amount of his judgment,
with interest and costs.
On the 24th 'of February, 1881, the defendant Blair, a citizen
of New Jersey, and Moses Taylor entered into a written contract with the St. Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company for the grading of its road, or so much thereof as remained
ungraded between the south line of Pike County near Prairie-

Statement of the Case.

vile, and some point on the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific
IRailioad between Wentzville and Peruque, for the building of
bridges thereon, and for furnishing therefor all the materials,
including the ties and rails, for the tracks of the road; the
work to be completed and finished on or before the 31st of
December, 1881, and to be equal in construction and materials
to the part of the road then completed. In consideration of
the work so to be done the company covenanted and agreed
to pay and deliver to Blair and Taylor first mortgage bonds of
the company equal to tne sum of $12,000 for each mile of constructed road, and $850,000 par value of the capital stock of
the company, in full payment for the construction of said part
of its road.
In pursuance of that contract, Blair and Taylor constructed
and completed such part of the road on or about July 15, 1882,
making connection with the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific
Railroad, at Gilmore, a length of thirty-eight miles of main
track and two miles of side track, receiving from the railroad
company its first mortgage bonds to the amount of $480,000
(equal to $12,000 per mile of main and side tracks) and a certificate, each, for 4250 shares of its full paid stock of the par
value of $425,000. It is alleged in the bill that the work done
by them C"was not worth more than $12,000 per mile ;" that
the first mortgage bonds delivered to them constituted "a full
and adequate consideration for all the work done on said part
of said railroad by said Blair and Taylor under said contract ;"
that the issuing and delivery "of said certificates for said 4250
full paid shares each in the capital stock of said St. Louis,
Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company to said Blair and
Taylor,.as aforesaid, was without any valuable consideration
paid or moving from said Blair and Taylor or either of them
to said railroad company, and there was no consideration for
said stock and the agreement on the part of said St. Louis,
Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company;" that "the agreement on the part of the said St. Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk
Railroad Company to issue and deliver to said Blair and Taylor
shares in its capital stock to the amount of $850,000, pretendingly in part payment for the completion of said part of said

railroad between the south line of Pike County, lissouri, near
Prairieville in said county, and Gilmore on the Wabash, St.
Louis and Pacific Railroad, as aforesaid, was only colorable
and was a scheme on the part of said Blair and Taylor to get
said stock without paying therefor, and it was a fraud upon
your orator and other creditors of said St. Louis, Hannibal and
Keokuk Railroad Company," and "the making of said contract
and issue and delivery by the directors and officers of the St.
Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company of said certificates for said 4250 shares each of full-paid stock in the
capital stock of said company to said Blair and Taylor without
receiving the par value thereof either in money or work was a
breach of trust, of which said Blair and Taylor had full knowledge and notice;" that "the said stock in the hands of said
Blair and Taylor was and is null and void as against your
orator and other creditors of said St. Louis, Hannibal and
Keokuk Railroad Company;" and that by reason of the premises Blair still owes that company the sum of $425,000 for the
4250 shares of its stock delivered to him as aforesaid.
It further appears from the bill that in a suit to foreclose a
deed of trust executed August 1, 1877, by the St. Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company to secure the payment
of certain bonds, in which suit the present plaintiff was a
defendant, the railroad and all the property appurtenant
thereto were sold and purchased by John I. Blair for the sum
of $370,000, which amount was not sufficient to pay the bonds
secured by the deed of trust. In. that suit Fogg's judgment,'
then amounting to $18,365.11 and costs, was adjudged to be
junior and inferior to the lien of the deed of trust. 25 Fed.
Rep. 684; 27 Fed. Rep.-176; -Fogg v. Blair, 133 U. S. 534.
The St. Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company and the St.
Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad Company are both insolvent. The latter company has no officers and keeps no office;
and the foreclosure and sale of its property has practically
dissolved it as a corporation; and John I. Blair is the only
stockholder of that company whose stock is known to the
plaintiff to be unpaid, and who is within the jurisdiction of
the court below.

Argument for Appellant.

The plaintiff, proceeding in his present bill on the ground
that the stock of the St. Louis, Hannibal and Keokuk Railroad
Company is a trust fund for the payment of its debts, prays
that the certificate to Blair of 4250 shares of full-paid stock
be cancelled, and that he be decreed to pay to the plaintiff the
full amount of his decree against that company, and also the
full amount of the judgment, interest and costs, of such other
unsatisfied judgment creditors of that company as shall come
in and contribute to the expenses of this suit in proportion to
their respective demands; and that the plaintiff and other
unsatisfied judgment creditors of the St. Louis, Hannibal and
Keokuk Railroad Company have such relief as may be equitable.

The capital stock of a corporation is a trust fund for the
payment of its creditors. Sawyer v. Hoag, 17 Wall. 610;

91 U. S. 56; County of iforgan v. Allen, 103 U. S.498 ; Jacksow v. Taer, 64 Iowa, 469. The directors of a corporation are
trustees of its capital stock with all the duties and obligations
of trustees resting on them; and in the management of capital stock they are bound to exercise sound judgment, integrity
and good faith in disposing of it. Jackson v. Ludeling, 21
Wall. 616; Upton v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S. 45; Bouton v.

Capital stock, being a trust fund, may be followed by creditors in, a court of equity, into the hands of every person who
is not a lonaftde purchaser thereof for value without notice,
and such persons held as trustees to the extent of the trust
fund in their hands. Sanger v. Vpton, 91 U. S. 56; IFood v.

valid as against creditors. Sawyer v. .Heoag, 17 Wall. 610;

An agreement beiween a corporation and its stockholders
that the'stock shall be considered full paid and non-assessable
upon the payment of a certain per cent of its par value is
binding on the corporation and estops it from making any further calls on the stockholders. But if the corporation shall
become i.nsolvent, such agreement does not estop unsatisfied
judgment creditors of the corporation from subjecting the unpaid balance on the stock to the payment of their judgments.

A sale of a railroad far below its value under a foreclosure
decree obtained by virtue of a collusive agreement between
the directors of the company seeking to escape liability as indorsers therefor, and the purchasers, is not binding on the
creditors, and such sale will be set aside and held for naught
and the purchasers held as trustees for the creditors of the
company for the full value of the property, less the sum which
the purchasers actually paid for a large lien claim and not for
the nominal amount, they having bought it at a large discount. Drury v. Cross, 7 Wall. 299; Jackson v. L-udeling, 21
Wall. 616.
It may be conceded for the purposes of this case, that the
stock in question could be paid for in work; but when the
rights of creditors intervene, the payment can only be made
in work at a reasonable price. The stockholder is not legally
entitled to a credit of $1000 on his stock when he only does
$500 worth of work. And as contracts to pay for stock in
work are frequefitly made to get the stock for nothing, or at

a fraud on bonafide stockholders and creditors of the corpora,

Mr.Walter C. .amed for appellee.
:MR. JuswcB IEAmr=, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
It is the settled doctrine of this court, as well as of the
Supreme Court of Missouri, that unpaid subscriptions to the
stock of a corporation constitute a trust fund for the benefit
of its creditors, which may not be given away or disposed of
by it, without consideration or fraudulently, to the prejudice
of such creditors. New Albany v Burke, 11 Wall. 96, 106;
Sawyer v. Hoag, 17 Wall. 610, 620; Upton, Assignee v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S. "45; Sanger v. Upton, Assignee, 91 U. S. 56;

G'reen, 133 U. S. 30, 45; Peters v. Bain, 133 U. S. 670, 691;
Clark v. Bever, ante, 96; Liebke v. Knapp, 79 Missouri, 22,
24. And this principle of general law is reinforced in Missoui'i
-where the transaction in question occurred, and by whose
laws the railroad corporations mentioned in the bill were
created -by a statute giving a judgment creditor of a corporation, where corporate property cannot be found upon
which to levy his execution, the right to an execution against
a stockholder "to the extenit of the amount of the unpaid
balance of such stock by him or her dwned." 1 IRev. Stats.
Missouri, 1879, p. 121, c. 21, § 736; Ib. 1889, § 2517.
While it was competent for the St. Louis, Hannibal and
Keokuk Railroad Company, exercising good faith, to use its
bonds and stock in payment for the construction of its road,
it could not rightfully, at least as against creditors or stock-

Opinion of the Court.

holders, issue its stock to Blair and Taylor as full paid without getting some fair or reasonable equivalent for it. What
was such an equivalent depends primarily upon the actual
value of the stock at the time it was contracted to be issued,
and upon the compensation which, under all the circumstances,
the contractors were equitably entitled to receive for the particular work undertaken or done by them. The principles
which, by established law, govern the relations between a corporation and its creditors and stockholders, and the management of the corporate property, would be of little value, if the
corporation, by its directors, could sell or dispose of its assets
to the prejudice of creditors and stockholders under such circumstances, on such terms and at such prices as indicated, upon
the face of the transaction, that they were being squandered
recklessly or fraudulently in disregard of the trust committed
to them. For such violations of trust the courts furnish ample
remedy, independently of any statute prescribing a special
mode for enforcing the liability of stockholders for the balance
due upon stock held by them purporting to be, but which is
not, full paid. Is the plaintiff entitled to relief under any
proper application of these principles ?
It is averred in the bill, and the demurrer admitted, for the
purposes of the hearing below, that full and adequate compensation for the work done by Blair and Taylor was $12,000
per mile in the company's first mortgage bonds. Assuming
this to be true, if the stock issued to Blair and Taylor was of
any considerable value at the time they received it, or if the
circumstances attending its delivery to them indicated bad
faith upon their part or upon the part of the corporation, dif
ferent questions would arise from thos6 now presented. But
the bill contains no allegation whatever as to the real or market value of the stock. The court cannot say, from any facts
set forth in the bill as to the condition of the railroads in
question that the stock when delivered to the contractors was
worth par, or that it had any substantial value. If, when disposed of by the railroad company, it was without value, no
wrong was done to creditors by the contract made with Blair
and Taylor. If the plaintiff expected to recover in this suit

FOGG v. BLAIR.
Opinion of the Court.

upon the ground that the stock was of substantial value, it was
incumbent upon him to distinctly allege facts that would enable
the court - assuming such facts to be true -

to say that the

contract between the railroad company and the contractors
was one which, in the interest of creditors, ought to be closely
scrutinized. He seems to have carefully avoided making any
allegation as to the real or probable value of the stock, and to
have supposed that the court, in the atsence of averment or
proof to the contrary, would assume that it was worth par, or
had substantial value. As he impugned the good faith of the
transaction between the company and the contractors, it was
incumbent upon him to state the essential, ultimate facts upon
which his cause of action rested, and not content himself with
charging, generally, that what was done was "colorable," a
"fraud," "a breach of trust," and a "scheme" by which Blair
and Taylor were to get the stock without paying for it. These
are allegations of legal conclusions merely, which a demurrer
does not admit. Dillon v. Barnard,21 Wall. 430, 437; United
States v. Ames, 99 U. S. 35, 45; Pullman Palace Car Co. v.
7iissouri Pacific Railway, 115 U. S. 587, 596; Ford v. Peering, 1 Ves. Jun. 72, 77. It is consistent with the allegations
of the bill that the stock was absolutely without value when
issued to Blair and up to the time when the railroad and all
the property appurtenant thereto was sold under the decree
of foreclosure. The demurrer was properly sustained.
