UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v.
GOODRIDGE.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLORADO.
No. 211. Argued April 14, 17, 1893. -Decided

May 15, 1893.

It is no proper business of a railway company as common carrier to foster
particular enterprises or to build up new industries, but, deriving its
franchises from the legislature, and depending upon the will of the
people for its very existence, it is bound to deal fairly with the public,
to extend them reasonable facilities for the transportation of their persons and property, and to put all its patrons upon an absolute equality.
It is no defence to an action against a railway company under the statute
of Colorado of 1885 to recover triple damages for an unjust discrimination in freights, to set up a contract for a rebate in case of furnishing
a certain amount for transportation, without also alleging and showing
that such an amount was furnished.
An unexplained, indefinite and unadjusted claim for damages arising from
a tort, which though put forward had never been pressed, is no defence
in such an action.
Sundry objections to testimony are held to be without merit.

THIS was an action at law by the firm of Goodridge &
Marfell, coal merchants, carrying on the business of mining
coal at Erie, Colorado, and of selling the same at Denver,
against the Umon Pacific Railway Company, to recover
triple damages, under a statute of Colorado, for an alleged
unjust discrimination m freights upon coal from Erie to
Denver.
The statute which was the basis of this action, together with
a corresponding clause of the state constitution of Colorado,
so far as the same are material to this case, are set forth in
the margin.'
lConstitution, Art. XV, Sec. 6 " All individuals, associations, and corporations shall have equal rights to have persons and property transported
over any railroad in this State, and no undue or unreasonable discrimination
shall be made in charges or in facilities for transportation of freight or

Statement of the Case.

The amended complaint alleged the defendant to be a common carrier, chartered by an act of Congress, and operating
a line of railroad from Erie and Marshall, at both of which
were located certain coal mines, about thirty-five miles, to
Denver, that, if there were any difference in distance, it was
in favor of Erie by about two miles, and that the published
passengers within the State, and no railroad company, nor any lessee,
manager, or employ6 thereof, shall give any preference to individuals,
associations, or corporations in furnishing cars or motive power."
Session Laws of Colorado, 1885, page 309 "Sec. 7. (Unjust discrimination.) No railroad corporation, shall, without the written approval of said
commissioner, charge, demand or receive from any person, company or corporation, for the transportation of persons or property or for any other
service, a greater sum than it shall, while operating under the classification
and schedule then in force, charge, demand or receive from any other person, company or corporation for a like service from the same place, or
upon like conditions and under similar circumstances, and all concessions
of rates, drawbacks and contracts for special rates shall be open to, and
allowed all persons, companies and corporations alike, at the same rate per
ton per mile, upon like conditions and under similar circumstances, except
in special cases designed to promote the development of the resources of
this State, when the approval of said commissioner shall be obtained ii
writing," &c.
"Sec. 8. (Extortion.) No railroad corporation shall charge, demand or
receive from any person, company or corporation an unreasonable price for
the transportation of persons or property, or for the handling or storing
of freight, or for the use of its cars, or for any privilege or service
afforded by it in the transaction of its business as a railroad corporation
and not specified in the classification and schedule prepared and published
by such railroad corporation. The superintendent or other chief executive
officer of each railroad in this State, shall cause to be kept posted up,. in
a conspicuous place ip the passenger depot in each station where passenger
tickets are kept for sale, a printed copy of the classification and schedule
of rates of freight charges then in force on each railroad, for the use of
the patrons of the road. Any railroad company violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of extortion, and be subject
to the penalties hereinafter described."
"Sec. 9. (Penalty.) Any railroad corporation that shall violate any of
the provisions of this act as to loading points, freight cars, unjust discrimination or extortion, shall forfeit, in every such case, to the person,
company or corporation aggrieved thereby, three times the actual damage
sustained or overcharges paid by the party aggrieved, which triple damages
shall be adjudged to be paid, together with the costs of suit and a reasonable
attorney's fee, to be fixed by the court and taxed with the costs."

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Statement of the Case.

schedule of freights for coal was the same, namely, one dollar
per ton from each place, that plaintiffs, while operating their
coal mines from Erie, between October 31, 1885, and August
12, 1887, shipped to Denver 12,960 tons and 1625 pounds of
coal, for which they paid defendant $12,960, and a fraction,
being at the rate of one dollar a ton, believing that such was
the regular schedule rate charged the general public and all
parties similarly situated for such service, there being no
difference or discrimination between such rates as between
Erie and -Marshall to Denver, that the M arshall Consolidated
Coal Miimng Company at the same time operated coal mines
at Marshall, and was engaged in shipping coal over defendant's road to Denver under the same circumstances as the
plaintiffs, except as to rates, and was a competitor with the
plaintiffs, that the amount of such shipments was about
145,833 tons, the defendant charging such company sxty
cents per ton, and allowing a rebate of forty cents from its
schedule rates, that plaintiffs are informed such rebates
amounted to upwards of $58,000, and that the defendant in
this manner, without the approval of the railroad commissioner, demanded and received from the plaintiffs the sum of
$5181.30 more than it received from the Marshall Consolidated
Coal Mining Company, (hereinafter called the Marshall Company,) for like services, upon like conditions and under simlar
circumstances, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs, that the defendant in this manner and to this extent
allowed the Marshall Company drawbacks or rebates for
carrying its coal which were not open to and allowed all
compames and corporations alike, at the same rate per ton
per mile, that these rebates were made secretly and clandestinely in favor of the Marshall Company, with the design to
deceive and mislead the plaintiffs and fraudulently conceal
from them the facts relating to such rebates, and did so conceal them until about August 12, 1887, and that the plaintiffs
were mislead and deceived by these devices and practices,
and remained in ignorance of the same until such date.
The plaintiffs further alleged that defendant had granted
other parties similarly situated the same rebates for the

Statement of the Case.
carrying of coal over its road from Marshall, and further
charged that all the coal shipped by the plaintiffs and the
Marshall Company was about the same quality, and cost the
defendant the same amount to handle and ship over its lines,
and that the charges made by the defendant were unreasonable, unjust, and extortionate, that plaintiffs had demanded
of defendant reimbursement of the overcharges which had
been refused, by reason of which they asked judgment in the
sum of $15,552.90, being three times the amount alleged to
have been extorted, at the rate of forty cents per ton on all
coal shipped by them.
The answer set up a general denial of each and every
material allegation in the complaint, and special denials that
defendant had allowed the Marshall Company a rebate of
forty cents per ton, or that it had charged plaintiffs more
than it had charged the Marshall Company for like services.
For a second defence, the defendant alleged that in January,
1880, the Denver, Western and Pacific Railway Company, a
Colorado corporation, was engaged in building a railroad
from Denver to Boulder, and in so doing passed over certain
coal lands belonging to one Langford and others, known as
the Marshall coal mine, that in constructing its line it
negligently broke into the mine, in consequence of which it
was claimed the mine took fire and destroyed large amounts
of coal, and continued to burn for several months, to recover
which damages suits were instituted by the owners of the
mine against the railroad company, which were litigated for
several years, that, in addition to such damages, the company
had failed to obtain a right of way across the mining lands,
that in January, 1882, a judgment was also obtained against
the company in the sum of $64,000 upon a mechanics' lien, of
which judgment the Union Pacific subsequently became the
owner, as well as of a large number of the bonds of the said
company, that the road was subsequently sold and came into
the hands of the Union Pacific, and, in 1885, a corporation
was formed under the name of Denver, Marshall and Boulder
Railway Company, which was owned and controlled by the
Union Pacific, and which proceeded to construct its road from

Statement of the Case.

Denver to Boulder, and that the claim against the Denver,
Western and Pacific had become and still remained a lien
upon the property in the hands of the Denver, Marshall and
Boulder Company That, in 1885, the said Langford and
others sold the Marshall coal mine to the Marshall Company,
which thus became the owner of the mine, and also, by
assignment, the owner of the claim for damages done to it by
the Denver, Western and Pacific Railway Company, that, in
1885, the Union Pacific was the owner of a certain coal mine
at or near Louisville, Boulder County, that, in addition to
the liens above stated, there was also a bonded indebtedness
of about one million dollars upon the Denver, Western and
Pacific, secured by a mortgage, which was foreclosed in 1883,
and upon such foreclosure the owners of the Marshall coal
mine answered, setting up their claim for damages to the
extent of $81,000. That the 'property was subsequently put
up and sold at master's sale under decree of foreclosure, the
rights of Langford and others not being adjudicated at that
time, and that upon such sale the title was acquired by parties
acting m behalf of the Union Pacific, which had become the
owner of a large number of the mortgage bonds. That for
some time prior to October 13, 1885, defendant was receiving
coal for its locomotives from the Union Coal Mining Company, which was the owner or lessee of certain coal mines at
Erie and at Louisville, and had been engaged in working the
mines and furnishing the defendant with coal, that about the
same time the Marshall Company had become the owner of
the coal lands formerly owned by Langford and others, and
that on account of complaints that had been made by the
owners of other mines, the defendant concluded that it was
for its best interest to discontinue its connection with the
Union Coal Company, and for that purpose it entered into
negotiations with the Marshall Company for the purpose of
inducing this company to take off its hands the mines of the
Union Coal Company That it was further induced to enter
into this contract by the fact that the Marshall Company had
succeeded to the rights of the former owners of the Marshall
coal mines, and to their claim for damages against the Denver,

Statement of the Case.

Western and Pacific, and for the purpose of getting rid of the
operation of the Union coal mines, and of settling this claim
for damages, it entered into a contract with the Marshall
Company on the 13th day of October, 1885, in which it was
recited that, it being for the interest of the Union Pacific to
discontinue the working of the Union coal mine, and to
contract with the Marshall Company for all the coal needed
for its own consumption on its road and branches, not to
exceed fifty thousand tons for the first year and one hundred
thousand tons for every year thereafter, therefore, in consideration of the Union Coal Company going out of the coal business, and the purchase from the Marshall Company by the
defendant of the coal used for its own consumption, at the
rate mentioned therein, and in consideration of the rates for
the transportation of coal therein agreed upon, the coal
company agreed to furnish from the Marshall mine all coal
ordered by the railway company for its own use and consumption, and the use of its branches, not exceeding fifty thousand
tons the first year and one hundred thousand tons per annum
thereafter, and to deliver all coal on board of the cars of the
Union Pacific at the mouth of the mine, at a price not to
exceed $1.25 per ton, delivered and loaded on the cars; and if
such cost was less than $1.25 per ton, then at actual cost.
It was further agreed that the defendant should give to
the Marshall Company for the transportation of its coal the
regular tariff rate, not exceeding one dollar per ton, unless
two hundred thousand tons should be mined and furnished
for transportation yearly, in which case a rate of sixty cents
per ton should be paid for all coal transported over defendanut's line to Denver, and if the rate were reduced below one
dollar, then the sixty cent rate should be reduced in the same
proportion. It was also provided that, if the railway company should order coal in excess of the amounts of fifty thousand and one hundred thousand tons per annum, then the
railroad company should pay the cost of mining and putting
such coal on the cars plus fifty cents per ton, except that in
no case should the price for mining and loading such coal
exceed $1.40 per ton, and it was further agreed that, as

part consideration of the contract, the majority of the
capital stock of such coal company should for two years be
held in case the company desired to sell it, and should first be
offered to the Union Pacific in preference to any other
purchaser. This contract was to remain m force for five
years.
It was further alleged that, from the fact that Mr. Adams,
the president of the defendant company, was not intimately
acquainted with the claim for damages made by the former
owners of the Marshall mines, the contract failed to mention
anything about the settlement of said claim, but that the
contract was sent to the general attorney of the defendant,
with instructions to look it over, and if anything further was
needed to settle the controversy that might grow out of anything theretofore existing it should be provided for m a
separate instrument, and thereupon the attorney prepared
a bond of indemnity for execution by the coal company,
reciting the claim for damages against the Denver, Western
and Pacific, and agreeing to indemnify the railway company
against any damages which might accrue to it by reason of
such claim, and upon the execution of such bond, and as part
of the transaction, the contract was delivered to the Marshall
Company, and afterwards the former owners of said Marshall
mines executed -and delivered a receipt in full, discharging
the defendant from all suits and causes of action existing by
reason of any matter or thing pertaining to the construction
of the Denver, Western and Pacific Railway Company The
answer further alleged that the defendant was informed and
believed that it cost the Marshall Company, and would have
cost the defendant if it had continued to operate through the
Union Coal Company, at least $1.60 per ton to mine their
coal, and that, on account of the settlement of the aforesaid
claims, and of the coal necessarily used by it, the Marshall
Company has paid the defendant a higher rate as a matter of
fact than one dollar per ton, although it was not intended
that the rate should exceed the schedule price.
To this second defence, which was elaborately set forth
in the answer, a demurrer was interposed by the plaintiffs,

and sustained by the court, (37 Fed. Rep. 182,) to which the
defendant duly excepted. Defendant thereupon for a third
defence pleaded the statute of limitations, plaintiffs replied,
and the case went to trial before a jury, which returned a
verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $5184.30, for which
amount judgment was entered, and defendant sued out this

M]n. JUSTIcE BRowN, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
This case involves the construction of an act of the legislature of Colorado passed in 1885, prohibiting railroads from
charging one person or corporation a greater sum than it
charges any other, for a like service upon like conditions and
under similar circumstances. The statute is of the same
nature as the Interstate Commerce Act, and like that was
designed to prevent unjust discrimination and extortion in
rates for the carriage of persons and property
1. The first assignment of error is taken to the ruling of
the court sustaining the demurrer to the second answer of the
defendant, in which it set up certain contracts with the
Marshall Consolidated Coal Company, which were claimed to
justify the rebate of forty cents per ton allowed to that company from the regular schedule rates, which the plaintiffs
were compelled to pay This defence set forth a very complicated series of facts, which, however, are susceptible of a
condensed statement. It seems that the defendant, the Union

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

Pacific, was the owner of a large part of the capital stock of
the Union Coal Company, and had been for some time receiving from it coal for consumption upon its locomotives, when,
on account of certain complaints made by the owners of other
mines, it concluded that it was for its best interests to discontinue its connection with this company, and to enter into
negotiations with the Marshall Company for its supply of
coal. These negotiations resulted in the contract of October
13, 1885, wherein the coal company agreed on its part, first,
to furmsh the railroad with all coal needed for its consumption, not exceeding fifty thousand tons the first year- and one
hundred thousand tons yearly thereafter, and to deliver the
same on its cars at the mouth of the mine at cost, but m no
case to exceed $1.25 per ton, second, that, in case the railroad
should order in excess of the above amount, the same should
be furnished at cost, plus fifty cents per ton, but in no case
should such cost exceed $1.40 per ton, third, that the railroad company should have the option for two years of taking
a majority of the capital stock of the coal company in preference to any other purchaser, should the coal company desire
to sell the same.
The railway company, upon its part, agreed to go out of
the business of mining coal, and to give the coal company the
regular tariff rate to Denver of $1 per ton, unless two hundred
thousand tons were furnushed for transportatwneach year, in
which case a rebate of forty cents should be given, with a
corresponding reduction in case the regular tariff was reduced
below $1.
There were other subordinate covenants upon both sides,
but they are not material to the consideration of this case.
This contract was to remain in force for five years.
It is a sufficient reply to the whole defence set up in this part
of the answer to say that the coal company was only to be
allowed a rebate of forty cents per ton in case it furnished
the railroad company two hundred thousand tons per year for
transportation, and there is no allegation in the answer that it
ever did furnish this amount, or ever became entitled to the
rebate. The want of such allegation is fatal to the contract

UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY v. GOODRIDGE.

689

Opinion of the Court.

as a defence, and the court for this reason, if for no other,
was right in sustaining the demurrer.
But we think the answer must be held insufficient for
another reason. It is further stated that an additional consideration existed for this rebate in certain unliquidated claims
for damages which the former owners of the Marshall mines
had against the Denver, Western and Pacific Railway Company, the original constructors of the road, by reason of their
negligently breaking into the mine during the construction of
the road, setting it on fire, and thereby consuming a large
amount of coal and personal property, for which claim suits
were instituted against the railway company and litigated at
great expense for several years, and were still undetermined.
There was also another claim for a right of way for one mile
across their lands. These claims, Langford and others, who
then owned the mane, sold and assigned to the Marshall Company with the property The Denver, Western and Pacific
Railway, which had done the injury for which the damages
were claimed, was itself sold under foreclosure of its mortgage,
and bought in by parties acting in the interest of the Union
Pacific, who orgamzed a new corporation, called the Denver,
Marshall and Boulder Railway, leaving the claim of the M arshall Coal Company unadjusted and unpaid, and a lien upon
the property How this claim for unliquidated damages for
the negligence of the railroad company became a lien
upon the property of the company, and how such lien took precedence of the mortgage and survived the foreclosure and sale
of the property, and became a lien upon the road in the hands
of the Denver, Marshall and Boulder Company, does not
clearly appear, but admitting it to be still valid and outstanding, as alleged in the answer, the question still remains
whether the defendant company can set up an unliquidated
claim of this kind in defence of a rebate of forty cents per ton
allowed the coal company over every other shipper on its
road.
It will be observed m this connection that not only was the
amount of the damages suffered by the coal company never
fixed, agreed upon, or adjusted, but the amount of coal which
voL. cxLI--44

Opinion of the Court.

the Marshall Company was at liberty to deliver to the railroad
company for transportation was left equally indefinite, save
only that it must exceed two hundred thousand tons per year
to entitle it to the rebate. This contract was to remain in
force five years, but upon the theory of the defendant there
was nothing to prevent it being continued indefinitely, provided the defendant company was willing to accede to any
amount of damages which the coal company might see fit to
claim. While we do not undertake to say that a railroad
company may not justify a fixed rebate in favor of a particular shipper by showing a liquidated indebtedness to such
shipper, which the allowance of the rebate was intended to
settle, it would practically emasculate the law of its most
healthful feature, to permit an unexplained, indefinite, and
unadjusted claim for damages arising from a tort, which,
though litigated for some time, never seems to have been
prosecuted to a final determination m the courts, to be put
forward as an excuse for a clear discrimination in rates.
This act was intended to apply to intrastate traffic the same
wholesome rules and regulations which Congress two years
thereafter applied to commerce between the States, and to cut
up by the roots the entire system of rebates and discriminations in favor of particular localities, special enterprises, or
favored corporations, and to put all shippers on an absolute
equality, saving only a power, not in the railroad company
itself, but in the railroad commissioner. to except "special
cases designed to promote the development of the resources
of this State," and not to prevent the commissioner "from
making a lower rate per ton per mile, in carload lots, than
shall govern shipments in less quantities than carload lots, and
from making lower rates for lots of less than five carloads
than for single carload lots." The statute recognizes the fact
that it is no proper business of a common carrier to foster particular enterprises or to build up new industries, but, deriving
its franchise from the legislature, and depending upon the will
of the people for its very existence, it is bound to deal fairly
with the public, to extend them reasonable facilities for tue
transportation of their persons and property, and to put all its

patrons upon an absolute equality Scofeld v Railway, 43
Ohio St. 571, Sanford v Railroad,24: Penn. St. 378, Messenger v Pennsyvanta Railroad,7 Vroom, (36 N. J Law,)
407, .cD'iffe v Portland &c. Railroad,52 N. El. 430. So
opposed is the policy of the act to secret rebates of this
description, that it requires a printed copy of the classification
and schedule of rates to be posted conspicuously in each passenger station for the use of the patrons of the road, that every
one may be apprised, not only of what the company will exact
of him for a particular service, but what it exacts of every one
else for the same service, so that in fixing his own prices he
may know precisely with what he has to compete. To hold
a defence thus pleaded to be valid would open the door to the
grossest frauds upon the law, and practically enable the railroad company to avail itself of any consideration for a rebate
which it considers sufficient, and to agree with the favored
customer upon some fabricated claim for damages, which it
would be difficult, if not impossible, to disprove. For instance,
under the defence made by this company, there is nothing to
prevent a customer of the road, who has received a personal
injury, from making a claim against the road for any amount
he chooses, and in consideration thereof, and of shipping all
his goods by that road, receiving a rebate for all goods lie
may ship over the road for an indefinite time in the future.
It is almost needless to say that such a contract could not be
supported.
There is no doubt of the general proposition that the release
of an unliquidated claim for damages is a good consideration
for a promise, as between the parties, and if no one else were
interested in the transaction, that rule might apply here, but
the legislature, upon grounds of public policy, and for the
protection of third parties, has made certain requirements with
regard to equality of rates, which m their practical application
would be rendered nugatory, if this rule were given full effect.
For this reason we think the railroad company is in error m
its assumption that "if, in the honest judgment of the officers
of the defendant company, who made the contract, the considerations which entered into it, and upon which alone it was

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

made, were sufficient to warrant the company to pay back to
the Marshall Company forty cents per ton for each ton it
shipped for five years, that is enough." This is but a restatement in different language of a comment made by the court
below in its opinion, that "the whole answer amounts only to
this That the Marshall Company is allowed less rates than
other shippers are required to pay upon considerations which
are satisfactory to defendant, and it is obvious that this is no
answer to a complaint of unlawful discrimination." If reasons
of public policy dictate that the schedule rates shall be posted
conspicuously in each railway station, it is no less important
that the customers of the road should have the means of
ascertaining whether any departure from such rates in favor
of a particular shipper is justified by the facts. Such a
method is contemplated by the act, in providing that no discrimination of this kind shall be made without the written
approval of the railway commissioner. It was evidently
designed to put it in the power of the commissioner to
permit such discrimination to be made, possibly in a case like
the present one, if, in his opinion, the circumstances seem to
warrant it.
2. The second assignment of error is taken to the admission of certain letters of Taggart and Kimball.
Upon the trial of the case before a jury, the plaintiffs gave
evidence tending to show that the Jackson Coal Company
was operating mines at Canfield, thirty-six miles from Denver,
and was charged by defendant $1 per ton for transportation,
and that another railroad company, which ran across the
mine, charged the same rate. There was also testimony
showing the amount shipped by plaintiffs over defendant's
road to have been 12,961 tons, for which they paid $1 per
ton. Plaintiffs thereupon called E. R. Taggart, who resided
in Denver, and had been engaged in the coal trade for several
years, selling the product of the Fox Coal Company, which
shipped its coal at the same station as the Marshall Company,
and was charged $1, and who testified that upon information
received by him of the rebate allowed to the Marshall Company through the proceedings of a commission appointed to

UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY v. GOODRIDGE.

693

Opmlon of the Court.

investigate the affair, he wrote to the president of the defendant, and also to T. L. Kimball, the general traffic manager
and official head of the defendant company The letter to
Kimball, with the reply, was objected to upon the ground that
the demurrer to the second answer having been sustained, any
statement of the way in which the defendant acted relating
to that defence was immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent,
which objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. The
letter from Kimball to the witness Taggart purported to be a
reply to a letter from Taggart to the president of the road,
and stated generally that the contract with the Marshall Company was made under circumstances entirely dissimilar to
those existing between the Fox Company and the Union
Pacific, and in consideration of the company's furnishing
the railroad coal for its own use at not exceeding $1.25 per
ton, and also in compromise and settlement of a claim against
the company for some sixty-odd thousand dollars. Taggart's
reply thereto, dated August 20, 1887, stated the claim from
his standpoint, and that he had been advised by the very
highest legal sources that the contract was without warrant
and clearly in violation of law, and further insisted upon his
claim for the repayment of forty cents per ton. If there
were any objection to the admission of Kimball's letter upon
the ground that the letter to which it was a reply was not
produced, that objection was met by the production of that
letter upon cross-examination - a letter which appears to have
been written July 25, 1887, to Mr. Adams, president of the
road, at Boston. The witness stood in the same position as
the plaintiffs with respect to defendant, and had also brought
suit against it to recover the same rebate which) had been
allowed to the Marshall Company, and which plaintiffs were
suing to recover m this case. Assuming the correspondence
to have been between different parties, and therefore irrelevant, it is not easy to perceive how it could have prejudiced
the defendant, as Kimball's letter was a mere iteration of the
defence set up in the answer, and put forward at the trial, and
Taggart's reply thereto, if irrelevant, was not improper or
prejudicial to the defendant. If the witness had had an oral

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

conversation with Mr. Kimball, the manager of the defendant
company, there can be no doubt that such conversation, and
the whole of it, would have been admissible, as both Taggart's
claim and defendant's stood precisely upon the same footing,
and if this demand and refusal, instead of being oral, was by
correspondence, it would seem equally admissible. As Kimball's letter stated clearly the position of the defendant with
regard to both these claims, it is difficult to see how it could
be prejudiced by its production.
3. The third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are
taken upon the same ground to the action of the court in refusing to allow the witnesses Taggart and Rubridge to testify
as to what it cost to get out coal and put in on the cars at the
Marshall mine, and in ruling out testimony showing that by
-reason of such cost the Marshall Company actually paid at
least $1 per ton for coal carried by defendant.
At the time witness Taggart was asked this question, the
case stood in this position A demurrer to the second answer
of the defendant setting up its excuses for the rebate had
been sustained, and the case set for trial upon the complaint
and the denials -in other words, upon the general issue.
Plaintiffs had shown that they, as well as the Jackson and
Fox Coal Company, had paid $1 per ton, and had shown the
rebate paid to the M arshall Company, but the contract had
not been put m evidence, though the witness Taggart had
sworn that he knew "that defendant set up in bar of plaintiffs' clain a contract they had with the Marshall Company
in consideration of the Marshall Company supplying them
with coal at a given price -much below the price at which
they coul, mine it or get it out of the mines - and, further,
in settlement of an old law suit they had," and the record
then states in a very blind way that "the witness gave

every ton of coal than what it cost." Defendant's counsel
here asked "As a matter of fact, do you know what it did
cost to get out a ton of coal and put it on cars at the MYarshall or Fox nne 2" Tns was clearly immaterial, as it was
no excuse for a rebate that the coal cost more or less. The
right of a railroad to charge a certain sum for freight does
not depend at all upon the fact whether its customers are
making or losing by their business.
The next witness, Robert H. Rubridge, who had been the
treasurer and assistant secretary of the Marshall Company,
testified that from November 1, 1885, to August 1, 1887,
there was shipped from the Marshall mine to Denver 67,863
tons, upon which a rebate of forty cents per ton was allowed.
Upon cross-examination he testified that that rebate was
allowed in consideration "of our giving an indemnity bond.
Our company gave an indemnity bond protecting the Union
Pacific from all claims on account of a damage suit against
them, amounting to about $65,000, for which they had
attachments on some of the rolling stock and ties and half a
mile of track of the Denver, Western and Pacific.
We were to give them coal at cost for the company's use,
but not to exceed at any time $1.25 per ton, and also to give
them coal for commercial use at not exceeding $1.40 per ton,
that is,for Kansas but not for Denver." This oral testimony
with regard to the contract was objected to by plaintiffs'
counsel on the ground that the written contract should be
produced, an objection which was overruled by the court.
There was evidently an attempt here to obtain from the
witness a statement of so much of the contract as was favorable to the defendant, and at the same tune not to put it in
evidence, since the contract would show on its face that the
coal company was not entitled to any rebate, unless it furnished the railroad company two hundred thousand tons per
annum for transportation, a far larger amount than it did
actually furnish. It further appeared that the contract, establishing the price of the coal, was not lived up to, as the railroad company was paying anywhere from $1.25 to $1.75 per
ton. The witness was then asked how much it cost to get

out coal, and to put it on the cars for the use of the Union
Pacffic in its engines, and also for its commercial use m
Kansas.
The answer to this question, as well as the proposal of the
defendant to show by the witness that the cost of getting
out the coal, which they were obliged to furnish the Union
Pacific under the contract, was largely in excess of what they
got, was properly ruled out. The relations between the defendant and the Marshall Company were fixed by their written contract, and under that contract the railway company
was entitled to a certain amount of coal at $1.25 per ton regardless of cost, and the Marshall Company was not entitled
to a rebate unless they furnished 200,000 tons per annum for
shipment. This testimony could only have been offered to
show that the company was losing money in furnishing the
coal at $1.25 per ton, and, therefore, that the discrimnation in
their favor by the railroad company was not unjust. But the
court, having sustained the demurrer to the answer setting
up this contract upon the ground that it constituted no defence, could not consistently have permitted the defendant to
introduce oral testimony of such contract for the purpose of
enabling it to rely upon such stipulations as were thought to
be favorable to itself. The witness had stated, in answer to
the question why the rebate of 40 cents per ton was allowed,
that the consideration for doing this was in writing. Plaintiffs' counsel thereupon objected to the proposed oral evidence
of the contract as incompetent, and while this objection,
though it seems to us to have been well taken, was not sustained, and the witness was permitted to give certain of its
stipulations, the court was at liberty at any time to put a stop
to this character of testimony, or to rule out any further questions based upon it. The whole case virtually turned upon the
demurrer to that portion of the answer setting up this contract. This demurrer having been sustained, the defendant
should not have been allowed in this indirect way to obtain
the advantage of certain stipulations included m the contract.
4. The sixth assignment, that the court erred in refusing to

receive in evidence the release of the Marshall Company to
the defendant company, cannot be sustained for the same reason. This release, a copy of which is given in the record, was
given by the Marshall Coal Mining Company, and by Langford and Marshall, the previous owners of the mine, to the
defendant railway company, releasing it from "all actions and
causes of action, suits, controversies, claims, and demands whatsoever for or by reason of any cause, matter, or thing arising
out of the construction of any railroad across the property of
either of us in Boulder and Jefferson Counties, Colorado." It
is obvious, upon the principles hereinbefore stated, that this
release was altogether too vague and general to serve as a
basis for making the rebate to the Marshall Company
After some other testimony as to prices paid by other companies, and of unsuccessful efforts made to ascertain why the
Marshall Company was given lower rates than its competitors,
the plaintiffs rested: The defendant put in no testimony, and
the case was committed to the jury, who returned a verdict
for $5481.34.
5. The seventh and last assignment of error was to the
action of the court in refusing to grant a new trial, and in
entering a judgment on the verdict, because there was no
sufficient evidence to support the verdict, and especially to
sustain it as to the amount of damages. Plaintiffs' evidence
had shown that the Marshall Company had been receiving a
rebate upon all coal transported by it to Denver, which was
not allowed to its competitors in business, and the damages
sustained by the plaintiffs were measured by the amount of
such rebate, which should have been allowed to them. The
question whether they lost profits upon the sale of their coal
by reason of the non-allowance of such rebates was too remote
to be made an element of their damages. They were entitled
to the same terms which the M arshall Company would have
received, and damages to the exact extent to which the Marshall Company was given a preference.
There was no error in the action of the court below, and its
judgment is, therefore,
Affirmed.
