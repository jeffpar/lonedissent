JUSTICE

Gr.Y delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a suit, brought November 1, 1888, in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, under
the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, by Nicholas S. Hill, a citizen
of Maryland, against the United States, for the use and occupation of land for a light-house.
The petition alleged that the plaintiff, since February 14,
1873, had been seized and possessed in fee simple of certain

tracts of land in Baltimore County in the State of Maryland,
fronting upon Chesapeake Bay, (as shown upon a plat, and
specifically described in a deed of that date to him from
Thomas Donaldson, copies of both of which were annexed to
the petition,) "with all the riparian rights attached thereto
under the law of this State," that, since his acquisition of
said land and rights, "a valuable part thereof has been used
and occupied by the United States government" for " the erection and maintenance of a light-house, known generally as
the Miller's Island light-house," "without any compensation
to your petitioner for such use and occupation, and without
the consent thereto of your petitioner or his predecessors in
title;" and that "by the use and occupancy by the government as aforesaid of his property he has been prevented from
using the same within the limits above mentioned, and from
erecting buildings thereupon, and using the same for fishing
and gunning purposes." The plaintiff "claims, as damages
for the use and occupation of his said property as aforesaid,
the sum of $9999 from November 1, 1885, until November 1,
1888, and prays the judgment and decree of this honorable
court thereupon on the facts and the law"
The United States pleaded three pleas
1. A former judgment. The plaintiff replied that there
was no such judgment, and the United States joined issue on
the replication.
2. "That the land referred to and described in the petition
filed in this cause is submerged land and part of the bottom
of the Chesapeake Bay, one of the navigable waters of the
United States, and that the said defendant, under the law, for
the purposes of a light-house, has a paramount right to its use
as against the plaintiff or any other person." To this plea the
plaintiff demurred.
3. "That the defendant did not commit the wrongs alleged."
The plaintiff joined issue on this plea.
On June 22, 1889, the Circuit Court overruled the demurrer
to the second plea, and gave judgment thereon for the United
States, with costs, and filed a written opinion, which is published in 39 Fed. Rep. 172.

HILL v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court

On June 27, 1889, the Circuit Judge filed findings of facts
and conclusions of law, which are copied in the margin.'
I FDnm Gs OF F.ACTS.
1. I find that copies of the plaintiff's petition were, in compliance with
the requirements of the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, duly served on the
United States district attorney and the Attorney General of the United
States, and said law in all respects complied with.
2. I find that the plaintiff, since February 14, 1873, has been seized and
possessed in fee simple of the tract of land described in these proceedings,
and known as Miller's Island, and of all the riparian rights attached thereto
under the laws of the State of Maryland.
3. I find that no part of the fast land included in the deed of the plaintiff has been used or occupied by the United States but that a site for the
rear range light of Craighill channel, situated about two hundred yards from
the shore line of the plaintifi s land, has been occupied and used by the
United States; that the said site is submerged land in the Chesapeake Bay,
one of the public navigable waters of the United States, and within the ebb
and flow of the tide, and in water about two feet deep at low tide.
4. I find that Craighill channel is a channel in Chesapeake Bay, constructed by the United States, and used by ocean vessels in their approach
to the port of Baltimore; and that the light-house constructed by the United
States in the year 1874 on the site in question is an important and necessary
aid to the navigation of said channel.
5. I find that the United States took possession of said site for the purpose of building the light-house in question, without condemnation, or the
payment of any compensation to the plaintiff or any other person, in the
year 1874.
6. I find that the land of Miller's Island, belonging to the plaintiff, was
heretofore used and is chiefly valuable on account of the gunning for geese,
swan and ducks, and for the fishing privileges with nets; and that since the
erection of the light-house adjoining the shore the value of the land has
decreased greatly, and that the plaintiff's testimony tended to show that said
decrease is due to the erection of said light-house, and that the island formerly rented for $3000 per annum, but since the erection of the light-house
the rent has decreased to $500 per annum.

That the legal title to the site of the light-house in question is in the State

Opinion of the Court.

The act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, ยง 7, provides that " it shall
be the duty of the court to cause a written opinion to be filed
in the cause, setting forth the specific findings by the court of
the facts therein, and the conclusions of the court upon all
questions of law involved in the case, and to render judgment
thereon. If the suit be in equity or admiralty, the court shall
proceed with the same according to the rules of such courts."
241 Stat. 506. But, in the case at bar, the only judgment
entered, and upon which this writ of error was sued out,
appears to have been given for the United States on the
plaintiff's demurrer to the second plea, which presented an
issue of law only, upon which the findings of fact can have no
possible bearing or effect. It would seem to follow that the
findings of facts cannot be taken into consideration by this
court upon this record. But this is comparatively unimportant,
because those findings do but state in greater detail the facts
alleged and admitted by the petition, the second plea and the
demurrer to that plea.
The land in question, upon which the United States have
built and maintain a light-house, is below low water mark,
and under the tide waters of Chesapeake Bay Both parties
assume that by the common law of England, which was the
common law of Maryland, the title in land below high water
mark of tide waters was in the King, and upon the Declaration of Independence passed to the State of Maryland, and
remained in the State after the adoption of the Constitution
of the United States, except so far as any right in such land
was surrendered to the United States by virtue of the grant
to Congress of the power to regulate commerce with foreign
nations and among the several States, including as a necessary
and occupy the site in question for the purposes of commerce, which includes navigation, without condemnation or compensation, the submerged
land forming the site of the light-house being, as to such a use by the
United States, public and not private property.
I therefore overrule the demurrer of the plaintiff to the second plea of
the United States, and I do give judgment under said plea for the United
States, with costs, to include what has been actually incurred for witnesses and for summoning the same, and fees paid to the clerk of the

court.

Opinion of the Court.

incident the exclusive right to regulate and control the building and maintenance of light-houses for the protection of navigation, and except, also, so far as any right on such lands
has been lawfully granted by the State of Maryland to
private persons.
By the statute of Maryland of 1862, c. 129, article 54 of the
Public General Laws of the State was amended by adding the
followings sections
SEC. 37. "The proprietor of land bounding on any of the
navigable waters of this State is hereby declared to be entitled
to all accretions to said land by the recession of said water,
whether heretofore or hereafter formed or made, by natural
causes or otherwise, in like manner and to like extent assuch
right may or can be claimed by the proprietor of land bounding on water not navigable."
SEC. 38. "The proprietor of land bounding on any of the
navigable waters of this State is hereby declared to be entitled
to the exclusive right of making improvements into the waters
in front of his said land, such improvements, and other
accretions as above provided for, shall pass to the successive
owners of the land to which they are attached,, as incident to
their respective estates. But no such improvement shall be so
made as to interfere with the navigation of the stream of
water into which the said improvement is made."
SEC. 39. "No patent hereafter issued out of the land office
shall impair or affect the rights of riparian proprietors, as
explained and declared in the two sections next preceding this
section, and no patent shall hereafter issue for land covered by
navigable waters."
The plaintiff contends that the entire title in the land below
high tide, with the right to improve and build upon the same,
remained in the State after the adoption of the Constitution,
that, by the statute of 1862, the title to such land, at the place
in question, or at least the exclusive right of building thereon,
was vested in the plaintiff, and that the title or right so
acquired by him was his private property, which, by the Fifth
Amendment of the Constitution, could not be taken by the
United States for the erection and maintenance of a light-house
for the public use, without just compensation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

The United States, on the other hand, assert, and the court
below has held, that the United States upon the adoption of
the Constitution acquired the paramount right to the use of
this submerged land for a light-house, without making any
compensation therefor, and that any title or right conferred
on the plaintiff by the subsequent statute of the State was
necessarily subject to this paramount right of the United
States.
The question thus presented is of such importance to the
United States, as well as to owners of lands bounding on tide
waters, that it becomes this court, before expressing any
opinion upon it, to inquire whether the courts have jurisdiction
to determine the question in this form of proceeding against
the United States.
The whole effect of the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, under
which this suit was brought, was to give the Circuit and
District Courts of the United States jurisdiction, concurrently
with the Court of Claims, of suits to recover damages against
the United States, in cases not sounding in tort. Unbted
States v Jones, 131 U. S. 1, 16, 18.
The United States cannot be sued in their own courts without their consent, and have never permitted themselves to be
sued in any court for torts committed in their name by their
officers. Nor can the settled distinction, in this respect, between contract and tort, be evaded by framing the claim as
upon an implied contract. Gibbons v Uted States, 8 Wall.
269, 274, -Langfordv United States, 101 U S. 341, 346,
Unizted States v Jones, above cited.
An action in the nature of assumpsit for the use and occupation of real estate will never lie where there has been no
relation of contract between the parties, and where the possession has been acquired and maintained under a different or
adverse title, or where it is tortious and makes the defendant
a trespasser. Lloyd v Hough, 1 How 153,159, Carpenterv
United States, 17 Wall. 489, 493.

longed to -the government, the United States could not be
charged upon an implied obligation to pay for its use and
occupation.
It has since been held that if the United States appropriate
to a public use land which they admit to be private property,
they may be held, as upon an implied contract, to pay its value
to the owner. United States v Great Falls Afanuf Co., 112
U. S. 645, and 124 U. S. 581. It has likewise been held that
the United States may be sued in the Court of Claims for the
use of a patent for an invention, the plaintiff's right in which
they have acknowledged. Hollister v Benedict .Manuf Co.,
113 U. S. 59, Unsted States v Palmer,128 U. S.262. But
m each of these cases the title of the plaintiff was admitted,
and in none of them was any doubt thrown upon the correctness of the decision in Langford's case. See Schillinger v.
United States, 24 C. Cl. 278.
The case at bar is governed by Langford's case. It was
not alleged in this petition, nor admitted in the plea, that the
United States had ever in any way acknowledged any right
of property in the plaintiff as against the United States. The
plaintiff asserted a title in the land in question, with the
exclusive right of building thereon, and claimed damages of
the United States for the use and occupation of the land for a
light-house. The United States positively and precisely
pleaded that the land was submerged under the waters of
Chesapeake Bay, one of the navigable waters of the United
States, and that the United States, "under the law, for the
purpose of a light-house, has a paramount right to its use as
against the plaintiff or any other person", and the plaintiff
demurred to this plea. The Circuit Court, instead of rendering
judgment for the United States upon the demurrer, should
have dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction.

dissenting.

When the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States declares that "private property shall not be
taken for public use without just compensation," a compact
or contract of the highest degree of obligation is thereby
established between the American people of the one part and
each and every citizen of the other part. In and by that constitutional provision every citizen agrees that his property may
be taken for public use whenever the nation, through its legislative department, demands it, and the United States agree
that, when the property of the citizen is so taken, just compensation shall be made.
Whenever a case arises, m which that constitutional provision is invoked, two questions present themselves first, is
the property dealt with the private property of the party
claiming it? and, secondly, has it been taken by the United
States for public use 2
If the property to be affected is not that of the claimant, of
course his appeal to the constitutional protection will be yam.
But it is equally plain that the question of title is not one to
be decided by the party claimant, or by the legislative or
executive departments of the United States. That is a judicial question. Accordingly, if in a given case it is either admitted, or proposed to be shown, that the property concerned
belongs to a party before a court having jurisdiction to deal
with the subject, then the only question that remains is
whether such property has been taken by the United States
for public use. In such a case the United States cannot, by
a plea denying the plaintiff's title, make it the duty of the
court to dismiss the plaintiff's suit. Such a denial cannot be
treated, in face of the constitutional compact, as an exercise
of sovereign power, whereby the right of the citizen to assert
his property rights is forbidden, but it merely raises a judicial
issue, to be determined by the court.
If the court shall determine that the property in question is
the private property of the claimant, then the second question
comes up, whether the United States have taken it for public use.

HILL v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion. Shlms,

.

If it shall appear that, in point of fact, the United States
have not taken the plaintiff's property for public use, and that
all that the plaintiff has to complain of is that some persons,
known or unknown, but claiming to be officers or agents of
the United States, have committed a trespass upon his property, and it does not appear that the acts complained of were
in pursuance of any law of the United States, or that they
have been ratified by the United States, by taking possession
of and occupying the property for public use, then the plaintiff's case will fall within the doctrine of Langford v. Un'ted
Btates, 101 U. S. 341, and must be treated as an attempt, under
the assumption of an implied contract, to make the government responsible for the unauthorized acts of its officers, those
acts being themselves torts.
Biit if it shall be shown, or be admitted, that the United
States, by law, either authorized their agents to appropriate
the property of the plaintiff, or have ratified the action of
their agents by taking possession of the property and subjecting it to public use, then the constitutional duty of the court
is to pronounce judgment for the plaintiff, and to award him
just compensation.
These views do not overlook the well-settled doctrine that
unless and until Congress shall, by adequate legislation, provide a legal remedy, private rights against the government
may be in abeyance. But when Congress, in obedience to
the behest of the Constitution, has provided such a remedy,
then there is no legal obstacle to the plaintiff's recovery
That Congress has provided such a remedy is seen m the act
of March 3, 1887, c. 359, whereby it is enacted that the Court
of Claims, and, concurrently, the District and Circuit Courts of
the United States, "shall have jurisdiction to hear and deternune all clarms founded upon the Constitution of the United
States or any law of Congress, except for pensions, or upon
any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United
States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not
sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would
be entitled to redress against the United States either in a

court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were

suable."
This legislation perhaps originated m the regret expressed
by this court m Langford's case, that "Congress has made no
provision by general law for ascertaining and paying this just
compensation." That was a suit brought m the Court of
Claims, under section 1059 of the Revised Statutes, in which
there is no remedy provided for claims founded upon the
Constitution of the United States, and was, m the language of
the court, the case of "an unequivocal tort."
The later case of Unzted States v Great Falls Manufacturing Co., 112 U S. 645, 656, is, m some respects, like the
present one. It was there held that it was clear "that these
property rights have been held and used by the agents of the
United States, under the sanction of legislative enactments by
Congress, for the appropriation of money specifically for the
construction of the dam from the Maryland shore to Conn's
Island was, all the circumstances considered, equivalent to an
express direction by the legislative and executive branches of
the government to take this particular property for the public
objects contemplated by the scheme for supplying the capital
of the nation with wholesome water. The making of the
improvements necessarily involves the taking of the property,
and if, for the want of formal proceedings for its condemnation to public use, the claimant was entitled, at the beginning
of the work, to have the agents of the government enjoined
from prosecuting it until provision was made for securing, in
some way, payment of the compensation required by the
Constitution - upon which question we express no opinion there is no sound reason why the claimant might not waive
that right, and, electing to regard the action of the government as a taking under its sovereign right of ancient domain,
demand just compensation. In that view we are of opinion
that the United States, having by their agents, proceeding
under the authority of an act of Congress, taken the property
of the claimant for public use, are under an obligation imposed by the Constitution to make compensation. The law
will imply a promise to make the required compensation

BILL v. UNITED STATES.

where property, to which the government asserts no title, is
taken pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to
be applied for public use. Such an implication being consistent with the constitutional duty of the government, as well
as with common justice, the claimant's cause of action is one
that arises out of inplied contract, within the meaning of the
statute which confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims of
actions founded Iupon any contract, express or implied, with
the government of the United States."'
Having distinguished the case from that of angford the
court proceeded to say "In such a case it is difficult to perceive why the legal obligation of the United States to pay
for what was thus taken pursuant to an act of Congress is not
quite as strong as it would have been had formal proceedings
for condemnation been resorted to for that purpose. If the
claimant makes no objection to the particular mode in which
the property has been taken, but substantially demes it, by
asserting, as is done in the petition in this case, that the
government took the property for the public uses designated,
we do not perceive that the court is under any duty to make
the objection m order to relieve the United States from the
obligation to make just compensation."
It will be noticed that this decision, m terms so applicable
to the present case,'was made before the act of March 3, 1887,
in which, for the first tine, an express remedy was given for
"1all claims founded upon the Constitution of the United
States," and m "respect to claims for which the party would
be entitled to redress against the United States, either m a
court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were
suable."
In the present case, although no express proceedings have
been instituted by the United States to condemn the property
for public use, yet it is admitted in the pleas that the United
States have taken possession of it for a public use or purpose,
and by various acts of Congress, of which we can take judicial
notice, large sums of money have been granted to construct
and maintain the light-house on the site in question.
The opinon of the court seeks to withdraw the case from

the operation of the Constitution and the act of 1887, and to
bring it within the decision of the Lzngford cwse, by contending that, because the United States by their pleas deny the
plaintiff's right to recover, the acts complained of are thereby
shown to have been sheer torts, and therefore expressly exempted from judicial cognizance. I am unable to see the
force of this reasoning. The statute having provided that all
claims founded upon provisions of the Constitution shall be
enforceable, surely a district attorney of the United States
cannot by a mere plea, not denying the plaintiff's title to his
land, but claiming that the land is legally subject to a servitude in favor of the United States, which exonerates them
from making compensation, deprive the plaintiff of his right
under the statute to have his claim adjudicated. Can it be
possible that after Congress, in recognition of the constitutional provision and of the repeated suggestions of this court,
has provided a legal remedy, that a subordinate legal functionary can by a plea, either of matter of fact or of law,
defeat the beneficent purpose of Congress, deprive the plaintiff
of his remedy, and convert the United States against their
will, as expressed in the Constitution and the act of Congress,
into a wrongdoer? I cannot accept the proposition that, by
a plea putting the plaintiff upon proof of his claim, the United
States thereby escape from their constitutional covenant and
nullify the statute which provides a remedy
The question presented by the second plea in the court
below is, no doubt, one of difficulty and importance, which, if
and when it comes before this court, will demand serious
consideration, but that question is waived by the opinion of
the court, and any discussion of it in this opinion would be
out of place.
I, therefore, have a right to assume that the property of
the plaintiff below, though held subject to the right of
eminent domain, is entitled to the protection of the Constitution, that there is no kind of private property, whatever may
be its nature or origin, that can be taken for public use without just compensation being made.
Hence it follows that the court below erred in overruling
