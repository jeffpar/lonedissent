Submitted April 17th, 1884.-Decided May 5th, 1884.

Appeal.
Grigsby v. Purcell, 99 U. S. 505, that "an appeal will be dismissed, when, at

IVR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This appeal is dismissed. The decree appealed from was
entered on the 20th of May, 1878, and an appeal allowed
these appellants in open court on the 22d of May. No bond
for the appeal was given until the 7th of October, 1881, the
day on which the cause was for the first time docketed here.
The appeal of May 22d, 1878, became inoperative by reason of
the failure to give the necessary bond and docket the case here
during the October term, 1878, Grigsby v. Purcell, 99 U. S.
505, and the acceptance of the bond in October, 1881, cannot
have the effect of an allowance of a new appeal, because it
was more than two years after the decree had been entered.
-Dismissed.
