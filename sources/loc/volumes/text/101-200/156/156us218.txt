OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Syllabus.

has not gone to final judgment in either court, and what the
result of a trial may be cannot be assumed. We are impressed
with the conviction that the orderly administration of justice
will be better subserved by our declining to exercise appellate
jurisdiction in the mode desired until the conclusion of the
proceedings. If judgment goes against petitioner and is affirmed by the Court of Appeals and a writ of error lies, that
is the proper and better remedy for any cause of complaint he
may have. If, on the other hand, a writ of error does not lie
to this court, and the Supreme Court of the District was absolutely without jurisdiction, the petitioner may then seek his
remedy through application for a writ of ha'eas corpus. We
discover no exceptional circumstances which demand our interposition in advance of adjudication by the courts of the
District upon the merits of the case before them.
