UNITED STATES v. E. 0. KNIGHT COMPANY
.APPEAL FROM

THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT.
Wo. 675. Argued October 24, 194.-Decided January 21, 1295.

The monopoly and restraint denounced by the act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26
Stat. 209, "to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints
and monopolies," are a monopoly in interstate and international trade
or commerce, and not a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of
life.
The American Sugar Refining Company, a corporation existing under the
laws of the State of New Jersey, being in control of a large ma3ority of
the manufactories of refined sugar in the United States, acquired, through
the purchase of stock in four Philadelphia refineries, such disposition
over those manufactories throughout the United States as gave it a
practical monopoly of the business. Held, that the result of the transaction was the creation of a monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary
of life, which could not be suppressed under the provisions of the act
of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, " to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints and monopolies," in the mode attempted in
this suit; and that the acquisition of Philadelphia refineries by a New
Jersey corporation, and the business of sugar refining in Pennsylvania,
bear no direct relation to commerce between the States or with foreign
nations.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

THIS was a bill filed by the United States against E. 0.
Knight Company and others, in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charging that the defendants had violated the provisions of an act
of Congress approved July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints
and monopolies," 26 Stat. 209, "providing that every contract, combination in the form of trust, or otherwise, or
conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the
several States is illegal, and that persons who shall monopolize
or shall attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with
other persons to monopolize trade and commerce among the
several States, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor." The bill
alleged that the defendant, the American Sugar Refining
Company, was incorporated under and by virtue of the laws
of New Jersey, whose certificate of incorporation named the
places in New Jersey and New York at which its principal
business was to be transacted, and several other States in
which it proposed to carry on operations, and stated that the
objects for which said company was formed were "the pur
chase, manufacture, refining, and sale of sugar, molasses, and
melads, and all lawful business incidental thereto," that the
defendant, E. C. Knight Company, was incorporated under
the laws of Pennsylvania "for the purpose of importing, manufacturing, refining and dealing in sugars and molasses," at
the city of Philadelphia, that the defendant, the Franklin
Sugar Company, was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania "for the purpose of the manufacture of sugar and
the purchase of raw material for that purpose," at Philadelphia, that the defendant, Spreckels Sugar Refining Company,
was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania "for the
purpose of refining sugar, which will involve the buying of
the raw material therefor and selling the manufactured
product, and of doing whatever else shall be incidental to
the said business of refining," at the city of Philadelphia,
that the defendant, the Delaware Sugar House, was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania "for the purpose of the
manufacture of sugar and syrups, and preparing the same for

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Statement of the Case.

market, and the transaction of such work or business as may
be necessary or proper for the proper management of the
business of manufacture."
It was further averred that the four defendants last named
were independently engaged in the manufacture and sale of
sugar until on or about March 4, 1892, that the product of
their refineries amounted to thirty-three per cent of the sugar
refined m the United States, that they were competitors
with the American Sugar Refimng Company, that the products of their several refineries were distributed among the several States of the United States, and that all the companies
were engaged in trade or commerce with the several States
and with foreign nations, that the American Sugar Refining
Company had,. on or prior to March 4, 1892, obtained the control of all the sugar refineries of the United States with the
exception of the Revere of Boston, and the refineries of the four
defendants above mentioned, that the Revere produced annually about two per cent of the total amount of sugar refined.
The bill then alleged that in order that the American Sugar
Refining Company might obtain complete control of the price
of sugar in the United States, that company, and John E.
Searles, Jr., acting for it, entered into an unlawful and fraudulent scheme to purchase the stock, machinery, and real estate
of the other four corporations defendant, by which they attempted to control all the sugar refineries for the purpose of
restraining the trade thereof with other States as theretofore
carried on independently by said defendants, that in pursuance of this scheme, on or about March 4, 1892, Searles
entered into a contract with the defendant Knight Company
and individual stockholders named, for the purchase of all
the stock of that company, and subsequently delivered to the
defendants therefor in exchange shares of the American Sugar
Refining Company, that on or about the same date Searles
entered into a similar contract with the Spreckels Company
and individual stockholders, and with the Franklin Company
and stockholders, and with the Delaware Sugar House and
stockholders. It was further averred that the American
Sugar Refining Company monopolized the manufacture and

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

sale of refined sugar in the United States, and controlled
the price of sugar, that in making the contracts, Searles
and the American Sugar Refining Company combined and
conspired with the other defendants to restrain trade and
commerce in refined sugar among the several States and
foreign nations, and that the said contracts were made with
the intent to enable the American Sugar Refining Company
to restrain the sale of refined sugar in Pennsylvania and
among the several States, and to increase the regular price at
which refined sugar was sold, and thereby to exact and secure
large sums of money from the State of Pennsylvania, and
from the other States of the United States, and from all other
purchasers, and that the same was unlawful and contrary to
the said act.
The bill called for answers under oath, and prayed "1. That all and each of the said unlawful agreements
made and entered into by and between the said defendants,
on or about the fourth day of March, 1892, shall be delivered
up, cancelled, and declared to be void, and that the said
defendants, the American Sugar Refining Company and
John E. Searles, Jr., be ordered to deliver to the other said
defendants respectively the shares of stock received by them
in performance of the said contracts, and that the other said
defendants be ordered to deliver to the said defendants, the
American Sugar Refining Company and John E. Searles, Jr.,
the shares of stock received by them respectively in performance of the said contracts.
"2. That an injunction issue preliminary until the final
determination of this cause, and perpetual thereafter, preventing and restraining the said defendants from the further
performance of the terms and conditions of the said unlawful
agreements.
"3. That an injunction may issue preventing and restraining the said defendants from further and continued violations
of the said act of .Congress, approved July 2, 1890.
"14. Such other and further relief as equity and justice may
require in the premises."
Answers were filed and evidence taken, which was thus

sufficiently summarized by Judge Butler in his opinion in the
Circuit Court
"The material facts proved are that the American Sugar
Refining Co., one of the defendants, is incorporated under the
laws of New Jersey, and has authority to purchase, refine, and
sell sugar, that the Franklin Sugar Refinery, the E. C. Knight
Co., the Spreckels Sugar Refinery, and the Delaware Sugar
House, were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania,
and authorized to purchase, refine, and sell sugar, that the
four latter Pennsylvania companies were located in Philadelphia, and prior to March, 1892, produced about thirty-three
per cent of the total amount of sugar refined in the United
States, and were in active competition with the American
Sugar Refining Co., and with each other, selling their product
wherever demand was found for it throughout the United
States, that prior to March, 1892, the American Sugar
Refining Co. had obtained control of all refineries in the
United States, excepting the four located in Philadelphia,
and that of the Revere Co. in Boston, the latter producing
about two per cent of the amount refined in this country,
that in March, 1892, the American Sugar Refining Co. entered
into contracts (on different dates) with the stockholders of
each of the Philadelphia corporations named, whereby it purchased their stock, paying therefor by transfers of stock in
its company, that the American Sugar Refinig Co. thus
obtained possession of the Philadelphia refineries and their
business, that each of the purchases was made subject to the
American Sugar Refining Co. obtaining authority to increase
its stock $25,000,000, that this assent was subsequently obtained and the increase made, that there was no understanding or concert of action between the stockholders of the several
Philadelphia companies respecting the sales, but that those of
each company acted independently of those of the others, and
in ignorance of what was being done by such others, that the
stockholders of each company acted in concert with each other,
understanding and intending that all the stock and property
of the company should be sold, that the contract of sale in
each instance left the sellers free to establish other refineries

and continue the business if they should see fit to do so, and
contained no provision respecting trade or commerce in sugar,
and that no arrangement or provision on this subject has been
made since, that since the purchase the Delaware Sugar
House Refinery has been operated in conjunction with the
Spreckels Refinery, and the E. C. Knight Refinery in connection with the Franklin, this combination being made
apparently for reasons of economy in conducting the business,
that the amount of sugar refined in Philadelphia has been increased since the purchases, that the price has been slightly
advanced since that event, but is still lower than it had been
for some years before, and up to within a few months of the
sales, that about ten per cent of the sugar refined and sold
in the United States is refined in other refineries than those
controlled by the American Sugar Refining Co., that some
additional sugar is produced in Louisiana and some is brought
from Europe, but the amount is not large in either instance.
"The object in purchasing the Philadelphia refineries was
to obtain a greater influence or more perfect control over the
business of refining and selling sugar in this country"
The Circuit Court held that the facts did not show a contract, combination, or conspiracy to restrain or monopolize
trade or commerce "among the several States or with foreign
nations," and dismissed the bill. 60 Fed. Rep. 306. The
cause was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third

UINITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.
Mfu. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER,

after stating the case, delivered

the opimon of the court.
By the purchase of the stock of the four Philadelphia
Tefineries, with shares of its own stock, the American Sugar
Refining Company acquired nearly complete control of the
manufacture of refined sugar within the United States. The bill
-charged that the contracts under which these purchases were
-made constituted combinations in restraint of trade, and that
in entering into them the defendants combined and conspired
to restrain the trade and commerce in refined sugar among
the several States and with foreign nations, contrary to the
;act of Congress of July 2, 1890.
The relief sought was the cancellation of the agreements
under which the stock was transferred, the redelivery of the
-tock to the parties respectively, and an injunction against the
further performance of the agreements and further violations
of the act. As usual, there was a prayer for general relief, but
-only such relief could be afforded under that prayer as would
be agreeable to the case made by the bill and consistent with
that specifically prayed. And as to the injunction asked, that
relief was ancillary to and in aid of the primary equity, or
ground of suit, and, if that failed, would fall with it. That
ground here was the existence of contracts to monopolize
interstate or international trade or commerce, and to restrain
such trade or commerce, which, by the provisions of the act,
could be rescinded, or operations thereunder arrested.
In commenting upon the statute, 21 Jac. 1, c. 3, at the commencement of chapter 85 of the third Institute, entitled
"Against Monopolists, Propounders, and Projectors," Lord
Coke, in language often quoted, said
"It appeareth by the preamble of this act (as a judgment
in Parliament) that all grants of monopolies are against the
ancient and fundamentall laws of this Kingdome. And therefore it is necessary to define what a monopoly is.
"A monopoly is an institution, or allowance by the King
by his grant, commission, or otherwise to any person or
persons, bodies politique, or corporate, of or for the sole

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

buying, selling, making, working, or using of anything,.
whereby any person or persons, bodies politique, or corporate,
are sought to be restrained of any freedome or liberty that
they had before, or hidred in their lawfull trade.
"For the word monopoly, dictur awro T8 1Jov 8 , (i. solo,) xat
7i-X'o/zat, (i. 'vendere,) quod est cum unus solus aliguod genusmercaturc unmersum vendit, ut solus vendat, pretbum ad

in that case.
monopolies."

Trin. 44 Eliz. Lib. 11, f. 84, 85, le case de
3 Inst. 181.

Counsel contend that this definition, as explained by the
derivation of the word, may be applied to all cases in which
"one person sells alone the whole of any kind of marketable
thing, so that only he can continue to sell it, fixing the price
at his own pleasure," whether by virtue of legislative grant or
agreement, that the monopolization referred to in the act of
Congress is not confined to the common law sense of the term
as implying an exclusive control, by authority, of one branch
of industry without legal right of any other person to
interfere therewith by competition or otherwise, but that it
includes engrossing as well, and covers controlling the market
by contracts securing the advantage of selling alone or exclusively all, or some considerable portion, of a particular kind
of merchandise or commodity to the detriment of the public,
and that such contracts amount to that restraint of trade
or commerce declared to be illegal. But the monopoly and
restraint denounced by the act are the monopoly and restraint of interstate and international trade or commerce,
while the conclusion to be assumed on this record is that the
result of the transaction complained of was the creation of a
monopoly in the manufacture of a necessary of life.
In the view which we take of the case, we need not discuss
whether because the tentacles which drew the outlying refineries into the dominant corporation were separately put out,
therefore there was no combination to monopolize, or, because,
according to political economists, aggregations of capital may
reduce prices, therefore the objection to concentration of
power is relieved, or, because others were theoretically left

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.

free to go into the business of refining sugar, and the original
stockholders of the Philadelphia refineries after becoming
stockholders of the American Company might go into competition with themselves, or, parting with that stock, might set
up again for themselves, therefore no objectionable restraint
was imposed.
The fundamental question is, whether conceding that the existence of a monopoly in manufacture is established by the
evidence, that monopoly can be directly suppressed under the
act of Congress in the mode attempted by this bill.
It cannot be denied that the power of a State to protect the
lives, health, and property of its citizens, and to preserve good
order and the public morals, "the power to govern men and
things within the limits of its dominion," is a power originally
and always belonging to the States, not surrendered by them
to the general government, nor directly restrained by the CoTstitution of the United States, and essentially exclusive. The
relief of the citizens of each State from the burden of monopoly and the evils resulting from the restraint of trade among
such citizens was left with the States to deal with, and this.
court has recognized their possession of that power even to the
extent of holding that an employment or busihess carried on
by private individuals, when it becomes a matter of such public interest and importance as to create a common charge or
burden upon the citizen, m other words, when it becomes a
practical monopoly, to which the citizen is compelled to resort
and by means of which a tribute can be exacted from the community, is subject to regulation by state legislative power. On.
the other hand, the power of Congress to regulate commerce
among the several States is also exclusive. The Constitution
does not provide that interstate commerce shall be free, but,
by the grant of this exclusive power to regulate it, it was left
free except as Congress might impose restraints. Therefore
it has been determined that the failure of Congress to exercise
this exclusive power in any case is an expression of its will
that the subject shall be free from restrictions or impositions.
upon it by the several States, and if a law passed by a State in
the exercise of its acknowledged powers comes into conflict,

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

with that will, the Congress and the State cannot occupy the
position of equal opposing sovereignties, because the Constitution declares its supremacy and that of the laws passed in pur:suance thereof, and that which is not supreme must yield to
that which is supreme. "Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic,"
said Chief Justice Marshall, "but it is something more, it is
intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between
nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse."
That which belongs to commerce is within the jurisdiction of
the United States, but that which does not belong to commerce is within the jurisdiction of the police power of the
State. Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 210 Brown v
-Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 448, Thie Iwcense Cases, 5 How
504, 599; -Mobile v EIimball, 102 U S. 691, Bowman v C&ucago & -AT TV Railway, 125 U. S. 465, Lezmy v H1ardin, 135
U S. 100, In re ]2ahrer, 140 U. S. 545, 555.
The argument is that the power to control the manufacture of refined sugar is a monopoly over a necessary of life,
to the enjoyment of which by a large part of the population
of the United States interstate commerce is indispensable, and
that, therefore, the general government in the exercise of the
power to regulate commerce may repress such monopoly
directly and set aside the instruments which have created it.
But this argument cannot be confined to necessaries of life
merely, and must include all articles of general consumption.
Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given
thing involves in a certain sense the control of its disposition,
but this is a secondary and not the primary sense, and although the exercise of that power may result in bringing the
operation of commerce into play, it does not control it, and
affects it only incidentally and indirectly Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it. The power to
regulate commerce is the power to prescribe the rule by which
commerce shall be governed, and is a power independent of
the power to suppress monopoly But it may operate in repression of monopoly whenever that comes within the rules by
which commerce is governed or whenever the transaction is
itself a monopoly of commerce.

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.

It is vital that the independence of the commercial power,
and of the police power, and the delimitation between them,
however sometimes perplexing, should always be recognized
and observed, for while the one furnishes the strongest bond
of union, the other is essential to the preservation of the.
autonomy of the States as required by our dual form of
government, and acknowledged evils, however grave and
urgent they may appear to be, had better be borne, than the,
risk be run, m the effort to suppress them, of more serious
consequences by resort to expedients of even doubtful constltutionality
It will be perceived how far-reaching the proposition is that.
the power of dealing with a monopoly directly may be exercised by the general government whenever interstate or international commerce may be ultimately affected. The regulation
of commerce applies to the subjects of commerce and not to
matters of internal police. Contracts to buy, sell, or exchange
goods to be transported among the several States, the transportation and its instrumentalities, and articles bought, sold,
or exchanged for the purposes of such transit among the
States, or put in the way of transit, may be regulated, but,
this is because they form part of interstate trade or commerce. The fact that an article is manufactured for export.
to another State does not of itself make it an article of interstate commerce, and the intent of the manufacturer does not.
determine the time when the article or product passes from
the control of the State and belongs to commerce. This was.
so ruled in Coe v Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 525, in which the question before the court was whether certain logs cut at a place.

of transportation to the State of Maine were liable to be taxed
like other property in the State of New Hampshire. Mr.
Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court, said
"Does the owner's state of mind in relation to the goods,
that is, his intent to export them, and his partial preparation
to do so, exempt them from taxation 2 This is the precise
question for solution.
There must be a point of time

law and begin to be governed and protected by the national
law of commercial regulation, and that moment seems to us
to be a legitimate one for this purpose, in which they commence their final movement from the State of their origin to
that of their destination."
And again, in .Kdd v Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 20, 21, 22,
where the question was discussed whether the right of a State
to enact a statute prohibiting within its limits the manufacture
of intoxicating liquors, except for certain purposes, could be
overthrown by the fact that the manufacturer intended to export the liquors when made, it was held that the intent of the
manufacturer did not determine the time when the article or
product passed from the control of the State and belonged to
commerce, and that, therefore, the statute, in omitting to except from its operation the manufacture of intoxicating liquors
within the limits of the State for export, did not constitute an
unauthorized interference with the right of Congress to regulate commerce. And Mr. Justice Lamar remarked "No distinction is more popular to the common mind, or more clearly
expressed in economic and political literature, than that between
manufacture and commerce. Manufacture is transformationthe fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use.
The functions of commerce are different. The buying and
selling and the transportation incidental thereto constitute
commerce, and the regulation of commerce in the constitutional sense embraces the regulation at least of such transIf it be held that the term includes the
portation.
regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be
the subject of commercial transactions in the future, it is impossible to deny that it would also include all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. The result would
be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the
States, with the power to regulate, not only manufactures,
but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining-in short, every branch of human industry
For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or
less clearly, an interstate or foreign market 2 Does not the

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Opinion of the Court.

-South, plant, cultivate, and harvest his crop with an eye on
the prices at Liverpool, New York, and Chicago The power
being vested in Congress and denied to the States, it would
follow as an inevitable result that the duty would devolve on
-Congress to regulate all of these delicate, multiform and vital
interests -interests which in their nature are and must be
local in all the details of their successful management.
'The demands of such a supervision would require, not uniform
legislation generally applicable throughout the United. States,
but a swarm of statutes only locally applicable and utterly inconsistent. Any movement toward the establishment of rules
-of production in this vast country, with its many different
-climates and opportunities, could only be at the sacrifice of
the peculiar advantages of a large part of the localities in it, if
not of every one of them. On the other hand, any movement
toward the local, detailed and incongruous legislation reqmred
by such interpretation would be about the widest possible
departure from the declared object of the clause in question.
Nor this alone. Even in the exercise of the power contended
for, Congress would be confined to the regulation, not of certain
branches of industry, however numerous, but to those instances
in each and every branch where the producer contemplated
an interstate market. These instances would be almost infinite, as we have seen, but still there would always remain the
possibility, and often it would be the case, that the producer
contemplated a domestic market. In that case the supervisory
power must be executed by the State, and the interminable
trouble would be presented, that whether the one power or
the other should exercise the authority in question would be
-determined, not by any general or intelligible rule, but by the
secret and changeable intention of the producer in each and
every act of production. A situation more paralyzing to the
-state governments, and more provocative of conflicts between
the general government and the States, and less likely to have
been what the framers of the Constitution intended, it would
be difficult to imagine." And see 7eazze v -Moor,14 How.

In G-ibbons v Ogden, Brown v Maryland, and other cases

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

often cited, the state laws, which were held inoperative, were
instances of direct interference with, or regulations of, interstate or international commerce, yet in Kidd v Pearson the
refusal of a State to allow articles to be manufactured within
her borders even for export was held not to directly affect
external commerce, and state legislation which, in a great
variety of ways, affected interstate commerce and persons
engaged in it, has been frequently sustained because the
interference was not direct.
Contracts, combinations, or conspiracies to control domestic
enterprise in manufacture, agriculture, mining, production in
all its forms, or to raise or lower prices or wages, might unquestionably tend to restrain external as well as domestic
trade, but the restraint would be an indirect result, however
inevitable and whatever its extent, and such result would not
necessarily determine the object of the contract, combination,
or conspiracy
Again, all the authorities agree that in order to vitiate a
contract or combination it is not essential that its result
should be a complete monopoly, it is sufficient if it really
tends to that end and to deprive the public of the advantages
which flow from free competition.
Slight reflection will
show that if the national power extends to all contracts and
combinations in manufacture, agriculture, mining, and other
productive industries, whose ultimate result may affect external commerce, comparatively little of business operations
and affairs would be left for state control.
It was in the light of well-settled principles that the act of
July 2, 1890, was framed. Congress did not attempt thereby
to assert the power to deal with monopoly directly as such, or
to limit and restrict the rights of corporations created by the
States or the citizens of the States in the acquisition, control,
or disposition of property, or to regulate or prescribe the
price or prices at which such property or the products thereof
should be sold, or to make criminal the acts of persons in the
acquisition and control of property which the States of their
residence or creation sanctioned or permitted. Aside from
the provisions applicable where Congress might exercise mu-

Opinion of the Court.

nicipal power, what the law struck at was combinations, contracts, and conspiracies to monopolize trade and commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations, but the
contracts and acts of the defendants related exclusively to
the acquisition of the Philadelphia refineries and the business
of sugar refining in Pennsylvania, and bore no direct relation
to commerce between the States or with foreign nations.
The object was manifestly private gain in the manufacture
of the commodity, but not through the control of interstate
or foreign commerce. It is true that the bill alleged that
the products of these refineries were sold and distributed
among the several States, and that all the compames were
engaged in trade or commerce with the several States and
with foreign nations, but this was no more than to say that
trade and commerce served manufacture to fulfil its function.
Sugar was refined for sale, and sales were probably made at
Philadelphia for consumption, and undoubtedly for resale
by the first purchasers throughout Pennsylvania and other
States, and refined sugar was also forwarded by the companies to other States for sale. Nevertheless it does not
follow that an attempt to monopolize, or the actual monopoly
of, the manufacture was an attempt, whether executory or
consummated, to monopolize commerce, even though, in order
to dispose of the product, the instrumentality of commerce
was necessarily invoked. There was nothing in the proofs
to indicate any intention to put a restraint upon trade or
commerce, and the fact, as we have seen, that trade or commerce might be indirectly affected was not enough to entitle
complainants to a decree. The subject-matter of the sale
was shares of manufacturing stock, and the relief sought was
the surrender of property which had already passed and the
suppression. of the alleged monopoly in manufacture by the
restoration of the 8tatus quo before the transfers,yet the act
of Congress only authorized the Circuit Courts to proceed by
way of preventing and restraining violations of the act in
respect of contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint
of interstate or international trade or commerce.
The Circuit Court declined, upon the pleadings and prodfs,

Decree ofirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

dissenting.

Prior to the 4th day of March, 1892, the American Sugar
Refining Company, a corporation organized under a general
statute of :New Jersey for the purpose of buying, manufacturing, refining, and selling sugar sn different parts of the country, had obtained the control of all the sugar refineries in the
United States except five, of which four were owned and operated by Pennsylvania corporations - the E. C. Knight Company, the Franklin Sugar Refining Company, Spreckels' Sugar
Refining Company, and the Delaware Sugar House -and the
other, by the Revere Sugar Refinery of Boston. These five
corporations were all in active competition with the American
Sugar Refining Company and with each other. The product
of the Pennsylvania companies was about thirty-three per
cent, and that of the Boston company about two per cent, of
the entire quantity of sugar refined in the United States.
In March, 1892, by means of contracts or arrangements
with stockholders of the four Pennsylvania companies, the
New Jersey corporation -using
for that purpose its own
stock -purchased the stock of those companies, and thus obtained absolute control of the entire business of sugar refining
in the United States except that done by the Boston company
which is too small in amount to be regarded in this discussion.
"The object," the court below said, "in -purchasing the
Philadelphia refineries was to obtain a greater influence or
more perfaect control over the busyness of refining ,and selling
sugar sn this country." This characterization of the object
for which this stupendous combination was formed is properly
accepted in the opinion of the court as justified by the
proof. I need not therefore analyze the evidence upon this
point. In its consideration of the important constitutional
question presented, this court assumes on the record before us

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT 00.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

that the result of the transactions disclosed by the pleadings and
proof was the creation of a monopoly in the manufacture of a
necessary of life. If this combination, so far as its operations
necessarily or directly affect interstate commerce, cannot be
restrained or suppressed under some power granted to Congress, it will be cause for regret that the patriotic statesmen
who framed the Constitution did not foresee the necessity of
investing the national government with power to deal with
gigantic monopolies holding in their grasp, and injuriously controlling in their own interest, the entire trade among the States
m food products that are essential to the comfort of every
household in the land.
The court holds it to be vital in our system of government
to recognize and give effect to both the commercial power of
the nation and the police powers of the States, to the end
that. the Union be strengthened and the autonomy of the
States preserved. In this view I entirely concur. "Undoubtedly, the preservation.of the just authority of the States
is an object of deep concern to every lover of his country
NVo greater calamity could befall our free institutions than the
destruction of that authority, by whatever means such a result
might be accomplished. "Without the States in union," this
court has said, "there could be no such political body as the
United States." Lane County v Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76. But
it is equally true that the preservation of the just authority of
the General Government is essential as well to the safety of
the States as to the attainment of the important ends for
which that government was ordained by the People of the
United States, and the destruction of that authority would be
fatal to the peace and well-being of the American people.
The Constitution which enumerates the powers committed to
the nation for objects of interest to the .people of all the
States should not, therefore, be subjected *to an interpretation
so rigid, technical, and narrow, that those objects cannot be
accomplished.

Learned counsel in Gibbons v Ogden, 9 Wheat.

1, 187, having suggested that the Constitution should be strictly
construed, this court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, said
that when the original States "converted their league into a

government,when they converted their Congress of Ambassadors, deputed to deliberate on their common concerns, and to
recommend measures of general utility, into a legislature empowered to enact laws on the most 'interesting subjects, the
whole character in which the States appear underwent a
change, the extent of which must be determined by a fair
consideration of the instrument by which that change was
effected." "What do gentlemen mean," the court inquired,
"by a strict construction 2 If they contend only against that
enlarged construction, which would extend words beyond
their natural and obvious import, one might question the
application of the term, but should not controvert the principle. If they contend for that narrow construction which, in
support of some theory not to be found in the Constitution,
would deny to the government those powers which the words
of the grant, as usually understood, import, and which are
consistent with the general views and objects of the instrument -for that narrow construction, which would cripple the
government, and render it unequal to the objects for which it
is declared to be instituted, and to which the powers given,
as fairly understood, render it competent - then we cannot
perceive the propriety of this strict construction, nor adopt it
as the rule by which the Constitution is to be expounded."
p. 188. On the same occasion the principle was announced
that the objects for which a power was granted to Congress,
especially when those objects are expressed in the Constitution itself, should have great influence in determining the
extent of any given power.
Congress is invested with power to regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States. The power to
regulate is the power to prescribe the rule by which the subject regulated is to be governed. It is one that must be exercised whenever necessary throughout the territorial limits of
the several States. Cokens v l'irgmnit, 6 Wheat. 264, 413.
The power to make these regulations "is complete in itself,
may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no
limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution." It
is plenary because vested in Congress "as absolutely as it

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT C0.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

would be in a single government having in its constitution the
same restrictions on the exercise of the power as are found in
the Constitution of the United States." It may be exercised
"whenever the subject exists." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,
195, 196. In his concurring opinion in that case, Mr. Justice
Johnson observed that the grant to Congress of the power to
regulate commerce carried with it the whole subject, leaving
nothing for the State to act upon, and that "if there was any
one object riding over every other in the adoption of the Constitution, it was to keep commercial intercourse among the
States free from all invidious and partial restraints." p. 231.
"In all commercial regulations we are one and the same
people." Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for this court, said
that the United States are but one country, and are and must
be subject to one system of xegulations in respect to interstate
commerce. 1?obbzns v. Shelby Taxnng Dwstmct, 120 U S. 489,
494.
What is commerce among the States 2 The decisions of this
court fully answer the question. "Commerce, undoubtedly,
is traffic, but it is something more it is intercourse. It does
not embrace the completely interior traffic of the respective
States -that which is "carried on between man and man in a
State, or between different parts of the same State and which
does not extend to or affect other States" -but it does embrace "every species of commercial intercourse" between the
United States and foreign nations and among the States, and,
therefore, it includes such traffic or trade, buying, selling, and
interchange of commodities, as directly affects or necessarily
involves the interests of the People of the United States.
"Commerce, as the word is used in the Constitution, is a
unit," and "cannot stop at the external boundary line of each
State, but may be introduced into the interior." "The genius
and character of the whole government seem to be, that its
action is to be applied to all the external concerns of the
nation, and to those -.nternal concerns whsch affect the States
generally."
These principles were announced in Gibbons v Ogden, and
have often been approved. It is the settled doctrine of this

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion

Harlan, J.

court that interstate commerce embraces something more than
the mere physical transportation of articles of property, and
the vehicles or vessels by which such transportation is effected.
In County of -Mobile v Zimball, 102 U S. 691, 702, it was
said that "commerce with foreign countries and among the
States, strictly considered, consists in intercourse and traffic,
including, in these terms, navigation and the transportation
and transit of persons and property, as well as the purchase,
sale, and exchange of commodities." In Gloucester -FerryCo.
v Pennsylvanta,114 U S. 196, 203, the language of the court
was "Commerce among the States consists of intercourse
and traffic between their citizens, and includes the transportation of persons and property, and the navigation of public
waters for that purpose, as well as the purchase, sale, and
exchange of commodities. The power to regulate that commerce, as well as commerce with foreign nations, vested in
Congress, is the power to prescribe the rules by which it shall
be governed, that is, the conditions upon which it shall be conducted, to determine when it shall be free, and when subject
to duties or other exactions." In Hidd v Pearson, 128
U S. 1, 20, it was said that "the buying and selling, and the
transportation vncdental thereto constitute commerce." Interstate commerce does not, therefore, consist in transportation
simply It includes the purchase and sale of articles that are
intended to be transported from one State to another - every
species of commercial intercourse among the States and with
foreign nations.
In the light of these principles, determining as well the
scope of the power to regulate commerce among the States as
the nature of such commerce, we are to inquire whether the
act of Congress of July 2, 1890, c. 647, entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," 26 Stat. 209, is repugnant to the Constitution.
By that act "every contract, combination in the form of
trust or otherwse, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations," is
declared to be illegal, and every person making any such
contract, or engaging in any such combination or conspiracy,

UNITED STATES v. E. C. K3NIGHT CO.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

is to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and punishable, on
conviction, by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or
by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said
punishments in the discretion of the court. § 1. It is also
made a misdemeanor, punishable in like manner, for any person to "monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or
conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any
part of the trade or commerce among the several States or with
foreign nations." § 2. The act also declares illegal "every
contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any Territory
of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in
restraint of trade or commerce between any such Territory
and another, or between any such Territory or Territories or
any State or States or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any
State or States or foreign nations," and prescribes the-same
punishments for every person making any such contract, or
engaging in any such combination or conspiracy § 3.
The fourth section of the act is in these words "Sec. 4. The
several Circuit Courts of the United States are hereby invested
with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this act,
and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the
United States, in their respective districts, under the direction
of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to
prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may
be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that
such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When
the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of
such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to
the hearing and determination of the case, and pending such
petition and before final decree, the court may at any time
make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall
be deemed just in the premises."
It would seem to be indisputable that no combnahon of
corporations or individuals can, of mght, impose unlawful
restraints upon mterstate trade, whether upon transportation.
or upon such interstate intercourse and traffic as precede trans-

portation, any more than it can, of right, impose unreasonable
restraints upon the completely internal traffic of a State. The
supposition cannot be indulged that this general proposition
will be disputed. If it be true that a combnatwn of corporations or individuals may, so far as the power of Congress is
concerned, subject interstate trade, in any of its stages, to
unlawful restraints, the conclusion is inevitable that the Constitution has failed to accomplish -one primary object of the
Union, which was to place commerce among the States under
the control of the common government of all the people, and
thereby relieve or protect it against burdens or restrictions
imposed, by whatever authority, for the benefit of particular
localities or special interests.
The fundamental inquiry in this case is, What, in a legal
sense, is an unlawful restraint of trade 2
Sir William Erle, formerly Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, in his essay on the Law Relating to Trade Unions, well
said that "restraint of trade, according to a general principle
of the common law, is unlawful;" that "at common law every
person has individually, and the public also have collectvely, a
right to require that the course of trade should be kept free
from unreasonable obstructon , " and that "the right to a
free course for trade is of great importance to commerce and
productive industry, and has been carefully maintained by
those who have administered the common law" pp. 6, 7, 8.
There is a partial restraint of trade which, m certain circumstances, is tolerated by the law The rule upon that subject
is stated in Oregon Steam Nay. Co. v Winsor, 20 Wall. 64,
66, where it was said that "an agreement m general restraint
of trade is illegal and void, but an agreement which operates
merely in partial restraint of trade is good, provided it be not
unreasonable and there be a consideration to support it. In
order that it may not be unreasonable, the restraint imposed
must not be larger than is required for the necessary protection of the party with whom the contract is made. -Horner
v Graves, 7 Bing. 735, 743. A contract, even on good consideration, not to use a trade anywhere in England is held
void in that country as being too general a restraint of trade."

UNITED STATES v. E. C. ]KNIGHT CO.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

But a general restraint of trade has. often resulted from
combvnatwns formed for the purpose of controlling prices by
destroying the opportunity of buyers and sellers to deal with
each other upon the basis of fair, open, free competition.
-Combinations of this character have frequently been the
-subject of judicial scrutiny, and have always been condemned
as illegal because of their necessary tendency to restrain trade.
Such combinations are against common right and are crimes
against the public. To some of the cases of that character it
will be well to refer.
In Mor's Runu CoalCo. v Barclay Coal Co., 68 Penn. St.
1/73, 181, 186, 187, the principal question was as to the
validity of a contract made between five coal corporations of
Pennsylvania, by which they divided between themselves two
-coal regions of which they had the control. The referee in
the case found that those companies acquired under their
arrangement the power to control the entire market for bituminous coal in the northern part of the State, and their combination was, therefore, a restraint upon trade and against
public policy In response to the suggestion that the real
purpose of the combination was to lessen expenses, to advance
the quality of coal, and to deliver it m the markets intended
to be supplied in the best order to the consumer, the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania said "This is denied by the defend.ants, but it seems to us it is immaterial whether these positions are sustained or not. Admitting their correctness, it
-does not follow that these advantages redeem the contract
from the obnoxious effects so strikingly presented by the
referee. The important fact is that these companies control
this immense coal field, that it is -the great source of supply
-of bituminous coal to the State of New York and large territories westward, that by this contract they control the price
of coal in this extensive market, and make it bring sums it
would not command if left to the natural laws of trade, that
.it concerns an article of prime necessity for many uses, that
its operation is general in this large region, and affects all
-who use coal as a fuel, and this is accomplished by a combmation of all the companies engaged in this branch of business

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Harlan, J.

in the large region where they operate. The combination iswide in scope, general in its influence, and injurious in effects.
These being its features, the contract is against public policy,
illegal, and therefore void." Again, in the same case "The
effects produced on the public interests lead to the consideration of another feature of great weight in determining the
illegality of the contract, to wit, the combination resorted to
by these five companies. Singly each might have suspended
deliveries and sales of coal to suit its own interests, and might.
have raised the price, even though this might have been detrimental to the public interest. There is a certain freedom
which must be allowed to every one in the management of his
own affairs. When competition is left free, individual error
or folly will generally find a correction in the conduct of
others. But here is a combination of all the companies oper
ating in the B]ossburg and Barclay mining regions, and
controlling their entire productions. They have combined
together to govern the supply and the price of coal in all the
markets from the Hudson to the Mississippi rivers, and from
Pennsylvania to the lakes. This combination has a power in
its confederated form which no individual action can confer.
The public interest must succumb to it, for it has left no.
competition free to correct its baleful influence. When the
supply of coal is suspended the demand for it becomes importunate, and prices must rise. Or if the supply goes forward,
the price fixed by the confederates must accompany it. The
domestic hearth, the furnaces of the iron master, and the fires
of the manufacturer, all feel the restraint, while many dependent hands are paralyzed and hungry mouths are stinted. The
influence of a lack of supply or a rise in the price of an article
of such prime necessity cannot be measured. It permeates
the entire mass of community, and leaves few of its members
untouched by its withering blight. Such a combination is
more than a contract, it is an offence. II take it,' said
Gibson, J., ' a combination is criminal whenever the act to be
done has a necessary tendency to prejudice the public or to
oppress individuals, by unjustly subjecting them to the power
of the confederates, and giving effect to the purpose of the

UNITED STATES v. E. 0. KNIGHT CO.

latter, whether of extortion or of mischief.' Commonwealth
v Carlisle, Brightly, (Penn.,) 40. In all such combinations
where the purpose is injurious or unlawful, the gist of the
offence is the conspiracy Men can often do by the combination of many what severally no one could accomplish, and
even what when done by one would be innocent." "There is
a potency in numbers when combined, which the law cannot
overlook, where injury is the consequence."
Tins case in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was cited
with approval in Arnot v Pttston & Elmzra Coal Co., 68
N. Y 558, 565, which involved the validity of a contract between two coal companies, the object and effect of which was
to give one of them the monopoly of the trade in coal in a particular region, by which the price of that commodity could be
artifically enhanced. The Court of Appeals of New York held
that "a combination to effect such a purpose is inimical to the
interests of the public, and that all contracts designed to effect
such an end are contrary to public policy, and therefore illegal.
If they should be sustained, the prices of articles of
pure necessity, such as coal, flour and other indispensable commodities, might be artificially raised to a ruinous extent far
exceeding any naturally resulting from the proportion between
supply and demand. No illustration of the mischief of such
contracts is perhaps more apt than a monopoly of anthracite
coal, the region of the production of which is known to be
limited." See also Hooker v JFandewater,4 Demo, 351, 352;
Stanton v Allen, 5 Denio, 434, Saratoga Bank v King, 44
N. Y 87.
In Central Ohio Salt Co. v Guthre, 35 Ohio St. 666, 672,
the principal question was as to the legality of an association
of substantially all the manufacturers of salt in a large salt
producing territory After adverting to the rule that contracts m general restraint of trade are against public policy,
and to the agreement there in question, it was said "Public
policy, unquestionably, favors competition in trade to the end
that its commodities may be afforded to the consumer as
cheaply as possible, and is opposed to monopolies, which tend
to advance market prices, to the injury of the general public.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion

Harlan, J.

The clear tendency of such an agreement is to establish a monopoly, and to destroy competition in trade,
and for that reason, on grounds of public policy, the courts
will not aid in its enforcement. It is no answer to say that
'competition in the salt trade was not in fact destroyed, or that
the price of the commodity was not unreasonably advanced.
Courts will not stop to inquire as to the degree of injury inflicted upon the public, it is enough to know that the. inevitable tendency of such contracts is injurious to the public."
In Craft v _McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346, 349, 350, which
related to a combination between all the grain dealers of a
particular town to stifle competition, and to obtain control of
the price of grain, the Supreme Court of Illinois said "While
the argument, upon its face, would seem to indicate that the
parties had formed a copartnership for the purpose of trading
in grain, yet, from the terms of the contract, and the other
proof in the record, it is apparent that the true object was, to
form a secret combination which would stifle all competition,
and enable the parties, by secret and fraudulent means, to control the price of grain, cost of storage, and expense of shipment. In other words, the four firms, by a shrewd, deep-laid,
secret combination, attempted to control and monopolize the
entire grain trade of the town and surrounding country That
the effect of this contract was to restrain the trade and commerce of the country, is a proposition that cannot be successfully denied. We understand it to be a well-settled rule of
law, that an agreement in general restraint of trade is contrary
to public policy, illegal and void, but an agreement in partial or particular restraint upon trade has been held good,
where the restraint was only partial, consideration adequate,
and the restriction reasonable." "While these parties were in
business, in competition with each other, they had the undoubted right to establish their own rates for grain stored and
commissions for shipment and sale. They could pay as high
or low a price for grain as they saw proper, and as they could
make contracts with the producer. So long as competition
was free, the interest of the public was safe. The laws of
trade, in connection with the right of competition, were all the

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.

guaranty the public required, but the secret combination created
by the contract destroyed all competition and created a monopoly against which the public interest had no protection."
These principles were applied in People v. Chwago Gas
Trust Co., 130 Illinois, 269, 292, 297, which involved the validity of a corporation formed for the purpose of operating gas
works, and of manufacturing and selling gas, and which, for
the purpose of destroying competition, acquired the stock of
four other gas companies, and thereby obtained a monopoly
in the business of fuirmshing illuminating gas to the city of'
Chicago-and its inhabitants. The court, in declaring the organization of the company to be illegal, said "The fact that.
the appellee, almost immediately after its organization, bought
up a majority of the shares of stock of each of these companies, shows that it was not making a mere investment of surplus funds, but that it designed and intended to bring the four
companies under its control, and by crushing out competition
to monopolize the gas business in Chicago." "Of what avail,"
said the court, "is it that any number of gas companies may
be formed under the general incorporation law, if a giant trust.
company can be clothed with the power of buying up and
holding the stock and property of such companies, and, through
the control thereby attained, can direct all their operations andI
weld them into one huge combination 2"
So, in India Bagging Associaton, v Zock, 14: La. Ann..
168, where the court passed upon the legality of an association of various commercial firms in New Orleans that were.
engaged in the sale of India bagging, it was said "The
agreement between the parties was palpably and unequivo
cably a combination in restraint of trade, and to enhance the
price in the market of an article of primary necessity to cotton planters. Such combinations are contrary to public order,.
and cannot be enforced in a court of justice."
In Santa Clara lill & Lumber Co. v HEayes, 76 California,.
387, 390, which related to a combination, the result of certain
contracts among certain manufacturers, the court found that.
the object, purpose, and consideration of those contracts was
to form a combination among all the manufacturers of lumbe

at or near a particular place, for the sole purpose of increasing the price of that article, limiting the amount to be manufactured, and giving certain parties the control of all lumber
manufactured near that place for the year 1881, and of the
supply for that year in specified counties. It held the combination to be illegal, observing that "among the contracts
illegal under the common law, because opposed to public
policy, were contracts in general restraint of trade, contracts
between individuals to prevent competition and keep up the
price of articles of utility" It further said that while the
courts had nothing to do with the results naturally flowing
from the laws of demand and supply, they would not respect
agreements made for the purpose of "taking trade out of the
realm of competition, and thereby enhancing or depressing
prices of commodities."
A leading case on the question as to what combinations are
illegal as being in general restraint of trade, is Richardson v
Buhl, 77 Michigan, 632, 635, 657, 660, which related to certain
agreements connected with the business and operations of the
Diamond Match Company From the report of the case it
appears that that company was organized, under the laws
of Connecticut, for the purpose of uniting in one corporation
all the match manufactories in the United States, and to
monopolize and control the business of making all the friction
matches in the country, and establish the price thereof. To
that end it became necessary, among other things, to buy many
plants that had become established or were about to be establisiied, as well as the property used in connection therewith.
Chief Justice Sherwood of the Supreme Court of Michigan
said "The sole object of the corporation is to make money
by having it in its power to raise the price of the article, or
diminish the quantity to be made and used, at its pleasure.
Thus both the supply of the article and the price thereof are
made to depend upon the action of a half dozen individuals,
more or less, to satisfy their cupidity and avarice, who may
happen to have the controlling interest in this corporation an artificial person, governed by a single motive or purpose,
which is to accumulate money regardless of the wants or neces-

-sities of over 60,000,000 people. The article thus completely
under their control, for the last fifty years, has come to be
regarded as one of necessity, not only in every household in
the land, but one of daily use by almost every individual in
the country It is difficult to conceive of a monopoly which
-can affect a greater number of people, or one more extensive
in its effect on the country, than that of the Diamond Match
Company It was to aid that company in its purposes and in
-carrying out its object that the contract in this case was made
between those parties, which we are now asked to aid in
,enforcing. Monopoly in trade, or in any kind of business in
this country, is odious to our form of government. It is sometimes permitted to aid the government in carrying on a great
public enterprise or public work under governmental control
in the interest of the public. Its tendency is, however, de•structive of free institutions and repugnant to the instincts of
a free people, and contrary to the whole scope and spirit of
the Federal Constitution, and is not allowed to exist under
express provisions in several of our state constitutions.
All combinations among persons or corporations for the purpose of raising or controlling the prices of merchandise, or
any of the necessaries of life, are monopolies and intolerable,
-and ought to receive the condemnation of all courts."
In the same case, Mr. Justice Champlin, with whom Mr.
Justice Campbell concurred, said "There is no doubt that
all the parties to this suit were active participants in perfecting the combination called 'The Diamond Match Company,'
and that the present dispute grows out of that transaction,
and is the fruit of the scheme by which all competition in the
manufacture of matches was stifled, opposition in the business
,crushed, and the whole business of the country in that line
engrossed by the Diamond Match Company Such a vast
combination 'as has been entered into under the above name
is a menace to the public. Its object and direct tendency is to
prevent free and fair competition, and control prices throughout the national domain. It is no answer to say that this
monopoly has in fact reduced the price of friction matches.
That policy may have been necessary to crush competition.

The fact exists that it rests in the discretion of this company
at any time to raise the price to an exorbitant degree. Such
combinations have frequently been condemned by courts as
See also Raymond v
unlawful and against public policy"
Leavdtt, 46 Michigan, 447, and Texas Standard Oil Co. v
Adoue, 83 Texas, 650.
This extended reference to adjudged cases relating to unlawful restraints upon the interior traffic of a State has been made
for the purpose of showing that a combination such as that
organized under the name of the American Sugar Refining Company has been uniformly held by the courts of the States to
be against public policy and illegal because of its necessary
tendency to impose improper restraants upon trade. And
such, I take it, would be the judgment of any Circuit Court
of the United States in a case between parties in which it
became necessary to determine the question. The judgments
of the state courts rest upon general principles of law, and not
necessarily upon statutory provisions expressly condemning
restraints of trade imposed by or resulting from combinations. Of course, in view of the authorities, it will not be
doubted that it would be competent for a State, under the
power to regulate its domestic commerce and for the purpose of protecting its people against fraud and injustice, to
make it a public offence punishable by fine and imprisonment,
for individuals or corporations to make contracts, form combinations, or engage in conspiracies, which unduly restrain
trade or commerce carried on within its limits, and also to
authorize the institution of proceedings for the purpose of
annulling contracts of that character, as well as of preventing
or restraining such combinations and conspiracies.
But there is a trade among the several States which is distinct from that carried on within the territorial limits of a
State. The regulation and control of the former is committed
by the national Constitution to Congress. Commerce among
the States, as this court has declared, is a unit, and in respect
of that commerce this is one country, and we are one people.
It may be regulated by rules applicable to every part of the
United States, and state lines and state jurisdiction cannot

UNITED STATES v. R. C. KNIGHT CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

interfere with the enforcement of such rules. The jurisdiction of the general government extends over every foot of
territory within the United States. Under the power with
which it is invested, Congress may remove unlawful obstructions, of whatever kind, to the free course of trade among the
States. In so doing it would not interfere with the "autonomy of the States," because the power thus to protect interstate commerce is expressly given by the people of all the
States. Interstate intercourse, trade, and traffic is absolutely
free, except as such intercourse, trade, or traffic may be incidentally or indirectly affected by the exercise by the States of
their reserved police powers. Sherlook v Alling, 93 U *. 99,
103. It is the Constitution, the supreme law of the land,
which invests Congress with power to protect commerce
among the States against burdens and exactions arising from
unlawful restraints by whatever authority imposed. Surely
a right secured or granted by that instrument is under the
protection of the government which that instrument creates.
Any combination, therefore, that disturbs or unreasonably
obstructs freedom in buying and selling articles manufactured
to be sold to persons in other States or to be carried to other
States - a freedom that cannot exist if the right to buy and
sell is fettered by unlawful restraints that crush out competition - affects, not incidentally, but directly, the people of all
the States, and the remedy for such an evil is found only in
the exercise of powers confided to a government which, this
court has said, was the government of all, exercising powers
delegated by all,.representing all, acting for all. .MeCulloch
v .Mairyland,4 Wheat. 316, 405.
It has been argued that a combination between corporations
of different States, or between the stockholders of such corporations, with the object and effect of controlling not simply
the manufacture but the price of refined sugar throughout the
whole of the United States- which is the case now before us
- cannot be held to be in restraint of "commerce among the
States" and amenable to national authority, without conceding that, the general government has authority to say what
shall and what shall not be manufactured in the several States.

I1idd v Pealrson,128 U. S. 1, was cited m argument as supporting that view In that case the sole question was,
whether the State of Iowa could forbid the manufacture
within its limits of ardent spirits intended for sale ultimately
in other States. This court held that the manufacture of
intoxicating liquors in a State is none the less a business within
the State subject to state control because the manufacturer
may intend, at his convenience, to export such liquors to
foreign countries or to other States. The authority of the
States over the manufacture of strong drinks within their
respective jurisdictions was referred to their plenary power,
never surrendered to the national government, of providing
for the health, morals, and safety of their people.
That case presented no question as to a comnilnatwmo to
monopolize the sale of ardent spirits manufactured in Iowa to
be sold in other States -no
question as to combinations in
restraint of trade as involved in the buying and selling of
articles that are intended to go, and do go, and will always
go, into commerce throughout the entire country, and are
used by the people of all the States, and the making or manufacturing of which no State could forbid consistently with the
liberty that every one has of pursuing, without undue restrictions, the ordinary callings of life. There is no dispute here
as to the lawfulness of the business of refining sugar, apart
front the undue restraintwhich the promoters of such bustness,
who have cornbmed to controlprwes, seek to put upon the freedomn of tnterstate traffic iq that artwle.
It may be admitted that an act which did nothing more
than forbid, and which had no other object than to forbid, the
mere refining of sugar in any State, would be in excess of any
power granted to Congress. But the act of 1890 is not of
that character. It does not strike at the manufacture simply
of articles that are legitimate or recognized subjects of commerce, but at combinations that unduly restrain, because they
monopolize, the buying and selling of articles which are to go
into interstate commerce. In State v Stewart, 59 Vermont,
273, 286, it was said that if a combination of persons "seek to
restrain trade, or tend to the destruction of the material prop-

erty of the country, they work injury to the whole people."
And in State v Glidden, 55 Connecticut, 46, 75, the court said
"Any one man, or any one of several men acting independently,
is powerless, but when several combine and direct their united
energies to the accomplishment of a bad purpose, the combination is formidable. Its power for evil increases as its numbers

subversive of the rights of others, and the law wisely says
it is a crime." Chief Justice Gibson well said in Com.
monwealth v Carlisle, Brightly, (Penn.,) 36, 41 "There is
between the different parts of the body politic a reciprocity
of action on each other, which, like the action of antagonizing
muscles in the natural body, not only prescribes to each its
appropriate state and action, but regulates the motion of the
whole. The effort of an individual to disturb this equilibrium
can never be perceptible, nor carry the operation of his interest
or that of any other individual beyond the limits of fair competition, but the increase of power by combination of means,
being in geometrical proportion to the number concerned, an
association may be able to give an impulse, not only oppressive
to individuals, but mischievous to the public at large, and it
is the employment of an engine so powerful and dangerous
that gives criminality to an act that would be perfectly
innocent, at least in a legal view, when done by an individual."
These principles underlie the act of Congress, which has for
its sole object the protection of such trade and commerce as
the Consttution, confides to naftonal control, and the question
is presented whether the combmation assailed by this suit is
an unlawful restraint upon interstate trade in a necessary
article of food which, as every one knows, has always entered,
now enters and must continue to enter, in vast quantities, into
commerce among the States.
In .idd v Pearsonwe recognized, as had been done in previous cases, the distinction between the mere transportation
of articles of interstate commerce and the purchaszng and
selling thatyrecedetr-ansportation. It is said that manufacture
precedes commerce and is not a part of it. But it is equally
true that when manufacture ends, that wnch has been manu-

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

factured becomes a subject of commerce, that buying and
selling succeed manufacture, come into existence after the
process of manufacture is completed, precede transportation,
and are as much commercial intercourse, where articles are
bought to be carried from one State to another, as is the
manual transportation of such articles after they have been
so purchased. The distinction was recognized by this court
in Gibbons v Ogden, where the principal question was whether
commerce included navigation. Both the court and counsel
recognized buying and selling or barter as ncluded =
commerce. Chief Justice Marshall said that the mind can
scarcely conceive a system for regulating commerce, which
was "confined to prescribing rules for the conduct of individuals in the actual employment of buying and selling, or of
barter." pp. 189, 190.
The power of Congress covers and protects the absolute
freedom of such intercourse and trade among the States as
may or must succeed manufacture and precede transportation
from the place of purchase. This would seem to be conceded,
for, the court in the present case expressly declare that "contracts to buy, sell, or exchange goods to be tranmsorted among

the several States, the transportation and its instrumentalities,
and articles bought, sold, or exchanged for the purpose of
such transit among the States, or put in the way of transit,
may be regulated,but this is because they form part of snterstate trade or commerce." Here is a direct admission - one

which the settled doctrines of this court justify - that contracts to buy and the purchasing of goods to be tran&ported
from one State to another, and transportation, with its instrumentalities, are all _parts of interstate trade or commerce.
Each part of such trade is then under the protection of Congress. And yet, by the opinion and judgment in this case, if
I do not misapprehend them, Congress is without power to
protect the commercial intercourse that such purchasing necessarily involves against the restraints and burdens arising from
the existence of combtnations that meet purchasers, from whatever State they come, with the threat - for it is nothing more
nor less than a threat

-

that they shall not purchase what

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

they desire to purchase, except at the przces fixed by such combinations. A citizen of Missouri has the right to go in person, or send orders, to Pennsylvania and New Jersey for the
purpose of purchasing refined sugar. But of what value is
that right if he is confronted in those States by a vast cornbnmation which absolutely controls the price of that article by
reason of its having acquired all the sugar refineries in the
United States in order that they may fix prices in their own
interest exclusively 2
In my judgment, the citizens of the several States composing the Union are entitled, of right, to buy goods in the
State where they are manufactured, or in any other State,
without being confronted by an illegal combination whose
business extends throughout the whole country, which by the
law everywhere is an enemy to the public interests, and which
prevents such buying, except at prices arbitrarily fixed by it.
I insist that the free course of trade among the States cannot
coexist with such combinations. When I speak of trade I
mean the buying and selling of articles of every kind that are
recognized articles of interstate commerce. Whatever improperly obstructs the free course of interstate intercourse
and trade, as involved in the buying and selling of articles
to be carried from one State to another, may be reached by
Congress, under its authority to regulate commerce among the
States. The exercise of that authority so as to make trade
among the States, in all recognized articles of commerce,
absolutely free from unreasonable or illegal restrictions imposed by combinations, is justified by an express grant of
power to Congress and would redound to the welfare of the
whole country I am unable to perceive that any such result
would imperil the autonomy of the States, especially as that
result cannot be attained through the action of any one State.
Undue restrictions or burdens upon the purchasing of goods,
in the market for sale, to be transported to other States, cannot be inposed even by a State without violating the freedom
of commercial intercourse guaranteed by the Constitution.
But if a State within whose limits the business of refining
sugar is exclusively carried on may not constitutionally ir-

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

pose burdens upon purchases of sugar to be transportedto other

States, how comes it that combinations of corporations or individuals, within the same State, may not be prevented by the
national government from putting unlawful restraints upon
the purchasing of that article to be earredfrom the State in
which such purchases are made 9 If the national power is

competent to repress State action in restraint of interstate
trade as it may be involved in purchases of refined sugar
to be transported from one State to another State, surely it
ought to be deemed sufficient to prevent unlawful restraints
attempted to be imposed by combinations of corporations or
individuals upon those identical purchases, otherwise, illegal
combinations of corporations or individuals may -so far as
national power and interstate commerce are concerned -do,
with impunity, what no State can do.
Suppose that a suit were brought in one of the courts of
the United States -jurisdiction being based, it may be, alone
upon the diverse citizenship of the parties-to enforce the
stipulations of a written agreement, which had for its object
to acquire the possession of all the sugar refineries in the
United States, in order that those engaged m the combination
might obtain the entire control of the business of refining and
selling sugar throughout the country, and thereby to increase
or diminish prices as the particular interests of the combination might require. I take it that the court, upon recognized
principles of law common to the jurisprudence of this country
and of Great Britain, would deny the relief asked and dismiss
the suit upon the ground that the necessary tendency of such
an agreement and combination was to restrain, not simply
trade that was completely internal to the State in which the
parties resided, but trade and commerce among all the
States, and was, therefore, against public policy and illegal.
If I am right in this view, it would seem to follow, necessarily,
that Oongress could enact a statute forbidding such combinations so far as they affected interstate commerce, and provide
for their suppression as well through civil proceedings instituted for that purpose, as by penalties against those engaged
in them.

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.

Harlan, J.

In committing to Congress the control of commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States, the Constitution
did not define the means that may be employed to protect the
freedom of commercial intercourse and traffic established for
the benefit of all the people of the Union. It wisely forbore
to impose any limitations upon the exercise of that power
except those arising from the general nature of the government, or such as are embodied in the fundamental guarantees
of liberty and property It gives to Congress, in express
words, authority to enact all laws necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the power to regulate commerce, and
whether an act of Congress, passed to accomplish an object to
winch the general government is competent, is within the
power granted, must be determined by the rule announced
through Chief Justice Marshall three-quarters of a century
ago, and which has been repeatedly affirmed by this court.
That rule is "The sound construction of the Constitution
must allow to the national legislature the discretion with
respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be
carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform
the high duties assigned to it m the manner most beneficial to
the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the
scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, are constitutional." MoCulloch v. -farylan4
4 Wheat. 316, 421. The end proposed to be accomplished by
the act of 1890 is the protection of trade and commerce among
the States against unlawful restraints.. Who can say that that
end is not legitimate or is not within the scope of the Constitution 2 The means employed are the suppression, by legal
proceedings, of combinations, conspiracies, and monopolies,
which by their inevitable and admitted tendency, improperly
restrain trade and commerce among the States. Who can say
that such means are not appropriate to attain the end of freeing commercial intercourse among the States from burdens
and exactions imposed upon it by combinations which, under
principles long recognized in this country as well as at the

OCTOBER TERI, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion

Harlan, J.

common law, are illegal and dangerous to the public welfare?
What clause of the Constitution can be referred to which prohibits the means thus prescribed in the act of Congress 2
It may be that the means employed by Congress to suppress combinations that restrain interstate trade and commerce are not all or the best that could have been devised.
But Congress. under the delegation of authority to enact laws
necessary and proper to carry into effect a power granted, is
not restricted to the employment of those means "without
which the end would be entirely unattainable." "To have
prescribed the means," this court has said, "by which government should, in all future time, execute its powers, would have
been to change entirely the character of that instrument, and
give it the properties of a legal code. It would have been an
unwise attempt to provide, by immutable rules for exigencies
which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly and
which can be best provided for as they occur. To have
declared that the best means shall not be used, but those
alone without which the power given would be nugatory,
would have been to deprive the legislature of the capacity to
avail itself of experience, to exercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation to circumstances." Again "Where
the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any
of the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake here
to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the
line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread
on legislative ground." .M cCulloch v .Ma?'yland, 4 Wheat.
316, 415, 423.
By the act of 1890, Congress subjected to forfeiture "any
property owned under any contract or by any combination,
or pursuant to any conspiracy, (and being the subject thereof,)
mentioned in section one of this act, and being in the course
of transportation from one State to another, or to a foreign
country " It was not deemed wise to subject such property
to forfeiture before transportation began or after it ended. If
it be suggested that Congress might have prohibited the transportatson from the State in which they are manufactured of
any articles, by whomsoever at the time owned, that had been

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

manufactured by combinations formed to monopolize some
designated part of trade or commerce among the States, my
answer is that it is not within the functions of the judiciary
to adjudge that Congress shall employ particular means in
execution of a given power, simply because such means are, in
the judgment of the courts, best conducive to the end sought
to be accomplished. Congress, in the exercise of its discretion
as to choice of means conducive to an end to which it was
competent, determined to reach that end through civil proceedings instituted to prevent or restrain these obnoxious combinations in their attempts to burden interstate commerce by
obstructions that interfere sn advance of transTvortation with
the free course of trade between the people of the States. In
other words, Congress sought to prevent the coming into
-existence of combinations, the purpose or tendency of which
was to impose unlawful restraints upon interstate commerce.
There is nothing in conflict with these views in Coe v.
Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 529. There the question was whether
certain logs cut in New Hampshire, and hauled to a river that
they might be transported to another State, were liable to be
taxed in the former State before actual transportation to the
latter State began. The court held that the logs might be
taxed while they remained in the State of their origin as part
of the general mass of property there, that "for ths pr_pose"

-

taxation - the property did not pass from the juris-

diction of the State in which it was until transportation began.
The scope of the decision is clearly indicated by the following
-clause in the opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley "How can
property thus situated, to wit, deposited or stored at the
place of entrep6t for future exportation, be taxed in the regular way as part of the property of the State 2 The answer is
plain. It can be taxed as all other property is taxed, in the
place where it is found, if taxed or assessed for taxation in the
usual manner in which such property is taxed, and not
singled out to be assessed by itself in an unusual and exceptional manner because of its situation." As we have now no
.question as to the taxation of articles manufactured by one
-of the combinations condemned by the act. of Congress, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Harlan, J.

as no one has suggested that the State in which they may be
manufactured could not tax them as property so long as they
remained within its limits, and before transportation of them
to other States began, I am at a loss to understand how the
case before us can be affected by a decision that personal
property, while it remains in the State of its origin, although
it is to be sent at a future time to another State, is within the
jurisdiction of the former State for purposes of taxation.
The question here relates to restraints upon the freedom of
interstate trade and commerce imposed by illegal combinations. After the fullest consideration I have been able to
bestow upon this important question, I find it impossible torefuse my assent to this proposition Whatever a State may
do to protect its completely interior traffic or trade against
unlawful restraints, the general government is empowered to
do for the protection of the people of all the States-for this
purpose one people - against unlawful restraints imposed upon
interstate traffic or trade in articles that are to enter into
commerce among the several States. If, as already shown, a
State may prevent or suppress a combmnation, the effect of
which is to subject its domestic trade to the restraints necessarily arising from their obtaining the absolute control of thesale of a particular article in general use by the community,
there ought to be no hesitation in allowing to Congress theright to suppress a similar comlnation that imposes a like
unlawful restraint upon interstate trade and traffic in that
article. While the States retain, because they have never
surrendered, full control of their completely internal traffic,
it was not intended by the framers of the Constitution that
any part of interstate commerce should be excluded from the
control of Congress. Each State can reach and suppress combinations so far as they unlawfully restrain its interior trade,
while the national government may reach and suppress them
so far as they unlawfully restrain trade among the States.
While the opinion of the court in this case does not declare
the act of 1890 to be unconstitutional, it defeats the main
object for which it was passed. For it is, in effect, held that
the statute would be unconstitutional if interpreted as em-

UNITED STATES v. E. C. KNIGHT CO.

Harlan, J.

bracing such unlawful restraints upon the purchasing of goods
in one State to be carried to another State as necessarily arise
from the existence of combinations formed for the purpose and
with the effect, not only of monopolizing the ownership of all
such goods in every part of the country, but of controlling the
prices for them in all the States. This view of the scope of
the act leaves the public, so far as national power is concerned, entirely at the mercy of combinations which arbitrarily control the prices of articles purchased to be transported
from one State to another State. I cannot assent to that
view In my judgment, the general government is not placed
by the Constitution in such a condition of helplessness that it
must fold its arms and remain inactive while capital combines,
under the name of a corporation, to destroy competition, not
m one State only, but throughout the entire country, in the
buying and selling of articles -especially
the necessaries of
life- that go into commerce among the States. The doctrine of the autonomy of the States cannot properly be invoked to justify a denial of power in the national government
to meet such an emergency, involving as it does that freedom
of commercial intercourse among the States which the Constitution sought to attain.
It is said that there are no proofs in the record which indicate an mitentzon upon the part of the American Sugar Refining Company and its associates to put a restraint upon trade
or commerce. Was it necessary that formal proof be made
that the persons engaged m this combination admitted, in
words, that they intended to restrain trade or commerce2
Did any one expect to find in the written agreements which
resulted m the formation of this combination a distinct expression of a purpose to restrain interstate trade or commerce 2
Men who form and control these combinations are too cautious and wary to make such admissions orally or in writing.
Why, it is conceded that the object of this combination was
to obtain control of the business of making and selling refined
sugar throughout the entire country Those interested in its
operations will be satisfied with nothing less than to have the
whole population of America pay tribute to.them. That object

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion

Harlan, J.

is disclosed upon the very face of the transactions described in
the bill. And it is proved - indeed, is conceded - that that
object has been accomplished to the extent that the American
Sugar Refining Company now controls ninety-eight per cent
of all the sugar refining business in the country, and therefore
controls the price of that article everywhere. Now, the mere
emstence of a combination having such an object and possessing such extraordinary power is itself, under settled principles
of law -there being no adjudged case to the contrary in this
country- a direct restraint of trade in the article for the control of the sales of which in this country that combination
was organized. And that restraint is felt in all the States,
for the reason, known to all, that the article in question goes,
was intended to go, and must always go, into commerce among
the several States, and into the homes of people in every condition of life.
A decree recognizing the freedom of commercial intercourse
as embracing the right to buy goods to be transported from
one State to another, without buyers being burdened by unlawful restraints imposed by combinations of corporations or
individuals, so far from disturbing or endangering, would tend
to preserve the autonomy of the States, and protect the people
of all the States against dangers so portentous as to excite
apprehension for the safety of our liberties. If this be not
a sound interpretation of the Constitution, it is easy to perceive that interstate traffic, so far as it involves the price to
be paid for articles necessary to the comfort and well-being
of the people in all the States, may pass under the absolute
control of overshadowing combinations having financial resources without limit and an audacity in the accomplishment
of their objects that recognizes none of the restraints of moral
obligations controlling the action of individuals, combinations
governed entirely by the law of greed and selfishness -so
powerful that no single State is able to overthrow them and
give the required protection to the whole country, and so allpervading that they threaten the integrity of our institutions.
We have before us the case of a combination which absolutely controls, or may, at its discretion, control the price of all

refined sugar in this country Suppose another combnaton,
organized for private gain and to control prices, should obtain
possession of all the large flour mills in the United States, another, of all the grain elevators, another, of all the oil territory, another, of all the salt-producing regions, another, of
all the cotton mills, and another, of all the great establishments for slaughtering animals, and the preparation of meats..
What power is competent to protect the people of the United

part of the territory and over all the people of the nation 2

Congress may impose or permit for the benefit of the whole

which concerns equally all the people of the Union, and which,.

combination in question was formed, may not, in view of the
facts disclosed, be effectual to accomplish the object of the act

a decree declaring that that combination imposes an unlawful
restraint upon trade and commerce among the States, and perpetually enjoining it from further prosecuting any business
pursuant to the unlawful agreements under which it was
formed or by which it was created. Such a decree would be
within the scope of the bill, and is appropriate to the end
which Congress intended to accomplish, namely, to protect the
freedom of commercial intercourse among the States against
combinations and conspiracies which impose unlawful restraints
upon such intercourse.
For the reasons stated I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.
