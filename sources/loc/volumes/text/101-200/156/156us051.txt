SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT

OF THE UNITED STATES FOR 'THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 618. Submitted March 5, 1894. - Decided January 21, 1895.

If one of two persons accused of having together committed the crime of
murder makes a voluntary confession in the presence of the other, under
such circumstances that he would naturally have contradicted it if he did
not assent, the confession is admissible in evidence against both.
If two persons are indicted and tried jointly for murder, declarations of one
made after the killing and in the absence of the other, tending to prove
the guilt of both, are admissible in evidence against the one making thie
declarations, but not against the other.
An objection to the admissibility of such evidence, made at the trial in the
name of both defendants, on the general ground that it was irrelevant,
immaterial, and incompetent, furnishes, if the testimony be admitted, sufficient ground in case of conviction for bringing the case to this court,
and warrants the reversal of the conviction of the defendant against
whom it was not admissible.
Confession of a person imprisoned and in irons, under an accusation of having committed a capital offence, are admissible in evidence against him,
if they appear to have been voluntary, and not obtained by putting him
in fear, or by promises.
Section 1035 of the Revised Statutes does not authorize a jury in a criminal
case to find the defendant guilty of a less offence than the one charged,
unless the evidence justifies it; but it enables the jury, in case the defendant is not shown to be guilty of the particular crime charged, to find
him guilty of a lesser offence necessarily included in the one charged, or
of the attempt to commit the one charged, when the evidence permits
that to be done.
In the courts of the United States it is the duty of the jury, in criminal
cases, to receive the law from the court, and to apply it as given by the
court, subject to the condition that by a general verdict a jury of necessity determines both law and fact as compounded in the issue submitted
to them in the particular case.
In criminal cases it is competent for the court to instruct the jury as to the
legal presumptions arising from a given state of facts, but it may not,
by a peremptory instruction, require the jury to find the accused guilty of
the offence charged, nor of any offence less than that charged.
On the trial in a court of the United States of a person accused of committing the crime of murder, if there be no evidence upon which the jury
can properly find the defendant guilty of an offence included in or less
than the one charged, it is not error to instruct them that they cannot
return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter, or of any offence less than

the one charged, and, in such case, if the defendant was not guilty of
the offence charged, it is the duty of the jury to return a verdict of not
guilty.

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiffs in error and Thomas St. Clair were indicted
jointly for the murder of Maurice Fitzgerald upon the high
seas, on board of an American vessel, the bark Hesper, as set
forth in the indictment mentioned in St. laitr v United
States, 154 U S. 134. On motion of the accused it was ordered that they be tried separately St. Clair was tried,
found guilty of murder, and sentenced to suffer the pumshment of death. Subsequently the order for separate trials
was set aside, and the present defendants were tried together,
and both were convicted of murder. A motion for a new
trial having been overruled, a like sentence was imposed
upon them.
The general facts of this case do not differ from those
proved in St. Clair's case, and some of the questions arising
upon the present assignments of error were determined in
that case. Only such questions will be here examined as
were not properly presented or did not arise in the other case,
and as are of sufficient importance to require notice at our
hands.
In the night of January 13, 1893, Fitzgerald, the second
mate of the Hesper, was found to be missing, and it was believed that he had been killed and his body thrown overboard. Suspicion being directed to St. Clair, Sparf, and
Hansen, part of the crew of the Hesper, as participants in
the killing, they were put in irons by order of Captain Sodergren, master of the vessel, and were so kept during the

Opinion of the Court.

voyage from the locality of the supposed murder to Tahiti,
.an island in the South Pacific belonging to the French
government. They were taken ashore by the United States
-consul at that island, and subsequently were sent, with
.others, to San Francisco on the vessel Tropic Bird.
At the trial, Captain Sodergren, a witness for the govern-ment, was asked whether or not after the 13th day of January and before reaching Tahiti-which was more than one
thousand miles from the locality of the alleged murder-he
had any conversation with the defendant Hansen about the
-killing of Fitzgerald. This question having been answered
by the witness in the affirmative, he was fully examined as
to the circumstances under which the conversation was held.
He said among other things that no one was present but Hanzsen and himself. Being asked to repeat the conversation referred to, the accused, by the counsel who had been appointed
by the court to represent them, objected to the question as
"irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent, and upon the ground
that any statement made by Hansen was not and could not be
voluntary" The objection was overruled, and the defendants
,duly excepted. The witness then stated what Hansen had said
to him. That evidence tended strongly to show that Fitzgerald was murdered pursuant to a plan formed between St.
-Clair, Sparf, and Hansen, that all three actively participated
in the murder, and that the crime was committed under the
most revolting circumstances.
Thomas Green and Edward Larsen, two of the crew of the
Ilesper, were also witnesses for the government. They were
permitted to state what Hansen said to them during the voyage from Tahiti to San Francisco. This evidence was also
.objected to as irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent, and
upon the further ground that the statement the accused was
represented to have made was not voluntary But the objection was overruled and an exception taken.
Upon the conclusion of the evidence the defendants re.quested certain instructions which the court refused to give,
and they excepted to its action in that particular, as well as to
,certain parts of the charge to the jury

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

1. The declarations of Hansen, as detailed by Sodergren,
Green, and Larsen, were clearly admissible in evidence against
him. There was no ground on which their exclusion could
have been sustained. In reference to this proof, the court
charged the jury that if they believed from the evidence that
Green and Larsen or either of them were accomplices in the
commission of the acts charged in the indictment, they should
act upon their testimony with great caution, subjecting it to a
careful examination in the light of all the other evidence, and
ought not to convict upon their testimony alone, unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of its truth, that if Larsen and
Green or either of them or any other person were induced tG
testify by promises of immunity from punishment, or by hope
held out from any one that it would go easier with them in
case they disclosed their confederates, or in case they implicated some one else in the crime, this must be taken into consideration in determining the weight to be given to their
testimony, and should be closely scrutinized, that the confessions of a prisoner out of court and in custody made to persons
having no authority to examine him, should be acted upon and
received with great care and caution, that words are often
misreported through ignorance, inattention, or malice, are
extremely liable to misconstruction, are rarely sufficient to,
warrant conviction as well on account of the great danger of
mistake upon the part of the witness, as of the fact that the
mind of the prisoner himself may be oppressed by his situation or influenced by motives of hope or fear to make an untrue confession, that in considering the weight to be given
to the alleged confessions of the defendants, the jury were
to consider their condition at the time they were made, the,
fact that they had been charged with crime, and were in
custody, and that the jury were to determine whether those
confessions were voluntary or whether any inducements were
held out to them by any one. The defendants did not offer
themselves as witnesses, and the court took care to say that a
person charged with crime is under no obligation to testify
in his own behalf, and that his neglect to testify did not create.
any presumption whatever against him.

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

So far as the record discloses, these confessions were entirely
free and voluntary, uninfluenced by any hope of reward or fear
of punishment.

In Mopt v U 1h, 110 U S. 574, 584, it was

said "While some of the adjudged cases indicate distrust of
confessions which are not judicial, it is certain, as observed by
Baron Parke, in Regna v Baldry, 2 Denmson & Pearce
Or. Cas. 430, 445, that the rule against their admissibility has
been sometimes carried too far, and in its application justice
and common sense have too frequently been sacrificed at the
shrine of mercy A confession, if freely and voluntarily made,
is evidence of the most satisfactory character. Such a confession, said Eyre, C. B., King v Wa 'tckshall, 1 Leach Cr. Law,
263, ' is deserving of the highest credit, because it is presumed
to flow from the strongest sense of guilt, and, therefore, it is
admitted as proof of the crime to which it refers.' Elementary
writers of authority concur in saying that while from the
nature of such evidence it must be subjected to careful scrutiny and received with great caution, a deliberate voluntary
confession of guilt is among the most effectual proofs in the
law and constitutes the strongest evidence against the party
making it that can be given of the facts stated in such confession."
Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot be a voluntary statement, a free open confession, while a defendant is
confined and in irons under an accusation of having committed
a capital offence. We have not been referred to any authority
in support of that position. It is true that the fact of a prisoner being in custody at the time he makes a confession is a
circumstance not to be overlooked, because it bears upon the
inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made or was
extorted by threats or violence or made under the influence of
fear. But confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to
have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the
prisoner in fear or by promises. Wharton's Cr. Ev 9th ed.
§§ 661, 663, and authorities cited. The import of Sodergren's
evidence was that when Hansen manifested a desire to speak
to him on the subject of the killing, the latter said he did not

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

wish to hear it, but "to keep it until the right time came and
then tell the truth." But this was not offering to the prisoner
an inducement to make a confession. Littledale, J., well
observed in Rex v Court, 7 Car. & P 486, that telling a man
to be sure to tell the truth is not advising him to confess anything of which he is really not guilty See also Queen v
Reeve, L. IR.
1 C. C. 362. Nothing said to Hansen prior to
the confession was at all calculated to put him in fear or to
excite any hope of his escaping punishment by telling what he
knew or witnessed or did n reference to the killing.
The declarations of Hansen after the killing, as detailed by
Green and Larsen, were also admissible in evidence against
Sparf, because they appear to have been made in his presence
and under such circumstances as would warrant the inference
that he would naturally have contradicted them if he did not
assent to their truth.
But the confession and declarations of Hansen to Sodergren
after the killing of Fitzgerald were incompetent as evidence
against Sparf. St. Clair, Hansen, and Sparf were charged
jointly with the murder of Fitzgerald. What Hansen said after
the deed had been fully consummated, and not on the occasion
of the killing and in the presence only of the witness, was
clearly incompetent against his codefendant, Sparf, however
strongly it tended to connect the latter with the commission
of the crime. If the evidence made a case of conspiracy to
kill and murder, the rule is settled that "after the conspiracy
has come to an end, and whether by success or by failure, the
admissions of one conspirator by way of narrative of past
facts are not admissible in evidence against the others."
Logan v Unz'ted States, 144 U S.263, 309 , Brown v Unt-ed

States, 150 U S. 93, 98, Wright's Criminal Conspiracies, Carson's ed. 212, 213, 217, 1 Greenleaf, § 233. The same rule is
applicable where the evidence does not show that the killing
was pursuant to a conspiracy, but yet was by the joint act of
the defendants.
The objection to the question, in answer to which the declarations of Hansen to Sodergren were given, was sufficiently
specific. The general rule undoubtedly is that an objection

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opmion of the Court.

should be so framed as to indicate the precise point upon which
the court is asked to rule. It has, therefore, been often held
that an objection to evidence as irrelevant, immaterial, and
incompetent, nothing more being stated, is too general to be
'considered on error, if in any possible circumstances it could
be deemed or could be made relevant, material, or competent.
But this principle will not sustain the ruling by which the
declarations of Hansen, made long after the commission of the
alleged murder, and not in the presence of Sparf, were admitted as evidence against the latter. In no state of case were
those declarations competent against Sparf. Its inadmissibility as to hnm was apparent. It appeared upon the very face
of the question itself.
In People v Beach, 87 N. Y 508, 513, which was an indictment for petit larceny, the prosecution offered in evidence the
statements of a third party, not in the presence of the accused,
which related to the vital point upon which the conviction
turned. There was a general objection to the evidence. The
-court said "We think, however, the general objection made
in this case was sufficient. It appeared, when the objection
was made, that the conversation proposed to be shown was
between the prosecutor and Hardacre, when the defendant
vas not present. There was no possible view of the case, as
it then or afterward stood, in which such a conversation was
admissible. When the witness was asked to state the conversation, and counsel objected, both the court and the prosecuting officer must have understood that it was an objection to
the competency of the proposed evidence. If the objection
had been made in terms, on the ground that the evidence was
incompetent, the sufficiency of the objection could not have
been questioned, and the objection, as made, necessarily implied this. Neither the court nor prosecuting attorney could
have been misled as to the point of the objection. It was
patent on considering the objection m connection with the
proof offered. If any doubt could be entertained as to the
technical sufficiency of the objection, we should be disinclined
in a criminal case, to deprive a defendant of the benefit of an
exception by the strict application of a rule more especially

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

applicable to civil cases, when we can see that its application
would produce injustice." And in Turner v. City of IHewburgh, 109 N. Y 301, 308, it was said "This court has held
that when the objection to evidence is general and it isoverruled and the evidence is received, the ruling will not be held
erroneous unless there be some grounds which could not have.
been obviated had they been specified, or unless the evidence
in its essential nature be incompetent." Tozer v. 1 T Y Central & Hudson River Railroad,105 N. Y 659, Alcorn v.
Chwago & Alton Railway, 108 M1issouri, 81, Curr v Bund,ley, (Colorado) 31 Pac. Rep. 939, 940, .cfCaden v Lowensten,
92 Tennessee, 614, Ward v Wilms, 16 Colorado, 86.
We are of opinion that as the declarations of Hansen to Sodergren were not, in any view of the case, competent evidenceagainst Sparf, the court, upon objection being made by counsel representing both defendants, should have excluded them
as evidence against him, and admitted them agaanst Hansen.
The fact that the objection was made in the name of both defendants did not justify the court in overruling it as to both,
when the evidence was obviously incompetent and could not
have been made competent against Sparf, and was obviously
competent against Hansen. It was not necessary that counsel
should have made the objection on behalf of one defendant
and then formally repeated it, in the same words, for theother defendant. If Sparf had been tried alone, a general objection in his behalf on the ground of incompetency would
have been sufficiently definite. Surely, such an objection
coming from Sparf when tried with another ought not to bedeemed ineffectual because of the circumstance that his counsel, who by order of the court represented also his codefendant, incautiously spoke in the name of both defendants. Each
was entitled to make his own defence, and the jury could have,
found one of them guilty and acquitted the other. Mutual
i2fe Ins. Co. v Hillmon, 145 U S. 285, 293. See also Commonwealth v Robinson, I Gray, 555, 560.
For the error of the court in not sustaining the objection referred to, so far as it related to Sparf, the judgment must be
reversed as to him. If he were the only defendant, we might.

Opinon of the Court.

withhold any expression of opinion upon other questions raised
by the assignments of error. But as some of those questions
are important and may arise upon another trial of Sparf, and
especially as they must be now determined with reference to
Hansen, we proceed to their examination.
2. One of the specifications of error relates to the refusal
of the court to give certain instructions asked by the defendants, and to parts of the charge to the jury
The defendants asked the court to instruct the jury as.
follows
"In all criminal causes the defendant may be found guilty
of any offence the commission of which is necessarily included
in that with which he is charged in the indictment, or the defendant may be found guilty of an attempt to commit the
offence so charged, provided that such attempt be itself a
separate offence." "Under an indictment charging murder,
the defendant may be convicted of murder, of manslaughter,
or an attempt to commit either murder or manslaughter."
"Under the indictment m this case, the defendants may be
convicted of murder, or manslaughter, or of an attempt to
commit murder or manslaughter, and if after a full and
careful consideration of all the evidence before you you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty,
either of manslaughter or of an assault with-intent to commit
murder or manslaughter, you should so find your verdict."
These instructions were refused and the defendants excepted.
In its charge to the jury the court, among other things.,
said "What, then, is murder There are only two kinds of
felonious homicide known to the laws of the United States.
One is murder and the other is manslaughter. There are no
degrees of murder." "There is no definition of murder by
any United States statute. We resort to the common law for
that. By the common law, murder is the unlawful killing of
a human being in the peace of the State, with malice aforethought, either express or implied. Malice, then, is an element in the offence and discriminates it from the other crime
of felonious homicide which I have mentioned, to wit, manslaughter, that is, malice express or implied, discriminates

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

murder from the offence of manslaughter."

"Express malice

exists when one, by deliberate premeditation and design,
formed in advance, to kill or to do bodily harm, the premeditation and design being implied from external circumstances
-capable of proof, such as lying in wait, antecedent threats,
and concerted schemes against a victim. Implied malice is
,an inference of the law from any deliberate and cruel act
committed by one person against another. The two kinds of
malice, therefore, to repeat, indicate but one state of mind,
established in different ways, the one by circumstances showing premeditation of the homicide, the other by an inference
of the law from the act committed, that is, malice is inferred
when one kills another without provocation, or when the provocation is not great. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing
of a human being without malice either expressed or implied.
I do not consider it necessary, gentlemen, to explain it further,
for f a felonqous homaide has been committed, qf whzch you
are to be the judgesfrom the poroqf, there 's nothing in ths case
to reduce zt below the grade of murder In other words, it
may be in the power of the jury under the indictment by
which these defendants are accused and tried of finding them
guilty of a less crime than murder, to wit, manslaughter, or
an attempt to commit murder, yet, as I have said 2n this case,
'f a felonious homzcde has been committed at all, of which I
repeat you are the )udges, there ts nothing to reduce st below
the grade qf murder "
The court further said to the jury
"You are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the
witnesses, and in judging of their credibility you have a right
to take into consideration their prejudices, motives, or feelings
.of revenge, if any such have been proven or shown by the
evidence in the case, if you believe from the evidence that
.any witness or witnesses have knowingly and wilfully testified falsely as to any material fact or point, you are at liberty
to disregard entirely the testimony of such witness or witnesses." "Gentlemen, I have given you these instructions as
carefully as I could, avoiding all references to the testimony,
but I do not wish to be misunderstood, and out of abundant

may appearm any one of these instructions,you are to takethts case and consider st, and remember you are the tribunalto
which the law has referred the- case and whose judgment thelaw wants on the case."
After the jury had been in consultation for a time, they returned into court for further instructions. The colloquy between
the court and the jurors is set forth at large in the margin.'
,,FoRmi:Ax. There isone of us who wishes to be instructed by your
honor as tQ certain points upon the question of United States marine laws
in regard to murder on the high seas.
" CounT. The instruction which I gave you, gentlemen, in regard to.
the law upon which the indictment was based was section 5339 of the Revised Statutes, which I will read to you again. JuRon. Your honor, I
would like to know in regard to the interpretation of the laws of the United
States in regard to manslaughter, as to whether the defendants can be
found guilty of manslaughter, or that the defendants must be found guilty.
"COURT.
I will read the section to you and see if that touches the proposition. The indictment is based upon section 5339, which provides, among
other things, 'that every' person who commits murder upon the high seas
or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven, creek, basin, or bay, within
the admiralty and maritime 3urisdiction of the United States and out of the
jurisdiction of any particular State, or who, upon any such waters, maliciously strikes, stabs, wounds, poisons, ' or shoots any other person, of
which striking, stabbing, wounding, poisoning, or shooting such other
person dies on land or at sea, within or without the United States, shall
suffer death. Hence, that is the penalty for the offence described in the
indictment. I have given you the definition of murder. If you remember
it, you will connect it with these words. 'Every person who commits
murder upon the high seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven,
etc. JUROR. Are the two words ' aiding' or abetting' defined ? CouRT.
The words 'aiding' or 'abetting' are not defined, but I have instructed you
as to the legal effect of aiding and abetting, and this you should accept as
law. If I have made an error there is a higher tribunal to correct it.
"JuRoR. I am the spokesman for two oi us. We desire to clearly
understand the matter. It is a barrier in our mind to our determining the
matter. The question arising amongst us is as to aiding and abetting.

have given you. I will read them to you again, so as to be careful and
that you may understand. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human

recall'my definition to your minds. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing
of a human being without malice, either express or implied. I do not con.
sider it necessary to explain it further. If a felonious homicide has been committed by either of the defendants, of which you are to be the judges from the
proof, there is nothing in this case to reduce it below the grade of murder.
" JUROR. Then, as I understand your honor clearly, there is nothing
about manslaughter in this court ' COURT. No; I do not wish to be so
understood. A verdict must be based on evidence, and in a proper case a
verdict for manslaughter may be rendered.

that manslaughter or murder has been committed. That is for you gentlemen to determine from the testimony and the instructions I have given

where persons are being tried upon a charge of murder, and the facts proven
at their trial show that the defendants are guilty of manslaughter, under an
indictment, they may find him guilty of manslaughter, as a general rule;
but, however, if the facts show that the defendants have been guilty of
murder, and that, in this case, there is no evidence tending to establish the

be rendered, as the district attorney has stated, and even in this case you
have the physical power to do so- but as one of the tribunals of the country,

States, providing that "in all criminal causes the defendant
may be found guilty of any offence the commission of which
is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the
indictment, or may be found guilty of an attempt to commit
the offence so charged. Proowded, That such attempt be
itself a separate offence."
The refusal to grant the defendants' requests for instructions, taken in connection with so much of the charge as
referred to the crime of manslaughter, and the observations
of the court when the jury through their foreman applied for
further instructions, present the question whether the court
transcended its authority when saying, as in effect it did,
that in view of the evidence the only verdict the jury could
under the law properly render would be either one of guilty
of the offence charged or one of not guilty of the offence
charged, that if a felonious homicide had been committed by
either of the defendants, of whwh the jury were the judges
from the yroof, there was nothing in this case to reduce it
below the grade of murder; and that, "as one of the tribunals of the country, a jury is expected to be governed by law,
and the law it should recemefrom the court."
The court below assumed, and correctly, that section 1035
of the Revised Statutes did not authorize a jury in a criminal
case to find the defendant guilty of a less offence than the one
charged, unless the evidence justified them in so doing. Congress did not intend to invest juries in criminal cases with
power arbitrarily to disregard the evidence and the principles
of law applicable to the case on trial. The only object of that
section was to enable the jury, in case the defendant was not
shown to be guilty of the particular crime charged, and bf the
evidence permitted them to do so, to find him guilty of a lesser
offence necessarily included in the one charged, or of the
offence of attempting to commit the one charged. Upon a
careful scrutiny of the evidence, we cannot find any ground
whatever upon which the jury could properly have reached
the conclusion that the defendant Hansen was only guilty of
au offence included in the one charged, or of a mere attempt
to commit the offence charged. A verdict of guilty of an

OCTOBER TER-M, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

offence less than the one charged would have been in flagrant
disregard of all the proof, and m violation by the jury of their
obligation to render a true verdict. There was an entire absence of evidence upon which to rest a verdict of guilty of
manslaughter or of simple assault. A verdict of that kind
would have been the exercise by the jury of the power to.
commute the punishment for an offence actually committed,,
and thus impose a punishment different from that prescribed
by law
The general question as to the duty of the jury to receive
the law from the court, is not concluded by any direct decision
of this court. But it has been often considered by other courtsand by judges of high authority, and, where its determination
has not been controlled by specific constitutional or statutory
provisions expressly empowering the jury to determine both
law and facts, the principle by which courts and juries are to.
be guided in the exercise of their respective functions has become firmly established. If this be true, this court should not
announce a different rule, unless impelled to do so by reasons
so cogent and controlling that they cannot properly be overlooked or disregarded. Some of the members of this court,
after much consideration and upon an extended review of the
authorities, are of opinion that the conclusion reached by this
court is erroneous both upon principle and authority
For
this reason, and because the question is of great importance in
the adminstration of justice, and also involves human life, we
deem it appropriate to state with more fulness than under
other circumstances would be necessary the grounds upon
which our judgment will rest -looking first to cases determined in the courts of the United States.
In Georgsa v Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1, 4, a case in this court
tried by a special jury upon an amicable issue, Chief Justice
Jay is reported to have said "It may not be amiss here, gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions
of fact it is the province of the jury, on questions of law it is
the province of the court to decide. But it must be observed
that by the same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take

upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as
well as the fact in controversy
On this, and on every other
occasion, however, we have no doubt you will pay that respect which is due to the opimon of the court, for as, on the
one hand, it is presumed that juries are best judges of facts, it
is, on the other hand, presumable that the courts are the best
judges of law But -still both objects are lawfully within
your power of decision." Of the correctness of this report,
Mr. Justice Curtis in United States v 2formrs, I Curtis, 23, 58,
expressed much doubt, for the reason that the Chief Justice is
reported as saying that, in evil cases, and that was a civil
case, the jury had the right to decide the law, and because,
also, the different parts of the charge conflict with each other,
the Chief Justice, according to the report, saying at the outset that it is the province of the jury to decide questions of
fact and of the court to decide questions of law, and in the
succeeding sentence informing the jury that they had the
Pzght to take upon themselves the determination of both law
and fact. If the Chief Justice said that it was the province
of the court to decide questions of law, and the promnce of
The jury to decide questions of fact, he could not have said
that the jury had the right, in a civil case, to judge of and
determine both law and fact. "The whole case," Mr. Justice
Curtis said, "is an anomaly It purports to be a trial by jury
in the Supreme Court of the United States of certain issues
out of chancery And the Chief Justice begins by telling the
jury that the facts are all agreed, and the only question is
a matter of law, and upon that the whole court were agreed.
If it be correctly reported, I can only say it is not in accordance with the views of any other court, so far as I know, in
this country or in England, and is certainly not in accordance
with the course of the Supreme Court for many years."
Certain observations of Chief Justice Marshall in the course
of the trial of Burr have sometimes been referred to in support of the contention that the jury in a criminal case are
under no legal obligation to accept the law as laid down by
the court. But nothing said by him at that trial was inconsistent with the views expressed by eminent jurists in cases

Opinion of the Court.

to be presently cited. In the course of an opinion relating
merely to the order of evidence, the Chief Justice said.
"Levying of war is a fact which must be decided by the
jury The court may give general instructions on this as on
every other question brought before them, but the jury must
decide upon it as compounded of fact and law." 1 Burr's
T ial,170. This language is supposed- to justify the contention that the jury in a criminal case are entitled, of right, to
determine questions of pure law adversely to the direction of
the court. But that no such thought was in the mind of the
Chief Justice is manifest from his written charge to the jury
at a subsequent stage of the trial- the accuracy of the report
of which has never been disputed - in which he discussed,
in the light of the authorities, the question as to what constituted treason.
In the course of that charge he indicated quite distinctly
his view of the respective functions of court and jury "It
has been thought proper," he said, "to discuss this question
at large and. to review the opinion of the Supreme Court, [Ex
parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch, 75,] although this
court would be more disposed to leave the question of fact
whether an overt act of levying war were committed on
Blannerhassett's Island to the jury under this explanation
of the law, and to nstruct them that unless the assemblage
on Blannerhassett's Island was an assemblage in force, was
a military assemblage in a condition to make war, it was not
levying war, and that they could not construe st into an act of
war, than to arrest the further testimony which might be
offered to connect the prisoner with that assemblage, or to
prove the intention of those who assembled together at that
place. This point, however, is not to be understood as decided. It will, perhaps, constitute an essential inquiry in
another case." 2 Burr's TYral, 422. This language is wholly
inconsistent with the theory that the Chief Justice recognized
the right of the jury to disregard the court's view of the law
upon any question arising in the case before them. It was
consistent only with the theory that the court could speak
authoritatively as to the law, while the function of the jury

SPAR]

AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES;
Opinon of the Court.

was to respond as to the facts. Again "It is further the
opinion of the court that there ss no testimony whatever which
tends to prove that the accused was actually or constructively
present when that assemblage did: take place, indeed, the contrary is most apparent." Ib.439. "The opinion of this
court on the order of testimony has frequently been adverted to as deciding this question against the motion. If a
contradiction between the two opinions exist, the court cannot perceive it. It was said that levying war is an act compounded of law and fact, of which the jury, aided by the
court, must judge. To that declaration the court still adheres." Ib.444. He concluded his memorable charge in
these words "The jury have now heard the opinion of the
court on the law of the case. They will apply that law to the
facts, and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own
consciences may direct." Ib.445. Again, according to the
oply recognized report of that trial ever published, the Chief
Justice, in response to certain inquiries of counsel made after
the jury returned their verdict, said
"Without doubt the
court intended to deliver merely a legal opinion as to what
acts amounted in law to an overt act of levying war, and not
whether such an overt act has or has not been proved. It
merely stated the law, to whch the jury would aply thefacts
proved. It is their province to say whether .according to thso
statement and the evidence an overt act has been proved or
not." Ib.448. The language of the Chief Justice plainly
imports that while the jury must of necessity often pass upon
a question, "compounded of fact and law," their duty, when
considering the evidence, was to apply the law, as given by
the court, to the facts proved, and, thus applyzng the law,
return a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their consciences
might direct. If he had believed that the jury were entitled,
of right, whatever might be the views of the court, to determine for themselves the law of the case, it is impossible that
he could have said that "they will apply that law " - the law
as he declared it to be - "to the facts." On the contrary, he
observed that the province of the jury was to determine
whether the accused was guilty or not guilty, according to
his statement of the law as applied to the evidence.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

Of course, this court has no means of determining what
were the views of Chief Justice Marshall, except by referring
to such authorized publications as show what he said while
discharging judicial functions. In none of his opinions delivered at the Circuit Court and published can there be found
anything at all in conflict with his declarations at the trial of
Burr. And it may be observed that the circumstances attending that tnlal were such as to induce him to weigh every word
embodied in his elaborate written charge to the jury That
he understood the gravity of the occasion, so far as it related
to the conduct of the trial, is manifest from his referring in
the following language to certain considerations that had
been advanced in argument "That this court dares not usurp
power is most true. That this court dares not shrink from its
duty is not less true. No man is desirous of placing himself
in a disagreeable situation. No man is desirous of becoming
the peculiar subject of calumny iNo man, might he let the
bitter cup pass from him without self-reproach, would drain it
to the bottom. But if he had no choice in the case, if there
be no alternative presented to him but a dereliction of duty
or the opprobrium of those who are denominated the world,
he merits the contempt as well as the indignation of his
country who can hesitate which to embrace. That gentlemen, in a case the most interesting, in the zeal with which
they advocate particular opinions, and under the conviction in
some measure produced by that zeal, should on each side
press their arguments too far, should be impatient at any
deliberation in the court, and should suspect or fear the operation of motives to which alone they can ascribe that deliberation, is perhaps a frailty incident to human nature, but, if
any conduct on the part of the court could warrant a sentiment that it would deviate to the one side or the other from
the line prescribed by duty and by law, that conduct would
be viewed by the judges themselves with an eye of extreme
severity, and would long be recollected with deep and serious
regret," pp. 444, 445.
In Henfield's case, Mr. Justice Wilson, with whom sat Mr.
Justice Iredell, stated that the jury, in a general verdict, must

Opinion of the Court.

decide both law and fact, but that "this did not authorize
them to decide it as they pleased," and that "the questions of
law coming into go?.nt consderation with the facts, it is the
duty of the court to explain the law to the jury, and give it to
them =n directwn." Wharton's State Trials, 48, 84. This
statement of the principle is sometimes referred to in support
of the proposition that the jury is not under a legal duty to
accept the law as declared by the court in a criminal case.
We think it tends to show that it is the province and duty of
the jury to apply to the facts of the case the law as given to
them by the court "in direction."
There is nothing in conflict with this in the lectures on law
delivered by Mr. Justice Wilson. In one of those lectures, referring to the duties of jurors in criminal cases, he said "On
questions of law, his [the juror's] deficiencies will be supplied
by the professional directions of the judges, whose duty and
whose bustness it ts professwnally to direct him. For, as we
have seen, verdicts, in criminal cases, generally determine the
question of law as well as the question of fact. Questions of
fact it is his exclusive province to determine. With the consideration of evidence unconnected with the question which he
isto try, his attention will not be distracted, for everything
of that nature, we presume, will be excluded by the court.
The collected powers of his mind, therefore, will be fixed,
steadily and without interruption, upon the issue which he is
sworn to try Tk'ts issue is an issue of fact." 2 Wilson's
Works, 386. Other observations found in these lectures, if
considered alone, are not so explicit upon the question of the
respective functions of court and jury; but taken in connection
with all that he said, it is reasonably clear that when Mr. Justice Wilson spoke of the determination by a jury, in a criminal
case, of both law and fact, he meant only that a general verdict of guilty or not guilty, of necessity, decided every question before them which involved a jotnt consideration of law
and fact, not that the jury could ignore the directions of the
court, and take the law into their own hands.
The observations of Mr. Justice Samuel Ohase in the case of
John Fries,tried for treason, in 1800, are supposed to sustain

Opinion of the Court.

the broad proposition that the jury may, of right, disregard
the law as expounded by the court. He undoubtedly did say
that while it was the duty of the court, in all criminal cases,
to state the law arising on the facts, the jury were to decide
"both the law and the facts, on their consideration of the
whole case." Chase's Trial, App. 44. But on the trial, in
the same year, in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Virginia District, of James Thompson Callender for sedi-

tious libel, Wharton's State Trials, 688, he was appalled at the
suggestion by learned counsel that the jury were entitled, of
right, to determine the constitutional validity of the act of
Congress under which the accused was indicted. Mr. Wirt,
counsel for the defendant, said "Since, then, the jury have a
right to consider the law, and since the Constitution is law,
the conclusion is certainly syllogistic that the jury have a
right to consider the Constitution." Ib. 710. But Mr. Justice
Chase declined to accept this view He said "The statute on
which the traverser is indicted enacts ' that the jury who shall
try the cause shall have a right to determine the law and the
fact, under the direction of the court, as 2n other cases.' By
this provision I understand that a right is given to the jury to
determine what the law is in the case before them, and not to
decide whether a statute of the United States produced to them
is a law or not, or whether it is void, under an opinion that it
is unconstitutional, that is, contrary to the Constitution of the
United States. I admit that the jury are to compare the statute with the facts proved, and then to decide whether the acts
done are prohibited by the law, and whether they amount to
the offence described in the indictment. This power the jury
necessarily possesses, in order to enable them to decide on the
guilt or innocence of the person accused. It is one thing to
decide what the law is on the facts proved, and another and a
very different thing to determine that the statute produced is
no law To decide what the law is on the facts, is an admission that the law exists. If there be no law in the case there
can be no comparison between it and the facts, and it is unnecessary to establish facts before it is ascertained that there
is a law to punish the commission of them." Ib. 713.

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

"It was never pretended," he continued, "as I ever heard,
before this time, that a petit jury in England (from whence
our common law is derived) or in any part of the United States,
ever exercised such power. If a petit jury can rightfully exercise this power over one statute of Congress, they must have
an equal right and power over any other statute, and indeed
over all the statutes, for no line can be drawn, no restriction

-nposed on the exercise of such power, it must rest in discretion-only If this power be ence admitted, petit jurors will be
superior to the national legislature, and its laws will be subject
to their control. The power to abrogate or to make laws nugatory is equal to the authority of making them. The evident
consequences of this right in juries will be, that a law of Congress will be in operation in one State and not in another. A
law to impose taxes will be obeyed in one State, and not in
another, unless force be employed to compel submission. The
doing of certain acts will be held criminal, and pumshed in
one State, and similar acts may be held innocent, and even
approved and applauded in another. The effects of the exercise of this power by petit jurors may be readily conceived. It
appears to me that the right now claimed has a direct tendency to dissolve the Union of the United States, on which,
under divine Providence, our political safety, happiness, and
prosperity depend." Ib. 714. He concluded his opinion in
these words: "I consider it of the greatest consequence to the
administration of justice that the powers of the court and the
powers of the petit jury should be kept distinct and separate.
I have uniformly delivered the opinion 'that the petit jury
have a right to decide the law as well as the fact in criminal
cases,' but it never entered into my mind that they, therefore, had a right to determine the constitutionality of any statute of the United States." Ib. '718.
What Mr. Justice Chase said is quite sufficient to show the
mischievous consequences that would flow from the doctrine
that the jury may, of right, disregard the directions of the
court, and determine the law for themselves. For if, as ia
contended, the jury in criminal cases are not bound to take
the laW from the court, it is impossible to deny their absolute

Opinion of the Court.

right in a case depending entirely upon an act of Congress, or
a statute of a State, to determine, upon their own responsibility, whether that act or statute is or is not law, that is,
whether it is or is not in violation of the Constitution.
Mr. Justice Thompson, who became a member of this court
in 1823, concurred in the opinion delivered by Kent, J., in
People v C'oswell, (1804,) 3 Johns. Cas. 337, 362, where the
court was equally divided, Chief Justice Lewis and Judge
Brockholst Livingston, afterwards a Justice of this .court,
holding that to questions of law the court, to questions of
fact the jury, must respond. But in his opinion in Pierce v
State, 13 N. H. 536, 564, Chief Justice Parker, referring to
Judge Kent's opinion in People v. Croswell, said. "'Mr. Justice
Thompson, who concurred in that opinion, must have understood that concurrence to be merely in the points necessary to
the decision of that cause, or have subsequently changed his
views, for I have his authority for saying that he has repeatedly ruled that the jury are not judges of the law in criminal
cases." And in the dissenting opinion of Judge Bennett in
State v Croteau, 23 Vermont, 14, 63, (where it was held that
the jury, in criminal cases, could rightfully decide questions
of both law and fact, but which case has been overruled, 65
Vermont 1, 34,) it was said "Judge Thompson, whose judicial learning and experience, while on the bench of the Supreme Court of New York, and on the bench of the United
States, were very extensive, thus wrote to a friend some short
time before his death ' I have repeatedly ruled on the trial
of criminal cases, that it was the r, ght as well as the duty of
the court to decide questions of law, and any other rule, it
appears to me, would be at war with our whole judicial system, and introduce the utmost confusion in criminal trials.
It is true, the jury may disregard the instructions of the court,
and in some cases there may be no remedy But it is still the
right of the court to instruct the jury on the law, and the
duty of the jury to obey the instructions.'" See also Wharton's Cr. Pl. & Pr. § 810, note 3.
The remarks of Mr. Justice Baldwin in Unzted States v
Wilson and Porter,1 Baldwin, 78, 100, 108, have sometimes

been referred to as in conflict with the rule that it is the duty
of the jury to accept the law as expounded by the court. It
is quite true that in the charge in Wilson's case, Mr. Justice
:Baldwin said that if the. jury were prepared to say that the
law was different from what the court had announced, they
were in the exercise of their constitutional right to do so.
But in his charge in Porters case, he explained what was
said in Wilson's case. After remarking, that if a jury find a
prisoner guilty against the court's opinion of the law of the
-case, a new trmal would be granted, as no court would proinounce a judgment on a prisoner against what it believes to
Ibe the law, he said "This, then, you will understand to be what
,is
meant by your power to decide on the law, but you will still
bear in mind that it is a very old, sound, and valuable maxim
-in law that the court answers to questions of law, and the
.juryto facts. Every day's experience evinces the wisdom of
this rule." Subsequently in Urnsted States v. ShAve, I Baldwin, 510, 513, which was an indictment for passing a counter-feit note of the Bank of the United States, and when the
-question arose as to the right of the jury to pass upon the con:stitutionality of the act of Congress on which the prosecution was founded, Mr. Justice Baldwin said, in his charge "If
jurses once exercise th power, we arewithout a Constitutonor
laws, one jury has the same power as another, you cannot bind
those who may take your places, what you declare constitutional to-day another jury may declare unconstitutional to-morrow"
The question before us received full consideration by Mr.
Justice Story in United States v Batt-iste, 2 Sumner, 240, 243,
•244. That was an indictment for a capital offence, and the
-question was directly presented whether in criminal cases,
especially in capital cases, the jury were the judges of the law
as well as of the facts. He said "My opinion is that the
jury are no more judges of the law in a capital or other criminal case, upon the plea of not guilty, than they are in every
civil case tried upon the general issue. In each of these cases,
their verdict, when general, is necessarily compounded of law
and of fact, and includes both. In each they must necessarily

Opinion of the Court.

determine the law as well as the fact. In each they have the
physical power to disregard the law, as laid down to them by
the court. But I deny that, in any case, civil or criminal,
they have the moral right to decide the law according to their
own notions or pleasure. On the contrary, I hold it the most
sacred constitutional right of every party accused of a crime
that the jury should respond as to the facts, and the court as to
the law It is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to
the law and it is the duty of the jury to follow the law as it is.
laid down by the court. This is the right of every citizen, and
it is his only protection. If the jury were at liberty to settle
the law for themselves, the effect would be, not only that the
law itself would be most uncertain, from the different views
which different juries might take of it, but in case of error
there would be no remedy or redress by the injured party, for
the court would not have any right to review the law as it had
been settled by the jury
Every person accused as a criminal has a right to be tried according to the law of the land,
the fixed law of the land and not by the law as a jury may
understand it, or choose, from wantonness or ignorance or
accidental mistake, to interpret it. If I thought that the jury
were the proper judges of the law in criminal cases, I should
hold it my duty to abstain from the responsibility of stating
the law to them upon any such trial. But believing, as I do,,
that every citizen has a right to be tried by the law, and
according to the law, that it is his privilege and truest shield
against oppression and wrong, I feel it my duty to state my
views fully and openly on the present occasion."
In United States v Morris, 1 Curtis, 23, 52-58, the question, in all of its aspects, was examined by Mr. Justice Curtis
with his accustomed care. In that case the contention was
that every jury, impanelled in a court of the United States,
was the rightful judge of the existence, construction, and effect
of every law that was material in a criminal case, and could,
of right, and if it did its duty must, decide finally on the constitutional validity of any act of Congress which the trial brought
in question. Touching the rightful powers and duties of the
court and the jury under the Constitution in criminal cases,

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opimon of the Court.

Mr. Justice Curtis, among other things, said "The sixth
article, after declaring that the Constitution, laws, and treaties
of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land,
proceeds, ' and the judges, in every State, shall be bound thereby' But was it not intended that the Constitution, laws, and
treaties of the United States should be the supreme law in
cnuntnal as well as in. onil cases 2 If a state law should make
it penal for an officer of the United States to do what an act
of Congress commands him to do, was not the latter to be
supreme over the former 2 And if so, and in such cases, juries
finally and rightfully determine the law, and the Constitution
so means when it speaks of a trial by jury, why was this -command laid on the judges alone, who are thus mere advisers of
the jury, and may be bound to give sound advice, but have no
real power in the matter 2 It was evidently the intention of
the Constitution that all persons engaged in making, expounding, and executing the laws, not only under the authority of
the United States but of the several States, should be bound
by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution of the
United States. But no such oath or affirmation is required of
jurors, to whom it is alleged the Constitution confides the
power of expounding that instrument, and not only construing, but holding invalid any law which may come m question
on a criminal trial." "In my opinion," the learned justice
proceeded, "it is the duty of the court to decide every question of law which aiises in a criminal trial, if the question
touches any matter affecting the course of the trial, such as the
competency of a witness, the admissibility of evidence, and
the like, the jury receive no direction concerning it, it affects
the materials out of which they are to form their verdict, but
they have no more concern with it than they would have had
if the question had arisen in some other trial. If the question
of law enters into the issue, and forms part of it, the jury are
to be told what the law is, and they are bound to consider that
they are told truly, that law they apply to the facts, as they
find them, and thus, passing both on the law and the fact,
they, from both, frame their general verdict of guilty or not
guilty Such is my view of the respective duties of the differ-

ent parts of this tribunal in tne trial of criminal cases, and I
have not found a single decision of any court in England, prior
to the formation of the Constitution, which conflicts with it."
It was also contended that the clause in the act of Congress,
known as the Sedition Law of July 14, 1798, c. 74, § 3, 1 Stat.
596, 597, declaring that "the jury who shall try the cause shall
have a right to determine the law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other cases," implied that the jury
"in other cases" might decide the law contrary to the direction of the court. But in response to this view Mr. Justice
Curtis said "I draw from this the opposite inference, for
where was the necessity of this provision if, by force of the
Constitution, juries, as such, have both the power and the
right to determine all questions in criminal cases, and why
are they to be directed by the court 2" See also .Montgome7y
v State, 11 Ohio, 427.
But Mr. Justice Curtis considered the question from another
point of view, and gave reasons which appear to us entirely
conclusive against the proposition that it is for the jury, in
every criminal case, to say authoritatively what is the law by
which they are to be governed in finding their verdict. He
said "There is, however, another act of Congress which bears
directly on this question. The act of the 29th of April, 1802,
in section 6, after enacting that, in case of a division of opinion between the judges of the Circuit Court on any question,
such question may be certified to the Supreme Court, proceeds, ' and shall by the said court be finally decided. And
the decision of the Supreme Court and their order in the
premises shall be remitted to the Circuit Court and be there
entered of record and have effect according to the nature of
such judgment and order.' The residue of this section proves
that criminal as well as civil cases are embraced in it, and
under it many questions arising in criminal cases have been
certified to and decided by the Supreme Court, and persons
have been executed by reason of such decisions. Now, can it
be that, after a question arising in a criminal trial has been
certified to the Supreme Court, and there, in the language of
this act, finally decided, and their order remitted here and en-

tered of record, that when the trial comes on the jury may
rightfully revise and reverse this final decision 2 Suppose, in
the course of this trial, the judges had divided in opinion upon
the question of the constitutionality of the act of 1850, and
that, after a final decision thereon by the Supreme Court and
the receipt of its mandate here, the trial should come on before a jury, does the Constitution of the United States, which
established that Supreme Court, intend that a jury may, as
matter of right, revise and reverse that decision 2 And, if
not, what becomes of this supposed right? Are the decisions
of the Supreme Court binding on juries, and not the decisions
of inferior courts 2 This will hardly be pretended, and if it
were, how is it to be determined whether the -Supreme Court
has or has not, in some former case, in effect settled a particular question of law 2 In my judgment this act of Congress
is in accordance with the Constitution, and designed to effect
one of its important and even necessary objects - a uniform
exposition and interpretation of the law of the United States
-by
providing means for a final decision of any question of
law, final as respects every tribunal and every part of any
tribunal in the country, and if so, it is not only wholly inconsistent with the alleged power of juries, to the extent of all
questions so decided, but it tends strongly to prove that no
such right as is claimed does or can exist."
Again. "Considering the intense interest excited, the talent
and learning employed, and consequently the careful researches
made, in England, near the close of the last century, when the
law of libel was under discussion in the courts and in Parliament, it cannot be doubted that, if any decision, having the
least weight, could have been produced in support of the general proposition, that juries are judges of the law in criminal
cases, it would then have been brought forward. I am not
aware that any such was produced. And the decision of the
Kingo's Bench in Rlex v The Dean of St. Asaph, 3 T. R. 428,
and the answers of the twelve judges to the questions propounded by the Rouse of Lords, assume as a necessary postulate, what Lord Mansfield so clearly declares in terms, that,
by the law of England, juries cannot rightfully decide a ques-

tion of law Passing over what was said by ardent partisans
and eloquent counsel, it will be found that the great contest,
concerning what is known as Mr. Fox's Libel Bill, was carried
on upon quite a different ground by its leading friends, a
ground which, while it admits that the jury are not to decide
the law, denies that the libellous intent is matter of law, and
asserts that it is so mixed with the fact that, under the general
issue, it is for the jury to find it as a fact. 34 An. Reg. 110,
29 Parl. His. Debates in the Lords. Such I understand to be
the effect of that famous declaratory law 32 Geo. 3, c. 60.
I conclude, then, that when the Constitution of the
United States was founded, it was a settled rule of the
common law that, in criminal as well as civil cases, the court
decided the law, and the jury the facts, and it cannot be
doubted that this must have an important effect in determining what is meant by the Constitution when it adopts a trial
by jury"
That eminent jurist, whose retirement from judicial station
has never ceased to be a matter of deep regret to the bench
and bar of this country, closed his great opinion with an
expression of a firm conviction that, under the Constitution of
the United States, juries in criminal cases have not the right
to decide any question of law, and that, in rendering a general
verdict, their duty and their oath require them to apply to the
facts, as they find them, the law given to them by the court.
And in so declaring he substantially repeated what Chief
Justice Marshall had said in Burr's case.
In United States v Greathouse, 4 Sawyer, 45-7, 464, which
was an indictment for treason, Mr. Justice Field said. "There
prevails a very general, but an erroneous, opinion that in all
criminal cases the jury are the judges as well of the law as
of the fact-that is, that they have the right to disregard the
law as laid down by the court, and to follow their own notions
on the subject. Such is not the right of .the jury" "It is
their duty to take the law from the court and apply it to the
facts of the case. It is the province of the court, and of
the court alone, to determine all questions of law arising in
the progress of a trial, and it is the province of the jury to

SPARF AlND EANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

pass upon the evidence and determine all contested questions
of fact. The responsibility of deciding correctly as to the law
rests solely with the court, and the responsibility of finding
correctly the facts rests solely with the jury"
These principles were applied by Judge Shipman in Un ted
State v _iley, 5 Blatchford, 201, and by Judge Cranch, upon
an extended review of the authorities, in &Stettinzusv United
States, 5 Cranch C. C. 573. They were also applied by Judge
Jackson, in the District of West Virginia, in Vt47ted States v
Keller, 19 Fed. Rep. 633, m which case it was said that
although an acquittal in a criminal case was final, even if the
jury arbitrarily disregarded the instructions of the court on
the law of the case, a jury, in order to discharge its whole
duty, must take the law from the court and apply it to the
facts of the case.
Turmng now to cases in the state courts, we find that in
Commonwealth v Porter, 10 Met. (Mass.) 263, 276, the Supreme Judicial Court of- Massachusetts, speaking by Chief
Justice Shaw delivering the unanimous judgment of the court
composed of himself and Justices Wilde, Dewey, and Hubbard,
held that it was a well-settled principle, lying at the foundation of jury trials, admitted and recognized ever since jury
trial had been adopted as an established and settled mode of
proceeding in courts of justice, that it was the proper province
and duty of judges to consider and decide all questions of law,
and the proper province and duty of the jury to decide all
questions of fact. In the same case, the court, observing that
the safety, efficiency, and purity of jury trial depend upon the
steady maintenance and practical application of this principle,
and adverting to the fact that a jury, in rendering a general
verdict, must necessarily pass upon the whole issue, compounded of the law and of the fact, and thus snmcdentally
pass on questions of law, said "It is the duty of the court to
instruct the jury on all questions of law which appear to arise
in the cause, and also upon all questions, pertinent to the
issue, upon which either party may request the direction of
the court upon matters of law And it is the duty of the jury
to receive the law from the court, and to conform their judg-

ment and decision to such instructions, as far as they understand them, in applying the law to the facts to be found by
them, and it is not within the legitimate province of the jury
to revise, reconsider, or decide contrary to such .opinion or
direction of the court in matter of law" p. 286.
Perhaps the fullest examination of the question upon principle, as well as upon authority, to be found in the decisions
of any state court, was made in Conmonwealtk v Antkes, 5
Gray, 185, 208, 218, where Chief Justice Shaw, speaking for
a majority of the court, said that the true theory and fundamental principle of the common law, both in its civil and
criminal departments, was, that the judges should adjudicate
finally, upon the whole question of law, and the jury upon
the whole question of fact.
Considering, in the light of the authorities, the grounds upon
which a verdict of guilty or not guilty, in a criminal case, was
held, at common law, to be conclusive, he observed that though
the jury have the power they had not the right to decide, that
is, to adjudicate on both law and evidence. He said "The
result of these several rules and principles is, that, in practice,
the verdict of a jury, both upon the law and the fact, is conclusive, because, from the nature of the proceeding, there is
no judicial power by which the conclusion of law thus brought
upon the record by that verdict can be reversed, set aside, or
inquired into. A general verdict, either of conviction or acquittal, does embody and declare the result of both the law
and the fact, and there is no mode of separating them on the
record so as to ascertain whether the jury passed their judgment on the law or only on the evidence. The law authorized
them to adjudicate definitively on the evidence, the law presumes that they acted upon correct rules of law given them
by the judge, the verdict therefore stands conclusive and
unquestionable, in point both of law and fact. In a certain
limited sense, therefore, it may be said that the jury have a
power and a legal right to pass upon both the law and the
fact. And this is sufficient to account for many and most of
the dicta in which the proposition is stated. But it would be
more accurate to state, that it is the right of the jury to return

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

a general verdict, this draws after it, as a necessary consequence, that they snedentally pass upon the law But here
again is the question, what is intended by 'passing upon the
law 21' I think it is by embracing it in their verdict, and thus
bringing it upon the record, with their finding of the facts.
But does it follow that they may rightfully and by authority
of the common law, by which all are conscientiously bound to
govern their conduct, proceed upon the same grounds and
principles in the one case as the other 2 What the jury have
a right to do, and what are the grounds and principles upon
which they are in duty and conscience bound to act and govern themselves in the exercise of that right, are two very distinct questions. The latter is the one we have to deal with.
Suppose they have a right to find a general verdict, and by
that verdict to conclude the prosecutor in the matter of law,
still it is an open and very different question, whether, in makng up that verdict and thereby embracing the law, they have
the same right to exercise their own reason and judgment,
against the statement of the law by the judge, to adjudicate
on the law, as unquestionably they have on the fact. The
affirmative of this proposition is maintained by the defendant
in this case, and by others in many of the cases before us. If
I am right in the assumption that the judge is to adjudge the
law and the jury the fact only, it furnishes the answer to this
question, to what extent the jury adjudicate the law, and it
is, that they receive authoritative directions from the court,
and act in conformity with them, though by their verdict they
thus embrace the law with the fact, which they may rightfully
adjudicate."
Alluding to the history of this question in England, and particularly, as did Mr. Justice Curtis, to the controversy in Iing
v. Dean of St. Asavh, 3 T. R. 428, and which resulted in the
passage by Parliament, after the separation of this country
from Great Britain, of the Libel Act, 32 G. 3, and observing
that both parties to that controversy assumed the force and
existence of the rule as the ancient rule of the common law,
the court said "The court and high prerogative party say,
judges answer to the law and jurors to the fact, the question

of guilty or not, in the peculiar form of a criminal prosecution
for libel, after the jury have found the fact of publication and
truth of the innuendoes, is a question of law, and therefore
must be declared exclusively by the court. The popular party,
assuming the same major proposition, say, the question of
guilty or not is a question of fact, and can be found only by
the jury It appears to me, therefore, as I stated on the outset, that considering the course of the controversy, the earnestness and ability with which every point was contested, and the
thorough examination of the ancient authorities, this concurrence of views on the point in question affords strong proof
that, up to the period of our separation from England, the
fundamental definition of trials by jury depended on the urn
versal maxim, without an exception, ad qucestonemfactb respondenty
juratores, ad qucestzonem y urs respondent yudices."
The Anthes case, it may be observed, arose under a statute
enacted in 1855, after the decision in the Porter case. But
the court held that that statute did not confer upon juries, in
criminal trials, the power of determining questions of law
against the instructions of the court. And the Chief Justice
said - Justices Metcalf and Merrick concurring - that if the
statute could be so interpreted as to prescribe that the jury,
consistently with their duty, may decide the law upon their
judgment contrary to the decision and instruction of the court
before whom the trial was had, such enactment would be
beyond the scope of legitimate legislative power, repugnant
to the Constitution, and, of course, inoperative and void. See
also Commonwealth v Rock, 10 Gray, 4, where the doctrines
announced in Commonwealth v Anthes were reaffirmed, no
one of the members of the court expressing a dissent.
This question was also fully considered in Montee v Commonwealth, 3 J J Marsh. 132, 149, 151, in which case Chief
Justice Robertson said
"The Circuit Judge would be a
cypher, and a criminal trial before him a farce, if he had no
right to decide all questions of law which might arise in the
progress of the case. The jury are the exclusive judges of
the facts. In this particular they cannot be controlled, and
ought not to be instructed by the court. They are, also, ex

necessztate, the ultimate judges, in one respect, of the*law,

"If
soever they have misconceived or disregarded the law"
the court had no right to decide on the law, error, confusion,
uncertainty, and licentiousness would characterize the criminal
trials, and the safety of the accused might be as much endangered as the stability of public justice would certainly be."
In Poeice v State, 13 N. H=. 536, 554, it was held to be inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution that questions of
law, and still less, questions of constitutional law, should be
decided by the verdict of the jury, contrary to the instructions
of the court.
In -Duffy v People, 26 N. Y 588, 592, Judge Selden,
speaking for the Court of Appeals of New York, said "The
unquestionable power of juries to find general verdicts, involving both law and fact, furnishes the foundation for the opinion
that they are judges of the law, as well as of the facts, and
cives some plausibility to that opinion. They are not, however, compelled to decide legal questions, having the right to
find special verdicts, giving the facts, and leaving the legal
conclusions, which result from such facts, to the court. When
they find general verdicts, I think it is their duty to be governed by the instructions of the court as to all legal questions
involved in such verdicts. They have the power to do otherwise, but the exercise of such power cannot be regarded as
rightful, although the law has provided no means, in criminal
cases, of reviewing their decisions whether of law or fact, or
of ascertaining the grounds upon which their verdicts are
based." See also People v -Finnegan,1 Parker's Cr. Cas.
147, 152, Safford v People, 1 Parker's Or. Cas. 474, 480.
So in Hamilton v People, 29 Michigan, 173, 192, Mr. Justice
Campbell, as the organ of the court, said "We understand
the uniform practice and the decided weight of opinion to
require that the judge give his views of the law to the jury as
authority, and not as a matter to be submitted to their review"
And in People v. Anderson, 44 California, 65, '0 "In this
State it is so well settled as no longer to be open to debate,
that it is the duty of a jury in a criminal case to take the law
from the court."

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

Tho principle was accurately stated by Chief Justice Ames,
speaking for the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, when he
said "The line between the duties of a court and jury in the
trial of causes at law, both civil and criminal, is perfectly well
defined, and the rigid observance of it is of the last importance to the administration of systematic justice. Whilst, on
the one hand, the jury are the sole ultimate judges of the
facts, they are, on the other, to receive the law applicable to
the case before them solely from the publicly given instructions of the court. In this way court and jury are made responsible, each in its appropriate department, for the part
taken by each in the trial and decision of causes, and in this
way alone can errors of fact and errors of law be traced, for
the purpose of correction, to their proper sources. If the jury
can receive the law of a case on trial in any other mode than
from the instructions of the court given in the presence of
parties and counsel, how are their errors of law, with any certainty, to be detected, and how, with any certainty, therefore,
to be corrected 2 It is a statute right of parties here, followlng, too, the ancient course of the common law, to have the
law given by the court, in their presence, to the jury, to guide
their decision, in order that every error in matter of law may
be known and corrected." State v Smith, 6 R. I. 33, 34.
In Pennsylvania, in the case of Commonwealth v Sherry,
(reported in the Appendix to Wharton on Homicide, pp. 481,
482) Judge Rogers, a jurist of high reputation, thus charged the
jury in a capital case "You are, it is true, judges in a criminal case, in one sense, of both law and fact, for your verdict,
as in civil cases, must pass on law and fact together. If you
acquit, you interpose a final bar to a second prosecution, no
matter how entirely your verdict may have been in opposition
to the views expressed by the court.
It is important
for you to keep this distinction in mind, remembering that,
while you have the physical power, by an acquittal, to discharge a defendant from further prosecution, you have no
moral power to do so against the law laid down by the court.
For your part, your duty is to receive the law, for the
purposes of this trial, from the court. If an error injurious to

Opinion of the Court.

the prisoner occurs, it will be rectified by the revision of the
court sn banu. But an error resulting from either a conviction or acquittal, against the law, can never be rectified. In
the first case, an unnecessary stigma is affixed to the character
of a man who was not guilty of the offence with which he is
charged. In the second case, a serious injury is effected by
the arbitrary and irremediable discharge of a guilty man.
You will see from these considerations the great importance
of the preservation, in criminal as well as in civil cases, of the
maxim that the law belongs to the court and the facts to the
jury" About the same time Judge Sergeant charged a jury
"The point, if you believe the evidence on both sides, is one
of law, on which it is your duty to receive the instructions of
the court. If you believe the evidence in the whole case, you
must find the defendant guilty" Commonwealth v Vanssklee,
Brightly, (Penn.,) 69, 73, 75. To the same effect substantially
was the language of Chief Justice Gibson, who, when closing
a charge in a capital case, said "If the evidence on these
points fail the prisoner, the conclusion of his guilt will be irresistible, and it will be your duty to draw it." Commonwealth
v. llarman, 4 Penn. St. 269. In a more recent case, .Kane v
Commonwealth, 89 Penn. St. 522, Sharswood, C. J., said that
the power of the jury to judge of the law in a criminal case
was one of the most valuable securities guaranteed by the bill
of rights of Pennsylvania. But in a later case, Nicholson v
Commonwealth, 96 Penn. St. 503, 505, it was said. "The court
had an undoubted right to instruct the jury as to the law, and
to warn them as they did against finding contrary to it. This
is very different from telling them that they must find the defendant guilty, which is what is meant by a binding instruction in criminal cases." In Commonwealth v. .A.Manus, 143
Penn. St. 64, 85, it was adjudged that the statement by the court
was the best evidence of the law within the reach of the jury,
and that the jury should be guided by what the court said as
to the law And this view the court, speaking by Chief Justice
Paxson, said was in harmony with Eane v Commonwealth.
The question has recently been examined by the Supreme
Court of Vermont, and after an elaborate review of the

authorities, English and American, that court, by a unaminous judgment -overruling State v Croteau, 23 Vermont,
14, and all the previous cases which had followed that case
- said "We are thus led to the conclusion that the doctrine
that jurors are the judges of the law in criminal cases is untenable, that it is contrary to the fundamental maxims of
the common law from which it is claimed to take its origin,
contrary to the uniform practice and decisions of the courts
of Great Britain, where our jury system had its beginning,
and where it matured, contrary to the great weight of
authority in this country, contrary to the spirit and meaning of the Constitution of the United States, repugnant to
the constitution of this State, repugnant to our statute relative to the reservation of questions of law in criminal cases
and passing the same to the Supreme Court for final decision."
State v Burpee, 65 Vermont, 1, 34.
These principles are supported by a very large number of
adjudications, as will be seen by an examination of the cases
cited in the margin.'
To the same purport are the text writers. "In theory,
therefore," says Judge Cooley, "the rule of law would seem
to be, that it is the duty of the jury to receive and follow the
law as delivered to them by the court, and such is the clear
weight of authority" Const. Lim. 323, 324. Greenleaf, in

tions on the admissibility of evidence to the jury, as well as
to instruct them in the rules of law, by which it is to be
weighed. Whether there be any evidence or not is a question for the judge, whether it is sufficient evidence is a question for the jury" " Where the question is mixed, consisting
of law and fact, so intimately blended as not to be easily susceptible of separate decision, it is submitted to the jury, who
are first instructed by the judge in the principles and rules of
law, by which they are to be governed in finding a verdict,
and these instructions they are bound to follow" Vol. 1,
§ 49. Starkie, in his treatise on Evidence, observes "Where
the jury find a general verdict they are bound to apply the
law as delivered by the court, in criminal as well as civil
cases." p. 816. So in Phillips on Evidence "They [the
jury] are not in general, either in civil or criminal cases,
judges of the law They are bound to find the law as it is
propounded to them by the court. They may, indeed, find a
general verdict, including both law and fact, but if, in such
verdict, they find the law contrary to the instructions of the
court, they thereby violate their oath." Vol. 3, Hill & Cowen's Notes, part 2, 1501. See also 1 Taylor on Ev §§ 21 to
24, 1 Best's Ev. Morgan's ed. § 82.
In 1 Crim. Law Mag. 51 will be found a valuable note to
the case of Kane v Conlmonwealth, prepared by Mr. Wharton,
in which the authorities are fully examined, and in which he
says "It would be absurd to say that the determination of
the law belongs to the jury, not court, if the court has power
to set" aside that which the jury determines. We must hold,
to enable us to avoid the inconsistency, that, subject to the
qualification that all acquittls are final, the law in criminal
cases is to be determined by the court. In this way we have
our liberties and rights determined, not by an irresponsible,
but by a responsible, tribunal, not by a tribunal ignorant of
the law, but by a tribunal trained to and disciplined by the
law , not by an irreversible tribunal, but by a reversible tribunal, not by a tribunal which makes its own law, but by a
tribunal that obeys the law as made. In this way we maintain two fundamental maxims. The first is, that while to

facts answer juries, to the law answers the court. The second,
which is still more important, is ' nllun ctrmen, nullapcena,
smne lege.' 'Unless there be a violation of law preannounced,
and this by a constant and responsible tribunal, there is no
crime, and can be no punishment." 1 Grim. Law Mag. 56.
The same author, in his treatise on Pleadings and Practice,
concludes his examination of the question in these words.
"The conclusion we must, therefore, accept is, that the jury
are no more judges of law in criminal than in civil cases, with
the qualification that owing to the peculiar doctrine of autrefots acquit, a criminal acquitted cannot be overhauled by the
court. In the Federal courts such is now the established
rule." §§ 809, 810.
Forsyth, in his History of Trial by Jury -a work of merit
-discusses the doctrine advanced by some that the jury were
entitled in all cases, where no special pleas have been put on
the record, to give a general verdict according to their own
views of the law, in criminal as well as in civil cases. He
says "It is impossible to uphold the doctrine. It is founded
on a confusion between the ideas of power and 9ight." "Indeed, it is difficult to understand how any one acquainted
with the principles and settled practice of the English law
can assert that it sanctions the doctrine which is here combated." Again "The distinction between the province of
the judge and that of the jury is, in the English law, clearly
defined, and observed with jealous accuracy The jury must
in all cases determine the value and effect of evidence which
is submitted to them. They must decide what degree of credit
is to be given to a witness, and hold the balance between conflicting probabilities. The law throws upon them the whole
responsibility of ascertaining facts in dispute, and the judge
does not attempt to interfere with the exercise of their unfettered discretion in this respect. But, on the other hand,
the judge has his peculiar duty in the conduct of a trial. He
must determine whether the kind of evidence offered is such
as ought or ought not to be submitted to the jury, and what
liabilities it imposes. When any questions of law arise, he
alone determines them, and their consideration is absolutely

withdrawn from the jury, who must in such cases follow the
direction of the judge, or if they perversely refuse to do so,
their verdict (in civil cases) will be set aside, and a new trial
:granted." London ed. 1852, pp. 261, 262, 282, Morgan's ed.
.pp. 235, 236.
Worthington, in his Inquiry into the Power of Juries, an
:English work published in 1825, and often cited in the adjudged cases, says "Were they [the jury] permitted to decide
the law, the principles of justice would be subverted, the law
would become as variable as the prejudices, the inclinations
-and the passions of men. If they could legally decsde upon
-questions of law, their decision must of necessity be final and
-conclusive, which would involve an absurdity m all judicial
proceedings, and would be contradictory to the fundamental
principles of our jurisprudence." "The jury, when called
upon to decide facts which are complicated with law, are
therefore constitutionally, and must be, from the nature and
intention of the institution, bound to seek and to obey the
-direction of the judge with respect to the law It becomes
their duty to apply to the law thus explained to them the
facts, (which it is their exclusive province to find,) and thus
they deliver a verdict compounded of law and fact, but they
4do not determine or decide upon the law in any case." pp.
193, 191.
Judge Thompson, in his work on Trials, §§ 1016, 101'r, thus
states the principles "The judge decides questions of law,
the jury questions of fact." So in Proffat on Trial by Jury,
"The preponderance of judicial authority in this
§ 375
.country is in favor of the doctrine that the jury should take
the law from the court and apply it to the evidence under its
-direction."
The language of some judges and statesmen in the early
history of the country, implying that the jury were entitled
to disregard the law as expounded by the court, is, perhaps,
to be explained by the fact that "in many of the States the
arbitrary temper of the colonial judges, holding office directly
from the Crown, had made the independence of the jury in
law as well as in fact of much popular importance." Whar-

ton's Cr. P1. & Pr. 8th ed. § 806, Williams v State, 35
Mississippi, 389, 396.
Notwithstanding the declarations of eminent jurists and of
numerous courts, as disclosed in the authorities cited, it is
sometimes confidently asserted that they all erred when adjudging that the rule at common law was that the jury in
criminal cases could not properly disregard the law as given
by the court. We are of opinion that the law in England at
the date of our separation from that country was as declared
in the authorities we have cited. The contrary view rests, as
we think, in large part upon expressions of certain judges and
writers enforcing the principle, that when the question is
compounded of law and fact, a general verdict, ex necessitate,
disposes of the case in hand, both as to law and fact. That
is what Lord Somers meant when he said in his essay on
"The Security of Englishmen's Lives, or the Trust, Power,
and Duty of the Grand Juries of England," that jurors only
"are the judges from whose sentence the indicted are to
expect life or death," and that "by finding guilty or not
guilty, they do complicately resolve both law and fact." In
the speeches of many statesmen and in the utterances of
many jurists will be found the general observation that when
law and fact are "blended" their combined consideration is.
for the jury, and a verdict of guilty or not guilty will determine both for the particular case in hand. But this falls far
short of the contention that the jury, in applying the law to
the facts, may rightfully refuse'to act upon the principles of
law announced by the court.
It is to be observed that those who have maintained the
broad position that a jury may, of right, disregard the law
as declared by the court, cite the judgment of Chief JusticeVaughan in Bushell's case, Vaughan, 135. In that case the
accused were acquitted by a general verdict in opposition, as
tt was charged, to the directions of the court. And the question presented upon habeas corpus was, whether, for so doing,
they were subject to be fined and committed to prison until
the fine was paid. Upon a careful examination of the elaborate opinion in that case, it will become clear that the funda-

Opinion of the Court.

mental proposition decided was that, in view of the different
functions of court and jury, and because a general verdict of
necessity resolves "both law and fact complicately, and not
the fact by itself," it could never be proved, where the case
went to the jury upon both law and facts, that the jurors did
not proceed upon their view of the evdence. Chief Justice
Vaughan said that the words in the.warrant, "that the jury
did acquit against the direction of the court in matter of law,
literally taken, and de plano, are insignificant and not intelligible, for no issue can be joined of matter in law, no jury
can be chargedwith the tral oqf matter in law barely, no evzdence ever was or can be gsven to a jury of what is law or not,
nor no such oath can be gzven to or taken by a?ury, to try
matter m law, nor no attaint can lie for such a false oath."
Vaughan, 143. Touching the distinction between the oath
of a witness and that of a juror, he said "A witness swears
but to what
hath fallen under his senses. But a
juryman swears to what he can infer and conclude from the
testimony of such witnesses, by the act and force of his own
understanding, to be the fact inquired after, which differs
nothing in the reason, though much in the punishment, from
what a judge, out of various cases considered by him, infers
to be law in the question before him." p. 142.
In referring to the opinion in Bushell's case, MV[r. Justice
Curtis well observed that it would be found that Chief
Justice Vaughan "confines himself to a narrow though, for
the case, a conclusive line of argument, that the general issue
embracing fact as well as law, it can never be proved that
the jury believed the testimony on which the fact depended,
and in reference to which the direction was given, and so they
cannot be shown to be guilty of any legal misdemeanor in returning a verdict, though apparently against the direction of
the court in matter of law"
And this is the view of the
opinion in Bushell's case expressgd by Hallam in his Constitutional History of England. c. 13.
A similar criticism was made by the Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts in the case of Anthes. Chief Justice
Shaw, after stating the principles involved in Bushell's case,

said "It may be remarked that from the improved views of
the nature of jury trials, during the two hundred years which
have elapsed since the decision of Chief Justice Vaughan, the
juror is now in no more danger of punishment, for giving an
erroneous judgment in matter of fact, than a judge is for
giving an erroneous judgment in matter of law But his
statement clearly implies that the judge, within his appropriate sphere, is to act by the force of his reason and understanding, and, by the aid of his knowledge of the law and all appropriate means, to adjudge all questions of law, and direct
the
,ythereon, and in like manner the jury, by the force
of their reason and understanding, acting upon all the competent evidence in the case, to reason, weigh evidence, draw
inferences, and adjudge the question of fact embraced in the
issue. Again 'In these cases the jury, and not the judge,
resolve and find what the fact is. Therefore, always, in discreet and lawful assistance of the jury, the judge's direction
is hypothetical and upon supposition, and not positive upon
coercion, namely
If you find the fact thus, (leaving it to
them what to find,) then you are to find for the plaintiff, but
if you find the fact thus, then it is for the defendant.'
Vaughan, 144." "It is strange," Chief Justice Shaw felt
constrained to say, "that the authority of Vaughan, C. J.,
in this case should be cited, as it has been, to prove that a
juror in finding a general verdict, embracing law and fact,
being sworn to try the issue, must find his verdict upon his
own conviction and conscience, relving, in support of the
proposition, upon the following words of Vaughan, C. J
'A man cannot see by another's eye, nor hear by another's
ear; no more can a man decide and infer the thing to be
resolved by another's understanding or reasoning.' Vaughan,
148." Had these words been applied to the whole zssue
embraced in a general verdict, as would be implied from the
manner of referring to them, they would have countenanced
the proposition, but they are used expressly to illustrate the
position, that the jury cannot be required m.mplicitly to give a
verdict by the dictates and authory of the judge. "I refer,"
Chief Justice Shaw continued, "only to one other passage,

which serves as a key to the whole judgment. He says
'That decantatum in our books, ad quwestionem facta non
respondent judices, ad quoestionem legss non respondent juratores, literally taken, is true, for if it be demanded, What is
the fact 2 the judge cannot answer, if it be asked, I-hat ts
the law = the case 9 the yuy cannot answer st.' Vaughan,
149." All this tends to show that the leading thought in the
opinion of Chief Justice Vaughan was that while the jury
cannot answer as to the law, nor the court as to the fact, a
general verdict, compounded of law and fact, of necessity
determines both as to the case on trial.
In Townsend's case, an office taken by virtue of a writ of
mandamus, and decided in the sixteenth century, the court
said "For the office of twelve men is no other than to inquire of matters of fact, and not to adjudge what the law is,
for that is the office of the court, and not of the jury, and if
they find the matter of fact at large, and further say that
thereupon the law is so, where in truth the law is not so, the
judges shall adjudge according to the matter of fact, and not
according to the conclusion of the jury" I Plowd. 111, 114.
In Willion v Berkley, 1 l'lowd. 223, 231, also a civil case
"Matters of fact being traversed, shall be tried by twelve men,
and if the plaintiff should take a traverse here, it would be to,
make twelve illiterate men try a matter of law whereof they
have no knowledge. It is not their office to try matters of
law, but only to try matters of fact, for at the beginnig of
our law it was ordained that matters of fact should be tried
by twelve men of the country where the matter arises, and
matters of law by twelve judges of the law, for which purpose
there were six judges here, and six in the King's Bench, who,
upon matters of law, used to assemble together in a certain
place, in order to discuss what the law was therein. So that
if a traverse should be here taken, it would be to make twelve
ignorant men of the country try that whereof they are not
judges, and which does not belong to them to try" See also

case of murder, said that the jury are judges only of the fact,
and the court of the law Rex v Oneby, 2 Str. 766, 773.
The force of this language as to the functions of judge and
jury is not materially weakened by the fact that the case was
before the judges upon a special verdict, for it was expressly
declared that jurors were judges only of the fact.
Within a few years after Oneby's case was determined, in
1731, the case of King v Poole, which was a criminal information in the nature of a quo warranto, came before Lord
Hardwicke. In passing upon a motion for a new trial that
famous judge, than whom there could be no higher authority
as to what was the settled law of England, said "The thing
that governs greatly in this determination is, that the point of
law is not to be determined by juries, juries have a power by
law to determine matters of fact only and it is of the greatest consequence to the law of England and to the subject, that
these powers of the judge and the jury are kept distinct, that
the judge determine the law, and the jury the fact, and if
ever they come to be confounded, it will prove the confusion
and destruction of the law of England." Cas. Temp. Hardwicke, 23, 27, 28.
Upon the question here under examination Mr. Foster, to
whose work Chief Justice Marshall frequently Yefers in his
opinion or charge delivered in Burr's case, says, in the first
edition of his work, which appeared in 1762, and again in the
third edition, which appeared in 1792 "In every case where
the point turneth upon the question whether the homicide was
committed wilfully and maliciously, or under circumstances
justifying, excusing, or alleviating the matter of fact, viz.,
whether the facts alleged by way of justif cation, excuse, or
allernatwn are true, is the proper and only province of the
jury But whether, upon a supposition of the truth of facts,
such homicide be justified, excused, or alleviated must be submitted to the judgment of the court, for the construction the
law putteth upon facts stated and agreed, or found by a jury

In Wynne's Eunomus, or Dialogues Concering the Law and
Constitution of England, a work of considerable reputation,
the first edition having been published about the time of the
adoption of our Constitution, the principle is thus stated "All
that I have said or have to say upon the subject of juries is
agreeable to this established maxim, that 'juries must answer
to questions of fact and judges to questions of law' This is
the fundamental maxim acknowledged by the Constitution."
"It is undoubtedly true that the jury are judges, the only
judges of the fact, is it not equally within the spirit of the
maxim thatjudges only have the competent cognizance of the

judge and jury distinct, the facts are left altogether to the
jury, and the law does not control the fact, but arises from
it." "Every verdict is compounded of law and'fact, but the

To the same effect is Lev?. v Mfilne, 4 Bing. 195, reported
as Levy v Mlilne, 12 J B. Moore, 418, and decided in 1827.
That was an action of libel. Mr. Sergeant Wilde, a counsel
in the case, contended that in cases of libel the jury are judges
of the law as well as of the fact. But Lord Chief Justice Best
said "If the jury were to be made judges of the law as well
as of fact, parties would be always liable to suffer from an
arbitrary decision. In the present case, the jury have made
themselves judges of the law, and have found against it."
"My brother Wilde has stated that in cases of libel the jury
are judges of the law as well as of fact, but I beg to deny
that. Juries are not judges of the law, or at any rate not in
civil actions. The authority on which the learned Sergeant
has probably grounded his supposition is the 32d G. 3, c. 60,
which was the famous bill brought in by Mr. Fox, or, more
properly, by Lord Erskine. But whoever reads that act will

indictment for offering, disposing of, and putting off a forged

bill of exchange. In the course of his argument to the jury
the counsel for the accused read the observations of Mr. Justice Coleridge in a certain case as sustaining his view of the
law He was interrupted by the judge, who said "I cannot
allow you to read cases to the jury It m the duty of thejury
to take the law from the judge. It no doubt often happens
that, in an address to the jury, counsel cite cases, but then it
is considered that that part of the speech of the counsel is addressed to the judge. That cannot be so here, as you very
properly in the first instance referred me to the case, and you
have my opinion upon it, you can therefore make no further
legitimate use of the case, and the only effect of reading it
would be to discuss propositions of law with the jury, with
whwh they have nothsng to do, and whwhi they ought to take
fromrb me.")
The case of Parmster v Cou~land, 6 Ml. & W 104, 106,
108, which was an action for libel, is not without value as
tending to show that Fox's Libel Bill, so far from changing
the rule, as generally applicable in criminal cases, only required the same practice to be pursued in prosecutions for
libel as in other criminal cases. In the course of the argument of counsel, Parke, B., said "In criminal cases, the
judge is to define the crime, and the jury are to find whether
the party has committed that offence. Mr. Fox's act made it
the same in cases of libel, the practice having been otherwise
before." Again "But it has been the course for a long time
for a judge, in cases of libel, as in other cases of a criminal
nature, first to give a legaZ defin'tson of the offence, and then
to leave it to the jury to say whether the facts necessary to
constitute that offence are proved to their satisfaction, and
that, whether the libel is the subject of a criminal prosecution,
or civil action. A publication, without justification or lawful
excuse, which is calculated to injure the reputation of another,
by exposing him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, is a libel.
Whether the particular publication, the subject of inquiry, is
of that character, and would be likely to produce that effect,
is a question upon which a jury is to exercise their judgment,
and pronounce their opinion, as a guestion offact. *The judge,
VOL. cLvi-7

Opinion of the Court.

as a matter of advice to them in deciding that question, might
have goven his own opinion as to the nature of the publication,
but was not bound to do so as a matter of law Mr. Fox's
Libel Bill was a declaratory act, and put prosecution for libel
on the same footing as other criminal cases." Alderson, B.,
concurring, said that the judge " ought - having defined what
is a libel -to refer to the jury the consideration of the particular publication, whether falhng wzthn that definition 6r not."
It is, therefore, a mistake to suppose that the English Libel
Act changed in any degree the general common law rule in
criminal cases, as to the right of the court to decide the law,
and the duty of the jury to apply the law thus given to the
facts, subject to the condition, inseparable from the jury system, that the jury by a general verdict of necessity determined
in the particular case both law and fact as compounded in the
issue submitted to them. That act provides that "the court
or judge, before whom such indictment or information shall be
tried, shall, according to their or his discretion, give their or
his optnion and directions to the jury on the matter in issue
between the King and the defendant, in like manner as in
other criminal cases." "This seems," Mr. Justice Curtis well
said, "to carry the clearest implication that, in this and all
other criminal cases, the jury may be directed by the judge,
and that, while the object of the statute was to declare that
there was other matter of fact besides publication and the
innuendoes to be decided by the jury, it was not intended to
interfere with the proper province of the judge to decide all
matters of law" 1 Curtis, 55. And this accords with the
views expressed by Lord Abinger in Reeves v Templar, 2 Jur.
131, 138. He said "Before that statute a practice had arisen
of considering that the question, libel or no libel, was always
for the court, independent of the intention and meamng of the
party publishing. That statute corrected the error, and now,
if the intention does not appear on the body of the libel, a
variety of circumstances are to be left to the jury from which
to infer it, but it was never intended to take from the court
the power of deciding whether certain words are per se libellous or not."

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

The rule that jurors do not respond to questions of law was
illustrated in Bshop of .Meath v MZiarquis of Winchester, 4 01.
& Fin. 445, 557, where Lord Chief Justice Tindal, delivering the unanimous opinion of the judges, said "With respect
to the second question lastly above proposed to us, viz.,
whether if the fine were received in evidence it ought to be
left to the jury to say whether it barred the action of quare
'tmpedit, we all think that the legal effect of such fine as a bar
to the action of quare nmpedit is a matter of law merely, and
not in any way a matter of fact, and, consequently, the judge
who tried the cause should state to the jury whether in point
of law the fine had that effect, or what other effect on the
rights of the litigant parties, upon the general and acknowledged principle ad qucest2onemyurts non respondentyuratores."
Briefly stated, the contention of the accused is that although
there may not have been any evmdence whatever to support a
verdict of guilty of an offence less than the one charged and such was the case here -yet, to charge the jury, as matter of law, that the evidence in the case did not authorize any
verdict except one of guilty or one of not guilty of the particular offence charged, was an interference with their legitimate functions, and, therefore, with the constitutional right of
the accused to be tried by a jury
The error in the argument, on behalf of the accused, is in
making the general rule as to the respective functions of court
and jury, applicable equally to a case in which there is some
substantial evidence to support the particular right asserted,
and a case in which there is an entire absence of ewdence to
establish such right. In the former class of cases the court
may not, without impairing the constitutional right of trial by
jury, do what, in the latter cases, it may often do without at
all entrenching upon the constitutional functions of the jury
The law makes it the duty of the jury to return a verdict
according to the evidence in the particular case before them.
But if there are no facts in evidence bearing upon the issue to
be determined, it is the duty of the court, especially when so
requested, to instruct them as to the law arising out of that
state of case. So, if there be some evidence bearing upon a

particular issue in a cause, but it is so meagre as not, in law,
to justify a verdict in favor of the party producing it, the court
is in the line of duty when it so declares to the jury Pleasants v Pant,22 Wall. 116, 121,
JMontla-r v Dana,107 U S.
162, Randall v Baltimore & Ohw Railroad,109 U. S. 478,

The cases just cited were, it is true, of a civil nature, but
the rules they announce are, with few exceptions, applicable to criminal causes, and indicate the true test for determining the respective functions of court and jury Who can
doubt, for instance, that the court has the right even in a capital case to instruct the jury as matter of law to return a verdict
of acquittal on the evidence adduced by the prosecution.
Could it be said, in view of the established principles of criminal law, that such an instruction entrenched upon the province
of the jury to determine from the evidence whether the
accused was guilty or not guilty of the offence charged, or
of some lesser offence included in the one charged 2 Under a
given state of facts, outlined in an instruction to the jury, certain legal presumptions may arise. May not the court tell the
jury what those presumptions are, and should not the jury
assume that they are told truly2 If the court excludes evidence given in the hearing of the jury, and instructs them to
disregard it altogether, is it not their duty to obey that instruction, whatever may be their view of the admissibility of such
evidence 2 In Famous Smth v Unsted States, 151 U S. 50,
55, which was an indictment for the murder, in the Indian
Territory, of one Gentry, "a white man and not an Indian,"
we said "That Gentry was a white man, and not an Indian,
was a fact which the government was bound to establish, and
if it failed to introduce any evidence upon that point, defendant was entitled to an instruction to that effect. Without
expressing any opinion as to the correctness of the legal propositions embodied in this charge, we think there was no testimony which authorized the court to submit to the jury the
question whether Gentry was a white man and not an Indian.

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

The objection went to the jurisdiction of the court, and if
no other reasonable inference could have been drawn from
the evidence than that Gentry was an Indian, defendant was
entitled, as matter of law, to an acquittal" -citing Pleasants
v. Pant, 22 Wall. 116, County Commssszoners v Clark, 94:
U. S. 278, and Mfarshall v Hubbard, 117 U S. 415. So, in
this case, it was competent for the court to say to the jury
that on account of the absence of all evmdence tending to show
that the defendants were guilty of manslaughter, they could not,
consistently with law, return a verdict of guilty of that crime.
Any other rule than that indicated in the above observations would bring confusion and, uncertainty in the administration of the criminal law Indeed, if a jury may rightfully
disregard the direction of the court in matter of law, and determine for themselves what the law is in the particular case
before them, it is difficult to perceive any legal ground upon.
which a verdict of conviction can be set aside by the court as
being against law If it be the function of the jury to decide
the law as well as the facts - if the function of the court be
only advisory as to the law - why should the court interfere
for the protection of the accused against what it deems an
error of the jury in matter of law
Public and private safety alike would be in peril, if the
principle be established that juries in criminal cases may, of
right, disregard the law as expounded to them by the court
and become a law unto themselves. Under such a system, the
principal function of the judge would be to preside and keep
order while jurymen, untrained in the law, would determine
questions affecting life, liberty, or property according to such
legal principles as in their judgment were applicable to the
particular case being tried. If because, generally speaking,
it is the function of the jury to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused according to the evidence, of the truth or
weight of which they are to judge, the court should be held
bound to instruct them upon a point in respect to which there
was no evidence whatever, or to forbear stating what the law
is upon a given state of facts, the result would be that the enforcement of the law against criminals and the protection of

citizens against unjust and groundless prosecutions, would depend entirely upon juries uncontrolled by any settled, fixed,
legal principles. And if it be true that jurors in a criminal
case are under no legal obligation to take the law from the
court, and may determine for themselves what the law is, it
necessarily results that counsel for the accused may, of right,
in the presence of both court and jury, contend that what the
court declares to be the law applicable to the case in hand is
not the law, and, in support of his contention, read to the
jury the reports of adjudged cases and the views of elementary writers. Undoubtedly, in some jurisdictions, where juries
in criminal cases have the right, in virtue of constitutional or
statutory provisions, to decide both law and facts upon their
own judgment as to what the law is, and as to what the facts
are, it may be the privilege of counsel to read and discuss adjudged cases before the jury And in a few jurisdictions, in
which it is held that the court alone responds as to the law,
that practice is allowed in deference to long usage. But upon
principle, where the matter is not controlled by express constitutional or statutory provisions, it cannot be regarded as
the right of counsel to dispute before the jury the law as declared by the court. Under the contrary view - if it be held
that the court may not authoritatively decide all questions of
law arising in criminal cases -the result will be that when a
new trial in a criminal case is ordered, even by this court, the
jury, upon such trial, may of right return a verdict based upon
the assumption that what this court has adjudged to be law is
not law We cannot give our sanction to any rule that will
lead to such a result. We must hold firmly to the doctrine that
in the courts of the United States it is the duty of juries in
criminal cases to take the law from the court and apply that
law to the facts as they find them to be from the evidence.
Upon the court rests the responsibility of declaring the law,
upon the jury, the responsibility of applying the law so declared
to the facts as they, upon their conscience, believe them to be.
Under any other system, the courts, although established in
order to declare the law, would for every practical purpose
be eliminated from our system of government as instrumen-

talities devised for the protection equally of society and of
individuals in their essential rights. When that occurs our
government will cease to be a government of laws, and become a government of men. Liberty regulated by law is the
underlying principle of our institutions.
To instruct the jury in a criminal case that the defendant
cannot properly be convicted of a crime less than that charged,
or to refuse to instruct them in respect to the lesser offences
that might, under some circumstances, be included in the one
so charged -there being no evidence whatever upon which
any verdict could be properly returned except one of guilty
or one of not guilty of the particular offence charged - is not
error, for the instructing or refusing to instruct, under the
circumstances named, rests upon legal principles or presumptions which it is the province of the court to declare for the
gmdance of the jury In the case supposed the court is as
clearly in the exercise of its legitimate functions, as it is when
ruling that particular evidence offered is not competent, or
that evidence once admitted shall be stricken out and not be
considered by the jury, or when it withdraws from the jury
all proof of confessions by the accused upon the ground that
such confessions, not having been made freely and voluntarily,
are inadmissible under the law as evidence against the accused.
These views are sustained by a very great weight of authority in this country In People v Barry, 90 Califorma, 41,
which was a criminal prosecution for an assault with intent
to commit robbery, the accused having been twice before convicted of petit larceny, it was held not to be error to refuse to
instruct the jury that under the charge they might find him
guilty of simple assault, because "the evidence tended to show
that he was guilty of the crime charged or of no offence at
all," and, therefore, "the instruction asked was-not applicable
to the facts of the case;" in Peo2,l v ]iacutt,93 California,
658, the offence charged being an assault with a deadly
weapon and with intent to commit murder, that an instruction that the jury might convict of a simple assault could
have been properly refused, because "under the evidence he

Penn. St. 81, a case of murder, that the omission of an instruction on the law of voluntary manslaughter, and the
power of the jury to find it, was not error, because the
murder was deliberate murder, and "there was no evidence
on which it could be reduced to a milder form of homicide,"
in State v Lane, 64 Missouri, 319, 324, which was an indictment for murder in the first degree, that "if the evidence
makes out a case of murder in the first degree, and applies
to that kind of killing, and no other, the court would commit
no error in confining its instructions to that offence and refusing to instruct either as to murder in the second degree or
manslaughter in any of its various degrees," and when an instruction "is given for any less grade of offence, and there is
no evidence upon which to base it," the judgment should
be reversed for error, in .Mc Coy v State, 27 Texas App. 415,
the charge being murder of the first degree, that the refusal
to charge the law of murder in the second degree was not
error, for the reason that if the defendant was "criminally
responsible at all for the homicide, the grade of the offence
under the facts is not short of murder of the first degree," in
State v 2elcEinney, 111 N. 0. 683, a murder case, that as
there was no testimony on either side tending to show manslaughter, a charge that there was no element of manslaughter
in the case, and that the defendant was guilty of murder or
not guilty of anything at all, as the jury should find the facts,
was strictly in accordance with the testimony and the precedents, in State v H1uszwk, 101 Missouri, 260, 270, where the
charge was an assault with malice aforethought, punishable by
confinement in the penitentiary, that an instruction looking to
a conviction for a lower grade included in the offence charged,
was proper where there was evidence justifying it, in State v
Oasford, 76 Iowa, 330, 332, that the defendant, so charged in
an indictment that he could be convicted of rape, an assault to
commit rape, or an assault and battery, was not prejudiced by

the defendant being therefore guilty of "murder in the first

it, in State v. .Estep, 44 Kansas, 572, 575, a case of murder of the
first degree, that there was no testimony tending to show that
the defendant was guilty of manslaughter m either the first,
second, or fourth degrees, instructions as to those degrees
should not have been given, and in Robznson v State, 84
Georgia, 674, a case of assault with intent to murder, that the
refusal to instruct the jury that the defendant could have been
found guilty of an assault, or of assault and battery, was not
error,-" for there was nothing in the evidence to justify the
court in so instructing the jury"
We have said that, with few exceptions, the rules which obtain in civil cases in relation to the authority of the court to
instruct the jury upon all matters of law arising upon the
issues to be tried, are applicable in the trial of criminal cases.
The most important of those exceptions is that it is not competent for the court, in a criminal case, to instruct the jury
peremptorily to find the accused guilty of the offence charged
or of any criminal offence less than that charged. The grounds
upon which this exception rests were well stated by Judge
MfcCrary, Mr. Justice Miller concurring, in Uhnsted States v
Taylor, 3 McOrary, 500, 505. It was there said. "In a civil
case, the court may set aside the verdict, whether it be for the
plaintiff or defendant, upon the ground that it is contrary to
the law as given by the court, but in a criminal case, if the verdict is one of acquittal, the court has no power to set it aside.
It would be a useless form for a court to submit a civil case
involving only questions of law to the consideration of a jury,
where the verdict, when found, if not in accordance with the
court's view of the law, would be set aside. The same result

Opinion of the Court.

is accomplished by an instruction given in advance to find a
verdict in accordance with the court's opinion of the law
But not so in criminal cases. A verdict of acquittal cannot be
set aside, and therefore, if the court can direct a verdict of
guilty, it can do indirectly that which it has no power to do
directly"
We are of opinion that the court below did not err m saying to the jury that they could not consistently with the law
arising from the evidence find the defendants guilty of manslaughter or of any offence less than the one charged, that if
the defendants were not guilty of the offence charged, the
duty of the jury was to return a verdict of not guilty No
instruction was given that questioned the right of the jury to,
determine whether the witnesses were to be believed or not, nor
whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty of the offence
charged. On the contrary, the court was careful to say that
the jury were the exclusive judges of the facts, and that they
were to determine -applying to the facts the principles of
law announced by the court- whether the evidence established the guilt or innocence of the defendants of the charge
set out in the indictment.
The trial was thus conducted upon the theory that it was
the duty of the court to expound the law and that of the jury
to apply the law as thus declared to the facts as ascertained
by them. In this separation of the functions of court and
jury is found the chief value, as well as safety, of the jury
system. Those functions cannot be confounded or disregarded
without endangering the stability of public justice, as well as
the security of private and personal rights.
The main reason ordinarily assigned for a recognition of
the right of the jury, in a criminal case, to take the law into
their own hands, and to disregard the directions of the court
in matters of law, is that the safety and liberty of the citizen
will be thereby more certainly secured. That view was urged
upon Mr. Justice Curtis. After stating that if he conceived
the reason assigned to be well founded, he would pause long
before denying the existence of the power claimed, he said
that a good deal of reflection had convinced him that the

argument was the other way He wisely observed, that " as
long as the judges of the United States are obliged to express
their opinions publicly, to give their reasons for them when
called upon in the usual mode, and to stand responsible for
them, not only to public opinion, but to a court of impeachment, I can apprehend very little danger of the laws being
wrested to purposes of injustice. But, on the other hand, I do
consider that this power and corresponding duty of the court,
authoritatively to declare the law, is one of the .highest safeguards of the citizen. The sole end of courts of justice is to
enforce the laws uniformly and impartially, without respect
of persons or times or the opinions of men. To enforce popular laws is easy But when an unpopular cause is a just cause,
when a law, unpopular in some locality, is to be enforced,
there then comes the strain upon the administration of justice,
and few unprejudiced men would hesitate as to where that
strain would be most firmly borne." Unsted States v. .Morms,

I concur in the views expressed in the opinion of the court
as to the separate functions of court and jury, and in the
judgment of affirmance against Hansen, but I do not concur
in holding that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of
confessions, or in the judgment of reversal as to Sparf.
The facts briefly stated are these There was a single
indictment charging the defendants jointly with the crime of
murder. There was a single case on trial, a case in which the
government was the party on one side and the two defendants

OCTOBER TERI, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Brewer, Brown, JJ.

the party on the other. These two defendants were represented by the same counsel. Three witnesses testified to confessions of Hansen. Counsel for defendants objected to each
of these confessions. These objections were in the same form.
They purported to be for the defendants jointly, and not
separately for each. Two of the confessions were given in
the presence of Sparf, and in admitting them it is not pretended that there was any error. One was made in the
absence of Sparf, and it is held that the court erred in overruling the objection to it. The objection was that the testimony offered was "irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent,
and upon the ground that any statement made by Hansen
was not and could not be voluntary" It will be noticed that
this objection was both general and special, the special
ground, that which would naturally arrest the attention of
the court, being that the confession was not voluntary This
ground of objection it is admitted was not well taken. If
there was any error it was in overruling the general objection
that the testimony was irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent. But it is conceded that this confession was material,
relevant, and competent, was properly admitted in evidence
on the single trial then pending, and properly heard by the
jury The real burden of complaint is that when the court
admitted the testimony it ought to have instructed the jury
that it was evidence only against Hansen, and not against
Sparf. But in common fairness ought not the attention of
the court to have been called to the difference, and a ruling
had upon that difference 9 Cannot parties present a joint
objection to testimony and rest their case upon such objection ,
Is it the duty of the court to consider a matter which is not
called to its attention, and make a ruling which it is not asked
to make 9 Is it not the duty of the court to be impartial
between the government and the defendant, and decide
simply the questions which each party presents 2 Is it its
duty to watch over the interests of either party, and to put
into the mouth of counsel an objection which he does not
make2 To mv mind such a doctrine is both novel and dangerous. I do not question the proposition that a confession

made by one of two defendants in the absence of the other is
to be considered by the jury only as against the one making
it, and I admit that if a separate objection had been made by
Sparf the court would have been called upon to formally sustain such objection, and instruct the jury that such testimony
was to be considered by them only as against Hansen. If an
instruction had been asked, as is the proper way, the attention of the court would have been directed to the matter, and
an adverse ruling would have rightly presented the error
which is now relied upon. But I need not refer to the oftrepeated decisions of this court that there is no error in failing
to give an instruction which is not asked, unless it be one of
those which a statute in terms reqmres the court to give, and
there is no pretence of any such statute. Lewts v. Lee County,
66 Alabama, 480, 489, was decided in accordance with the
views which I have expressed. The court in that case say
"The witness Frazier's testimony, as to his conversation
with the defendant Lewis, regarding the condition of his accounts as county treasurer, was properly admitted in evidence.
It was certainly good as an admission against him, and could
not be excluded because not admissible against the sureties,
who were his codefendants in the action. The practice on
this point is well settled in this State, that the only remedy
of a codefendant, in such a case, is to request a charge from
the court to the jury, limiting the operation of the evidence,
so as to confine its influence only to the defendant against
whom it is admissible."
So m State v Bzte, 73 N. C. 26, 28, a similar ruling was
made, the court saying
"The defendant's first exception is that his honor allowed
Culpepper, a codefendant, to introduce witnesses to prove his
(Brite's) declarations while in jail, which tended to exonerate
Culpepper."
"While these declarations are not evidence, either for or
against Culpepper, being, as to him, res mnter alios acta, and
made by one not under oath, and subject to cross-examination,
yet they are clearly admissible against Brite, and it makes no
difference whether they were called forth by the State, or by

Culpepper, without objection, or rather with the sanction of
the State."
I have been able to find no case laying down a contrary doctrine. In Mutua -Lfe Is. Co. v. Rilrnon, 145 U S. 285, each
defendant separately for itself presented the objection, and
each, therefore, had the right to avail itself of the ruling made
by the court. Indeed, I think this will be found to be the
first case in which it has been held that, while the court properly allowed testimony to go to the jury on the trial of a case,
the judgment has been reversed because it failed to call the
attention of the jury to the bearing of that evidence upon the
different parties when such parties never asked the court to so
instruct the jury
I am authorized to say that MR.JUSTicE BRowN concurs in
these views.

JusTiCE

Mr. Justice Shiras and myself concur in so much of the
opinion of the majority of the court as awards a new trial to
one of the defendants, by reason of the admission in evidence
against him of confessions made in his absence by the other.
But from the greater part of that opinion, and from the
affirmance of the conviction of the other defendant, we are
compelled to dissent, because, in our judgment, the case, involving the question of life or death to the prisoners, was not
submitted to the decision of the jury as required by the Constitution and laws of the United States.
The two defendants, Herman Sparf and Hans Hansen,
together with Thomas St. Clair, seamen on board the brig
Hesper, an American vessel, were indicted for the murder of
Maurice Fitzgerald, the second mate, on the high seas, on
January 13, 1893, by striking him with a weapon and by
throwing him overboard and drowning him.
St. Clair was separately tried, convicted and sentenced, and
his conviction was affirmed by this court at the last term.

Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shras, JJ.

At the trial of Sparf and Hansen, there was no direct testimony of any eye-witness to the killing, or to any assault or
affray There was evidence that, at ten o'clock in the evening of the day in question, the second mate was at the wheel,
in charge of the starboard watch, consisting of St. Clair,
Sparf, Hansen and another seaman, and that, when the
watch was changed at midnight, the second mate could not
be found, and there was much blood on the deck, as well as
a bloody broomstick and a wooden bludgeon. The rest of
the evidence consisted of testimony of other seamen to acts
and statements of each defendant and of St. Clair, before and
after the disappearance of the second mate, tending to prove
a conspiracy to kill him, and to subsequent confessions of
Hansen, tending to show that the killing was premeditated.
The judge, in his charge to the jury, gave the following
instructions "The indictment is based upon section 5339 of
the Revised Statutes, which provides, among other things,
that 'every person who commits murder' 'upon the high
seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven, creek,
basin, or bay, within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of
any particular State, or who upon any of such waters
maliciously strikes, stabs, wounds, poisons, or shoots at any
other person, of which striking, stabbing, wounding, poisoning, or shooting such other person dies, either on land or at
sea, within or without the United States, shall suffer death.'"
"Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being in the
peace of the State, with malice aforethought, express or
implied." "Express malice " was defined as "deliberate premeditation and design, formed in advance to kill or to do
bodily harm, the premeditation and design being implied
from external circumstances capable of proof, such as lying
in wait, antecedent threats, and concerted schemes against
a victim," and "implied malice" as "an inference of the
law from any deliberate and cruel act committed by one
person against another," "that is, malice is inferred when
one kills another without provocation, or when the provocation is not great." "Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

a human being, without malice, either expressed or implied.
I do not consider it necessary, gentlemen, to explain it
further, for, if a felonious homicide has been committed, of
which you are to be the judges from the proof, there is nothing in this case to reduce it below the grade of murder."
"Every person present at a murder, willingly aiding or abetting its perpetration, is guilty of murder, and may be indicted
and convicted as principal in the first degree." "It is not my
purpose, nor is it my function, to assume any fact to be
proven, nor to suggest to you that any fact has been proven.
You are the exclusive judges of the facts."
The defendants requested the judge to instruct the jury that
"under the indictment in this case the defendants may be convicted of murder, or manslaughter, or of an attempt to commit
murder or manslaughter, and if, after a full and careful consideration of all the evidence before you, you believe beyond
a reasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty either of
manslaughter, or of an assault with intent to commit murder
or manslaughter, you should so find your verdict." The judge
refused to give this instruction, and the defendants excepted to
the refusal.
The jury, after deliberating on the case for some time, returned into court, and being asked whether they had agreed
upon a verdict, the foreman said that one of the jurors wished
to be instructed upon certain points under the laws of the
United States as to murder upon the high seas. One of the
jurors then said that he "would like to know, in regard to
the interpretation of the laws of the United States in regard
to manslaughter, as to whether the defendants can be found
guilty of manslaughter, or that the defendants must be found
guilty," evidently meaning "of murder," the whole offence
charged in the indictment. The judge then read again section 5339 of the Revised Statutes. The juror asked "Are
the two words ' aiding' or ' abetting' defined 2" The judge
replied "The words 'aiding' or ' abetting ' are not defined.
IBut I have instructed you as to the legal effect of aiding and
abetting, and this you should accept as law If I have made
an error, there is a higher tribunal to correct it." The juror

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITE'D STATES.

113

Dissenting Opinion. Gray Shiras, JJ.

said "I am the spokesman for two of us. We desire to
clearly understand the matter. It is a barrier in our mind to
our determining the matter. The question arising amongst
us is as to aiding and abetting. Furthermore, as I understand,
it must be one thing or the other. It must be either guilty or
not guilty" The judge replied "Yes, under the instructions I have given you." The judge then, after repeating the
general definitions, as before given, of murder and of manslaughter, said " If a felonious homicide has been committed
by either of the defendants, of which you are to be the judges
from the proof, there is nothing in this case to reduce it below
the grade of murder," and, m answer to further questions of
the juror, repeated this again and again, and said "1In a
proper case, it may be murder, or it may be manslaughter,
but in this case it cannot properly be manslaughter." The
defendants excepted to these instructions. And finally, in
answer to the juror's direct question, " Then there is no other
verdict we can bring in, except guilty or not guilty 2 " the
judge said "In a proper case, a verdict for manslaughter
may be rendered, as the district attorney has stated, and even
m this case you have the physical power to do so, but, as one
of the tribunals of the country, a jury is expected to be governed by law, and the law it should receive from the court."
The juror then said "There has been a misunderstanding
amongst us. Now it is clearly interpreted to us, and no
doubt we can now agree on certain facts." Thereupon a
verdict of guilty of murder was returned agaanst both defendants, and they were sentenced to death, and sued out this writ
of error.
The judge, by instructing the jury that they were bound to
accept the law as given to them by the court, demed their right
to decide the law And by instructing them that, if a felonious homicide by the defendants was proved, there was nothing in the case to reduce it below the grade of murder, and
they could not properly find it to be manslaughter, and by
declining to submit to them the question whether the defendant were guilty of manslaughter only, he denied their right
to decide the fact. The colloquy between the judge and the

jurors, when they came in for further instructions, clearly
shows that the jury, after deliberating upon the case, were in
doubt whether the crime which the defendants had committed
was murder or manslaughter, and that it was solely by reason
of these instructions of the judge, that they returned a verdict
of the higher crime.
It is our deep and settled conviction, confirmed by a re~xammation of the authorities under the responsibility of taking
part in the consideration and decision of the capital case now
before the court, that the jury, upon the general issue of guilty
or not guilty in a criminal case, have the right, as well as
the power, to decide, according to their own judgment and
consciences, all questions, whether of law or of fact, involved
in that issue.
The question of the right of the jury to decide the law in
criminal cases has been the subject of earnest and repeated
controversy in England and America, and eminent jurists
have differed in their conclusions upon the question. In this
country, the opposing views have been fully and strongly set
forth by Chancellor Kent in favor of the right of the jury,
and by Chief Justice Lewis against it, in People v Croswell,
3 Johns. Cas. 337, by Judge Hall in favor of the right, and
by Judge Bennett against it, in State v Croteau, 23 Vermont,
14, and by Chief Justice Shaw against the right, and by Mr.
Justice Thomas in its favor, in Commonwealth v Anthes, 5
Gray, 185.
The question of the right of the jury under the Constitution
of the United States cannot be usefully or satisfactorily discussed without examining and stating the authorities which
bear upon the scope and effect of the provisions of the Constitution regarding this subject. In pursuing this inquiry, it
will be convenient to consider, first, the English authorities,
secondly, the authorities in the several Colonies and States of
America, and lastly, the authorities under the national government of the United States.
By Magna Charta, no person could be taken or imprisoned,
or deprived of his freehold or of his liberties or free customs,

land - nssper legale judimum parum suorum, vel per legem
terrce. Accordingly, by the law of England, at the time of
the discovery and settlement of this country by Englishmen,
every subject (not a member of the House of Lords) indicted
for treason, murder or other felony, had the right to plead
the general issue of not guilty, and thereupon to be tried by a
jury, and, if they acquitted him, the verdict of acquittal was
conclusive, in his favor, of both the law and the fact involved
m the issue. The jury, in any case, criminal or civil, might
indeed, by finding a special verdict reciting the facts, refer a
pure question of law to the court, but they were not bound
and could not be compelled to do so, even in a civil action.
By the statute of Westm. 2, (13 Edw I,) c. 30, "it is
ordained, that the justices assigned to take assizes shall not
compel the jurors to say precisely whether it be disseisin or
not, so that they do shew the truth of the fact, and require
aid of the justices, but if they of their own head will say,
that it is or is not disseisin, their verdict shall be admitted at
their own peril." 1 Statutes of the Realm, 86. That statute,
as Lord Coke tells us, was declaratory of the common law,
and before its enactment some justices directed juries to
return general verdicts, thus subjecting them to the peril of
an attaint if they mistook the law 2 Inst. 422, 425.
Littleton, speaking of civil actions in which the jury, upon
the general issue pleaded, might return a special verdict, says
that "if they will take upon them the knowledge of the law
upon the matter, they may give their verdict generally, as is
put in their charge." Lit. § 368. And accordingly Lord
Coke says "Although the jury, if they will take upon them
(as Littleton here saith) the knowledge of the law, may.give
a general verdict, yet it is dangerous for them so to do, for
if they do mistake the law, they run into the danger of an
attaint, therefore to find the special verdict is the safest
where the case is doubtful." Co. Lit. 227 b.
Lord Coke elsewhere says that "the jury ought, if they
will not find the special matter, to find ' at their peril ' according to law" Rawlns's case, 4 Rep. 52 a,53 b. And Lord
Chief Justice Hobart says "Legally it will be hard to quit

a jury that finds against the law, either common law or
several statute law, whereof all men were to take knowledge,
and whereupon verdict is to be given, whether any evidence
be given to them or not," and "though no man informed
them what the law was in that case." feedler v Btshop of
Ifinohester, Hob. 220, 227.

The peril or danger, above spoken of, into which the jury
ran by taking upon themselves the knowledge of the law, and
undertaking to decide by a general verdict the law involved
in the issue of fact submitted to them, was the peril of an
attaint, upon which their verdict might be set aside and themselves punished. Upon the attaint, however, the trial was
not by the court, but by a jury of twenty-four, it was only
by a verdict of the second jury, and not by judgment of the
court only, that the first verdict could be set aside, and, if
not so set aside, the second verdict was final and conclusive.

Lord Bacon, in his History of Henry VII, (originally

into Latin by himself or under his supervision,) speaking of

only reason, for this reason holdeth not in the appeal-ub

239.] But the great reason was, lest it should tend to the
discouragement of jurors in cases of life and death -neforte
juratores ?n causts capitalibus timsdius se gererent-if they
should be subject to suit and penalty, where the favour of
life maketh against them." 6 Bacon's Works, (ed. 1858,) 5, 7,
160, 161, 5 Bacon's Works, (ed. 1803,) 117, 9 Id. 483.
Lord Bacon was mistaken in assuming that the attaint was
introduced by the St. of 11 Hen. VII, c. 24, for it existed at
common law in writs of assize, and had been regulated and
extended to other civil actions by many earlier statutes.
2 Inst. 130, 237, 427, Finch, Law, lib. 4, c. 47.
But the mistake does not diminish the force of Lord Bacon's
statements that, wherever an attaint did not lie, the "judgment
of the jury, commonly called verdict, was considered as a kind
of gospel ," and that the reasons why an attaint did not lie
in a capital case were, not only that two juries, the indictors
and the triers, had passed upon the case, but chiefly that
juries, in cases of life and death, should not be discouraged, or
act timidly, by being subjected to suit and penalty if they
decided in favor of life.
John M-ilton, in his Defence of the People of England, after
speaking of the King's power in his courts and through his
"Nay, all the ordinary power is rather the
judges, adds
people's, who determine all controversies themselves by juries
of twelve men. And hence it is that when a malefactor is
asked at his arraignment, Eow will you be trzed 9 he answers

Bracton. Bract. 119.
In the reign of Charles II, some judges undertook to instruct
juries that they must take the law from the court, and to
punish them if they returned a verdict in favor of the accused
against the judge's instructions. Bub, as often as application
was made to higher judicial authority, the punishments were
set aside, and the rights of juries vindicated.
In 1665, upon the trial of an indictment against three
Quakers for an unlawful conventicle, Wagstaffe and other

jurors were fined by Chief Justice Kelyng for acquitting
"against full evidence, and against the direction of the court
in matter of law, in said court openly given and declared" contra plenat ewdentham, et contra directonem cure in
materzalegzs, ,?ndicta curza ibidem aperte datam et declaratam.

His reasons for this (as stated in his own manuscript note of
the case, not included in the first edition of his reports, published by Lord Holt in 1708) were "that they and others may
know that a wilful jury cannot make an act of Parliament or
the law of England of no effect but they are accountable and
punishable for it," and "that in criminal cases the court may
fine a jury who will give a verdict contrary to their evidence,
and the reason (as I take it) is that otherwise a headstrong jury
might overthrow all the course of justice, for no attaint lieth
in criminal causes, and also one verdict is peremptory, and a
new trial cannot be granted in criminal causes, and therefore
the judges have always punished such wilful juries by fine and
imprisonment, and binding them to their good behaviour."
But at the end of his report is this memorandum "KNote, the
whole case of the Quakers, as to fining jury, now not law" J
Kel. (3d ed.) 69-75. And Lord Hale, then Chief Baron, tells
us that the jurors "were thereupon committed, and brought
their habeas corpus in the Court of Common Bench, and all
the judges of England were assembled to consider of the
legality of this fine, and the imprisonment thereupon," and
the jurors were discharged of their imprisonment, for the following reasons
"It was agreed by all the judges of England (one only dissenting) that this fine was not legally set upon the jury, for
they are the judges of matters of fact, and although it was
inserted in the fine, that it was contra direchonem curtce zn
materza legzs, this mended not the matter, for it was impossible any matter of law could come in question, till the matter
of fact were settled and stated and agreed by the jury, and of
such matter of fact they were the only competent judges.
And although the witnesses might perchance swear the fact
to the satisfaction of the court, yet the jury are judges, as
well of the credibility of the witnesses, as of the truth of the

fact, for possibly they might know somewhat of their own
knowledge, that what was sworn was untrue, and possibly
they might know the witnesses to be such as they could not
believe, and it is the conscience of the jury that must pronounce the prisoner guilty or not guilty And to say the
truth, it were the most unhappy case that could be to the
judge, if he at his peril must take upon him the guilt or
innocence of the prisoner, and if the judge's opinion must
rule the matter of fact, the trial by jury would be useless."
2 Hale P 0. 312, 313.
Lord Hale's apparent meaning is that, at a trial upon the
plea of not guilty, the jury are the judges of the issue of fact
thereby presented, and it is the conscience of the jury that
must pronounce the prisoner guilty or not guilty, that, as
no matter of law can come in question unless the facts are
first found by the jury in a special verdict, it were idle to say
that a general verdict was against the judge's direction or
opinion in matter of law, and that if the judge's opinion in
matter of law must rule the issue of fact submitted to the
jury, the trial by jury would be useless.
The reasons are more fully brought out in Bushell's case, in
1670, not mentioned in the text of Lord Hale's treatise, and
doubtless decided after -that was written. William Penn and
William Mead having been indicted and tried for a similar
offence, and acquitted against the instructions of the court,
Bushell and the other jurors who tried them were fined
by Sir John Howell, Recorder of London, and Bushell was
committed to prison, in like terms, for not paying his fine,
and sued out a writ of habeas corpus. Pemnt & .ffead's case,

At the hearing thereon, Scroggs, the King's serjeant,
argued "It is granted, that in matters of fact only, the jury
are to be judges, but when the matter of fact is mixed with
matter of law, the law is to guide the fact, and they are to be
gided by the court. The jury are at no inconvemence, for if
they please they may find the special matter, but if they will

take upon them to know the law, and do mistake, they are
punishable." 1 Freeman, 3.
But Bushell was discharged from imprisonment, for reasons
stated in the judgment delivered by Sir John Vaughan, Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, after a conference of all the
judges of England, including Lord Hale, and with the concurrence of all except Chief Justice Kelyng. Vaughan, 144, 145,
1 Freeman, 5, Lord Holt, in Groenwelt v Bzurwell, 1 Ld.
Raym. 454, 470.
In that great judgment, as reported by himself, Chief
Justice Vaughan discussed separately the two parts of the
return, first, that the acquittal was "against full and manifest evidence," and, second, that it was "against the direction
of the court in matter of law"
It was in discussing the first part, that he observed "that
the verdict of a jury, and evidence of a witness, are very different things, in the truth and falsehood of them. A witness
swears but to what he hath heard or seen, generally or more
largely, to what hath fallen under his senses. But a juryman
swears to what he can infer and conclude from the testimony
of such witnesses, by the act and force of his understanding,
to be the fact inquired after, which differs nothing in the
reason, though much in the punishment, from what a judge,
out of various cases considered by him, infers to be the law in
the question before him." Vaughan, 142.
After disposing of that part of the return, he proceeds as
follows "We come now to the next part of the return, viz.
That the jury acquitted those zndicted, agaisnst the direction of
the court ?n' matter of law, openly gmven and declared to them
sn court.

"The words, that the jury did acquzt, aganst the direction
of the court m matter of law, literally taken, and de piano, are
insignificant and not intelligible, for no issue can be joined
of matter in law, no jury can be charged with the trial of
matter in law barely, no evidence ever was, or can be, given to
a jury of what is law, or not, nor no such oath can be given
to, or taken by, a jury to try matter in law, nor no attaint
can lie for such a false oath.

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shiras, JJ.

"Therefore we must take off this vail and colour of words,
-which make a shew of being something, and in truth are
nothing.
"If the meaning of these words, Jfnding agamnst the direc-tion of the court m matter qf law, be, that if the judge, having heard the evidence given in court (for he knows no other)
.shall tell the jury, upon this evidence, the law is for the plaintiff, or for the defendant, and you are under the pain of fine
.and imprisonment to find accordingly, then the jury ought of
-duty so to do Every man sees that the jury is but a trouble-some delay, great charge, and of no use in determining right
.and wrong, and therefore the trials by them may be better
abolished than continued, which were a strange new-found
-conclusion, after a trial so celebrated for many hundreds
-of years.
"For if the judge, from the evidence, shall by his own
judgment first resolve upon any trial what the fact is, and so
knowing the fact, shall then resolve what the law is, and
-order the jury penally to find accordingly, what either neces.sary or convenient use can be fancied of juries, or to continue
trials by them at all?
"But if the jury be not obliged m all trials to follow such
-directions, if given, but only in some sort of trials (as, for
instance, m trials for criminal matters upon indictments or
.appeals) why then the consequence will be, though not in all,
yet in criminal trials, the jury (as of no material use) ought to
be either omitted or abolished, which were the greater mis-chief to the people, than to abolish them in civil trials.
"And how the jury should, in any other manner, according
to the course of trials used, find against the direction of the
,court in matter of law, is really not conceptible." Vaughan,
143, 144.
He then observes "This is ordinary, when the jury find
unexpectedly for the plaintiff or defendant, the judge will ask,
How do you find such a fact in particular 2 and upon their
answer he will say, then it is for the defendant, though they
find for the plaintiff, or e contrarso, and thereupon they rectify their verdict. And in these cases, the jury, and not the

Dissenting Opinion. Gray Shiras, JJ.

judge, resolve and find what the fact is. Therefore always,
in discreet and lawful assistance of the jury, the judge's direction is hypothetical, and upon supposition, and not positive
and upon coercion, viz. If you find the fact thus (leaving
it to them what to find) then you are to find for the plaintiff,.
but if you find the fact thus, then it is for the defendant."
But he is careful to add that, "whatsoever they have answered
the judge upon an interlocutory question or discourse, they
may lawfully vary from it if they find cause, and are not.
thereby concluded." pp. 144, 145.
It is difficult to exhibit the strength of Chief Justice.
Vaughan's reasoning by detached extracts from his opinion.
But a few other passages are directly in point
"A man cannot see by another's eye, nor hear by another's
ear, no more can a man conclude or infer the thing to b&
resolved by another's understanding or reasoning; and though
the verdict be right the jury give, yet they, being not assured
it is so from their own understanding, are forsworn, at least.
ivnforo conscmenhw." p. 148.
"That decantatum in our books, ad _quwstonem'factt non reeyondent udices, ad quastonemlegzs non espondentjuratores,,
literally taken, is true for if it be demanded, What is thefact 2 the judge cannot answer it, if it be asked, What is thelaw in the case 2 the jury cannot answer it." He then explains.
this by showing that upon demurrers, special verdicts, or motions in arrest of judgment, "the jury inform the naked fact,
and the court deliver the law" "But upon all general issues,
as upon not culpable pleaded in trespass, nil debet in debt, nultort, nul dissems'&n in assize, ne disturbca pas in quare 'mnpedit,
and the like, though it be matter of law whether the defendant be a trespasser, a debtor, disseisor, or disturber, in the particular cases in issue, yet the jury find not (as in a special verdict) the fact of every case by itself, leaving the law to the
court, but find for the plaintiff or defendant upon the issue to.
be tried, wherein they resolve both law and fact complicately
and not the fact by itself, so as though they answer not singly
to the question what is the law, yet they determine the law in
all matters, where issue is joined and tried in the principal.

case, but [i.e. except] where the verdict is special." pp. 149,
150.
He then observes that "to this purpose the Lord Hobart in
NYeedlers case agaznst the Bishop of Winchester is very apposite," citing the passage quoted near the beginning of this
opinion, and concludes his main argument as follows
"The legal verdict of the jury, to be recorded, is finding
for.the plaintiff or defendant, what they answer, if asked, to
questions concermng some particular fact, is not of their verdict essentially, nor axe they bound to agree in such particulars, if they all agree to find their issue fbr the plaintiff or
defendant, they may differ in the motives wherefore [therefor],
as well as judges, in giving judgment for the plaintiff or
defendant, may differ in the reasons wherefore they give that
judgment, which is very ordinary" 1p. 150.
That judgment thus clearly appears to have been rested, not
merely on the comparatively technical ground, that upon the
general issue no matter of law could come in question until
the facts have been found by the jury, nor yet upon the old
theory that the jurors might have personal knowledge of some
facts not appearing in evidence, but mainly on the broad reasons, that if the jury, especially in criminal trials, were obliged
to follow the directions of the court in matter of law, no necessary or convenient use could be found of juries, or to continue
trials by them at all, that though the verdict of the jury be
right according to the law as laid down by the court, yet if they
are not assured by their own understanding that it is so, they
are forsworn, at least znforo conscientsm, and that the decantatum in our books, ad qumestonemfacti non respondentjudices,
ad quwstionermjurzs non re&pondent yuratores, means that issues of law, as upon demurrers, special verdicts, or motions in
arrest of judgment, are to be decided by the court, but that
upon general issues of fact, involving matter of law, the jury resolve both law and fact complicately, and so determine the law
Notwithstanding that authoritative declaration of the right
of the jury, upon the general issue, to determine the law,
Chief Tustice Scroggs, upon the trial of Harris for a seditious
libel in 1680, (7 Howell's State Trials, 925, 930,) insisted that

OCTOBER TERAI, 1894.

the jury must take the law from the court, and Chief Justice
Jeffreys, presiding at the trial of Algernon Sidney in 1683,
charged the jury as follows "It is our duty upon our oaths
to declare the law to you, and you are bound to receive our
declaration of law, and upon this declaration to inquire
whether there be a fact, sufficiently proved, to find the prisoner
guilty of the high treason of which he stands indicted." And
Sidney was convicted, sentenced, and executed. 9 Howell's
State Trials, 817, 889.
In the last year of the reign of James II, the Ti'mal of the
Seven B-ihops, reported 12 Howell's State Trials, 183, took
place upon an information for a seditious libel contained in
their petition to the King, praying that he would be pleased
not to insist on their distributing and reading in the churches
his declaration dispensing with the penal statutes concerning
the exercise of religion. The trial was at bar before all the
Justices of the King's Bench, upon a general plea of not
guilty A principal ground of defence was, that the King
had no dispensing power, and therefore the petition of the
bishops to him was an innocent exercise of the right of petition, and was not a libel. In support of this defence, ancient
acts of Parliament were given in evidence, and, upon the
offer of one in iNorman French, the Chief Justice said, "Read
it in English, for the jury to understand it," and it was so read
by a sworn interpreter. pp. 374, 375. And when the Attorney General argued that these matters were not pertinent to
the case, the Chief Justice, interrupting him, said "Yes, Mr.
Attorney, I'll tell you what they offer, which it will lie upon
you to give an answer to, they would have you show how
this has disturbed the government, or diminished the King's
authority" p. 399.
At the close of the arguments, each of the four judges in
turn charged the jury Lord Chief Justice Wright said
"The only question before me is, and so it is before you, gentlemen, it being a question of fact, whether here be a certain
proof of a publication
And then the next question is a
-question of law indeed, whether if there be a publication
proved, it be a libelS" "l{ow, gentlemen, anything that

shall disturb the government, or make mischief and a stir
among the people, is certainly within the case of Libellis Famo8sW and I must in short give you my opinion, I do take it to
be a libel. Now this being a point of law, if my brothers have
anything to say to it, I suppose they will deliver their opinions."
Mr. Justice Holloway said. "If you are satisfied there was
an ill intention of sedition, or the like, you ought to find them
guilty, but if there be nothing in the case that you find, but.
only that they did deliver a petition to save themselves harmless and to free themselves from blame, by showing the reason
of their disobedience to the King's command, which they apprehended to be a grievance to them, and which they couldnot in conscience give obedience to, I cannot think it is a libel.
It is left to you, gentlemen, but that is my opinion."
Mr. Justice Powell also expressed his opinion that the
paper was not a libel, and said "INow, gentlemen, the matter of it is before you, you are to consider of it, and it is worth
your consideration." He then expressed his opinion that the
King had no dispensing power, and concluded. "If this be
once allowed of, there will need no Parliament, all the legislation will be in the King, which is a thing worth considering,
and I leave the issue to God and your consciences."
Mr. Justice Allybone, after saying, "The single question
that falls to my share is, to give my sense of this petition,
whether it shall be in construction of law a libel in itself, or
a thing of great innocence," expressed his opinion that it was
a libel.
The jury on retiring, requested, and were allowed by the
court, to take with them the statute book, the information,
the petition of the bishops, and the declaration of the King-;
and they returned a verdict of not guilty, whereat there was
great popular rejoicing in London and throughout England.
12 Howell's State Trials, 425-431, 1 Burnet's Own Time, 44.
It thus clearly appears that upon that trial, one of the most
important in English history, deeply affecting the liberties of
the people, the four judges of the King's Bench, while differing among themselves upon the question whether the petition

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shiras, JJ.

of the bishops was a libel, concurred in submitting that question, as a question of law, to the decision of the jury, not as
umpires between those judges who thought the paper was a
libel and those judges who thought it was not, but as the
tribunal vested by the law of England with the power and
the right of ultimately determining, as between the Crown
and the accused, all matters of law, as well as of fact, involved
in the general issue of guilty or not guilty
Upon the accession of William and Mary, Parliament declared the King's power of dispensing with the laws to be
unlawful, and reversed the conviction of Algernon Sidney,
"for a partial and unjust construction of the statute" of
treasons in the instructions by which his conviction had been
procured. Stat. 1 W & M. sess. 2, c. 2, 6 Statutes of the
IRealm, 143, 155, 9 Howell's State Trials, 996. And early in
the new reign Holt was appointed Lord Chief Justice, and
Somers, Lord Keeper.
Lord Somers, in the opening pages of his essay on The
Security of Englishmen's Lives, or the Trust, Power and
Duty of the Grand Juries of England, (first published in 1681,
and republished in 1714, towards the end of his life, after he
had been Lord Chancellor,) lays down in the clearest terms
the right of the jury to decide the law, saying "It is made a
fundamental in our government, that (unless it be by Parliament) no man's life shall be touched for any crime whatsoever, save by the judgment of at least twenty-four men, that
as, twelve or more, to find the bill of indictment, whether he
be peer of the realm, or commoner, and twelve peers or
above, if a lord, if not, twelve commoners, to give the judgment upon the general issue of not guilty joined." "The
-office and power of these juries is .udiczal, they only are the
judges from whose sentence the indicted are to expect life or
death Upon their integrity and understanding, the lives of
all that are brought into judgment do ultimately depend,
from their verdict there lies no appeal, by finding guilty or
not guilty, they do complicately resolve both law and fact.
As it hath been the law, so it hath always been the custom
and practice of these juries, upon all general issues, pleaded

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

an cases, civil as well as criminal, to judge both of the law
and fact." " Our ancestors were careful, that all men of the
like condition and quality, presumed to be sensible of each
,other's infirmity, should mutually be judges of each other's
lives, and alternately taste of subjection and rule, every man
being equally liable to be accused or indicted, and perhaps to
be suddenly judged by the party, of whom he is at present
judge, if he be found innocent."
Lord Ohief Justice Holt declared that "in all cases and in
all actions the jury may give a general or special verdict, as
well in causes criminal as civil, and the court ought to receive
it, if pertinent to the point in issue, for if the jury doubt they
may refer themselves to the court, but are not bound so to
do." Anon. (1697) 3 Salk. 373. And upon the trial of an information for a seditious libel, while he expressed his opinion
that the paper was upon its face a criminal libel,,he submitted
the question whether it was such to the jury, saying, "Now
you are to consider whether these words I have read to you
do not tend to beget an ill opinion of the administration of
the government."
Tutchn's case, (1704) 14 Howell's State
Trials, 1095, 1128. Although he concluded his charge with
the words, "If you are satisfied that he is guilty of composing
and publishing these papers at London, you are to find him
guilty," yet, as Mr. Starkie well observes, "these words have
immediate reference to the ground of defence upon which
Mr. Tutchin's counsel meant to rely, namely, that the offence
had not been proved to have been committed in Lolidon, and
cannot be considered as used for the purpose of withdrawing
the attention of the jury from the quality of the publication,
upon which they had just before received instructions; and
indeed to suppose it had so meant would prove too much,
since, if so, the jury were directed not to find the truth of
the innuendoes." Starkie on Slander, 56.
Some decisions, often cited as against the right of the jury
by a general verdict to determine matter of law involved in
the general issue of guilty or not guilty, were upon special
verdicts presenting pure questions of law Such were Townsend's case, (1554) 1 Plowd. 111, and Te Zing v Oney,

After the accession of George II, Lord Chief Justice Raymiond, on trials at nts, prius for seditious libels, (ignoring the
cases of Tutchin and of The Seven Bishops,) told juries that
they were bound to take the law from the court, and that the
question, whether the paper which the defendant was accused
of writing and publishing was a libel, was a mere question of
Clarke's case,
law with which the jury had nothing to do.

In 1734, upon an information in the nature of a quo warranto
against the defendant to show cause by what authority he
acted as mayor of Liverpool, his motion for a new trial, because the jury had found a general verdict for the Crown
against the instructions of the judge, and notwithstanding he
ordered them to return a special verdict, was granted by the
Court of King's Bench, Lord Chief Justice Hardwicke saying
"The general rule is, that if the judge of ntsz yrtus directs
the jury on the point of law, and they think fit obstinately to
find a verdict contrary to his direction, that is sufficient ground
for granting a new trial, and when the judge upon a doubt of'
law directs the jury to bring in the matter specially, and they
find a general verdict, that also is a sufficient foundation for a.
new trial." "The thing that governs greatly in this determination is, that the point of law is not to be determined by
juries, juries have a power by law to determine matters of
fact only, and it is of the greatest consequence to the law of
England and to the subject, that these powers of the judgeand jury are kept distinct, that the judge determines the law,
and the jury the fact, and if ever they come to be confounded,
it will prove the confusion and destruction of the law of England." The -King v Poole, Cas. temp. Hardw 23, 26, 28,
S. C. Cunningham, 11, 14, 16.
But such an information to try title to a civil office (though
it had some of the forms of a criminal prosecution) was brought
for the mere purpose of trying a civil right, and was consid-

ered as in the nature of a civil proceeding. 3 Bi. Com. 263,
The Zing v. F~rano s, 2 T. R. 484, Ames v. Kansas, 111 U S.
449, 460, .461. And, as appears by the first passage above
cited from Lord Hardwicke's opinion, it was evidently so
treated by the court, under the practice of granting new trials
on motion of either party to a civil case, which had gradually
grown up within the century preceding, as a substitute for
attaints. Bell v Wardell, (1740) Willes, 204, 206,
i~tham
v. Lews, (1744) 1 Wilson, 48, 55, Brzght v Eynon, "(1757) 1
Burrow, 390, 394. In a criminal case, certainly, the court
could not compel the jury to return a special verdict. Nothing, therefore, was adjudged m Poole's case as to the right of
the jury to decide the law in prosecutions for crime. And it
is significant that, although both reports of that case were
published in 1770, it was not cited by Lord Mansfield, in 1784,
when collecting the authorities against the right of the jury
in criminal cases. The Zing v. Shijley, 4 Doug. 73, 168.
Lord Hardwicke's own opinion, indeed, may be presumed
to have been against the right of the jury, for when Attorney
General he had so argued in Francklin'scase, above cited, 17
Howell's State Trials, 669, and he was, as justly observed by
Mr. Hallam, "a regularly bred crown lawyer, and in his whole
life disposed to hold very high the authority of government."
3 Hallam's Const. Hist. (9th ed.) 287. His opinion, therefore,
is of less weight upon a constitutional question affecting the
liberty of the subject, than upon other questions of law or of
equity
The later history of the law of England upon the right of
the jury to decide the law in criminal cases is illustrated by a
long conflict between the views of Mr. Murray, afterwards
Lord Mansfield, against the right, and of Mr. Pratt, afterwards Lord Camden, in its favor, which, after the public
sentiment had been aroused by the great argument of Mr.
Erskane in The Dean of St. Asaph's case, was finally settled,
an accordance with Lord Camden's view, by a declaratory act
of Parliament.
Upon the Trial of. Owen, in 1752, for publishing a libel,
Mr. Murray, as Solicitor General, argued to the jury that if

they determined the question of fact of publication, the judge
determined the law But Mr. Pratt, of counsel for the defendant, argued the whole matter to the jury, and, although
the publication was fully proved, and Chief Justice Lee told
the jury that, this being so, they could not avoid bringing
in the defendant guilty, they returned and persisted in a
general verdict of acquittal. 18 Howell's State Trials, 1203,
1223, 1227, 1228, 29 Parl. Hist. 1408.
In the like case of Nutt, in 1754, (Starkie on Slander, 615,)
conducted by M£r. Murray as Attorney General, the like direction was given to the jury by Chief Justice Ryder. Lord
Mansfield, in The Zing v Shtpley, 4 Doug. 168.
In the similar case of Shebbeare, in 1758, (Starkie on
Slander, 56, 616,) Mr. Pratt, as Attorney General, when
moving before Lord Mansfield for leave to file the information, said "It is merely to put the matter in a way of trial,
for I admit, and his lordship well knows, that the jury are
judges of the law as well as the fact, and have an undoubted
right to consider whether, upon the whole, the pamphlet in
question be or be not published with a wicked, seditious
intent, and be or not a false, malicious, and scandalous libel."
Second Postscript to Letter to Mr. Almon on Libels, (1770)
p. 7, 4 Collection of Tracts 1763-1770, p. 162. And at the
trial, as he afterwards said in the House of Lords, he "went
into court predetermined to insist on the jury taking the
whole of the libel into consideration," and, "so little did he
attend to the authority of the judges on that subject, that
he turned his back on them, and directed all he had to say to
the jury " 29 Parl. Hist. 1408. And see 20 Howell's State
Trials, 709. But Lord Mansfield instructed the jury that the
question whether the publication was a libel was to be determined by the court. 4 Doug. 169.

Mansfield instructed the jury in the same way as in Shebbeare's
case. In JMiller's case, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty

In Wood.fall's case, the jury returned a verdict of "guilty of
printing and publishing only;" and the court therefore granted
a motion for a new trial. But Lord Mansfield, on November
20, 1770, in delivering a judgment upon that motion, took occasion to say that the court was of opinion "that the direction

On December 5, 177110, in the House of Lords, the judgment
in Toodfall's case was attacked by Lord Chatham, and defended by Lord Mansfield, m replying to whom Lord Chatham
said "This, my lords, I never understood to be the law of
I always understood that the
England, but the contrary
jury were competent judges of the law as well as the fact,
and, indeed, if they were not, I can see no essential benefit
from their institution to the community" And Lord Camden,
after observing that it would be highly necessary to have an
authentic statement of the direction to the jury in that case
laid before the House, said "If we can obtain this direction,
and obtain it fully stated, I shall very readily deliver my opinion upon the doctrines it inculcates, and if they appear to me
contrary to the known and the established principles of the
constitution, I.shall not scruple to tell the author of his mistake in the open face of this assembly" 16 Parl. Hist. 13021307.
On the next day, a warm debate took place in the House of
Commons upon a motion by Serjeant Glynn for a committee
"to inquire into the administration of criminal justice, and the
proceedings of the judges in Westminster Hall, particularly in
cases relating to the liberty of the press and the constitutional

and Lord Mansfield was the established law of the land. 16

Pursuant to a wish expressed by Lord Mansfield on the day
after, the House of Lords met on December 10, when he informed the House that he had left with its clerk a copy of the
judgment of the court in Woodfall's case. Lord Camden
thereupon said that he considered the paper as a challenge
directed personally to him, which he accepted, and said "In
direct contradiction to him, I maintain that his doctrine is not
the law of England. I am ready to enter into the debate
whenever the noble lord will fix a day for it." And he proposed questions in writing to Lord Mansfield, framed with the
view of ascertaining how far that judgment denied the right
of the jury, by a general verdict in a criminal case, to determine the law as well as the fact. Lord Mansfield evaded
answering the questions, and, while declaring himself ready
to discuss them at some future day, declined to name one.
And the matter dropped for the time. 16 Parl. Hist. 13121322.
In 1783, after the Independence of the United States had
been recognized by Great Britain, came the case of Rex v
Sh pley, commonly known as The Dean of St. Asaph's case,
fully reported in 4 Doug. 73, and in 21 Howell's State Trials,
847, and briefly stated in 3 T. R. 428, note, which was a crimilnal prosecution for a seditious libel contained in a pamphlet
written by Sir William Jones. Mr. Justice Buller, at the
trial, told the jury that the only questions for them were
whether the defendant published the pamphlet, and whether
the innuendoes in the indictment were true, and that the question of libel or no libel was a question of law for the court,
and not for the jury, upon which he declined to express any
opinion, but that it would be open for the consideration of
the court upon a motion in arrest of judgment. The jury
returned a verdict of "guilty of publishing only," but were
persuaded by the judge to put it in this form " Guilty of
publishing, but whether a libel or not the jury do not find."
4 Doug. 81, 82, 85, 86, 21 Howell's State Trials, 946, 950-955.
The effect of all this was that the defendant was found guilty
of publishing a paper, which neither the judge nor the jury
had held to be a libel, and judgment was ultimately arrested

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

133

upon the ground that, as set out in the indictment, it was not
libellous. 21 Howells State Trials, 1044.
But, before the motion in arrest of judgment was argued,
Mr. Erskine obtained a rule to show cause why a new trial
should not be granted, principally upon the ground that the
judge told the jury that the question whether libel or not was
not for their decision, whereas the jury, upon the general
issue, had not only the power, but the right, to decide the law
It was upon this rule that Mr. Erskine made his famous argument in support of the rights of juries, and that Lord Mansfield delivered the judgment, in which Mr. Justice Ashurst
concurred, which has since been the principal reliance of those
who deny the right of the jury to decide the law involved in
the general issue in a criminal case.
It should not be overlooked, that at the hearing of this
motion, Mr. Beareroft, the leading counsel for the Crown,
-aid he "agreed with the counsel for the defendant, that it is
the right of the jury, if they please, on the plea of not guilty,
to take upon themselves the decision of every question of law
necessary to the acquittal of the defendant, and Lord Mansfield observing that he should call it the}ower, not the rzght,
he adhered to the latter expression, and added, that he
thought it an important privilege, and which, on particular
occasions, as, for instance, if a proper censure of the measures
of the servants of the Crown were to be construed by a judge
to be libellous, it would be laudable and justifiable in them to
exercise." 4 Doug. 94, note. See also p. 108.
Mr. Justice Willes, dissenting from the opinion of the
court, said he was sure that these statements of Mr. Bearcroft
expressed "the sentiments of the greater part of Westminster
Hall;" and declared "I conceive it to be the law of this
country, that the jury, upon a plea of not guilty, or upon the
general issue, upon an indictment or an information for a libel,
have a constitutional right, if they think fit, to examine the
innocence or criminality of the paper, notwithstanding there
is sufficient proof given of the publication." "I believe no
man will venture to say they have not the power, but I mean
expressly to say they have the rzght. Where a civil power of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

this sort has been exercised without control, it presumes, nay,
by continual usage, it gives the right. It was the rght which
juries exercised in those times of violence when the Seven
Bishops were tried, and which even the partial judges who
then presided did not dispute, but authorized them to exercise
upon the subject-matter of the libel, and the jury, by their
solemn verdict upon that occasion, became one of the happy
instruments, under Providence, of the salvation of this country
This privilege has been assumed by the jury in a variety of
ancient and modern instances, and particularly in the case of
Riex v Owen, without any correction or even reprimand of the
court. It is a right, for the most cogent reasons, lodged in the
jury, as without this restraint the subject in bad times would
have no security for his life, liberty, or property " And he
concurred in refusing a new trial, solely because in his opinion
neither the counsel for the prosecution, nor the judge presiding
at the trial, had impugned these doctrines, and the verdict returned by the jury was in the nature of a special yerdict, in
effect submitting the law to the court. 4 Doug. 171-175.
In 1789, in The Zing v Withers, 3 T. ZR. 428, Lord Kenyon
instructed a jury in the same way that Mr. Justice Buller had
done in The Dean of St. Asayh's case.
In 1791, the declaratory statute, entitled "An act to remove
doubts respecting the functions of juries in cases of libel,"
and known as Fox's Libel Act, was introduced in Parliament,
and was passed in 1792. Stat. 32 Geo. III, c. 60.
By that act, "the legislature," as lately observed by Lord
Blackburn in the House of Lords, "adopted almost the words
and quite the substance" of that passage of the opinion of Mr.
Justice Willes, first quoted above. Captaland Countes Bank
v. Henty, 7 App. Gas. 741, 775.
The doubts which the act was passed to remove were, as
recited at the beginning of the act, upon the question whether
upon the trial of an indictment or information for libel, on the
plea of not guilty, "it be competent to the jury impanelled
to try the same to give their verdict upon the whole matter
put in issue," and it was "therefore declared and enacted,"
(not merely enacted, but declared to be the law as already

SPAIRF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

Gray, Shiras, JJ.

existing,) "that on every such trial the jury sworn to try the
issue may give a general verdict of guilty or not guilty upon
the whole matter put in issue upon such indictment or information, and shall not be required or directed, by the court or
judge before whom such indictment or information shall be
tried, to find the defendant or defendants guilty, merely on
the proof of the publication by such defendant or defendants
of the paper charged to be a libel, and of the sense ascribed to
the same in such indictment or information."
The act then provides, first, that the presiding judge may,
at his discretion, give instructions to the jury, second, that
the jury may, at their discretion, return a special verdict, and
third, that the defendant, if found guilty, may move in arrest
of judgment. The first of these provisos, and the only one
requiring particular notice, is that the judge shall, at his discretion, give "his opinion and directions to the jury on the
matter at issue," " in like manner as in other criminal cases."
His "opinion and directions" clearly means by way of advice
and instruction only, and not by way of order or command,
and the explanation, "in like manner as in other criminal
cases," shows that no peculiar rule was intended to be laid
down in the case of libel. And that this was the understanding at the tine is apparent from the debate on the proviso,
which was adopted on the motion of Sir John Scott, (then
Solicitor General, and afterwards Lord Eldon,) just before the
bill passed the House of Commons in 1791. 29 Parl. Hist.
594-602.
The clear effect of the whole act is to declare that the
jury (after receiving the instructions of the judge, if he sees
fit to give any instructions) may decide, by a general verdict,
"the whole matter put in issue," which necessarily includes
all questions of law, as well as of fact, involved in the general
issue of guilty or not guilty, and to recognize the same rule
as existing in all criminal cases.
Not only is this the clear meaning of the words of the act,
but that such was its intent and effect is shown by the grounds.
taken by its supporters and its opponents in Parliament, as.
well as by subsequent judicial opinions in England.

Mr. Fox, upon moving the introduction of the bill in the
House of Commons in 1791, after observing that he was not
ignorant that power and right were not convertible terms,
said that, "if a power was vested in any person, it was surely
meant to be exercised," that "there was a power vested in
the jury to judge the law and fact, as often as they were
united, and if the jury were not to be understood to have a
right to exercise that power, the constitution would never
have entrusted them with it," "but they knew it was the
province of the jury to judge of law and fact, and this was
the case not of murder only, but of felony, high treason, and
of every other criminal indictment," and that "it must be
left in all cases to a jury to infer the guilt of men, and an
English subject could not lose his life but by a judgment of
his peers." 29 Parl. Hist. 564, 565, 597 And Mr. Pitt, in
supporting the bill, declared that his own opinion was against
the practice of the judges, "and that he saw no reason why,
in the trial of a libel, the whole consideration of the case
might not go precisely to the unfettered judgment of twelve
men, sworn to give their verdict honestly and conscientiously,
as it did in matters of felony and other crimes of a high
nature." 29 Parl. Hist. 588.
In the debate in the House of Lords, on a motion of Lord
Chancellor Thurlow to put off the reading of the bill, Lord
Camden said, "He would venture to affirm, and should not be
afraid of being contradicted by any professional man, that by
the law of England as it now stood, the jury had a right, in
deciding on a libel, to judge whether it was criminal or not,
and juries not only possessed that right, but they had exercised
it in various instances." He added, as "a matter which he
conceived should be imprinted on every juror's mind, that if
they found a verdict of the publishing, and left the criminality
to the judge, they had to answer to God and their consciences
for the punishment that might, by such judge, be inflicted on
the defendant, whether it was fine, nnprisonment, loss of ears,
whipping, or any other disgrace, which was the sentence of
the court." After further enforcing his opinion, he said "I
will affirm that they have that right, and that there is no

SPAR F AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

137

power by the law of this country to prevent them from the
exercise of that right, if they think fit to maintain it, and
when they are pleased to acquit any defendant, their acquittal
will stand good until the law of England is changed." "My
lords," said he, "give to the jury or to the judge the right of
trial of the subjects of this country, you must give it to one
of them, and I think you can have no difficulty which to prefer." And he concluded by saying that "he did not apprehend that the bill had a tendency to alter the law, but merely
to remove doubts that ought never to have been entertained,
and therefore the bill had his hearty concurrence, but, as he
was assured that the proposed delay was not hostile to the
principle of the bill, but only to take it into serious consideration, and to bring it again forward, he had no objection to the
motion of the Lord Chancellor." 29 Parl. Hist. 729, 730, 732.
In the House of Lords in 1792, the bill ha ing again passed
the House of Commons, Lord Loughborough, for many years
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, said that he "had ever
deemed it his duty, in cases of libel, to state the law as it bore
on the facts, and to refer the combined consideration to the
jury," and that "their decision was final. There was no
control upon them in their verdict. The evident reason and
good sense of this was, that every man was held to be acquainted
with the criminal law of the land. Ignorance was no plea for
the comnnssion of a crime, and no man was therefore supposed
to be ignorant of judging upon the evidence adduced of the
guilt or innocence of a defendant. It was the admitted maxim
of law, ad quwstionem.yurizs ,esondeantjudices,ad quwestzonem
facts juratores, but when the law and the fact were blended,
it was the undoubted right of the jury to decide. If the law
was put to them fairly, there was undoubtedly not one case in
a thousand on which they would not decide properly If they
were kept in the dark, they were sometimes led into wrong,
through mere jealousy of their own right." 29 Parl. Hist.
1296, 1297.
Pending the debate, the House of Lords put questions to
the judges, who returned an opinion, in which, after saying
that "the general criminal law of England is the law of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shiras, JJ.

libel," they laid down, as a fundamental proposition, applicable to treason as well as to other crimes, "that the criminality
or innocence of any act done (which includes any paper
written) is the result of the judgment which the law pronounces upon that act, and must therefore be in all cases, and
under all circumstances, matter of law and not matter of fact."
With such a basis, it is hardly to be wondered at that they
"conceived the law to be that the judge is to declare to the
jury what the law is," and "that it is the duty of the jury, if
they will find a general verdict upon the whole matter in
issue, to compound that verdict of the fact as it appears in
evidence before them, and of the law as it is declared to them
by the judge." The judges, however, "took this occasion to
observe" that they had "offered no opinion which will have
the effect of taking matter of law out of a general issue, orout of a general verdict," and "disclaimed the folly of undertaking to prove that a jury, who can find a general verdict,
cannot take upon themselves to deal with matter of law arising
in a general issue, and to hazard a verdict made up of the fact,
and of the matter of law, according to their conception of
that law, against all direction by the judge." 29 Parl. Hist.
1361-1369.
On Lord Camden's motion, the bill was postponed, m order
to enable the House to consider the opinion of the judges,
and was then proceeded with, when Lord Camden " exposed
the fallacy of the pretended distinction between law and fact,
in the question of guilty or not guilty of printing and publishing a libel, they were united as much as intent and action m
the consideration of all other criminal proceedings. Without
an implied malice a man could not be found guilty, even of
murder. The simple killing a man was nothing, until it was
proved that the act arose from malice. A man might kill
another in his own defence, or under various circumstances
which rendered the killing no murder. How were these
things to be explained? by the circumstances of the case.

intention upon an indictment for murder, and not to judge
of the intention of the party upon libel." And Lord Loughborough, as well as Lord Camden, distinctly affirmed, and
Lord Thurlow as distinctly demed, that upon the general issue
m criminal cases, after the judge had stated the law to the
jury, the jury were to decide both the question of law and thequestion of fact. 29 Par]. ]Iist. 1370, 1405, 1406, 1426, 1429)_
Towards the close of the debate, Lord Thurlow moved to,
amend the bill by inserting the words "that the judge state
to the jury the legal effect of the record." Lord Camden
successfully opposed the amendment, "as an attempt indirectly to convert the bill into the very opposite of what it
was intended to be, and to give the judges a power ten times
greater than they had ever yet exercised," and said, "He.
must contend, that the jury had an undoubted right to form
their verdict themselves according to their consciences, applying the law to the fact, if it were otherwise, the first principle
of the law of England would be defeated and overthrown. If
the twelve judges were to assert the contrary again and again,
he would deny it utterly, because every Englishman was to.
be tried by his country, and who was his country but his.
twelve peers, sworn to condemn or acquit according to their
consciences 2 If the opposite doctrine were to obtain, trial by
jury would be a nominal trial, a mere form, for, in fact, the
judge, and not the jury, would try the man. He would contend for the truth of this argument to the latest hour of his
life, manibus pedibusque. With regard to the judge stating
to the jury what the law was upon each particular case, it was
his undoubted duty so to do, but having done so, the jury
were to take both law and fact into their consideration, and
to exercise their discretion and discharge their consciences."
29 Parl. Hist. 1535, 1536.
The first ground of the protest of Lord Thurlow, Lord
Bathurst, Lord Kenyon and three other lords against the
passage of the act was "because the rule laid down by the
bill, contrary to the determination of the judges and the unvaried practice of ages, subverts a fundamental and important
principle of English jurisprudence, which, leaving to the jury

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

the trial of the fact, reserves to the court the decision of the
law"
29 Parl. Hist. 1537.
Lord Brougham, in his sketch of Lord Camden, declares
that "the manly firmness which he uniformly displayed in
maintaining the free principles of the constitution, wholly
unmixed with any leaning towards extravagant popular opinions, or any disposition to court vulgar favour, justly entitles
him to the very highest place among the judges of England;"
-and, speaking of his conduct in carrying the libel bill through
the House of Lords, says that "nothing can be more refreshing
to the lovers of liberty, or more gratifying to those who venerate the judicial character, than to contemplate the glorious
struggle for his long-cherished principles with which Lord
Camden's illustrious life closed," and quotes some of his
statements, above cited, as passages upon which "the mind
fondly and reverently dwells," "hopeful that future lawyers
and future judges may emulate the glory and the virtue of
this great man." 3 Brougham's Statesmen of George III,
(ed. 1843,) 156, 178, 179.
In the well known case of The King v Burdett, 3 B. & Ald.
717, and 4 B. & Ald. 95, S. C. 1 State Trials (N. S.) 1, for
publishing a seditious libel, Mr. Justice Best (afterwards Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, and Lord Wynford) told the
jury that in his opinion the publication was a libel, that they
were to decide whether they would adopt his opinion, but
that they were to take the law from him, unless they were
satisfied that he was wrong. 4 B. & Ald. 131, 147, 183. The
defendant having been convicted, the Court of King's Bench,
upon a motion for a new trial, held, after advisement, that this
instruction was correct.
Mr. Justice Best said "It must not be supposed that the
statute of George III made the question of libel a question of
fact. If it had, instead of removing an anomaly, it would
have created one. Libel is a question of law, and the judge
is the judge of the law in libel as in all other cases, the jury
having the power of acting agreeably to his statement of the
law or not. All that the statute does is to prevent the question from being left to the jury in the narrow way in which

it was left before that time. The jury were then only to find
the fact of the publication, and the truth of the innuendoes,
for the judges used to tell them that the intent was an inference of law, to be drawn from the paper, with which the jury
had nothing to do. The legislature has said that that is not
so, but that the whole case is to be left to the jury But judges.

them what is the law, though they may find against him,
unless they are satisfied with his opinion. And this is plain
from the words of the statute." d: B. & Ald. 131, 132.
Justices Holroyd and Bayley and Chief Justice Abbott.
(afterwards Lord Tenterden) expressed the same view 4 B. &
Ald. 145-147, 183, 184. Mr. Justice Bayley said "The old
rule of law is, ad questionem jyurs reespondent 7udices, ad
,quastionemfacti respondent juratores, and I take it to be
the bounden duty of the judge to lay down the law as it
strikes him, and that of the jury to accede to it, unless they
have superior knowledge on the subject and the direction in
this case did nottake away from the jury the power of acting
on their own judgment." And the Chief Justice said "If
the judge is to give his opimon to the jury, as in other criminal cases, it must be not only competent but proper for him
to tell the jury, if the case will so warrant, that in his opinion,
the publication before them is of the character and tendency
attributed to it by the indictment, and that, if it be so in
their opinion, the publication is an offence against the law "
"The statute was not intended to confine the matter in issue
exclusively to the juy without hearing the opinion of the
judge, but to declare that they should be at liberty to exercise their own judgment upon the whole matter in issue, after
receiving thereupon the opinion and directions of the judge."
The weight of this deliberate and unanimous declaration of
the rightful power of the jury to decide the law in criminal
cases is not impaired by the oiter dictum hastily uttered and
promptly recalled by Chief Justice Best in the civil case, summarily decided upon a narrower point, of Lem v Afilne, and,

reported so differently in 4 Bing. 195, and in 12 J B. Moore,
418, as to leave it doubtful what he really said. And according to later English authorities, even in civil actions, the question of libel or no libel may be submitted by the judge to the
jury without expressing his own opinion upon it. Parmiter

It is to be remembered, that by the law of England, a
person convicted of treason or felony could not appeal, or
move for a new trial, or file a bill of exceptions, or in any
other manner obtain a judicial review of rulings or instructions not appearing upon the record, unless the judge himself saw fit to reserve the question for the opinion of all the
judges. In short, as observed by Dr. Lushington in delivering judgment in the Privy Council, "The prisoner has no legal
right, in the proper sense of the term, to demand a reconsideration, by a court of law, of the verdict, or of any legal objection raised at the trial." The Queen v Edu'ee Byramee, 5

520, 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 622, 65d:, 3 Russell on Crimes, (9th
ed.,) 212. Consequently, a prisoner tried before an arbitrary,
corrupt or ignorant judge had no protection but in the conscience and the firmness of the jury
There is no occasion further to pursue the examination of
modern English authorities, because in this country, from the
time of its settlement until more than half a century after the
Declaration of Independence, the law as to the rights of
juries, as generally understood and put in practice, was more
in accord with the views of Bacon, Hale, Vaughan, Somers,
Holt and Camden, than with those of Kelyng, Scroggs, Jeffreys, Raymond, Hardwicke and Mansfield. Upon a constitutional question, affecting the liberty of the subject, there
can be no doubt that the opinions of Somers and of Camden,
especially, were of the very highest authority, and were so
considered by the founders of the Republic.
In Massachusetts, the leading authorities upon the question,

adoption of the Constitution of the United States, are John
!Adams and Theophilus Parsons, each of whom was appointed,
with the general approval of the bar and the people, Chief

-Justice of the State, the one, appointed to that office by the
.revolutionary government in 1775, resigning it the next year,

iremaining in the Continental Congress to support the Declaration of Independence, and afterwards the first Vice-President
:and the second President of the United States, the other, a
leading supporter of the Constitution of the United States in
the convention of 1788 by which Massachusetts ratified the
,Constitution, appointed by President Adams in 1801 Attorney General of the United States, but declining that office,
.and becoming Chief Justice of Massachusetts in 1806.
John Adams, writing in 1771, said " Juries are taken, by
lot or by suffrage, from the mass of the people, and no man
-can be condemned of life, or limb, or property, or reputation,
without the concurrence of the voice of the people.'" "The
British empire has been much alarmed, of late years, with
-doctrines concerning juries, their powers and duties, which
have been said, in printed papers and pamphlets, to have been
-delivered from the highest tribunals of justice. Whether
these accusations are just-or not, it is certain that many per'sons are misguided and deluded by them to such a degree,
-that we often hear in conversation doctrines advanced for
law, which, if true, would render juries a mere ostentation
.and pageantry, and the court absolute judges of law and
fact." "Whenever a general verdict is found, it assuredly
-determines both the fact and the law It was never yet disputed or doubted that a general verdict, given under the direc.ton f the court in point of law, was a legal determination of
the issue. Therefore the jury have the power of deciding an
issue upon a general verdict. And, if they have, is it not an
.absurdity to suppose that the law would oblige them to find
.a verdict according to the direction of the court, against their
own opinion, judgment and conscience 2 " "The general rules
of law and common regulations of society, under which ordimary transactions arrange themselves, are well enough known

are intimately known, they are sensibly felt by every Briton,
it is scarcely extravagant to say they are drawn in and imbibed with the nurse's milk and first air. Now, should the
melancholy case arise that the judges should give their opinions to the jury against one of these fundamental principles, is
a juror obliged to give his verdict generally, according to this
direction, or even to find the fact specially, and submit the
law to the court 9, Every man, of any feeling or conscience,
will answer, No. It is not only his right, but his duty, in
that case, to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court." "The English law obliges
no man to decide a cause upon oath against his own judgment." 2 John Adams's Works, 253-255.
Theophilus Parsons, in the Massachusetts convention of
1788, answering the objection that the Constitution of the
United States, as submitted to the people for adoption, contained no bill of rights, said "The people themselves have
it in their power effectually to resist usurpation, without being
driven to an appeal to arms. An act of usurpation is not obligatory, it is not law; and any man may be justified in his resistance. Let him be considered as a criminal by the general
government, yet only his fellow-citizens can convict him, they
are his jury, and if they pronounce him innocent, not all the
powers of Congress can hurt him, and innocent they certainly will pronounce him, if the supposed law he resisted
was an act of usurpation." 2 Elliot's Debates, 94, 2 Bancroft's History of the 'Constitution, 267.
In 1808, Chief Justice Parsons, in delivering judgment in a
civil action for slander, said "Both parties have submitted
the trial of this issue to a jury The issue involved both law
and' fact, and the jury must decide the law and the fact. To
enable them to settle the fact, they were to weigh the testimony, that they might truly decide the law, they were
entitled to the assistance of the judge- If the judge had
declined his aid in a matter of law, yet the jury must have
formed their conclusion of law as correctly as they were
able." And, as the reporter states, "In this opinion of the

Chief Justice, the other judges, viz. Sedgwick, Sewall, Thatcher
and Parker, severally declared their full and entire concurrence." 0offln v Coffin, 4 Mass. 1, 25, 37.
In 18"16, upon the trial of an indictment for murder, the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, held by Chief
Justice Parker and Justices Jackson and Putnam, instructed
the jury as follows "In all capital cases, the jury are the
judges of the law and fact. The court are to direct them in
matters of law, and although it is safer for them to rely on
the instructions derived from that source, still, gentlemen,
they are to decide for themselves." Bowen's Trial, 51.
In 1826, Mr. Justice Wilde, speaking for the whole court,
assumed, as unquestionable, that "in criminal prosecutions
the jury are the judges of both law and fact." Commonwealth v. Worcester, 3 Pick. 462, 475.
In 1830, in a celebrated trial for murder, before Justices
Putnam, Wilde and Morton, the right and duty of the jury
to decide the law as well as the fact involved in the general
issue were recognized and affirmed in the charge to the jury,
and were distinguished from the right of deciding questions
of evidence, as follows "As the jury have the right, and if
required by the prisoner are bound, to return a general verdict
of guilty or not guilty, they must necessarily, in the discharge
of this duty, decide such questions of law, as well as of fact,
as are involved in this general question, and there is no mode
in which their opinons upon questions of law can be reviewed
by this court or by any other tribunal. But this does not
diminish the obligation resting upon -the court to explain the
law, or their responsibility for the correctness of the principles of law by them laid down. The instructions of the
court in matters of law may safely guide the consciences of
the jury, unless they know them to be wrong. And %Nhen
the jury undertake to decide the law (as they undoubtedly
have the power to do) in opposition to the advice of the court,
they assume a high responsibility, and should be very .careful to see clearly that they are right. Although the jury
have the power, and it is their duty, to decide all points of
law which are involved in the general question of the guilt or

innocence of the prisoner, yet when questions of law arise in
the arraignment of the prisoner, or in the progress of the
trial, in relation to the admissibility of evidence, they must be
decided by the court, and may not afterwards be reviewed by
the jury" Commonwealth v KYnapp, 10 Pick. 477, 496.
Many other Massachusetts authorities, from the earliest
times to the date last mentioned, tending to maintain the
right of the jury to decide the law involved in the general
issue, are collected in the opinion of Mr. Justice Thomas in 5
Gray, 275-280, and in a note to Quincy's Reports, 558-560,
563-567.
To that date, or later, the right of the jury in criminal cases
to decide both the law and the fact, even against the directions
of the court, was certainly recognized and acted on throughout New England, unless in Rhode Island. State v Sno~w,

In the Province of lNew York, in 1702, on the trial of Colonel Nicholas Bayard for high treason, it was argued by his
counsel, and not denied by the court, that the jury, upon the
general issue of not guilty, were judges as well of matter of
law as of matter of fact. 14 Howell's State Trials, 471, 502,
503, 505.
In the same Province, in 1735. upon the trial of John Peter
Zenger, for a seditious libel, his counsel, Andrew Hamilton, of
Philadelphia, while admitting that the jury might, if they
pleased, find the defendant guilty of printing and publishing,
and leave it to the court to judge whether the words were
libellous, said, without contradiction by the court "But I do
likewise know they may do otherwise. I know they have the
right, beyond all dispute, to determine both the law and the
fact, and where they do not doubt of the law, they ought to
do so." The court 'afterwards submitted to the jury, in the

words set forth were libellous. And Zenger was acquitted by
the jury 17 Howell's State Trials, 675, 706, 716, 722.
Upon the trial in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, in 1803, of an indictment for a libel on the President of
the United States, Chief Justice Lewis instructed the jury,
among other things, that the question of libel or no libel was
an inference of law from the fact, and that the law as laid
down by Lord Mansfield in The Dean of St. Asaph's case was
the law of this State. The defendant was convicted, and
brought the question of the correctness of these instructions
before the full court in 180d: upon a motion for a new trial.
People v Croswell, 3 Johns. Cas. 337, 341, 342.
Alexander Hamilton was of counsel for the defendant.
Two reports of his argument upon that motion have come
down to us, the one in 3 Johns. Cas. 352-362, the other in a
contemporary pamphlet of the speeches in the case, pp. 62-78,
and reprinted in 7 11amilton's Works, (ed. 1886,) 336-373.
But the most compact and trustworthy statement of his position upon the general question, unsurpassed for precision and
force by anything on the subject to be found elsewhere, is in
three propositions upon his brief, (7 Hamilton's Works, 335,
336,) read by him in recapitulating his argument, (3 Johns.
Cas. 361, 362,) which were as follows
"That in the general distribution of powers in our system
of jurisprudence, the cognizance of law belongs to the court,
of fact to the jury, that as often as they are not blended, the
power of the court is absolute and exclusive. That in civil
cases it is always so, and may rightfully be so exerted. That
in criminal cases, the law and fact being always blended, the
jury, for reasons of a political and peculiar nature, for the
security of life and liberty, is entrusted with the power of deciding both law and fact.
"That this distinction results 1, from the ancient forms of
pleading in civil cases, none but special pleas being allowed in
matter of law; in criminal, none but the general issue, 2,
from the liability of the jury to attaint in civil cases, and the

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

general power of the court as its substitute in granting new
trials, and from the exemption of the jury from attaint in
criminal cases, and the defect of power to control their
verdicts by new trials, the test of every legal power being its
capacity to produce a definitive effect, liable neither to punishment nor control.
"That in criminal cases, nevertheless, the court are the
constitutional advisers of the jury in matter of law, who may
compromit their conscience by lightly or rashly disregarding
that advice, but may still more compromit their consciences
by following it, if exercising their judgments with discretion
and honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of
the court is wrong."
The court was equally divided in opinion, Judge Kent
(afterwards Chief Justice and Chancellor) and Judge Thompson being in favor of a new trial, and Chief Justice Lewis and
Judge Livingston against it. Judge Kent drew up a careful
opinion, in which he reviewed the leading English authorities,
and from which the following passages are taken
"In every criminal case, upon the plea of not guilty, the
jury may, and indeed they must, unless they choose to find a
special verdict, take upon themselves the decision of the law,
as well as the fact, and bring in a verdict as comprehensive as
the issue, because, in every such case, they are charged with
the deliverance of the defendant from the crime of which he
is accused." "The law and fact are so involved, that the jury
are under an indispensable necessity to decide both, unless
they separate them by a special verdict. This right in the
jury to determine the law as well as the fact has received the
sanction of some of the highest authorities in the law"
"But while the power of the jury is admitted, it is denied
that they can rzghtflly or lawfully exercise it, without compromitting their consciences, and that they are bound implicitly, in all cases, to receive the law from the court. The law
must, however, have intended, in granting this power to a
jury, to grant them a lawful and rightful power, or it would
have provided a remedy against the undue exercise of it.
The true criterion of a legal power is its capacity to produce

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

149

a definitive effect, liable neither to censure nor review And
the verdict of not guilty, in a criminal case, is, in every
respect, absolutely final. The jury are not liable to punishment, nor the verdict to control. No attaint lies, nor can a,
new trial be awarded. The exercise of this power in the jury
has been sanctioned, and upheld in constant activity, from
the earliest ages." 3 Johns. Cas. 366-368.
"The result from this view is, to my mind, a firm conviction that this court is not bound by the decisions of Lord
Raymond and his successors. By withdrawing from the jury
the consideration of the essence of the charge, they render
their function nugatory and contemptible. Those opinions
are repugnant to the more ancient authorities which had
given to the jury the power, and with it the right, to judge
of the law and fact, when they were blended by the issue,
and which rendered their decisions, in criminal cases, final
and conclusive. The English bar steadily resisted those
decisions, as usurpations on the rights of the jury Some of
the judges treated the doctrine as erroneous, and the Parliament, at last, declared it an innovation, by restoring the trial
by jury, in cases of libel, to that ancient vigour and independence, by which it had grown so precious to the nation, as the
guardian of liberty and life, against the power of the court,
the vindictive persecution of the prosecutor, and the oppression of the government.
"I am aware of the objection to the fitness and competency
of a jury to decide upon questions of law, and, especially, with
a power to overrule the directions of the judge. In the first
place, however, it is not likely often to happen, that the jury
will resist the opinion of the court on the matter of law
That opinion will generally receive its due weight and effect,
and-in civil cases it can, and always ought to be ultimately
enforced by the power of setting aside the verdict. But in
human institutions, the question is not, whether every evil
contingency can be avoided, but what arrangement will be
productive of the least inconvenience. And it appears to be
most consistent with the permanent security of the subject,
that m criminal cases the jury should, after receiving the

advice and assistance of the judge as to the law, take into
their consideration all the circumstances of the case, and the
intention with which the act was done, and to determine upon
the whole, whether the act done be, or be not, within the
meaning of the law This distribution of power, by which the
court and jury mutually assist, and mutually check each other,
seems to be the safest, and consequently the wisest arrangement, in respect to the trial of crimes. The constructions of
judges, on the intention of the party, may often be (with the
most upright motives) too speculative and refined, and not
altogether just in their application to every case. Their rules
may have too technical a cast, and become, in their operation,
severe and oppressive. To judge accurately of motives and
intentions does not require a master's skill in the science of
the law It depends more on a knowledge of the passions,
and of the springs of human action, and may be the lot of

ordinary experience and sagacity"
In April, 1805, the legislature of New York passed a statute,
very like Fox's Libel Act, declaring that upon an indictment
or information for libel, "the jury who shall try the same
shall have a right to determine the law and the fact, under
the direction of the court, in like manner as in other criminal
cases." And the reporter notes that, "in consequence of this
declaratory statute, the court, in August term, 1805, (no
motion having been made for judgment on the verdict,) unanimously awarded a new trial in the above cause." 3 Johns.
Gas. 4:12, 413.
In 1825, Judge Walworth (afterwards Chancellor) presiding
in a court of oyer and terminer, at trials of indictments for
murder, instructed the jury "that in criminal trials, they had
a right to decide both as to the law and the facts of the case,
that the court was bound, by the oaths of office of its judges,
honestly and impartially to decide the questions of law arising
in the case, and state them to the jury, but the jury had a
right to disregard the decision of the court upon questions of
law, especially in favor of life, if they were fully satisfied that
such decision was wrong." People v Jhayers, 1 Parker's

In New Jersey, by Provincial laws of 1676 and 1681, it
was not only enacted "that the trial of all causes, civil and
criminal, shall be heard and decided by the verdict of twelve
honest men of the neighbourhood ;" but also "1that there shall
be, in every court, three justices or commissioners, who shall
sit with the twelve men of the neighbourhood, with them to
hear all causes, and to assist the said twelve men of the
neighbourhood in case of law, and that they the said justices
shall pronounce such judgment as they shall receive from,
and be directed by the said twelve men, in whom only the
judgment resides, and not otherwise, and, in case of their
neglect and refusal, that then one of the twelve, by consent
of the rest, pronounce their own judgment as the justices
should have done." Leaming & Spicer's Laws, pp. 396-398,
428, 429. How far, under the present constitution and laws
of the State, juries, in criminal cases, have the right to decide
the law for themselves, disregarding the instructions of the
judge presiding at the trial, does not appear to be settled.

habeas corpus, cited in the earlier part of this opinion, as well
as to the argument of Andrew Hamilton, of Philadelphia,

to decide both law and fact (notwithstanding opinions to the
contrary, expressed near the end of the last century by a
judge of a county court in charging juries and grand juries,

of the bar, it was treated by the Court of Appeals as doubtful.

In Illinois, the criminal code having declared that "juries in

the instructions of the judge as the juror's opimon of the law
might dictate. The judge instructed the jury that they must
take the law as laid down to them by the court, and could not
-determine for themselves whether the law so given to them
was or was not the law Upon exception to the instructions,
the -Supreme Court of Illinois, speaking by Judge Breese,
granted a new trial and said "Being judges of the law and

court, but can assume the responsibility of deciding, each
juror for himself, what the law is. If they can say, upon
their oaths, that they know the law better than the court, they
have the power so to do. If they are prepared to say the law
is different from what it is declared to be by the court, they
have a perfect legal right to say so, and find the verdict according to their own notions of the law It is a matter between
their consciences and their God, with which no power can

In the Declaration of Rights unanimously adopted October

George Washington and Patrick Henry were members, it was
resolved "that the respective Colonies are entitled to the
common law of England, and more especially to the great and
inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law"
1 Journals of Congress, 28.
The Constitution of the United States, as framed in 1787
and adopted in 1788, ordained, in art. 3, sect. 3, that "the trial
of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury;
and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime
shall have been committed," and, in the Fifth, Sixth and
Seventh Amendments adopted in 1791, "nor shall any person
be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of
life or limb," "nor be deprived of life, liberty or property,
without due process of law," "in all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,
by an impartial\jury of the State and district wherein the
crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been
previously ascertained by law;" and "in suits at common law,
where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,
the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried
by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the
United States, than according to the rules of the common law"
Within six years after the Constitution was established, the
right of the jury, upon the general issue, to determine the law
as well as the fact in controversy, was unhesitatingly and unqualifiedly affirmed by this court, m the first of the very few
trials by jury ever had at its bar, under the original jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Constitution.
That trial took place at February term, 1794, in Georgia v
Braiiford,3 Dall. 1, which was an action at law by the State
of Georgia against Brailsford and others, British subjects.
The pleadings, as appears by the files of this court, were as

follows The declaration was in assumpsit for money had and
received, the defendants pleaded non assumsit, and "put
themselves upon the country," and the replication was, "And
the said State of Georgia also putteth herself upon the country" The action, as the report shows, was brought to recovermoneys received by the defendants upon a bond of a citizen of
Georgia to them, to which the State of Georgia claimed title
under an act of confiscation passed by that State in 1782, during the Revolutionary War, under circumstances which were
agreed to be as stated in the suit in equity between the sameparties, reported m 2 Dall. 402, 415. After the casehad been
argued for four days to the court and jury, Chief Justice Jay,
on February 7,1794, as the report states, "delivered the following charge "
"This cause has been regarded as of great importance, and
doubtless it is so. It has accordingly been treated by the
counsel with great learning, diligence and ability, and on
your part it has been heard with particular attention. It is,
therefore, unnecessary for me to follow the investigation over
the extensive field into which it has been carried, you are
now, if ever you can be, completely possessed of the merits of
the cause.
"The facts comprehended in the case are agreed, the only
point that remains is to settle what is the law of the land
arising from those facts, and on that point, it is proper that.
the opinion of the court should be given. It is fortunate on
the present, as it must be on every occasion, to find the opinion of the court unanimous; we entertain no diversity of sentiment, and we have experienced no difficulty in uniting in
the charge which it is my province to deliver."
The Chief Justice, after stating the opinion of the court im
favor of the defendants upon the questions of law, proceeded
as follows "It may not be amiss, here, gentlemen, to remind
you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact it is the
province of the jury, on questions of law it is the province of
the court to decide. But it must be observed that by the
same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of
jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon your-

selves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as
the fact in controversy On this, and on every other occasion,
however, we have no doubt you will pay that respect which is
due to the opinion of the court, for, as on the one hand, it is
presumed that juries are the best judges of facts, it is, on the
other hand, presumable that the court are the best judges of
law But still both objects are lawfully within your power
of decision."
Then, after telling the jury that they should not be influenced by a consideration of the comparative situations and
means of the parties, he concluded the charge thus "Go,
then, gentlemen, from the bar, without any impressions of
favor or prejudice for the one party or the other, weigh well
the merits of the case, and do on this, as you ought to do on
every occasion, equal and impartial justice." The jury, after
coming into court, and requesting and receiving further explanations of the questions of law, returned a verdict for the
defendants, without going again from the bar. 3 Dall. 3-5.
The report shows that, in a case in which there was no controversy about the facts, the court, while stating to the jury
its unanimous opinion upon the law of the case, and reminding
them of "the good old rule, that on questions of fact it is the
province of the jury, on questions of law it is the province of
the court to decide," expressly informed them that "by the
same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of
jurisdiction," the jury "have nevertheless a right to take upon
themselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well
as the fact in controversy"
The court at that time consisted of Chief Justice Jay, and
Justices Cushing, Wilson, Blair, Iredell and Paterson, all of
whom, (as appears by its records,) except Justice Iredell, were
present at the trial.
The doubts which have been sometimes expressed of the
.accuracy of Mr. Dallas's report are unfounded, as is apparent
from several considerations. He was of counsel for the plaintiff. The court was then held at Philadelphia, and there is
no reason to doubt that the practice mentioned in the preface
to his first volume containing reports of cases in the courts of

to the press, underwent the examination of the presiding
judge of the court in which it was determined," was continued in his succeeding volumes contaimng "reports of casesruled and adjudged in the several courts of the United States,
and of Pennsylvania, held at the seat of the Federal Government." The charge contains internal evidence of being reported verbatim, and has quotation marks at the end, although
they are omitted at the beginning. And the charge, m thesame words, with the prefix that it "was delivered by Jay,
Chief Justice, on the 7th of February, in the following
terms," is printed in Dunlop and Olaypole's American Daily
Advertiser of February 17, 1794.
That was not a criminal case, nor a suit to recover a penalty, had it been, it could hardly have been brought within
the original jurisdiction of this court. Wisconsm v. Pelican
Ins. Co., 127 U. S. 265, 294, 295. But it was a suit by a Stateto assert a title acquired by an act of its legislature in the
exercise of its sovereign powers in time of war against privateindividuals. As the charge of the court dealt only with the
case before it, without any general discussion, it does not.
appear whether the opinion expressed as to the right of thejury to determine the law was based upon a supposed analogy
between such a suit and a prosecution for crime, or upon thetheory, countenanced by many American authorities of theperiod, that at the foundation of the Republic as in early
times in England, the right of the jury extended to all cases,.
civil or criminal, tried upon the general issue.
However that may have been, it cannot be doubted thatthis court, at that early date, was of opinion that the jury

which any reports are known to exist, tend, more or less
-directly, to affirm this right of the jury That there is not a
greater accumulation of evidence to this effect is easily accounted for when it is remembered that domparatively few
reports of trials were printed, and that the right of the jury
was considered to be so well settled, that it was seldom controverted in practice, or specially noticed in reporting trials.
Upon the trial of Gideon Henfield in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the District of Pennsylvania in 1793,
before Justices Wilson and Iredell and Judge Peters, for illegal privateering, Mr. Justice Wilson told the jury that "the
questions of law coming into joint consideration with the
facts, it is the duty of the court to explain the law to the jury
and give it to them in direction," and, after expressing the
unanimous opinion of the court upon the questions of law involved in the case, "concluded by remarking that the jury, in
a general verdict, must decide both law and fact, but that this
did not authorize them to decide it as they pleased, they were
as much bound to decide by law as the judges the responsibility was equal upon both." Wharton's State Trials, 49, 84,

81, 88.
This statement that the jury, in a general verdict, must de-cide both law and fact, and were as much bound to decide
by law as the judges, and under an equal responsibility, is
quite inconsistent with the idea that the jury were bound to
accept the explanation and direction of the court in matter of
law as controlling their judgment. That neither Mr. Justice
Wilson nor Mir. Justice Iredell entertained any such idea is
conclusively disproved by authentic and definite statements of
their views upon the question.
Mr. Justice Iredell, speaking for himself only, in a civil case
before this court at February term, 1795, said "It will not be
sufficient, that the court might charge the jury to find for the
defendant, because, though the jury will generally respect
the sentiments of the court on points of law, they are not
bound to deliver a verdict conformably to them." Bin gham

phia College in 1790 and 1791, discussing the maxim that the
judges determine the law and the jury determine the fact,
made the fbllowing observations
"This well known division between their provinces has been
long recogmized and established. When the question of law
and the question of fact can be decided separately, there is no
,doubt or difficulty in saying by whom the separate decision
shall be made. If, between the parties litigant, there is no
contention concerning the facts, but an issue is joined upon a
question of law, as is the case in a demurrer, the determination
of this question, and the trial of this issue, belongs exclusively
to the judges. On the other hand, when there is no question
,concerning the law, and the controversy between the parties
depends entirely upon a matter of fact, the determination of
this matter, brought to an issue, belongs exclusively to the
jury But, in many cases, the question cf law is intimately
and inseparably blended with the question of fact, and when
this is the case, the decision of one necessarily involves the
decision of the other. When this is the case, it is incumbent
on the judges to inform the jury concerning the law; and it is
incumbent on the jury to pay much regard to the information,
which they receive from the judges. But now the difficulty
in this interesting subject .begins to press upon us. Suppose
that, after all the precautions taken to avoid it, a difference of
sentiment takes place between the judges and the jury, with
regard to a point of law; suppose the law and the fact to be
so 6losely interwoven, that a determination of one must, at
the same time, embrace the determination of the other, suppose a matter of this description to come m trial before a jury
what must the jury do 2 The jury must do their duty and
their whole duty, they must decide the law as well as the
fact. This doctrine is peculiarly applicable to criminal cases,
and from them, indeed, derives its peculiar importance."
"Juries undoubtedly may make mistakes they may commit errors they may commit gross ones. But changed as
they constantly are, their errors and mistakes can never grow
into a dangerous system. The native uprightness of their sentiments will not be bent under the weight of precedent and

authority The esprit de corps will not be introduced amongthem, nor will society experience from them those mischiefs
of which the esprt de corps, unchecked, is sometimes productive. Besides, their mistakes and their errors, except the venial ones on the side of mercy made by traverse juries, are
not without redress. The court, if dissatisfied with their ver
dict, have the power, and will exercise the power, of granting
a new trial. This power, while it prevents or corrects the
effects of their errors, preserves the jurisdiction of juries
unimpaired. The cause is not evoked before a tribunal of
another kind, a jury of the country - an abstract, as it has
been called, of the citizens at large- summoned, selected, impanelled, and sworn as the former, must still decide."
"One thing, however, must not escape our attention. In
the cases and on the principles which we have mentioned,
jurors possess the power of determining legal questions. But
they must determine them according to law" 2 Wilson's
Works, 371-374.
In closing his discussion of the subject, and reviewing the
principles before stated, he said "With regard to the law in
criminal cases, every citizen, in a government such as ours,
should endeavor to acquire a reasonable knowledge of its principles and rules, for the direction of his conduct, when he is
called to obey, when he is called to answer, and when he is
called to judge. On questions of law, his deficiencies will be
supplied by the professional directions of the judges, whose
duty and whose business it is professionally to direct him.
For, as we have seen, verdicts, in criminal cases, generally
determine the question of law, as well as the question of fact.
Questions of fact, it is his exclusive province to determine.
With the consideration of evidence unconnected with the
question which he is to try, his attention will not be distracted, for everything of that nature, we presume, will be
excluded by the court. The collected powers of his mind,
therefore, will be fixed, steadily and without interruption
upon the issue which he is sworn to try This issue is an
issue of fact." 2 Wilson's Works, 386, 387.
These passages, taken together, clearly evince the view of

Mr. Justice Wilson to have been that, while an issue of law is
to be tried and decided by the judge, an issue of fact, although
it involve a question of law blended and interwoven with the
fact, is to be tried and decided by the jury, after receiving the
instructions of the court, and, if a difference of opinion arise
between them and the judge upon the question of law, it is
their right and their duty to decide the law as well as the
fact, that a reasonable knowledge of the principles and rules
of law is important to the citizen, not only "when he is called
to obey" as an individual, and "when he is called to answer"
as a defendant, but also "when he is called to judge" as a
juror, and that the general issue which the jury in a criminal
case are sworn to try, and which it is their duty to decide,
even if it involve questions of law, is "an issue of fact."
The provision of section 3 of the act of Congress of July
14, 1798, c. 74, for punishing seditious libels, that "the jury
who shall try the cause shall have a right to determine the
law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other
cases," (1 Stat. 597,) is a clear and express recognition of the
right of the jury in all criminal cases to determine the law
and the fact. The words "direction of the court," as here
used, like the words "opinion and directions" m the English
libel act, do not oblige the jury to adopt the opinion of the
court, but are merely equivalent to instruction, guide or aid,
and not to order, command or control. The provision is in
affirmance of the general rule, and not by way of creating an
exception, and the reason for inserting it probably was that
the right of the jury had been more often denied by the English courts in prosecutions for seditious libels than in any
other class of cases.
Upon the trial of John Fries for treason, in 1800, before
Mr. Justice Chase and Judge Peters, in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the District of Pennsylvama, the district attorney having quoted from English law books definitions of actual and constructive treason, Mr. Justice Chase
said "They may, any of them, be read to the jury, and the

bound, but as the opinions and decisions of men of great

attend carefully to the time of the decision, and in no case
must it be binding upon our juries." Trials of Fries, 180.
And he afterwards instructed the jury as follows "It is the
duty of the court in this case, and in all crmninal cases, to
state to the jury their opinion of the law arising on the facts,
but the jury are to decide, on the present and in all crznmnal
cases, both the law and the facts, on their consideration of the

whole case." And he concluded his charge in these words
"If, upon consideration of the whole matter, (law as well as
fact,) you are not fully satisfied, without any doubt, that the
prisoner is guilty of the treason charged in the indictment,
you will find him not guilty, but if upon the consideration
of the whole matter, (law as well as fact,) you are convinced
that the prisoner is guilty of the treason charged in the indictment, you will find him guilty" These instructions, with
words italicized as above, are in the exhibits annexed by Mr.
Justice Chase to his answer upon the impeachment in 1805.

In 1806, at the trial of William S. Smith m the Circuit

against a foreign country at peace with the United States,
Judge Talmadge said to the jury "You have heard much
said upon the right of a jury to judge of the law as well as
the fact." "The law is now settled that this right appertains
to a jury in all criminal cases. They unquestionably may
determine upon all the circumstances, if they will take the
responsibility and hazard of judging incorrectly upon questions of mere law But the jury is not therefore above the
law In exercising this right, they attach to themselves
the character of judges, and as such are as much bound by
the rules of legal decision as those who preside upon the

that you are the judges both of the law and fact in a criminal
case, and are not bound by the opinion of the court, you may
judge for yourselves, and if you should feel it your duty to
differ from us, you must find your verdict accordingly At the
same time, it is our duty to say, that it is in perfect accordance with the spirit of our legal institutions that courts
should decide questions of law, and the juries of facts, the
nature of the tribunals naturally leads to this division of
duties, and it is better, for the sake of public justice, that it
should be so when the law is settled by a court, there is
more certainty than when done by a jury, it will be better
known and more respected in public opinion. But if you are
prepared to say that the law is different from what you have
heard from us, you are in the exercise of a constitutional
right to do so. We have only one other remark to make on
this subject -by taking the law as given by the court, you
incur no moral responsibility, in making a rule of your own,
there may be some danger of a mistake." Baldwin, 78, 99,
100. And in Porter's case, the court, after repeating and
explaining these instructions, said to the jury, "In a word,
gentlemen, decide on the law and the facts as best comports
with your sense of duty to the public and yourselves, act on
the same rule under which you would be guided as a magistrate or judge on the oath and responsibility of office. Then
you will not err." Baldwin, 108, 109.
Some justices of this court, indeed, who, as already shown,
admitted the general right of juries in criminal cases to decide
both law and fact, denied their right to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute, apparently upon the ground that the
question of the existence or the validity of a statute was
for the court alone. Paterson, J., in Lyon's case, (1798)

Upon the general question of the right of the jury in criminal cases to decide the law, Chief Justice Marshall's opinion
is of so great weight, that the evidence of that opinion,
although perhaps not so satisfactory as might be wished,
should not be disregarded.
At the trial of Aaron Burr in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Yirgima in 1808, for treason
by levying war in Blennerhassett's Island, Chief Justice
Marshall, in delivering an opinion upon the order of evidence,
said "iLevying of war is a fact, which must be decided by
the jury The court may give general instructions on tins,
as on every other question brought before them, but the
jury must decide upon it as compounded of fact and law"
I Burr's Trial, 470.
In the charge, drawn up by the Chief Justice in writing,
and read by him to the jury, speaking of the question of the
defendant's constructive presence, he said "Had he not
arrived in the island, but had taken a position near enough
to co6perate with those on the island, to assist them in any
act of hostility, or to aid them if attacked, the question
whether he was constructively present would be a question
compounded of law and fact, which would be decided by the
jury, with the aid of the court, so far as respected the law"
2 Burr's Trial, 429.
The Chief Justice took occasion to demonstrate that questions of the admissibility of evidence must be decided by the
court only, saying "No person will contend that, in a civil
or criminal case, either party is at liberty to introduce what
testimony he pleases, legal or illegal, and to consume the
whole term in details of facts unconnected with the particular
case. Some tribunal, then, must decide on the admissibility
of testimony The parties cannot constitute this tribunal,
for they do not agree. The jury cannot constitute it, for the
question is whether they shall hear the testimony or not.
Who then but the court can constitute it 2 It is of necessity
the peculiar province of the court to judge of the admissibility
of testimony" p. 443.
Referring to his previous opinion on the order of testimony,

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion

he remarked "It was said that levying war is an act compounded of law and fact, of which the jury aided by the
court must judge. To that declaration the court still adheres." p. 444. And he concluded his charge thus "The
jury have now heard the opinion of the court on the law of
the case. They will apply that law to the facts, and will find
a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may
direct." p. 445.
It thus appears that Chief Justice Marshall, while affirming
that a question of the admissibility of evidence must be
decided by the court, because that question was whether the
jury should hear the evidence or not, yet told the jury, (in
many forms, but of the same meaning,) that upon a question
compounded of fact and law, involved in the issue submitted
to the jury, the court might give general instructions, but the
jury must decide it, that such a question, compounded of law
and fact, would be decided by the jury, with the aid of the
court so far as respects the law, that of such a question the
jury, aided by the court, must judge, and that, having
"heard the opinion of the court on the law of the case, they
will apply," not "that opinion," but "that law," namely, the
law as to which the court had expressed its opinion, "to the
facts, and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their
own consciences may direct." The manifest intent and effect
of all this was that the jury, after receiving the aid of the
instructions of the court on matter of law, must judge of
and determine, as their own consciences might direct, every
question compounded of law and fact, involved in the general
issue of guilty or not guilty
The meaning of the charge in this respect, as carefully prepared by the Chief Justice, is too clear to be controlled by
the words attributed to him by the reporter, on page 448, in
the course of a desultory conversation with counsel in regard
to other defendants, after the jury had found Burr not
guilty
In 1817, before Chief Justice Marshall, in the same court,

8, (1 Stat. 113, Rev Stat. § 5372,) enacting that any person
committing upon the high seas "murder or robbery, or any
other offence which, if committed within the body of a county,
would by the laws of the United States be punishable with
death," should be deemed a pirate. Mr. Upshur, for the defendant, argued "that it was necessary that robbery should
first be made punishable with death by the laws of the United
States, when committed on land, before it could amount to
piracy, when committed on the sea, which was not now the
case, that Judge Johnson had so decided in South Carolina,
although a contrary decision had been subsequently pronounced by Judge Washington, that the conflict between
these two learned judges proved that the law was at least
doubtful, that the jury in a capital case were judges, as well
of the law as the fact, and were bound to acquit, where
either was doubtful." Chief Justice Marshall, (far from denying this right of the jury,) "being appealed to for the interpretation of the law, decided that it was not necessary that
robbery should be punishable by death when committed on
land, in order to amount to piracy if committed on the ocean,
but as two judges (for both of whom the court entertained
the highest respect) had pronounced opposite decisions upon
it, the court could not undertake to say that it was not at least
doubtful." And the case being submitted to the jury, they
returned a verdict of not guilty

opinion upon the construction of the statute on which the
indictment was founded, conclude his charge to the jury by
telling them that, as it was a criminal case, they were not
bound to accept his opinion, but had the right to decide both
the law and the fact.
Until nearly forty years after the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, not a single decision of the highest
court of any State, or of any judge of a court of the United
States, has been found, denying the right of the jury upon the
general issue in a criminal case to decide, according to their
own judgment and consciences, the law involved in that issue
-except the two or three cases, above mentioned, concerning
the constitutionality of a statute. And it cannot have escaped
attention that many of the utterances, above quoted, maintaining the right of the jury, were by some of the most eminent and steadfast supporters of the Constitution of the United
States, and of the authority of the national judiciary
It must frankly be admitted that in more recent times,
beginning with the judgment of the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky in 1830 in 3lontee v Commonwealth, 3 J J Marsh.
132, and with Mr. Justice Story's charge to a jury in 1835 in
Unsted States v Battite,2 Sumner, 240, the general tendency
of decision in this country (as appears by the cases cited in
the opinion of the majority of the court) has been against the
right of the jury, as well in the courts of the several States,
including many States where the right was once established,
as in the Circuit Courts of the United States. The current
has been so strong, that in Massachusetts, where counsel are
admitted to have the right to argue the law to the jury, it
has yet been held that the jury have no right to decide it,
and it has also been held, by a majority of the court, that the
legislature could not constitutionally confer upon the jury the
right to determine, against the instructions of the court, questions of law involved in the general issue in criminal cases,
and in Georgia and in Louisiana, a general provision in the
constitution of the State, declaring that "in criminal cases
the jury shall be judges of -the law and fact," has been held
not to authorize them to decide the law against the instruc-

But, upon the question of the true meaning and effect of
the Constitution of the United States in this Tespect, opinions
expressed more than a generation after the adoption of the
Constitution have far less weight than the almost unanimous
voice of earlier and nearly contemporaneous judicial declarations and practical usage. Stuart v Lawrd, 1 Cranch, 299.
And, upon this constitutional question, neither decisions of
state courts, nor rulings of lower courts of the United States,
can relieve this court from the duty of exercising its own
judgment. Liverpool Steam Co. v Phenw Ins. Co., 129 U. S.
397, 443, Andrews v Hovey, 124 U. S. 694:, 717; The " .
.Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1, 17.
The principal grounds which have been assigned for denying the right of a jury, upon the general issue in a criminal
case, to determine the, law against the instructions of the
court, have been that the old maxim, ad qucestionemr jurs
,re.londentjudices, ad qucestonem faet-&esvondent yuratores,
is of universal application, that judges are more competent
than juries to determine questions of law, and thit decisions
upon such questions in one case become precedents to guide
the decision of subsequent cases.
But the question what are the rights, in this respect, of
persons accused of crime, and of juries summoned and empanelled to try them, under the Constitution of the United
States, is not a question to be decided according to what the
court may think would be the wisest and best system to be
established by the people or by the legislature, but what, in
the light of previous law, and of contemporaneous or early
construction of the Constitution, the people did affirm and
establish by that instrument.
This question, like all questions of constitutional construction, is largely a historical question,. and it is for that reason,
that it has seemed necessary, at the risk of tediousness, to
review and to state at some length the principal authorities
upon the subject in England and America. The reasons to be

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shiras, JJ.

derived from these authorities for maintaining the contested
right of the jury in this regard may be summed up as follows
By the Great Charter of England, and by the American
constitutions, it is not by a decision of the ablest or most
learned judges, that the citizen can be deprived of his life or
liberty, but it is only by "the judgment of his peers," or, in
the ancient phrase, "by his country," a jury taken from the
body of the .people.
The ancient forms, used before and since the adoption of
the Constitution, and hardly altered at the present day, in
which the general issue is pleaded by the accused, and submitted to the jury, are significant. When the defendant,
being arraigned upon the indictment, pleads not guilty, he is
asked by the clerk of the court, "How will you be tried "
and answers, "By God and my country" The oath administered to each juror as he is called and accepted is, "You shall
well and truly try and true deliverance make between our
sovereign lord the King" (or the State or People, or the
United States, as the case may be,) "and the prisoner at the
bar, whom you shall have in charge, according to your evidence. So help you God." And after the jury have been
empanelled, the clerk reads the indictment to the jury, and
then says to them "To this indictment the prisoner at the
bar has pleaded not guilty, and for trial has put himself upon
the country, which country you are. You are now sworn to
try the issue. If he is guilty, you will say so, if not guilty,
you will say so, and no more."
In the maxim, ad quceshonem jurzs r'espondent judices, ad
qucesttonem fach r&ondent yuratores, the word quwsto denotes an issue joined by the pleadings of the parties, or otherwise stated on the record, for decision by the appropriate
tribunal. Issues of law, so joined or stated, are to be decided
by the judge, issues of fact, by the jury If the accused
demurs to the indictment, an issue of law only is presented,
which must be decided and judgment rendered thereon by the
court, and by the court alone. But if the accused pleads generally not guilty, the only issue joined is an issue of fact, to be
decided by the jury, and by the jury only -unless the jury

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

171

Dissenting Opinion. Gray, Shiras, JJ.

choose to return a special verdict, so that the record may present an issue of mere law, to be decided by the court. After
a verdict of guilty, again, any defence in matter of law, apparent on the record, is to be considered and decided by the court
on motion in arrest of judgment.
The maxim has no application to rulings, in the course of
the trial, upon the admission of evidence. The object of rules
as to the competency of evidence is to prevent trials from being
unduly prolonged, and the consideration and decision of the
merits of the real issue on trial obscured, embarrassed or prejudiced by the introduction of irrelevant matter. The question
whether particular evidence shall be admitted or not is one to
be decided before the evidence can be submitted to the jury at
all, and must be, as it always is, decided by the court, and
this is so, whether the admissibility of the evidence depends,
as it usually does, upon a question of law only, or depends
largely or wholly upon a question of fact, as whether dying
declarations were made under immediate apprehension of
death, or whether a confession of the defendant was voluntary, or whether sufficient foundation has been laid for the
introduction of secondary evidence, or for permitting a witness to testify as an expert. To infer, because the court must
decide questions of law upon which the admissibility of evidence depends, that the jury have no right to determine the
matter of law involved in the general issue, would be as unwarrantable as to infer, because the court must decide questions of fact upon which the admissibility of evidence depends,
that the jury have no right to decide the matter of fact involved in that issue.
The jury to whom the case is submitted, upon the general
issue of guilty or not guilty, are entrusted with the decision
of both the law and the facts involved in that issue. To assist
them in the decision of the facts, they hear the testimony of
witnesses, but they are not bound to believe the testimony
To assist them in the decision of the law, they receive the
instructions of the judge, but they are not obliged to follow
his instructions.
Upon the facts, although the judge may state his view of

them, the duty of decision remains with the jury, and cannot
be thrown by them upon the judge. Upon the law involved
in the issue of fact, the jury, if they are satisfied to do so,
may let it be decided by the judge, either by returning a
general verdict in accordance with his opinion as expressed
to them, or by returning a special verdict reciting the facts
as found by them, and, by thus separating the law from the
facts, put the question of law in a shape to be decided by the
court in a more formal manner. But the whole issue, complicated of law and fact, being submitted to their determination,
the law does not require them to separate the law from the
fact, but authorizes them to decide both at once by a general
verdict.
The duty of the jury, indeed, like any other duty imposed
upon any officer or private person by the law of his country,
must be governed by the law, and not by wilfulness or caprice.
The jury must ascertain the law as well as they can. Usually
they will, and safely may, take it from the instructions of the
court. But if they are satisfied on their consciences that the
law is other than as laid down to them by the court, it is their
right and their duty to decide by the law as they know or
believe it to be.
In the forcible words of Chief Justice Vaughan, in Bushell's
case, Vaughan, 135, 148, already quoted "A man cannot see
by another's eye, nor hear by another's ear, no more can a
man conclude or infer the thing to be resolved by another's
understanding or reasoning, and though the verdict be right
the jury give, yet they, being not assured it is so from their
own understanding, are forsworn, at least -in foro con szentsce;" or, as more briefly stated in another report of the
same case, " The jury are perjured if the verdict be against
their own judgment, although by directions of the court, for
their oath binds them to their own judgment." T. Jones, 13, 17.
It is universally conceded that a verdict of acquittal, al
though rendered against the instructions of the judge, is final,
and cannot be set aside, and consequently that the jury have
the legal power to decide for themselves the law involved in
the general issue of guilty or not guilty

It has sometimes, however, been asserted that, although
they have the power, they have no right to do this, and that
it is their legal, or at least their moral duty, in every criminal
case, to obey and follow the judge's instructions in matter of
law The suggestion is not that the jury ought not to exercise
the power wrongfully, but that they ought not to exercise it
at all, that, whether the instructions of the court be right or
wrong, just or arbitrary, according to the law as known of all
men, or directly contrary to it, the jury must be controlled by
and follow them.
But a legal duty which cannot m any way, directly or
indirectly, be enforced, and a legal power, of which there can
never, under any circumstances, be a rightful and lawful
exercise, are anomalies - "the test of every legal power" (as
said by Alexander Hamilton, and affirmed by Chancellor
Kent, in People v Croswell, 3 Johns. Cas. 362, 368, above
cited) "being its capacity to produce a definite effect, liable
neither to punishment nor control"-" to censure nor review"
It has been said that, if not their legal duty, it is their
moral duty, to follow the instructions of the court in matter
of law But moral duties, as distinguished from legal duties,
are governed not by human, but by divine laws, and the
oath which the jurors m a capital case severally take to the
Almighty Judge is to well and truly try and true deliverance
make between the government and the. prisoner at the bar,
according to their evidence- not according to the instructions
of the court-and to decide whether, in their own judgment
and conscience, the accused is guilty or not guilty
The rules and principles of the criminal law are, for the most
part, elementary and simple, and easily understood by jurors
taken from the body of the people. As every citizen or subject is conclusively presumed to know the law, and cannot set
up his ignorance of it to excuse him from criminal responsibility for offending against it, a jury of his peers must be presumed to have equal knowledge, and, especially after being
aided by the explanation and exposition of the law by counsel
and court, to be capable of applying it to the facts as proved
by the evidence before them.

On the other hand, it is a matter of common observation,
that judges and lawyers, even the most upright, able and
learned, are sometimes too much influenced by technical rules,
and that those judges who are wholly or chiefly occupied in
the administration of criminal justice are apt, not only to grow
severe in their sentences, but to decide questions of law too
unfavorably to the accused.
The jury having the undoubted and uncontrollable power to
determine for themselves the law as well as the fact by a general verdict of acquittal, a denial by the court of their right to
exercise this power will be apt to excite in them a spirit of
jealousy and contradiction, and to prevent them from giving
due consideration and weight to the instructions of the court
in matter of law
In civil cases, doubtless, since the power to grant new trials
has become established, the court, being authorized to grant one
to either party as often as the verdict appears to be contrary
to the law, or to the evidence, may, in order to avoid unnecessary delay, whenever in its opinion the evidence will warrant
a verdict for one party only, order a verdict accordingly
v Lindsay, 93
Pleasants v Fant, 22 Wall. 116, HMendnem
U S. 143, Schofield v Chwago &c. Railway, 114 U S. 615.
But a person accused of crime has a twofold protection, in
the court and the jury, against being unlawfully convicted.
If the evidence appears to the court to be insufficient in law
to warrant a conviction, the court may direct an acquittal.
Smth v Undted States, 151 U S. 50. But the court can never
order the jury to convict, for no one can be found guilty, but
by the judgment of his peers.
Decisions of courts, and especially of courts of last resort,
upon issues of law, such as are presented by a demurrer or by a
special verdict, become precedents to govern judicial decisions
in like cases in the future. But the verdict of a jury, upon
the general issue of guilty or not guilty, settles nothing but the
guilt or innocence of the accused in the particular case, and the
issue decided is so complicated of law and fact, blended together,
that no distinct decision of any question of law is recorded or
made. The purpose of establishing trial by jury was not to

obtain general rules of law for future use, but to secure impar-

tial justice between the government and the accused in each
case as it arose.
As said by Alexander Hamilton in Croswell's case, above
cited, the power of deciding both law and fact upon the general issue in a criminal case is entrusted to the jury, "for reasons of a political and peculiar nature, for the security of life
and liberty" 7 Hamilton's Works, 335, 3 Johns. Cas. 362.
The people, by a jury drawn from among themselves, take
part in every conviction of a person accused of crime by the
government, and the general knowledge that no man can be
,otherwise convicted increases the public confidence in the justice of convictions, and is a strong bulwark of the administration of the criminal law
By the law of England, as has been seen, a person accused
of murder or other felony, and convicted before a single
judge, could not move for a new trial, and had no means of
reviewing his instructions to the jury upon any question of
law, unless the judge himself saw fit to reserve the question
for decision by higher judicial authority
Although Mr. Justice Story, in United States v Gibert,
(1831) 2 Sumner, 19, thought that a new trial could not be
granted to a man convicted of murder by a jury, because to
do so would be to put him twice in jeopardy of his life, yet
the Circuit Courts of the United States may doubtless grant
new trials after conviction, though not after acquittal, in
criminal cases tried before them. United States v Fr-les,
(1799) 3 Dall. 515, Unded States v Porter,(1830) Baldwin,
78, 108, Unted States v Harding, (1846) 1 Wall. Jr. 127,

wholly in the discretion of the court in which the trial was
had, and cannot be reviewed on error. Blitz v. United States,

only, as Congress may prescribe, and under the legislation of
Congress before 1889, no rulings or instructions of a Circuit
Court of the United States in a criminal case could be brought
to this court, unless upon a certificate of division of opinion
between two judges presiding at the trial. A person accused
of murder or other crime might be tried, and, if convicted by
the jury, sentenced before a single judge, perhaps only a district judge, and if so convicted and sentenced, there was no
way in which the judge's rulings could be reviewed by this
court. Act of April 29, 1802, c. 31, § 6, 2 Stat. 159, Rev.
Stat. §§ 651, 697, Untted States v More, 3 Cranch, 159, 172,

Black, 503, Ex _parte Yarbrough, 110 U S. 651, Unbted
States v Perrmn, 131 U S. 55.
By the acts of February 6, 1889, c. 113, § 6, and March 3,
1891, c. 517, indeed, a person convicted of murder or other
infamous crime in a Circuit Court of the United States may
bring the case to this court by writ of error, although the
United States cannot do so. 25 Stat. 656, 26 Stat. 827,
Unsted States v Sanges, 144 U. S. 310. But the right of review, so given to this court, cannot supersede or impair the
rightful power of the jury under the Constitution, in deciding
the issue submitted to them at the trial.
There may be less danger of prejudice or oppression from
judges appointed by the President elected by the people, than
from judges appointed by a hereditary monarch. But, as the
experience of history shows, it cannot be assumed that judges
will always be just and impartial, and free from the inclination, to which even the most upright and learned magistrates
have been known to yield -from the most patriotic motives,
and with the most honest intent to promote symmetry and
accuracy in the law- of amplifying their own jurisdiction
and powers at the expense of those entrusted by the Constitution to other bodies. And there is surely no reason why the
chief security of the liberty of the citizen, the judgment of his
peers, should be held less sacred in a republic than in a monarchy
Upon these considerations, we are of opinion that the
learned judge erred m instructing the jury that they were

SPARF AND HANSEN v. UNITED STATES.

177

Dissenting Opinion. Gray Shlras, JJ.

bound to accept the law as stated in his instructions, and that
tins error requires the verdict to be set aside as to both
defendants.
But we are also of opinion that the judge committed an
equally grave error in declining to submit to the jury matter
of fact involved m the issue on trial.
It clearly appears, that the jury were not only instructed
that, while they had the physical power to return a verdict
of manslaughter, yet they must take the law from the court,
but that they were also instructed that, if they found these
defendants guilty of any crime, it could not properly be manslaughter. There can be no doubt upon the record before us,
and it is admitted in the opinion of the majority of the court,
that the judge denied the right of the jury to find as a fact
that the defendants had been guilty of manslaughter only
Nor can there be any doubt that the jury were thereby led to
agree upon a verdict of guilty of murder, to the great prejudice of the defendants.
In a case in which the jury, as appeared by their inquiries
of the court, were in doubt whether the homicide committed
by the defendants was murder or manslaughter, to instruct
them that they could not acquit the defendants of murder
and convict them of manslaughter only, but must find them
guilty of murder or of no crime at all, does not appear to us to
differ, in principle, from instructing them, in a case m which
there was no question of manslaughter, that there was no
evidence upon which they could acquit the defendant, or do
anything but convict him of murder.
This is not a case in which the judge simply declined to
give any instructions upon a question of law which he thought
did not arise upon the evidence. But, after giving sufficient
definitions, both of murder and of manslaughter, he peremptorily told them that they could not convict the defendants of
manslaughter only, and thereby denied the right of the jury
to pass upon a matter of fact necessarily included in the issue
presented by the general plea of not guilty
This appears to us to be inconsistent with settled principles
of law, and with well considered authorities.

As said by this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Clifford,
"In criminal cases, the true rule is that the burden of proof
never shifts, that in all cases, before a conviction can be had,
the jury must be satisfied from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the affirmative of the issue presented in the
accusation that the defendant Is guilty in the manner and
form as charged in the indictment." Lilienthal's tobacco v.
Unqzted States, 97 U S. 237, 266. See also Potter v United
States, 155 U S. 438, Commonwealth v HMoRie, 1 Gray, 61,
People v -Downs, 123 N. Y 558.
Upon the trial of an indictment under a statute of the Territory of Utah, establishing two degrees of murder, with
different punishments, the jury were instructed, "that an
atrocious and dastardly murder has been committed by some
person is apparent, but in your deliberations you should be
careful not to be influenced by any feeling," and the defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to death. This court, upon writ of error to the
Supreme Court of the Territory, reversed the judgment, because that instruction must have been regarded by the jury
as "an instruction that the offence, by whomsoever committed, was murder in the first degree, whereas it was for
the jury, having been informed as to what was murder, by
the laws of Utah, to say whether the facts made a case of
murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree;"
and "the prisoner had the right to the judgment of the jury
upon the facts, uninfluenced by any direction from the court
as to the weight of the evidence." iopt v Utah, 110 U S.
574, 582, 583.
As stated by the Chief Justice, speaking for this court, in a
case of murder, decided at the last term, "It is true that in
the Federal courts the rule that obtains is similar to that in
the English courts, and the presiding judge may, if in his discretion he think proper, sum up the facts to the jury, and if
no rule of law is incorrectly stated, and the matters of fact
are ultimately submitted to the determination of the jury, it
has been held that an expression of opinion upon the facts is
not reviewable on error. Rucker v T-heeler, 127 U S. 85,

should take care to separate the law from the facts, and to
leave the latter in unequivocal terms to the judgment of the
jury as their true and peculiar province. X'Lanahan v Urs_
versal Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 170, 182. As the jurors are the triers of
facts, expressions of opinion by the court should be so guarded

The Supreme Court of Michigan, speaking by Chief Justice
Cooley, in setting aside a verdict of murder, in a case in which
the homicide was admitted, and the only question was whether
it was murder or manslaughter, said "The trial of criminal
cases is by a jury of the country, and not by the court. The
jurors, and they alone, are to judge of the facts, and weigh
the evidence. The law has established this tribunal, because
it is believed that, from its numbers, tlhe mode of their selection, and the fact that the jurors come from all classes of
society, they are better calculated to judge of motives, weigh
probabilities, and take what may be called a common sense
view of a set of circumstances, involving both act and intent,
than any single man, however pure, wise and eminent he may
be. This is the theory of the law, and, as applied to criminal
accusations, it is eminently wise, and favorable alike to liberty
and to justice. But to give it full effect, the jury must be left
to weigh the evidence, and to examine the alleged motives by
their own tests. They cannot properly be furnished for this
purpose with balances which leave them no discretion, but
which, under certain circumstances, will compel them to find
a malicious intent when they cannot conscientiously say they
believe such an intent to exist." Peopfe v Gabutt, 17 Michigan, 9, 27.
In The Zing v Burdett, cited in the earlier part of this
opinion, Mr. Justice Best said "If there was any evidence,
it was my duty to leave it to the jury, who alone could judge
of its weight. The rule that governs a judge as to evidence
applies equally to the case offered on the part of the defendant, and that in support of the prosecution. It will hardly be
contended, that if there was evidence offered on the part of

the defendant, a judge would have a right to take on himself
to decide on the effect of the evidence, and to withdraw it
from the jury Were a judge so to act, he might, with great
justice, be charged with usurping the privileges of the jury,
and making a criminal trial, not what it is by our law, a trial
by jury, but a trial by the judge." And Lord Tenterden, in
words peculiarly applicable to the present case, said "In
cases of murder, it rarely happens that the eye of any witness
sees the fatal blow struck, or the poisonous ingredients poured
into the cup. In drawing an inference or conclusion from
facts proved, regard must always be had to the nature of the
particular case, and the facility that appears to be afforded,
either of explanation or contradiction." "The premises may
lead more or less strongly to the conclusion, and care must be
taken not to draw the conclusion hastily, but in matters that
regard the conduct of men, the certainty of mathematical
demonstration cannot be required or expected, and it is one
of the peculiar advantages of our jurisprudence, that the conclusion is to be drawn by the unanimous judgment and conscience of twelve men, conversant with the affairs and business
of life, and who know, that where reasonable doubt is entertained, it is their duty to acquit, and not of one or more
lawyers, whose habits might be suspected of leading them
to the indulgence of too much subtilty and refinement."
4 3. & Ald. 95, 121, 161, 162.
The care with which courts of the highest authority have
guarded the exclusive right of the jury to decide the facts in
a criminal case is exemplified in a very recent case before the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in which, under section 423 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1883, (46 Vict.
c. 17,) authorizing the judge presiding at a criminal trial to
reserve questions of law for review, with a proviso that no
judgment should be reversed "unless for some substantial
wrong or other miscarriage of justice," the questions reserved
were whether certain evidence had been improperly admitted,
and whether, if the court came to the conclusion that it was
not legally admissible, the court could nevertheless affirm the
judgment if it was of opinion that, independently of that evi-

dence, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction,
and that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he
was charged. It was argued that if, without the inadmissible
evidence, there was evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict
and to show that the accused was guilty, there had been no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in affirming a judgment upon the conviction by the jury But LordoChancellor
Herschell, speaking for six other law lords as well as for himself, held otherwise, and said "It is obvious that the construction contended for transfers from the jury to the court
the determination of the question whether the evidence -that
is to say, what the law regards as evidence -establishes the
guilt of the accused. The result is that in a case where the
accused has the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a
jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not on
the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the court. The
judges are in truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal
of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the
assistance which this affords. It is impossible to deny that
such a change of the law would be a very serious one, and
that the construction which their lordships are invited to put
upon the enactment would gravely affect the much cherished
right of trial by jury in criminal cases." .Afakm v Attorney
General, (1894) App. Cas. 57, 69, 70.
By section 1035 of the Revised Statutes, "Im all criminal
causes, the defendant may be found guilty of any offence the
commission of which is necessarily included in that with which
he is charged in the indictment, or may be found guilty of an
attempt to commit the offence so charged Provided, that
such attempt shall be itself a separate offence." The defendants, therefore, under this indictment, might have been convicted of murder, or of manslaughter, or of an assault only

burden of proof at every step was upon the government. In
order to obtain a conviction of murder, it must prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that the homicide was committed with
malice. The question whether, taking into consideration all
the circumstances in evidence, as well as the credibility of the
several witnesses, there was a criminal homicide, and, if so,
whether it was murder or only manslaughter, could be finally
decided against the defendants by the jury alone. According
to the settled practice of the courts of the United States, indeed, the court, even in a criminal case, may express its opinion to the jury upon any question of fact, provided that it
submits that question to the jury for decision. But the court
in this case went beyond this, and distinctly told the jury that,
if they found that a felonious homicide had been committed
by the defendants, they could not properly convict them of
manslaughter, which was equivalent to saying that, if any
crime was proved, it was murder. This instruction had the
direct tendency, and the actual effect, of inducing the jury to
return a verdict of guilty of the higher crime. The jury may
have been satisfied that the defendants killed the mate without lawful excuse, and may yet have had doubts whether, upon
so much of the testimony as they believed to be true, the killing was malicious and therefore murder. That doubts had
occurred to the jurors upon this point is shown by the questions addressed by one of them to the presiding judge. The
judge dispelled those doubts, not by further defining the distinction as matter of law between murder and manslaughter,
but by telling the jury that as matter of fact they could not
convict the defendants of manslaughter only He thus substituted his own decision upon this question of fact for the
decision of the jury, to which the defendants were entitled
under the Constitution and laws. of the United States. If all
the justices of this court should concur in the opinion of the
judge below upon this question of fact, still the defendants
have not had the question decided by the only tribunal competent to do so under the Constitution and laws.
For the twofold reason that the defendants, by the instructions given by the court to the jury, have been deprived, both

Applications to this court for a writ of error to a state court are not entertamed unless at the request of a member of the court, concurred in by
his associates.
The decision of the highest court of a State that it was competent under an
indictment for murder simply, to try and convict a person of murder in
the first degree if the homicide was perpetrated in the commission of
or attempt to commit robbery, presents no Federal question for consideration.
When the record in a case brought here from the lghest court of a State
by writ of error discloses no Federal question as decided by that court,
there is nothing in the case for this court to consider.

WILLIAM ROBERTSON was convicted of murder in the first
degree, at the December term, 1892, of the county court of
Franklin County, Virginia, and sentenced to be hanged February 3, 1893. A petition for writ of error was denied by the
Circuit Court of Franklin County, but the writ was subsequently allowed by one of the judges of the Supreme Court
