HARTIGAN v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 72. Submitted December 6, 1904.-Decided January 3,1905.
A cadet at the West Point Military Academy is not an officer of the United
States Army within the meaning of §§ 1229, 1342, Rev. Stat., and, if
delinquent, may be dismissed by the President without trial and conviction by court-martial.

filed a petition m the Court of Claims to have
declared void his dismissal from the United States Military
Academy at West Point, and for judgment for his pay as a
cadet from July 27, 1883, to July 1, 1889, amounting to $3,417
The appellant was duly appointed a cadet in the Military
Academy on the first day of July, 1880, and served as such until
the twenty-seventh of July, 1883, when he was summarily dismissed, by order of the President, upon charges of maltreating
a new cadet upon guard, as well as other improper conduct.
After the dismissal of appellant another cadet was appointed
to succeed him, was duly graduated from the Academy, and
appointed and commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army,
and subsequently a captain of the Twenty-fifth Regiment of
Infantry
The appellant, subsequently to his dismissal, presented petitions respectively to the Adjutant General of the Army and to
the Secretary of War, in which he asserted his innocence of the
charges made against him, and prayed for reinstatement or
trial by court-martial. He also presented a petition April 21,
1888, to the President, asking for a revocation of the order of
dismissal, a trial by court-martial, and for an order assigning
and appointing him to the Army as of the date of the assignment of the last graduate of his class. The petitions were all
denied.
The Court of Claims held that he was not entitled to recover,
and dismissed his petition. 38 C. Cl. 346.

Mr L. T Michener and Mr W W Dudley for appellant:
Appellant was an officer in the sense of §2, Art. 2, of the
Constitution. He was appointed pursuant to § 1315, Rev
Stat., and took the oath presented by § 1320. Cadets are subject to perform duty, § 1323, to courts-martial, § 1326, and
receive a salary, § 1339. Their service is actual service in the

Opinion of the Court.

Rev Stat., Babbitt v United States, 16 C.Cl. 204, S. C., affirmed
104 U S. 767, 1 Op. Atty Geni's, 276, 290; compare provisions
in Rev Stat. §§ 1116-1119 for enlistment of private soldiers;
United States v Watson, 130 U S. 82. The claimant by his
contract with the Government bound himself to obey the
Articles of War, which were enacted under § 1342 Rev Stat.
Under Arts. of War, 4 and 99, officer means commissioned
officer.
The status of naval cadets differs from that of military cadets.

MR. JusTIcE McKEiNA, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The contention of appellant is that, as a cadet, he was an
officer in the Army, within the meaning of section 1229 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, and could only have
been dismissed from the Academy upon trial and conviction
by court-martial, as provided in that section.
That section provides as follows.: "The President is authorized to drop from the rolls of the Army for desertion any
officer who is absent from duty three months without leave,
and no officer so dropped shall be eligible for reappointment.
And no officer in the military or naval service shall in time of
peace be dismissed from service except upon and in pursuance
of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof."
In the Articles of War, enacted by section 1342 of the
Revised Statutes, the word "commutation" is changed to
"mitigation." Art. 99.
The first impression of claimant's contention is that it
ignores obvious distinctions, and makes a state of preparation
for a position the same as the position itself, and claims its

sanction for one who is not bearing its responsibilities or
capable of discharging its duties. And an examination of
the Revised Statutes' Ikting to the organization of the Army
confirms the impressi6i.
Manifestly, it is impossible to reproduce all the sections of
the Revised Statutes applicable to the military establishment,
and we will only observe that they distinguish between the
Army prbper and the Military Academy, and make a distinction between an officer and a cadet. A few citations only are
necessary
Title XIV of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides for the organization of the Army of the United States.
The name, rank and function of each officer is provided for,
and section 1213 explicitly states when a cadet shall become
an officer. That section enacts that when a cadet shall have
regularly graduated from the Academy he "shall be considered
a candidate for a commission in any corps for whose duties he
may be deemed competent." He then becomes a commissioned officer. Prior to that time he is denominated a cadet,
appointed as a cadet, and provision made for him under that
name and state. He becomes an officer when he ceases to be
a cadet, that is, when he has finished his pupilage; or, as section 1213 expresses it, when "he has gone through all his
classes and received a regular degree from the academic staff"
and commissioned. And his government while a cadet is
provided for in chapter 5 of title XIV
A cadet may be in the Army (section 1094), may be an
officer in a certain sense as distinguished from an enlisted man,
as it is contended by counsel for the Government he is, but
nevertheless section 1229 does not apply to him. That section
is one of a number of provisions for the organization and government of the Army, distinct from and having no relation
whatever to the provisions for the government of the Military
Academy and the cadets. Section 1229 is made part of, and
the word "officer" given exact definition by section 1342,
which provides as follows:

HARTIGAN v. UNITED STATES.
196 U. S.

Opnon of the Court.

"SEC. 1342. The armies of the United States shall be governed by the following rules and articles: The word officer, as
used therein, shall be understood to designate commissioned
officers; the word soldier shall be understood to include noncommissioned officers, musicians, artificers, and privates, and
other enlisted men, and the convictions mentioned therein
shall be understood to be convictions by court-martial."
By article 99 it is enacted.
"No officer shall be discharged or dismissed from the service, except by order of the President, or by sentence of a general court-martial, and in time of peace no officer shall be dismissed, except in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial,
or in mitigation thereof."
It is only a commissioned officer, therefore, who is entitled
to the protection of a general court-martial, and a cadet is not
a commissioned officer.
The argument of appellant, contending against this construction of the statute, is not easy to reproduce or make clear,
and it involves the anomaly that there can be an officer in the
Army of the United States who is not covered by the Articles
of War, notwithstanding the declaration of section 1342, that
the Armies of the United States shall be governed by those
articles.
The object of the argument is to make independent section 1229 of section 1342, and to give a cadet the protection
expressed by the former, on the ground that a cadet is an
officer, but not a commissioned officer. That a cadet is an
officer is deduced from the fact that he is appointed by the
President, takes an oath to obey his "superior officers," and
receives pay But, as we have already intimated, it is not
necessary to dispute that a cadet is an officer. Whether he is
or not is not the question in the case. The question is, whether
section 1229 applies to him, and to so construe it would seemingly give it no application except to cbdets (and officers in the
naval service), and transfer it from the government of the
Army to the government of the Academy; and, we may ob-

serve, would render the distinction implied by it between a
time of peace and a time of war almost meaningless. It is
nevertheless contended by appellant that section 1229 is unaffected by section 1342 and the Articles of War, but is a part
of section 1326, which gives the Superintendent of the Academy
the power to convene general courts-martial for the trial of
cadets. In other words, the contention is that section 1326 is
not merely a grant of power to the Superintendent of the
Academy to convene courts-martial for the trial of cadets, but
commands him to do so. And it would seem necessarily for
every infraction of discipline. What, it may be asked, under
the contention of appellant, is the relation between section 1326
and section 1325? By the latter section there can be deficiency
in studies as well as conduct. Can there be no discharge from
the Academy for deficiency in studies except upon and in
pursuance of a court-martial to that effect?
The cases cited by appellant do not conflict with these views.
United States v Morton, 112 U S. 1, decides only that the time
of service as a cadet was actual time of service in the Army
within the meaning of the statutes giving longevity pay to
officers. In United States v Baker, 125 U. S. 646, and United
States v Cook, 128 U S. 254, statutes giving longevity pay to
officers in the Navy were construed, and it was held that a cadet
midshipman was an officer of the Navy The reasoning of the
court, however, has no application to the construction of sections 1229 and 1342.
The power of the President to dismiss a delinquent cadet
we do not understand is questioned, except as that power is
affected by sections 1229 and 1342. We may, however, refer
to Matter of Hennen, 13 Pet. 230; Blake v United States, 103
U S. 227, 236, Mullan v United States, 140 U S. 240; Parsons
v United States, 167 U S. 324, Shurtleff v United States, 189
U S. 311.
Judgment a/firmed.
