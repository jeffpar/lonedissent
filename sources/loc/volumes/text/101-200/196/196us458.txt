ALLEN v. ALLEGHANY COMPANY
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 119. Argued January 11, 1905.-Decided February 20, 1905.

The mere construction by a state court of a statute of another State and its
operation elsewhere, without questioning its validity, does not necessarily
involve a Federal question, or deny to the statute the full faith and
credit demanded by ยง 709, Rev. Stat., in order to give this court Jursdiction to review.
The statutes of New York and Pennsylvania prohibit foreign corporations
from doing business in those States respectively unless certain specified
conditions are complied with. In an action in New Jersey the state court
held that contracts made in New York and Pennsylvania by a corporation which had not complied with the statutes of either State were not
spso facto void and might be enforced in New Jersey. On writ of error
Held: that
The writ must be dismissed as the validity of the New York and Pennsylvama statutes was not denied but the case turned only upon their construction and the effect to be given them in another State.
Whether, aside from a Federal question, the courts of one State should have
sustained the action upon principles of comity between the States is a
matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state court.

THs was a suit begun m the Supreme Court of New Jersey
by the Alleghany Company, to recover the amount due upon
a promissory note dated at New York, July 16, 1900, given
by the plaintiffs in error, under the firm name of I. N. E. Allen
& Co., for $1,989.54, upon which payments amounting to
$1,000 were endorsed. The declaration was upon the common counts, but annexed was a copy of the note, with a notice
that the action was brought to recover the amount due thereon.
The defendants pleaded four several pleas:
1. General issue.
2. That the note was executed and delivered in the State
of New York to the plaintiff company, a business corporation
created under the laws of North Carolina. That when said
note was executed and delivered it was provided by the statute
of the State of New York that:

any action in this State, upon any contract made by it in this

The plea further averred that at the time of the making of
the note the plaintiff was a business stock corporation, foreign
to the State of New York, and had not theretofore procured
from the Secretary of State a certificate that it had complied
with all the requirements of the law to authorize it- to do
business within the State, and that the business of said plaintiff was such as might be lawfully carried on by a corporation
incorporated under the laws of said State for such or similar
business, according to the form of the statute of New York
in such case made and provided.
3. The third plea sets out that the note was made and
executed in the State of Pennsylvania to the plaintiff company, a foreign corporation created under the laws of North
Carolina.
That when said note was executed and delivered it was
provided by the State of Pennsylvania that"1. No foreign corporation shall do any business in this
Commonwealth until said corporation shall have established
an office or offices and appointed an agent or agents for the
transaction of its business therein. 2. It shall not be lawful
for any such corporation to do any business m this Commonwealth, until it shall have filed in the office of the Secretary
of the Commonwealth a statement under the seal of said corporafion, and signed by the president or secretary thereof;
showing the title and. object of said corporation, the location
of its office or offices, and the name or names of its authorized

agent or agents therein, and the certificate of the Secretary
of the Commonwealth, under the seal of the Commonwealth,
of the filing of such statement shall be preserved for public
inspection by each of said agents m each and every of said
offices. 3. Any person or persons, agents, officers or employ~s of any such foreign corporation, who shall transact
any business within this Commonwealth for any such foreign
corporation, without the provisions of this act being complied
with, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
thereof shall be punished by imprisonment, not exceeding
thirty days, and by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars,
or either, at the discretion of the court trying the same."
The plea further averred that at the making of the note
the plaintiff was a corporation foreign to the said Commonwealth, and had not theretofore filed m the office of the Secretary a statement showing the title and object of said plaintiff,
the location of its office, and the name of its authorized agent
therein, according to the form of said statute, yet notwithstanding the premises, the plaintiff at the time of the making
of the said note did business m the said Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, contrary to the form of the said statute.
The plaintiff demurred to the second and third pleas, and
the demurrer being overruled, the cause was sent down to the
Circuit Court of Hudson County for trial on an issue of fact
raised by the fourth plea, which is not material here.
The trial judge there directed a verdict for the plaintiff,
and upon appeal to the Court of Errors and Appeals of New
Jersey the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. 69

Mr James A. Gordon for defendant in errorThis court has no jurisdiction. Full faith and credit were
given by the New Jersey court to the statutes of the States
of New York and Pennsylvania. The case turned upon the
construction of these statutes. Their validity was not called
in question. Johnson v N Y Life Ins. Co., 187 U S. 491,
Bauholzer v N Y Life Ins. Co., 178 U S. 402, Lloyd v Matthews, 155 U S. 222, Glen v Garth, 147 U S. 360.

Under the New York statute, a contract made in New York
by a foreign corporation, not complying with the provisions
of the act, cannot be enforced in that State, but the statute
does not make the contract void, or prevent its enforcement
in any other court.

The New Jersey court fully considered this statute and construed it after referring to the decisions of the New York
Court of Appeals and other decisions which seemed in point,
and which are cited in the opinion of the Court of Errors.
See cases -cited in the opinion and Fritz v Palmer, 132
U S. 282. Whether the state court construed the statute
correctly is not subject to review in this court.
The third plea, which sets up the Pennsylvania statutes,
fails to allege that the note upon which this suit is founded
had any connection with business unlawfully transacted in
Pennsylvania, within the meaning of the statute, and for this
reason the New Jersey court sustained the demurrer to this plea.
The Court of Errors gave the Pennsylvania statute the same
construction given to it by the Pennsylvania courts, but decided that the plea did not contain sufficient allegations of
fact to bring the note in suit, within the prohibition of the
statute.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opnon of the Court.

196 U. S.

The decision of the New Jersey court was correct, but on
this question of pleading, the decision of the state court is not
reviewable m this court.
The statutes pleaded have no extra territorial effect, except
upon principles of comity; and the plaintiffs in error, on the
argument before the New Jersey Supreme Court, having disclaimed that the principles of comity were involved in the
case, cannot now rely upon them.
MR. JusTIcE, BROWN, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The defendants, plaintiffs in error here, pleaded that the
note upon which suit was brought was executed in the State
of New York, and that under the laws of that State no foreign
corporation could do business there without a certificate of
the Secretary of State that it had complied with all the requirements of law to authorize it to do business there; and
that no such corporation could maintain any action in that
State unless, prior to the making of such contract, it had
procured such certificate, that plaintiff was a foreign corporation within the meaning of the law, and had not procured
a certificate.
The third plea was similar in terms, averring the note to
have been made in Pennsylvania, whose statutes provided
that foreign corporations should do no business in the State
without filing a certain statement in the Secretary's office and
procuring the certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth,
and further providing that the agent of any foreign corporation transacting business within the State, without complying
with the provisions of the law, should be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor. The plea also averred non-compliance with
those provisions.
Both the Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals held that a contract made in contravention of these
statutory regulations, though not enforcible in the courts of

ALLEN v. ALLEGHANY COMPANY.
196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

New York and Pennsylvania, was not ipso facto void, and
might be, notwithstanding such statutes, enforced in New
Jersey
Plaintiffs in error insist that by this ruling full faith and
credit was denied by the courts of New Jersey to the statutes
of New York and Pennsylvania, in contravention to section 1,
Article IV, of the Constitution.
By section 709 of the Revised Statutes, authorizing writs
of error to the state courts, it is declared that final judgments,
where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any
State, or any authority exercised under any State, on the
ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, etc., and
the decision is in favor of their validity, may be reexamined
here.
But the validity of these statutes was not denied. The case
turned upon their construction and the effect to be given to
them m another State. The New York statute directly, and
the Pennsylvania indirectly, forbade the maintenance of actions "in this State." The Pennsylvania statute made it a
misdemeanor to transact business without complying with
the law Neither statute declared the contract so made to be
void, and it was apparently upon this ground that the New
Jersey courts held that the case did not fall within those decisions, wherein it is declared that a contract void by the lex
loci contractus is void everywhere.
In several cases we have held that the construction of a
statute of another State and its operation elsewhere did not
necessarily involve a Federal question. The case is practically
governed by that of the Chwago & Alton R. R. v Wigg.ns
Ferry Co., 119 U. S. 615. In that case suit was brought in a
state court by the ferry company against the railroad to
recover damages for not employing the ferry company for
the transportation of persons and property across the river,
as by its contract it was bound to do. The defendant pleaded
that it had no power to make the contract; that the same was
in violation of the laws of Illinois, contrary to the public policy

thereof and was void. The statutes were put m evidence,
but their construction and operative effect were disputed.
The Supreme Court of the State held that the contract was
interpreted correctly by the court below, and that it was not
ultra wnres, contrary to public policy, or m restraint of trade.
It was argued here by the railroad company that by law and
usage of Illinois, the charter of the company m that State
made the contract ultra vnres. We held that the law of Illinois
to that effect should have been proved as a fact, either by
decisions of its courts or by law or usage in that State, that
state courts are not charged with a knowledge of the laws of
another State, but they have to be proved, and that while
Federal courts exercising their original jurisdiction are bound
to take notice of the laws of the several States, yet this court,
when exercising its appellate jurisdiction from state courts,
whatever was the matter of fact m that court is matter of fact
here, citing Hanley v Donoghue, 116 U S. 1. We said.
"Whether the charter of this company, in its operation on
the contract now in suit, had any different effect in Illinois
from what it would have, according to the principles of general
law which govern like charters and like contracts, m Missouri
and elsewhere throughout the country, was, under this rule,
a question of fact m the Missouri court, as to which no testimony whatever was offered."
No proof having been offered to support the averment that
the contract was in violation of the laws of Illinois, the defense
relying on the general claim that the contract was illegal, it
was held that no Federal question was involved, and the case
was dismissed. It was said that it should have appeared on
the face of the record that the facts presented for adjudication
made it necessary for the court to consider the act of incorporation in view of the peculiar jurisprudence in Illinois, rather
than the general law of the land.
Since the above case we have repeatedly held that the mere
construction by a state court of a statute of another State
without questioning its validity, does not, with possibly some

exceptions, deny to it the full faith and credit demanded by
the statute in order to give this court jurisdiction. Glenn v
Garth, 147 U S. 360; Lloyd v Matthews, 155 U S. 222; Banholzer v New York Life Insurance Co., 178 U S. 402; Johnson
v New York Life Ins. Co., 187 U S. 491, Finney v Guy, 189
U. S. 335.
The Court of Errors and Appeals, conceding the general
rule both in New Jersey and New York to be that a contract,
void by the law of the State where made, will not be enforced
in the State of the forum. ColumbIa Fire Insurance Co. v
Kenyon, 37 N. J Law 33 and Hyde v Goodnow, 3 N. Y 266
held that the state statute of New York did not declare the
contract void, and that there was no decision in that State
holding it to be so. In fact the only case in the Court of Appeals in New York, Neuchatel Asphalte Co. v Mayor, 155
N. Y 373, is the other way The Court of Appeals in that
case held that the purpose of the act was not to avoid contracts, but to provide effective supervision and control of the
business carried on by foreign corporations; that no penalty
for non-compliance was provided, except the suspension of
civil remedies in that State, and none others would be implied.
This corresponds with our rulings upon similar questions.
Frilts v Palmer, 132 U S. 282.
With respect to the Pennsylvania statute, the court held
that, although the Pennsylvania courts had held that a contract made in violation of the Pennsylvania statute was void,
yet that the third plea did not contain allegations which
showed that the note was given in pursuance of business
carried on in Pennsylvania, and not in consummation of a
single transaction, and although it was averred that plaintiff
did business in that State, it was not averred that the note
had any connection with the business carried on in Pennsylvania, or that it was given for goods sold in Pennsylvania.
The admitted averments may be true, and yet the note may
have been given for an obligation contracted out of the State
of Pennsylvania, and consequently, not in violation of its laws.

Construing the third plea most strongly against the pleader,
the conclusion was that it disclosed no defense in the action.
This was purely a local question, and is not assignable as error
here.
Whether, aside from the Federal question discussed, the
courts of New Jersey should have sustained this action upon
principles of comity between the States, was also a question
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state court. Finney

CORRY v. THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND.
No. 86. Argued December 8, 1904.-Decided February 20, 1905.
The sovereign that creates a corporation has the incidental right to impose
reasonable regulations concerning the ownership of stock therein and it
is not an unreasonable regulation to establish the situs of stock for purposes of taxation, at the principal office of the corporation whether owned
by residents or non-residents, and to compel the corporation to pay the
tax for the stockholders giving it a right of recovery therefor against the

stockholders and a lien on the stock.
Where valid according to the laws of the State such a regulation does not
deprive the stockholder of his property without due process of law either
because it is an exercise of the taxing power of the State over persons
and things not within its jurisdiction, or because notice of the assessment is not given to each stockholder, provided notice is given to the
corporation and the statute either m terms, or as construed by the state
court, constitutes the corporation the agent of the stockholders to receive
notice and to represent them m proceedings for the correction of the assessment.
While the liability of non-resident stockholders for taxes on his stock may
not be expressed in the charter of the company if it existed m the general
laws of the State at the time of the creation of the corporation or the
extension of its charter, and the constitution of the State also contained
at such times the reserved right to alter, amend and repeal, those provisions of the constitution and general laws of the State are as much A
part of the charter as if expressly embodied therein,
