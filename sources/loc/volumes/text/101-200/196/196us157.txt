the contention of plaintiff in error, but cannot be followed
against the authority and reasoning of the other cases.
2. The second contention of plaintiff in error is that it was
the duty of the District of Columbia to so light the street as
to show the presence of the stone thereon, the District having
full knowledge thereof. This duty is made to rest mainly
upon section 233 of the Revised Statutes of the District of
Columbia, which is as follows:
"The proper authorities are directed to increase, from time
to time as the public good may require, the number of street
lamps on any of the streets, lanes, alleys, public ways and
grounds in the city of Washington, and to do any and all
things pertaing to the well lighting of the city"
This, in one sense, is but another form of the first contention. The duty of a city to especially illuminate a place where
an object is, or to put a policeman on guard by it to warn
pedestrians, depends upon the object being an unlawful obstruction.
The plaintiff in error can claim nothing from the general
duty of the city under the statute to light the streets. The
exercise of such duty was necessarily a matter of judgment
and discretion, depending upon considerations which this record does not exhibit.
Judgment affirmed.

Francisco, and that the United States, in the absence of any provision to
the contrary, could not be held liable for the demurrage paid by the
shipper to the owners of vessels carrying the coal for delay in discharging their cargoes on account of the crowded condition of the harbor.
In engagements to furnish goods to a certain amount the quantity specified
governs. Words like "about" and "more or less" are only for the purpose of providing against accidental and not material variations.
Under the contract in this case for delivery of "about" 5,000 tons of coal
the United States cannot refuse to accept more than 4,634 tons, but is
liable for the difference in value on 366 tons tendered and acceptance
refused.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Where the consignee is not bound by the contract to furnish
a berth (and the consignee in this case certaily was not), and
where the vessel is required to take its turn in unloading (the
vessels in this case certainly were), he is not liable for delay
caused by an extraordinary accumulation of vessels to be unloaded. Such is the principle to be gleaned from the authorities heretofore cited. Reasonableness is all that is required
of the consignee with reference to the receipt and disposal of a
cargo m all shipping contracts, and as we have before stated,
where the charter party or the-bill of lading is silent as to the
matters in dispute here, reasonable conduct only is required.

Law, 2d ed., 255, Carver's Carriage by Sea, § 736, 7 Comp.
Dec. 573, 2 Parsons, 423.
No particular wharf was designated, but it was specifically
and definitely stated in the contract that the coal should be
delivered at a wharf in the port of Honolulu and the facts
found show that only one of three places at said port would
conform to this requirement. To one of these places the ships
in question must come before "lay days" would commence
to run, and the United States as consignee was not liable for
delays to the ships m coming to such place or places caused by
their occupation by other ships.
So it seems clear that the "lay days" provided for said vessels should not be held to begin to run against the United
States until after the arrival of the vessels in question at the
wharf. Bereton v Chapman, 5 Moo. P 526, Bremner v Bunell,

It is only a question of whether or not, under the circumstances surrounding this particular case, the delivery of 4,634

It seems clear that it was.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellant is a general commission merchant and shipper
at San Francisco. He filed his petition in the Court of Claims,
consisting of two paragraphs, in the first of which he claimed
reimbursement from the United States of the sum of 81,053.36,
demurrage paid by him for the~detention over lay days of two
ships chartered by him to transport coals to Honolulu and there
to be delivered to the United States. By the second paragraph he prayed the recovery of the sum of $1,120.87, the

Opinion of the Court.

difference between the contract price of 366 tons of coal, which
the United States refused to receive, and the price obtained
for the same upon the sale in open market.
The causes of action rested on two contracts entered into by
appellant with the United States through the proper officer of
the Quartermaster's Department, United States Army, by
which appellant agreed to furnish and deliver to that Department, Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, "at the wharf," about
3q900 tons of the best merchantable "Wallsend" Australian
steam coal, at the rate of not less than 100 tons a day, at
2,240 pounds to the ton, dangers of the sea and any causes
beyond appellant's control excepted, the deliveries to commence on the arrival of the Hawaiian ship Euterpe at Honolulu, on or about July 23, 1898, for and in consideration of
which appellant was to be paid at the office of the Quartermaster, United States Army, at San Francisco, California,
at the rate of $9 per ton, in gold coin of the United States.
And by the second contract appellant was to deliver "on
wharf, as customary," about 5,000 tons of the best merchantable Australian, Seaham, Wa~fle or Pacific Co6perative steam
coal, deliveries to commence at Honolulu on or about October 1, 1898. The other facts were found by the Court of
Claims, as follows:
"III. That at the respective times these contracts were made
it was the custom at San Francisco, between shippers and shipowners to insert in their charter parties a stipulation to the
effect that cargoes were to be discharged as customary, in such
customary berth or place as consignee shall direct, ship being
always afloat, and at an average specified number of tons per
weather working days (Sundays and holidays excepted), to
commence when ship is ready t6 discharge, and notice thereof
has been given by the captain in writing, and if detained over
and above the said laying days, demurrage to be at 4d. register
ton per day, which stipulation was duly inserted in the contract of the claimant with the ships employed by him to transport the coal mentioned in the contracts. It does not appear

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

that the officers and agents of the defendant, who were authorized to make, and did make, the contracts for the defendant, had knowledge or notice of such custom, nor that the
contracts or either of them were rhade in view of such custom.
"IV The claimant [appellant] discharged his said contracts
as follows: The first contract: By the arrival at Honolulu of
the ship Euterpe with 1,543 tons of coal, July 31, 1898, which
was placed in berth at the wharf by the harbormaster of said
port August 8, 1898, at 2.15 P i., and commenced discharging
coal at 3 P i. same day, and finished August 29, 1898, consummg eighteen working days. If she had been discharged
at not less than 100 tons per day, the time consumed would
have been sixteen days. It does not appear that the defendant was at fault either in the loss of time in arriving at the
wharf, nor in the discharge of the cargo afterwards. The court
finds the defendant was able, ready and willing to receive the
cargo as rapidly as discharged at the wharf. The claunant
paid to the shipowner $1,053.36 demurrage for these delays.
"The second contract: 1. By the arrival of the bark Harvester, with 2,179 tons of coal, August 28, 1898, at Honolulu,
which was placed at a berth at the wharf by the harbormaster
September 16, 1898, and began discharging coal on that date,
and completed same October 7, 1898, a period of eighteen
working days. It does not appear that the defendant was at
fault m the loss of time of said last-mentioned ship in arriving
at the wharf. 2. By the arrival of the ship General Gordon
at Honolulu, August 27, 1898, with 2,455 tons of coal. While
at anchor, September 9, 10 and 11, 330 tons were discharged
into steamship Arizona, a transport of defendant, for its own
use, after which the Gordon was placed at a berth at the
wharf by the harbormaster, September 14, at 1 P i., and
then commenced the further discharge of the cargo, completing the same October 4, no delays having occurred at the
wharf. It does not appear the defendant was at fault in the
ship's delay in reaching the wharf. In the case of each ship
the defendants had notice in writing of their respective arriv-

MOORE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

als within twenty-four hours thereafter. The wharves at
Honolulu are under the control of a harbormaster. The practice of such harbormaster was to assign ships to berths at the
wharves m the order of their respective arrivals, and this practice was followed by him in respect to the ships mentioned.
Claimant paid said shipowners for delays $1,433.12 to the
Harvester and $744.48 to the General Gordon. All coal delivered was paid for by defendant.
"V The coal actually delivered under the second contract
was 4,634 tons, completed October 7, 1898. About a month
subsequent to this claimant purchased 366 tons of coal of the
barkentine Omega, then in the Honolulu harbor, and tendered
the same to the defendant upon its contract of June 23, 1898,
but the defendant refused to receive it, whereupon claimant
sold the same in market, for the best price he could obtain, at
$3.061 per ton less than $9, the contract price with the defendant, equivalent to $1,120.87 in all, and to his loss m that
amount.
"VI. At the time of the delivery of the coal mentioned in
the foregoing findings the Honolulu harbor had eleven docks
or wharves, three of which only were used for the discharge
of coal. The docks were crowded, and several vessels were
moored at the reef. By local regulations of the Government,
a harbormaster had general supervision of all vessels in the
harbor, and all vessels were anchored and assigned to berths,
in the order of their arrival, by the harbormaster. There were
no lighters for public use, and defendant had none at the port,
and it was usual or customary to discharge freight upon the
wharves. The defendant had no authority over the wharves,
and was subject to local regulations, and the order of the
harbormaster, the same as individuals."
As a conclusion of law the court decided that appellant was
not entitled to recover. 38 C. Cl. 590.
The question in the case is whether the delay at Honolulu
in the delivery of the coal was caused by the United States or
by appellant; or, in other words, whether it was the duty- of

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

the United States to designate and furnish a wharf for the discharge of the coal from the ships, or its duty only to receive
the coal at the wharf when delivered there by appellant.
The question is one of law Any fault in fact upon the part
of the Uniited States is excluded by the findings of the court.
The cause of delay is expressly found to have been due to the
conditions in Honolulu harbor, and that to these conditions
the United States was as subordinate and subject as appellant.
The liability of the United States is asserted, nevertheless, on
account of the custom existing in San Francisco between
shippers and shipowners.
But the terms of the contracts are explicitly opposite to the
custom. The custom requires a consignee to designate a berth
for the discharge of cargo, and is hence responsible, it is contended, for the delays to a ship in reaching the berth, though
caused by the conditions existing at the port of discharge.
The contracts have no such provision, nor do they refer to the
charter parties entered into between claimant and the ships.
The contracts require delivery to be "at wharf" (first contract), "on wharf as customary" (second contract). "As customary" meant the mode of discharging freight at Honolulu.
Carver, Carriage by Sea, 696. The custom there was to discharge freight upon the wharves. The terms of the contracts,
therefore, are reinforced by the custom at Honolulu, and the
custom at San Francisco cannot prevail against them.
The effect of usage upon the contracts of parties has been
decided many times. It may be resorted to in order to make
definite what is uncertain, clear up what is doubtful, or annex
incidents, but not to vary or contradict the terms of a contract. Various applications of this principle are presented m
the following cases: Barnard v Kellogg, 10 Wall. 383, Heame
v Marine Ins. Co., 20 Wall. 488, The Insurance Companies v
Wright, 1 Wall. 456, Oelrcks v Ford, 23 How 49; Hostetter v.
Park, 137 U S. 30; Nattonal Bank v Burkhardt, 100 U S. 686.
We do not think it is necessary to make a detailed review of
these cases or of the cases which appellant has cited in which

MOORE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

consignees have been charged with demurrage. To trace and
relate the various conditions upon which consignees have been
held liable would extend this opinion to toogreat length, and discuss matters irrelevant to the case as we regard it. In all of
the cases cited there was an omission of duty on the part of the
consignees. In the case at bar there was no omission of duty,
and, besides, the United States was not a consignee of the coal
in any proper sense of that word. There was no privity between it and the ships. Its contract was to receive coal at the
wharf and pay for it on delivery there, after inspection. Its
contract was not to receive coal in lighters or to bear any expense in the transportation to the wharves. It is manifest
that coal on board ships in a harbor is not in the same situation
as coal on a wharf. The wharf, under the contract, was the
place of destination, and the appellant took the chances, as
observed by the Court of Claims, of obstacles which should
intervene to delay the delivery of the coal at the wharf, as they
did of other obstacles which might have intervened to prevent
the coal reaching tle harbor. It was not strictly the coal in
the ships that the United States contracted to take. It was
certain quantities of coal, and on account of this, in the exercise
of their rights under the second contract, appellant bought
coal in the open market and tendered it in fulfillment of that
contract. The liability of the United States to accept we shall
presently consider. We cite the fact now as illustrating the
meaning of the contract. It is manifest from these views the
Court of Claims was right in holding the United States was not
liable for the delay caused to the ships by the conditions which
existed in Honolulu harbor.
2. By the terms of the second contract (June 23, 1898) the
appellant agreed to deliver and the United States agreed to
"receive about 5,000 tons" of coal, delivery to commence with
about 2,200 tons, to arrive at Honolulu on or about the first
day of October, 1898. By the seventh of October delivery
was made of 4,634 tons. About a month subsequently appellant purchased 366 tons of coal of a ship then in the harbor,

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Oourt.

196 U. S.

and tendered the coal to the United States in fulfillment of the
contract to deliver 5,000 tons. The United States refused to
receive it, and appellant sold it m the open market for $3.06per ton less than $9, the contract price. This was the best
price which could be obtained, and the loss to appellant was
$1,120.87 The Court of Claims held that the appellant was
not entitled to recover. We think this was error. The obligations of parties were reciprocal, one to deliver, the other to
receive, about 5,000 tons of coal, and equally reciprocal is the
liability for non-performance of the obligations. The only
question can be, is 366 tons less than 5,000 tons, "about
5,000 tons"? We think not. The difference is too great.
We said in Brawley v United States, 96 U S. 168, 172, that in
engagements to furnish goods to a certain amount, the quantity
specified is material and governs the contract. "The addition
of the qualifying words 'about,' 'more or less,' and the like, in
such cases, is only for the purpose of providing against accidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excesses
or deficiencies m number, measure or weight." See also Cabot
v Winsor, 1 Allen, 546, 550; Salmon v Boykin, 66 Maryland,
541, Indianapolis Cabinet Co. v Herrman, 7 Ind. App. 462;

Simpson-v N Y., N H. & H. R. R. Co., 38 N. Y Supp.
341, 342.

The record does not inform us why the United States refused the tender, and we must assume that it had no other
justification than its supposed right under the contract.
