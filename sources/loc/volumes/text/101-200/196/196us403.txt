Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

SMALL v. RAIKESTRAW
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MONTANA.
No. 133. Argued January 18,1905.-Decided January 30, 1905.

A homestead claimant in a contest in the Land Department admitted he
voted m a precinct in Montana other than that in which the land was
situated, and that he returned there only often enough to keep up a good
showing. The Secretary of the Interior, after reviewing some of the
facts, ",without passing upon any other question" laid down that a
residence for voting purposes elsewhere precluded claiming residence at
the same time on the land and decided against the claimant.
Held that the Secretary found as a fact, by implication, that the plaintiff
not only voted elsewhere, but resided elsewhere for voting, that as the
case presented no exceptional circumstances, this court was not warranted in going behind these findings of fact and that the words "without
passing on any other question" could not be taken absolutely to limit
the ground of decision to the proposition of law but merely emphasized
one aspect of the facts dominant in the Secretary's mind.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr William E. Harvey were- on the brief, for plaintiff in errorThe action of the officers of the land office was not conclusive
and a court of equity may afford relief if proper cause is shown.

Voting m another precinct is no bar, and the Secretary's
decision m this respect is not correct in law See Montana

settlement and he cannot take advantage of it.

Opinion of the Court.

defendant with a trust in respect of land which the latter holds
under a patent from the United States. It alleges a homestead entry by the plaintiff, a contest by the defendant, a
decision for the defendant by the local register and receiver,
a reversal of this by the Commissioner of the Land Office, and
a reversal of the latter decision and a cancelation of the plaintiff's entry by the Secretary of the Interior. The last order is
set forth m full and the complaint goes on the ground that
this order discloses a mistake of law on its face. The complaint was demurred to, the demurrer was sustained, and the
suit dismissed. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court
of the State, which affirmed the judgment. 28 Montana, 413.
The case then was brought here.
The material portion of the Secretary's decision is as follows:
"January 21, 1892, plaintiff 1 filed his affidavit of contest
against the defendant's homestead entry charging that the
entryman had failed to comply with the law as to residence.
The testimony of Small, himself, is that he never voted in he
precinct in which his homestead entry lies, but did vote at
other points a long distance from his homestead at least twice
during the time he claims he was seeking to maintain residence
upon the land. He runs a carpenter shop in town, and, to
use his own words, 'determined to return to the ranch only
often enough to keep a good showing of habitation.' His
excuse for that was that the plaintiff I threatened him with
violence if he undertook to stay on the land.
"Without passing upon any other question it is enough to
say that a residence for voting purposes in another precinct
from the land, precludes an entryman from claiming residence
at the same time, on the land for homestead purposes. George
T Barnes, 4 L. D 62, Hart v McHugh, 17 L. D 176, Edwards
v Ford and O'Connor, decided June 18, 1894."
The plaintiff's case rests on the assumption that the words
"without passing upon any other question," mean without

passing upon any other question than an absolute proposition
of law, and that this proposition is that a vote in another
precinct is fatal to a claim of residence. But the Secretary
found, by implication, that the plaintiff not merely voted elsewhere, but resided elsewhere for voting. It was after this
finding that he laid down the rule complained of. The case
presents no exceptional circumstances which would warrant
our going behind the finding of fact. Bohall v Dilla, 114
U S. 47, Lee v Johnson, 116 U S. 48, 51, Stewart v McHarry,
159 U S. 643, 650. The plaintiff admits that on one occasion
after his entry he voted in a county other than that in which
the land lies, so that it appears from the complaint that there
was some evidence that his residence for voting was not in the
latter county, and, as the Supreme Court of Montana remarks,
it does not appear clearly that all the facts before the Secretary
are those set forth. It is true that a vote in another county is
only a circumstance to be considered, but when it leads to the
conclusion of a voting residence elsewhere it leads to the conclusion of a residence elsewhere for all purposes by the very
words of the Compiled Statutes of Montana on which the
plaintiff relies. §§ 1007, 1020.
In view of what we have said it does not appear as matter
of law that the Secretary's finding of voting residence was
wrong, and it does not appear that his proposition, taken as a
proposition of law, was wrong. But, further, the words,
"without passing on any other question" cannot be taken
absolutely to limit the ground of decision to the proposition
of law It hardly goes further than to emphasize one aspect
of the facts as dominant in the Secretary's mind. He already
had adopted the plaintiff's own words as establishing that the
plaintiff's purpose was only to keep up a good showing. This
goes to the general conclusion which the Secretary drew and
shows that it was a conclusion, not from the plaintiff's voting
residence merely, but from other facts.
Judgment affirmed.
