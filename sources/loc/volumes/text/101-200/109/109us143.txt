obvious, however, that the natural division of wools into -the
grades of unwashed, washed, and scoured,. carried'into the act
as the ground of difference in the amount of duties to be assessed accordingly, fully explains the intenti6n of Congress to
tax the wool itself uniformly by varying the amount of duty
according to the degree to which a. given quantity has been"
freed, by processes of cleansing from the dirt and foreign matter with which, in its unwashed state, it is usually found.

Sazary-tatute.
When Congress appropriates a sum "in full compensation" of the salary of a
public officer, the incumbent cannot recover an additional sum in the court
of claims, notwithstanding a prior statute fixes the salary at a largeramount
than the sum so appropriated.
In such case the earlier act is suspended for the time covered by the appropriation.

The appellee, Fisher, held the office of -Chief Justice of the
Territory of Wyoming, from February 14th, 1876, to :November 26th; 1879. Up to and including June 30th, 1877, he was
paid his salary at the rate Of $3,000 per annum. From June
30th, 1877, up to and including November 26th, 1879, he was
paid and received, without protest,- compensation as such chief
justice, at the rate of $2,600 per annum.

The appellee, contqnding that he was entitled to a salary at
the Tate of $3,000 per annum for his whole term of service,
brought this suit in the court of claims to recover the difference
between what his salary at that rate would have been from
June 30th, 1877, up to and including November 26th, 1879, and
the amount actually paid him fon that period.
The majority of the court of claims was of opinion that the

WooDs delivered the opinion of the court.

The act of June 1'tth, 18TO, entitled "An Act to regulate
the salaries of chief justices and associate justices in the Territories," 16 Stat. 152; Rev. St. ยง 1879, provided as follows:
"The salaries of the chief justices and associgte justices of the
Territories of New Mexico, Washington, Wyoming, etc., shall
be three thousand dollars ,each per annum."
This statute remaining in force, Congress, on March 3d, 1877,
passed an act entitled "An Act making appropriations for the
legislative, executive and judicial expenses of the government
for the year ending June 30t6, 1878, and for other purposes."
19 Stat. 294. This act declared as follows:
"That the following sums be and the same are hereby appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation for the service 4f the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1878, for the objects hereinafter expressed.
"Government in the Territories.
"Territory of WryQming. For salaries of governor, chief justice and two associate judges, at two thousand six hundred dollars
each."
The. act of June 19th, 1818, making appropriations for the
fiscal year ending June 80th, 1819, contained similar provisions
in the same language.' 20 Stat. 178, 194. The act of June 21st,
189, 21 Stat. 23,. making appropriations for the fiscal year
ending June 30th, 1880, appropriated "the same sums of money

UNITED STATES v. FISHER.
Opinion of the Court.

and for like purpose (and continuing the same provisions relating thereto) as were appropriated for the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1879," by the act above referred to makibg appropriations for that year. With the exception of the words "in full
compensation," the opening clause of these acts is substantially
the same as that used in all other appropriation acts of every
description since the foundation of the government.
Upon this state of the statute law the question is presented
whether from June 30th, 1877, up to and including November
26th, 1879, the appellee was entitled to a salary at the rate of
$3,000 per annum, or at the rate of $2,600 per annum. The
contention of appellee is that under the act of June 17th, 1810,
he was entitled to a salary of $3,000; notwithstanding the subsequent legislation above referred to.
We cannot concur in this view. The act of June 17th, 1880,
fixing the annual salary of appellee at $3,000, was not a contract that the salary should not be reduced during his term of
office. Butl-r v. Pennsylvania,10 How. 402. -Norwas there
any provision of the Constitution which forbade a reduction.
Clinton v. Engebneck, 18 Wall. 434.
Congress therefore could, without the violatioii of any contract, reduce the salary of appellee, and had the constitutional
power to do so.
Certain well-settled rules of interpretation are applicable to
this case. One is that a legislative act is to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislation apparent upon its
face, WTIkiwno* v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627; another, that, if possible, effect must be given to every clause, section, and word of
the statute, Bacon's Abr. Statute, I. 2.; Powitr's Case, 11 Coke,
29a, 34a; Potter's Dwarris, 194; Opinion of the Justices, 22
Pick. 571 ; and a third, that where two acts are in irreconcilable conflict the later repeals the earlier act, even though there
be no express repeal. Xfe Cool v. Smith, 1 Black, 459; United
States v. Tynen, 11 Wall 88; Red Book v. ffeny, 106 U. S.
596; United States v. Inim, 5 McLean, 178; West v. Pine, 4
Wash. 691 ;. Britton v. Commonwealth, 1 Cush. 302.
Applying these rules, we think that the appropriation acts
above referred to, so far as they concern the question in hand,

are susceptible of but one meaning. Placing side by side the
two clauses of the statute which relate to this controversy, their
plain effect is toappropriate $2,600 for the salary of the appellee for one year, and to declare that the sum so appropriated
shall be in full compensation for his services as chief justice for
the year specified. There is no ambiguity and no room for construction.
We .cannot adopt the view of appellee unless we eliminate
from the statute the words "in full compensation," which Congress, abandoning the long-used form of the appropriation acts
has, ex industria, inserted. Our duty is to give them effect.
When Congress has said that the sum appropriated shall be
in full compensation of the services of the appellee, we cannot
say that it shall not be in full compensation, and allow him a
greater sum.
Not only do the words of the statute make the intention of
Congress manifest, but that intention is plainly repugnant to
the former statute, which fixes the yearly salary of the chief
justice at $3,000. It is impossible that both acts should stand.
No ingenuity can reconcile them. The later act must therefore prevail, and the earlier act must for the time covered by
the appropriation acts above referred to be considered as suspended. The result of these views is that the judgment of the
court of claims, which gives the appellant a salary at the rate
of $3,000 per annum from June 30th, 1871, to November 26th,
1879, must be reversed, and
