EVANS, Plaintiff in Error, v. BROWN.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES 1o7

THE DISTRICTI-OF2NEVAD A.

Practice.

On motion to dismiss, with which is united, -underRule 6, a motion to affirm,
the motion to affirm will be granted when it appears that the questions
presented are fivolous, and that the case is brought here for delay only.
M.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

The writ of error in this case was not made returnable on
any partikulax day. This, if the defect is not cured by amendment, entitles the defendant in error to a dismissal, but the
plaintiff in error asks leave, under the autholity of sec. 1005,
Rev. Stat., to amend the writ by inserting the proper return
day. That leave we grant, and therefore overrule the motion
to dismiss, but on looking into the record we find the case was
manifestly brought here for delay only. All the questions
presented axe so frivolous as not to need further argument.
The motion to affirm is granted.
