THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR THE MIDDLE

DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
Submitted October Term, 188.-Decided October 15th, 1883.

Practice

This court will not take cognizance of a division of opinion between the judges
of a circuit court on a mtion to quash an indictment.

MR.JUSTICE Bi3ni

delivered the opinion of the court.

The certificate of division in this case was made on a division
in opinion between the judges on a motion to quash the indictment. As a motion to quash is always addressed to the discretion of the court, a decision upon it is not error, and cannot
be reviewed on a writ of error. In the case of UJnited States
v. Bo8enburgh, I7Wall. 580, we decided the precise point, that
this court cannot take cognizance of a division of opinion between the judges of a circuit court upon a motion to quash an
indictment. This decision was re-affirmed in United States v.
Avery, 13 Wall. 251, and in' United States v. Cand, decided
at October term 1881.
Thie case, not being pro2erly before us, is di&missed.
