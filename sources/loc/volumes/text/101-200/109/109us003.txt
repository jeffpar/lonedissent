1. The 1st and 2d sections of the Civil Rights Act passed March 1st, 1875,
are unconstitutional enactments as applied to the several States, not
being authorized either by the XIllth or XTVth Amendments of the
Constitution.
2. The XIVth Amendment is prohibitory upon the States only, and the legislation authorized to be adopted by Congress for enforcing it is not direct
legislation on the matters respecting which the States are prohibited from
maling or enforcing certain laws, or doing certain acts, but is corrective
legislation, such as may be necessary or proper for counteracting and
.redressing tho effect of such laws or acts.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Statement of Facts.
8. The XIIIth Amendment relates only to slavery and involuntary servitude
(which it abolishes) ; and although, by its reflex action, it establishes
universal freedom in tlie United States, and Congress may probably pass
laws directly enforcing its provisions; yet such legislative power extends
only to the subject of slavery and its incidents ; and the denial of equal
accommodations in inns, public conveyances and places of public amuse.
ment (which is forbidden by the sections in question), imposes no badge of
slavery or involuntary servitude upon the party, but at most, infringes
rights which are protected from State aggression by the XIVth Amendment.
4. Whether the accommodations and privileges sought to be protected by the
1st and 2d sections of the Civil Rights Act, are, or are not, rights constitutionally demandable ; and if they are, in what form they are to be protected, is not now decided.
5. Nor is it decided whether the law as it stands is operative in the Territories
and District of Columbia : the decision only relating to its validity as
applied to the States.
6. Nor is it decided whether Congress, under the commercial power, may or
may not pass a law securing to all persons equal accommodations on lines
of public conveyance between two or more States.

These cases were all founded on the first and second sections
of the Act of Congress, known as the Civil Rights Act, passed
March 1st, 1875, entitled "An Act to protect all citizens in
their civil and legal rights." 18 Stat. 335. Two of the cases,
those against Stanley and Nichols,, were indictments for denying to persons of color the accommodations and privileges
of an inn oi hotel; two of them, those against Ryan and
Singleton, were, one on information, the other an indictment,
for denying to individuals the privileges and accommodations

of a theatre, the information against Ryan being for refusing a
colored person a seat in the dress circle of Maguire's theatre in
San Francisco; and the indictment against Singleton was for
denying to another person, whose color was not stated, the full
enjoyment of the accommodations of the theatre known as the
Grand Opera House in New York, "said denial not being

made for any reasons -by law applicable to citizens of every
race and color, and regardless of any previous condition of
servitude." The case of Robinson and.wife against the Memphis & Charleston .R.R. Company was an'action brought in

of Tennessee, to recover the penalty of five hundred dollars

given by the second section of 'the act; and the gravamen was
the refusal by the conductor of the railroad company to allow
the wife to ride in the ladies' car, for the reason, as stated in
one of the counts, that she was a person of African descent.
The jury rendered a verdict for the defendants in this case
upon the merits, under a charge of the court to which a bill of
exceptions was taken by the plaintiffs. The case was tried on
the assumption by both parties of the validity of the act of
Congress; and the principal point made by the exceptions was,
that 'the judge allowed evidence to go to the jury tending to
show that the conductor had reason to suspect that the plaintiff, the wife, was an improper person, because she was in company with a young man whom he supposed to be a white man,
and on that account inferred that there was some improper
connection between them; and the judge charged the jury, in
substance, that if this was the conductor's bona Xfde reason for
excluding the woman from the car, they might take it into
consideration on the question of the liability of the company.
The case was brought here by writ of error at the suit of the
plaintiffs. The cases of Stanley, Nichols, and Singleton, came
up on certificates of division of opinion between the judges
below as to the constitutionality of the farst and second sections
of the act referred to; and the case of Ryan, on a writ of
error to the judgment of the Circuit Court for the District of
California sustaining a demurrer to the information.
The Stanley, Ryan, Nichols, and Singleton cases were su>
mitted together by the solicitor general at the last term of
court, on the '7th day of November, 1882. There were no
appearances and no briefs fied for the defendants.
The Robinson case was submitted on the briefs at the last
term, on the 29th day of March, 1883.

'Upon the whole these cares decide that,
1. The Thirteenth Amendmenf forbids all sorts of involuntary personal servitude except penal, as to all sorts of men, the
word servitude taking some color from the historical fact that
the United States were then engaged in dealing with African
slavery, as well as from the signification of the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments, which must be construed as advancing constitutional rights previously existing.
2.: The Fourteenth Amendment expresses prohibitions (and
consequently implies corresponding positive immunities), limiting State action only, including in such action, however, action
by all Siate agencies, executive, legislative, and judicial, of
whatever degree.
3. The Fourteenth Amendment warrants legislation by Congress punishing violations of the immunities thereby secured
when committed by agents of States in discharge of ministerial
functions.
The right violated by Nichols, which is of the same class as
that violated by Stanley and by Hamilton, is the right of locomotion, which Blackstone makes an element of personal liberty.
Blackstone's Commentaries, Book I., ch. 1.
In violating this right, Nichols did not act in an exclusively
private capacity, but in one devoted to a public use, and so
affected with a public, i.e., a State, interest.. This phrase will
be recognized as taken from the Elevator Cases in 94 U. S.,
already
cited.

feature of the slavery abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment.A first requisite of the right to appropriate the use of another
man was to become the master of his natural power of motion,
and, by a mayhem therein of the common law to require the
whole community to be on the alert to restraiii that power.
That this is not exaggeration is shown by the language of the
court in Eaton v. T'aughan, 9 Missouri, 734-.
Granting that by involuntary servitude, as prohibited in the
Thirteenth Amendment, is intended some institutian,viz., custom, etc., of that sort, and not primarily mere scattered trespasses against liberty committed by private persons, yet, considering what must be the social tendency in at least largeparts of the country, it is "appropriate legislation" against
such an institution to forbid any action by private persons
which in the light of our history may reasonably be apprehended to tend, on account of its being incidental to quasi
public occupations, to create an institution.
Therefore, the above act of 1875, in prohibiting persons
from violating the rights of other persons to the full and equal
enjoyment of the accommodations of inns and public conveyances, for any reason turning merely upon the race or color of
the latter, partakes of the specific character of certain contemporaneous solemn and effective action by the United States to
which it was a sequel-and is constitutional

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

In Wun n v. ilinoig, 94 U. S. 113, the following propositions
were affirmed:
"Under the powers inherent in every sovereignty, a government may regulate the conduct of its citizens toward each other,

and, when necessary for the public good, the manner in which
each shall use his own property."
"It has, in the exercise of these powers, been customary in
England from time immemorial, and in this country from its
first colonization, to regulate ferries, common carriers, hackmen,
bakers, millers, wharfingers, innkeepers, etc."
"When the owner of property devotes it to a use in which the
public has an interest, he in effect grants to the public an interest in such use, and .must, to the extent of that interest, submit
to be controlled by the public, for the common good, as long as
he maintains the use."
Undoubtedly, if Congress could- legislate on the subject at
all, its legislation by the act of 1st March, 1875, was within
the principles th 2s announced.
The penalty, lenounced by the statute is incurred by denying to any citizan " the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges" enumerated in the
.first section, and it is wholly immaterial whether the citizen
whose rights are denied him belongs to one race or class
or another, or is of one complexion or another. And again,
the penalty follows every denial of the.full enjoyment of any
of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges,
except and unless the denial was "for reasons ly law applicable
to citizens of every race and color, and regardless of any previous condition of servitude."

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

the cases is the constitutionality of the law: for if the law is
unconstitutional none of the prosecutions can stand.
The sections of the law referred to provide as follows:
"SEC. 1. That all persons within the jurisdiction of the United
States shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the
accommodationS, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns,
public conveyances on land or water, theatres, and other places
of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitationps established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of every
race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude.
"SEc. 2. That any person who shall violate the foregoing sec-:
tion by denying to any citizen, except for reasons by law applicable to citizens of every race and color, and regardless of any
previous condition of servitude, the full enj'oyment of any of the
accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges ill said sectior enumerated, or by aiding or inciting such denial, shall for
every such offence forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars to-the person aggrieved thereby, to be recovered in an action
of debt, with full- costs ; and shall also, for avery such offence,
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined not less than five hundred nor more than
one thousand dollars, or shall be imprisoned not less than thirty
days nor more than one year: Provided, That all persons may
elect to sue for the penalty aforesaid, or to proceed under their
rights at common law and by State statutes; and having so
elected to proceed in the one mode or the other, their right to
proceed in the other jurisdiction shall be barred. But this provision shall not apply to criminal proceedings, either under this
act or the criminal law of any State: And providedfurther, That
a judgment for the penalty in favor of the party aggrieved, or
a judgment upon an indictment, shall be a bar to either prosecu-.
tion respectively."

Are' these sections constitutional? The first section, which
is the principal one, cannot be fairly understood without
attending to.the last clause, which qualifies the preceding part.
The essence of the law is, not to declare broadly that all
persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the

accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns,

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

public conveyances, and theatres; but that such enjoyment
shall not be subject to any conditions applicable only to citizens of a parti~ular race or color, or who had been in a previous condition of servitude. In other words, it is the purpose
of the law to declare that, in the enjoyment of the accommodations and privileges of inns, public conveyances, theatres,
and other places of public amusement, no distinction shall be
made between citizens of different race or color, or between
those who have, and those who have not, been slaves. Its
effect is to declare, that in a1 inns, public conveyances, and
places of amusement, colored citizens, whether formerly slaves
or not, and 6itizens of dther races, shall have the same accommodations and privileges in all inns, public conveyances, and
places of amusement as are enjoyed by white citizens; and vice
versa. The second section makes it a penal offence in any person to deny to any citizei of any race or color, regardless of
previqus servitude, any of the accommodations or privileges
mentioned in the flrst section.
Has.Congress constitutional power to make such a law ? Of
course, no one will contend that the power to pass it was contained in the Constitution before the adoption of the last three
amendments. The power is sought, first, in the Fourteenth
Amendment, and the, views and arguments of distinguished
Senators, advanced whilst the law was under consideration,
claiming authority to pass it by virtue of that'amendment, are
the principal arguments adduced in favor of the power. We
have carefully considered those arguments, as was due to the
eminent ability of those who put them forward, and have felt,
in all its force, the weight of authority which always invests a
law that Congress deems itself competent to pass. But the
responsibility of an independent judgment is now thrown upon
this court; and we are bound to exercise it according to the
best lights we have.
The first section of the Fourteenth Amendment (which is
the one relied on), after declaring who shall be citizens of
the United States, and of the several States, is prohibitory
in its character, and prohibitory upon the States. It declares
that:

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
nor shall any State deprive any personof life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person, within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited.
Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subjectmatter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader'scope.
It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, andState action
of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of
citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies
to any of them the equal protection of the laws. It not only
does this, but, in order that the national will, thus declared,
may not be a mere brutum fulmen, the last section of the
amendment invests Congress with power to enforce it by
appropriate legislation. 'To enforce what. To enforce the
prohibition. To adopt appropriate legislation for correcting.
the effects of such prohibited State Jaws and State acts, and
thus to render them effectually null, void, and innocuous.
This is the legislative power conferred upon Congress, and this
is the whole of it. It does not invest Congress .with power to
legislate upon subjects which are within the domain of State
legislation; but to provide modes of relief against State legislation, or State action, of the lind referred to. It does not
authorize Congress to create a code 'of municipal law for the
re oulation of private rights; but to provide modes:6f redress
against the operation of State laws, and the action of State
officers executive or judicial, when these are subversive of the
fundamental rights specified in the amendment. Positive rights
and privileges are undoubtedly secured by the Fourteenth
Amendment; but they are secured by way of prohibition
against State laws and State proceedings affecting those rights
and privileges, and by power given to Congress to legislate for
the purpose of carrying such prohibition into effect. and such
legislation must necessarily be predicated upon such supposed
State Jaws or State proceedings, and be directed to the correc-

Opinion of the CourL

tion of their operation and effect. A quite full discussion of
this aspect of the amendment may be found in United State8
v. Cruikshznk, 92 U. S. 542; TFirgini v. ?ve8, 100 U. S. 313;
and _Ex parte 7irginia, 100 U. S. 339.
An apt illustration of this distinction may be found in some
of the provisions of the original Constitution. Take the subject Qf contracts, for example. The Constitution prohibited
the States from pasing any law impairing the obligation of
contracts. This did not give to Congress power to provide
laws for the general enforcement of contracts; nor power to
invest the courts of the United States with jurisdiction over
contracts, so as to enable parties to sue upon them in those
courts. It did, however, give the power to provide remedies
by which the impairment of contracts by State legislation
might be counteracted and corrected: and this power was
exercised. The remedy which Congress actually provided was
that contained in the*25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
1 Stat. 85, giving to the Supreme Court of the United States
jurisdiction by writ of error to review the final decisions of
State courts whenever they should sustain the validity of a
State statute or authority alleged to be repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States. By this means, if a
State law was passed impairing the obligation of a contract,
and the State tribunals sustained thd validity of the law, the
mischief could be corrected in this court. The legislation of
Congress, and the proceedings provided for under it, were corrective in their character. No attempt was made to draw into
the United States courts the litigation of contracts generally;
and.no such attempt would have been sustained. We do not
say that the remedy provided was the only one that might
have been provided in that case. Probably Congress had
power to pass a law giving to the courts of' the United States
direct jurisdiction over contracts alleged to be impaired by a
State law; and under the broad provisions of the act of March
3d, 1875, ch. 137, 1 Stat. 470, giving to the circuit courts jurisdiction of all cases arising under the Constitution and laws
'of the United States, it is possible that such jurisdiction now
exists. But under that, or any other law, it must appear as

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

well by allegation, as proof at the trial, that the Constitution
had been violated by the action of the State legislature." Some
obnoxious State law passed, or that might be.passed, is neces-sary to be assumed in order to lay the foundation of any federal remedy in the case; and for the very sufficient reason,
that the constitutional prohibition is against State Iaw8 impaixI
ing the obligation of contracts.
And so in the present case, until some State law .has bebn
pazsed, or some State action" through its officers or agents.hbs
been taken, adverse to the rights of citizens sought to -beprotectcd by the Fourteenth Amendment, no legiglation of the
II- 'ted States under said amendment, nor any proceeding under
such legislation, can be called into activity: for the prohibitions
of the ambndment are against State laws and acts done under
State authority. Of course, legislation may, and should be,
provided in advance to meet the exigency when it arises; but
it should be adapted to the mischief and wrong which the
amendment was intended to provide against; and that is, State
laws, or State action of some kind, adverse to therights of the
citizen secured by the amendment. Such legislation cannot
properly cover the whole domain of rights appertaining to life,
liberty and property, defining them and providing 'for thoir
vindication. That would be to establish a code of municipal
law regulative of all private rights between man and man in
society. It would be to make Congress take the place of the
State legislatures and to supersede them. It is absurd to affirm
that, because the rights of life, liberty and property (which include all civil rights that men have), are by the amendment
sought to be protected against invasion on the part of the State
without due process of law, Congress may therefore provide
due process of law for their vindication in every case; and that,
because the denial by a State to any persons, of the equal protection of the laws, is prohibited by the amendment, therefore
Congress may establish laws for their equal protection. In
fine, the legislation which Congress is authorized to adopt in
this behalf is not general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective legislation, that is, such as may be necessary
and proper for counteracting such laws as the States may

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited from making or enforcing, or such acts and proceedings
as the States may commit or take, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited from committing or taking. It is not
necessary for us to state, if we could, what legislation would
be proper for Congress to adopt. It is sufficient for us to examine whether the law in question is of that character.
An inspection of the law shows that it makes no reference
whatever to any supposed or apprehended violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment on the part of the States. It is not predicated on any such view. It proceeds ex d irecto to declare that
certain acts committed by individuals shall be deemed offences,
and shall be prosecuted and punished by proceedings in the
courts of the United States. It does not profess to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committed by the States; it
does not make its operation to depend upon any such wrong
committed. It applies- equally to cases arising in States which
have the justest laws respecting the personal rights of citizens,
and whose authorities are ever ready to enforce such laws, as
to those which arise in States that may have violated the prohibition of the amendment. In other words, it steps into the
domain of local jurisprudence, and lays down rules for the conduct of individuals in society towards each other, and imposes
sanctions for the enforcement of those rules, without referring
in any manner to any supposed action of the State or its authorities.
If this legislation is appropriate for enforcing the prohibitions
of the amendment, it is difficult to see where it is to stop. Why
may not Congress with equal show of authority enact a code of
laws for the enforcement and vindication of all rights of life,
liberty, and property? If it is supposable that the States may
deprive persons of life, liberty, and property without due process of law (and the amendment itself does suppose this), why
should not Congress -proceed at once to prescribe due process of
law for the protection of every one of these fundaniental rights,
in every possible case, as well as to prescribe equal privileges
in inns, public conveyances, and theatres? The truth is, that
the implication of a power to legislate in this manner is based

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

upon the assumption that if the States are forbidden to legislate
or act in a particular way on a particular subject, and power is
conferred upon Congress to enforce the prohibition, this gives
Congress power to legislate generally upon that subject, and
not merely power to provide modes of redress against such
State legislation or action. The assumption is certainly unsound. It is repugnant t6 the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which declares, that powers not delegated to the Unitld
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.
We have not overlooked the fact that the fourth section of
the act now under consideration has been held by this court to
be constitutional. That section declares "that no citizen, possessing all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed
by law, shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror
in any couri of the United States, or of any State, on account
of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; and any officer or other person charged with any duty in the selection or
smnmoning of jurors who shall exclude or fail to summon any
citizen for the cause aforesaid, shall, on conviction thereof, be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be fined not more than
five thousand dollars." In Ex parte V'ginia, 100 U. S. 339, it
was held that an indictment against a State officer under this
section for excluding persons of color from the jury list is sustainable. IBut a moment's attention to its terms will show that
the section is entirely corrective in its character. Disqualifications for service on juries are only created by the law, and the
first part of the section is aimed at certain disqualifying laws,
namely, those which make mere race or color a disqualification;
and the second clause is directed against those who, assuming.
to use the authority of the State government, carry into effect
such a rule of disqualification. In the Virginia case, the State,
through its officer, enforced a rule of disqualification which the
law was intended to abrogate and counteract. Whether the
statute book of the State actually laid down any such rule of
disqualific.ation, or not, the State, throughr its officer, enforced
such a rule: and it is against such State action, through its officers and agents, that the last clause of the section is directed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

This aspect of the law was deemed sufficient to divest it of any
unconstitutional character, and makes it differ widely from the
first and second sections of the same act which we are now
considering.,
These sections, in the objectionable features before refeired
to, are different also from the law ordinarily called the "Civil
Rights Bill," originally passed April 9th, 1866, 14 Stat. 27,
ch. 31, and re-enacted with some modifications in sections 16,
11, 18, of the Enforcement Act, .passed May 31st, 1870, 16
Stat. 140, ch. 114. That law, as re-enacted, after declaring that all persons .within the- jurisdiction of the United
States shall have the same right in every-State and Territory to
make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence,
and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for
the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white
citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses and exactions of every kind, and none other, any
law,statute, ordinance, regulation or custom to the contrar T
notwithstanding, proceeds to enact, that any. person who,
under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of
any State or Territory to the deprivation of any rights secured
or protected by the preceding section (above quoted), or to different punishment, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color or race, than is
prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and subject to fine and hnprisonment
as specified in the act. This law is clearly corrective in its
character, intended to counteract and furnish redress against
State laws and.proceedings, and customs having the force of
law, which sanction th-e wrongful acts specified. In the Revised Statutes, it is true, a very iniportant clause, to wit, the
words "any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom to
the contrary notwithstanding," which gave the declaratory
section its point and effect,: are omitted ; but the penal part, .by
which the declaration is enforced, and which is really the effebtive part of the law, retains the reference to State laws, by
making the penalty apply only to those who should subject

Opinion of the Court.

parties to a deprivation of their rights under color of any
statute, ordinance, custom, etc., of any State or Territory: thus
preserving the corrective character of the legislation. Rev. St.
8Â§ 1977, 1978, 1979, 5510. The Civil Rights Bill here referred
to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been
under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of
contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound
by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under c6lor or
pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State
law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the, courts of the
United States, with the addition of a .penalty for setting up
such an unjust and unconstitutional defence.
In this connection it is proper to state that civil rights, such
as are guaranteed by the Constitution against State aggression,
cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by State authority in the shape of laws, customs, or
judicial or executive proceedings. The wrongful act of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a private
wrong, or a crime of that individual; an invasion of the rights
of the injured party, it is true, whether they affect his person,
his property, or his reputation; but if not sanctioned in some
way by the State, or not done under State authority, his rights
remain in full force, and may presumably be vindicated by
resort to the laws of the State for redress. An individual cannot deprive a man. of his right to vote, to hold property, to buy

may, by force o.r fraud, interfere with the enjoyment of the
right m a particular case; he may commit an assault against
the person, or commit murder,. or use ruffian violence at the
polls, or slander the good name of a fellow citizen; but, unless
protected in these wrongful acts by some shield of State law or
State authority, he cannot destroy or injure .the right; he will
only render himself amenable to satisfaction or punishment;
and amenable therefor to the laws of the State where the
wrongful acts are committed. Hence, in all those cases where
the Constitution seeks to protect the rights of the citizen
against discriminative and unjust laws of the State by prohibiting such laws, it is not individual offences, but abrogation and

denial of rights, which it denounces, and for which it clothes
the Congress with power to provide a remedy. This abrogation and denial of rights, for whicL the States alone were or
could be responsible, was the great seminal and fundamental
wrong which was intended to be remedied. And the remedy
to be provided must necessarily be predicated upon that wrong.
It must assume that in the cases provided for, the evil or
wrong actually committed rests upon some State law or State
authority for its excuse and perpetration.
Of course, these remarks do not apply to those cases in which
Congress is clothed with direct and plenary powers of legislation over the whole subject, accompanied with an express or
implied denial of such power to the States, as in the regulation
of commerce with foreign nations, among the several States,
and with the Indian tribes, the coining of money, the establishment of post offices and post xeads, the declaring of war, etc.
In these cases Congress has power to pass laws for regulating
the subjects specified in every detail, and the conduct and
transactions of individuals in respect thereof. But where a
subject is not submitted to the general legislative power of
.Congress, but is only submitted thereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular State legislation or State action in reference to that subject, the power
given is limited by its object, and any legislation by Congress
in the matter must necessarily be corrective in its character,
adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited State laws or proceedings of State officers.
If the principles of interpretation which we have laid down
are correct, as we deem them to be (and they are in accord with
the principles laid down in the cases before referred to, as Well
as in the recent case of United State8 v. Jlan'i8, 106 U.S.629),
it isclear that the law in question cannot be sustained by any
grant of legislative power made to Congress by the Fourteenth
Amendment. That amendment prohibits the States from denying to any person the equal protection of the laws, and declares
that Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legis.
lation, the provisions of the amendment. The law in question,
without any reference to adverse State legislation on the sub,.

Opinion of the Court.

ject, declares that all persons shall be entitled to equal accommodations and privileges of inns, public conveyances, and
places of public amusement, and imposes a penalty upon any
individual who shall deny to any citizen such equal accommodations and privileges. This is not corrective legislation ; it is
primary and direct; it takes immediate and absolute possession
of the subject of the right of admission to inns, public conveyances, and places of amusement. It supersedes and displaces
State legislation on the same subject, or only allows it permissive
force. It ignores such legislation, and assumes that the matter
is one that belongs to the domain of national regulation.
Whether it would not have been a more effective protection of,
the rights of citizens to have clothed Congress with plenary
power over the whole subject, is not now the question. What
we have to decide is, whether such plenary power has been
conferred upon Congress by the Fourteenth Amendment; and,
in our judgment, it has not.
We have discussed the question presented by the law on the
assumption that a right to enjoy equal accommodation and
privileges in all inns, public conveyances, and places of public
amusement, is one of the essential rights of the citizen which no
State can abridge or interfere with. Whether it is such a right,
or not, is a different question which, in the view we have taken
of the validity of the law on the ground already stated, it is
not necessary to examine.
We have also discussed the validity of the law in reference
to cases arising in the States only; and not in reference to cases
arising in the Territories or the District of Columbia, which axe
subject to the plenary legislation of Congress in every branch
of municipal regulation. Whether the law would be a valid
one as applied to the Territories and the District is not a question for consideration in the cases before us: they all being
cases arising within the limits of States. And whether Congress, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce amongst
the several States, might or might not pass a law regulating
rights in public conveyances passing from one State to another,
is also a question which is not now before us, as the sections in
question are not conceived in any such view.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

But the power of Congress to adopt direct and primary, as
distinguished from corrective legislation, on the subject in hand,
is sought, in the second place, from the Thirteenth Amendment,
This amendment declares "that
which abolishes slavery.
neither slavery, -nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject
-to their jurisdiction;" and it gives Congress power to enforce
the amendment by appropriate legislation.
This amendment, as well as the Fourteenth, is undoubtedly
self-ex cuting without any ancillary legislation, so far as its
terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By
its own unaided force and effect it abolished slavery, and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary
and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to
be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for
its violation in letter or spirit. And such: legislation may be
primary and direct in its character; for the amendment is not
a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding
slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary
.servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.
It is true, that slavery cannot exist without law, any more
than property in lands and goods can exist without law: and,
theref6re, the Thirteenth Amendment may be regarded as
nullifying all State laws which establish or uphold slavery.
But it has a reflex character also, establishing and. decreeing
universal civil and political freedom throughout the United
States; and it is assumed, that the power vested in Congress t9
enforce the article by appropriate legislation, clothes Congress
with power to pass all laWs necessary and proper for abolishing
all.badges and incidents of slavery in the United States: and
upon this assumption it is claimed, that this is sufficient author-"
ity for declaring by law that all persons shall have equal
accommodations and privileges in all inns, public conveyances,
and places of amusement; the argument being, that the denial
of such equal accommodations and privileges is, in itself, a subjection to a species of servitude within the meaning of the
amendment. Conceding the major proposition to be true, that

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

Congress has a right to enact all nedessary and proper laws for
the obliteration and prevention of slavery with all its badges
and incid6nts, is the minor proposition also true, that the denial
to any person of admission to the accommodations and privileges
of an inn, a public conveyance, or a theatre, does subject that
person to any form of servitude, or tend to fasten upon him
any badge of slavery? If it does not, then power to pass the.
law is not found in the Thirteenth Amendment.
In a very able and learned presentation of the cognate question as to the extent of the rights, privileges and immunities of
citizens which cannot rightfully be abridged by state laws under
the Fourteenth Amendment, made in a former case, a long list
of burdens and disabilities of a servile'character, incident to
feudal vassalage in France, and which were abolished by the decrees of the National Assembly, was presented for the 1lu'rpose
of showing that all inequalities and observances exacted by one
man from another were servitudes, or badges of slavery, which
a great nation, in its effort to establish universal liberty, iiade
haste to wipe out and destroy. But these were servitudes imposed by the old law, or by long custom, which had the force
of law, and exacted by one man from another -without the
latter's consent. Should any such servitudes be imposed by a
state law, there can be no doubt that the law would be repugnant to the Fourteenth, no less than to the Thirteenth Amendment; nor any greater doubt that Congress has adequate power
to forbid any such servitude from being exacted.
But is there any similarity between such servitudes and a
denial by the owner of an inn, a public conveyance, or a theatre,
of its accommodations and privileges to an individual, even
though the denial be founded on the race or color of that individual? Where does any slavery or servitude, or badge of
either, arise from such an act of denial? Whether it might iot
be a denial of a right which, if sanctioned by the state law,
would be obnoxious to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth
Amendment, is another question., But what has it to do with
the question of slavery?
It may be that by the Black Code (as it was called), in the
times when slavery prevailed, the proprietors of inns and public

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

conveyances were forbidden to receive persons of the African
race, because it might assist slaves to escape from the control
of their masters. This was merely a means of preventing such
escapes, and was no part of the servitude itself. A. law of that
kind could not have any such object now, however justly it might
be deemed an invasion of the party's legal right as a citizen,
and amenable to theprohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Th. long existence of African slavery in this country gave
us very distinct notions of what it was, and what were its
necessary incidents. Compulsory service of the slave for the
benefit of the master, restraint of his movements except by the
master's will, disability to hold property, to make contracts, to*
have a standing in court, to be a witness against a white person, and such like burdens and incapacities, were the inseparable
incidents of the institution. Severer punishmaents for crimes
were imposed on the slave than on free persons guilty of the
same offences. Congress, as we have seen, by the Civil Rights'
Bill of 1866, passed in view of the Thirteenth Amendment,
before the Fourteenth was adopted, undertook to wipe out
these burdens and disabilitiesythe necessary incidents of slavery,
constituting its substance and visible form; and to secure to all
citizens of every race and color, and without regard to previous
servitude, those lundamental rights which are the essence of civil
freedom, namely, the same right to make and enforce contracts,
to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease,
sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.
Whether this legislation was fully authorized by the Thirteenth
Amendment alone, without the support which it afterward
received from the Fourteenth Amendment, after the adoption
of which it was re-enacted with some additions, it is not necessary to inquire. It is referred to- for the purpose of showing
that at that time (in 1866) Congress did not assume, under
the authority given by the Thirteenth Amendment, to adjust
what may be called the social rights of men and races in the
community; but only to declare and vindicate those fundamental rights which appertain to the'essence of -citizenship, and the
enjoyment or deprivation of which constitates the essential distinction between freedom and slavery.

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.',
Opinion of the Court.

We must not forget that the province and scope of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments are different; the former
simply abolished slavery: the latter prohibited the States from
abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States; from depriving them of life, liberty; or property without due process of law, and from denying to any the equal
protection of the laws. â€¢The amendments are different, and the
powers of Congress under them are different. What Congress
has power to do under one, it may not have power to do under
the other. Under the Thirteenth Amendment, it has only to do
with slavery and its incidents. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, it has power to counteract and render nugatory all State
laws and proceedings which have the effect to abridge any of
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, or
to deprive them of life, liberty or property without due process
of law, or to deny to any of them the equal protection of the laws.
Under the Thirteenth Amendment, the legislation, so far as
necessary or proper to eradicate all forms and incidents of slavery
and involuntary servitude, may be direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State
legislation or not; under the Fourteenth, as we have already
shown, it must necessarily be, and can only be, corrective in its
character, addressed to counteract and afford relief against State
regulations or proceedings.
The only question under the present head, therefore, is,
whether the refusal to any persons of the acconimodations of
an inn, or a public conveyance, or a place of public amusement,
by an individual, and without any sanction or support from
any State law or regulation, does inflict upon such persons any
manner of servitude, or form of slavery, as those terms are
understood in this country? Many wrongs may be obnoxious
to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment which are
not, in any just sense, incidents or elements of slavery..- Such, for*
example, would be the taking of private property without due
process of law; or allowing persons who have conmitted certain crimes (horse stealing, for examnple) to be seized and hung
by the yose camitatu8 without regular trial; or denying to any
person, or class of persons, the -right to pursue any peaceful

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opiwion of the Court

avocations allowed to others. What is called class legislation
would belong to this category, and would be obnoxious to the
prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but would not necessarily be so to the Thirteenth, when not involving the idea of any
subjection of one man to another. The Thirteenth Amendment
has respect, not to distinctions of race, or class, or color, but to
slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment extends its protection to
races and classes, and prohibits any State legislation which has
the effect of denying to any race or class, or to any individual,
the equal protection of the laws.
Now, conceding, for the sake of the argument, that the
admission to an inn, a public conveyance, or a place .of public
amusement, on equal terms with all other citizens, is the right
of every man and all classes of men, is it any more .than one of
those rights which the states by the Fourteenth Amendment are
forbidden to deny to any person? And is the Constitution violated
until the denial of the right has some State sanction or authority? Can the act of a mere individual, the owlier of theinn,
the public conveyance or place of amusement, refusing the
accommodation, be justly regarded as imposing any baage of
slavery or servitude upon the applicant, or only as inflicting an,
ordinary civil injury, properly cognizable by the laws of the
State, and presumably subject to redress by those laws until the
contrary appears?
After giving to these questions all the consideration which
their importance demands, we -are forced to the conclusion that
such an act of refusal has nothing tP do with slavery or involuntary servitude, and that if it is violative of any right of the
party, his redress is to be sought under the laws of the State;
or if those laws are adverse to his rights and do not protect
him, his remedy will be found in the corrective legislation
whidh Congress has adopted, or may adopt, for counteracting
the effect of State laws, or State action, prohibited by the
Fourteenth Amendment. It would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make~it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he
will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or
cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Opinion of the Court.
other matters of intercourse or business. Innkeepers and
public carriers, by the laws of all the States, so far as we are
aware, are bound, to the extent of their facilities, to furnish
proper accommodation to all unobjectionable persons who in
good faith apply for them. If the laws themselves make any
unjust discrimination, amenable to the prohibitions of the
Fourteenth Aimendment, Congress has full power to afford a
remedy under that amendment and in accordance with it.
When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the
aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable
concomitants of that state, there must be some stage in the
progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere
citizen, and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws, and
when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected in
the ordinary modes by which other men's rights are prote.cted.
There were thousands of free colored people in this country
before the abolition of slavery, enjoying all the essential iights
of life, liberty and property the same as white citizens; yet no
one, at that time, thought that it was any invasion of his
personal status as a freeman because he was not admitted to
all the privileges enjoyed by white citizens, or because he
was subjected to discriminations in the enjoyment of accommodations in inns, public conveyances and places of amusement.
Mere discriminations on account of race or color were not
regarded as badges of slavery. If, since that time, the enjoyment of equal rights in all these respects has become established
by constitutional enactment, it is not by force of the Thirteenth
Amendment (which merely abolishes slavery), but by force of
the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
On the whole we are of opinion, that no countenance of
authority for the passage of the law in question can be found
in either the Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution; and no other ground of authority for its passage
being suggested, it must necessarily be declared void, at least
so far as its operation in the several States is concerned.
This conclusion disposes of the cases now under consideration. In the cases of the United States v. 3ficlhaae Ryan, and
of Ticlzrd A. Robinson and TV~fe v. te .2emplis & Chlrles-

ton Railroad Company, the judgments must be affirmed.
In the other cases, the answer to be given will .be that the first
and second sections of the act of Congress, of March 1st, 1875,
entitled "An Act to protect all citizens in their civil and legal
rights," are unconstitutional and void, and that judgment
should be rendered upon the several indictments in those cases
accordingly.

wxdissenting.

The opinion in these cases proceeds, it seems to me, upon
grounds entirely too narrow and artificial. I cannot resist the
conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and
ingenious verbal criticism.' "It is not the words of the law but
the internal sense of it that makes the law: the letter of the
law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul."
Constitutional provisions, adopted in the interest of liberty,
and for the purpose of securing, through national legislation, if
need be, rights inhering in a state of freedom, and belonging
'to American citizenship, have been so construed as to defeat
the ends the people desired to accomplish, which they
attempted to accomplish, and which they supposed they haa
accomplished by changes in their fundamental law. By this I
do not mean that the determination of these cases should have
been materially controlled by considerations of mere expediency or policy. I mean only, in this form, to express an
earnest conviction that the court has departed from the familiar rule requiring, in the interpretation of constitutional provisions, that full, effect be given to the intent with which they
were adopted.
The purpose of the first section of the at of Congress of
March 1, 1875, was to prevent race discrimination in respect of
the accommodations and facilities of inns, public conveyances,
and places of public amusement. It does not assume to define
the general conditions and limitations under which inns, public
conveyances, and places of public amusement may be conducted, but only declares that such conditions and limitations,
whatever they may be, shall not be applied so as to work a

CIVIL RIGITS CASES.

discrimination solely because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The second section provides a penalty against
any one denying, or aiding or inciting the denial, to any citizen, of that equality of right given by the first section,
except for reasons by law applicable to citizens of every race
or color and regardless of any previous condition of servitude.
There seems to be no substantial difference between my
brethren and myself as to the purpose of Congress; for, they
say that the essence of 'the law is, not to declare broadly that
all persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of
the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of
inns, public conveyances, and theatres; but that such enjoyment shall not be subject to conditions applicable only to
citizens of a particular race or color, or who had been in a previous condition of servitude. The effect of the statute, the
court says, is, that colored citizens, whether formerly slaves or
not, and citizens of other races, shall have the same accommodations and privileges in all inns, public conveyances, and
places of amusement as are enjoyed by white persons; and
vice versa.
The court adjudges, I think erroneously, that Congress
is without power, under either the Thirteenth or Fourteenth
Amendment, to establish such regulations, and that the first
and second sections of the statute are, in all their parts, unconstitutional and void.
Whether the legislative department of the government has
transcended the limits of its constitutional powers, "is at all
times," said this court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cr. 128, "a question of much delicacy, which ought seldom, if ever, to be
decided in the affinmative, in a doubtful case. . . . The
opposition between the Constitution and the law should be
such that the judge feels a clear and strong conviction of their
incompatibility with each other." More recently in Sinking
Funfd CaN6', 99 U. S., 718, we said: "It is our duty when
required in the regular course of judicial proceedings, to
declare an act of Congress void if not within the legislative
power of the United States, but this declar4tion should never
be made except in a clear case. Every possible presumption is

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.

in favor of the validity of a statute, and this continues until
the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch
of the government cannot encroach on the domain of another
without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no
small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule."
Before considering the language and scope of these amendments it will be proper to recall the relations subsisting, prior
to their adoption, between the national government and the
institution of slavery, as indicated by the provisions of the
Constitution, the legislation of Congress, and the decisions
of this court. In this mode we may obtain keys with which
to open the mind of the people, and discover the thought
intended to be expressed.
In section 2 of article IV. of the Constitution it was provided
that "no person held to service or labor in one State, unde
the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence
of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such
service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party
to whom such service or labor may be due." Under the
authority of this clause Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law
of 1793, establishing a mode for the recovery of fugitive
slaves, and prescribing a penalty against any person who should
knowingly and willingly obstruct or hinder the master, his
agent, or attorney, in seizing, arresting, and recovering the
fugitive, or who should rescue the fugitive from him, or who
should harbor or conceal the slave after notice that he was a
fugitive.
In Prigg v. Commowealtk of Penn8ylvania, 16 Pet. 539,
this court had occasion to define the powers and duties of Congress in reference to fugitives from labor. Speaking by Mn.
it laid down these propositions:
. That aSTony
clause of the Constitution conferring a right should
not be so construed as to make it shadowy, or unsubstantial,
or leave the citizen without a remedial power adequate for its
protection, when another construction equally accordant with
the words and the sense in which they were used, would
enforce and protect the right granted;

Dissenting Opinion.

tion of its expressly granted powers; but, for the protection
of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, may employ such
means, not prohibited, as axe necessary and proper, or such as
are appropriate, to attain the ends proposed;
That the Constitution recognized the master's right of property in his fugitive slave, and, as incidental thereto, the right
of seizing and recovering him, regardless of any State lavv, or
regulation, or local custom whatsoever; and,
That the right of the master to have his slave, thus escaping,
delivered up on claim, being guaranteed by the Constitution,
the fair implication was that the national government was
clothed with appropriate authority and functions to enforce it.
The court said: "The fundamental principle, applicable to
all cases of this sort, would seem to be that when the end is
required the means are given, and when the duty is enjoined
the ability to perform it is contemplated to exist on the part of
the functionary to whom it is entrusted." Again: "It would
be a strange anomaly and forced construction to suppose that
the national government meant to rely for the due fulfilment
of its own proper duties, and the rights whibh it intended to
secure, upon State legislation, and not upon that of the Union.
A fortiori,it would be more objectionable to suppose that a
power which was to be the same throughout the Union,
should be confided to State sovereignty which could not rightfully act beyond its own territorial limits."The act of 1793 was, upon these grounds, adjudged to be a
constitutional exercise of the powers of Congress.
It is to be observed from the report of Priggs' case that
Pennsylvania, by her attorney-general, pressed the argument
that the pbligation fo surrender fugitive slaves was on the
States and for the States, subject t6 the restriction that thly
should not pass laws or establish regulations liber tig such
fugitives; that the Constitution did not take from the States
the right to determine the status of all persons within their
respective jurisdictions; that it was for the State in which the
alleged fugitive was found to determine, through her courts or
in such modes as she prescribed,'whether the person arrested
was, in fact, a freeman or a fugitive slave; that the sole power

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.

of the general government in the premises was, by judicial
instrumentality, to restrain and correct, not to forbid and prevent in the absence of hostile State action; and that, for the
general government to assume primary authority to legislate on
the subject of fugitive slaves, to the exclusion of the States,
would be a dangerous encroachment on State sovereignty.
But to such suggestions this court turned a deaf ear, and
adjudged that primary legislation by Congress to enforce the
master's right was authorized by the Constitution.
We next come to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the constitutionality of *hich rested, as did that of 1793, solely upon the
implied power of Congress to enforce the master's rights. The
provisions of that act were far in advance of previous legislation. They placed at the disposal of the master seeking to
recover his fugitive slave, substantially the whole power of
the nation. It invested commissioners, appointed under the
act, with power to summon theposse comitatus for the enforcement of its provisions, and commanded all good citizens to
assist in its prompt and efficient execution whenever their services were requiied as part of the posse comitati. Without
going into the details of that act, it is sufficient to say that
Congress omitted from it nothing which the utmost ingenuity
could suggest as essential to the successful enforcement of the
master's claim to recover his fugitive slave. And this court, in
Ablemanw v. Booth, 21 How. 506, adjudged it to be "in all of
its provisions fully authorized by the Constitution of the
United States."
The only other case, priom to the adoption of the recent
amendments, to which reference will be made, is that of Dred
Scott v. SanforcZ, 19 How. 399. That case was instituted in a
circuit court of the.United States by Dred Scott, claiming to
be a citizen of Missouri, the defendant being a citizen of
another State. Its object was to assert the title of himself
and family to freedom. The defendant pleaded in abatement
that Scott-being of African descent, whose ancestors, of pure
African blood, were brought into this country and sold as
slaves-was not a citizen. The only matter in issue, said the
court, was whether the descendants of slaves thus imported

and sold, when they should be emancipated, or who were born
of parents who had become free before their birth, are citizens
of a State in the sensein which the word "citizen" is used in
the Constitution of the United States.
In determining that question the court.instituted an inquiry
as to who were citizens of the several States at the adoption of
the Constitution, and who, at that time, were recognized as the
people whose rights and liberties had been violated by the
British government. The result was a declaration, by this
court, speaking by Chief J-ustice Taney, that the legislation
and histories of the times, and the language used in the
Declaration of Independence, showed "that neither the class
of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be
included in the general words used in that instrument;" that
"they had for more than a century before been regarded as
beings of an inferior race, and altogether unfit to associate
with the white race, either in social or political relations, and
so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man
was bound to respect, and that the negro might justly and
lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit;" that he was
"bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it;"
and, that "this opinion was at that time fixed and universal in
the civilized portion of the white race. It was regarded as an
axiom in morals as well as in politics, which no one thought of
disputing, or supposed to be open to dispute; and men in
every grade and position in society daily and habitually acted
upon it in their private pursuits, as well as in matters of public
concern, without for a moment doubting the correctness of
this opinion."
The judgment of the court was that the words "people of
the United States" and ".citizens" meant the same thing, both
describing "the political body who, according to our republian institutions, form the sovereignty and hold the power and
conduct the government through their representatives;" that
"they are what we familiarly call the ' sovereign people,' and

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Dissenting Opinion.

every citizen is one of this people and a constituent member of
this sovereignty; " but, that the class of persons described in
the plea in abatement did not compose a portion of this people,
were not "included, and were not intended to be included,
under the word ' citizens' in the Constitution;" that, therefore,
they could "claim none of t6e rights and privileges which that
instrument provides for and secures to citizensof the United
States ;" that, " on the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had
been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had
no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power
and the government might choose to grant them."
Such were the relations'which formerly existed between the
government, whether national or state, and the descendants,
whether free or in bondage, of those of African blood, who
had been imported into this country and sold as slaves.
The first section of the Thirteenth Amendment provides that
"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject
to their jurisdiction." Its second section declares that "Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
legislation." This amendment was followed by the Civil Rights
Act of April 9, 1866, which, among other things, provided that
"all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any
foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby de-"
lared to be citizens of the United States." 14 Stat. 27.
The power of Congress, in this mode, to elevate the enfranchised
race to'national citizenship, was maintained by the supporters
of the act of 1866 to be as full and complete as its power, by
general statute, to make the children, being of full age, of persons naturalized in this country, citizens of the United States
without going through the process of naturalization. The act
of 1866, in this respect, was also likened to that of 1843, in
which Congress declared "that the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, and each and every one of them, shall be deemed to be
and are hereby declared to be, citizens of the United States to

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

all intents and purposes, and shall be entitled to all the rights,
privileges, and immunities of such citizens, and shall in all respects be subject to the laws of the United States." If the act
of 1866 was valid in conferring national citizenship upon all
embraced by its terms, then the colored race, enfranchised by
the Thirteenth Amendment, became citizens of the United
States prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.
But, in the view which I take of the present case, it is not
necessary to examine this question.
The terms of the Thirteenth Amendment are absolute and
universal. They embrace every race which then was, or might
thereafter be, within the United States. No race, as such, can
be excluded from the benefits or rights thereby conferred. Yet,
it is historically true that that amendment was suggested by
the condition, in this country, of that race which had been declared, by this court, to have had-according to the opinion
entertained by the most civilized portion of the white race, at
the time of the adoption of the Constitution-" no rights which
the white man was bound to respect," none of the privileges
or immunities secured by that instrument to citizens of the
United States. It had reference, mn a peculiar sense, to a
people which (although the larger part of them were in slavery) had been invited by an act of Congress to aid in saving
from overthrow a government which, theretofore, by all of its
departments, had treated them as an inferior race, with no
legal rights or privileges except such as the white race might
choose to grant them.
These are the circumstances under which the Thirteenth
Amendment was proposed for adoption. They are now recalled only that we may better understand what was in the
minds of the people when that amendment was considered,
and what were the mischiefs to be remedied and the grievances to be redressed by its adoption.
We have seen that the power of Coligress, by legislation, to
enforce the master's right to have his slave delivered up on
claim was implied from the recognition of that right in the
national Constitution. But the power conferred by the
Thirteenth Amendment does not rest- upon implication or

inference. Those w o framed it were not ignorant of the discussion, covering many years of our country's history, as to the
constitutional power of Congress to enact the Fugitive Slave
Laws of 193 and 1850. When, therefore, it was determined,
by a change in the fundam'ental law, to uproot the institution
of slavery wherever it existed in the land, and to establish
universal freedom, there was a fixed purpose to place the
authority of Congress in the premises beyond the possibility
of a doubt. Therefore, ex indus8ria, power to enforce the
Thirteenth Amendment, by appropriate legislation, was expressly grnted. Legislation for that purpose, my brethren
concede, my be direct and primary. But to what specific ends
* may it be directed? This court has uniformly held that the
national government has the power, whether expressly given or
not, to secure and protect rights conferred or guaranteed by the
Constitution. UnitedStates v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214;- Srauder v.
West lirginia,100 U. S. 303. That doctrine ought not now
to be abaidoned when the inquiry is not as to an implied
power to protect the master's rights, but what may Congress,
under powers expressly granted, do for the protection of freedom and the rights necessarily inhering, in a state of freedom.
* The Thirteenth Amendment, it is conceded, did something
more than to prohibit slavery as an institution,resting upon
distinctions of race, and upheld by positive law. My brethren
admit that it established and decreed universal eivil freedom
throughout the United States. But did the freedom thus
established involve nothing more than exemption from actual
slavery?:, Was nothing more intended than to forbid one man
from owning another as property? Was it the purpose of the
nation simply to destroy the institution, and then remit the
race, theretofore held in bondage, to the several States for such
protection, in their civil rights, necessarily growing out of freedom, as those States, in their discretion, might choose to provide? Were the State's against whose protest the institution
was destroyed, to be left free, so f~r as national interference
was concerned, to make or allow discriminations against that
race, as such, in the enjoyment of those fundamental rights
which by thiversal concession, inhere in a state of freedom?

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

Had the Thirteenth Amendment stopped with the sweeping
declaration, in its first section, against the existence of slavery
and involuntary servitude, except for crime, Congress would
have had the power, by implication, according to the doctrines of
Priggv. Commonwealth of Penn8yvania,repeated in Strauder
v. West Virginia, to protect the freedom established, and consequently, to secure the enjoyment of such civil rights as were
fundamental in freedom. That it can exert its authority to
that extent is made clear, and was intended to be made clear,
by the express grant of power contained in the second section
of the Amendment.
That there are burdens and disabilities which constitute
badges of slavery and servitude, and that the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the Thirteenth Amendment
may be exerted by legislation of a direct and primary character, for the eradication, not simply of the institution, but of
its badges and incidents, are propositions which ought to be
deemed indisputable. They lie at the foundation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866. Whether that act was authorized by the
Thirteenth Amendment alone, without the support which it
subsequently received from the Fourteenth Amendment, after
the adoption of which it was re-enacted with some additions,
my brethren do not consider it necessary to inquire. But I
submit, with all respect to them, that its constitutionality is
conclusively shown by their opinion. They admit, as I have
said, that the Thirteenth Amendment established freedom; that
there are burdens and disabilities, the necessary incidents of
slavery, which constitute its substance and visible form; that
Congress, by the act of 1866, passed in view of the Thirteenth
Amendment, before the Fourteenth was adopted, undertook to
remove certain burdens and disabilities, the necessary incidents
of slavery, and to secure to all citizens of every race and color,
and without regard to previous servitude, those fundamental
rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the
same right to make and enfore contracts, to sue, be parties,
give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, and convey
property as is enjoyed by white citizens; that under the
Thirteenth Amendment, Congress has to do with slavery and

OCTOBER TERM, 1883:

its incidents; and that legislation, so far as necessary or
proper to eradicate all forms and incidents of'slavery gnd involuntary servitude, may -be direct anda primary, operating
upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not. These propositions being conceded, it -is impos.sible, as it seemn, to me, to question the constitutional validity
of the Civil liglits Act of 1866. I do not contend that the
Thirteenth Amendment invests Congress with authority, by
legislation, to define and regulate .the entire body of the civil
rights which citizens enjoy, or may enjoy, in the several States.
,But I hold that- since slavery, as the court has repeatedly declared, S/aughter-houae Caes, 16 Wall. 36; Strauder v. Met
Virginia, 100 1U. S. 303, was the moving or principal cause of
the adoption of that- amendment, and since that institution
rested wholly upon the inferiority, as a race, of those held in
bondage, their freedom necessarilyinvolved immunity fr6m, and
protedtion against, all discrimination against them, because of
their race, in respect of such civil'right as belong to freemen of
other races. Congress, therefore, under its express power to enforce that amendmeAit, by appropriate legislation, may enact
laws to protect that people against the deprivation, becau8e of
thieir race, of 'any civil rights granted to other freemen in the
same State; and such legislation may be of a direct and pyimary
character, operating upon States, their officers and agents, and,
also, upon, at least, such individuals and corporations as exercise public functions and wield power and authority under the
State.
To test .the correctness of this position, let us suppose that,
prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, a State
had passed a statute denying to freemen of African descent,
resident within its limis, the same right which was accorded
to white persons, of making nd enforcing contracts, and of inheriting, purchasing, leasing, selling and conveying property;
or a statute subjecting colored people to severer punishment for
particular offences than was prescribed for white persons, or
excluding that race from the benefit of the laws exempting
homesteads from execution. Recall the legislation of 1865-6
,ugAhtrin some of the States, of which this court, in the

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.

Houe Cae6, said, that it imposed upon the colored race
onerous disabilities and burdens; curtailed their rights in the
pursuit of life, libertj and property to such an extent that their
freedom was of little value; forbade them to appear in the
towns in any other character, than menial servants; required
them to reside on and cultivate the soil, without the right to
purchase or own it; excluded them from many occupations of
gain; and denied them the privilege of giving testimony in'the
courts where a white man was a party. 16 Wall. 57. Can
there be any doubt that all such enactments might have been
reached by direct legislation upon the part of Congress 'under
its express power to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment?
Would any court have hesitated to declare that such legislation
imposed badges of servitude in conflict with the civil freedom
ordained by that amendment? That it would have been also
in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, because inconsistent with the fundamental rights of American citizenship, does
not prove that it would have been consistent with the
Thirteenth Amendment.
What has been said is sufficient to show that the power of
Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment is not necessarily
restricted to legislation against slavery as an institution upheld
by positive law, but may be exerted to the extent, at least, of
protecting the liberated race against discrimination, in respect
of legal rights belonging to freemen, where such discrimination
is based upon race.
It remains now to inquire what are the legal rights of
colored persons in respect of the accommodations, privileges
and facilities of public conveyances, inns and places of public
amusement?
Firdt, as to public conveyances on land and water. In .STew
Jer8ey Skteam .Yavigation Co. v. -erchan'
Bank, 6 How. 344,
this court, speaking by Mr.Justice Nelson, said that a common
carrier is "in the exercise of a sort of public office, and has
public duties to perform, from which he should not be permitted to exonerate himself without the assent of the parties
concerned." To the same effect is 3funn v. Plinoi, 94 U. S.
113. In Olcott v. Supervisor, 16 Wall. 678, it was ruled that

railroads are public Lighways, established by authority of the
State for the public use; that they are none the less public highways, becaused controlled and owned by private corporations;
that itis a part of the function of government-to make and maintain highways for the convenience of the public; that no matter
who is the agent, or what is the agency, the function performed is that of te State; that although the owners may be
private comapanies, they may be compelled to permit the public.
to use these works in the manner in which they can be ivsed;.
that, upon these grounds alone, have the courts sustained the
investiture of railroad corporations with the State's right of
eminent domain, or the right of municipal corporations, under
legislative authority, to assess, levy and collect taxes to aid in
the construction of railroads. So in Town-8hij) of Queemn Ury
v. Culver, 19 Wall. 83, it was said that a municipal subscription
of-railroad stock was in aid of the construction and maintenance
of a public highway, and for the. promotion of a public use.
Again, in Town-slp of Pine Grove v. Talcott, 19 Wall. 666:
"Though the corporation [railroad] was private, its work was
public, as much so as if it were to be constructed by the State."
To the like effect are. numerous adjudications in this and the
State courts with which the profession is familiar. The
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Inhabitantm of
Worcester v. The Wester .R.R. Coaroration,4 Met. 564, said
in reference to a railroad:
%"Theestablishment of that great thoroughfare is regarded
as a public work, established by public authority, intended for
the public use and benefit, the use of which is secured to the
*hole community, and constitutes, therefore, like a canal, turnpike, or highway, a public easement.

.

.

It is true that

the real and personal property, necessary to the establishment
and management of the railroad, is vested in the corporation;
but it is in trust for the public." In Erie,Dtc.,P. 1R. Co. v. Ca8ey,
26 Penn. St. 287, thecourt, referring to an act repealing the charter of a railroad, and under which the State took possession of
the road, said: "It is a public highway, solemnly devoted to
public use. When the lands were taken it was for such use, or
they could not have been taken at all.

tablished upon land taken by the right of eminent domain by
authority of the commonwealth, created by her laws as thoroughfares for commerce, are her highways. No corporation has
property in them, though it njay have franchises annexed to
and exercisable within them."
In many courts it has been held that because of the public
interest in such a corporation the land of a railroad company
cannot be levied on and sold under execution-by a creditor.
The sum of the adjudged cases is that a railroad corporation is
a governmental agency, -created primarily for public purposes,
and subject to be controlled for the public benefit. Upon
this ground the State, when unfettered by contract, may
regulate, in its discretion, the rates of fares of passengers and
freight. And upon this ground, too, the State may regulate
the entire management of railroads in all matters affecting the
convenience and safety of the public; as, for example, by regulating speed, compelling stops of prescribed length at stations,
and prohibiting discriminations and favoritism. If the corporation neglect or refuse to discharge its duties to the public, it
may be coerced to do so by appropriate proceedings in the
name or in behalf of the State.

Such being the relations these corporations hold to the public,
it would seem that the right of a colored person to use an improved public highway, upon the terms accorded to freemen of
other races, is as fundamental, in the state of freedom established in this country, as are any of the rights which my
brethren concede to be so far fundamental as to be deemed the
bssence of civil freedom. "Personal liberty consists," says
Blackstone, "in the power of locomotion, of changing situation,
or removing one's person to whatever places one's own inclination may direct, without restraint, unless by due course of law."
But of what value is this right of locomotion, if it may be
clogged by such burdens as Congress intended by the act of
1875 to remove? They are burdens which lay at the very
foundation of the institution of slavery as it once existed. They
are not to be sustained, except upon the assumption that there
is, in this land of universal liberty, a class which may still
be discriminated against, even in respect of rights bf a character

so necessary and su~eme, that, deprived of their enjoyment
in common with others, a freeman is not only branded as one
inferior and infected, but, in the competitions of life, is robbed
of some of the most essential means of existence; and all this
solely because they belong to a particular race which the nation
has liberated. The Thirteenth Amendment alone obliterated
the race line, so far as all-rights fundamental in a state of freedom are concerned.
Second, as to inns. The same general observations' which
have been made as to railroads are applicable to inns. The
word 'inn' has a lechnical legal signification. It means, in
the act of i875, just what it meant at common law. A mere
private boarding-house is not an inn, nor is its keeper subject
to the responsibilities, or entitled to the privileges of a common
innkeeper. "To constitute one an innkeeper, within the legal
force of that term, he must keep a house of entertainment or
lodging for all travellers or wayfarers who might choose to
accept the same, being of good character or conduct." Redfield
on Carriers, etc., Â§ 575. Says Judge Story:
"An innkeeper may be defined to be the keeper of a common
inn for the lodging and entertainment of travellers and passengers,
thieir -horses and attendants. An innkeeper is bound to take in
all travellers and wayfaring persons, and to entertain them, if he
can accommodate them, for a reasonable compensation ; dnd he
must guard their goods with proper diligence. . .
If an
innkeeper improperly refuses to receive or provide 'for a guest,
he is liable to be indicted therefor. . ...
They (carriers of
passengers) are no more at liberty to refuse a passenger, if they
have sufficient room and accommodations, than an innkeeper is
to refuse suitable room and accommodations to a guest." Story
on Bailments, Â§Â§ 475-6.
In Rex v. Ivens, T Carrington & Payne, 213, 32 E. 0. L.
495, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Coleridge, said:
"An indictment lies against an innkeeper who refuses to
receive a guest, he having at the time, room in his house ;"and
either the price of the guest's entertainment being tendered to
him, or such circumstances occurring as will dispense with that

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

tender. This law is founded in good sense. The innkeeper is
not to select his guests. He has no right to say to one, you shall
come to my inn, and to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself in a proper manner has a right to be
received; and for this purpose innkeepers are a sort of public
servants, they having in return a kind of privilege of entertaining travellers and supplying them with what they want."
These authorities are sufficient to show that a keeper of an
inn is in the exercise of a quasi public employment. The law
gives him special privileges and he is chbtged with certain
duties and responsibilities to the public. The public nature of
his employment forbids him from discriminating against any
person asking admission as a guest on account of the race or
color of that person.
Third. As to places of public amusement. It may be argued
that the managers of such places have no duties to perform
with which the public are, in any legal sense, concerned, or
with which the public have any right to interfere; and, that
the exclusion of a black man from a place of pnblic amusement,
on account of his race, or the denial to him, on that ground, of
equal accommodations at such places, violates no legal right
for the vindication of which he may invoke the aid of the
courts. My answer is, that places of public amusement, within
the meaning of the act of 1875, are such as are established and
maintained under direct license of the law. The authority to
establish and maintain them comes from the public. The colored race is a part of that public. The local government granting the license represents them as well as all other races within
its jurisdiction. A license from the public to establish a place
of public amusement, imports, in law, equality of right, at such
places, among all the members of that public. This must be,
so, unless it be-which I deny-that the common municipal
government of all the people may, in the exertion of its powers,
conferred for the benefit of all, discriminate or authorize discrimination against a particular race, solely because of its former
condition -f servitude.
I also submit, whether it can be said-in view of the doctrines of this court as announced in .funn v. State of linoi8,.

94 U. S. 113, and reaffirmed in Peik v. Chicago & ff. F Railway Co.,94 U. S. 164--that thie management of places of public
amusement is a purely private matter, with which government
has no rightful concern ? In the M unn case the question wats
whether the State of Illinois could fix, by law, the maximum
of charges for the storage of grain in certain warehouses in
that State--theprivaeproverty of iuividuaZ citizen. After
quoting a remark attributed to Lord Chief Justice Hale, to the
effect that when private property is "affected with a public
interest it ceases to be juris.rivationly," the court says:
"Property does become clothed with a public interest when
used in a manner to make it of public consequence and affect the
community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his property
to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants
to the public an interest in that us6, and must submit to be
controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of
the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by
discontinuing the use, but, so long as he maintains the use, he
must submit to the control."
The doctrines of funn v. llinoie havQ never been modified
by this court, and I am justified, upon the authority of that
case, in saying that places of public amusement, conducted
under the authority of the law, are clothed with a public interest, because usid in a manner to make them of public consequence and to affect the community at large. The law may
therefore regulate, to some extent, the mode in which they
shall be conducted, and, consequently, the public have rights
'in respect of such places, which may be vindicated by the law.
It is consequently not a matter purely of private concern.
Congress has not, in these matters, entered the domail of
state control and supervision. It does not, as I have said, assume.to prescribe the general conditions and limitations under
which inns, public conveyances, and places of public amusement,
shall be conducted or managed. It simply declares, in effect,
that since the nation has established universal freedom in this
country, for all time, there shall be no discrimination, based
merely upon race or color, in respect of th6 accommodations

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

and advantages of public conveyances, inns, and places of public
amusement.
I am of the opinion that such discrimination practised by
corporations nd individuals in the exercise of their public or
quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude the imposition of
which Congress may prevent under its power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment; and,
consequently, without reference to its enlarged power under the
Fourteenth Amendment, the act of March 1, 1875) is not, in
my judgment, repugnalht to the Constitution.
It remains now to consider these cases with reference to the
power Congress has possessed since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Much that has been said as to the power
of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment is applicable to
.this branch of the discussion, and will not be repeated.
Before the adoption of the recent amendments, it had become,
as we have seen, the established doctrine of this court that
negroes, whose ancestors had been imported and sold as slaves,
could not become citizens of a State, or even of the United
States, with the rights and privileges guaranteed to citizens by
the national Constitution; further, that one might have all the
rights and privileges of a citizen of a State without being. a citizen in the sense in which that word was used in the national
Constitution, and without being entitled to the privileges and
immu ities of citizens of the several States. Still, further, between the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment and the
proposal by Congress of the Fourteenth Amendment, on June
16, 1866, the statute books of several of the States, as we have
seen, had become loaded down with enactments which, under
the guise of Apprentice, Vagrant, and Contract regulations,
sought to keep the colored race in a condition, practically, of
servitude. It was openly announced that whatever might be
the rights which persons of that race had, as freemen, under the
guarantees of the natioal Constitution, they could not become
citizens of a State, with the privileges belonging to qitizens, except by the consent of such State; consequently, that their ciyil
rights, as citizens of the State, depended entirely upon State
legislation. To meet this new peril to the black race, that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.

purposes of the nation might not be doubted or defeated, and
by way of further enlargementl of the power of Congress, the
Fourteenth Amendment was proposed f6r adoption.
Remembering that this court, in the Slaught&r-fowe Caqee,
declared that the one pervading purpose found in all the recent
amendments, lying at the foundation of. each, and without
which none of them would have been suggested-was "the
freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of
that freedom, and the protection of the newly-made freeman
and citizen from the oppression of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him "-that each amendment
was addressed primarily to the grievances of that race-let us
proceed to consider the language of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Its first and fifth sections are in these words:
"1SEc. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States,
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, arp citizens 6f the United
States and of the State'wherein they reside. â€¢No State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.

"SEc. 5. That Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."
It was adjudged in Strauderv. ]Yet ]Firginia,100 U.S. 303,
and ~.~~parie irgini, .100 U. S. 399, and iy brethren con
cede, that positive rights aVLd privileges were intended to be
secured, and are in facesecured, by the Fourteenth Amendment.
But when, under what circumstances, and: to what extent,
may Congress, by means of legislation, exert its power to enforce the provisions of this amendment? The theory of the
opinion of the majority of the court-the foundation upon
whicli their reasoning seems to rest--is, that the general government cannot, in a4vance of hostile State laws or hostile State

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

proceedings, actively interfere for the protection of any of the
rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Fourteenth
Amendment. It is said that such rights, privileges, and immunities are secured by way of proihition.against State laws and
State proceedings affecting such rights and privileges, and by
power given to Congress to legislate for the purpose of carrying such proibitioninto effect; also, that congressional legislation must necessarily be predicated upon such supposed State
laws or State proceedings, and be directed to the correction of
their operation and effect.
In illustration of its position, the court refers to the clause of
the Constitution forbidding the passage by a State of any law
impairing the obligation of contrdcts. That, clause does not, I
submit, furnish a proper illustration of the scope and effect of
the fifth section of the Fourteenth Amendment. No express
power is given Congress to enforce, by primary direct legislation, the prohibition upon State laws impairing the obligation
of contracts. Authority is, indeed, conferred to enact all
necessary and proper laws for carrying into execution the enu-,
merated powers of Congress and all other powers vested by the
Constitution in the government of the United States or in any
department or officer thereof. And, as heretofore shown, there
is also, by necessary implication, power in Congress, by legislation, to protect a right derived from the national Constitution.
But a prohibition upon a State is not aprower in Congress or in
Mhe national government. It is simply a denial of power to the
State. And the only mode in which the inhibition upon State
laws impairing the obligation of contracts can be enforced, is,
indirectly, through the courts, in suits where the parties raise
some question as to the constitutional validity of such laws.
The judicial power of the United States extends to such suits
for the reason that they are suits arising under the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment presents' the first instance
in our history of the investiture of Congress .with affirmative
power, by legislation,to enforce an express "prohibition upon
the States. It is not said that the judiciia power of the nation
may be exerted for the enforcement of that amendment. No
enlargement of the judicial power was required, for it is clear

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.

that had the fifh section of the Fourteenth Amendment been
entirely omitted; the judiciary -could have stricken down all
State laws and nullified all State proceedings in hostility to
rights and privileges secured or recognized by that amendment.
The power given is, in terms, by congressional legi8ai n, to
enforce the provisions of the amendment.
The assumption that this amendment consists wholly of prohibitions upon State laws and State proceedings in hostility to
its provisions, is unauthorized by its language. The first clause
of the first section-" All -persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the State wherein they reside"
-is of a distinctly affirmative character. In its application to
the colored race, previously liberated, it created and granted,
as well citizenship of the United States, as citizenship of the
State in which they respectively resided. It introduced all of
that race, whose ancestors had been imported and sold as slaves,
at bnce, into the political community known as the "People of
the United States." They became, instantly, citizens of the
United States, and of their respective States. Further, they
were brought, by this supreme act df the nation, within the
direct operation of that provision of the Constitution which declares that "the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States." Art.
The citizenship thus acquired, by that race, in virtue of an
affirmative grant from the nation, inay be protected, not alone by
the judicial branch of the"government, but by congressional
legislation of a primary direct character; this, because the
power of Congress is not restricted to the enforcement of prohibitions upon State laws or State action. It is, in terms distinct and positive, to enforce "the provi8iow of ti8 artioZe" of
amendment; not simply those of a prohibitive character, but
the provisions -- zl of tile provisions-affirmative and prohibitive, of the amendment. It is, therefore, a grave misconception to suppose that the fifth section of the amendment has
reference exclusively to express prohibitions upon State laws or
State action. If any right was created by that amendment, the

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

grant of power, through appropriate legislation, to enforce its
provisions, authorizes Congress, by means of legislation, operating throughout the entire Union, to guard, secure, and protect
that right.
It is, therefore, an essential inquiry what, if any, right, privi-.
lege or immunity was given, by the nation, to colored persons,
when they were made citizens of the State in which they reside?
Did the constitutional grant of State citizenship to that race,
of its own force, invest them with any rights, privileges and immunities whatever? That they became entitled, upon the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, "to all privileges and inmmunities of citizens in the several States," within the meaning
of section 2 of article 4 of the Constitutioli, no one, I suppose,
will for a moment question. Whit are the privileges and- immunities to which, by that clause of the Constitution, they
became entitled? To this it may be answered, generally, upon
the authority of the adjudged cases, that they are those which
are fundamental in citizenship in a free republican government,
such as are "common to the citizens in the latter States under
their constitutions and laws by virtue of their being citizens." Of
that provision it has been said, with.the approval of this court,
that no other one in the Constitution has tended so strongly to
constitute the citizens of the United States one people. Ward

Although this court has wisely forborne any attempt, by a
comprehensive definition, to indicate all of the privileges and immunities to which the citizen of a State is entitled, of right, when
within the jurisdiction of other States, I hazard nothing, in vieW
of former adjudications, in saying thAt no State can sustain her
denial to colored citizens of other States, while within her limits;
of privileges or immunities, fundamental in republicapu citizenship, upon the ground that she accords such privileges and
immanities only to her white citizens and withholds them from
her colored citizens. Tht colored citizens of other States, within
the jurisdiction of that State, could claim, in virtue of section
2 of article 4 of the Constitution, every privilege and immunity

which that State secures to her white citizens. Otherwise, it
would be in the\ power of any State, by discriminating class
legislation against its own citizens of a particular race or color,
to withhold from citizens of other States, belonging to that
proscribed race, when within her limits, privileges and immunities of the character regarded by all courts as fundamental in
citizenship; and that, too, when the constitutional guaranty is
that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to "all privileges
and immunities of citizens of the several States." No State
may, by discrimination against a portion of its own citizens of
a particular race, in respect of privileges and immunities fundamental in citizenship, impair the constitutional right of citizens
of other States, of whatever race, to enjoy in that State all such
privileges and immunities as are there accorded to her most
favored citizens. A colored citizen of Ohio or Indiana, while
in the jurisdiction of Tennessee, is entitled to enjoy any privilege or immunity, fundamental in citizenship, which is given to
citizens of the white race in the latter State. It is not to be
supposed that any one will controvert this proposition.
But what was secured to colored citizens of the United States
-as between them and their respective States-by the national
grant to them of State citizenship? With what rights, privileges, or immunities did this grant invest them? There is one,
if there be no other-exemption from race discrimination in
respect of any civil right belonging to citizens of the white race
in the same State. That, surely, is their constitutionalprivilege
when within the jurisdiction of other States. And such must
be their constitutional right, in their own State, unless the recent
amendments be splendid baubles, thrown out to delude those
who deserved fair and generous treatment at the hands of the
nation. Citizenship in this country necessarily imports at least
equality of civil rights among citizens of every race in the same
State. It is fundamental in American citizenship that, in
respect of such rights, there shall be no discrimination by the
State, or its officers, or by individuals or corporations' exercising
public functions or authority, against any citizen because of his
race or previous condition of servitude. In United State8 v.
C5uiks/ank, 92 U. S.542, it was said at page 555, that the

rights of life and personal liberty are natural rights of man,
and that "the equality of the rights of citizens is a principle of
republicanism." And in Ex parte 7'irginia, 100 U. S. 334,
the emphatic language of this court is that "one great purpose
of these amendments was to raise the colored race from that
condition of inferiority and servitude in which most of them
had previously stood, into perfect equality of civil rights withn
all other persons within the jurisdiction of the States." So, in
Strauder v. Test 'irginia, 100 U. S. 306, the court, alluding to
the Fourteenth Amendment, said: "This is one of a series of
constitutional provisions having a common purpose, namely,
securing to a race recently emancipated, a race that through
many generations had been held in slavery, all the civil rights
that the superior race enjoy." Again, in .Teal v. -)elaware,
103 U. S. 386, it was ruled that this amendment was designed,
primarily, "to secure to the colored race, thereby invested with
the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of citizenship, the enjoyment of all the civil rights that, under the law, are enjoyed
by white persons."
The language of this court with reference to the Fifteenth
Amendment, adds to the force of this view. In United States
v. Cruikshank, it was said: "In United States v. Reese, 92
U. S. 214, we held that the Fifteenth Amendment has invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right, which is exemption from discrimination in the
exercise of the elective franchise, on account of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude. From this it appears that the
right of suffrage is. not a necessary attribute of national citizenship, but that exemption from discrimination in the exercise of
that right on account of race, &c., is. The right to vote in the
States comes from the States; but the right of exemption from
the prohibited discrimination comes from the United States.
The first has not been granted or secured by the Constitution
of the United States, but the last has been."
Here, in language at once clear and forcible, is stated the
principle for which I contend. It can scarcely be claimed that
exemption from race discrimination, in respect of civil rights,
against those to whom State citizenship was granted by the

nation, is any less, for the colored race, a new constitutional
right, derived from and secured by the national Constitution,
than is exemption from such discrimination in the exercise of
the elective franchise. It cannot be'that the latter is an attribute of national citizenship, while the other is not essential in
national citizenship, or fundamental in State citizenship.
If, then, exemption from discrimination, in respect of civil
rights, is a new constitutional right, secured by the grant of
State citizenship to colored citizens of the United States-and
I do not see how this can now be questioned-why may not the
nation, by means of its own legislation of a primary direct
character, guard, protect and enforce that right? It is a right
and privilege which the nation conferred. It did not come
from the States in which those colored citizens reside. It has
been the established doctrine of this court-during all its history,
accepted as essential to the natiofial supremacy, that Congress,
in the absence of a positive delegation of power to the State
legislatures, may, by its own legislation, enforce and protect any
right derived-from or created by the national Constitution. It
was so declared in Priggv. Commonwealtk of Penn8ylvania. It
was reiterated in Urnited States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, where
the court said that "rights and immunities created by and
dependent upon the Constitution of the United States can be
protected by Congress. The form and manner of the protection may be such as (ongress, in the legitimate exercise of its
discretion, shall provide. These may be varied to meet the
necessities of the particular right to be protected." It was distinctly reafirmed in Strauder v. TVe8t Tirginia,100 U. S. 310,
where we said that "a right or immunity created by the Constitution or only guaranteed by it, even without any express
delegation of power, may be protected by Congress." How
then can it be claimed in view of the declarations of this court in
former dases, that exemption of colored citizens, Within their
States, from race discrimination, in respect of the civil rights of
citizens, is not an immunity created or derived from the national
Constitution?
This court has always given a broad and liberal construction
to the Constitution, so as to enable Congress, by legislation, to

enforce rights secured by that instrument. The legislation
which Congress may enact, in execution of its power to enforce
the provisibns of this amendment, is such as may be appropriate t6 protect the right granted. The word appropriate was
undoixbtedly used with reference to its meaning, as established
by repeated decisions of this court. Under given circumstances,
that which the' court characterizes as corrective legislation
might be deemed by Congress appropriate and entirely sufficient. Under other circumstances primary direct legislation
may be required. But it is for Congress, not the judiciary, to
say that legislation is appropriate-that .is-best adapted to
the end to be attained. The judiciary may not, with safety to
our institutions, enter the domain of legislative discretion, and
dictate the means which Congress shall employ in the exercise
of its granted powers. That would be sheer usurpation of
the factions of a co-ordinate department, which, if often
repeated, and permanently acquiesced in, would work a radical change in our system of government. In United States
v. Fisher, 2 Cr. 358, the court said that "Congress must
possess the choice of means, and must be empowered to
use any means which are in fact conducive to the exercise
of a power granted by the Constitution." "The sound construction of the Constitution," said Chief Justice Marshall,
"must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with
respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be
carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform
the high duties assigned to it in the manner most beneficial to
the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the
scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,
but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are
constitutional." ZfroCulkoc v. -Harylanu, 4 Wh. 421.
Must these rules of construction be now abandoned? Are
the powers of the national legislature to be restrained in proportion as the rights and privileges, derived from the nation,
are valuable? -Are constitutional provisions, enacted to secure
the dearest rights of freemen and citizens, to be subjected to

which requires that the word to be interpreted must be taken
mosts'trongly against those who employ them ? Or, shall it be
remembered that "a constitution of government, founded by
the people for themselves and their posterity, and for objects
of the most momentous nature-for perpetual union, or the
establishment of justice, for the general welfare, and for a perpetuation of the blessings of liberty-necessarily requires that
every interpretation of its powers should have a constant reference to these objects? No interpretation of the words in which
those powers are granted cdn be a sound one, which narrows
down their ordinary import so as to defeat those objects." 1
Story Const. Â§ 422.
The opinion of the court, as I.have said, proceeds upon the
ground that the power of Congress to legislate for the protection' of the rights and privileges secured by the Fourteenth
Amendment cannot be brought into activity except with the
view, and as it may become necessary, to correct and annul
State lawÂ§ and State proceedings in hostility to such rights and
privileges. In the absence of State laws or State action adverse
to such rights and privileges, the nation may not actively interfere for their protection and security, even against corporations
and .individuals exercising public or quasi public functions.
Such I understand to be the position of my btethinen. If the
grant to colored citizens of the United States of citizenship in
their respective States, imports exemption from race discrimination, in their States, in respect of such civil rights as belong to
citizenship, then; to hold that the amendment remits that right
to the States for their protection, primarily, and stays the hands
of the nation, until it is assailed by State laws or State proceedings, is to adjudge that the amendment, so far from enlarging
the powers of Congress-as we have heretofore said it didnot only curtails them, but reverses the policy which the
general government has'pursued from its very organization.
Such an interpretati6n of the amendment is a denial to Congress of the power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce one
of its provisions. In view of the circumstances under which
the recent amendments were incorporated into the Constitution,
and especially in view of the peculiar character of the new

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

rights they created and secured, it ought not to be presumed
that the general government has abdicated its authority, by
national legislation, direct and primary in its character, to
guaid and protect privileges and immunities secured by that
instrument. Such an interpretation of the Constitution 6ught
not to be accepted if it be possible to avoid it. Its acceptance
would lead to this anomalous result: that whereas, prior to the
amendments, Congress, with the sanction of this court, passed
the most stringent lawsr-operating directly and primarily upon
States and their officers and agents, as well as upon individuals
-in vindication of slavery and the right of the master, it noa~r
not now, by legislation of a like primary and direct character,
guard, protect, and secure the freedom established, and the
most essential right of the citizenship granted, by the constitutional amendments. With all respect for the opinion of others,
I insist that the national legislature may, without transcending
the limits of the Constitution, do for human liberty and the
fundamental rights of American citizenship, what it did, with
the sanction of this court, for the protection of slavery and the
rights of the masters of fugitive slaves. If fugitive slave laws,
providing modes and prescribing penalties, whereby the master
could seize and recover his fugitive slave, were legitimate exercises'of an implied power to protect and enforce a right
recognized by the Constitution, why shall the hands of Congress be tied, so that-under an express power, by appropriate
legislation, to enforce a constitutional provision granting citizenship-it may not, by means of direct legislation, bring the
whole power of this nation to bear upon States and their officers, and upon such individuals and corporations exercising
public functions as assume to abridge, impair, or deny rights
confessedly secured by the supreme law of the land?
It does not seem to me that the fact that, by the second
clause of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
States are expressly prohibited from making or enforcing laws
abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States, furnishes any sufficient reason for holding or
maintaining that the amendment was intended to deny Congress the power, by general, primary, and direct legislation, of

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Dissenting Opinion.

protecting citizens of the several States, beinq also citizens of
the United States, against all discrimination, in respect of their
rights as citizens, which is founded on race, color, or previous
condition of 'servitude.
Such an interpretation of the amendment is plainly repugnant to its fifth section, conferring upon Congress power, by
appropriate legislation, to enforce not merely the provisions
containing prohibitions upon the States,.but all of the provisions
of the amendment, including the provisions, express and implied, in the first clause of the first section of the article
granting citizenship. This alone is sufficient for holding that
Congress is not restricted to the enactment of laws adapted to
counteract and redress the operation of State legislation, or the
action of State officers, of the character prohibited by the
amendment. It was perfectly well known thaT the great
danger to the equal enjoyment by citizens of their rights, as
citizens, was to be apprehended not altogether from unfriendly
State legislation, but from the hostile action of corporations
and individuals m the States. And it is to be presumed that it
was intended, by that section, to clothe Congress with power
and authority to meet that danger. If the rights intended to
be secured by the act of 1875 are such .as belong to the citizen,
in common or equally with other citizens in the same State, then
it is not to be denied that such legislation is peculiarly appropriate to the end which Congress is authorized to accomplish, viz., to
protect the citizen, in respect of such rights, against discrimina,tion on account of his race. Recurring to the specific prohibition
in the Fourteehth Amendment upon the making or enforcing
,of Stale laws abridging the privileges of citizens of the United
.States, I remark that if, as held in the Slaughter-Houe Ca eg, the
privileges here referred to were those which belonged to citizen,ship of the United States, as distinguished from those belonging
to State citizenship, it was impossible for any State prior to the
adoption, of that amendment to have enforced laws of that
character. The judiciary could have annulled all such legislation under the provision that the Constitution shall be the
supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws
of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. The Stateswere

already under an implied prphibition not to abridge any
privilege or immunity belonging to citizens of the United
States as such. Consequently, the prohibition upon State laws
in h6stility to rights belonging to citizens of the United States,
whs intended-in view of the' introduction into the body of.
citizens of a race formerly denied the essential rights of
citizenship-only as an express limitation on the powers of
the States, and was not intended to diminish, in the slightest
degree, the authority which1 the nation has always exercised, of
protecting, by means of its own direct legislation, rights created
or secured by the Constitution. Any purpose to diminish the
national. authority in iespect of privileges derived from the
nation is distinctly negatived by the express grant of power, by
legislation, to enforce every provision of the amendment, including that which, by the grant of citizenship in the State, secures
exemption from race discrimination in respect of the civil rights
of citizens.
It is said that any ihterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment different from that adopted by the majority of the court,
would imply that Congress had authority to enact a municipal
code for all the States, covering every matter affecting the life,
liberty, and property of the citizens of the several. States. Not
so. Prior to the adoption of that amendment the constitutions
of the several*States, without perhaps an exception, secured all
person8 against deprivation of life, liberty, or property, otherwise than by due process of law, and, in some form, recognized
the right of all per8ma to the equal protection of the laws.
Those rights, therefore, existed before that amendment was
proposed or adopted, and .were not created by it. If, by reason
of that fact, it be assumed that protection in these rights of
persons still rests primarily with the States, and that Congress
may not interfere except to enforce, by means of corrective
legislation, the prohibitions upon State laws or State proceedings inconsistent with those rights,.it does not at all follow,
that privileges which have been granted by the vation, may not
be protected by primary legislation upon the part of Congress.
The personal rights and immunities recognized in the prohibitive clauses of the amendment were, prior to its adoption,

under the protection, primarily, of the States, while rights,
created by or derived from the United States, have always
been, and, in the nature of things, should always be, primarily,
underthe protection of the general government. Exemption
from race discrimination in respect of the civil rights which
axe fundamental in citizenmk'ip in a republican government,
is, as we have seen, a new right, created by the nation,
with express power in Congress, by legislation, to enforce the
constitutional provision from which it is derived. If, in some
sense, such race discrimination is, within the letter of the last
clause of the first section, a denial of that equal protection of
the laws which is secured against State denial to all persons,
whether citizens or not, it cannot be possible that a mere prohibition upon such State denial, or a prohibition upon State
laws abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States, takes from the nation the power which it has
uniformly exercised of protecting, by direct primary legislation, those privileges and immunities which existed under the
Constitution before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, or have been created by that amendment in behalf of
those thereby made citize= of their respective States,
This construction does not in any degree intrench upon the
just rights of the States in the control of their domestic affairs.
It simply recognizes the enlarged powers conferred by the
recent amendments upon the general government. In the view
which I take of those amendments, the States possess the same
authority which they have always had to define and regulate
the civil rights which their own people, in virtue of State citizenship, may enjoy within their respective limits; except that
its exercise is now subject to the expressly granted power of
Congress, by legislation, to enforce the provisions of such
amendments-a power which necessarily carries with it authority, by national legislation, to protect and secure the privileges
and immunities which are created by or are derived from those
amendments. That exemption of citizens from discrnmination
based on race or color, in respect of civil rights, is one of those
privileges or immunities, can no longer be deemed an open
question in this court.

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES.
Dissenting Opinion.

It was said of the case of -Dred8cottv. Sandford,that thi court,
there overruled the action of two generations, virtually inserted
a new clause in the Constitution, changed its character, and
made a new departure-n the. workings of the federal government. I may be permitted to say that if the recent amendments are so construed that Congress may not, in its own
discretion, aid independently of the action or non-action
of the Stateg, provide, by legislation of a direct character,
for the security of rights created by the national Constitution; if it be adjudged that the obligation to protect the
fundamental privilegeq and immunities granted by the Four*teenth Amendment to citizens residing in the several States,
rests primarily, not on the nation, but on the States; if it be
further adjudged that individuals and corporations, exercising
public functions, or wielding power under public authority, may, without liability to direct primary legislation on
the part of Congress, make the race of. citizens the ground
for denying them that equality of civil rights which the
Constitution ordains as a principle of republican citizenship;
then, not only the foundations upon which the national supremacy has always securely rested will be materially disturbed,
but we shall enter upon an era of constitutional law, when the
rights of freedom and American citizenship cannot receive from
the nation that efficient protection which heretofore was unhesitatingly accorded to slavery and the rights of the master.
But if it were conceded that the power of Congress could
not be brought into activity until the rights specified in the act
of 1875 had been abridged or denied by some State law or State
action, I maintain that the decision of the -court is erroneous.
There has been adverse State action within the Fourteenth
Amendment as heretofore interpreted by this court. I allude
to ExLparte lirginia, upra. It appears, in that case, that
one Cole, judge of a county court, was charged with the duty,
by the laws of Virginia, of selecting grand and petit jurors.
The law ot the State did not authorize or permit him, in making such selections; to discriminate against colored citizens
because of their, race. But he, was indicted in the federal
court, under the act of 1875, for maling such discriminations.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Dissenting Opinion..

The attorney-general of Virginia contended before us, that the
State had done its duty, and had not authorized or directed that
county judge to do what he was chargd with having done;
that the State had not denied to the colored race the equal
protection of the laws; and that consequently the act of Cole
must be deemed his individual act, in contravention of the
will of the State. Plausible as this argument was, it failed to
convince this court, and after saying that the Fourteenth
Amendment had reference to the political body denominated a
State, "by whatever instruments br in whatever modes that
action may be taken," and that a State acts by its legislative,
executive, and judicial authorities, and can act in no other way,
we proceeded:
"The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no
agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its
powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdictioAi the equal protection of the laws. *Whoever, by virtue of
public position under a State government, deprives another of
property, life, or liberty without due process of law, or denies or
takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition ; and, as he acts under the name and for the
State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the
State. This must be so, or the constitutional prohibition has no
meaning. Then the State has clothed one of its agents with
power to annul or evade it. But the constitutional amendment
was ordained for a purpose. It was to secure equal rights to all
persons, and, to insure to all persons the enjoyment of such
rights, power was given to Congress to enforce its provisions by
appropriate legislation. Such legislation must act upon persons,
not upon the abstract thing denominated a State, but upon the
persons who are the agents of the State, in the denial of the rights

duties to the public, and are amenable, in respect of their duties
and functions, to governmental regulation. It seems to me that,
within the wrinciple settled in Ex a rte F gini, a denial, by
these instrumentalities of the State, to the citizen, because of
his race, of that equality of civil rights secured, to him by law,
is a denial by the State, within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment.. If it be not, then that race is left, inrespect of the
civil rights in question, practically at the mercy of corporations
and individuals wielding power under the States.
But the court says that Congress did not, in. the act of 1866,
assume, under the authority given by the Thirteenth Amendment, to adjust what may be called the social rights of men
and races in the community. I agree that government has
nothing to do with social, as distinguished from technically
legal, rights of individuals. No. government ever has brought,
or ever can bring, its people into social intercourse against
their wishes. Whether one person will permit or maintain
social relations with another is a matter with which government has no concern. I agree that if one citizen chooses not
to hold social intercourse with another, he is not and cannot be
made amenable to the law for his conduct in that regard; for
even upon grounds of race, no legal right of a citizen is violated
by the refusal of others to maintain merely social relations with
him. What I affirm is that no State, nor the officers of any
State, nor any corporation or individual wielding power under
State authority for the public benefit or the public convenience,
can, consistently either with the freedom established by the
fundamental law, or with that equality of civil rights which
now belongs to every citizen, discriminate against freemen or,
citizens, in those rights, because of their race, or b~cause they
once labored under the disabilities of slavery imposed upon them
as a race. The rights which Congress, by the act of 1875, endeavored to secure and protect are legal, not social rights. The
right, for instance, of a colored citizen to use the accommodations of a public highway, upon the same terms as are permitted
to white citizens, is'no more a social right than his right, under
the law, to use the public streets of a city or a town, or a turnpike road, or a public market, or a post o~ce, or his right to sit

in a public building with others, of whatever race, for the purpose of hearing the political questions of the day discussed.
Scarcely a day passes without our seeing in this court-room
citizens of the white and black races sitting side by side, watching the progress of our business. It would never occur to any
one that the presence of a colored citizen in a court-house, or
court-room, was an invasion of the social rights of white persons who -mayfrequent such places. And yet, such a suggestion would be quite as sound in law-I say it with all respectas is the suggestion that the claim of a colored citizen to use,
upon the same terms as is permitted to white citizens, the accommodations of public highways, or public inns, or places of
public amusement, established under the license of the law, is
an invasion of the social rights of.the white race.
The court, in its opinion, reserves the question whether Congress, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce amongst
the several States, might or might not pass a law regulating
rights in public conveyances passing from one State to another.
I beg to suggest that that precise question was substantially
presented here in the only one of these cases r flating to railroadsoblinson and TFife v. .emphis c ChurletonRailroad
Companyi. In that case it appears that Mrs. Robinson, a citizen of Mississippi, purchased a railroad ticket entitling her to
be carried from Grand Junction, Tennessee, to Lynchburg,
Virginia. Might not the act of 18T5 be maintained in that
case, as applicable at least to commerce between the States,
notwithstanding it does not, upon its face, profess to have been
passed in pursuance of the power of Congress to regulate commerce? Has it ever been held that the judiciary should overturn a statute, because the legislative department did not
accurately recite therein the particular provision of the Constitution authorizing its enactment? We have often enforced
municipal bonds in aid of railroad subscriptions, where they
failed to recite the statute authorizing their issue, but recited
one which did not sustain their validity. The inquiry in such
cases has been, was there, in any statute, authority for the execution of the bonds? Upon this branch of the case, it may be
remarked that the State of Louisiana, in 1869, passed a statute

giving to passengers, without regard to race or color, equality
of right in the accommodations of railroad and street cars,
steamboats or other water crafts, stage coaches, omnibuses, or
other vehiclei. But inlladl v. De Cuir, 95 U. S. 481, that act
was pronounced unconstitutional so far as it related to commerce between the States, this court saying that "if the public
good requires such legislation it must come from Congress, and
not from the States." I suggest, that it may become a pertinent inquiry whether Congress may, in the exertion of its
power to regulate commerce among the States, enforce among
passengers on public donveyances, equaiity of right, without
regard to race, color or previous condition of servitude, if it be
true-which I do not admit-that such legislation would be
an interference by government with the social rights of the
people.
My brethren say, that when a man has emerged from slavery,
and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that state, there must be some stage
in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a
mere citizen, and ceases to'be the special favorite of the laws,
and when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected
in the ordinary modes by which other men's rights are pro
tected. It is, I submit, scarcely just to say that the colored
race has been the special favorite of the laws. The statute of
1875i now adjudged to be unconstitutional, is for the benefit of citizens of every' race and color. What the nation,
through Congress, has sought to accomplish in reference to that
race, is--what had already been done in every State of the
Union for the white race-to secure and protect rights belonging to them as freemen and citizens; nothing more. It was
not deemed enough "to help the feeble up, but to support
him after." The one underlying purpose of congressional legislation has been to enable the black race to take the rank of
mere citizens. The difficulty has been to compel a recognition of the legal right of the black race to take the rank
of citizens, and to secure the enjoyment of privileges belonging, under the law, to them as a component part of the
people for whose welfare and happiness government is ordained.

At every step, in this direction, the nation has been confronted
with class tyranny, which a contemporary English historian
says is, of all tyrannies, the most intolerable, "for it is ubiquitous in its operation, and weighs, perhapg, most heavily on those
whose obscurity or distance would withdraw them from the
notice of a single despot." To-day, it is the colored race which
is denied, by corporations and individuals wielding public authority, rights fundamental in their freedom and citizenship. At
some future time, it may be tha; some other race will fall under
the ban of race discrinination. If the constitutional amendments
be enforced, according to the intent with which, as I conceive,
.they were. adopted, there cannot be, in this republic, any class
of human beings in practical subjection to another class, with
power in the latter to dole out to the foriner just such privileges
as they may-choose to grant. The supreme law of the land has
decreed that no authority shall be exercised in this country
ul on the basis of discrimination, in respect of civil rights,
against freemen and citizens because of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude. To that decree--for the due
enforcement of which, by appropriate legislation, Congress has
been invested with express power-every one must bow, what
ever may have been, or whatever now are, his individual views
as to the wisdom or policy, either of the recent changes in the
fundamental law, or of the legislation which has been enacted
to give them effect.
For the reasons stated I feel constrained to withhold my
assent to the opinion of the court.
