Conflict of Laws-Contitutional Law-Damages-Eminenl Domain-State

Courts.
1. The power to take private property for public uses, in 'the exercise of the
right of eminent domain, is an incident of sovereignty, belonging to every
independent government, and requiring no constitutional recognition,
and it exists in the government of the United States. Boom v..Patterson,
98 U. S. 406, cited and approved.
2. The liability to make compensation 'for private property taken for public
uses is a constitutional limitation of the right -of eminent domain. As
this limitation forms no part of the power to take private property for
public uses, the government of the United States may delegate to a tribunal created under the laws of a State, the power to fix and determine
the amount of compensation to be paid by the United States for private
property taken by them in the exercise of their right of eminent domain ;
or it may, if it pleases, create a special tribunal for that purpose. On
this point Kohl v. United ,Sates,91 U. S. 367, cited and approved.

MR. JUSTICE. FIn delivered the opinion of the court.
By an act of Congress passed on the 8th of Agust, 1846,
certain lands were ceded to Wisconsin to aid in improving the
navigation of Fox and Wisconsin rivers, in that State, and in
constructing a canal to unite the rivers, and thus form a connection between the waters of Green Bay, in LAke fMiehigan,
and the waters of the Mississippi. 9 Stat. 83, ch. 170.
The State accepted the cession of the lands, and in August,
1848, created a board of public works, under whose superintendence it placed the construction of the improvement contemplated. The work, however, was not done under that
board ; the means furnished proved inadequate. Various other
attempts, therefore, were made by different companies created
by the State to carry out the improvement, and in furtherance
of it Congress ceded additional lands; but none of these atVoL. cix--33

tempts proved successful. The improvement was only partially
made.
In 1866, byvarious transfers, which it is unnecessary to
detail, -the lands ceded by Congress, and the works of improvement, -including the locks, dams, canals, and other structures
connected with it, became the property of a corporation known
as the Green Bay and Mississippi Canal Company.
In July, 1870, Congress passed an act "for the improvement
of water communication between the Mississippi River and
Lake -Michigan by the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers;" by which,
among other things, the secretary of war was authorized to ascertain the sum which ought to be paid to the Green Bay and
Mississippi Canal Company for the transfer of its property and
rights of property in the line of water communication between
Wisconsin River and the mouth of Fox River, including its
locks, dams, canals, and franchises, or so much thereof as, in
his judgment, should be needed; and for that purpose to join
with the company in the appointment of a board of arbitrators.
In making their award. the arbitrators were required to take
into consideration the amount of money obtained from the sale
of lands ceded by Congress to aid in the construction of the
water communication, which was to be deducted from the valuation found by them. 16 Stat. 189, ch. 210.
Under this act arbitrators were appointed, the value of the
works ascertained, nd an award made, the amount of which
having been paid, the entire property was, in 1872, conveyed
' to the United States. Since then the United States have been
the owners and in possession of the works, and Congress has
made various appropriations to carry on and complete the improvement.
The arbitrators, in making their award, proceeded upon the
principle that the United States should pay for the works what
their construction had cost the State, and the companies succeeding to its interests, after making a reasonable abatement
for wear and decay, and deducting the amount obtained from
the sale of the ceded lands. Some of the dams constructed had
daused the lands of several parties to be overflowed, and in the
estimate of th;e amount to be paid by the United States no ac-

count was.taken of the liability pf the company for such damages. The question, therefore, soon arose whether the payment
oT these damages devolved upon the United States ; and this
question was submitted by the committee on commerce of the
House of Representatives to the secretary of war, and by him
was referred to the assistant judge advocate-general. That
officer held that liability for the damages incurred from the
flowage of water on the lands of others, caused by the works
constructed, followed the property transferred, and devolved on
the United States. Upon this opinion a bill was" prepared for
the assumption by them of the company's liability for such
damages, which was passed by -Congress and approved on the.
3d of March, 1875. This act provided that whenever, in the
prosecution and maintenance of the improvement mentioned, it
should become necessary or proper, in the judgment of the secretary of war, to take possession of any lands, or the right of
way over any lands, for canals or cut-offs, or to use any earth,
quarries, or other material adjacent to the line of improvement
and needful for its ptosecution or maintenance, the officers in
charge of the works might, in the name of the United States,
take possession of and use the same, after having first paid, or
secured to be paid, the value thereof, "which may have been
ascertained in the mode provided by the laws of the State"
wherein the property lay.
The act also provided that in case any lands or other property'were then or should be overflowed or injured by means of
any part of the works of the improvement theretofore or
thereafter constructed, for which compensation was then or
should become legally owing, and in the opinion of the officers
in charge it should'not be prudent to lower the dam or dams,
the amount of such compensation might be "ascertained in like'
manner;" that the department of justice should represent the
interest of the United States in legal proceedings under the
act and for "floWage damages" previously occasioned, and
that a portion of the appropriation made for the prosecution of
the improvement, npt exceeding in amount $25,000, might be
applied in payment for property and rights thus taken and
used.

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

In the previous year, 1874, the legislature of Wisconsin had
passed 'a law providing for ascertaining the compensation to be
made for damages caused to lands by their being overflowed or
otherwise injured or taken by the United States in the construction of any public works. It declared, among other things, that
in case the lands of any person had been overflowed or injured
or taken, or if it should be found necessary or proper thereafter to
overflow, injure, or take the lands of any person for or by reason
of the construction of any dam, bridge, lock or pier, or the repair
or'eulargement thereof, or the construction, repair, or enlargement of any canal or other works of the United States government in the improvement of any harbor,river, or stream of water
in the State, the compensation for damages sustained by the
owner or owners of the lands overflowed, injured, or taken
might be ascertained, determined, and paid in the manner prescribed in chapter 119 of the Laws of 1872, entitled "An Act
in relation to railroads and the organization of railroad companies," for acquiring title to lands by railroad companies, and
that all the provisions of such act propefly applicable thereto
should apply in the case of the overflow, injury, or taking of
lands by the United States government for the purposes
mentioned.
Chapter 119 of the Laws of 1872, referred to in this act of
1874, prescribes the mode in which land may be condemned
for railroad purposes. The company is to file a petition for the
appointment of commissioners of appraisal, with the clerk of the
circuit court of. the county in which the property is situated,
containing, among other things, a description of the land
desired and the names of parties interested in it. Notice is
then to be given, by publication for three successive weeks in a
newspaper of the county or adjoining county, of'the filing of
the petition, of the time and place of its presentation, and of
the application for the appointment of commissioners. On the
presentation of the petition the parties whose interest may be
affected by the proceedings are at liberty to show cause against
it prayer. If no sufficient cause be shown, the court or judge
may grant the petition and appoint three disinterested and
competent freeholders, resident in the county or adjoining

Opinion of the Court..

county, to ascertain and appraise the compensation to be made
to the owner or owners of the property. Either party to the
proceeding, if dissatisfied with the award rendered, may appeal
from it to the circuit court, where a trial is to be had by a jury,
and the compensation fixed by them. The proceeding, so far
as the ascertainment of compensation is concerned, there takes
the form of a regular action at law, in which the petitioner becomes the plaintiff and the contestants the 'defendants. The
chapter also provides that the party. interested in the land may.
institute and conduct the proceedings to a conclusion if the
company delay or omit to prosecute the same.
Under the legislation referred to, the present proceeding was
instituted by the defendants in error to recover the value of
certain lands which had been overflowed by a dam constructed
by the canal company in the prosecution of the improvement
mentioned. In their petition they ask for the appointment of
commissioners for the appraisal of certain lands, which are described, and of the damage caused to them by a dam constructed by the canal company, but owned by the United
States, they having succeeded to the title and possession of the
company. They also set forth the ownership of the lands, the
injury to them from the dam causing the waters of Lake
Winnebago to set back and overflow them, and that the dam
cannot be maintained without a continuance of such injuries.
All the allegations required by the statute were set forth. Commissioners were accordingly appointed, before whom the parties
interested appeared, the United States being represented by counsel retained by the department of justice. They awarded the
petitioners the sum of $8,000. From this award both parties
appealed to the circuit court, where the case was tried before
a jury. Previously, however, to its being impanelled the defendants objected to the action of the court on three grounds:
First, that it had no jurisdiction of them; second, that it had
no jurisdiction to try a cause in which the United States were
a party; and, third, that the act of Congress of March 3d,
1875, was unconstitutional in that it assumed to confer upon
the State court authority to try a cause in which the United
States were a party. These objections were overruled, and the

trial resulted. in a verdict for the plaintiffs for $10,000. The
judgment entered thereon was affirmed (by the supreme court
of the State, and from that court the case is brought here on
writ of error.
Various exceptions were taken to the rulings of the court on
the trial, but as they do not involve any question of federal
law they are not open for consideration here.' The only point
presented upon which we can pass relates to the jurisdiction
of the court below; if that can be sustained its judgment must
be affirmed.
The positibn of the counsel of the United States in the court
below, as Ave understand it, whs substantially this: That the
power vested in the federal governme.nt to take private property for the public uses of the United States is, in its nature,
exclusive, and its exercise by any State is therefore prohibited
as completely as though the prohibition were expressed in
terms; that the power cannot, therefore, be delegated to the
State of Wisconsin; that the ascertainment of the compensation is involved in the exercise of the power as a necessary
part of it, inasmuch as there can be no lawful taking until com.
pensation is made;' and that the act of Congress transferring
to the State board and State court the function of ascertaining
the value of the property taken, and the amount of compensation
to be made, is therefore invalid.
.There
is, in this position, an assumption that the
ascertainment of the amount of compensation to be made is an essential
element of the power of appropriation; but such is not the
case. The power to take private property for public uses,
generally termed the right of eminent domain, belongs to every
independent government. It is an incident of sovereignty, and,
as said in Boom v. Patteson,98 U. S.106, requires no constitutional recognition. The provision found in the Fifth Amendwnent
to the federal Constitution, and in the Constitutions of the several
States, for just compensation for the property taken, is merely
a limitation upon the use of the power. .It is no part of the
power itself, but a condition upon which the power may be
-exercised. It is undoubtedly true that the power of appropriating private property to public uses vested in the general govern-

UNITED STATES v. JONES.
Opinion of the Court.

ment-its right of eminent domain, which Vattel defines to be
the right of disposing, in case of necessity and for the public
safety, of all the wealth of the country-cannot be transferred
to a State any more than its other sovereign attributes; and
that, when the use to which the property taken is applied is
public, the propriety or expediency of the appropriation cannot be called in question by any other authority. But
there is no reason why the compensation to be made may
not be ascertained by any appropriate tribunal capable of
estimating the value of the property. There is nothing in
the nature of the matter to be determined which calls for
the establishment of any special tribunal by the appropriating
power.
The proceeding for the ascertainment of the value of the
property and consequent compensation to be made, is merely
an inquisition to establish a particular fact as a preliminary to
the actdal taking; and it may be prosecuted before commissioners or special boards or the courts, with or without the
intervention of a jury, as the legislative power may designate.
-All that is required is that it shall be conducted in some fair
and just manner, with opportunity to the owners of the property to present evidence as to its value,-and to be heard
thereon. Whether the tribunal shall be created directly by an
act of Congress, or one already established by the States shall
be adopted for the occasion, is a mere matter of legislative discretion. Undoubtedly it was the purpose of the Constitution
to establish a general government independent of, and in some
respects superior to, that of the State governments-one which
could enforce its own laws through its own officers and tribunals; and this purpose was accomplished. That government can create all the officers and tribunals required for the
execution of its powers. Upon this point there can be no
question. Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S. 367. Yet from the
time of its establishment that government has been in the
habit of using, with the consent of the States, their officers,
tribunals, and institutions as its agents. Their use has not been
deemed violative of any principle or as in any manner derogating from the sovereign authority of the federal government;

OCTOBER TERM, 1883.
Opinion of the Court.

but as a matter of convenience and as tending to a great saving of expense.
The use of the courts of the States in applying the rules of
naturalization prescribed by CongresS, the exercise at one time
by ,State justices of the peace of the power of committing
'magistrates for violations of federal law, and the use of State
penitentiaries for the confinement of convicts under such laws,
are instances of the employment of State tribunals and State
institutions in the execution of powers of the general government. At different times various duties have been imposed by
acts of Congress on State tribunals; they have been invested
with jurisdiction in civil suits and over complaints and prosecutions for fines, penalties, and: forfeitures arising under laws
of the United States. 1 Kent, 400. And though the jurisdiction thus conferred could not be enforced against the consent
of the States, yet, when its exercise was not incompatible
with State duties, and the States made no objection to it, the
decisions rendered by the State tribunals were upheld. Whatever question might arise as to such delegation of authority,
we can see none where the inquiry relates to an incidental
fact, not involving in its ascertainment the exercise of any sovereign attribute. Almost, if not quite from the first year of
its existence, it has been the practice of the general government, when necessary to take private property for public uses,
to resort to State boards and tribunals to ascertain the value
of the property and hence the compensation to be made. Burt
v. Jerohants'In. Co., 106 Mass. 356. In recent statutes such
resort is expressly prescribed. For example, on the 3d of
March, 1879, an act was passed for improving a part of Tennessee River, which provided that, whenever it became necessary to take private property, "1the price to be paid shall be determined, and the title and jurisdiction procured, in the manner
prescribed by the laws of the State of Alabama." And, on the
14th of June, 1880, an act was passed making an appropriation for constructinS reservoirs on the head waters of the Mississippi, with a provision that "injuries occasioneal to individuals by the overflow of their lands shall be ascertained and
determined by agreement, or in accordance with the laws of

UNITED STATES v. JONES.
Opinion of the Court.

Minnesota." These are but examples of many instances of
legislation where resort is had to local boards or tribunals to
ascertain particular facts by which the general government
may be guided in its action. Whatever assent may be necessary to the validity of the proceedings against the United
States, owing to their general immunity from process, is given
by such legislation.
The provisions of the act of 1875, with reference to the
property overflowed by dams constructed in the improvement
of the navigation of Fox, and Wisconsin rivers, that the compensation to be made shall be ascertained in the mode and
manner prescribed by the laws of the State, and that in any
proceedings to ascertain such compensation the interests of the
United States shall be represented by the department of justice, constitute a sufficient waiver of immunity. The legislation amounts to a consent to such proceedings as the State laws
authorize for the condemnation of property in which the
United States are interested. In the -present case the overflow
of the property for which compensation was asked was caused
whilst the property was held by the canal company, before its
acquisition, in 1812, by the United States; and the legislation
is, in legal effect, little more than a declaration that the United
States will pay the compensation which may be awarded by
officers of the State in proceedings taken in accordance with
its laws. In any aspect in which the legislation can be viewed,,
we see no objection to it arising out of the independent or sovereign character of the government of the United States.
