OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Syllabus.

1, 1894, c. 116, 28 Stat. 212, raising the pay of mates, and
providing that "the law regulating the retirement of warrant
officers in the Navy shall be construed to apply to the twentyeight officers now serving as mates." This provision would be
quite unnecessary if, under the general provisions of law, they
fell within the designation of warrant officers.
After some hesitation and apparent confusion of opinion on
the part of the Navy Department, this was the construction of
the Revised Statutes finally settled upon by the Navy Regulations of 1893, Art. 28, and we think it is correct.. The only
difficulty in the case seems to have arisen from certain acts
prior to the Revised Statutes, notably the act of 1813, which
dealt with warranted "master's mates," under which mates
continued to be classified by the Navy Department as warrant
officers, 'until the Revised Statutes were adopted.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is, therefore,
Affirmed.

'UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
NEW YORK v. JNITED STATES.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Nos.

45, 180. Argued October 17, 18, 1895.-Decided January 6, 1898.

Any claim made against an Executive Department, "involving disputed
facts or controverted questions of law, where the amount in controversy
exceeds three thousand dollars, or where the decision will affect a class
of cases, or furnish a precedent for the future action of any Executive
Department in the adjustment of a class of cases, without regard to the
amount involved in the particular case, or where any authority, right,
privilege or exemption is claimed or denied under the Constitution of the
United States," may be transmitted to the Court of Claims by the head
of such Department under Rev. Stat., ยง 1063, for final adjudication;
provided, such claim be not barred by limitation, and be one of which, by
reason of its subject-matter and character, that court could take judicial
cognizance at the voluntary suit of the claimant.
Any claim embraced by Rev. Stat., ยง 1063, without regard to its amount, and

whether the claimant consents or not, may be transmitted under the act
of March 3,1883, c. 116, to the Court of Claims by the head of the Executive Department in which It is pending, for a report to such Dbpartment
of facts and conclusions of law for " its guidance and action."
Any claim embraced by that section may, in the discretion of the Executive
Department in which it is pending, and with the expressed consent of
the plaintiff, be transmitted to the Court of Claims, under the act of
March 3, 1887, c. 359, without regard to the amount involved, for a report,
merely advisory in its character, of facts or conclusions of law.
In every case, involving a claim of money, transmitted by the head of an
Executive Department to the Court of Claims under the act of.1March 3,,
1883, c. 116, a final judgment or decree may be rendered when it appears
to the satisfaction of the court, upon the facts established, that the case
is one of which the court, at the time such claim was filed in the Department, could have taken jurisdiction, at the voluntary suit of the claimant,
for purposes of final adjudication.
Whether the words "or matter" in the second section of that act embrace
any matters, except those involving the payment of money, and of
which the Court of Claims under the statuies regulating its jurisdiction
could, at the voluntary suit of the claimant, take cognizance for purposes
of final judgment or decree, is not considered.
As the claim of the State of New York, the subject of controversy in this
case, was presented to the Treasury Department before it was barred by
limitation, its transmission by the Secretary of the Treasuryto the Court
of Claims for adjudication was only a continuation of the original proceeding commenced in that Department in 1862- and the delay by the
Department in disposing of the matter befbre the expiration of six years
after the cause of action accrued, could not impair the rights of the
State.
The 691,320.84: paid by the State of New York for interest upon its bonds
issued in 1861 to defray the expenses to be incurred in raising troops
for the national defence was a principal sum which the United States
agreed to pay, and not interest within the meaning of the rule prohibiting the allowance of interest accruing upon claims against the United
States prior to the rendition of judgment thereon.
Tc claim of the State of New York for money paid on account of interest
to the commissioners of the Canal Fund, is not one against the United
States for interest as such, but is a claim for costs, charges and expenses
properly incurred and psaid by"the State in aid of the general government, and is embraced by the act of Congress declaring that the States
would be indemnified by the -general government for money so expended.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

delivered the opinion of the court.

On the 3d day of January, 1889, the Secretary of the Treasury transmitted to the Court of Claims all the papers and
vouchers relating to a claim of the State of New York against
the United States, then pending in the Treasury Department,
for interest paid on money borrowed and expended in enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, and equipping troops for the suppression of the rebellion of 1861.
That claim, the Secretary certified, involved controverted
questions of law, and exceeded three thousand dollars in
amount. The communication accompanying the papers stated
that the case was transmitted to the Court of Claims under
and by authority of section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, to
be there proceeded in according to law.
In further prosecution of this claim, the State promptly
.fikld its petition in the court below and asked judgment
against the United States for the sum of $131,188.02 with
interest from the first day of July, 1862, together with such
other relief as would be in conformity with law.
This claim was based on the act of Congress of July 27,
1861, c..21, providing that "th&Secretary of the Treasury be,
and he is hereby directed, out of any money in the Treasury
not other vise appropriated, to pay to the Governor of any
State, or to his duly authorized agents, the costs, charges, and
expenses properly incurred by such State for enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, equipping, paying, and
transporting its troops employed in aiding to suppress the
present insurrection .against, the United States, to be settled
upon proper vouchers to be filed and passed upon by the
proper accounting officers of the Treasury." 12 Stat. 276.
_.By a joint resolution of Congress, approved Maroh 8, 1862,

UITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

it was declared that the above act should be construed "to
apply to expenses incurred as well after as before the date
of the approval thereof." 12 Stat. 615.
Before July 4, 1861, the State of New York -pursuant to
a statute passed by its legislature April 15, 1861, c. 277- enlisted, enrolled, armed, equipped, and caused to. be mustered
into the military service of the United States for the period
of .two years or during the war thirty thousand troops to- be
employed in suppressing the rebellion. That statute provided
that all expenditures for arms, supplies or equipments necessary for such forces should be made under the direction of',
the Governor and other named officers, and that the moneys
therefor should, on the certificate of the Governor, be drawn
from the treasury on the warrant of the comptroller in favor
of such person or persons as from time to time were designated by the Governor; and the sum of $3,000,000, or so
much thereof as was necessary, was appropriated out of any
moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated to defray
the expenses authorized by that act, or any other expenses of
mustering the militia of the State or any part thereof into the
service of the United States. That act also imposed, for the
fiscal year commencing on the 1st day of October, 1861, a
state tax to meet the expenses authorized, not to exceed two
mills on each dollar of the valuation of real and personal
property in the State. Laws of N. Y. 84th Session, 1861,
page 634.
There was no money in the treasury of the State in 1861
that had not been specifically appropriated for the expenses of
the state government; none that bould have been used to defray the expenses of enlisting, enrolling, arming, equipping,
and mustering troops into the service of the United States.
Under the laws of the State the moneys authorized to be
raised by the act of April 15, 1861, did not reach the state
treasurkr and were not available for use until the months of
April and May, 1862.
The total state tax rate fixed at the session of the legislature
beginning on the first Tuesday in January, 1861, was 3j mills,
of which lj mills was the amount authorized by the above

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

statute of 1861. The moneys realized from this tax were paid
into the state treasury during the year 1862.
The State had no other means of raising the money required
for the purpose of immediately defraying the expenses of enlisting, enrolling, arming, equipping, and mustering in such
troops, except by borrowing money in anticipation of the collection of its taxes; and between June 3, 1861, and July 2,
1861, in order to provide for the public defence, it issued bonds
in anticipation of such taxes to the amount of $1,250,000, payable on July 1, 1862, except that $100,000 was made payable
June 1, 1862, at the rate of seven per cent per annum, which
at that time was the legal rate of interest under the laws of
the State.
The issuing of these bonds was necessary for the purpose
of providing the money required, and upon their sale the
full amount of their face value was received and was used
and applied by the State, together with other moneys, in
raising troops. The entire sum so expended between the
23d day of April, 1861, and the 1st day of January, 1862,
was $2,873,501.19 exclusive of interest upon the bonds or
loans made by the State for that purpose.
In addition to the above sums, the State during the years
1861 and 1862 paid, on account of interest that accrued on its
bonds issued in anticipation of the tax for the public defence,
the sum of $91,320.84.
By a statute of New York of April 12, 1862, the legislature
specifically appropriated the sum of $1.250,000 for the redemption of comptroller's bonds issued for loans in anticipation of
the tax imposed by the act of April 15, 1861, c. 192, and the
a4ditional sum of $91,320.84 for the payment of the accruing
interest on those bonds. Laws of N. Y. 1862, 85th Session,
364.
Of the remainder.of the above sum of $2,873,501.19 necessarily expended by the State of New York for the purpose
stated, between April 23, 1861, and January 1, 1862, after deducting the amount of $1,250,000 raised by issuing bonds,
$1,623,501.19 was taken from the Canal Fund of the State.
That Fund, under the constitution of the State, was a Sinking

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

Fund for the ultimate payment of what is known as the canal
debt. Const. N. Y. 1S46, Art. VII, Sec. 1.
Under the tax rate of 1860 there had been levied and collected and paid into the treasury of the State the sum of
$2,039,663.06 for the benefit of and to the credit of the Canal
Fund. That sum reached the state treasury in April and May,
1861, subject to be invested by the state officers pursuant to
the requirements of law and the constitution of the State, in
securities for the benefit of the Canal Fund. On May 21,
1861, the lieutenant governor, comptroller, treasurer, and the
attorney general, constituting the commissioners of the Canal
Fund, authorized the comptroller to use $2,000,000 of 'the
Canal Fund moneys for military purposes until ihe 1st of October next, and $1,000,000. until the 1st day of Jahuary, 1862,
at five per cent; and of this amount the sum of $1,623,501.19
was used by the comptroller for the purpose of defraying the*
expenses of raising and equipping such troops. The following
was the order: "State of New York, Canal Department,
Albany, May 21, 1861. The comptroller islto be permitted to
use two millions of dollars of the Canal Fund moneys for
military purposes until the first day of October next, when
the commissioners of the Canal Fund will invest one million
of dollars of the Canal Sinking Fund under section 1, article
VII, in the tax levied for military purposes until the 1st of
July, 1862, at five per cent, and the Comptroller may use one
million of dollars of the tax levied to pay interest on the
$12,000,000 debt until the 1st of January, 1862, when the commissioners will, if they have the means, replace that or as large
an amount as they may have the means to do it with from the
toll of the next fiscal year, so -asthat the whole advance from
the Canal Fund on account of the tax be two millions of dollars. It is understood the comptroller will retain the taxes
now in process of collection for canal purposesuntil the above
investments are made, paying the funds five per cent interest
therefor." This order was sighed by the commissioners of the
Canal Fund.
On December 28, 29, and 31, 1861, the United States repaid
to the State, on account of moneys so expended .by the latter,

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

the sum of $1,113,000 which sum with interest was placed in
the Canal Fund on April 4, 1862. This left $510,501.19 unpaid of the moneys used from the Canal Fund.
The amount of interest at 5 per cent. per annum on the
moneys of the Canal Fund during the time it was used by the
State in raising troops was $48,187.13. But during the same
time the State had received interest on portions of those
moneys, while it was lying in bank unused, to the amount of
$8319.95, and the net deficiency of the State on account of
interest on such moneys during the period when they were so
used was $39,867.18, which sum was paid into the Canal Fund
from the state treasury.
The total amount paid by the State for interest upon its
bonds issued in anticipation of the tax for the public defence,
and upon the moneys of the Canal Fund used for the purpose
of defraying the expenses of raising and equipping troops, was
$131,188.02. No part of that sum has.been paid by the
United States.
The moneys above specified as actually expended by the
State of New York were necessarily expended for the purpose
of enlisting, enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming,
equipping, paying, and transporting such troops and causing
them to be mustered into the military service of the Upited
States, and were so paid and expended at the request of the
civil and military authorities of the United States.
Prior to January 3, 1889, the State had presented, from
time to time, various claims and accounts to the Treasury
Department of the United States for charges and expenses
incurred by it in enlisting, enrolling, arming, equipping, and
mustering troops into the military service of the United States.
Those claims amounted in the aggregate to $2,950,479.46,
and included charges for all the moneys paid and placed
as hereinbefore specified. The department, from time to
time, allowed thereon various sums aggregating $2,775,915.24,
leaving a balance of $174,564.22 not allowed, and the claims
for which were pending in the Department unadjusted when
this case was transmitted to the Court of Claims on the 3d
day of January, 1889. Of that sum of $174,564. 2 the sums

Opinion of the Court.

hereinbefore specified, amounting to $131,188.02, constituted
a part.
The claim of the State for expenditures in furnishing troops
with clothing and munitions of war was filed in the Treasury
Department in May, 1862, and included the above items of interest. The claim for interest has from that time been suspended in the Department, and was so suspended at the time
it was transmitted to the Court of Claims.
The court, after finding the facts substantially as above
stated, gave judgment in favor of the State for $91,320.84-,
on account of interest paid upon its bonds issued in anticipation of taxes imposed for the public defence. From that
judgment the United States appealed. The State also appealed, and clalins that it was entitled to judgment for the
additional sum of $39,861.13 paid into what is called the
Canal Fund. as interest upon the moneys it had borrowed
from that fund to be repaid with interest..
The Government moved to dismiss the State's appeal, its
contention being that the judgment brought here by the State
for review is not obligatory in character and appealable, but
only ancillary and advisory. This motion assumes that the
court below was without jurisdiction under existing legislative enactments to render a final judgment, reviewable by this
court, upon any claim, whatever its amount, made against an
Executive Department and transinitted to the Court of Claims
to be therie proceeded in according to law.
We recognize the importance.of the question thus preSsented, and have bestowed upon it the most careful consideration. Its solution can be satisfactorily reached only by
an examination of the various statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, including those known as.the
Bowman act of March 3, 1883, c. 116, 22 Stat. 485, and the
Tucker act 'of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505*
By the act of Congress of July 27, 1861, c. 21, the Secretary
of the Treasury was directed, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and upon vouchers to be passed

costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred by any State in
enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, equipping,
paying, and transporting its troops to be employed in suppressing the rebellion of 1861. 12 Stat. 276.
The claim of New York was founded on the above act of
Congress of July 27, 1861, if not on contract with the United
States. It was transmitted by the Secretary of the Treasury
to the Court of Claims under section 1063 of the Revised
Statutes as one involving controverted questions of law.
By the act of June 25, 1868, c. 71, ยง 7, the jurisdiction
of the Court of Claims was enlarged so as to embrace several classes of claims that might be transmitted to it by the
head of an Executive Department for adjudication. 15 Stat.
75, 76.
The provisions of that act were preserved in section 1063 of
the Revised Statutes which is as follows: "Sec. 1063. Whenever any claim is made against any Executive Department,
involving disputed facts or controverted questions of law,
where the amount in controversy exceeds three thousand
dollars, or where the decision will affect a class of cases, or
furnish a precedent for the future action of any Executive
Department in the adjustment of a class of cases, without
regard to the amount involved in the particular case, or where
any authority, right, privilege, or exemption is claimed or denied under the Constitution of the United States, the head of
such Department may cause such claim, with all the vouchers,
papers, proofs, and documents pertaining thereto, to be transmitted to the Court of Claims, and the same shall be there
proceeded in as if originally commenced by the voluntary action of the claimant; and the Secretary of the Treasury may,
upon the certificate of any Auditor or Comptroller of the
Treasury, direct any account, matter, or claim, of the character, amount, or class described in this section, to be transmitted, with all the vouchers, papers, documents, and proofs
pertaining thereto, to the said court, for trial and adjfidication:
Provided, That no case shall be referred by any head of a
Department unless it belongs to one of the several classes of
cases which, by reason of the subject-matter and character,

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

the said court might, under existing laws, take jurisdiction of
on such voluntary action of the claimant."
It is clear that under this section no claim against an Executive Department, not otherwise described than as one "involving disputed facts or controverted questions of law," could be
transmitted to the Court of Claims for adjudication unless the
amount in-controversy exceeded three thousand dollars. It is
equally clear that that section did not make the amount juris.
dictional where a claim of that class is transmitted as one the
decision of which would affect a class of cases, or furnish a
precedent for the action of the Executive Department in adjusting a class of cases; nor where any authority, right, privi.
lege, or exemption was claimed or denied under the Constitution of the United States. But, as bearing on the inquiry to
be presently made whether, that section was superseded by
subsequent enactments; it should be here noted that there
might be claims in the hands of an Auditor or of the Comptroller of the Treasury for examinatioh, which in the first instance were to be passed on by some other Department than
that of the Treasury. Claims of that special class could not
be transmitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Court
of Claims, under section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, for
adjudication, except " upon the certificate of the Auditor or
Comptroller of the Treasury," having it under Iexamination.
This is indicated not only by the words of that section, but
by sections 1064 and 1065, the first of which sections provides
that "all cases transmitted by the head of any Department, or
upon the certificate of any Auditor or -Comptroller, according
to the provisions of the preceding section, shall- be proceeded
in as other cases pending in the Court of Claims, and shall, in
all respects, be subject, to the same rules and regulations ;"
and the latter, that "the amount of any final judgment or
decree rendered in favor of the claimant, in any case transmitted to the Court of Claims under the two preceding sections, shall be paid out of any specific appropriation applicable
to the case, if any such there be; and where no such appropriation exists -the judgment or decree'shall be paid in the
same manner as other judgments of the said court."

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

We come now to what is known as the Bowman act of
March 3, 1883, c. 116, entitled "An act to afford assistance
and relief to Congress and the Executive Departments in the
investigation of claims and demands against the Government."
22 Stat. 485.
By the first section of that act it is provided: "See. 1.
Whenever a claim or matter is pending before any committee
of the Senate or House of Representatives, or before either
House of Congress, which involves the investigation and
determination of facts, the committee or House may cause the
same, with the vouchers, papers, proofs, and documents pertaining thereto, to be transmitted to the Court of Claims of
the United States, and the same shall there be proceeded in
under such rules as the court may adopt. When the facts
shall have been found, the court shall not enter judgment
thereou, but shall report the same to the committee or to the
House by which the case was transmitted for its consideration."
The second section is in these words: "Sec. 2. When a
claim or matter is pending in any of the Executive Departments which may involve controverted questions of fact or
law, the head of such Department may transmit the same,
with the vouchers, papers, proofs, and documents pertaining
thereto, to said court, and the same shall be there proceeded
in under such rules as the court may adopt. When the facts
and conclusions of law shall have.been found, the court shall
not enter judgment thereon, but shall report its findings and
opinions to the Department by which it was transmitted for
its guidance and action."
As the Bowman act contains no words of express repeal,
the question arises whether, by necessary implication, its second section superseded section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, in
respect of claims transmitted by an Executive Department to
the Court of Claims.
The Court of Claims was required by section 1063 of the
Revised Statutes to adjudicate any claim, properly transmitted
from' an Executive Department, by a final judgment, while
the Bowman act prohibited any judgment being entered for

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

or against a claim transmitted under that act; the duty of the
court, in cases involving controverted questions of fact or law,
transmitted to and heard by it under the Bowman act, being
only to report its findings of fact and conclusions of law to the
proper Department, for "its guidance and action."
It is, nevertheless, suggested that-the Bowman act, although
without words of repeal, covers the entire subject of claims
involving controverted questions of fact or law that may be
transmitted to the Courtof Claims from an Executive Department, and, it is argued, that we must apply the rule that a
prior statute is to be regarded as repealed or modified where
"the last statute is so broad in its terms and so clear and explicit in its words as to show that it was intended to cover the
whole subject, and, therefore, to displace the prior statute."
Frost v. Wenie, 157 U. S. 46, 58.
If that act be held to' have displaced the whole of section
1063 of the Revised Statutes (except the clause relating to
claims transmitted by the Secretary. of the Treasury, upon the
certificate of an Auditor or of the Comptroller of th3 Treasury)
the result would be that after its passage the Court of Claims
was wholly without jurisdiction to render judgment oe any
claim for money transmitted from an ExecutiveDepartment,
whatever its nature or amount. Such a construction would
exclude fom judicial cognizance by that court not only claims
exceeding $3000 in amount, and specifically designated as
claims involving controverted questions of law and fact, but
even claims the determination of which would affect a class of
cases, or furnish a precedent for the future action of an Executive Department, and claims that involved an authority,
right, privilege, or exemption asserted or denied under the
Constitution of the United States. Congress, when it passed
the Bowman act, must have had in view the provisions of
section 1063 of the Revised Statutes under which the Court of
Claims had so long exercised jurisdiction of claims for money
made against an Executive Department and transmitted to
that court for final adjudication. As the Bowman act makes
no reference to that section, and contains no words of repeal,
we cannot suppose that Congress intended to take from the
voL. CLX-39

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

Court of Claims jurisdiction to render judgment in cases coming before it under the Revised Statutes. The object of that
act is expressed in its title, and was to afford assistance and
relief to Congress and the Executive Departments in the investigation of claims and demands against the Government. Tothat end, and in respect of claims and demands involving controverted questions of fact or law and pending in the Executive Departments, authority was given to the heads of such
Departments upon their own motion, and whether the claimant desired it or not, to obtain, for their "guidance and
action," findings of fact and conclusions of law, without regard
to the amount involved. Billings v. United States, 23 0. C1.
166, 174. Neither expressly nor by necessary implication did
that act take from an Executive Department the right to
send to the Court of Claims, for fnal adjudication,any claim
made against it that was embraced by section 1063 of the Revised Statutes. So far as the Bowman act related to claims
for money pending in an Executive Department, it only
authorized the head of the Department to send them to that
court for a report of facts and conclusions that would not
have the force of a judgment reviewable by this court. In
this view, there is no conflict between the Bowman act and
the Revised Statutes. As there are no words of repeal in the
Bowman act, we have given it such construction as will make
it consistent with previous legislation, and thus avoid the
abrogation of existing statutes which Congress had not repealed either expressly or by necessary implication. The second section of the Bowman act should be construed as if it
were a proviso to section 1063 of the Revised- Statutes. Thus
construed the later statute is not in conflict with the earlier
one.
We turn now to the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, known as
the Tucker act, entitled "An act to provide for the bringing
of suits against the Government of the United States." 24
Stat. 505.
The first section of that act gives the Court of Claims original jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims founded upon
the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress,

UNITED STATES v. NEW Y0RKX
Opinion of the Court.

except for pensions, or upon any regulation of an Executive
Department, or upon any contract, expressed or implied, with
the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect
of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against
the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty
if the United States were suable: nothing, however, in that
section to be construed as giving to any of thecourts mentioned in the act jurisdiction to hear and determine claims
growing out of the late Civil War, and commonly known as
"war claims," nor other claims theretofore rejected, or reported on adversely by any court, Department, or commission
authorized to hear and determine the same. Jurisdiction was
also given of all set-offs, counterclaims, -claims for damages,
whether liquidated or unliquidated, or other demands whatsoever. on the part of the Government of the United States
against any claimant. It also provided that no suit against
the G6vernment of the United States should be allowed under
that act unless the same was brought within six years after
the right accrued for which the claim is made.
Other sections of that act are as follows:
"SEc., 12. That when any claim or matter may be pending
in any of the Executive Departments which involves controverted questions of fact or law, the head of such Department,
with the consent of the claimant, may transmit the same, with

the vouchers, papers, proofs, and documents pertaining thereto,
to said Court of Claims, and the same shall be there proceeded
in under such rules as the court- may adopt. When. the facts
and conclusions of law shall have been found, the court shall
report its findings to the Department ,by which it was transmitted.
"S1Ec. 13. That in every case which shall come before the
Court of Claims, or is now pending therein, under the provisions of an act entitled 'An'act to afford assistance and relief

upon the facts established, that it has jurisdiction to render
judgment or decree thereon under existing laws or under the
provisions of this act, it shall proceed to do so, giving to either
party such further opportunity for hearing as in its judgment
justice shall require, and report its proceedings therein to
either House of Congress or to the Department by which the
same was referred to said court." By its sixteenth section all
laws and parts of laws inconsistent with that act were repealed.
What is the scope of the twelfth section of the Tucker act?
iDid that section supersede section 1063 of the Revised Statutes,
or section two of the Bowman act?
It is difficult to tell what was intended by the words "with
the consent of the claimant," in the twelfth section of the
Tucker act. If Congress intended that no claim, large or
small in amount, involving controverted questions of fact or
law, and pending in an Executive Department, should be
transmitted to the Court of Claims, except with the consent
of the claimant, that intention would have been expressed
in words that could not have been misunderstood; for that
court had long exercised jurisdi6tion in cases of that kind.
But, in view of the words used, no such purpose can be imputed to Congress. The Tucker act cannot be held to have
taken the place of section two of the Bowman act; for section
thirteen of the Tucker act distinctly provides for judgment in
every case then pending in or which might come before the
Court of Claims under the Bowman act, of which that court
could have taken judicial cognizance if the case had been
commenced originally by suit instituted in that court by the
claimant. That Congress did not intend to supersede the
Bowman act is made still more apparent by the fourteenth
section of the Tucker act, declaring " that whenever any bill,
except for a .pension, shall be pending in either House of Congress providing for the payment of a claim against the United
States, legal or equitable, or for a grant, gift, or bounty to
any person, the house in which such bill is pending may
refer the same to the Court of Claims, who shall proceed with
the same in accordance with the provisionsof the act approved

act to afford assistance and relief to Congress and the Executive Departments in the investigation of claims and demands
against the Government,' [the Bowman act] and rep6rt to
such House the facts in the case and the amount, where the
same can be liquidated, etc." It thus, appears that any bill,
except for a pension, in either House of Congress, providing
for the payment of a claim against the United States, legal or
equitable, or for a grant, gift, or bounty to any person, may
be transmitted to the Court of Claims, to be proceeded in, not,
let it be observed, under the Tucker act, but under the Bowman act of March 3, 1883, and to report the facts, etc., to such
House. It is impossible, therefore, to hold that the Tucker
act displaced or repealed the second section of the Bowman
act.
In our opinion the twelfth section of the Tucker act should
be construed as not referring to claims which an Executive
Depacrtuxent, proceeding under section 1063 of the Revised
Statutes, seeks to have finally adjudicated by the Court of
Claims, nor to claims described in that section, in respect of
which the Department, upon its own motion, and whether
the claimant consents or not, desires from that court a report
under the Bowman act, of facts and law for its guidance and
action. It refers only to claims which the head of an Executive Department, with the expressed consent of the claimant,
may send to the Court of Claims in order to obtain a report
of facts and law which the Department may regard as only
advisory. It no doubt often happened that the head of a
Department did not desire action by the Court of Claims in
relation to a particular claim, but, in order to meet the wishes
of the claimant, was willing to have a finding by that court
which was not followed by a judgment, nor by any rep6rt
for the guidance and action of the Department. So that section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, the second section of the
Bowman act, and the twelfth section of the Tucker act may
be regarded as parts of one general system, covering different
states of case, and standing together without conflict in any
essential particular.
The claim of New York, being for money and founded on

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.

an act of Congress, was within the general jurisdiction of the
Court of Claims. If not barred by limitation it could, in the
discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, have been transmitted or certified to the Court of Claims under the Bowman
act after its passage for a finding of facts or law, and that
court, when the Tucker act came into operation, could, under
its thirteenth section, have rendered a final judgment, sending, however, to the Treasury Department a report of its
proceedings. But the Secretary of the Treasury, in the exercise of an authority given him by statute and never withdrawn, chose to certify or transmit this claim to the Court of
Claims, under section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, for final
adjudication.
Touching the suggestion that the twelfth section of the
Tucker act entirely superseded the second section of the
Bowman act, it may be further observed that the Tucker act
repeals only such previous statutes as were inconsistent with
its provisions. There is no inconsistency between the sections just named; one, as we have said, the second section
of the Bowman act, relating to claims involving controverted
questions of fact or law, which an Executive Department
may transmit to the Court of Claims without consulting the
wishes of the claimant, in order to obtain a report of facts
and law for its guidance and action; the other, the twelfth
section of the Tucker act, relating to claims of the same class
transmitted to that court with the expressed consent of the
claimant in order to obtain a report of facts and law that
would be only advisory in its character.
The object of the thirteenth section of the Tucker act is
quite apparent. A case transmitted under the Bowman act
is, we have seen, one in which the findings of fact and law
are made for the guidance and action of the Executive Department from which it came, and, therefore, a rendition of
judgment, in su6h a case, if it be one of which the court could
at the outset have taken cognizance at the voluntary suit of
the claimant, would be a saving of time for all concerned. If
the cases embraced by the twelfth section of the Tucker act
were only those provided for by the second section of the

UNITED STATES v. IEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

Bowman act, the thirteenth section of the Tucker act, authorizing a final judgment or decree where the claim was one
of which the court couldl2originally have taken jurisdiction
for purposes, of final adjudication, would not have made
special reference' to cases coming before the Court of Claims
under the-Bowman act.
Our conclusions, then, as to the several statutes under examination, so far as they relate to claims pending in an Executive Department, are First. Any claim made against an Executive Department,
"involving disputed facts or controverted questions of law,
where the amount in controversy exceeds three thousand dollars, or where the decision will affect a class of cases, or
furnish a precedent for the future action of any Executive
Department in the adjustmeiit of a class of cases, without
regard to the amount involved in the particular case, or
where any authority, right, privilege or exemption is claimed
or denied under the Constitution of the United States," may
be transmitted to the Court of Claims by the head of such
department under section 1063 of the Revised Statutes for
final adjudication; provided, such claim be not barred by
fimitatibn, and be one of which, by reason of its subjectmatter and character, that court could take judicial cognizance at the voluntary suit of the claimant.
Second. Any claim embraced by section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, without regard to its amount, and -whether
the claimant consents or not, may be transmitted under the
Bowman act to-the Court of Claims by the head of the Executive Department in which it is pending, for a report to
such department of facts and conclusions of law for "its
guidance and action."
Third. Any claim embraced by that section may, in the
discretion of the Executive Department in which it is pending, and with the expressed consent-of -the plaintiff, be transmitted to the Court of Claims, under the Tucker act, without
regard to the amount involved, for a report, merely advisory
in its character, of facts or conclusions of law.
Fourth. In every case, involving a claim of money, trans-.

mitted by the head of an Executive Department to the Court
of Claims under the Bowman act, a final judgment or decree
may be rendered when it appears o the satisfaction of the
court, upon the facts established, that the case is one of which
the court, at the time such claim was filed in the department, could have taken jurisdiction, at the voluntary suit of
the claimant, for purposes of final adjudication.
Whether the words "or matter" in the second section of
the Bowman act embrace any matters, except those involving the payment of money, and of which the Court of Claims
under the statutes regulating its jurisdiction could, at the voluntary suit of the claimant, take cognizance for purposes of
final judgment or decree, need not be now considered.
It results that as the claim of New York exceeded three
thousand dollars, and was certified under section 1063 of the
Revised Statutes as one involving controverted questions of
law, the court below had jurisdiction to proceed to a .final
judgment, unless, as suggested by the Assistant Attorney
General, the claim When transmitted to the Court of Claims
by the Secretary of the Treasury was barred by limitation.
At the time the claim of New York was filed in the Treasury Department there was no statute of limitations in force
expressly applicable to cases in the Court of Claims. But by
the act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, ยง 10, it was provided that
(with certain exceptions that have no application to this
case) every claim against the United States, cognizable by
the Court of Claims, should be barred unless the .petition
setting forth a statement of it was filed in or transmitted
to that court within six years after the claim first accrued;
claims that had accrued before the passage of that act not
to be barred, if filed or transmitted as above stated, Within
three years after the passage of the act. 12 Stat. 765, 767.
This limitation of six years was preserved in the Revised
Statutes and in the Tucker act. Rev. Stat. ยง 1069; 24 Stat.
505.

Was the claim of New York barred because more than six
years passed after it accrued before it was transmitted to the
Court of Claims? In Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227, 232,

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

this court said: "The general rule that limitation does not
operate by its own force as a bar, but is a defence, and that
the party maling such a defence must plead the statute if he
wishes the benefit of its provisions, has no application to suits
in the Court of Claims against the United States. An individual
may waive such a defence,' either expressly or by failing to
plead the statute; but the Government has not expressly or
by implication conferred authority upon any of its officers to
waive the limitation imposed by statute upon suits against the
United States in the Court of Claims. Since the Government
is not liable to be sued, as of right, by any claimant, and since
it has assented to a judgment being rendered against it only
in certain classes of cases, brought within a prescribed period
after the cause of action accrued, a judgment in the Court of
Claims for the amount of a claim which the record or evidence
shows to be barred by the statute, would be erroneous." To
the same effect was DeAr'naud v. Uni'ed States, 151 U. S.
483, 495.
But, in United Btatms v. Lippiti, 100 U. S. 663, 668, 669,
where the question was whether a claim that accrued in 1864,
and which was presented to the War Department in 1865, and
in 1878 was transmitted to the Court of Claims as one involving controverted questions of law, the decision whereof would
affect a class of cases, the court said: "Limitation is not
pleadable in the Court of Claims, against a claim cognizable
therein, and which has been referred by the head of an Executive Department for its judicial determination, provided such
claim was presented for settlement at the proper department
within six years after it first accrued, that is, within six years
after suit could be commenced thereon against the Government. Where the claim is of such a character that it may be
allowed and settled by an Executive Department, or may, in
the discretion of the head of such department, be referred to
the Court of Claims for final determination, the ifiling of the
petition should relate back to the date when it was first presented at the department for allowance and settlement. In
such cases, the statement of the facts, upon which the claim
rests, in the form of a petition, is only another mode of assert-

Opinion of the Court.

ing the same demand which had previously and in due time
been presented at the proper department for settlement.
These views find support in the fact that the act of 1868
describes claims presented at an Executive Department for
settlement, and which belong to the classes specified in its
seventh section, as cases which may be transmitted to the
Court of Claims. 'And all the cases mentioned in this section,
which shall be transmitted by the head of any Executive Department, or upon the certificate of any auditor or comptroller, shall be proceeded in as other cases pending in said
court, and shall, in all respects, be subject to the same rules
and regulations,' with right of appeal. The cases thus trans
mitted for judicial determination are, in the sense of the act,
commenced against the Government when the claim is. originally presented at the department for examination and settlement. Upon their transfer to the Court of Claims they are to
be ' proceeded in as other cases in said court.'"
The same principle was recognized in Finn v. United States,
123 U. S.' 227, 232, in which case the court, referring to the
act of 1863, limiting the time for bringing suits in the Court
of Claims, also said: "The duty of the court, under such
circumstances, whether limitation was pleaded or not, was to
dismiss the petition; for the statute, in our opinion, makes
it a condition or qualification of the right to a judgment
against the United States that - except where the claimant
labors under some of the disabilities specified in the statutes
- the claim must be put in suit by the voluntary action of
the claimant, or be presented to the proper department for
settlement, within six years after iuit could be commenced
thereon against the Government."
Upon the authority of those cases we adjudge that as the
claim of New York was presented to the Treasury Department before it was barred by limitation, its transmission by
the Secretary of the Treasury to the Court of Claims for adjudication was only a continuation of the original proceeding
commenced in that department in 1862. The delay by the department in disposing of the matter before the expiration of
six years after the cause of action accrued, could not impair the

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

rights of the State. Of coQurse, if the claim had not been presented to the Treasury Department before the expiration of
that period the Court of Claims could- not have entertained
I
jurisdiction of it.
For the reasons we have stated the motion of the United
States to dismiss the appeal of the State is denied, and we
proceed to the examination of the case upon its merits.
The entire sum for which the State asked judgment was
$131,188.02, of which $91,320.84: represented the amount paid
as interest oh moneys borrowed for the purpose of raising
troops for the national defence, and for the repayment of
which, with interest at seven per cent, the State executed its
short-time bonds. The. balance, $39,867.18, represented the
amount paid as interest on moneys received by way of loan
from the Canal Fund and applied by the State for the same
purpose.
On behalf of the. Government it is contended that payment
by the United States of the above sum of $91,320.84 is prohibited both by the statute, act of March 3, 1863, c. 92,12 Sfat.
765, Rev. Stat. ยง 1091, providing that interest shall not be
allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract
expressly stipulating for the .payment of interest, and by the
general rule based on grounds of public convenience, that
interest "is not to be awarded against a sovereign government;
unless its consent to pay interest has been manifested by an
act of its legislature, or .by a lawful contract of its executive
officers." United States v. North Carolina, 136 U. S. 211,
216; Angarica v. Bayard, 127 U. S.251, 260.
The allowance of the $91,320.84 would not contravene
either the statute or the general rule to which we have adverted. The duty of suppressing armed rebellion having for
its object the overthrow of the National Government, was
primarily upon that Government and not upon the several
States composing the Union. New York came promptly to
the assistance of the National Government by enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, equipping, payIng, and
transporting troops to be-employed in putting down the re-

bellion. Immediately after Fort Sumter was fired upon, its
legislature passed an act appropriating $3.000,000, or so much
thereof as was necessary, out of any moneys in its treasury
not otherwise appropriated, to defray any expenses incurred
for arms, supplies, or equipments for such forces as were raised
in that State and mustered into the service of the United
States. In order to meet the burdens imposed by this appropriation, the real and personal property of the people of New
York were subjected to taxation. When New York had suc-ceeded in raising thirty thousand soldiers to be employed in
suppressing the rebellion, the United States, well knowing
that the national existence was imperilled, and that the earnest coperation and continued support of the States was
required in order to maintain the Union, solemnly declared by
the act of 1861, that "the costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred" by any State in raising troops to. protect the
authority of the nation, would be met by the General Government. And to remove any possible doubt as to what
expenditures of a State would be so met, the act of 1862 declared that the act of 1861 should embrace expenses incurred
before, as well as after, its approval. It would be a reflection
upon the patriotic motives of Congress if we did not place a
liberal interpretation upon those acts, aind give effect to what,
we are not permitted to doubt, was intended by their passage.
Before the act of July 27, 1861, was passed the Secretary of
State of the United States telegraphed to the governor of New
York, acknowledging that that State had then furnished fifty
thousand troops for service in the war of the rebellion, and
thanking the governor for his efforts in that direction. And
on July 25, 1861, Secretary Seward telegraphed: "Buy arms
and equipments as fast as you can. We pay all." And on
July 27, 1861, that "Treasury notes for part advances will
be furnished on your call for them." On August 16, 1861,
the Secretary of War telegraphed to the governor of New
York: "Adopt such measures as may be necessary'to fill up
your regiments as rapidly as possible. We need the men.
Let me know the best the Empire State can do to aid the
country in the present emergency." And on February 11,

UNITED STATES 9. NEW YORKM
Opinion of the Court.

1862, he telegraphed: "The Government will refund the State
for the advances for troops as speedily as the Treasurer can
obtain funds for that purpose." Liberally interpreted, it is
clear that the acts of July 27, 1861, and March 8, 1862,
created, on the part of the United States, an obligation to indemnify the States for any costs, charges, and expenses properly incurredfor the purposes expressed in the act of 1861, the
title of 'which shows that its object was "to indemniify the
States for expenses incurred by them in defence of the United
States."
So that the only inquiry is whether, within the fair meaning of
the latter act, the words" costs, dharges, and expenses properly
incurred" included interest paid by the State of New York
on moneys borrowed for the purpose of raising, subsisting, and
supplying troops to be employed in. suppressing the rebellion.
We have no hesitation in answering this question in the affirmative. If that State was to give effective aid to the General
Government in its struggle with the organized forces of rebellion, it could only do so by borrowing money sufficient to meet
the emergency; for it had no money in its treasury that had
not been specifically appropriated for the.expenses of its own
government.' It could not have .borrowed money any more
than the General Government could have borrowed money,
without stipulating to pay such interest as was customary in
the commercial world. Congress did notexpect that any State
would decline to borrow and await the collection of money
raised by taxation before-it moved to the support of the nation.
It expected that each loyal State would, as did New York,
respond at once in furtherance of the avowed purpose of Congress, by whatever force necessary, to maintain the rightful
authority and existence of the National Government. We
cannot doubt that the interest paid by the State on its bonds,
issued to raise mbney for the purposes expressed by Congress,
constituted a part of the costs, charges, and expenses properly
incurred by it for those objects. Such interest, when paid,
became a principal sum, as between the State 'and the United
States, that is, became a part of the aggregate sum properly
paid by the State for the United States. The principal and

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

interest, so paid, constitutes a debt from the United States to
the State. It is as if the United States had itself borrowed
the money, through the agency of the State. We therefore
hold that the court below did not err in adjudging that the
$91,320.84 paid by the State for interest upon its bonds issued
in 1861 to defray the expenses to be incurred in raising troops
for the national defence was a principal sum which the United
States agreed to pay, and not interest within the meaning of
the rule prohibiting the allowance of interest accruing upon
claims against the United States prior to the rendition of
judgment thereon.
The Court of Claims disallowed so much of the State's
demand as represented interest paid by it on moneys borrowed
from the Canal Fund. The instalment of interest paid into
that Fund by the State was $48,187.13. But as the State
itself earned interest to the amount of $8319.95 on a part of
the money obtained by it from the commissioners of the Canal
Fund, it only claimed $39,867.18 on account of interest paid
to that Fund.
The Canal Fund was made by the constitution of the State
a sinking fund for the ultimate liquidation of what is known
as the canal debt of New York. In April and May, 1861,
$2,039,663.06 from the taxes of 1860 reached the treasury
of the State, and under the constitution and laws of New
York that amount should have been invested in securities
for the benefit of the Canal Fund, and the interest derived
from those securities paid into the Fund. The State was
permitted to use a part of the above sum under an agreement by its officers that interest thereon at the rate of five
per cent should be paid. It recognized and fulfilled that
agreement, and now claims that the interest it so paid to the
Canal Fund constituted a charge or expense properly incurred
in raising, subsisting, and supplying troops to suppress the
rebellion.
We are of opinion that, so far as the question of the liability of the United States is concerned, there is, on principle,
no difference between the claim for $91,320.84 and the claim
for $39,867.18. We do not stop to inquire whether the ac-

Opinion of the Court.

tion of the canal commissioners, in allowing the State to use
a part of the moneys collected for the benefit of the Canal
Fund, was strictly in accordance with law. Suffice it to say,
that the Canal Fund was entitled to any interest earned upon
moneys belonging to it, and fidelity to the constitution and
laws of lNew York required the State to recognize that right
in the only way it could at the time have been done, namely,
by paying the interest that ought to have been realized by
the commissioners of the Canal Fund, if they had invested in
interest-paying securities the moneys they permitted the State
to use for military purposes. If the Canal Fund money, used
by the state comptroller to defray the expenses of raising and
equipping troops, had been borrowed upon the bonds of the
State sold in open narket, the interest paid on such bonds
would, for the reasons we have stated, be a just charge against
the United States on account of expenses properly incurred by
the State for the purposes expressed by Congress. And such
would have been the result if the moneys of the Canal Fund
had been invested by the commissioners directly in bonds of
the State, bearing the same rate of interest that was paid to
the commissioners of that fund. The substance of the transaction was that the State, for moneys that could not be
legally appropriated for the ordinary expenses of its own
government, and which the law required to be so invested
as to earn interest for the Canal Fund, iused those moneys
for military purposes, under an agreement by its officers,
subsequently ratified by the State, to pay interest thereon.
It was, in its essence, a loan to the State by the commissioners of the Canal Fund of money to be repaid with interest. The obligation of the United States to indemnify
the State, on account of such payment, is quite as great as it
would be if the transaction had occurred between the State
and some corporation from which it borrowed the money.
It is not the case of the State taking money, out of one
pocket to supply a deficiency in another over which it had
full power; for, although the moneys brought into its treasury by the collection of taxes were under its control, the State
was without power to manage and control taxes collected for
