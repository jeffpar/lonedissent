HARSIMAN v. WINTERBOTTOM.
Statement of the Case.

STATE OF MISSOURI, eo rel. HARSHMAN v. WINTERBOTTOM.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
Submitted October 18, 1887. -Decided October 31, 1887.
A statute of Mtissouri authorized county collectors to collet county taxes,
and required them to receive in payment thereof warrants issued by the
county when presented by the legal holder. A, a holder of two county
warrants, presented them to the treasurer for payment, and payment was
refused, because there was no money in the treasury. A brought suit
agiinst the collector and his official bondsmen, to collect the amount due
on these warrants, alleging that the collector was authorized by law to
receive warrants in payment of taxes only from the holder in payment of
his own taxes; that this provision bad been disregarded by the collector
in receiving warrants from persons who were not legal holders, entitled
to use them; that all the tax-payers had thus made payments of taxes
and received acquittances without the actual payment of money from
1879 to 1881; and that the collector had once in each month during that
period settled with the county court, and his course in this respect had
been ratified and approved. The defendants demurred. The demurrer is
sustained by this court, (1) because it appeared that there was no contract relation between A and the collector on which he had a right to
bring the suit; and (2) because it appeared that the proper county officials
had settled with the collector, and ratified his acts, and discharged him
from any liability which might have .existed by reason of them.

THIS was an action brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Missouri against
John Winterbottom, as principal, and the other defendants as
sureties, on a bond given by Winterbottom to the State of
Missouri as collector of the revenue of the county of Knox in
said State. No copy of the bond is found in the record, but
the allegation of the petition in regard to the substance of it
was, "that on the 30th day of December;1878, said Winterbottom, as principal, and the other defendants, as sureties, executed a bond, whereby they acknowledged themselves to be
held and firmly bound unto the State of Missouri in the sum
of one hundred thousand dollars, for the payment of which

they bound themselves, their heirs, executors, and administra
tors; that said bond was conditioned that said Wifiterbottoin
should faithfully and punctually collect and pay over all state,
county, and other revenue for two years next ensuing the first
day of March, 1879, and should in all things faithfully perform
all the duties of the said office of collector according to law,
and that said bond was, on the day last aforesaid,. approved by
the said county court."
The petition also declared "that by law it was the duty of
said Winterllottom, as such collector, to collect all county
taxes of said county in money, except that-he was" authorized
and required to receive any county warrants issued by said
county, when presented to him by the legal holder thereof, in
payment of any county tax existing against said holder and
accruing to said county; that he was not required or author-.
ized to receive any such warrant from,any one other than the
legal holder thereof, and not from such holder except in payment of a county tax assessed against him; that the legal
holder of a county warrant is the person to whom the same is
issued as payee, or to whom the same has been transferred by
one or more assignments in full; that by law all county warrants must be made payable to a person therein named, and
no county warrant can be made payable to bearer, and any
county warrant payable to bearer is null and void."
The petition also alleged that ITarshman, for whose use the
action was brought, was the owner of two county warrants, one
for the sum of $3315.05 and the other for the sum of $6821.74,
with interest, which he had presented to the treasurer of said
county for payment and it was refused because there was no
money in the treasury out of which they could be paid. This
fact was certified on the back of the warrants, which the treasurer entered in his registry of warrants as required by the statute of Missouri. This occurred on the 18th day of March, 1879,
and the petition filed June 13, 1883, alleged that no part of
said warrants had been paid though demand had been made
for said payment. It was then alleged that Winterbottom, intending to prevent any money coming into the treasury of the
county odt of which these warrants could be paid, had, in the

HARSHIMAN v. WINTERBOTTOM.
Statement of the Case.

collection of the taxes, received other county warrants in payment, and had thus collected and given receipts to all the taxpayers for their taxes.
This action of Winterbottom, he alleged, was an unlawful
violation of his duty as collector of the county and a breach
of his official bond.

ile then described with more 'minuteness

the particulars in which this conduct was a violation of. his
official duty, alleging that by the law the collector had no
authority to receive any warrant in payment of taxes which
was not originally issued to the man who offered it in such
payment, or was regularly assigned to him, and that even such
holder could only use it to pay his own taxes. The petition
alleged a disregard of this provision of the law by the collector,
who "did, during his said term of office, unlawfully and wrongfully receive from divers and sundry persons, in payment of
taxes of said county, divers and sundry warrants of said
county, the said persons not being the legal holders thereof,
because the said warrants were in no case payable to such persons, and were in no case transferred to such persons by assignment in full, and said persons, not being entitled to pay the
same in for taxes, because no taxes were assessed or existing
against them; that said Winterbottom, upon receiving such
warrants, gave receipts discharging from further payment the'
persons against whom said taxes were so assessed and existing,
to an amount equal in each case to the amount of warrants so
received; that from the 18th day of March, 1879, to the 1st
day of March, 1881, said Winterbottom collected all the county
taxes of and in said county in warrants as aforesaid, and not
otherwise; that all the tax-payers of said county from whom
any county taxes were due during said period have received
from said Winterbottom full acquittances without the payment
of any money, and vithout any payment except in warrants
as aforesaid."
The petition then stated "that the said Winterbottom, as
required by law, once in each month during the said period,
made settlements to the clerk of. said cointy court of the
county taxes so collected by him, and delivered to the treasurer of said county the said warrants so received as aforesaid;

that the said Winterbottom, as such collector, and, the said
treasurer, at various times during the years 1879, 1880, and
1881, made settlements of their official accounts, as required
by law, with the said county court, and the said treasurer
exhibited to the said court, and filed with the clerk of said
court, all the county warrants so received by the said collector,
and by him delivered to the said treasurer, and the said county
court accepted and approved the settlements of the said collector and the said treasurer, and approved the acts of the
said collector in receiving warrants in payment of taxes, as
aforesaid, and ratified and confirmed the release and discharge
of said tax-payers from Payment of their taxes, as aforesaid,
so that the same cannot again be demanded of them."
To this petition there was a demurrer, which being sustained by the Circuit Court, judoment was rendered for the
defendants.

MR. JUSTICE MILLr., after stating the case as above reported,
delivered the opinion of the court.

We are of opinion that the action of the court was right.
While there are other reasons, perhaps, why this petition is
insufficient to sustain the action, the two principal ones are:
First, that the actual plaintiff, Harshman, for whose use this
action was brought, shows no relation of contract or legal obligation, between Winterbottom and himself, on which he has a
right to bring this suit.
Second, that the obligation of the defendants is to the State
for the collection of the state taxes, and to the county for the
collection of the county taxes. There are no state taxes 'in
the case. The county taxes were collected and paid over to
the county treasury in the class of current obligations of the
county, which the law recognizes as valid payment of taxes,
and the county court, to whom the obligation of accounting
for the taxes collected, or for failure to collect taxes, was due,
has settled with Winterbottom and accepted its own warrants
issued upon the treasurer as a full and satisfactory payment
and discharge of that obligation. This formal accounting and
settlement between the county court and the defendant, Winterbottom, as set out by the plaintiff himself in his own declaration, is one which the county court undoubtedly had a right
to make, and, in paying over these county warrants to the
treasury of the county, and in receiving the acknowledgment
of the County court that he was fully discharged from his obligations in that respect, he presents a defence to this action
which nothing in the declaration removes or invalidates. He

HARSHMAN v. WINTERBOTTOB.
Opinion of the Court.

had a right to receive county warrants in payment of taxes.
The law in express terms declares it to be his duty to receive
them. Whether they were received by him under the exact
circumstances which the law directs as to original ownership
or assignment to the party who presented them, were matters for which he might have been called to account by the
county court, and that body, in making the settlement with
him, might possibly have had the power to reject warrants so
received in madng up the account; but, inasmuch as they
were actual obligations of the county, payable out of the
county funds, and receivable in discharge of taxes if properly
tendered, the county court, which, by law, has full charge of
all the financial operations of the county, could waive any
such irregularity in the time and mode of presenting their
own obligations, and credit the collector with them in the
account.
We are of opinion that this settlement with the county court
is of itself a sufficient bar to the present action on the collector's bond. If this were not so, and if, as the )laintiff's
counsel contends, the payment of these taxes by the county
warrants thus irregularly presented is void, then the tax-payer
himself is not discharged. He had no more right to tender
the county warrants in payment of his taxes, under the circumstances mentioned in the petition, than the collector had to
receive them. If the act is a void act as to the one, it is a void
act as to the other, and the right of the plaintiff to sue the
tax-payer is much clearer than his right to sue the collector,
because the tax-payer owes his taxes yet, having never lawfully paid them, while the collector has settled his accounts
with the authority which had a right to accept these county
warrants, and has been discharged from further obligation. If
he can sue the collector on this official bond, and the sureties
who are bound with him on that bond, why can lie not sue the
tax-payers? The obligation to pay taxes, and the obligation
to pay the taxes when collected into the treasury, is the same
and bears exactly the same relation to the right of Harshman
to get his money out of the county treasury.
The truth is there is no contract or legal obligation of the

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.

collector in that matter.to Harshman. llarshman is a creditor
of the county of Knox. He has no more right to interfere
between that county and its collector as to the manner in which
that official shall discharge his duties, except perhaps in case
of fraud or conspiracy, or by way of mandamus, than he would
have as a creditor of any individual to interfere between him
and his debtors. Where such things are permitted at all it is
by way of a garnishee process or attachment, which is regulated
by statute, or by a bill in chancery. The proceeding here has
nothing of that character. The want of privity between
larshman and the obligors in the bond on which they are
sued is established by the decision of this court in. Savings
Bank v. Wizard, 100 U. S. 202.
It does not appear that if all the taxes had been paid in
money which the plaintiff alleges were erroneously paid in
warrants, that when that money was paid into the treasury
the relator would have been entitled to any of it. The discretion of the county court, and indeed its obligation to provide for the current necessities of the county, could not be
interfered with by any one to direct the payment of this
money to that particular debt. We do not see, therefore,
that he was damaged, certainly not damaged in a manner
which the law can recognize, by the collection of these taxes
in warrants instead of money. East St. Louis v. Zebley, 110
U. S. 321; Clay County v. .3fcAleer,115 U. S. 616.

OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

Argued October 19, 20, 1887. -Decided November 7,1887.

The relief prayed for in this case was the construction and maintenance of
a piece of railway in specific performance of a contract attached to the
bill as an exhibit; but upon examination it appeared that the contract
did not call for its coustruction and maintenance.
