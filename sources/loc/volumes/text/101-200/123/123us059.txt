GILSON v. DAYTON.
Statement of the Case.

GILSON v. DAYTON.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Submitted October 11, 1SS7. -Decided

October 24, 18S7.

As it appears on the face of the bonds sued on in this action that they were
issued under the special act of February 18, 1857, which was held void
in Post v. Supervisors, 105 U. S. 667, and not under the general law of
March 6, 1867, the judgment dismissing the action is affirmed.

THIS was an action to recover on twelve bonds, each for
$1000 issued by the town of Dayton. In each bond it was
stated that it was "issued in pursuance of an election or special
town meeting held in said town on the 17th day of April,
1869, under and by virtue of a certain act of the Legislature of
the State of Illinois approved February 1Sth, 1857," "authorizing municipal subscriptions to the stock of certain railroads,"
"the said act having special reference to the Ottawa, Oswego
and Fox River Valley Railroad," that a majority of the'voters
had voted in favor of their issue, "previous application in
writing of fifty legal voters of said town for such an election"
"having been made to the clerk of said town, and the said
town clerk having called said election" "in accordance therewith," "and having given due notice of the time and place of
holding the same, as required by law and by the act aforesaid."
In his declaration the plaintiff averred the making and issue
of the bonds, set out one of the bonds at length, and further
averred " that he purchased the above-mentioned bonds and
coupons in the usual course of commercial business for an
investment, paying therefor a good and valuable consideration
long before the same were due and payable, and without any
notice of any claimed defect or irregularity in their issue or
want of power to issue them, relying upon the faithful action
of the town and State officials in their issue and registration,
and upon all laws and judicial decisions in existence at the

time they were voted and issued for their validity, and especially upon the act of farch 6, 1867, found in volume 1, page
866, Private Laws of Illinois of 1867."
The defendant demurred. Demurrer sustained and the
action dismissed. Plaintiff sued out this writ of error.
The act of 1857 referred to in the bond was held by the
courts of Illinois, and by this court in Post v. Supervisor,,
105 U. S. 667, to be "of no force or effect by reason of its not
appearing by the legislative journals to have been passed as
required by the constitution of 1848." The act of 1867 referred to in the declaration was a general enabling act for the
county in which Dayton was situated, but it required the
application for the meeting to be made by "twenty legal voters
and tax payers of the district."
_31'. George A. Sanders, for plaintiff in error, contended that
although the bonds on their face purported to have been
issued under the act of 1857, yet as the act of 1867 was in
force and gave plenary power for their issue, and the averment,
in the declaration respecting them had been admitted by the
demurrer, they should be held to have been issued under the
later act; and he cited: Commissioners of JZox County v.

Syllabus.
AIR.

IIrEF JUSTICE WAITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

The judgment in this case is affirmed on the authority of
Crow v. Oxford, 119 U. S. 215. See also Post v. .Supervisors,
105 U. S. 667, 691. It appears on the face of the bonds sued
for that the subscription was made under and by virtue of
the act of February 18, 1857, and that the vote of the town
was taken at a special town meeting called upon the "application in writing of fifty legal voters of said town," which is
in accordance with the provisions of that act. The act of
March 6, 1867, which the plaintiff now claims is sufficient to
support the bonds, requires that the application for the town
meeting shall be made by "twenty votets and tax-payers."
The record does not show that any of those who signed the
application for the meeting at which the vote was taken were
tax-payers. It thus appears from the bonds themselves not
only that they were issued under the act of 1857, but that
they were not issued under that of 1867.

HENDERSON v. LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE
RAILROAD.
ERROR

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
EASTERN

TIE UNITED STATES FOR THE

DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

Argued October 21, 1887.-Decided October 31, 1887.

A railroad company is not responsible for the loss of a bag containing
money and jewelry, carried in the hand of a passenger and by him accidentally dropped through an open window in the car, although, upon
notice of the loss, it refuses to stop the train, short of Q usual station,
to enable him to recover it.
Under the practice in Louisiana, the Circuit Court of the United States,
after ordering a petition to be dismissed ds showing no cause: of action,
but with leave to file an amended petition, may, at the hearing on the
amended petition, amend the order allowing it to be filed, by providing
that it shall be treated as a mere amendment to the original petition, and
thus preclude the plaintiff from contesting a material fact, *within his
own knowledge, averred in that petition.
