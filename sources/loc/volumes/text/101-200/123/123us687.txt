TEXAS. & PACIFIC RAILWAY COPALNY
v. MARLOR.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Argued December 5, 6, 1S87.-Decided December 19, 1887.

A railroad company, in a bond issued by it, promised to pay the principal at a
specified time and place, "with interest thereon at the rate of seven per
cent per annum, payable annually on the 1st day of July in each year, as
provided in the mortgage hereinafter mentioned." The bond also set
forth, that the interest was secured by a mortgage lien on the net income
of certain specified lines of road; andthat, "in case such net earnings shall
not in any one year be sufficient to enable the company to pay seven per
cent interest on the outstanding bonds, then scrip may, at the option of
the company, be issued for the interest." A certificate on the bond, by
the mortgage trustees, stated that the bond bore "seven per cent interest per annum, payable yearly." The mortgage stated that it was given
to secure the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds "according to the tenor thereof." On July 1st, 1882 and 1883, the company
neither paid the interest in money nor declared its election to issue scrip
for the interest. Shortly after each of those days it notified the bondholders that it was not prepared to pay interest, as the earnings of the
railway were not sufficient. It took no action in reference to the issue
of scrip until October, 1883. In a suit by a bondholder who refused to
receive the scrip, to recover the interest in money: Held,
(I) If the company did not pay the interest in money by the interest
day, it was bound to exercise, by that day, its option to pay it
in scrip, and, if it did not, it became liable to the bondholders to
pay the interest in money;
(2) No demand by a bondholder was necessary. in order to entitle him to
the payment of the interest in money, on the failure of the company so to exercise such option.

JusTiVn BLATo1FoRD delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York, brought by the
Texas and Pacific Railway Company, a corporation organized
and existing under acts of the Congress of the United States,
to review a judgment entered against it by that court on the
17th of September, 18841, in favor of Henry S. Marlor, for the
sum of $23,204.99.
The suit was commenced in a court of the State of New
York, in November, 1883, and was removed into the Circuit
Court by the defendant. It was tried by that court, on filing
a written waiver of a jury, on aii agreed statement of facts,
and on the depositions of witnesses. The material facts of
the case as found by the Circuit Court, are as follows: Prior
to the first of July, 1883, the plaintiff became the owner of
150 bonds issued by the defendant, and entitled to the interest
due thereon on the first days of July in the years 1882 and
1883, according to the terms and conditions of the bonds.
Each bond was in the following form:

Opinion of the Court.

"This bond is one of a series of bonds numbered consecutively from one to eight thousand nine hundred and eight, of
the denomination of one thousand dollars each, of like tenor
and date, the payment whereof is secured by a first mortgage
of even date herewith, duly recorded, upon certain lands heretofore granted to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company,
by the State of Texas, or in which said company is in any
manner interested, being a first lien or charge upon all those
sections or fractional sections or square miles of land acquired
or to be acquired by said company in constructing its lines of
road east of Fort Worth, under or by virtue of the acts of
incorporation of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the
Southern Transcontinental Railroad Company, the Memphis,
El Paso, and Pacific Railroad Company, or of the several supplements and enactments relating thereto, or under any of
the special or general laws passed by the Legislature of the
State of Texas, and applicable to said companies, or either
of them, or to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company,
the total quantity of land to be acquired in constructing said
lines of railway under the several grants being estimateld at
or about 7,600,000 acres. This bond has also, as security for
the interest, a mortgage lien upon the net income of the said
Texas and Pacific Railway Company, derived from operating
its lines of railway east of Fort Worth, in the State of Texas,
after providing for the operating expenses the current repairs
and reconstructions, and the interest upon the first and second
mortgage bonds secured upon said lines of railway, the length
of which, constructed and to be constructed, is estimated to be
524 miles; and in case such net earnings shall not in any one
year be sufficient to enable the company to pay se'en per cent
interest on the outstanding bonds, then scrip may, at the option
of the company, be issued for the interest, such scrip to b received at par and interest, the same as money, in payment for
any of the company's lands acquired as aforesaid in Texas, at
the ordinary schedule price, or it may be converted into capital stock of the company, when presented in amounts of $100
or its multiple. The holder of this bond is entitled to the
benefit of the additional security of the sipking fund provided

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. MARLOR.

691

Opinion of the Court.

The complaint alleged that the defendant did not exercise
the option given to it by the bonds to pay the plaintiff the
interest in scrip upon the 150 bonds, which became due and
payable on July 1, 1882, or that which became due and pay-'
able on July 1, 1883, and demanded judgment for the interest
in money, with accrued interest from those days respectively.
There was no formal presentment by the plaintiff- of the
bonds in suit for the payment of interest on July 1,
1882, or on July 1, 1883, or at any other time. Shortly after
each of those days, the treasurer of the defendant, at the
defendant's office, notified the holders of the bonds, that it
was not prepared to pay interest, as the earnings of the railway were not sufficient; and no action was taken by it in reference to the issue of scrip. Before the commencement of
this suit, and induced by the -suggestion that suits were about
to be brought to recover the interest on the bonds, and on or
about October 12, 1883, the executive committee of the defendant's board of directors adopted a resolution providing for
the payment of the interest in question in scrip. Notice of this
action on the part of the defendant was given to the plaintiff
and to the bondholders generally, by publication, before this suit
was brought, and the defendant notified the plaintiff of its
willingness to deliver to him his scrip for the interest in suit,
and tendered it to him at the trial, but he refused to receive it.
On the 29th of March, 1875, the defendant had outstanding
9252 land-grant bonds, secured by a first mortgage upon all
the lands in the State of Texas which it had acquired, or
might thereafter acquire, by virtue of its consolidation with the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and the Southern Transcontinental Railway Company, or by virtue of its consolidation with, or purchase of, any other railroad company in the
State of Texas, under the authority of the acts of Congress of
March 3, 1871, and May 2, 1872; also, certain construction
bonds, secured by a first mortgage upon its lines of railway and
their appurtenances east of Fort Worth in the State of Texas.
Those land-grant bonds and construction bonds were fixed
obligations, with coupons for semiannual interest, and the
mortgages which secured them contained provisions for fore-

closure, in case of default in'the paymnent of such interest. On
the 29th of M\farch, 1875, the road of the defendant was only
partially completed to Fort Worth, about 325 miles of it being
then built and in operation. The defendant had made default
in paying the interest on the bonds above mentioned. On
that day the stockholders met, and passed the following resolution: "Resolved, That the board of directors shall be, and
they are hereby requested and fully authorized and empowered
to provide for and to issue eighty-nine hundred and eight
(8908) income and land-grant bonds, each for the sum of one
thousand dollars, bearing seven per cent interest, the interest
and the principal of said bonds to be payable in United States
currency, and said bonds tW mature in forty years from their
date, and to secure the payment of the interest and the principal of said bonds by a first mortgage upon all the lands heretofore granted to this 6ompauy, or in which this company in
said State is in any manner interested, being a first lien or
charge upon all those sections or parts of sections or square
miles of land acquired by the Texas and Pacific Railroad Company, or to be acquired by said company, in constructing its lines
of road east of 'Fort Worth, under or by virtue of the acts of incorporation of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the
Southern Transcontinental Railway Company, the MhIemphis, El
Paso and Pacific Railroad Company, or of the several supplements and amendments relating thereto, or under any of the
special or general laws passed by the Legislature of the State of
Texas, and applicable to said companies, or either of them, or to
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, the total quantity of
land so to be acquired, in constructing said lines of railway,
being estimated at about 7,600,000 acres; and said mortgage
or deed of trust shall also include the net income of the company from the operating of its lines east of Fort Worth, after
providing for the operating expenses, the current repairs and
.reconstructions, and the interest on tht first and second mortgages hereinbefore provided for; and there shall be included
in said mortgage or deed of trust a provision for a sinking
fund out of the net proceeds of sales of land, and by the receiving of said bonds in payment for purchases of lands

covered by the mortgage. The bonds thus provided for
shall be exchangeable for outstanding land-grant bonds, and
ftsed in purchase of material and supplies and for construction
work, or may be applied toward the payment of any of the
company's indebtedness or obligations."
In pursuance of the authority thus conferred, the board of
directors of the defendant issued 8857 income and land-grant
bonds, in the form of the one above set forth, and executed a
mortgage to secure them, dated May 15, 1875, and a supplemental mortgage dated March 23, 1876, each to Walters and
Krumbhaar, as trustees. The mortgage of May 15, 1875,
recites the foregoing resolution, and sets out a form of the
bond and of the certificate of the trustees, and then states
that, "in order to secure the payment of the principal and
interest" of the 8908 bonds, ".according to the tenor thereof,"
the company conveys to the trustees "all th lands heretofore
granted to this company, or in which this company in the
State of Texas is in any manner interested, being all those
sections or parts of sections or square miles of land acquired by
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, or to be acquired
by said company, in constructing its lines of road east of Fort
Worth, in the State of Texas, under or by virtue of the acts
of incorporation of the Southern Pacific IRailroad Company,
the Southern Transcontinental Railroad Company, the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad Company, or of the several
supplements -and amendments relating thereto, or under any
of the special or general laws passed by the Legislature of the
State of Texas, and applicable to said companies or either of
them, or to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, the total
quantity of lands so to be acquired in. constructing said lines
of railway being estimated at about 7,600,000 acres of land;
also all the net income of the lines of railway and appurtenances of the said The Texas and Pacific Railway Company

and twenty-four miles of railroad nearly completed, after

State of Louisiana, to a connection with the line of railroad of

between Louisiana and Texas."
The mortgage further provided, that no bonds should be
issued until at least $2,251,000 of the outstanding land-grant
bonds theretofore issued should be deposited with the trustees
and registered in their names, to be held as additional security
for the bonds to be issued under the m6rtgage, until all the
land-grant bonds should have be,)n so deposited or retired by
the company, and the mortgage cnder which they were issued
satisfied of record, the holders of any outstanding land-grant
bonds to have the right, until January 1, 1876, to exchange
their bonds, with accrued interest, at par, for the bonds issued
under the new mortgage, the bonds so received in exchange to
be registered and held by the trustees as additional security,
as before provided, and, after January 1, 1876, the remainder
of the bonds under the new mortgage to be disposed of as the
board of directors might determine. The mortgage also provided for giving to the trustees lists and maps of the lands
mortgaged, with minimum prices of sale, to be approved by
both parties; and it contained sundry provisions for the sale
of the lands, the purchase money to be received by the trus-

tees, subjent to the right :of purchasers to pay for the lands
with the bonds issued under the mortgage. Out of the proceeds of the sales of the lands, the expenses of the land department, and compensation for the services and expenses of the
trustees, were to be paid, and the balance was to be dppropriated to a sinking fund to redeem the bonds. Provision was
made for applying the sinking fund yearly to purchasing the
bonds at or less than par, or, if that could not be done, to
redeeming bonds designated by lot; also, for the sale of the
lands to pay the l)rincipal of the bonds, and for the termination
of the trust on the payment in full of the bonds and interest.
The supplemental mortgage of the 23d of March, 1876, conveyed to the trustees, subject to the trust created by the mortgage of M[ay 15, 1875, ': the lines of railway and appurtenances

under and subject, neverthieless, to the lien and charge of prior
encumbrances thereon, and subject to all the trusts, limitations,
conditions, and provisions of every kind mentioned and set
forth in the deed of trust dated May 15th, 1875, whereto this
instrument of writing is supplementary."
Subsequently to January 1, 1876, as of which date the first
instahnent of the income and land-grant bonds was issued, and
in the years or interest periods ending respe~tively on the first
days of July, 1877, 1878, and 1879, the net earnings of the
company, as defined in the bonds and mortgage, were insufficient to enable it to pay the interest on the bonds outstanding
at those dates, and, throughout those years or interest periods,
no interest was paid upon the bonds nor any scrip issued for
the interest or any part of it. On the 16th of February, 1880,
in pursuance of a resolution of the board of directors, the
defendant issued scrip for the interest accumulated during the
entire period included between the 1st of January, 1876; and
the. 1st of July, 1879. The net earnings of the road having
been insufficient to enable the defendant to pay the interest on
the bonds for the years ending July 1, 1880, and July 1, 1881,
it issued scrip for the interest for those years respectively. For
the year ending July 1, 1882, there was a deficit of $195,076.17
in the earnings of the road; and for the year ending. July 1,
1883, there were surplus earnings of $131,867.90; thus showing a net deficit, for the operations of those two years, of
$63,208.27. The fact that the net earnings of those two years
were insufficient to dnable the defendant to pay the interest on
the income and land-grant bonds as provided therein was
promptly made known and declared by it to its bondholders
and the plaintiff had due notice tbereof.
The income and land-grant bonds are registered obligations.
Interest on them is payable only to registered holders, or their
assignees by duly executed and acknowledged or authenticated
order or assignment, at tha office of the defendant, and upon
the delivery by such holders, or such assignees, of receipts for
the interest, or, in case scrip is issued, of receipts for the scrip.
By uniform practice, from the first issue of scrip, the bonds,
or such orders or assignments, are presented by the payee or

Opinion of the Court.

registered holder, or such assignee, at the office bf the defendant, for scrip. When scrip is delivered, no endorsement is
'made on the bond, but the receipt or voucher for the scrip is
signed by the person receiving it, and the defendant cannot
know to whom to issue or deliver scrip, or who is entitled
thereto, or who will receive the same, until the bonds, or such
assignments or orders, are presented at its office and scrip
demanded, or unl~ss the registered, holder, properly identified,
presents himself at the office of the defendant and demands
the issue of the scrip. The plaintiff, in respect of the interest
sued for in this suit, never presented the bonds and demanded
the issue of the scrip for the years 1882 and 1883.
. On the foregoing facts, the Circuit Court found, as conclusions of law, that the defendant failed to exercise its option to
pay the plaintiff the interest in scrip due on the 1st of July,
1882, and that due on the 1st of July, 1883, on the 150 bonds;
and that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the two
sums of $10,500 each, with interest on one from the 1st of
July, 1882, and interest on the other from the 1st of July.
1883.
The opinion of the Circuit Court, which accompanies the
record, and is reported in 22 Blatchford, 464, proceeded upon
the view, that there was nothing in the language of the mortgage which controlled or qualified the absolute promise in the
bond to pay interest in money or in scrip; that the bond contained a promise to pay interest annually; that there was
nothing in it to show that the o'vner was not to have his
interest, or scrip instead, at the election of the defendant, if
the net earnings of the railway were not sufficient to pay the
interest; that the plaintiff was entitled to his money, or the
scrip as its substitute, on the day on which, by the terms of
the bond, the defendant was to pay the interest or exercise
the alternative; that there was no reservation, in terms or by
implication, of a right in the defendant to exercise the option
after the day of payment; that, that day having elapsed without an election by the defendant, the bondholder was entitled
to be paid his interest in money; and that it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to present the bonds for the payment of

OCTOBER TERAI,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

interest on the day it fell due, or to then demand the payment
of interest, as a prerequisite to his right of action to recover
the interest money.
It is contended, for the defendant, that the bond in question is an income bond, in the sense that the interest on it is
not payable in money on the first day of July in each year,
unless net earnings, as defined in the bond and the mortgage,
have been made; that, if sufficient net earnings, as thus defined, have not been acquired during the year, then, unless the
company exercises its option to issue scrip, the interpst accumulates until it is earned, or until it is paid out of the sinking
fund created by the sale of the mortgaged lands, or until the
bond with its accrued interest becomes due; that the effect of
a failure to exercise the option on the interest day is not to
create a present fixed obligation to pay the interest in money;
that, in any event, the option to pay in scrip need not be exercised on or by the interest day, but it is sufficient if the scrip
is ready for the bondholder when he demands it; and that the
effect of any default to pay in scrip is not to make the defendant liable for the full amount of the interest, but only for
the value of the scrip at the time of default.
We are of opinion, however, that the Circuit Gourt was
correct in its construction of the contract between the parties.
Much stress is laid by the defendant upon the fact that the
bond, 'on its face, is called a "seven per cent income and landgrant boifd;" and from this the argument is deduced that the
interest is payable' only out of income. But the expression
"income and land-grant bond" is sufficiently justified and
satisfied by the fact that the mortgage states that the principal and interest of the bonds are secured by a mortgage upon
the land acquired, or to be acquired by the company, under
the statutes specified in the mortgage, and upon the net
income of the lines of its railway east of Fort Worth. The
mortgage states, that it is given to secure 8908 income and
land-grant bonds, each for $1000, bearing seven per cent
interest, the interest and the principal of the bonds to be payable in United States currency, (as distinguished from two
other classes of bonds authorized at the same time, which

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. MARLOR.

699

Opinion of the Court.

were to be payable in gold coin). The resolution of the
stockholders authorizing the issuing of the bonds was to the
same effect. The option to pay the interest in sciip was not
expressed in the resolution of the stockholders, but the mortgage states that the principal and interest of the bonds are to
be paid "according to the tenor thereof." The-bond contains
a liromise to pay the $1000 on the 1st of January, 1915, in
lawful money of the United States, "with interest thereon at
the rate of seven per cent per annum, payable annually on
the first day of July in each year, as provided in the mort:gage hereinafter mintioned." The words "as provided in the
mortgage hereinafter mentioned" refer to the payment of the
principal as well as the interest.
There is thus far ai absolute obligation and promise to pay
the interest on the first day of July in each year. How is
that promise qualified subsequently in the bond? Only by
the provision, that, in case the net earnings derived from
operating the lines of railway east of Fort Worth shall not
in any one year be sufficient to enable the company to pay
seven per cent interest on the outstanding bonds, then. scrip
may, at the option of the company, be issued for the interest.
The only alternative to the payment of the interest in money
on-the-day named is that, if the net earnings in the year shall
not be sufficient to enable the company to pay the interest on
the outstanding bonds, it may elect to issue scrip for the
interest; but the scrip is to be issued, if issued, as and for the
unpaid interest; and it is Iain that the option of the company
to issue the scrip must be exercised at the time when, but for
'the insufficiency of the net eainings, it Would be, required to
pay the interest in money.. If the option be thus exercisedi
reasonable time may be allowed to prepare the scrip and issue
and deliver it; but, as the scrip is to be received at par and
interest, the same as money, in payment for the lands, or for
conversion into the capital stock of the company, it is necessarily to draw interest from the day on which the interest
which it takes the place of was payable.
In the absence of an exercise of the option, on the day the
interest was due, to pay it in scrip, the bondholder had an

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

immediate right of action for the interest money. The security given by the mortgage upon the lands and upon the net
income is entirely separate and apart from the obligation of
the company to pay the interest in money or in scrip. This
last provision is one for the benefit of the company, to enable
it to retain in its treasury the net earnings derived from operating its lines east of Fort Worth, if such earnings do not
amount in the year to enough to enable it to pay the full
interest on the outstanding bonds; but, in such case, it must
exercise its option, by the day the interest falls due, to give to
its bondholders, for such interest, scrip for the full amount
thereof. The contract cannot be construed so as to make it
possible for the company to retain all its net earnings, however little under seven per cent on the amount of the outstanding bonds, and yet withhold from the bondholders the
scrip, as the representative of the full interest promised to be
paid. We do not, however, mean to suggest that the company may not pay the net earnings in money for part of the
interest, and pay the rest in scrip.
1By the mortgage, all the net income from the lines east of
Fort Worth was pledged to secure the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds "according to the tenor thereof;"
and the bond states that it is secured y a mortgage lien upon
such net income, "as security for the interest." The fact that
the bond also states, on its face, that it will be received by the
company "at par and accrued interest," in payment or exchange for any lands covered by the mortgage, serves to confirn the construction above given. * So, also, the certificate of
the trustees on each bond states that the bonds bear seven per
cent interest per annum, payable yearly.
It is contended for the defendant., that it cannot ascertain
by the interest day whether the net earnings for the year are
sufficient to pay the interest in money, and that hence it cannot exercise its option, by the interest day, to pay the interest
in scrip. It is a sufficient answer to this position to say that
the contract it has made is that it will exercise the option by
that day. Furthermore, it is found.i.hat the fact that the net
earnings of the two years ending July 1st, 1882, and July 1st,

Opinion of the Court.

1883, were insuffcient to enable the defendant to pay the
interest, was promptly made known by it to the bondholders;,
and it is not found that it could not have sufficiently ascertained such fact by the interest day to enable it to exercise the
reserved option.
It is urged for the defendant that, because it did not pay
interest or issue scrip therefor, for the interest peri6ds ending
July 1, 1877, 1878, and 1879, but issued scrip in February,
1880, for the interest accumulated for the period between January 1, 1876, and July 1, 1879, a practical construction -was
put by the bondholders upon the contract, which cannot be
regarded as merely a forbearance, or a waiver for the time
being, of their rights under the contract. But it is also found
as a fact, by the Circuit Court, that the net earnings of the
road having been insufficient to enable the company to pay the
interest on the bonds for the years ending July 1, 1880, and
July 1, 1881, itissued scrip for the interest for those years
respectively. We see nothing, in all these facts, which
amounts to a waiver which can affect or prejudice the right
asserted by the present plaintiff in this suit.
We are also of opinion that no demand by the plaintiff was necessary, to entitle him to the payment of the
interest in money, on the failure of the defendant to exercise
its option, on the day the interest fell due, to issue scrip
therefor. It is stated in the findings of the Circuit Court,
that shortly after the 1st of July, 1882, and shortly after
the 1st of July, 1883, the treasurer of the defendant, at its
office, notified the holders of its bonds that it was not prepared
to pay the interest, as the earnings of the railway were not
sufficient; and no action was taken by it in reference to the
issue of scrip. This shows that it did not on the proper days
elect to issue scrip. The bond states that the scrip, if issued,
is to be issued "for the interest," that is, in place of the interest, and, under the terms of the bond, the pompany was bound
to pay the interest on the day it was due, or else to issue the
scrip, on the failure of a sufficiency of net earnings to pay the
full intekest. There was, therefore, no obligation on the part
of the bondholder to demand his interest in money, in order

to perfect his right to recover it, in the absence of the exercise
of an option by the company, on the day the interest fell due,
to pay it in scrip. lHe had no right, by the terms of the
contract, to demand the scrip. It was for the company to
announce its election to pay in scrip, or, as it did, take no
action in reference to the issue of scrip. In the absence of an
election by the company, on the day the interest fell due, to
issue the scrip, the right of action of the plaintiff immediately
came into existence, without any demand on his part, to recover
the full amount of the interest mentioned in the bond.
The cases cited by the defendant on the question of damages
do not apply to an a.lternative contract like that in the present
case. It falls within those cases in which, if the contract be
that the promisor shall do one of two things by a certain day,
at his election, he cannot exercise his election after the day
has passed. This is familiar law, and needs no citation of
authorities.

OF

THE

UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MAINE.
Argued December 7, 1887.-

Decided December 19,1887.

In construing doubtful clauses in a will, the court will endeavor to ascertain the testator's intention through their meaning as reasonably interpreted in the particular case, rather than resort to formal rules, or to a
consideration of judicial determination in other cases, apparently similar.
The testator in this case provided in his will that his widow should have
the income of all his estate, she having the right to spend it, but not to
have it accumulate for her heirs; that his two sisters if living at the
time of the death of himself and his wife, or the one that might then be
living, should " have the incomaof all my estate as long as they may live,
and at their death to be divided in three parts, one-third of the income to
go to" a charitable institution, one-third to another institution, and one-.
third to another. Both sisters died before the testator. Held, that 'the
