delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error brought for the review of au order of
a Circuit Court, remanding a suit which had been removed
from a state court. The suit was begun October 28, 1885;
removed October 30, 1885, the state court making an order to
that effect on that day; and remanded by the Circuit Court,
May 4, 1886. All this was before the act of -March 3, 1887, c.
373, _4 Stat. 552, wut into effect. The writ of error from
this court was not sued out, however, until April 8, 1887,
which was after that statute.
The first question which presents itself is, whether we have
jurisdiction of the writ. We have already decided, at the
present term, in Jforey v. Lockhliart, ante, 56, that this court
cannot review, on appeal or writ of error,.the order of a Circuit Court, remanding a suit which had been removed under
the act of 1887 and which was begun, removed, and remanded
after that act went into effect. Later in the term we decided,
Wilk-inson v. Yebraska, ante, 2.6, that we had nio jurisdiction
when the suit was begun and removed before the act of 1887,

Opinion of the Court.

but not remanded until afterwards. In the last case we said
"that this statute showed "unmistakably an intention on the
part of Congress to take away all appeals and writs of error
to this court from orders thereafter made by Circuit Courts
remanding suits which had been removed from a state court,
and this whether the suit was begun and the removal had before or after the act of 1887." That was as far as it was necessary to go in any suit that had come before us down to thattime. Here, however, the question reaches one step further,
and requires us to determine whether we can take jurisdiction
on appeal or writ of error if the order to remand was made
whilst the act of March 3,1875, c. 137,18 Stat. 470, was in force,
but the writ of error was not brought until after t hat of March
3, 1887, went into effect, and we are of opinion that we cannot. This is the logical result of what has already been
.decided. Until the act of 1875 there was no such jurisdiction.
Railroad Co. v.- Wiswall, 23 Wall. 507. The provision of that
act giving the jurisdiction was repealed by the act of 1887
without any reservation as to pending cases, the proviso in the
repealing section having reference "only to the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court and the disposition of the suit on its merits."
T ilkinsor,v. -NeSraska,ubi supra. As a consequence of this
the repeal operated to take away jurisdiction in cases where
the order to remand had been made, but no appeal or writ of
error taken, because "if a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed
without a reservation as to pending cases, all such cases fall
with the law." Railroad Co. v. Grant, 98 U. S. 398, 401, and
cases there cited.
It follows that we have no jurisdiction of this writ of error,
and it is accordingly
Dismissed.
