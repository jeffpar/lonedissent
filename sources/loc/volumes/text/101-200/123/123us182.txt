OCTOBER TEI9M,

1887.

Statement of the Case.

Fielden-Spies having been born in Germany and Fielden in
Great Britain-that they have been denied by the decision of
the court below rights guaranteed to them by treaties between
the United States and their respective countries, it is sufficient
to say that no such questions were made and decided in either
of the courts below, and they cannot be raised in this court
for the first time. Besides, we have not been referred to any
treaty, neither are we aware of any, under which such a question could be raised.
The objection that the defendants were not actually present
in the Supreme Court of the State at the time sentence was
pronounced cannot be made on the record as it now stands,
because on its face it shows that they were present. If this is
not in accordance with the fact, the record must be corrected
below, not here. It will be time enough to consider whether
the objection presents a Federal question when the correction
has been made.
Being of opinion, therefore, that the Federal questions presented by the counsel for the petitioners, and which they say
they desire to argue, are not involved in the determination of
the case as it appears on the face of the record, we deny the
writ.
Petition,for writ of error is dismissed.

THIS was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims.
The case as stated by the court was as follows.

MATHEWS v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

This suit was brought by the appellant to recover from the
United States the balance claimed to be Uue him on account
of salary as consul of the United States at Tangier, in the
Barbary States, from July 1, 1882, to June 30, 1886. He entered upon the duties of that office July 19, 1870 ; was paid at
the rate of three thousand dollars per annum upto June 30,
1882; and, thereafter, only at the rate of two thousand dollars
per annum. He claims that he was entitled to receive the
larger sum during the entire period of his service. The
Court of Claims, being of opinion that the claimant had no
cause of action, dismissed the petition.
The act of August 18, 1856, regulating the diplomatic
and consular systems of the United States, contained this
provision: "That consuls-general, consuls and commercial
agents appointed to the ports and places hereinafter specified
in schedules B and C shall be entitled to compensation for
their services, respectively, at the rates per annum hereinafter specified in schedules B and C. . .
Schedule B.
I. Consuls-General. .
.
II. Consuls.
.
. Barbary
States; Tangier, Tripoli and Tunis, each three thousand
dollars." 11 Stat. 52, 54.
The same provision was carried into the Revised Statutes,

1690.
The act of June 11, 1874, making appropriations for the
diplomatic and consular service for the year ending June 30,
1875, 18 Stat. 66, contained this provision: "That schedules
B and C in section three of the act entitled 'An act to regulate the diplomatic and consular systems of the United States,'
approved August eighteenth, eighteen hundred and fifty-six,
shall, from and after the first day of July next, read as follows: ' Schedule B. . . . The following consulates shall be
divided into seven classes, to be.known, respectively, as lasses
one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven, and the consuls at
such consulates shall each be entitled to compensation for their
services per annum at the rates respectively specified herein, to
wit: Class-one, four thousand dollars. Class two, three thou,
sand five hundred dollars. Class three, three thousand dollars.
Class four, two thousand five hundred dollars. Class five, two

thousand dollars. Class six, one thousand five hundred dollars.
Class seven, one thousand dollars. . . . Class 1II.
Barbary States: Tripoli, Tunis, Tangier."
The diplomatic and consular appropriation act for the year
ending June 30, 1876, 18 Stat. 321, 322, appropriated "for
consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, commercial agents, and
thirteen consular clerks, thtee hundred and thirty-three
thousand two hundred dollars, namely:

.

Class III.

Barbary States: Tripoli, Tunis, Tangier." The effect of this
act was to leave the annual salaries of these officers as fixed
by the act of June 11, 1874. The appropriation acts for the
years ending June 30, 1877, and June 30, 1878, made no
change. 19 Stat. 170, 233.
But that of June 4, 1878, provides: "That the following
gums be, and the same are hereby, appropriated for the service
of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the object hereinafter expressed, namely: . . . 'For salaries of consuls,
vice-consuls, commercial agents, and thirteen consular clerks,
$304,600, namely: . . . Class III, at $3000 per annum.
Barbary States: Tripoli, Tunis, Tangier' . . . And the sal-

aries provided in this act for the officers within named respectively shall be in full for the annual salaries thereof from and
after the first day of July, eighteen hundred and seventy-eight,
and all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions
of this act are hereby repealed." 20 Stat. 91, 93, 98.
The appropriation act for the year ending June 30, 1880,
was the same as that for the previous year. 20 Stat. 267.
Those for the years ending June 30, 1881, and June 30, 1882,
also appropriated an aggregate sum for consuls, vice-consuls,
and commercial agents, keeping the consul at Tangier in
"Class III, at $3000 per annum," omitting, however, the
provision -first put into the appropriation act for the year
ending June 30, 1879, and repeated in the act for the year
ending June 30, 1880 -to the effect that the salaries for the
officers therein respectively provided for, "shall be in full for
the annual salaries thereof from and after the 1st day of July,
1878." 21 Stat. 133i 135, 339, 341. But the act making

Opinion of the Court.

appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1883, placed the
office of consul at Tangier in the F'ifth class. Congress appropriated by that act, "for salaries of consuls, vice-consuls, commercial agents, and thirteen consular clerks, $332,100, namely:
Class V. at $2000 per annum.
Barbary
States: Tangier." 22 Stat. 128, 129, 131. Each of the
appropriation acts for subsequent years, covering the period
here in question, contained the same language, keeping the
office of consul at Tangier in "Class V, at $2000 per annum,"
and differing from the former acts only as to the aggregate
amount appropriated for consuls, vice-consuls, commercial
agents, and consular clerks; except, that the act of March 3,
1887, contained the additional clause, that the sums thereby
severally appropriated were to be "in full compensation for
the diplomatic and consular service of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1888." 22 Stat. 424 ; 23 Stat. 227, 322; 24: Stat. 112,

TVation for

MR, JusTE tARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.

There is no foundation for appellant's claim. In United
States v. Langston, 118 U. S. 389, 394, we said, that "a statute
fixing the annual salary of a public officer at a named sum,
without limitation as to time, should not be deemed abrogated
or suspended by subsequent enactments which merely appropriated a less amount for the services of that officer for particular fiscal years, and which contained no words that expressly,
or by clear implication, modified or repealed the previous law."
The present case does not come within that rule; for the
consular appropriation acts for the fiscal years ending June
30, 1883, 1884, 1885, and 1886, while recognizing the division
made by the act of 1874 of consulates into classes, put the
office of consul at Tangier in "Class V, at $2000 per annum."

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

In other words, during the whole period covered by the claim
in suit, the consul at Tangier was in the fifth class, and there
was in force an act of Congress declaring that consuls of that
class should receive $2000 per annum; in other words, that
sum should be in full compensation for his services each year.
The only possible object of transferring the office of consul at
Tangier from the third to the fifth class was to reduce the
annual salary of that officer to the sum fixed for the annual
salaries of consuls of the latter class. The error in the argument in behalf of the appellant is, that he gives no effect
whatever to the words "at $2000 per annum," to be found
in every appropriation act covering the period in question.
But, clearly, those acts, placing this consul in the fifth class,
at $2000 per annum, repealed, by necessary implication, so
much of previous enactments, including that of June 11, 1874,
as placed the consul at Tangier in the third class, at $3000
per annum. The argument to the contrary is not at all aided
by.the circumstance that the diplomatic and consular appropriation act of March 3, 1887, for the first time after the passage of the act of June 11, 1874, expressly declared that the
stums thereby appropriated should be "in full compensation"
for the services therein mentioned. That act was passed after
the decision in Langston's case, and the words "in full compensation" were introduced therein, out of abundant caution,
to preclude any doubt in the future as to the intention of
Congress.
Judgment affirmed.
