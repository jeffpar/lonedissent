Under that clause in the act of March 3, 1883, 22.Stat. 473, which provides

service "had been continuous, and in the regular Navy in the lowest grade,
having graduated pay held by" him "since last entering the service,"
officers are entitled to be credited as of the lowest grade with graduated
pay held by them *afterreentering the service, and not as of a still lower
grade in which they may actually have served, but to which no graduated
pay Was attached when the act of July 15, 1870, took effect.

The. appellee Rockwell served in the volunteer Navy as acting master from July 15, 1862, to December 16, 1862; as lieutenant from December 16, 1862, to April 29; 1865; as lieutenant-commander from April 29, 1865, to December 8, 1865, when
he was honorably discharged; and as acting master from November 19, 1866, to March 12, 1868 ;' in the regular Navy, as
master from 'March 12, 1868, to December 18, 1868; as lieutenant from December 18, 1868, to February 26, 1878; and as
lieutenant-commander from February 26, 1878, to March 3,
1883. He was paid for his services in those several positions in
accordance with the lawsoin force at the time thdy were performed. But he claims, in this action, additional pay under
the act of M arch 3,1883, making appropriations for the naval
service for the year ending June 30, 1884. 22 Stat. 472, 473,
c. 97. He obtained judgment, and upo-4 this appeal the government questions the construction placed by the court below
upon that act.

UNITED STATES v. ROCKgWELL.
Opinioi of the Court.

-

The act of August 5, 1882; making appropriations for the
naval service for the year ejidingJune 30, 1883, and fdr other
purposes, provides: "IAid all officers of the navy shall be
credited with the actual Iimi. thoy may have served as officers
or enlisted men in the reglax or volunteer navy, or both, and
shall receive all the benefits of' such actual service in all respects in the same manner ds if all gaid service had been continuous, and in the regular navy: 'Provided,that nothing in
this clause shall be so construed as -.to authorize aniy change
in the dates of commission or in the relative rank of such officers." 22 Stat.,284, 287, c. 391.
Very soon after the passage of that act it became necessary
for the Second Comptroller of the Treasury to determine, for
his office, its full sc6pe and-effect.. One James Nash had been
appointed a boatswain in the regular navy on the 7th of May,
1867. Prior to ihatlme, from July 30, 1862, to April 16,
1866, he served as -msters mate and acting gunner. le
claimed, under the act of August 5, 1882, that, in ascertaining
his rate of' pay as boatswain, he should be credited with his
former services as master's mate and acting gunner. As the
pay of boatswain, prior to August -5,1882, was fixed by the
Revised Statutes (ยง 1556) at certain rates "during the first
three years after date of appointment," and at certain other
designated rates'during the second, third, and fourth "three
years after such date," the Second Comptroller was of opinion
the services performed by Nash, in any other capacity
ti.dt
than that of boatswain, could not be counted in determining
his rate of pay eyen had such services been continuous and in
the regular navy. -And since that act provided that officers
should receive the credit and the benefit of services, "in all
respects in the same manner as if all said services had been
continuous and in the regular navy," that -officer held that to
credit Nash with th6 time of his service as master's mate and
acting gunner would be inconsistent with those provisions of
the statute fixing the salary of officers, and making the rate
of pay dependent on the period of service in their particular
grad~s. Senate Ex. Doc. 107, 48th Cong., 1st Session.
After this interpretation of the act of 1882, Congress, in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

Naval Appropriation Act of March 3, 1883, modified, in some
degree, the principle upon which officers of the navy should
be credited with -the time they served in the volunteer arny
and navy. The latter act provides (the additions to the act of
1882 being shown by italics) that "all officers of the navy
shall be credited.ith the actual time they may have served
as officers or enlisted men in the regular or volunteer army or
navy, or both, and shall receive all the benefits of such actual
service, in all respects, in the same manner -as if all said service
had been continuous and in the regular navy in the lowest
grade having graduatedpay held by such oftcer since last entering the service: Provided, that nothing in this clause shall be
so coinstrued as to authorize any change in the dates of commission or in the relative rank of such officers: .Providedfur.ther, that nothing herein containedshall be so construed as to
give any additionalpay to any &uhoficer during the time of
his service in the volunteer army or/navy." 22 Stat. 473, c. 97.
While Congress did not, by the last act, give an officer
in the regular navy additional pay "during the time of his
service in the volunteer army or navy," it did give him the
benefit of previous service in either, as if all of such service
had been continuously rendered in the regular navy "in the
lowest grade having graduated pay held ,bysuch officer since
last entering thq service." What, within the meaning of. the
statute, was the lowest giade having graduated pay held by
Rockwell after he last entered the service?. iHe reentered the
service as master in the regular navy on March 12, 1868. lie
was promoted to the position of lieutenant on December 16,.
1868. The positions of master and lieutenant did not, at either
of those dates, have "graduated pay" attached to them. Their
annual compensation was fixed by statute, and was not, during
the period of his service as master, or'when he became a lieutenant in the regular navy, subject to be increased by length
of previous service in any particular grade. But, by the act of'
July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 321, 330, c. 295, now ยง 1556 Rev. Stat.,
the pay for lieutenants and masters in the navy was graduated
according to length of -service in such positions. Under that
act, the salary of a lieutenant, during the first five years after

UNITED STATES v. ROCKWELL.
Opinion of the Court.

date of commission, when at sea, is $2400; when on shore
duty, $2000; and when on leave or waiting orders, $1600.
Masters, during the-first five years from date of commission,
are allcwed annually, when at sea, $1800; when on shore d-ty,
$1500; and when on leave or waiting orders, $1200. In the
case of each of those officers this annual salary, after the expiration of the first five years, is increased by $200.for the different kinds of service performed.,
When the act of Tuly 15, 1870, took effect, Rockwell still'
held the position of lieutenant. But at the passage of the act
of March 3, 1883, he was lieutenant-commander, the pay of
which position was likewise graduated, by the act of 1870,
according to length of service. It thus appears that when the
rule of graduated pay was applied by the act of 1870 to lieutenants, masters, and other officers of the navy, Rockwell held
the position of lieutenant. That was not the lowest grade held
by him after "last entering the service ; V but it was the lowest
held by him after the pay of officers of the navy was graduated by the act of 1870 according to length of service. In
other words, it was the lowest position held bSy him after that
act took effect. It seems to the court clear that the actual
time of appellee's previous service must be cridited to the
grade of lieutenant - that being the lowest grade held by
him after the act of 1870 took effect, having graduated pay
attached to- it by that act -and not to the grade of master,
which, although the lowest held by him after last entering the
service, was not graduated, in respect to pay, until after he
had ceased to'hold it. Such we u-nderstand to be the view.
taken by the court below. That interpretation of the statute
meets our approval, and the judgment is
