HAMMOND v. JOHNSTON.
Statement of the Case.

HA

MOIND v. JOHNSTON.

ERROR TO THE SUPREIMRE COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 114. Argued November 25, 30, 1891.-Decided December 14,1891.

In an action of ejectment in a state court in Missouri, both parties claimed
under the New Madrid act, February 17, 1815, 3 Stat. 211, c. 45. In 1818
one Hammond entered on the premises, and occupied it until about 1825,
claiming title from one Hunot, whose claim, under a Spanish grant, was
confirmed by Congress, April 29, 1816, 3 Stat. 328, c. 159. The plaintiffs
claimed as heirs of Hammond. The defendant claimed under an execution sale on a judgment obtained in a state court against Hammond in
1823, under which possession had been taken and maintained. This was
fortified by a patent issued, in 1859, to Hunot, or his legal representatives. At the trial of the action in the state court, it was held that,
although the legal title to the tract in disputp was in the United States at
the time of the sale under the execution, yet Hammond had an equitable
interest in it, which was subject to sale under execution, and that, undef
the statutes of Missouri, the sheriff's deed passed all his interest in the
premises to the purchaser. Some Federal questions were also raised
and decided adversely to the plaintiffs. Judgment being rendered for
the defendant, the plaintiffs sued out this writ of error. Held, that this
ruling of the state court involved no Federal question, and was broad
enough to maintain the judgment, without considering the Federal questions raised, and that the writ of error must, therefore, be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction, -following Hopkins v. .lcLure, 133 U. S. 380;
Hale v. Akers, 132 U. S. 554; and Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson
City, 141 U. S. 679.
THE court stated the case as follows:

This was an action of ejectment, for a lot described, brought
in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, June 15, 1874.
The facts necessary to be considered in the disposition of the
case are as follows: Joseph Runot claimed a head right of 800
arpents of land, under the Spanish government, dated in 1802,
and located in what is now New Madrid County, Missouri.
On May 12,1810, he conveyed this land by warranty deed to
Joseph Vandenbenden, and on November 4, 1815, Yandenbenden conveyed the same by a like deed to Rufus Easton. January 31, 1811, the claim was presented for confirmation to the

old board of commissioners and rejected; but on November 1,
1815, Recorder Bates recommended the claim for 640 acres for
confirmation, and it was confirmed by act of Congress of
April 29, 1816, 3 Stat. 328, c. 159. August 12, 1816, Recorder
Bates issued a certificate, No. 161, stating that the tract had
been materially injured by earthquakes, and that under the
act of Congress of February 17, 1815, 3 Stat. 211, c. 45,
Joseph Hunot, or his legal representatives, (who had already
received a certificate for 160 acres,) were entitled to locate 480
acres of land on any of the public lands of the Territory of
Missouri, the sale of which was authorized by law. On June
16, 1818, Rufus Easton made application to the surveyor general to locate the said certificate on certain lands in township
45, range 7 east, being the same on which it was subsequently
located. June 23, 1819; Joseph C. Brown, United States
deputy surveyor, returned to the surveyor general's office a
plat and description of the 480 acres surveyed for Joseph
Hunot or his legal representatives. This survey, which was
numbered 2500, was returned to the recorder of land titles on
January 8, 1833, and on February 2, 1833, Frederick R. Conway, the recorder, issued and delivered to Peter Lindell patent
certificate No. 404, for said survey, in favor of Jogeph Hunot
or his legal representatives. July 10, 1819, Rufus Easton and
wife, by deed of that date, conveyed'to William Stokes 234
acres of this survey, described particularly by metes and
bounds. September 29, 1823, Rufus Easton, by deed of that,
date, acknowledged October 9, 1823, and recorded February
9, 1824, in which he recited that he had previously, on September 3, 1818, executed his bond to Samuel Hammond and
James J. Wilkinson for the same land, conveyed to Samuel
Hammond 240 acres, being the whole of the Hunot survey, as
located by Rufus Easton by virtue of certificate No. 161,
except 234 acres of the tract, which he had conveyed to
Stokes. The lot in question in this suit is part of the 240 acres.
Samuel Hammond occupied, fenced and cultivated this land
between 1818 and 1823. In 1824 or 1825 he left St. Louis and
went to South Carolina, where he continued to reside until
1842, when he died leaving five children. On the 12th of

HAMMOND v. JOHNSTON.
Statement of the Case.

March, 1819, Relfe, Chew and Clark instituted suit against
Samuel Hammond in the St. Louis Circuit Court, which
resulted in a judgment against him for the sum of $6841.801,
-which judgment was finally affirmed by the then Supreme
Court at the May term, 1823. An execution was issued on
this judgment, May 23, 1823, and delivered to the sheriff of
St. Louis County, by virtue of which he levied upon 'the 240
acres, as the property of Samuel Hammond, and, after advertisement, the land was sold by him, October 8, 1823, to Relfe
and Chew, who were. the highest and best bidders for the
same, whereupon the sheriff executed his deed to said purchasers in due form of law; dated November 4,1823. This deed
was duly acknowledged and recorded. The land was subsequently sold and conveyed by Relfe and Chew to Peter Lindell, to whom Joseph Hunot and wife had also conveyed. On
August 30, 1859, on Lindell's application, a patent was issued
by the United States and recorded in the General Land Office,
conveying the said survey, with certain exceptions, to Joseph
HunoL or his legal representatives. The patent, although
dated August 30, 1859, was under consideration in the Department of the Interior until November 12, 1860, when the Secretary decided in favor of issuing it.
Plaintiffs in error derive their claim to the land as heirs of
Samuel Hammond or through conveyances made in 1873 and
1874 by such heirs. The defendants Johnston and Baker claim
title to the particular lot sued for under one of the heirs .o
Peter Lindell.
The trial of the action having resulted in a judgment for
the defendants, the case was tiken to the Supreme Court of
Missouri on appeal, by which court the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed. The opinion will be found reported'
in 93 Missouri, 198. Thereupon a writ of error was .sued out
from this court.
The errors assigned here are: First, that the Supreme Court
erred in holding that Hammond had any title to the land in
controversy, which could be levied upon by the sheriff and
sold upon execution against him, for the reason that the
United States survey No. 2500, made under said certificate

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

No. 161, was not returned to the recorder of land titles for
the Territory of Missouri until January 8, 1833, and recorded
February 2, 1833; Second, that the court erred in holding
that the patent to Joseph Hunot or his legal representativeS6
dated August 30, 1859, though not delivered until 1860, took
effect from its date, by which error it was claimed that Samuel
E. Hammond, one of the original plaintiffs, who lived in Tennessee, was erroneously held to be barred.
The Supreme Court of Missouri considered, in its opinion,
and overruled, certain objections of plaintiffs to the deed of
'the sheriff under the execution in the suit of Relfe, Chew and
Clark v. Hammond. These objections were that only a certified copy of the deed was offered in evidence; that the deed
was void for uncertainty of description; that, at the time of
the sale under the execution, Hammond had no interest in the
land subject to sale; and that Easton had no interest in the
property, because the surveyor general had not, at the date of
Easton's deed to Hammond, returned a plat of the survey to
the recorder of land titles, and did not do so until 1833.
Plaintiffs in error contended that, at the time when Easton
conveyed to Hammond, and when the sheriff sold the land
under the execution, -the title to the land was in the United
States. The court conceded that the legal title was in the
United States, -but held that there was an equitable interest in
Easton and those claiming under him, which was subject to
sale under execution, and that, under the statutes of Missouri,
the sheriff's deed was effectual in passing to the purchaser all
the estate and interest which the debtor had at the time of the
judgment. And the court used this language: "Under the
view we have taken of the sheriff's deed, and the force and
effect we have given to it, the title is ii the defendants, and
the judgment will be affirmed. This result as to the effect of
the sheriff's deed rendered it unnecessary to pass upon the
other question presented by the record, but we have ruled
upon them in order that there may be no embarrassment to
either party in a review of this judgment in the Supreme
Court of the United States."

HAMMOND v. JOHNSTON.'
Argument for Plaintiffs In Error.

Mr. George F. Edmua" and -Yr.D. J. Jewet (with who"ni
was Mr, HReri/ R. Deni~o on the brief) for plaintiffs in
error.

On the trial of this case, the plaintiffs in error *asked the
trial court to give .the following instructions: "The -court is
requested to declare the law to be, that, under all -the dooumentary evidence in the case, there was in 182$ no legal nor
equitable title in Samuel Hammond to any part of the land in
what is known as United States survey 'No. 2500, in the city
of St. Louis, ,and for that reason (having no reference to any
other) no title, legal or equitable, to, any part of said land,
was acquired by the purchasers under the levy and sale by
Sheriff Walker, on execution against said Hammond, in September and October, 1823, as put in evidence by defendants in
this case.". This instruction was given by the trial court, but
was overrqled by the Supreme Court.
The defendants also asked the trial court to give, and that
court gave the following instruction: "When the patent to
Joseph Hunot, or. his legal representatives, read in evidence
by defendants, was issued, the same related at least as far
back as the time of the passage of the Act of Congress of
April 26, 1822, if not to June 23, 1819, which is the time the
field survey was made of the land for which said patent was
issued." This instruction was given by the trial court, and
was sustained by the Supreme Court of Missouri, as appears
by their opinion.
Thus it appears that the vital question at issue,
fatal to one
side or the other, is the proper construction and meaning, the
force and effect, of the Act of Congress of February 17, 1815,
before referred to, and known as the New Madrid Act. That
is to say, whether or not there was -on the 8th day of October,
1823, any title out of the United States by virtue of the provisions of said act, that would be called an equity under the
laws of Missouri, and subject to sale on execution.
It also fully appeared by the opinion of 'the Supreme Court
of Missouri, that in giving judgment against the rights claimed
by the plaintiffs in error, under the said New Madrid statute,

78

Opinion of the Court.

they construed the force and effect of that statute, and denied
to the plaintiffs in error the right they claimed under it, and,
as plaintiffs allege, misconstrued said statute so as to give
rights to the defendants in error under it, to which they were
not entitled under the provisions of said law.
The case of .urdock v- The City of YeunpR8i, 20 Wall. 590,
is considered a leading case upon the question of jurisdiction,
and in that case this court says (p. 637): Plaintiffs claim a
right under an act of the United States which was decided
against them by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and this
claim gives jurisdiction to this court. Of course, the right
claimed must involve the construction of a statute of the
United States. The plaintiffs in error here claim a right to this
land under the proper construction of the before named New
adrid statute. See also Rector v. A8ley, 6 Wall. 142; 1e88*ur v. Price,12 How. 59 ; Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92.
.Mr. J. B. HEenderson for defendant in error.

.Mr. James L.

Lewis 9,lso fied a brief for same.

M-R. COImF JsTIE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
It is well settled that where the Supreme Court of a State
decides a Federal question in rendering a judgment, and also
decides against the plaintiff in error upon an independent
grpund not involving a Federal question and broad enough to
maintain the judgment, the writ' of error will be dismissed
without considering the Federal question. RHopkin8 v. ALure,
133 U. S. 380 ; lale v. Aer8, 132 U. S. 554; Hffenderson Bridge
Co. v. Henderson City, 141 U. S 679.
Tested by this rule,
The writ of error must be dismissed, and it i8 80 ordered.
