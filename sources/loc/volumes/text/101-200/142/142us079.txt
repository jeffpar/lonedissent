COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
Hos. 632,639.

Argued November 2, 3, 1891. -Decided

December 14, 1891.

If it appear in a case, brought here in error from a state court, that the decision of the state court was madeupon rules of general jurisprudence,
or that the case was disposed of there on other grounds, broad enough in
themselves to sustain the judgment without considering the Federal
question, and that such question was not necessarily involved, the jurisdiction of this court will not attach.
Before this court can be asked to determine whether a statute has impaired
the obligation of a eontract, it must be made to appear that there was a
legal contract subject to impairment, and some ground to believe that it
has been impaired.
In order to constitute a violation of the constitutional provision against
depriving a person of his own property without due process of law, it
should appear that such person has a property in the particular thing of
which he is alleged to have been deprived.
The contract between the city of New Orleans and the Water Works Company, which forms the basis of these proceedings, was void as being
ultra vires; and, having been repudiated by the city, cannot now be set
up by it as impaired by subsequent state legislation.
A municipal corporation, being a mere agent of the State, stands in its
governmental or public character, in no contract relation with its
sovereign, at whose pleasure its charter may be amended, changed or
revoked without the impairment of any constitutional obligation; but
such a corporation, in respect of its private or proprietary rights and
interests, may be entitled to constitutional protection.
There was no contract between the city find the Water Works Company,
which was protected against state legislation by the Constitution of the
United States.
The repeal of a statute providing that a municipal government may set off
the taxes of a water company against the company's rates for water, and
the substitution of a different scheme of payment in its place, does not
deprive the municipality of its property without due process of law, in
the sense in which the word" property" is used in the Constitution of
the United States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

THE court stated the case as follows:
This was a motion to dismiss the writs of error in these
dases upon the ground that no Pederal question was involved.
The suit was originally begun by the filing of a petition in
the Civil District Court for the parish of Orleans by Edward
Conery, Jr., and about forty others, resident tax-payers of the
city of New Orleans, against the New Orleans Water Works
Company and the city, to enjoin the city from making any
appropriations or drawing any warrants in favor of the Water
Works Company under a certain contract set forth in the bill.
The petition set forth in substance 1. That the legislature in'1877 incorporated the :New Orleans
Water Works Company for the purpose of furnishing the
inhabitants of the city with an adequate supply of pure water,
granting it the exclusive privilege of furnishing water to the
city and its inhabitants, by means of pipes and conduits, for
fifty years from the passage of the act; that the eleventh
section of the act provided that the city should be allowed to
use all water for municipal purposes free of charge, and in
consideration thereof the franchises and property of the company bhould be exempt .from taxation, municipal, state or
parochial; that in 1878 the act was amended in such manner
as to make the company liable to state taxes; and that the
act was accepted by the city, by the Water Works Company
and by all others interested, and the property purchased by
the city from the Commercial Bank was transferred to the
corporation.
2. That at the time the company was incorporated it was
known by every intelligent person in the State that the legislature had no power to exempt property from taxation, except
such as was used for church, school or charitable purposes;
that for several years the Water Works Company supplied
the city with water, and the city demanded of the company
no taxes; that in the year 1881 the city brought suit against
the company for the sum of $11,484.87, taxes assessed upon
its property for that year; that the Water' Works Company
reconvened in that suit and demanded payment for the water

Statement of the Case.
it had furnished; that in the Civil District Court, where the
case was tried, judgment was rendered in favor of the city for
the taxes, and also in favor of the company against the city
for the value of the water supply for that year, namely,
$40,281.87; that the city appealed, and in the Supreme Court
the judgment in favor of the city was affirmed, but the judgment in favor of the company was reduced to $11,484.87, the
exact amount of the taxes for that year; and that the Supreme
Court decided that, under the act of 1877, the company had
no right to recover from the city any sum for the water supply
greater than the city taxes for that year.
3. That the company, in 1884, procured an act of the legislature, providing that the city 'should be required to pay the
company the value of all the water it had supplied or sh6uld
supply during any year for which taxes had been levied for
municipal purposes; that unless the city should provide and
appropriate a sum sufficient for this purpose the company
should not be compelled to deliver water to it; that the taxes
imposed should not be exacted until the city should have provided for the payment of the water supply for the same year;
and that the city should be empowered to contract withL the
company, and determine upon the terms and conditions, and
fix aprice for obtaining from said company such supply of
clear or filtered water.
4. That, acting under this statute, the city council, in September, 1884, passed an ordinance, No. 909, authorizing the
mayor to enter into a contract with the company, and in
pursuance thereof the mayor did enter into such contract,
binding the city, during the whole of the remainder of the
charter of the company, to pay it the sum of $60 for every
fire-plug, fire-hydrant and fire-well connected with the mains
or pipes of the company, "of which there are now 1139, and
which number shall ever be the least measure of the annual
sum to be paid said company," and to pay $60 each for every
additional hydrant, etc. This contract was executed October
3, 1884.
5. That said ordinance, No. 909, and said contract were not
authorized by the act of 1884; that the legislature did not

contemplate that the contract relations between the city and
the company, as set forth in its charter and interpreted by the
Supreme Court, should be in any manner changed, except for
the purpose of enabling the company to furnish clear and
filtered water to the city; that the only proper interpretation
of said act was, that the city, before it demanded the taxes
from the Water Works Company, should provide in its budget
for the payment of the amount due to the company under its
charter as interpreted by the Supreme Court, for the water
furnished in that year by the company, and that the value of
the water mentioned did not mean new value to be fixed by
contract between the company and the city, but the value as
fixed in the charter of the company, which was binding upon
both parties; that, if the act did contemplate a new and
different contract, stipulating what the value of the water was,
it was unconstitutional, null and void, in that -First, it violated that provision of the state constitution which declares
that, "The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special
law creating corporations, or amending, renewing, extending
or explaining the charter thereof." Second, that it violated
Article 57, which declares that "The General Assembly shall
have no power to release or extinguish, or to authorize the
releasing or extinguishing, in whole or in part, the indebtedness, liability or obligation of any corporation or individual
to this State or to any parish or municipal corporation therein."
Third, that it violated Article 234, which provides against
remitting the forfeiture of the charter of any corporation, or
renewing, altering or amending the same, or passing any
general or special law for the benefit of said corporation,
"except on the condition that said corporation shall thereafter
hold its charter subject to the provisions of this' constitution."
Fourth, that it also violates Article 45, because it embraces
more than one object.
6. That, in accordance with this unlawful contract, the city
appropriated, for the year 1885, $68,340," to be paid to the
Water Works Company for thQ water supply for that year, of
which it had already been paid $39,875; that the petitioners
presented a petition to the council protesting against this con-

Counsel for Parties.

tract, calling attention to its unconstitutionality and illegality,
and asking the councilto repudiate it; that the council neglected
to take any action; and that they believe it did not intend to
do so, but would continue to recognize the contract from year
to year and make appropriations to pay it.
Wherefore they prayed an injunction against the city from
making any appropriation under the contract, and that the
contract of October 3, 1884, and ordinance No. 909, and the
act of the legislature of 18S4, be declared unconstitutional,
null and void, and both parties be enjoined from setting up
the contract as valid and binding. Exceptions were filed to
this petition, which were sustained and the petition dismissed.
An appeal was thereupon taken to the Supreme Court of the
State. It does not appear clearly what became of this appeal,
though the decree of the court below seems to have been
reversed, as an answer was subsequently filed in the court of
original jurisdiction, admitting most of the allegations of fact
in the bill, but denying the construction pit upon the contract,
and denying that the price contracted to be paid by the city
was unfair or exorbitant. Judgment was subsequently entered
to the effect that the contract, the ordinance No. 909 of September 23, 1884, and the act of the legislature of 1884, were
unconstitutional, null and void, and an injunction was issued
according to the prayer of the bill. An appeal was taken to
the Supreme Court of the State, upon the hearing of which
the judgment of the lower court was reversed, and the bill
dismissed and the -injunction dissolved. 41 La. Ann. 910.
Thereupon writs of error were sued out from this coiirt,, both
by the city of New Orleans and by Conery and the other taxpayers. The record being filed, this motion was made to
dismiss.

motions.

BROWN, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
In order to sustain the jurisdiction of this court upon the
ground that a Federal question is presented, it should appear
either that such question was apparent in the record, and that
a decision was made thereon, or that, from the facts stated,
such question must have arisen, and been necessarily involved
in the case. If it appear either that the decision of the state
.court was made upon rules of general jurisprudence, or that
the case was disposed of upon other grounds, broad enough in
themselves to sustain the judgment without considering the
Federal question, and that such question was not necessarily
involved, the jurisdiction of this court will not attach.
(1) Was there a Federal question involved in this case?
None such appears upon the face of the bill, the liasi of which
is a conflict between the act of 1884, and the ordinance and
contract thereunder and the constitution of the State. Four
clauses of the constitution are cited, all of which this act is
alleged to violate; but in none of them is there a suggestion
of a conflict with the Federal constitution or laws. On May
27, 1887, the city of New Orleans filed a brief answer to the
bill denying, all and singular, the allegations therein contained,
etc., and praying judgment against the plaintiffs' demand.
On November 3, 1888, without withdrawing its first answer,
it filed an amended or supplemental answer, in which it
assumed an entirely different position, averring that by the
terms of the act of 1877 the city was entitled to its supply of
water free of charge, "and that the guaranty of this law to
the city, securing to it the benefits of free water, has not been
and cannot be diminished without impairing the obligation of
contracts, and thereby violating Article 1, section 10 of the
Constitution of the United States;" and that the ordinance
No. 909 was an attempt to frustrate and set at naught the
terms of the act of 1877.

NEW ORLEANS v. N. 0. WATER WORKS CO.

85

Opinion of the Court.

The second answer further proceeded to allege the illegality
of the contract of October 3, 1884, also of the ordinance No.
909, which was charged to be in direct violation of the act of
1884:; and that the decision of the Supreme Court gave a
judicial construction to section 11 of the act of 1887, and
determined the effect of the legislative contract between the
city and the Water Works Company by virtue of the act of
1877, and declared that the latter, under said contract, had
no power to demand or require from the city of New Orleans
in any year any sum for the water supply, which it was bound
under its charter to furnish to the city, greater than the
amount of the city taxes for that year.
The answer, in its further averments, is a substantial iteration of the charges made in the bill, and sets forth that in case
the courts should decide that the act of 1884: did authorize the
city and the company to enter into a new contract, stipulating
the value of the water to be supplied, the act itself was unconstitutional, in that it violated no less than six articles of the
state constitution.
The District Court, in giving its reasons for judgment, held
that, notwithstanding the act of 1884, the obligation of the
company to furnish the water supply still subsisted, subject
only to the qualifications that compensation equal in amount
to the taxes exacted might be claimed; and that, in requiring
the city to pay for all the water it received, (in the event of its
demanding the tax,) and in providing specially that, unless it
set apart a sufficient sum to make such payment, the company
should not be compelled to deliver water as provided in its
charter, the legislature was releasing or extinguishing an obligation which had been ascertained, and defined by the Supreme
Court of the State, from the Water Company to the city of
New Orleans, within the meaning of the State constitutional
provision, Article 57, which provided that "the General Assembly shall have no power to release or extinguish, or to
authorize the releasing or extinguishing, in whole or in part,
the indebtedness, liability or obligation of any corporation or
individual to this State, or to any parish or municipal corporation therein." The court, therefore, sustained the prayer of

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

the bill and granted an injunction. There was no reference in
this opinion to any Federal question.
On appeal to the Supreme Court, the judgment of the District Court was reversed, the majority of the court holding
that the decision of the court in the prior case annulling the
exemption from taxation contained in section 11 of the act
of 1877 did not regulate the contract between the parties for
the future as to the price of the water to be furnished by the
company, since that would be making a contract for the parties which they never intended, and which was not warranted
by any promises in the water works charter; that there was
no other section of the act imposing any obligation upon the
company to furnish free water to the city for any franchise or
privilege granted by the State, and that the city could not
impose any obligation upon it contrary to the original grant,
without its consent. The court further held that there was no
proof in the record of any fraud or undue advantage obtained
by the Water Works Company over the city, and that, independent of any statutory provision subsequently enacted,
authorizing the city to contract for its water supply, (alluding
to the act of 1884,) it had full and plenary power to do so
under the provisions of its charter. The court also held that
the act of 1884, and the ordinance and the contract made in
pursuance of it, violated no provision of the state constitution
and Were valid. No allusion was made in this opinion to any
Federal question..
The Chief Justice, dissenting, was of the opinion that the
judgment in the prior suit settled forever the question of the
respective liability of both corporations, the one for the water
supplied, the other for the taxes demandable ; that its effect
was to close the door for all time to those litigants on the subject of such reciprocal liability, the one to the other; that the
moment it was rendered it became the property of each party,
who then acquired the right of using it as an effectual shield
for protection against any further demand; that it was designed to establish firmly for the future, during the term of
the existence of the company, that in no case would it ever..
claim from the city for water supply any amount in excess of

NEW ORLEANS v. N. 0.- WATER WORKS CO.
Opinion of the Court.

that which the city would have the right to demand for taxes
due her; that, while the city of New Orleans was a functionary created by the sovereign, it did not follow that the sovereign could divest it of its property, appropriate it to its own
use, or give it away, or impair the obligation of contracts in
its favor; and that it was incompetent for the legislature to
deprive the city of its right of ownership to the judgment in
its favor wilereby it was to be relieved from all amount exceeding the taxes due it by the Water Works Company. This is
the only opinion which contains any suggestion of 6 Federal
question. There was another dissenting opinion, but the dissent was based solely upon the ground of-a conflict between
the act of 1884 and the state constitution, and upon the theory
that the prior judgment operated by way of estoppel against
any subsequent agitation of the questions therein decided.
While there is in the amended and supplemental answer of
the city a formal averment that the ordinance No. 909 impaired the obligation of a contract arising out of the act of
1877, which entitled the city to a supply of water free of
charge, the bare averment of a Federal question is not in all
cases sufficient. It must not be wholly without foundation.
There must be at least color of ground for such averment,
otherwise a Federal question might be set up in almost any
case, and the jurisdiction of this court invoked simply for the
purpose of delay. Thus in Milligar v. Hartuee, 6 Wall.
258, it was held that to bring a case within that provision of
the Judiciary Act, which declares that the final judgment of
a state court may be reexamined, where is drawn in question
the validity of an authority exercised under the United States,
there must be something more than a bare assertion of the exercise of such authority. In delivering the opinion of the
court the Chief Justice observed: "The authority intended
by the act is one having a real existence, derived from competent governmental power. If a different construction had
been intended, Congress would doubtless have used fitting
words. The act would have given jurisdiction in cases of
decisions against claims of authority under the United States.
In respect to the question we are now considering, ' authority '

. OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

stands upon the same footing with 'treaty' or Istatute.' If
a right were claimed under a treaty or statute, and on looking into the record, it should appear that no such treaty or
statute existed, or was in force, it would hardly be insisted'
that this court could review the decision of a state court, that
the right claimed did not exist." This language was used in
connection with the first clause of section 709 of the Revised
Statutes, "where is drawn in question the validity bf a treaty
or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United
States, and the decision is against their validity," .but it is
equally applicable to the next clause, which covers the case
under consideration, "where is drawn in question the validity
of a statute of, or an atithority exercised .under, any State, on
the grodnd of their being repugnant to the Constitution,
treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in
favor of their validity."
Applying the principle of this decision to the present case,
we thipk that before we can be asked to determine whether a
statute has impaired the obligation of a contract, it should
appear that there was i legal contract subject to impairment,
and some ground to believe that it has been impaired; and
that to constitute a violation of the provision against depriving any person of his propeity without due process of law, it
should appear that such person has a property in the particular thing of which he is alleged to have been deprived.
(2) The-contract relied upon in this case is that contained in
section 11 of the act of 187, which provided that the city
should be allowed the free use of water for municipal purposes in consideration whereof the franchise and property of
the Water Company should be exempted from taxation.
There are several reasons, however, why the city cannot claim
that this contract was impaired by subsequent legislation:
first, because the. contract itself, which was in reality between
the State and the Water Works Company, was ultra vire and
void, and was so declared by the Supreme Court of Louisiana
in the case betw~een the city and thd Water Works Company,
36 La. Ann. 432; second, because the city repudiated its contract by bringing suit against the company for its taxes; and

Opinion of the Court.

-

it does not now lie in the mouth of its counsel to claim that
the obligation of such contract was impaired by subsequent
legislation, when such legislation was rendered necessary byJ
or at least was the natural outgrowth of, its own repudiation
of the contract; third, the city being a municipal corporation
and the creature of the state legislature, does not stand in a
position to claim the benefit of the constitutional provision in
question, since its charter can be amended, changed or even
abolished at the will of the legislature. In The Dartmouth College Ca8e, I Wheat. 518, 660, 661, in which the inviolability
of private charters was first asserted by this court, a distinction is taken, in the opinion of Mr. Justice Washington, between corporations for public government nfad those for
private charity; and it is said that the first being for public
advantage, are to be governed according to the law of the
land; and that such a corporation may be controlled, and its
constitution altered and amended by the government, in such
manner as the publi interest may require. "Such legislative
interferences cannot be said to impair the contract by which
the corporation was formed, because there is in reality but
one party to it, the trustees or governors of the corporation
being merely the trustees for the publib, the cestui que trust
of the foundation." Mr. Justice Story was also of opinion,
page 694, that, "corporations for mere public government, such
as towns, cities and counties, may in many respects be subject to legislative control."
In the case of East hart'ordv- HartordBridge Company,
10 How. 511, 533, 534, the constitutionality of an act of the
legislature discontinuing a ferry, the franchise of which for
more than one hundred years had belonged to thet town of
Hartford, and subsequently to that of East Hartford, was
drawn in question. It was claimed by the town that the
State had impaired the obligation of its contract; but it was
held that "the parties to this grant did not, by their charter,
stand in the attitude toward each other of making a contract
by it such as is contemplated in the Constitution, and as could
not be modified by subsequent legislation. The legidiature was
acting here on the one part, and public municipal and ,olitical

.

. Hence,

generally, the doings between them and the legislature are in
the nature of legislation rather than compact, and subject to
all the legislative conditions just named, and, therefore, to be
considered as not' violated by subsequent legislative changes."
So in Laramie County v. Albany County, 92 U. S. 307, 311,
it was held that the legislature had power to diminish or enlarge the area of a county whenever the public convenience or
necessity required. "Institutions of the kind," said Mr. Tustice
Clifford, "whether called counties or towns, are the auxiliaries
of the State in the important business of municipal rule, and
cannot have the least pretension to sustain their privileges or
their existence upon anything like.a contract between them
and the legislature of the State, because there is not and cannot be any reciprocity of stipulation, and their objects and
duties are utterly incompatible with everything of the nature
of compact." So in the recent case of William8on v. .New
Jersey, 130 U. S. 189, 199, it was held that the power of taxation on the part of a municipal corporation is not private
property or a vested right of property in its hands; but the
conferring of such power is an exercise by the legislature of a
public and governmental power which cannot be imparted in
perpetuity, and is always subject to revocation, modification
and control, and is not the subject of contract. Said Mr. Justice Blatchford: "We 'are clearly of opinion that such a grant
of the power of taxation, by the legislature of a State, does
not form such a contract between the State and the township
as is within the protection of the provision of the Constitution
of the United States which forbids the passage by a State of a
law impairing the obligation of contracts."
At the last term of this court; in the case of Bsse88 Public
Road Board v. Skinkle, 140 U. S. 334, it was held, the Chief
Yfustice speaking for the court, that an executive agency created
by a State for the purpose of improving public highways, and
empowered to assess the cost of its improvements upon adjoin-

Opinion of the Court.

ing lands, and to purchase such lands as were delinquent in
the payment of the assessment, did not by such purchase acquire a contract right in the land so bought, which the State
could not modify without violating the provisions of the
Cinstitution of the United States. But further citations of
authorities upon this point are unnecessary; they are full and
conclusive to the point that the municipality, being a mere
agent of the State, stands in its governmental or public character in no contract relation with its sovereign, at whose
pleasure its charter may be amended, changed or revoked,
without the impairment of any constitutional obligation, while
with respect to its private or proprietary rights and interests it
may be entitled to the constitutional protection. In'this case
the city has no more right to claim an immunity for its contract with the Water Works Company, than it would have
had if such contract had been made directly with the State.
The State, having authorized such contract, might revoke or
modify it at its pleasure.
Equally untenable is the claim that the Supreme Court of
the State gave a construction to this act of 1877, which constitutes a contract between the Water Works Company and
the city, which subsequent legislation could not impair. In
construing section 11, the Supreme Court held that the exemption from taxation was invalid, and that the reconventional
demand of the Water Works Company for the water supplied
was sustainable only to the exact amount of taxes for the same
year. This, however, was not the making of a new contract
between the Water Works Company and the city, but the nullification of an old one, and a determination of the respective
rights of the city and the company under that section of the
act. Courts have no power to make new contracts or to impose new terms upon parties to contracts without their consent. Their powers are exhausted in fixing the rights of
parties to contracts already existing. But conceding that the
decision of the Supreme Court amounted simply to Ln interpretation of an existing contract, by which the company agreed
to furnish the city with water in consideration of the amount
of its taxes, yet the contract was, for the reasons already

Opinion of the Court.

stated, so far as the city was concerned, subject to the will of
the legislature. As was justly remarked in the concurring
opinion of Mr. Justice Poch6 in this case: "It surely cannot
be seriously urged that the legislature is stripped of its power
to~authorize a contract to have effect in the future by judicial
interpretation of a contract, and which at the time had reference to the present and to the past only. A very large proportion of the legislation in all the States is prompted by the
decisions of the courts, and is intended to remedy some mischief pointed out by or resulting from the utterances of the
courts of the country."
Our conclusion upon this branch of the case, therefore, is,
that there was no contract between the city and the Water
Works Company which was protected by the constitutional
provision in question.
(3) Has the city been deprived of its property without due
process of law? It certainly has not been deprived of its
property in the judgment of the Supreme Court in its favor
for the taxes, since the judgment was paid and satisfied. The
only property it is assumed to have, then, arises from the interpretation put by the Supreme Court upon the act of 1871,
which, it is argued, created an indefeasible right on the part of
the city to set off its taxes against the claim of the Water
Works Company for water, of which it could not be deprived.
But such interpretation determined only the respective rights
of the parties as they then existed, and, for the reasons already
stated, such rights, at least so far as the city is concerned, were
subject to change at the will of the legislature. Indeed, under
the act of 1884: and ordinance No. 909, the right of the city to
its taxes remains unimpaired; the only change made is in the
creation of a new basis of liability of the city in respect to its
water supply for municipal purposes. The only property of
which it was deprived was the right it had possessed under
ths act of 1877 of paying for its water supply in taxes; but,
if this were property at all, even within the liberal definition
of that word given by -Mr.Justice Bradley, in CambeZl v. Jolt,
115 U. S.620, 630, it was not such a vested right as was beyond the control of the legislature. An adjudication of the

rights of two private parties to a contract, with respect to the
terms of such contract, does not prevent their agreeing upon
other and different terms for the future. The fact that such
parties are a private and a public corporation is immaterial, so
long as the right to contract exists.
(4) Little need be said with regard to the appeal of Conery
and the other taxpayers; they sue in the right of the city, the
rights of the city are their rights, and they have no other or
greater rights upon this appeal than has the city. Indeed, the,
city has, in its amended and supplemental answer, joined with
them in the assertion of its rights, and they~are bound by the
disposition of the case against it. As there is no Federal
question properly presented in this case,
