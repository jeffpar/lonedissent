FAtANSWORTH v. 'DUFFJNER.
APPEAL FROM TM DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES-FOR

THE DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA.
No. 69. Argued November 4,1891. -Decided

December 14,1891.

In a suit in equity for the rescission of a contract of purchase, and to recover the moneys paid thereon on the grbund that "it was induced by
the false and fraudulent representations of the vendor, if the means of
knowledge respecting the matters falsely represented are equally open to
purchaser and vendor, the former is charged With knowledge of all that
by the use of such means he could have ascertained: and a fortiori he is
precluded from rescinding the contract and from recovery of the consideration money if it appears that he sivailed himself of those means,
and made investigations, and relied upon the evidences they furnished,
and not upon the representations of the vendor.
Statements by a vendor of real estate to the vendee, (made during the
negotiations for the sale,) as to his own social and political position
and religious associations, are held, even if false, not to be fraudulent,
so as to work a rescission of the contract of sale.
It is no ground for rescinding such a contract that the agents of the ven-

dors, who had received the full purchase money agreed upon, misappropriated a part of it.

OCTOBER TERMN, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

THE court stated the case as follows:
On February 26, 1879, a tax deed was executed by the clerk
of the County Court of Upshur County, to George Henning
and others, for a tract of land supposed to contain forty thousand acres. The grantees in this tax deed were twenty-two
in number, who had entered into a written agreement on
December 11, 1877, to purchase the land at a tax sale in that
month. On April 24, 1883, this agreement for the purchase
of this land was executed:
"We, the undersigned, agree to and with George Henning
& Co., and bind ourselves to do certain things (through and
with the committee .of said company, viz., D. D. T. Farnsworth, Jackman Cooper and P. Thomas) as follows: We
agree to pay to said committee fifteen thousand dollars for a
certain tract of 40,000 acres of land, known as the Wm. H.
Morton land, that was sold for non-payment of the taxes and
bought, by said George Henning and others, to whom the
State of West Virginia made deed, etc., one hundred dollars
of which sum in hand paid to said committee, two thousand
dollars to be paid to'said committee at the Buckhannon Bank
on the 4th of May, 1883, the residue of said fifteen thousand
dollars to be paid at the time of the making of a deed for said
land, said deed to be made within forty days or as soon there
after as possible. The deed shall convey all the rights and
title to said land as conveyed by the State in a deed made to
said company; the deed to be made to Joseph Duffner, Charles
Duffner and Matthew Duffner (the undersigned), with the
guarantee that the said tract of land shall contain at least
twenty thousand acres not legally held by actual settlers
within the boundary of said tract of 40,000 acres; but in th6
making of the deed for said land it shall provide that all the
actual settlers within boundary who have been in peaceable
possession for ten years according to law, and have paid the
taxes on their claim or title shall not be disturbed by any
attempt in law from their boundaries so held by deed or title;
all the rest of said 40,000 acres is to be held by the under-

signed. Now, if the said D. D. T. Farnsworth, Jackman
Cooper and P. Thomas shall make'or cause to be made to us,
the undersigned, a deed as above stated for said 40,000 acres,
we will faithfully perform our obligations herein made."

"P. S. We agree also to pay the taxes oil said land for the
year 1883."
Thereafter a deed was made'in pursuance of this agreement.
The deed was dated May,12, 1883, but not in fact delivered
until July 14, 1883. It purported to grant "all the rights,
title and interest vested" in the grantors by the tax deed
heretofore referred to, which was specifically. described. It
also contained this provision, in reference to settlers on the
tract:
"The parties of the first part: herein named convey the
above-named 40,000 acres of land to said parties of the second
part herein named with the provisions that all of the actual
settlers within the boundaries of said survey, who have been
in peaceable possession for ten years previous to this date, according to law, and, having paid all of the taxes on their claim
of title to any of said land, shall not be disturbed by any
attempt or action in law from their boundaries so held by
them by deed as aforesaid; but all of the residue of said
40,000 acres is herein conveyed to the parties of the second
part and held by them with the guarantee that said tract or
survey of land shall contain at least 20,000 acres not legally
held by actual settlers, as above named and provided for,
within said boundary of 40,000 acres; but if in case the quantity of land in said survey should prove to be less than 20,000
acres after deducting the number of acres legally claimed and
held by actual settlers, as above herein named, then the parties
of the first part, grantors, who now constitute the legal owners of said tract of land which was sold for the non-paynient

of the taxes due thereon in the name of William H. Morton,
are to refund back to the said Duffners, parties of the second
part, in proportion per acre for any deficiency of land below
or less than 20,000 acres in said survey."
On February 12, 1886, Joseph Duffner, who had in fact
advanced all the money for the purchase of this land, and who
had succeeded to the rights of his associates in the deed, filed
his bill in the District Court of the United States for the District of West Virginia, setting forth the fact of his purchase
and the amount of money paid, and alleging that the purchasers were induced to purchase through the false and fraudulent representations of the several grantors, such false and
fraudulent representations being set out in full; also, that the
tax deed was void, and conveyed no title to any land by
reason of three matters specifically pointed out; ani praying a decree that the several grantors be adjudged to return to him the moneys by him paid, in proportion to their
several interests as grantors in the conveyance. To this bill
the defendants answered separately. Thereafter, on pleadings and proofs, the case was submitted to the court, and a
decree entered in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the
prayer of the bill, s~tting aside the contract of April, 1883,
and adjudging that the several defendants pay to the plaintiff their proportionate amounts of the moneys paid by him.
The amounts thus decreed against two of the defendants,
Daniel D. T. Farnsworth and Philip Thomas, being each over
five thousand dollars, they have appealed to this court.

MR. JusTicE BREWER, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
This is a suit for the rescission of a contract of purchase, and
to recover the moneys paid thereon, on the ground that it was
induced by the false and fraudulent representations of the vendors. In respect to such an action it has been laid down by
many authorities that, where the means of knowledge respecting the matters falsely represented are equally open to purchaser and vendor, the former is charged with knowledge of
all that by the use of such means he could have ascertained.
In Slaughters' Administrator v. Gerson, 13 Wall. 379, 383, this
court said: "Where the means of knowledge are at hand and
equally available to both parties, and the subject of purchase
is alike open to their inspection, if the purchaser does not avail
himself of these means and opportunities, he will not be heard
to say that he has been deceived by the vendor's misrepresentations. If, having eyes, he will not see matters directly
before them, where no concealment is made or attempted, he
will not be entitled to favorable consideration when he complains that he has suffered from his own voluntary blindness,
and been misled by overconfidence in the statements of
another. And the same rule obtains when the complaining
party does not rely upon the misrepresentations, but seeks

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

from. other quarters means of verification of the statements
made, and acts upon the information thus obtained." See also
Southern .Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U. S. 247; Farrarv.
Churqhill, 135 U. S. 609. In Ludington v. Renick, 7 West
Va. 273, it was held that "a party seeking the rescission of a
contract, on the ground of misrepresentations, must establish
the same by clear and irrefragable evidenee; and if it apgiears
that he has resorted to the proper means of verification, so as
to show that he in fact relied upon his own inquiries, or if the
means of investigation and verification were at hand, and his
attention drawn to them, relief will be denied." In the case
of -Attwood v. Small, decided by the House of Lords, and reported in 6 C1. and Finn. 232, 233, it is held that "if a purchaser, choosing to judge for himself, does not avail himself of
the knowledge or means of knowledge open to him or to his
agents, he cannot be heard to say he was deceived by the vendor's representations." And in 2 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, section 892, it is declared that a party is not justified in
relying upon representations made to him - " 1. When, before entering into the contract or other transaction, he actually resorts to the ptoper means of ascertaining the truth and
verifying the statement. 2. When, having the opportunity
of making such examination, he is charged with the knowledge
which he necessarily would have obtained if he had prosecuted it with diligence. 3. When the representation is conaerning generalities equally within the knowledge or the means of
acquiring knowledge possessed by both parties."
But if the neglect to make reasonable examinations would
preclude a party from rescinding a contract on the ground
of false and fraudulent representations, a fortiori.is he precluded when it appears that he did make such examination,
and relied on the evidences furnished by such examination, and
not upon the representations.
It becomes necessary now to state some facts appearing in
the record, facts that are undisputed, and coming from the
lips of plaintiff and his witnesses. Matthew Duffner, the son
of plaintiff and one of the three parties in the contract and
deed, was in partnership with a man by the name of Wood.

FARNSWORTH v. DUFFTER.
Opinion of the Court.

This partner informed him that he had a cousin, one Colonel
Wood, living near Oakland, Maryland, who had lands for sale.
A few weeks after receiving this information" Duffner called
on Colonel Wood, and was shown by him a map of this land,
located within a few miles of Buckhannon, in Upshur County,,
West Virginia. By arrangement the three Duffners met
Colonel Wood at Clarksburg, and went with him to Buckhannon with a view of examining the land. Soon after their
arrival Colonel Wood became intoxicated and took no further
part in the transaction. While there they met the two appellants and Jackman Cooper'(and this was the first interview or
communication between the parties) and entered into the contract of April 24., 1883, with them as a committee on behalf of
all the owners. Prior, however, to this they had gone on to the
]and in company with Watson Westfall, who was, or had been
for years, the surveyor of the county, spending the time from
Saturday morning until Tuesday night in going to, examining,
and returning therefrom. After executing ihis contract the
Duffners returned to Cleveland. Eaving been advised that
the deed was executed and ready for delivery, and in July
following, this plaintiff, with a lawyer from Cleveland - Mr.
Fish, a gentleman who had been acting as his counsel for
fifteen or twenty years, a lawyer of experience, sixty-four
years of age - went to Buckhannon. He took Mr. Fish with
him for the purpose of having him examine the title and the
deed. On arriving at Buckhannon, Mr. Fish proceeded to
make such investigation as he deemed sufficient; and after
ihree days passed in an examination of the records and a study
of the statutes of the State, he advised Mr. Duffner to take the
deed; and on the giving of such advice Mr. Duffner received
the deed and paid the balance due on the contract. After
this, having missed the train, Mr. Fish remained another day
in Buckhannon, and continuea his examination of the records;
and on his way home stopped at the State capital to see if
proper returns had been made to the State auditor's office.
The result of all his investigations was satisfactory; and, as
both plaintiff and Mr. Fish testify (and their testimony is corroborated by many witnesses, and contradicted by none), it

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

was after Mr. Fish advised him to take the deed that he took
it and paid his money.
But one conclusion can be deduced from these facts -and
that is, that the plaintiff did not rely upon any representations
made to him by the defendants, but through his own counsel
-made investigation of the title, and purchased on the strength
of that counsel's opinion thereof. Within settled rules, he is,
therefore, now precluded from rescinding this contract on the
ground of such representations.
But the case does not rest on this alone. Thus .far we have
considered only such facts as are disclosed by the testimony of
the plaintiff, his son, and his counsel. Let us look at some of
the testimony produced by the other side. Frederick-Brinkman,
an apparently disinterested witness, testifies that he met plaintiff on his several visits to West Virginia; and, hearing from
him that he was coming there to buy land, cautioned him
against West Virginia land titles, calling them "polecat"
titles, and advised him before purchasing to consult some of the
local lawyers, naming three or four of them. To which plaintiff replied that he would be careful, and that before purchasing he would bring his own counsel from Cleveland; and
added that he was a good lawyer, and one in whom he had
confidence. Again, while Mr. Fish was making his examination of the records in the county office, three or four of the
defendants were present; and some one or more of them said
to him, in the presence of the plaintiff, that some people called
their title a wildcat title; and they wanted him to make a full
examination, and be satisfied that it was good, "for they
wanted no after-claps or further trouble about the land
thereafter." So we have not only equal means of knowledge, but also an actual examination by the purchaser through
his counsel' a completion of the contract when, and only
when, his counsel advises him that the title is satisfactory;
a prior caution to the purchaser that land titles in West
Virginia were doubtful, and his reply that he proposed to rely
upon the advice of his own counsel; and the further declaration of the defendants to such counsel, in the presence of the
purchaser, before the completion of the contract, that they de-

Opinion of the Court.

sired a full examination, in order that there might be no after
trouble. Surely, if there ever-was a case in which the doctrine
of caveat emptor applies, this is one.
It may be well now to notice the three matters which are
alleged in the bill as invalidating the title: First, that there was
no note or record of any kind in the office of the clerk of the
county court of Upshur County of the sheriff's report of his
sale, until the 10th day of January, 1878, which was more than
ten days after the sale; which omission, counsel says, has been
decided by the Supreme Court of West Virginia to invalidate a
tax deed. But this was a defect apparent on the records, the
very records which Mr. Fish was examining. Second, that
William H. Morton, in whose name the land was returned delinquent for the non-payment of the taxes of 1876, never had
any Valid title; his only claim of title resting in a series of
fraudulent papers, admitted to record in the county of Upshur
on the 16th day of February, 1876. Then follows a statement
of the instruments in that chain of title, to which the bill
adds: "From this it will be seen that all of these papers
except the last were admitted to record upon certificates purporting to have been made on the 24th day of February, 1867,
which was Sunday, by one Frederick Bull, who only goes so
far as to certify to the papefs as copies of the papers which
were then produced before him." But this chain of title, as
the bill avers and. the testimony shows, was on the records,
and was examined by Mr. Fish; and it also appears that Mr.
Fish noticed that one of these instruments at least, thus placed
on record, was not an original instrument, but only, a Popy.
So the defect was not only one which could have been noticed
by Mr. Fish, but also, so far as the objection runs to the record
being of a copy of an instrument, was in fact perceived by
him. Thereafter he eiamined to see that this tract of land
was listed for that year in the name of Morton only; and
concluded that, as tax proceedings are proceedings in rer
against the land, they were not vitiated by any defect in the
chain of title to the party in whose name the land was listed.
Third, it was alleged that the title under the tax deed was
void, because the tract of land described therein was and is

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

owned by other persons claiming under and owning by superior patents. And then the bill sets out some eleven patents,
issued between 1785 and 1793, for large tracts of land, which
patents, the bill alleges, covered and included the tract in
controversy. But these, too, were facts appearing on the
public records.
It is worthy of remark here, that in the latter part of the
eighteenth century it was a common practice for the State of
Virginia to make grants of large tracts of lands in the then
unoccupied portions of the State now included in the State of
West Virginia, the boundaries of which grants were often conflicting and overlapping. Hence arose, under authority of the
statutes, a form of patent known as an "inclusive" grant.
Grants of that nature were before this court, and considered in
the cases of Scott v. Jatlife,5 Pet. 81; Armstrong v. Aforrill,
14 Wall. 120; and Halsted v. Buster, 140 U. S. 273. So the
exact tract of land which any of these patentees actually
acquired could only be determined after surveys, and a comparison of the dates of the entries, surveys and patents. And
as the descriptions in tax proceedings followed those in patents
and other deeds, -lands being listed in the names of the owners
according to the system then obtaining in that State, -the
same uncertainty of boundary existed as to lands held by tax
titles. But with reference to all these matters, alleged as
defects in the title, it is enough to say that they were apparent
on the records, were open to the inspection of plaintiff and his
counsel, and as to one of them at least, it was a defect first
noticed by Mr. Fish, and deemed by him insufficient to destroy
the tax title.
So far as respects the matter of settlers on the land - settlers
having occupied portions long enough to acquire title by occupancy - both the contract and the deed give notice of that
fact, and make provision therefor. It also appears that the
Duffners made a general examination of the land before the
contract was entered into, and spent three nights at the house
of Isaac W. Simons, a settler claiming title by occupancy, who,
.as he testifies, notified them of his claim of title. As the plaintiff after his purchase never caused a survey to be made of the

FARNSWORTH v. DUFFNER.

Opinion of the, Court.

land, and never sought to find out how much of the ground
was occupied by these settlers, it is still an unsettled question
how much of the forty thousand acres described in the tax
deed was within the limits of prior grants, or in fact so occupied.
We now pass to a notice of the particular matters of fraud
alleged in the bill; and the first is, that the defendants knew
that their title was worthless, and with this knowledge, deliberately represented it to be good for the sake of inducing the
purchase. The matters in the testimony which are relied upon
to substantiate this charge are, that the title was in fact worthless; that there was talk in the community to that effect, which
'had .come to the knowledge of defendants; that such an opinion had been given by a prominent lawyer, at one time a judge'
of the Supreme Court of that State, as was, known to them;
the presumption from their long residence in the community
that all would have known, and the fact that some did know,
of the existence of these conflicting grants ; and the testimony
of Mr. Fleming, a lawyer in Buckhannon, that these appellants
stated to him he might be called upon to advise as to the title,
and intimated that an opinion in its favor was desired, and that
they would pay him for his services. But, as against these
matters, it appears that these defendants were not lawyers, but
farmers and business men, not possessing or pretending to possess that knowledge of the law which would enable them to
determine as to the validity of the title; that they advanced
not only the money for the purchase in the first instance, but,
continued during the succeeding years and until this sale to
pay the taxes, the amount of taxes thus paid being, as stated
by the county clerk, $2983.82, and the total amount paid by
these defendants in one way and another, towards perfecting
their title, according to the testimony of one of the defendants,
being $3150.67; that they did not pretend that the title they
were selling was other than a tax deed; and that they indicated in the papers the tax deed on which their title was based,
and referred the purchaser to the records by which the validity
of their title could be determined. While they may have
known, as is generally known, that there is an uncertainty
about a tax title, yet they had confidence enough in itto invest

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

their money therein for a series of years, and to invite the purchaser to an examination of the record evidences thereof. So
far as respects the testimony of Mr. Fleming, the lawyer, it is
proper to say that he does not testify that there was any direct
suggestion to the alleged effect, but simply that he obtained
an impression from the general tone of the conversation, while
these appellants positively deny that there was any suggestion
or thought on their part of anything improper; and say that
they simply notified him that they might be asked to name
some local lawyer to examine the title for the purchaser, and
that they should take pleasure in recommending him.
Again, it is charged that these defendants surrounded this
purchaser and his counsel and succeeded in preventing them
from having conversations with other citizens, or making inquiries of them, and ascertaining such facts or reports as might
have been gathered from such inquiries. But any attempt of
this kind is denied by all. It was natural that they should be
interested in making a sale, and that they should do what they
could to show attentions to the purchaser and his counsel, and
should be often with them; but it does not appear that they
hindered them in any way from making such inquiries and
investigations as they desired. On the contrary, their testimony is that they urged them to make full inquiry and investigation before consummating the purchase.
It is further charged in the bill that, "in order to induce
said plaintiff to accept and confide in the said representations
as to the validity of the said title, and in order to prevent the
said plaintiff from making inquiries in other directions respecting the same, the said Daniel D. T. Farnsworth, at the time of
making the said representations respecting the said title, also
represented to the said plaintiff that he, the said Daniel D. T.
Farnsworth, had been governor of the State of West Virginia
and a member of the senate of the same State, and was at the
time of making such representations the president of a bank and
the president of a railroad company and a member of the Baptist. Church, and had heretofore built a church edifice, which he
pointed out to the said plaintiff, and that he was not such a
man as would deceive or take advantage of the said plaintiff,

FARNSWORTH v. DUFFNER.
Opinion of the Court.

or would have anything to do with titles to land unless they
were good titles."
According to the plaintiff's testimony, it would appear that
these statements were made before the signing of the original
contract. According to Mr. Farnsworth, that, while he did
make statements of that character, it was only after the contract was signed, and while walking about the city with the
plaintiff, and in response to inquiries made by him. But, further, the testimony of Mr. Farnsworth is that those matters
concerning himself, thus stated, were true, and there is no suggestion anywhere that they were not true. If true, they certainly were not false and fraudulent representations, and, if
false, they were not of a character to invalidate a contract.
It would hardly do to hold that a party was induced into a
contract by false and fraudulent representations, because one
of the vendors represented that he had been governor of the
State, and was a member of the church, and president of a
bank and a railroad -company.
One other matter alonereqnres notice. It appears that in
the talk preceding the contract of purchase the committee had
named $20,000 as the price of the land, and had asked a further sum of $1500 for their own services; but that the final
outcome of the negotiations was the fixing of $15,000 as the
price of the land, and $6500 to be paid to these two appellants
for their services. It is enough to say, that whatever wrong
these appellants were guilty of in making this change, was a
wrong to their associates and not to the purchaser. It is not
a matter he can complain of. The full amount which he had
to pay was the amount they named in the first instance, to
wit, $21,500, and if in fraud of the rights of their associates
they changed the distribution of that sum, it was a wrong
which only the parties injured can take advantage of.
This.is the whole case presented by the record. The vendors pretended to sell only a tax title. They specially guarded
themselves against any rights of actual settlers., The validity
of their title and the extent of it were matters apparent on the
records, and open to the inspection of the purchaser. lHe did
not act on their representations that the title was good, but

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Syllabus.

brought his own counsel from home to examine those records,
and acted upon his judgment of the title. The conduct of the
defendants supports their testimony, that they believed there
was validity to their title. The particular statements complained of as against one of these appellants were true in fact,
and, if not true, were not of a character to avoid the purchase.
The wrong which these two appellants are specially charged
to have been guilty of was a wrong against their associates
and not against the purchaser, nor one of which he can take
advantage. It follows, therefore, that there was no such
showing made as would justify a court in rescinding the contract of purchase, and decreeing a repayment of the money.
The decree wiM be reversed, and the case remanded, with
istructions to dismiss the bill as to these appellants.
