MENDENHALL v. HALL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 158. Submitted by appellant, December 13,1889; by appellee, March 24, 1890.-Decided
April 7, 1890.

When one of two defendants in a suit in equity demurs to the bill and
the demurrer is sustained, and the other defendant answers, and the -bill
is then dismissed, and the plaintiff appeals, and files an appeal-bond running to "the defendants," and the appeal is duly entered here within the
prescribed time, this court has jurisdiction of the appeal, and, if the
defendant as to whom the bill was dismissed on demurrer does not appear, he may be cited in, and the court may then proceed to hear and
determine thpcause.
When a mortgagee of real estate asserts m equity his rights as against a
tax-sale of the estate, alleged by him to have been made collusively in
conjunction with the mortgagor for the purpose of getting rid of the
mortgage for the benefit of the mortgagor, he may either proceed against
the purchaser alone, or against the purchaser and the mortgagor, and in
any event it is not necessary for him to make tender of the payment of
the amount of the tax for which the estate was sold.
The provision in the constitution of Louisiana declaring a tax-title to be
pmma facie valid is intended to be applied to cases in which the tax-title
is attacked for alleged informalities in the proceedings; but not to cases
in which it is attacked for fraud and collusion in effecting the sale.
Austin v. Citizens' Bank, 30 La. Ann. 689, approved and applied to this case.
In foreclosing a mortgage in Louisiana, the mortgagor Is entitled, in making
up the amount of the judgment, to be credited with judgments against the
mortgagee in another State whlcb have been acquired by the mortgagor.

dent of Louisiana, an undivided one-fourth of certain lands in
Carroll parish in that State, known as the Concord plantation.
The price agreed to be paid was $5123, for which the vendee
executed to the grantor his three promissory notes, the first
one for $2000, payable January 1, 1877, the second for a like
sum, payable January 1, 1878, and the third for $1123, payable January 1, 1879, each note bearing interest at the -rate of
eight per cent per annum from date until paid. In order to
secure the payment of the principal and interest of those
notes, the grantee, by the same instrument, mortgaged and
hypothecated the property for the benefit of the vendor, or
any future holder or holders of the notes, "binding and obligating himself not to sell, mortgage, or in anywise encumber
said property to the prejudice of this act of mortgage."
The deed was duly filed for record in the proper office on
the day of its date.
By an indenture executed February 10, 1876, the owners of
the Concord plantation, William, C. White, James Andrews
and Clark N. Hall, made a partition thereof among themselves.
On the 5th of March, 1882-no part of the principal sum
having been paid and the interest only having been paid up to
January 1, 1879- Clark N. Hall wrote to Mendenhall, giving
the reasons why he had not for some time made a payment.
After stating that he and his brother -had tried together to
make arrangements to meet his notes and that they had been
compelled, in order to run the plantation, to deposit what
money they had as security for aid supplied by -others, be
said "So we deposited the money we had and are goe
ahead,, and I can assure you it has given me a heap more pain
than it has you, and one more thing I can assure you, I am

On the 17th of January, 1883, the land was sold for state
and parish taxes due from Clark N. Hall for the years 1877
and 1878, and was purchased at the sum of $211.47 by Charles
F Hall, who took a deed from the sheriff.
The present suit was brought on the 4th of September, 1883,
by MLendenhall against Clark N. Hall and Charles F Hall.
After setting out the above facts in relation to the purchase
by Clark N. Hall, the execution of the notes for the price, the
partition of the plantation among the owners, and the payment of the interest up to Janu,-ry 1, 1879, the bill alleges
that Clark N. Hall had indulgence from the plaintiff from
year to year, and visited the latter at his home in Ohio about
the first of the year 1882, promising, while there, that upon
his return home lie would make a payment of $1500 on the
notes, that after his return he and his brother Charles entered into a scheme to defraud the plaintiff, that with knowledge that the sheriff would be compelled by the statute of the
State, Act No. 38 of 1882, to sell the property for unpaid
taxes within four months after the promulgation of that act,

M&ENDENHALL v. HALL.
Statement of the Case.

Clark N. Hall fraudulently failed to pay the taxes for 1,877
and 1878, although he had agreed not to encumber the property to the prejudice of the plaintiff or the said act of mortgage, and although he represented to the plaintiff that he had
paid the taxes on the land, that Clark N. Hall and Charles
F Hall agreed between themselves that, in order to defeat the
plaintiff's rights, the latter would become the purchaser at the
tax sale and take the title in his own name, intending thereby
to procure the release of the property from the plaintiff's
mortgage and privilege, and that although Charles F Hall
pretends to have bought the property and claims to be the
owner thereof, his brother was living on the plantation*and
cultivating it as before the tax sale. The bill stated various
grounds upon which the tax sale should be declared null and
void, and prayed that the sale be set aside, that the plaintiff's
mortgage and vendor's privilege to secure the balance due on
the notes, together with the accruing interest, be recognized
and rendered executory, that the land be sold, by due process
-of law, to pay and satisfy that balance, and that he might
have such relief as was proper.
Charles F Hall demurred to the bill for multifariousness,
and filed a special plea to the effect that, by article 210 of the
constitution of Louisiana, tax-titles are declared to be Irtma
facw valid, and cannot be set aside without a previous- tender
to the purchaser of the price and ten per cent per annum
interest thereon, having been made, which has not been done.
Clark N. Hall pleaded to so much of the bill as sought
judgment against him for the amount of the notes, that equity
was without jurisdiction ratione materttv to try the issues
presented on said obligations.
The court below sustained both the demurrer and the plea
of Charles F Hall,. and by a decree entered May 12, 1885,
dismissed the bill as'to him, without prejudice to the plaintiff's
right to file a new bill. It overruled the demurrer of Clark
N. Hall, and the latter filed an answer, averring that he was
no longer the owner of the premises, nor in possession thereof.
He also averred that he was the lawful owner of two judgments against the plaintiff, one for $300 and $4.15 costs taxed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Statement of the Case.

and one for $240, with interest from April 4, 1876, and $4.70
costs taxed, both rendered May 12, 1876, by a justice of the
peace in Delaware County, Ohio, in favor of the Elkart Wood
Pulp Company, against John H. Mendenhall and others,
partners doing business under the firm name of the Delaware
Paper Company
He also averred that he was the legal
holder and owner of a note for $1733.61, executed by the said
Delaware Paper Company, through their secretary, J L. Klein,
and made payable to the order of Jacob A. Sharer, who
endorsed it to James Andrews, the latter endorsing it in blank
to the ddfendant in due course of trade and for a valuable
consideration. He pleaded the said demands "in compensation of the notes sued upon."
To this answer a replication was filed, in which the plaintiff
denied that he was bound for the payment of the obligations
set up in the answer, denied that they were owned by the
defendant, and averred, in respect to the note for $1733.61,
that it was executed and obtained by fraud, was without
consideration, was never negotiated or placed on the market
until after its maturity, and was not a just debt against
the Delaware Paper Company A replication of this special
character was not in accordance with correct chancery practice. But no objection was made on that ground, and it was
treated as a proper replication.
Upon final hearing, on the 14th of April, 1886, the court
gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff against Clark N. Hall
for $5123, with interest at the rate of eight per cent per
annum from December 24, 1875, until paid, and the costs,
that amount to be credited with $1340.52 to date January 1,
1879, and also with $544.15 with eight per cent interest from
April 4, 1876, to date and take effect from May 9, 1879. It
also adjudged that the plaintiff's demand for recognition of
the mortgage and vendor's privilege claimed in the bill be
rejected as in case of non-suit without prejudice to his right
to assert the'same in a subsequent action.
[The plaintiff appealed from this decree and filed an appeal

the citation ran only to Clark N. Hall. The cause was duly
docketed here, and when reached in its order on the docket,
was submitted by the counsel for the appellant. On the 16th
of December, leave was granted to make the representative of
Charles F Hall, (who had meanwhile died,) a .party, with the
r!ght to file briefs on or before the first Monday in January
then next. On the 9th of January, 1890, the counsel fob the
admimstratrix of Clark N. Hall appeared solely for the purpose of pleading to the jurisdiction, and represented that there
had never been an appeal taken from the order dismissing \the
bill as to him. On the 18th of Tanuary, a citation issued to
Charles F Hall, or, if deceased, to his representatives, to appear
on the 4th Monday of March then next, to show cause why
the decree rendered against the appellant should not be corrected. This was served on his administratrix, and return
thereof made into court. An appearance was entered for
Charles F Hall, and a brief filed.]

of property for taxes shall be annulled for any informality in
the proceedings until the price paid, with ten per cent interest, be rendered to the purchaser."

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Argument for Appellee.

In accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, the
Supreme Court of Lomsiana, m a long line of decisions, has
held that it was a prerequisite to the. institution of a suit to
rescind a. sale, that the purchaser should be paid the price
given by him, or he should be tendered the price. Art. 1906
of the Civil Code declares "The effects of being put in default
are not only that in contracts to give the thing, which is the
object of the stipulation, is at the risk of the person in default,
but in the cases hereinafter provided for, is a prerequisite to
the recovery of damages and of profits and fruits, or to the
rescission of the contract."
A review of the decisions on this point was made in the
case of -LolaBlanton v -Ludeling et al., in 30 La. Ann. 1232.
A peremptory exception was filed to this suit, as in this case,
that no offer or tender had been made to defendant of the
amount paid by him at the tax sales at which it was alleged, in
the petition, he acquired title, and which -sums were applied
to the payments of taxes and costs due. The court said.
"We prefer to place our decision upon the exception alone,
which is no longer an open question."
In Hiller v Montagne and .FEusband, 32 La. Ann. 1290, the
Supreme Court said "Proceeding to consider what judgment should have been rendered, we admit the general principle, that a party seeking to annul a tax title, rzma fac.
valid, must first tender to the purchaser reimbursement of the
sums paid by nim in discharge. of his bid, and which enured
to the benefit of the attacking party, and this principle would,
perhaps, 'extend to proper taxes on the property paid by the
purchaser while in possession." Blanton v Zudeling, supra,
and Barrow v Lam e, 30 La. Ann. 310. In the last-mentioned case it is further said "And if this want of tender is
pleaded 17 liniine, and the amount is apparent or made to appear, plaintiff should not be allowed to sue until it is tendered."
In this case, the complainant has never offered to return
the price paid by Charles F Hall, nor has he alleged that he
haa 'done so, or was willing to do so. ie had the right, under
the law, to redeem the land within a year after the sale. This
suit was filed within the year succeeding the sale.

ENDENHALL v. BALL.
Opinion of the Court.

It -is respectfully submitted that the record, as well as the
admission made in appellant's brief already referred to, show
that there has been no appeal taken as to Charles F Hall, and
that the judgment in his favor has become -res judicta by the
expiration of the time within which an appeal might have
been taken, and that this court is without-jurisdiction over the
case as to Charles F Hall.
But, if this be not correct, then it is submitted that the evidence in this record shows that at a public sale for taxes Charles
F Hall bought the lands mortgaged and paid the taxes then
due and the costs and penalties, and that he has been in the
actual possession of said lands and paid the taxes thereon since
January, 1883, the date of the sale. The title is _nma faoie
valid. Constitution, Art. 210.
M . JusTicE HARLA", after stating the facts as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.

It is suggested that no appeal has been taken as to Charles
F Hall, and that this court is without jurisdiction over the
cause as to him. In this view we do not concur. The cause
was not finally disposed of as to Clark N. Hall, the remaining
defendant, until the 14th of April, 1886, and on the 30th day
of the same month the plaintiff was allowed an appeal "in.the
cause." His appeal bond was executed September 9, 1886, and
ran "to the defendants." The record was filed here on the
12th of. October, 1886. It appearing, when the case was
reached on our docket, that Charles F Hall had not been
served with notice of the appeal, a citation was directed to be
served upon him, or, if he was dead, upon his representative.
The citation was executed January 13, 1890, upon his widow,
who is also adminmistratrix of his estate. There is no ground
to question the jurisdiction of this cout to proceed to a hearing of the appeal. The record was filed in this court on the
day to which the appeal was returnable. Our jurisdiction did
not depend upon a citation being issued, Evans v State Bank,
ante, 330, although we could not properly proceed t& hear the
case until Charles F Hlall, as to whom the suit was dismissed

in 1885, or his representative, was brought into court by citation. Rev Civil Code La. Articles 1041, 1049, 1155, Ac Catop
v. _Fluker's Eers,12 La. Ann. 345. And the appeal brings
before us not only the final decree of 1886, but that of 1885
'sustaining the demurrer and plea of Charles F Hall, and dismissing the suit as to him. It was not necessary to take an
appeal from the latter order until after the whole case was determined in the court below For these reasons the objections
to our jurisdiction are overruled.
The first question, upon the merits, to be considered, relates
to the demurrer and plea of Charles F Hall. It is contended
that he was not a necessary party to the suit to fix the amount
of the indebtedness of Clark N. Hall, and that the demurrer,
for that reason, was properly sustained. If that had been the
sole object of the suit the plaintiff could undoubtedly have
proceeded at law against Clark N. Hall alone. But such a
suit would not have given the relief required. The plaintiff
claimed a lien on the mortgaged property to secure the paympnt of the notes given by the mortgagor. The property was
claimed by Charles F Hall in virtue of a tax sale. While the
latter might have been proceeded against alone for the purpose of determining whether his right to the land was not
subordinate to the mortgage lien, it was competent, under the
practice in equity previling in the courts of the United States,
and in order that full and adequate relief might be had, to
unite in the same suit both the mortgagor and the party
claiming the property adversely to the lien of the mortgage,
by virtue of proceedings had subsequently to its execution.
If the plaintiff was entitled to have the.property sold in satisfaction of the debt secured by the mortgage, it was his right
to have it sold freed from any apparent claim thereon wrongly
asserted -bythe holder of the tax title. Such relief could not
be had without making the latter a party to the suit.
In respect to the plea of Charles F Hall, we are of opinion
that it ought not to have been sustained. The constitutional
provisions that "all deeds of sale made. or that may be made,
by the collector of taxes, shall be received by the courts in
evidence as _prvncnfacze valid sales." and that " no sale of prop-

MENDENHALL v. HALL.
Opinion of the Court.

erty for taxes shall be annulled for any informality in the
proceedings until the price paid, with ten per cent interest, be
tendered to the purchaser," have no application to cases like the
present one. If Clark N$.Hall had attempted to have the tax
sale set aside for mere informality, it would have been a good
plea in bar to any suit by him against the purchaser, that he
had not tendered the amount paid by him, with interest thereon
-the plea showing distinctly the amount so paid. Barrow
v Lapene, 30 La. Ann. 310, Blanton v Ludeling,30 La. Ann.
1232. It is to suits of that character that the authorities cited
apply The case before us is altogether different. It proceeds
upon the ground that a mortgagor who had agreed" not to sell,
mortgage or in anywise encumber the property," to the prejudice of the mortgage, had fraudulently combined with his
brother to defeat the mortgage lien by means of a sale for
taxes due from the mortgagor, at which sale the brother was to
bid in the property, in his own name, and for the protection of
the mortgagor, assert his absolute ownership of it. It certainly was not intended that the mortgagee, in order to maintain a suit to enforce his lien, should tender to the mortgagor,
.or to his agent, the amount of the taxes, with interest thereon,
the non-payment of which by the mortgagor had caused the
sale to the prejudice of the mortgagee.
The case, in many respects, is like Austin v. Citwzens' Bank
and Slernf, 30 La. Ann. 689, in which it appeared- that a
mortgage creditor proceeded directly against the mortgaged
property which had been sold for taxes, and the title taken
in the name of a third person. The holder of the tax title
brought a suit to enjoin such proceeding. The court said
"The plaintiff [the holder of tax title] entrenches himself behind our ruling nf' Lannes v Workngmenw's Ban, 29 ]La.
Ann. 112, and insists that his title must be held good until it
is annulled in a direct action. But that principle holds good
only as to those titles that are bonafde, and are acquired with"ut-fraud, or that are real and not simulated. Unquestionably
a purchaser at a tax sale may acquire a good title to a valuable
.property -or a small pyice, if the requisite formalities have preceded *nd attended the sale.
But no government will

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

permit its machinery, constructed to enforce the payment of
public dues to the fisc, to be used to manipulate a fraud, and
if the purchaser is a party to the fraud he must share its punishment. It might be very different if he were wholly disconnected and unacquainted with it. The purchase by Moss was
nothing more or less than a purchase by Mrs. Austin, the
debtor and mortgagor, through her son, the plaintiff. The
money paid as the price at the tax sale was only what she, as
the owner of the property, owed the State,. and what she honestly and in good conscionce ought to have paid without, and
before, and to prevent a sale. If she could not pay it, the
debt being exzgeane and of so high a rank, she should have
acquainted her creditor and mortgagee with its imminence, instead of observing the suspicious reticence which characterized
her conduct. The creditor's rights, as mortgagee and vendor,
cannot be imperilled by the mortgagor's collusive combination
with others to interpose an apparent but fraudulent obstacle
in his way in enforcing those rights."
All that was said in that case is pertinent to the one before
us. The mortgagor had obtained liberal indulgence as to
time from the mortgagee. He made such representations of
his embarrassed financial condition as induced the mortgagee
to forbear taking steps to enforce his lien upon the property
lie gave positive assurances that he would make a payment
of twenty-five hundred dollars on the mortgage debt by the
fall of 1882. He knew that there were taxes upon the property which it was his duty to pay, and that their non-payment
endangered the security upon which his generous creditor
depended for the payment of the notes given for the property
And his brother, with many expressions of friendship for the
mortgagee and his family, joined in the appeals for time,
assuring the mortgagee that he would himself assist in meetMg the mortgagor's engagements to pay, if the mortgagee
would wait until January 1, 1883. HIe voluntarily promised
that he would keep the mortgagee "posted about things."
But neither the mortgagor nor his brother informed the inortgagee that the land was advertised to be sold for the taxes
which the mortgagor was unaer a duty to pay The way in

MENDENHALL v. HALL.
Opinion of the Court.

which Charles F Hall complied with his promise to keep the
plaintiff posted was to withhold information as to the tax sale,
buy the land for the amount of the taxes, and take the title in
his own name. The evidence leaves no doubt that the nonpayment of taxes by the mortgagor, and the purchase of the
property by his brother, was in execution of a scheme upon
their part to defeat the mortgagor's lien upon the land.
In respect to the credits allowed by the decree below upon
his notes to the mortgagor," no error was committed. The
credit of $1340.52, as of January 1, 1879, was a trifling amount
in excess of the aggregate interest that had been paid by the
mortgagor up to that date. The credit of $544.15 was for the
amount of the two judgments rendered against Mendenhall by
a justice of the peace m Ohio, of which Clark N. Hall became
the owner on the 9th of May, 1879. The plaintiff being a
non-resident of Louisiana, it was proper to allow that amount
as a set off against the notes. Spmney v HIyde, 16 La. Ann.
250, TWoolfolk v Shqp Grahan's.Polly, 18 La. Ann. 693. As
to the note for $1733.61, dated June 1, 1875, and executed by
the Delaware Paper Company, the court below properly disallowed it as a set off. The evidence clearly showed that it was
not an enforceable obligation against that company The
attempt to -use it against Mendenhall is only additional evidence of the purpose to defraud him. But, for the reasons
stated, the court below erred in rejecting the plaintiff's demand
for recognition of the mortgage lien upon the property
