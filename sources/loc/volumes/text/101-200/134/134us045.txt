court.
These are appeals from orders of the Circuit Court remanding the above-entitled cases to the state court, which appeals
the records show were "granted under the. provisions of the
act'of February 25, 1889, on the ground that the court has no
unsdiction of the cause."

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

Before the act of 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, we held that an
order by the Circuit Court remanding a cause was not such a
final judgment or decree m a civil action as to give us jurisdiction for its review by writ of error or appeal. The appropriate remedy in such a case was then, by mandamus, to compel the Circuit Court to hear and decide. Babbitt v Clark,
103 U. S. 606, 609., Turner v Farmer's Zoan and Trust
Company, 106 TL S. 552, 555, Railroad Company v Wiswall,
23 Wall. 507. The act of 1875 made such order reviewable
(without regard to the pecuniary value of the matter in dispute), but by the act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, 555,
c, 373, as cqrrected by the act of August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433,
c. 866, the provision to that effectwas repealed, and it was also
provided that no appeal or writ of error should be allowed
from the decision of the Circuit Court remanding a.cause. In
.Morey v Lockhart, 123 U. S.56, 57, Mr. Chief Justice Waite,
speaking for the court, said "It is difficult to see what more
could be done to make the action of the Circuit Court final, for
all the purposes of the.removal, and not the subject of review
in this court. First, it is declared that -there shall be no appeal
or writ of error in such a case, and then, to make the matter
doubly sure, the only statute which ever gave the right of such
an appeal or writ of error is repealed." And the court held
that the language of the act was broad enough to cover all
cases, and also that an appeal or writ of error would not lie
under ยง 693 of the Revised Statutes, because that section ap.plied only to final judgments or decrees, and an order remanding was not a final judgment.
The act of February 25, 1889, 25 Stat. 693, c. 236, provides
that "in all cases where a final judgment or decree shall be
rendered in a Circuit Court of the United -States in which
there shall have been a question involving the jurisdiction of
the court, the party against whom the judgment or decree is
rendered shall be entitled to an appeal or writ of error to
the Supreme Court of the United States to review such judgment or decree, without reference to the amount of the same,
but in cases where the decree or-judgment does not.exceed the
sum of five thousand dollars the Supreme Court shall not re-
