RICH v. MENTZ TOWNSHIP
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 229. Argued March 25, 1890.-Decided April 14, 1890.

Where a majority of the taxpayers of a town are authorized by statute to
encumber the property of all, in aid of a railroad or other corporation,
the record must show that the statutory authority has been pursued.
The statute of New York of May-I,

1869, 2 Sess. Laws of 1869, 2303, au-

thorized a county judge, on the petition of a "majority of the taxpayers
of any municipal corporation," verified by the oath of one of the petitioners, for the issue of bonds of the corporation in aid of a railroad, to
take jurisdiction and to proceed, as provided under the act, to determine
whether the bonds should be issued. In 1871 this statute was amended,
2 Sess. Laws 1871, 2115, so as to confer that jirisdiction only when the
application was made by "a majority of the taxpayers" of the municipal

corporation, "not including those taxed for dogs or highway tax only."

RICH v. MEKTZ.
Statement of the Case.
The town of Mentz issued its bonds for such a purpose'on an application
made after the act of 1871 took effect, but which in-language complied
with the act of 1869 only. The Court of Appeals of the State of New
York held these bonds to be void for non-compliance with the provisions
of the act of 1871, and, following the decisions-of that court it is now
Held, that the bonds sued upon by the plaintiff in error are void.
Upon questions similar to the issues in this suit.the decisions of the highest
3udicial tribunal of 1 state are entitled to great, and ordinarily decisive
weight.
There being on the face of the bonds suedl upon an entire want of power to
issue them, no reference need be made to the doctrine-'estoppel.

THis was an action brought by George L. Rich in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of
New York, against the town of Mentz, to recover the amount
of sixty interest coupons attached to certain bonds held by
him, and alleged to have been issued by the town on July 15,
1872, in aid of the Cayuga Northern Railroad Company
The cause was tried by the circuit and district judges, a
jury being duly waived, and the court made its special findings
as follows
"I. On the 18th day of July, 1872, there was filed in the
clerk's office of the county of Cayuga, N. Y., the judgment of
the county judge of said county, with the petition of certain

of Mentz, which was presented to the county judge of Cayuga
County, in the State of New York, on the 28th day of M ay,

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
Where a majority of the taxpayers of a town are authorized
by statute to encumber the property of all, in aid of a railroad or other corporation. the record must show that the
statutory authority has been pursued. Cowdrey v Caneadea,
16 Fed. Rep. 532, and cases cited.
Section 1 of chapter 907 of the laws of New York of 1869,
2 Sess. Laws 1869, p. 2303, was as follows "Whenever a
majority of the taxpayers of any municipal corporation in
this State, whose names appear upon the last preceding taxlist or assessment-roll of said corporation as owning or.representing a majority of the taxable property in the corporate
limits of such. corporation, shall make application to the
county judge of the county in which such corporation is
situated, by petition, verified by one of the petitioners, setting
forth that they are such a majority of taxpayers and represent
such a majority of taxable property, and that they desire
that such municipal corporation shall create and issue its
bonds to an amount named in such petition," etc.
That section was so amended by § _, c. 925 of the laws of
New York of 1871, 2 Sess. Laws 1871, 2115, as to read
"Whenever a majority of the taxpayers of any municipal
corporation in this State who are taxed or assessed for propertv, not including those taxed for dogs or highway tax oniy,
upon the last preceding assessment-roll or tax-list of said corporation, and who are assessed or taxed, or represent a majority of the taxable property, upon said last assessment-roll
or tax-list, shall make application to the county judge of the
county in which such municipal corporation is situate, by
petition, verified by one of the petitioners, setting forth that
they are such majority of taxpayers, and are taxed or assessed for or represent such majority of taxable property, and

RIGH .v. MENTZ.
Opinion of the Court.

that they desire etc., etc.

The words 'municipal

corporation' when used in this act shall be construed to mean

any city, town or incorporated village in this State, and the
word 'taxpayer' shall mean.any corporation or person assessed or taxed for property either individually or as agent,
trustee, guardian, executor or administrator, or who shall
have been intended to have been thus taxed, and shall have
paid or are liable to pay the tax as hereinbefore provided, or
the owner'of any non-resident lands taxed as such, not including those taxed for dogs or highway tax only, and the
words I tax-list or assessment-rofl' when used m this act shall
mean the tax-list or assessment-roll of said municipal corporation last completed before the first presentation of such petition to the judge."
The bonds in controversy expressly recite that they are
issued under the act of 1869, and the petition and adju4ication
almost literally followed the language of. that act, although
.section 1 of chapter 925 of the laws of 1871 had been .substituted for section 1 of chapter 907 of the act of 1869, before
the proceeding was had. The result is that the petition did
not sufficiently conform to the statute of 1871. to call for the
exercise of judicial judgment on the part of the county judge,
and the adjudication was equally defective, The act of 187.1
defined the class of persons who were authorized-to petition;
as a majbrity of the'taxpayers, "who -are taxed or assessed for
property, not including those taxed for dogs or highway tax
only, upon the last preceding assessment-roll or tax-list of said
corporation, and who are assessed or taxed, or represent a
majority of the taxable property, upon said last assessmentroll or tax-list." The statement of the. jurisdictional facts m
the petition required the averment that the petitioners were a
majority of such taxpayers as were defined in the act. This
must appear affirmatively on the face of the petition. The
act expressly provides that the petition shall set forth that the
petitioners are "1s'uck majority of taxpayers, and are" taxed or
assessed .for or represent such majority-of taxable property"
The word "taxpayers" would not exclude those "taxed for
dogs or highway tax only," and the petition must show-that
VOL. cxxxiV- 41

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

the petitioners are a majority, exclusive of the latter class.
And this the petition here does not do, nor does the judgment of the county judge. It is provided by the act of 1871,
as it had been by that of 1869, that it shall be the duty of the
county judge, at the time and place named in the notice given
as prescribed, to proceed and take proof as to the allegations
an said petition, and if it shall appear satisfactorily to him that
the petitioners, and such other taxpayers as may then join in
the application, do represent a majority of the taxpayers and
a majority of the taxable property, he shall render judgment
accordingly, which being entered of record in the office of the
clerk of the county, shall have the same force and effect as
other judgments in courts of record in the State, subject to
review by certoram, and it is forcibly argued that the judg
ment of the county judge is not open to collateral attack. But
this assumes that the jurisdiction of the county judge has been
properly invoked, and has no application where that is not the
case. Proof as to the allegations of this petition may have
been taken, but such proof did not necessarily involve an inquiry into whether a part of the petitioning taxpayers were
such because of the payment of highway taxes or taxes on
dogs. and, as we have said, the judgment does not in terms
show that s~ch were not included. So that if the county
judge had been charged with the ascertainment of the jursdictional facts, the proceedings do not show that those facts
were ascertained.
The fourth section-of the act of 1871 contains, among other
things, this provision "On review, persons taxed for dogs
or highway tax only shall not be counted as taxpayers, unless
that claim was made before the county judge." If this means,
as counsel for plaintiff in error insists, that the objection
when urged on review shall not prevail unless it had been
taken before the county judge, it does not weaken but confirms the view that the verified petition must state 'that those
who sign it are not taxpayers on dogs- and for highways
merely The circuit judge, in his opinion in this case, correctly observes
"It is insisted that, because the amended act of 1871

IICH v. MANTZ.
O(pmnon -of -the Court.

defines the term 'taxpayer,' 'when used in this act,' to mean
-such taxpayers as are not assessed for dogs or highway tax
only, it is not necessary to comply with the explicit language
of the act as to the form and substance of the petition. The
petition is the basis and groundwork of the whole bonding
proceeding. When the amended act was passed many of
these proceedings had been set aside by the courts of this
State because of defects of form in the petition, and it was
the well-settled law of the state courts that, any such defect
was jurisdictional, and rendered the whole proceeding futile.
Speaking of the act of 1869, the Court of Appeals said in
Peaple v Smit , 45 N. Y 712 ' The authority conferred by
the act must be exercised in strict conformity to, and -by a
rigid compliance with, the letter and spirit of the statute.'
The first section of the amended act provides, in language as
explicit as could be employed, that the petition, verified by
one of the petitioners, shall set forth that the petitioners are
a niajority of taxpayers of the -town who are -taxed or
assessed for property, ' not including those taxed for dogs or
highway tai only' It subsequently provides that the word
' taxpayer,' 'when used in this. act,' shall mean 'any corporation or person assessed or taxed for property, .,
not
including those taxed for dogs or highway tax only' *Section
2 makes it the duty of the county judge ' to proceed and take
proof as to the said allegations in the petition; ' and if he finds
that the requisite majority of taxpayers tave consented, he
shall so adjudge. If there were no express -provision reqmring it to appear in the petition that the taxpayers who apply
are a majority of the designated class, the petition would
doubtless be sufficient if it alleged that they were a majority
of the taxpayers'of the town, and m this view, there was no
need of amending the act of 1869 in this behalf. If the argument for the plaintiff is sound -this explicit provision is meabingless. It is not to be assumed that the legislature did not
mean anything by the language which they so carefully
employed. It is not difficult to apprehend what the legislature
meant by defining the word 'taxpayer.' It occurs several
times in the act, It was defined for convenience, in order to

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinon of the Court.

avoid repetition of description whenever the word was used in
the act, and in order that there should be no room for doubt
what kind of a taxpayer was meant whenever the word was
used."
These views are in accordance with repeated adjudications
of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in construing this statute, and upon questions of this chaxacter, when
arising as here, the decisions of the lnghest judicial tribunal
of a State are entitled to great and ordinarily decisive weight.
AMeniwether v Auhlenberg County Court, 120 U. S. 354, 357,
Claiborne County v Brooks, 111 U. S. 400, 410. In Town of
Mentz v Cook, 108 N. Y 504, 509, the court says "The
petition was presented after the amendment of 1871 to the act
of 1869, and was defective in not averring that the petitioners
were a majority of the taxpayers of the town of Mentz, excluding those taxed for dogs or -highway tax only
The fatal
character of the defect has been so adjudged m this court as
to end further discussion.
Green v Smith, 55 N. Y 135,
Town of Wellsboro v N Y Central &c. Railroad-Co., 76
N. Y 182, fetzger v Atti a & Arcade Railroad,79 N. Y 171.
Our attention has heretofore been drawn (Hills v Peekskill
Savings Bank, 101 -W. Y 490) to the definition of the word
' taxpayers,' given in section 1 of the act of 1871, and to the
fact that such definition and its effect had never been directly
passed upon by this court. The argument advanced is that
the word 'taxpayers,' as used in the act, is declared to mean
taxpayers exclusive of those taxed for dogs or highway tax
only, and that it is illogical to deny to the word, when used in
a petition under the act, the meaning ascribed to it by the act
itself. The suggestion is by no means conclusive, and admits
of a satisfactory answer. The definition was given to avoid
useless repetition, and is confined to its use m the act itself.
The petition is required to be verified, and to show on its face
fhe consent of the requisite majority, and is not satisfied by
an ambiguous oath, true in one sense and not true in another."
As on the face of these proceedings there was an entire
want of power to issue the bonds, no reference to the doctrine
of estoppel need be made. We answer the first and third
