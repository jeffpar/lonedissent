OCTOBER TERM, 1905.
Opinion of the Court.

200 U. S.

Green, 159 U. S. 651; Tennessee v. Condon, 189 U. S. 64; Jones
v. Montague, 194 U. S. 147.
It would seem to be plain that the cancelation of a revocation of a permit, when the permit itself has become of no effect
by virtue of the lapse of time, would be useless business, and
would give no practical relief to the company.
Writ dismissed.
