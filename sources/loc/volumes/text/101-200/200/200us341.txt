SOUTHERN PACIFIC v. UNITED STATES (NO. 1). 341
Statement of the Case.

200 U. S.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 141.

Argued January 24, 1906.-Decided February 19, 1906.

Although a suit in equity cannot be maintained where there is an adequate
remedy at law, and this objection may be taken for the first time in the
appellate court, still, if not raised until then, the court need not, if the
subject matter of the suit is of a class over which it has jurisdiction, dismiss the bill; and so held in regard to a suit brought by the Government,
under an act of Congress, to recover from a railroad company the value of
lands erroneously patented to and sold by it to numerous persons, some
of whom were made defendants as representatives of the class, the bill
also praying for cancellation of patents, quieting of titles, discovery and
accounting.
Discovery, although now seldom the object of a suit in equity, and not
always sufficient to uphold a suit when the full information is obtainable
by proceedings at law, was a well-recognized ground of equity jurisdiction.
When by mistake a tract of land is conveyed, and the vendee prior to discovery of the mistake, conveys to a bona fide purchaser, the original owner
is not limited to a suit to cancel the conveyances and redstablish his own
title, but may elect to confirm the title of the innocent purchaser and
recover of his own vendee the value of the land up to at least the sum
received by him. The conveyance to the innocent purchaser is equivalent
to a conversion of personal property.
The acts of March 3, 18S7, 24 Stat. 556, of February 12, 1896, 29 Stat. 6,
and of March 2, 1896, 29 Stat. 42, do not in providing for adjustment
of railroad land grants, amount to a taking of the railroad companies'
property without compensation because they confirm sales made to bona
fide purchasers of lands erroneously patented to railroad companies and
require such companies to account for and pay to the Government the
amounts received by them from such purchasers up to the regular Government price.

Tins was a suit begun in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of California, by bill filed
April 13, 1899. The parties named as defendants were the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the trustees in certain
mortgages, and a number of individuals sued as representatives

of a class. In a general way it may be said that the bill averred
that a large body of lands, some thirty thousand acres and
over, had been erroneously patented to the railroad company,
and that portions thereof had been conveyed by it to bona fide
purchasers. The relief sought was the confirmation of the
titles of bona fide purchasers, the cancellation of the patents
to the other lands, and the recovery from the railroad company of the value of the lands conveyed by it to bona fide purchasers in accordance with the terms of the acts of Congress
of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 556; February 12, 1896, 29 Stat.
6; March 2, 1896, 29 Stat. 42, providing for the adjustment of
railroad land grants. After answers by the railroad company and some of the individual defendants, proofs were taken,
and upon a hearing a decree was entered which in separate
paragraphs specifically confirmed the titles to the several
tracts held by bona fide purchasers, and adjudged that the
United States recover from the railroad company the value
of those lands, a sum amounting in the aggregate to $33,596.92.
117 Fed. Rep. 544. This decree was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals (66 C. C. A. 581; 133 Fed. Rep. 651), from whose
decision the railroad company and the trustees appealed to
this court.
Mr. Maxwell Evarts for appellants:
As complainant had a complete remedy at law there is no
jurisdiction of the case in equity. The case is nothing more
than an action of debt, Litchfield v. Ballou, 114 U. S. 190,
and a judgment at law would be the exact equivalent of what
complainant could obtain in the suit. Lewis v. Cocks, 23
Wall. 466; Killian v. Ebbinghaus, 110 U. S. 568, 574; Allen
v. Pullman Co., 139 U. S. 658; Mills v. Knapp, 39 Fed. Rep.

No patent is sought to be avoided nor any multiplicity of
suits. No ground of equitable jurisdiction can be suggested.
The case is not difficult or complex. Lacombe v. Forstal, 123
U. S. 562, 570; United States v. Winona R. R. Co., 165 U. S.
463, 481. Nor does the fact that discovery and an accounting
is sought justify going into equity. Ex parte Boyd, 105
U. S. 647; Tiedeman on Eq. Jur., 1893, § 550. And as to
accounting not justifying equity jurisdiction see French v.
Hay, 22 Wall. 231.
The act of Congress of March 2, 1896, so far as it purports
to give a right of action in favor of the United States to recover the Government price of all land erroneously patented
to the railroad and sold by it to bona fide purchasers is unconstitutional.
The United States might confirm the title to such purchasers
or it might cancel their patents, but the railroad company was
not a party to the passage of the act, and without its consent
the United States could not confirm the title and compel the
railroad company to pay the Government any part of the
amount received therefor.
The passage of the act amounted to a judicial finding that
the railroad company owed the Government, and that $1.25
per acre was the measure of damages. This was a judicial
finding beyond the legislative power of Congress. United
States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 11 Blatchf. 385, 392; aff'd

process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution and its construction as in the present
case to create an indebtedness out of past transactions, when
no such indebtedness before existed, would make it unconstitutional.
Mi. Joseph H. Call, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, for the United States:
Defendants having answered to the merits without demurrer or plea to the jurisdiction in equity, and put the Government to the expense of taking of testimony, they have
waived any right to object to the final determination in this
cause, as one in equity, the court having power to grant the
relief sought. Brown v. Lake Superior Co., 134 U. S. 530,
535; Insley v. United States, 150 U. S. 512; Perrego v. Dodge,
163 U. S. 160; Kilbourn v. Sunderland, 130 U. S. 505,
514.
This bill is cognizable in equity as one to relieve against a
mistake and error in issuing patents to defendant for lands
not granted by the act of Congress, and to establish a trust
against and accounting for the proceeds of sales of such lands,
they or most of them having been sold to bona fide purchasers.
Equity not only takes jurisdiction but will grant the relief
sought.
These lands were excepted from the grant to the defendant
railroad by the terms of the acts of March 3, 1871, and July 27,
1866, and were erroneously patented to the Southern Pacific.

The jurisdiction in such cases is maintained in equity as arising in fraud, accident or mistake.
The United States also has a right to maintain a bill in
equity to quiet and determine title to lands claimed adversely
to the Government.
Section 738, Stat. California, Code of Civ. Pro., authorizes
suits in equity to quiet and determine title to lands. Pennie v.

Where it is impracticable to make all the persons who are
interested parties defendant, the court may proceed to a final
decree, where such persons are sufficiently represented by
others. The defendants before the court fairly represent a
class of purchasers claiming protection under the acts of 1887
and 1896, and the courts below so found, and in such a case
the court may proceed to a final decree. Equity Rules, 48;

This is a constitutional exercise of power by Congress and
creates an additional and new ground of equity which may be
administered. Holland v. Challen, 110 U. S. 15; Arndt v.
Griggs, 134 U. S. 316, 320; Bardon v. Land Co., 157 U. S. 327,
330; Cowley v. Railroad Co., 159 U. S. 569, 583.
Where land or other property has been transferred from one
to another wrongfully or under a mistake, the court will establish and construct a trust in the property, and in its proceeds,
in favor of the beneficiary, and against the person wrongfully
holding it, and will require the trustee to return the property
or its value.
It was not within the intention of the United States to convey the lands to the defendant, and that intent is shown by
the granting act. The defendant is therefore bound in equity
to reconvey the lands to the United States if still within its
power to do so, and if not, then to pay to the United States
what it received for them or their reasonable value. Chapman

Argument for the United States.

The jurisdiction in equity in this case is sustained because
the final relief sought and the mode of obtaining it is more
efficient than in a court of law. Cases supra and Oelrichs v.
Spain, 15 Wall. 211, 228; Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, 11, 50;
Chicago Railroad v. Union Pac. Railroad,47 Fed. Rep. 15, 26;
United States v. Union Pac. Railroad, 50 Fed. Rep. 28, 43.
The legislation of Congress, acts of 1866 and 1871, for the
construction of the railroad, its public uses, grant of lands,
and their sale by the road, and requiring repayment of value
of lands erroneously patented as required by the acts of 1887
and 1896, shows that the railroad company was a trustee of
the Government for those purposes. United States v. Michigan, 190 U. S. 379; California v. Southern Pacific Railroad,
127 U. S. 1.
And the power and right to consummate those ends were
franchises conferred by the United States for National purposes.
Where a court of equity takes jurisdiction of a cause upon
one ground, pertaining either to its exclusive or concurrent
jurisdiction, it will retain it to do complete justice, even
to granting legal remedies. Ober v. Gallagher, 93 U. S. 199;
Root v. Railway, 105 U. S. 189, 205; Ward v. Todd, 103 U. S.
327; Hopkins v. Grimshaw, 165 U. S. 342, 358; Smyth v. Ames,

U. S. 481, distinguished. See Oregon Railroad v. United
States, 189 U. S. 103, 115.
The acts of March 3, 1887, and March 2, 1896, requiring
repayment for lands erroneously patented and sold to bona
fide purchasers are amendatory of the act of 1866 and authorized by the provision reserved to alter, amend or repeal the
act of July 27, 1866. Cases supra and Shields v. Ohio, 95
U. S. 319; United States v. Oregon Railroad, 176 U. S. 47, 48.
The Southern Pacific Company has fully accepted the benefits of the acts of 1887, and 1896, and is bound by their obligations. Danielsv. Tearney, 102 U. S. 415, 421; GrandRapids

fact that the company accepted the provisions of this act and
claimed its benefits, not alone in this suit, but in other litigations between the United States and the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company.
Lands within the granted limits of the Atlantic and Pacific
grant of July 27, 1866, cannot be taken by the Southern Pacific
as indemnity under its grant of same date or later grant of
March 3, 1871. United States v. Southern Pacific Railroad,
146 U. S. 570, 615, 619; Southern Pacific Railroad v. United
States, 168 U. S. 1, 46, 47; Germania Iron Co. v. United States,
165 U. S. 379, 383.
These lands described in the bill were set apart by act of
Congress for the construction of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, and as these lands were granted to another railroad than
the Southern Pacific for another and different object of internal
improvement, the Southern Pacific cannot obtain any benefit
from that grant, or by taking indemnity for them, which would
amount to the same thing. Southern Pacific v. United States,
168 U. S. 1, 47; Clark v. Herrington, 186 U. S. 206, 208; Southe Pacific v. United States, 189 U. S. 147, 452; Chicago Railroad v. United States, 159 U. S. 372; Sioux City Railroad v.

Neither the dismissal of the lands in this suit from a former
litigation, nor the adjudication in such former litigation, as to
the rights and claims of the Southern Pacific under its grants,
nor the adjudication of title to other lands, estops the Government from maintaining this bill.
MR. JUsTICE BREWER,

after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC v. UNITED STATES (NO. 1). 349
200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The appellants challenge the decree on two grounds: First,
that a suit in equity cannot be maintained, because there is a
plain, adequate and complete remedy at law; and, second, that
the United States camnot by legislation create an obligation
of the railroad company for the value of the land patented
to and conveyed by it to bona fide purchasers.
No objection was made to the jurisdiction of the court as a
court of equity by any pleading or before the hearing. It is
undoubtedly true that a suit in equity cannot be maintained
when there is a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law.
Such is the mandate of the Revised Statutes, § 723, as well
as the general rule in equity. Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466;
Killian v. Ebbinghaus, 110 U. S. 568; Litchfield v. Ballou,
114 U. S. 190; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Company, 139
U. S. 658. It is also true that this objection need not always
be raised by some pleading, but may be presented on the hearing even in the appellate court, and if not suggested by counsel
may be enforced by the court on its own motion. See authorities just cited. But on the other hand it is equally true that
where the objection that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy
at law is not made until the hearing, and the subject matter
is of a class over which a court of equity has jurisdiction, the
court is not necessarily obliged to entertain it, even though
if taken in limine it might have been worthy of attention.

1 Daniell's Chan. P1. & Pr. (4th ed.), p. 555. It is necessary,
therefore, to notice more in detail the allegations in the bill.
That sets forth land grants to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
the Texas Pacific Railroad Company. It shows the acceptance by the Altantic and Pacific Company of its grant, the
filing of its maps of definite location, a failure to complete its
road within the State of California, an act of Congress forfeit-

ing the lands along the line of said road within that State, a
claim of the Southern Pacific Company to some of those lands,
the erroneous patenting of them to that company, a demand for
a reconveyance, and the acts of Congress in respect to the
adjustment of railroad land grants. The bill further alleges
that more than one thousand persons, among whom are the
individual defendants named in the bill, who are sued as representatives of the class, had purchased by immediate or mesne
conveyances from the Southern Pacific Company certain of
those lands specifically described in Exhibit A; that all these
purchasers claim an interest in the lands, but the nature and
extent of their claims are unknown; that a prior suit, brought
to vacate and annul patents, included those lands, and had
been dismissed as to them without prejudice, upon the claim
of the Southern Pacific Company that it had conveyed them
to bona fide purchasers. In an amendment to the bill is a
prayer (in order to secure an accounting with the railroad
company) for a statement of the sales of these tracts, with the
names of the purchasers, dates of sales, purchase prices and
amounts paid. The bill also alleges that there is a dispute
between the railroad company and the persons purchasing or
contracting with it in respect to the validity of the title conveyed, or attempted to be conveyed, by the company; avers
that the United States has no desire to question the title of
bona fide purchasers, but on the contrary seeks to have such
title confirmed. It prays for a determination of the tracts
sold to bona fide purchasers, to the end that the titles thereto
may be confirmed, for a decree vacating and annulling the
patents for any lands not so sold, and quieting the title of the
United States thereto, and that the railroad company be required to account to the United States for the value of the
lands sold to bona fide purchasers, or such sum as had been
received by the company from those sales, not exceeding $1.25
per acre, and for such other and further relief as is just and
equitable.
It is contended by the railroad company that this is merely

SOUTHERN PACIFIC v. UNITED STATES (NO. 1). 351
200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

an action in assumpsit to recover the amount claimed to be
due for the lands patented to and sold by it to bona fide purchasers. But this ignores the full scope of the suit. The bill
asked cancellation of the patents and a quieting of the title
of the plaintiff to those lands still held by the company, or
not sold to bona fide purchasers. It prayed a discovery of all
sales and conveyances, rith the dates of the sales and the
amounts received thereon. It also sought a confirmation
specifically of the titles of bona fide purchasers, and finally an
accounting with and recovery from the company. A cancellation of patents and a quieting of title is obtainable in equity.
Hughcs v. United States, 4 Wall. 232; Moore v. Robbins, 96
U. S. 530; Mullan v. United States, 118 U. S. 271; Williams v.
United States, 138 U. S. 514; Germania Iron Company v.
United States, 165 U. S. 379. It is true no decree was entered
for the cancellation of any patents, and tfiat matter was thus
eliminated from the litigation. But the confirmation of the
title of specific tracts to bona fide purchasers, which did pass
into decree, is equally within the jurisdiction of a court of
equity. While discovery is now seldom the object of a suit
in equity, and doubtless would not uphold such a suit when
the full information was obtainable by proceedings at law, yet
it was a well recognized ground of equity jurisdiction, Kennedy
v. Creswell, 101 U. S. 641, 645; 1 Story's Eq. Jur., 11th ed.,
sees. 689 and following; 1 Pomeroy's Eq. Jur. sec. 193 and
cases cited in notes, and whether in any given case a court of
equity would be justified in acting is a question for its deternnation. It is unnecessary to determine whether, if properly
challenged, the allegations in this bill were sufficient. Possibly
not. United States v. Bitter Root Development Company, decided this day, post, p. 451. It is enough that discovery was
sought, that discovery is not obtainable in an action at law,
but only in a suit in equity. It may be that in order to support
a recovery from the railroad company it was not necessary
that there be a formal confirmation of the titles of the purchasers from it, or that the purchasers be made parties defend-

ant, yet it was competent for the court under the pleadings
to enter such a decree, and the Government was justified in
asking for it. Indeed, such action seems to have been contemplated by the statute, for in the second section of the act
of March 2, 1896, it is provided: "An adverse decision by the
Secretary of the Interior on the bona fides of such claimant
shall not be conclusive of his rights, and if such claimant, or
one claiming to be a bona fide purchaser, but who has not submitted his claim to the Secretary of the Interior, is made a
party to such suit, and if found by the court to be a bona fide
purchaser, the court shall decree a confirmation of the title,
and shall render a decree in behalf of the United States against
the patentee, corporation, company, person, or association of
persons for whose benefit the certification was made for the
value of the land as hereinbefore provided."
If only an action at law had been brought to recover the
value of these lands from the railroad company, unless the
verdict had been for the full amount claimed, $1.25 an acre,
or unless there had been specific findings of fact showing the
particular tracts on account of which recovery was given, it
would be open to grave doubt whether any titles would be
confirmed, even by inference, and a cloud would be left hanging over the titles of each of these purchasers. Clearly the
case here presented was within the jurisdiction of a court of
equity, and if there was any objection to that jurisdiction it
should have been made in lirmine and not after pleadings had
been perfected and proofs taken.
Passing to the other question, it is charged in the bill that
these statutes constituted a valid contract between the Government and the railroad company. Now whether that be
strictly true we need not stop to consider. It is enough that
upon the facts the Government was entitled to recover from
the company. Erroneously and by mistake the officers of the
Government executed patents to the railroad company conveying the legal title to the lands. The railroad company accepted such title and subsequently conveyed the lands to

SOUTHERN PACIFIC v. UNITED STATES (NO. 1). 353

Opinion of the Court.

parties who dealt with it in good faith. When by mistake a
tract of land is erroneously conveyed, so that the vendee has
obtained a title which does not belong to him, and before the
mistake is discovered the vendee conveys to a third party
purchasing in good faith, the original owner is not limited to
a suit to cancel the conveyances and reestablish in himself the
title, but he may recover of his vendee the value of the land
up to at least the sum received on the sale, and thus confirm
the title of the innocent purchaser. The conveyance to the
innocent purchaser is equivalent to a conversion of personal
property. Irrespective, therefore, of the act of Congress the
Government had the right, when it found that these lands had
been erroneously patented to the railroad company and by
it sold to persons who dealt with it in good faith, to sue the
railroad company and recover the value of the lands so wrongfully received and subsequently conveyed. The acts of Congress really inure to the benefit of the railroad company and
restrict the right of the Government, for they provide that the
recovery shall in no case be more than the minimum Government price. In other words, the Government asks only its
minimum price for public land, no matter what the value of
the tracts or the amounts received by the company may be.
It may be noticed in this connection that in no case was the
value of any land sold fixed in the decree above the sum received by the company therefor, and that in many instances
that sum exceeded the minimum price of 81.25 per acre. It
may also be noticed that by stipulation it appears that within
the indemnity limits there still remains a large body of lands
from which the railroad company can select lands in lieu of
those involved in the suit.
We see nothing in this decision of which the railroad company can complain. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
