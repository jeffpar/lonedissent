Statement of the Case.

OMPATY v. UNITED
EASTERN RAILROAD
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAMS.
Wo. 134. Argued January22, 23, 189.-

Decided February 4, 1889.

Prior to the expiration, June 30, 1877, of a written contract with a railroad
company for carrying the mails, the Postmaster General, acting under
provisions of law, notified the company in writing that from the day of
that expiration to a day which made a term of four years, the compensation would be at rates named m the notice, "unless otherwise ordered."
The company transported the mails, and accepted pay therefor at those
rates, without objection. On the 1st July, 1878, the Postmaster General
reduced the rates 5 per cent under the provisions of an act of Congress
to that effect. The company made no objections to this, and continued
to transport the mails for the rest of the term of four years, and received
pay therefor at the reduced rates. They then brought suit to recover
the amount of the reduction made after July 1, 1878, Held,
(1) That there was no contract to carry the mails for four years at
fixed rates;
(2) That the company might have refused to transport them at the
reduced rates;
(3) That its failure to do so and the absence of a protest constituted an
assent to the rates fixed by the reduction.
THE

case was stated thus by the court in its opinion.

The clain upon which this action is brought is for the
balance alleged to be due the appellant for carrying the mails
of the United States on certain routes, between July 1, 1878,
and June 30, 1881.
It appears -from the findings of fact that this company, for
some years prior to March 31, 1877, carried the mails on each
one of thirteen routes, under written contracts with the Postmaster General prescribing the compensation it was to receive
for such services. The last one of these contracts was made
March 31, 1874, and covered the period beginning January 1,
1874, and ending June 30, 1871. This contract was made subject to the provisions of the act of March 3, 1873, 17 Stat.
558, c. 231, Rev. Stat. ยง 4002, which authorized and directed

the Postmaster General to readjust the compensation thereafter to be paid for the transportation of mails on railroad
routes, the pay per mile per annum, not to exceed certain
rates, graduated by the average weight of the mails carried
"to be ascertained in every case by the actual weighing of the
mails for such a number of successive working days, not less
than thirty, at such times after June 30, 1873, and not less frequently than once in every four years, and the result to be
stated and verified in such form and manner as the Postmaster General may direct."
By an act approved March 3, 1815, 18 Stat. 34-1, c. 128, the
Postmaster General was directed to have the mails weighed
by the employes of the Post Office Department, and to have
the weights stated and verified to him by them, under such
instructions as he considered just to the department and to
the railroad companies. Subsequently, by an act approved
July 12, 1876, that officer was "authorized and directed to
readjust the compensation to be paid from and after July 1,
1876, for transportation of mails on railroad routes by reducing the compensation to all railroad companies for the transportation of mails ten per centum per annum from the rates
fixed and allowed" by the first section of the act of March 3,
1873. The same act provided that railroad companies, whose
railroads were constructed in whole or in part by a land-grant
made by Congress on the condition that the mails should be
transported over their road at such price as Congress should
by law direct, shall receive only eighty per centum of the
compensation authorized by the act of July 12, 1876, 19 Stat.
78, 79, c. 179, Richardson's Suppl. Rev Stat. 224.
The company was paid according to the terms of the contract of March 31, 1874, up to and including June 30, 1877.
Prior to February 1, 1877, the Postmaster General sent to
claimants, for each of the routes covered by its contract with
the United States, a "railroad-distance circular," and, prior to
April 16, 1877, a "railroad-weight circular," the object of the
first circular being to obtain accurate information for the use
of the department in regard to the length and location of the
plaintiff's road, and that of the last being to obtain a state-

ment of mail matter conveyed by it. The information called
for by these circulars having been furnished, the Postmaster
General, December 20, 1877, readjusted the compensation to
be paid for carrying the mails over the routes in question, giving due notice thereof to the sixth auditor and to the railroad
company That order was in this form "Authorize the Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department to pay the
Eastern Railroad Company, quarterly, for carrying the mail
between
and
from July 1, 1877, to June 30, 1881,
at the rate of $
per annum (being 8
per mile
per annum), unless otherwise ordered, subject to fines and
deductions." On the same day the Postmaster General sent
to the company a circular notice of adjustment of pay for
each route in this form "The compensation for the transportation of mails, etc., on your road, route
between
and
, has been fixed from July 1, 1877, to June 30,
1881, (unless otherwise ordered,) under acts of Mitarch 3, 1873,
July 12, 1876, upon returns showing the amount and character
of the service for thirty days, commencing April 16, 1877, at
the rate of
per annum, being $
per mile for
miles." The compensation thus fixed was the maximum
authorized by the act of 1873, as amended by that of 1876.
By the first section of the act of June 17, 1878, making appropriations for the fiscal year of the Post Office Department
for the year ending June 30, 1879, and for other purposes, the
Postmaster General was "authorized and directed to readjust
the compensation to be paid from and after the first day of
July, 1878, for transportation of mails on railroad routes by
reducing the compensation to all railroad compames for the
transportation of mails five per ceutum per annum from the
rates for the transportation of mails, as the basis of the average weight fixed and allowed" by the first section of the act
of July 12, 1876, 20 Stat. 140, c. 259, Richardson Suppl. Rev.
Stat. 359. On the 12th of July, 1878, that officer readjusted
the compensation to be paid to the appellant for the transportation of mails on said routes after July 1, 1878. Of this readjustment due notice was given to the company and to the
Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department. The

notice to the Auditor was in this form "Authorize the Auditor to decrease the pay of the Eastern Railroad Company for
carrying the mails between
and
from July 1, 1878,
to June 30, 1881, at the rate of
per annum, leaving the
pay from that date
per annum (being
per mile,) being
a reduction of five per centum from the rates fixed for weight
of mails in accordance with the act of June 17, 1878." The
notice to the company was in this form. "Please take notice
that the Auditor of the Treasury for this Department has been
directed to decrease the pay of your company for the conveyance of the mails on Route 9, between Portland and Portsmouth, from July 1, 1878, to June 30, 1881, $558.19 per annum,
leaving the pay from the first-named date $13,233.55 per annum, being a reduction of five per centun from the rates fixed
for weight of mails in accordance with the provision of the act
of June 17, 1878."
In 1879, the Postmaster General, upon the application of
the railroad company, caused the mails on the route between
Portland and Boston to be re-weighed.
That re-weighing
resulted in an order, August 26, 1879, considerably increasing
the compensation previously directed to be paid, but still it
was five per cent less than it would have been under the order
of December 20, 1877, unaffected by the reduction made by
the order of July 12, 1878.
For carrying the mails on all the routes in question, from
July 1, 1877, to June 30, 1881, both inclusive, the railroad
company received compensation in conformity with the above
orders of the Postmaster General, that is, from July 1, 1877,
to June 30, 1878, according to the orders and notice of December 20, 1877, and from July 1, 1878, to December 30, 1881,
according to those orders as modified July 12, 1878, and
August 26, 1879.
The difference between the amounts actually paid to the
claimant under all of said orders, and the amount it would
have received under the order of December 20, 1877-if it
was not bound by the order of July 12, 1878, making the
reduction of five per cent-is $5926.56, the amount claimed in
the petition.

Opinion of the Court.

It does not appear that the company, at any time before the
commencement of the action, made any protest against or
objection to the readjustments of its compensation made by
the Postmaster General.

1Mm. JusTlcn HIA LRA delivered the opinon of the court.
After stating the case he continued.
After the first of July, 187, the company was under no
legal obligation to carry the mails. It carried them after
that date under an implied contract that it should receive such
compensation as was reasonable, not exceeding the maximum
rates prescribed by Congress, and subject to a readjustment of
rates as required by the act of 1816. Such readjustment took
place on the 20th of December, 1817. If the order made by
the Postmaster General on that day, fixing certain rates, upon
the basis of a reduction of ten per cent, for carrying the mails,
from July 1, 18711, to June 30, 1881, and its acceptance by the
railroad company, constituted an express contract, in respect
to the compensation to be paid to it, still, as, by the terms of
both the order and the notice, those rates were to govern,
"unless otherwise ordered," there is no ground for the company to complain of the subsequent reduction of five per cent.
This reservation of power in the Postmaster General opened the
way for him to exercise the authority conferred, and to conform
to the direction given, by the act of 1878. It cannot be said
that the reduction of five per cent was a violation of that
contract, for, according to its terms, the parties agreed that
the rates fixed at the latter date were subject to such future
orders as the Postmaster General might make. We do not
mean that the railroad company was bound to continue the
carrying of the mails, if subsequent changes in the rates were

unreasonable or did not meet with its assent. On the contrary,
it was at liberty, when the five per cent reduction was made,
to discontinue their transportation on its cars.
Chief Justice Richardson, speaking for the Court of Clams,
properly said that the order for the reduction under the act of
1878, and the notice thereof to the company, "constituted an
offer on the part of the Postmaster General which the claimant might decline or accept at his pleasure." Having received
the reduced compensation without protest or objection, it may
be justly held to have accepted that offer.
It is a mistake to suppose that these views are inconsistent
with the decision in Chwago &c. Railway Co. v Unzted States,
104 U S. 680, 684:. It was there held that the act of 1876
should not be construed as affecting the rights of a railroad
company under a contract for transporting the mail which
was in all respects valid under the laws in force when it was
made, that the language of the acts of 1875 and 1876 "may
well be satisfied by confining them to cases where no time
contracts for service were then in existence, and to contracts
thereafter to be entered into," and that this did not legitimately apply to contracts then existing, whose terms had not
expired. That case differs from the present one in the important particular, that in the former the company bound itself
to carry the mails during a certain period, and, consequently
its acceptance from time to time, during that period, of less
than it was entitled to demand did not prejudice its right to
claim what was legally due under its contract, whereas, in the
present case, the company could have declined to accede to
the readjustments of rates when they were made.
We perceive no error in the judgment, and it is therefore

-Affirmed.
