DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA.
X6.152. Argued October 31, November 1, 1888.-Decided November 19, 1888.

Although'silence as to a material fact is not necessarily, as matter of law,
equivalent to a false representation, yet concealment or suppression by
either party to a contract of sale, with intent to deceive, of a material
fact which he is in good faith bound to disclose, is evidence of, and
equivalent to, a false representation.
Instructions given to a jury upon their coming into court after they have
retired to consider their verdict, and not excepted to at the time, cannot
be reviewed on error, although counsel were absent when they were
given.
Affidavits filed in support of a motion for a new trial are no part of the

GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.

The original action was brought by the Wyoming Cattle
Ranche Company, a British corporation, having its place of
business at Edinburgh in Scotland, against John T. Stewart,
a citizen of Iowa. The petition contained two counts.
The first count alleged that in July, 1882, the defendant, owning a herd of cattle in Wyoming Territory, and horses going
with that herd, and all branded with the same brand, and also
80 shorthorn bulls, and 700 head of mixed yearlings, offered
to sell the same with other personal property for the sum of
$400,000; and at the same time represented to the plaintiff and
its agent, that there had already been branded 2800 calves as

Opinion of the Court.

the increase of the herd for the current season, and that the
whole branding of calves and increase of the herd for that season would amount to 4000, and that, exclusive of the branding
for that year, the herd consisted of 15,000 head of cattle, and
that there were 150 horses running with it and branded with
the same brand; that had the representation that 2800 calves
had been branded been true, it was reasonable from that fact
to estimate that the whole brmnding for that year would be
4000 head, and that the whole herd, exclusive of the increase
for that year was 15,000 head; that the defendant, when he
made these representations, knew that they were false and
fraudulent, and made them for the purpose of de-iving the
plaintiff and its agent, and of inducing the plaintiff to purchase the herd; and that the plaintiff, relying upon the representations, and believing them to be true, purchased the herd
and paid the price. The second count alleged that the defendant had failed to
deliver the bulls and yearlings as agreed.
At the trial the following facts were proved: The defendant,
being the owner of a ranche with such a herd of cattle, gave
in writing to one Tait the option to purchase it and them at
$400,000, and wrote a letter to Tait describing all the property,
and gave him a power of attorney to sell it. He also wrote a
letter describing the property to one Majors, a partner of Tait.
A provisional agreement for the sale of the property, referring
to a prospectus signed at the same time, was made by Tait
with the plaintiff in Scotland, a -condition of which was that
a person to be appointed by the plaintiff should make a favorable report. One Clay was accordingly appointed, and went
out to Wyoming and visited the ranche; certain books and
schedules made by one Street, the superintendent of the ranehe,
were laid before him; and he and the defendant rode over the
ranche together for several days.
Clay testified that, in the course of his interviews with the
defendant, the latter made to him the false representations
alleged in the petition, and requested him to rely on these
representations, and not to make 'inquiries from the foreman
and other persons; and that, relying on the representations,

Opinion of the Court.

he made a favorable report to the plaintiff, which thereupon
completed the purchase. The plaintiff also introduced evidence
tending to prove the other allegations in the petition. The
defendant testified that he never made the representations
alleged.
The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff in the
sum of $55,000, upon which judgment was rendered, and the
defendant sued out this writ of error.
No exception was taken to the judge's instructions to the
jury upon the second count. The only exceptions contained
in the bill of exceptions allowed by the judge, and relied on
at the argument, were to the following instructions given to
the jury in answer to the plaintiff's requests:
"14. I am asked by the plaintiff to give a number of instructions, a portion of which I give, and a portion of which
I must necessarily decline to give. My attention is called to
one matter, however, and as I cannot give the instruction as
it is asked for, and as the matter it contains is, as I think,
of the first importance, I will state my own views upon that
particular point.
"I am asked to say to the jury, if they believe from the
evidence that, while Clay was making the inspection, Stewart
objected to Clay making inquiries about the number of calves
branded, of the foremen and other men, and thereby prevented
Clay from prosecuting inquiries which might have led to information that less than 2000 calves had been branded, the jury
are instructed that such acts on the part of Stewart amount
in law to misrepresentations.
"In reference to that point, I feel it my duty to say this to
the jury, that if the testimony satisfies you that after all the
documents in question that have been introduced in evidence
here went into the hands of the home company in Scotland,
where it had its office and where it usually transacted its business, if it was not satisfied with what appears in those papers,
and if it did not see proper to base its judgment and action on
the information that those papers contained, but nevertheless
sent Clay to _Wyoming to investigate the facts and circumstances connected with the transaction, to ascertain the number

Opinion of the Court.

of cattle and the number of horses and the condition of the
ranche, and the number of calves that would probably be
branded; if the company sent him there as an expert for the
purpose of determining all those things for itself and for himself, and relied upon him, and he was to go upon the ranche
himself, and exercise his own judgment, and ascertain from
that, without reference to any conversation had with Stewart,
then it would make no difference. But whilst he was in pursuit
of the information for which he went there, Stewart would
have no right to throw unreasonable obstacles in his way to
prevent his procuring the information that he sought and that
he desired. If the testimony satisfies you that when they did
go there together, and whilst Clay was making efforts to
procure the information which he did, and whilst he was in
pursuit of it, and while he was on the right track, Stewart
would have no right to throw him off the scent, so to speak,
and prevent him, in any fraudulent and improper way, from
procuring the information desired, and, if he did that, that
itself is making, or equal to. making, false and fraudulent
representations for the purpose in question. But if Stewart
did none of these things, then, of course, what is now said has
no application.
"15. In determining whether Stewart made misrepresentations about the number of cattle, or the loss upon his herd, or
the calf brand of 1882, the jury will take into consideration
the documents made by Stewart prior to and upon the sale,
namely, the power of attorney to Tait, the descriptive letter,
the optional contract, letter to Majors, schedules made by
Street, provisional agreement and prospectus, and his statements to Clay, if the jury finds he made any, upon Clay's
inspection trip; and if the jury find that in any of these statements there were any material misrepresentations on which
plaintiff relied, believing the same, which have resulted to the
damage of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for
such damage.
"16. If the jury find from the evidence that Stewart purposely kept silent when he ought to have spoken and informed
Clay of material facts, or find that by any language or acts

STEWART v. WYOMING RANCIIE CO.
Opinion of the Court.

he intentionally misled Clay about the number bf cattle in the
herd, or the number of calves branded in the spring of 1882, or
by any acts of expression or by silence consciously misled or
deceived Clay, or permitted him to be misled or deceived,
then the jury will be justified in finding that Stewart made
material misrepresentations; and must find for the plaintiff, if
the plaintiff believed and relied upon the representations made
by the defendant."
The judge, at the beginning and end of his charge, stated to
the jury the substance of the allegations in the petition as
the only grounds for a recovery in this action; and, at the
defendant's request, fully instructed them upon the general
rules of law applicable to actions of this description, and gave,
among others, the following instructions:
"5. In order to recover on the ground of false representations, such false representations must be shown to be of a then
existing matter of fact material to the transaction; and no
expression of opinion or judgment or estimation, not involving the assertion of an unconditional fact, can constitute
actionable false representation, and in such case the jury mbst
find for the defendant on the first count in the petition."
"8. In order to justify a recovery, it must be shown by
proof that the plaintiff's agent relied upon the alleged false
representations, and made them the ground and basis of his
report, but that he was so circumstanced as to justify him in
so relying upon and placing confidence in said representations;
and if it appears that he had other knowledge, or had received
other representations and statements, conflicting therewith,
sufficient to raise reasonable doubts as to the correctness of
such representations, then there can be no recovery on the
first count."
The judge, of his own motion, further instructed the jury
that they were to decide upon the comparative weight of the
conflicting testimony of Clay and of the defendant, and added,
"It seems to me that the first count must hinge upon that one
point, because, if there was no statement made by Stewart to
Clay with reference to the number of calves that were branded,
during this trip of inspection of the ranche, then it seems to

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

me that the whole theory which underlies the claim of the
plaintiff 3nust be an erroneous one."
Taking all the instructions together, we are of opinion
that they conform to the well settled law, and that there is no
ground for supposing that the jury can have been misled by
any of the instructions excepted to.
In an action of deceit, it is true that silence as to a material
fact is not necessarily, as matter of law, equivalent to a false
representation. But mere silence is quite different from concealment; aZiud est tacere, a iud celare; a suppression of the
truth may amount to a suggestion of falsehood; and if, with
intent to deceive, either party to a contract of sale conceals or
suppresses a material fact, which he is in good faith bound to
disclose, this is evidence of and equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression is in effect a representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth. The gist
of the action is fraudulently producing a false impression upon
the mind of the other party; and if this result is accomplished,
it is unimportant whether the means of accomplishing it are
words or acts of the defendant, or his concealment or suppression of material facts not equally within the knowledge or
reach of the plaintiff.
The case of Laoidlaw v. Organ, 2 Wheat. 178, is much in
point. In an action by the buyer of tobacco against the sellers to recover possession of it, there was evidence that before
the sale the buyer, upon being asked by Girault, one of the
sellers, whether there was any news which was calculated to
enhance its price or value, was silent, although he had received
news, which the seller had not, of the Treaty of Ghent. The
court below, "there being no evidence that the plaintiff had
asserted or suggested anything to the said Girault, calculated
to impose upon him with respect to the said news, and to induce him to think or believe that it did not exist," directed a
verdict for the plaintiff. Upon a bill of exceptions to that
direction, this court, in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice
Marshall, held that while it could not be laid down, as a matter of law, that the intelligence of extrinsic circumstances
which might influence the price of the commodity, and which

STEWART 'v. WYOMING RANCHE CO.
Opinion of the Court.

was exclusively within the knowledge of the vendee, ought to
have been conimunicated by him to the vendor, yet, at the
same time, each party must take care not to say or do anything tending to impose upon the other, and that the absolute
instruction of the judge was erroneous, and the question
whether any imposition was practised by the vendee upon the
vendor ought to have been submitted to the jury.
The instructions excepted to in the case at bar clearly
affirmed the same rule. The words and conduct relied on as
amounting to false representations were those of the seller of
a large herd of cattle ranging over an extensive territory, and
related to the number of the herd itself, of which he had full
knowledge, or means of information, not readily accessible to
a purchaser coming from abroad; and the plaintiff introduced
evidence tending to show that the defendant, while going
over the ranche with the plaintiff's agent, made positive false
representations as to the number of calves branded during the
year, and also fraudulently prevented him from procuring other
information as to the number of calves and consequently as
to the number of cattle on the ranche.
In giving the fourteenth instruction, the judge expressly
declined to say, that if the defendant prevented the plaintiff's
agent from prosecuting inquiries which might have led to information that less than 2000 calves had been branded, such
acts of the defendant would amount in law to misrepresentations; but on the contrary submitted to the jury the question
whether the defendant fraudulently and improperly prevented
the plaintiff's agent from procuring the information demanded;
and only instructed them that if he did, that was making, or
equal to making, false and fraudulent representations for the
purpose in question.
So the clear meaning of the sixteenth instruction is, that
the jury were not authorized to find material misrepresentations by the defendant, unless he purposely kept silent as to
material facts which it was his duty to disclose, or by language or acts pumposely misled the plaintiff's agent about the
number of cattle in the herd or the number of calves branded,
or, by words or silence, knowingly misled or deceived him, or

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

knowingly permitted him to be misled or deceived, in regard
to such material facts, and in one of these ways purposely
produced a false impression upon his mind.
The defendant objects to the fifteenth instruction, that the
judge submitted to the jury the question whether the defendant
made misrepresentations about the number of cattle, and about
the loss upon the herd, as well as about the calf brand of 1882.
It is true that the principal matter upon which the testimony
was conflicting was whether the defendant did make the representation that 2800 calves had been branded in that year.
But the chief importance of that misrepresentation, if made,
was that it went to show that the herd of cattle which produced the calves was less numerous than the defendant had represented; and the petition alleged that the defendant made
false and fraudulent representations, both as to the number of
calves branded and as to the number of the whole herd. So
evidence of the loss of cattle by death, beyond what had been
represented by the defendant, tended to show that the herd was
less in number than he represented.
The remaining objection argued. is to an instruction given by
the judge to the jury in response to a question asked by them
upon coming into court after they had retired to consider their
verdict. It is a conclusive answer to this objection, that no
exception was taken to this instruction at the time it was
given, or before the verdict was returned. The fact that
neither of the counsel was then present affords no excuse.
Affidavits filed in support of a motion for a new trial are no
part of the record on error, unless made so by bill of exceptions. The absence of counsel, while the court is in session, at
any time between the impanelling of the jury and the return
of the verdict, cannot limit the power and duty of the judge to
instruct the jury in open court on the law of the case as occasion may require, nor dispense with the necessity of seasonably
excepting to his rulings and instructions, nor give jurisdiction
to a court of error to decide questions not appearing of record.
Judgment affirmed.
