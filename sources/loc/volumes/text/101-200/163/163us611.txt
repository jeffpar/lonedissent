UNION PACIFIC R'Y CO. v. CHICAGO &c. R'Y CO.

611

Names of Counsel.

permitting property or money, parted with on the faith of
the unlawful contract, to be recovered back or compensation
to be made for it. In such case, however, the action is not
maintained upon the unlawful contract, nor according to its
terms, but on an implied contract of the defendant to return,
or, failing to do that, to make compensation for, money or
property which it has no right to retain. To maintain such an
action is not to affirm, but to disaffirm, the unlawful contract."
I think that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
should be reversed and the cause remanded to the Circuit
Court with directions to set aside its decree and dismiss the
bill.
MR.JUsTICE GRAY likewise dissented.
