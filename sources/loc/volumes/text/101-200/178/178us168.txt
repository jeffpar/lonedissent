OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Statement of the Case.

OASTNER v. COFFMAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 113. Argued January 23, 24, 1900.-Decided May 21, 1900.

On the facts as detailed in the opinion of the court, it is held that there
was no error in the decree of the court below.

THIs suit was commenced on March 12, 1897, in the United
States Circuit Court for the District of West Virginia, sitting
in equity. On the date mentioned a bill of complaint was filed
on behalf of Samuel Castner, junior, and Henry B. Curran, copartners, trading under the firm name of Castner & Curran.
The defendant named in the bill was W. H. Coffman, doing
business under the name of Pocahontas Coke and Coal Company
and W. H. Coffman Coke Company. The relief prayed was
substantially that the defendant might be perpetually restrained
from using or imitating the name Pocahontas in connection
with the selling, advertising or offering for sale, of coal. The
relief thus asked for was based upon the averment that the word
Pocahontas was a trademark for coal, which trademark was
owned by the complainant firm, and besides that the word in
question had come in the course of business to designate the
coal offered for sale by the complainants, and that the use of
the name by the defendant was calculated to deceive tle public
into believing that the coal dealt in by him was coal which had
been inspected and graded by the complainants, and would thus
operate to defraud the complainant, and constituted undue and
unlawful competition in trade.
Affidavits and exhibits were filed with the bill in support of
a motion for an injunction. A demurrer to the bill having been
overruled, the defendant filed an answer, accompanied by affidavits and exhibits in opposition to the motion for an injunction.
Several affidavits in rebuttal were thereupon filed on behalf of
the complainants. Upon the record thus made the motion for

CASTNER v. COFFMAN.
Statement of the Case.

an injunction was heard, and, after consideration by the court,
it was decreed as follows:
"That the defendant in his own name, and in the name of
the Pocahontas Coke and Coal Company, and in the name of
the W. H. Coffman Coke Company, and his servants, attorneys,
associates, confederates, agents and workmen, and each and
every of them, be and the same are restrained and inhibited
from using the name ' Pocahontas ' or ' Pocahontas Flat Top '.
in connection with his business, the court being of the opinion
that the complainants have a right to use the said word I Pocahontas' for the purpose of indicating that the coal was from
the Pocahontas field, and that the complainants have the sole
right to use said word as indicating the character of coal they
sell. But this injunction is not to restrain or inhibit the defendant or his agents from advertising, offering for sale or selling
coal from what is known in Virginia, or West Virginia, as the
Pocahontas coal field, or advertising the coal as so mined and
produced from that field, and this injunction shall not apply to
transactions of the defendant already concluded by actual shipments of coal."
The defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit. Among the assignments of error filed was
the following:
"II. The court erred in rendering any decree at all until the
merits of the said cause, as put in issue by the pleadings, were
fully developed by proofs adduced in the proper order of chancery proceeding and practice."
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the Circuit Court and remanded the cause, with directions to dismiss
the bill. It was held that the complainants had no trademark
in the word Pocahontas; thatr they were not entitled to the exclusive use of that word to designate the coal sold by them, or its
character or quality, but, on the contrary, that the word Pocahontas indicated coal mined in the Pocahontas coal field, and
that all the producers of that region had the right to use it in
common with the complainants. The court held that the proof
did not show that the defendant had practiced any deception on
the public or that he had perpetrated any fraud upon the ap-

pellees. Before the mandate issued, however, a rehearing was
applied for, and the reviewing court was asked to provide in
the mandate, after reversing the order granting a preliminary
injunction, that the parties should "proceed to take their proofs
in order that the cause may thereafter be heard upon pleadings
and proofs, to the end that a final decree may be entered." This
petition for a rehearing was denied, the court stating:
"We are clearly of the opinion, not only that complainants
below are not entitled to an injunction, but also that there is
no equity in- their bill, and that, therefore, it will be a useless
expenditure of time and money, and cause fruitless delay, to
take the -evidence mentioned in the petition for a rehearing."
The cause was then brought to this court by writ of certiorari.

Mr. E. B. Stocking for Coffman.
MR. JusTicE Warm, after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
The complainants in their bill predicate their asserted right
to the sole and exclusive use of the name Pocahontas, as applying to coal, upon tw6 grounds: First, the ownership of the alleged trademark, which it is averred the complainants acquired
from the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company in April,
1895; and, second, upon a use by the complainants and their
predecessors in right of the word Pocahontas as a tradeinark or
name to designate the character and the quality of the coal dealt
in by them. In other words, the complainants contend that for
many years prior to the period when they assert they were vested
by the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company with the
ownership of the alleged trademark they, as licensees of said
company, used the word Pocahontas to designate the coal sold
by them, to such an extent that that word, as applied to coal,
came to represent in the public mind the coal of the complainants; that this continued up to the time -the trademark was
acquired, and from that time down to the filing of the bill.

CASTNER v. COFFMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

Whilst the propositions above stated portray the rights asserted by the complainants in their bill, in their proof and in
the argument at bar, a wider contention is advanced-that is,
that the complainants have a right to the name Pocahontas,
not only because they acquired it whilst acting under a license
from the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company and as
the assignees of a trademark owned by that company, but that
they have a right to the name Pocahontas independently of the
existence of any such right in the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, or of the ownership by that company of a trademark embracing that name. Without stopping to consider the
conflict which is engendered by this latter view, we shall 'at
once proceed to an analysis of the evidence in the record, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether the complainants have the
exclusive right, claimed by them, derived either as licensees or
assignees of the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, dr
in any other way.
The coal which was the subject of the dealings had by the
complainants as averred in their bill, was the product of what
is known as the Great Flat Top coal region of Virginia and
West Virginia. It is referred to in the bill of complaint as "a
tract or field of smokeless bituminous or semibituminous coal."
The initial operations in the development of the region were
begun in 1881 by a Virginia corporation styled the Southwest
Virginia Improvement Company. Some surface work was
done in the fall of that year. In March,'1882, the first blast
was put in what was termed the east mine; a contract was
closed to run that mine one mile; also the air course and the
No. 1 west mine. These mines were situated respectively east
and west of a stream called Coal Branch. As early as March,
1882, a .contract was made to supply coal from these mines to
the Norfolk and Western Railway Company. The branch of
that road to the mines, however, was not completed until March,
1883, and the first shipment of coal was made in that'month.
As a result of the operations referred to a mining town was
located near to the mines, and was called Pocahontas. It was
made a post office in 1882. It had a population in January,.
1883, of one thousand souls, and was incorporated by the legis-

Opinion of the Court.

lature of Virginia in 1884: under the name of Pocahontas. The
Improvement Company also named its mines the Pocahontas
mines, and from the beginning appears to have sold the product
of its mines as Pocahontas coal.
Without minutely tracing the development of the coal field
in question, it may suffice to say that either by acquiring coal
lands from the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, or
from other sources, a laud company, known as the Flat Top
Association, became interested in lands within the coal field in
question, and by 1885 several mines additional to those owned
by the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company were being
worked by other operators. The.connection of the complainants or their predecessors with the mines or coal field in question arose as follows:
While it is alleged in the bill that "some time prior to January, 1884," Castner & Company, Limited, a corporation, "dealt
in, inspected and sold coal from such region or field aforesaid,"
there is no proof in the record even tending to show that Castner & Company had any connection with Pocahontas coal prior
to January 1, 1885. Indeed, as it will hereafter develop, the
fact that they did not represent that article is clearly inferable
from a statement madeby them in an application for the registry of an alleged trademark.
It is established that in July, 1883, one William Lamb was
the agent of the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company,
at Norfolk, Virginia, and that the general sales agent of the
company was one Edward S. Hutchinson, who was located in
Philadelphia, at which place the general offices of the company
were established. Castner & Company, Limited, became the
general tidewater coal agent on January 1, 1885, for the pr6duct
of all the mines then in operation in the Great Flat Top coal
region, including the product of the original Pocahontas mines.
This appointment was the outgrowth of an agreement entered
into between the Norfolk and Western Railroad, the Southwest
Virginia Improvement Company, the Flat Top Coal Company
and three lessees of the latter company operating coal mines in
the region referred to. This agreement was made on the 29th
of December, 1884. It provided for the handling of the entire

CASTNER v. COFFMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

coal output of all the then producers, and of any subsequent
operators in said region, by a general coal agent, to be appointed
by the railroad company. The contract, .moreover, provided
for the appointment by the railroad company of another person, to be known as the general tidewater coal agent, and who
was to be subject to the general direction and management of
the general coal agent. It was also stipulated in the contract
that the general coal agent should perform outstanding contracts of the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company for
the delivery of coal. Castner & Company, Limited, were appointed the general tidewater coal agent under the agreement.
In passing, it is proper to notice the fact that the coal mined
in the various collieries in operation at the date of this agreement, as is the case with the mines now being operated, was
from the same seam as that mined at the original Pocahontas
mines, which seam was then known as the "Nelson or Pocahontas bed, No. 3." It clearly appears from the record that
prior to the date of the contract above mentioned, at a time
when the predecessors of the complainants appear to have had
nothing to do with the product at the Pocahontas mines, the
coal mined from the Pocahontas vein had become well and favorably known as a coal of high grade. Thus, in a letter from
sales agent Hutchinson, dated July 5, 1883, he states: "We are
all especially pleased with the testimonial from Mr. -McCarrick,
and it confirms the view we have all along entertained, that the
Pocahontas coal is the best steam coal in the market?' So, also,
in. the eighth article of the contract between Castrier & Company, Limited, and the railroad company, by which the former
was appointed the general tidewater coal agent, itX was recited
that, "The coal from the Great Flat Top coal region has proved
to be of superior quality, and suitable for steam purposes, and
especially for the use of ocean steamships, as well as for sale in
the West Indian and South American markets.'" That the coal
supplidd by the producers might, however, in some instances, be
of inferior quality was recognized in a stipulation contained in
the coal producers' contract, providing for an allowance to be
made to purchasers of coal because of inferiority of quality,
such allowance to be deducted from any amount found due or
that might become due to the producer.

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

While the contract between the coal producers and the agreement appointing the general tidewater coal agent are contained
in the record, the agreement appointing the general coal agent
•was not put in evidence. One of the complainants, in an affidavit dated March 18, 1897, attached as an exhibit a monthly
statement rendered by the coal agent, which is headed "Office
of'the General Coal Agent, Roanoke, Virginia, February 15,
1885." Nowhere in the statement however, is there an intimation as to who was such coal agent. It is plainly inferable,
however, from the excerpt which we now make, who was the
appointee to that responsible position. The extract we make
is from the issue of October, 1891, of a publication styled, "The
Iron Belt." It reads as follows:
"POCAHONTAS COMPANY.

"The Pocahontas Coal Company, organized January 1, 1895
(1885?). Officers: William C. Bullitt, president; D. H. Matson, secretary and treasurer; H. N. Claxton, general agent;
John Twohy, superintendent piers, Norfolk; general office,
Roanoke, Va.; branch office, Norfolk, Va.; shipping office,
Bluefield, W. Va. This company, who makes all sales for the
entire output of the .region, assuming all liabilities, shipped
during the year 1890, 1,807,716 to-is, and has shipped during
the present year to date (October 10th), 1,628,927 tons. 'From
present indications,' says Mr. Matson, secretary of the company,
we estimate that for the year 1891 we will ship 2,300,000 tons.'
"The Pocahontas Coal Company makes a uniform price for
all coal mined, furnishes inspectors for each tipple where the
coal is loaded, thus guaranteeing to purchasers coal free from
bone, slate and other impurities. This company pays the operators by check the fifteenth day of each month, thus securing
them against losses by reason of bad debts, storage and freight
rates. The company employs twenty-six sub-inspectors, who
are under the supervision of Mr. W. D. Milne, chief inspector.
Mr. Milne's headquarters are at Bramwell, and he makes a tour
of inspection of each tipple at least once a week."
So, also, there is contained in the record a letter, headed with
the names of the then officers of what is termed "Pocahontas

Opinion of the Court.

Coal Company, shippers.of celebrated Pocaliontas coal." On
this letter head was a vignette, presumably the figure of Pocahontas. This letter was addressed to the proprietors of the
Indian Ridge Colliery, and referred to the handling, by the
Pocahontas Coal Company of the product of that colliery. The
Indian Ridge Colliery, referred to in this letter, is one of the
mines represented by the defendant in this cause. The operation of this mine was commenced about the date of the letter,
and its product, in accordance with the general agreement already stated, was shipped- through the general coal agent, the
Pocahontas Coal Company.
In the article in The Iron Belt, above referred to, there is
also a statement of the production from 1883 to 1891 of the
various mines controlled in October, 1891, by the Pocahontas
Company, as the general coal agent of all the mine owners or
operators. This statement showed that from one colliery operating in 1883 the number of collieries had increased to nineteen
in October, 1891.
Under the coal producers' agreement, as we have s~en, the
entire product of the mines in the Great Flat Top coal- region,
intended -forrail transportation other than-that used for coke,
was to be consigned to the general coal agenit, and only a portion.of such product was to be handled by the general tidewater coal agent, whose operations were t6.be "subject to the
exclusive control, supervision and direction of the general coal
agent."
We have already referred to the fact that when the combi-nation referred to was formed the coal mined from the Pocahontas, or No. 3 .bed, bad, under that name, an established
reputation. Further confirmatory evidence of this -fact will
now be. referrd to. Andrew S. McCreath, chemist to the
state geological survey, of Pennsylvania, embodied the results
of much research and personal investigation during part of
1882, and the fall of 1883, and the7 spring of" 1884-, in a work
entitled "Mineral Wealth of Virginia,' extracts from which
are contained, in the record. At page 110 he. mentions the existence of- numerous openhigs on the "Nelson or Pocahontas
coal bed (No. 3 of the section,)" and also of some few openings

Opinion of the Court.

on the upper'beds, No. 5 and No. 6. He further says (p. 110):
"On Coal Branch, the Pocahontas bed (No. 3) has been extensively mined at the Pocahontas mines of the Southwest
Virginia Improvement Company."
At page 150 he says:
"The section at Pocahontas shows the presence of at least
three workable beds above water ]evel, although almost the
entire output of the region at present comes from the No. 3
Nelson or Pocahontas bed.
"This handsome coal bed is everywhere present, so far as
explored, with a workable thickness, being 11' 3" in the vicinity
of Pocahontas, and holding its workable dimensions through
the field for five miles eastward to the waters of Flipping Creek,
where it becomes split into two beds, about 4. and 5j feet
thick.
"To the west of Pocahontas, along Laurel Creek, for a distance of eight miles, the bed carries its full thickness fairly
well, and shows nearly the same section for a long distance
north of the dividing ridge on the waters of the Elkhorn and
the Tug Fork of Sandy.
"The good quality bf this coal has been well established by
numerous tests, both in the laboratory and in actual practice."
The Pocahontas Coal Company appears to have continued to
act as general coal agent of the producers' combination until
the spring of 1895, about the time of the appointment of a receiver for the Norfolk and Western Railroad, which company,
as will be remembered, was a party to the original agreement
of the combination. By this time the development of the coal
field in question had largely progressed, and a number of additional mines were being operated. A new company, called
the Pocahontas Company, was chartered on March 12, 1895,
and in 1896 this company was handling the coal produced from
numerous mines in the Pocahontas field. Agreements were
made, however, by the complainants in March, 1895, directly
with some of the mine owners formerly represented by the
Pocahontas Coal Company, (among them the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company,) .bywhich agreements complain-

ants were constituted the general factors and selling agent&for
the product of the mines of such owners.
The product of the Indian Ridge mine, now represented, as
we have said, by the defendant, and which was opened in.the
spring of 1894, when it ceased to be shipped through the Pocahontas Coal Company, as general agent, was marketed through
the agency of the complainants until January 1, 1896. From
this last mentioned date until NIovember. 1, 1896, the product
of the mine was shipped through the Pocahontas Company, the
complainants having become the sole agents of the latter company for tidewater and line trade.
It is plainly inferable from the avermentg of the bill, as it is
unquestionably eatablished bi the evidence in the record, that
from January 1 1885, the date of the coal producers' combination referred to, the product of the various collieries controlled
by the combination "was uniformly termed Pocahontas coal, and
the evidence shows. that this appellation was made use of as
well upon bill heads and -advertising matter of the general coal
agent, and of some, at least, of the producers, as upon the stationery and advertising matter of Castner & Company, Limited,
the general tidewater coal agent.
It is by the light of the facts just stated that we come to consider the claim made in the bill -that the complainants are the
exclusive owners of- the trademark or the trade name Pocahontas, as applied to all coal coming from the Pocahontas-coal
field, because prior to April 1, 1895, they had used the same by
the license and permission of the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, and subsequent to that date had used it as
owner under an assignment of said trademark or trade name to
them from the Improvement Company. There is no evidence
whatever in the record tending to show any express license to
complainants or their predecessors froin the Southwest Virginia
Improvement Company, authorizing them to use the name Pocahontas as an exclusive trade name or trademarkfor coal; and
the facts which we have above stated render it absolutely impossible that there shiould have been any such valid license. It
is patent that the word. Pocahontas, .prior "tothe formation of
the coal producers' combination on January 1, 1885,;indicated

Opinion of the Court.

all the coal coming from a particular seam of coal known as
the Pocahontas vein. When the combination was entered into,
creating a general coal agent to dispose of all the coal to be
marketed from all the collieries which were then being worked
or might thereafter be worked in the Pocahontas region, it is
undoubted that the name Pocahontas was applied by everybody
concerned, including the Southwest Virginia Company, as indicating coal coming from the region, without reference to the
particular mine from which it was taken, for all the coal was
advertised by the owners and general coal agent under the name
of Pocahontas coal, and was contracted for and shipped under
the same name. Indeed, during the existence of the original
combination the complainants, or their predecessors, who now
assert that they have an exclusive right to the name Pocahontas
as designating the coal sold by them, were acting as tidewater
agents under the supervision and control of the general coal
agent, for all the mine owners, and were themselves selling the
coal under the name referred to as agents of the owners, and
dealing in such coal, on behalf of the owners of all the mines,
as Pocahontas coal. When the Pocahontas Coal Company
ceased to act as the general coal agent, on the appointment of
a receiver of the Norfblk and Western Railroad, the complainants, who now assert the exclusive right in themselves to the
name Pocahontas, became the principal agent for the sale of
the coal from some of the mines, among the number one of the
mines controlled by the defendaut, putting the product of that
mine upon the market, as agent of the owner, as Pocahontas
coal.
Destructive as is this state of the proof of the assertion that
there was a license to the complainants prior to 1895 by the
Southwest Virginia Improvement Cbmpany, the existence of
such a license is further rebutted by the fact that there is no
evidence of any want of knowledge by the Southwest Virginia
Improvement Company of the use by the Pocahontas Coal Company or by the producers generally of the designation Pocahontas as the name of the coal mined in any and all of the collieries
in operation in the region. Indeed, the exaggerated character
of the assertion of the complainants, that prior to 1895 they

CASTNER r. COF-FMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

used the trademark as the licensees of the Improvement Company, is shown by the record. In August, 1885, Castner &
Company, Limited, was under' the contract the general tidewater coal agent, that is, such agent for all the mine owners in
the Pocahontas region. Although thus representing the owners,
this corporation, on the 25th of August, 1885, filed an application for the registry of a trademark, in which it was recited
that Castner & Company, Limited, had adopted for its use as a
trademark for coal the word "Pocahontas," and that the same
had been continuously used by said corporation "since about
January 1, 1885." This date, it will be remembered, was when
tfie corporation referred to became the general tidewater coal
agent for the producers of Pocahontas coal. In an affidavit
deposing to the truth of the statements contained in the application, it was stated:
"That said corporation (Castner & Co., Limited,) has a right
to the use of the trademark therein described; that no other
person, firm or corporation, has the right to such use, either in
the identical form or in any such near resemblance thereto as
might be calculated to deceive."
The conflict between the claim of license made in the bill
and these sworn assertions in the application to register a trademark requires no comment. The record, however, shows a further contradiction. Turning to Exhibit B, attachedto the bill,
which is the alleged assignment of trademark made in 1895 by
the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company to Castner &
Company, Limited, and under which complainants claim to be
the owners of the trademark Pocahontas, as applied to all
coal, we find it recites that Castner & Company, Limited, had
been appointed on March 26, 1895, the agents to sell all the
output of coal of the mines of the Improvement Company,
which coal "has become known under the trade name, or mark,
IPocahontas,' by adoption and continuous use thereof by the
said corporation, the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company." Besides this, the document states that the assignor,
the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, "did adopt,
on or about the first day of July, 1882, as a trade name, or
mark, the word I Pocahontas' for coal mined in a region oy

field opened up and operated in Tazewell County, Virginia, in
the year 1882, by the said corporation, the Southwest Virginia
Improvement Company, and which trade name, or mark, it continued to use thereafter in its coal mining operations in said
region, or field, from the date aforesaid, as the trade. name, or
mark, for all coal mined and sold by it up to the present time."
Thus we, have Castner & Company, Limited, becoming by
contract an agent of the mine owners to sell their coal, putting
it upon the market as Pocahontas, coal, and dealing with it as
such, yet filing a claim for a trademark by which it was sought
to deprive the owners of the designation which appropriately
belonged to their product. We find the bill verified by both
complainants, one of whom made oath to the application for a
trademark. In such bill it is asserted that at the time the
trademark was applied for Castner & Company, Limited, were
not the owners of the trademark, but were mere licensees of
the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company.
And also it appears that, when in 1895 the complainants became the principal agents of certain of the mine owners, a
monopoly of the name of Pocahontas as against all the mine
owners was again sought to be obtained by taking a transfer
of an alleged trademark or name from the Southwest Virginia
Improvement Company, the statements in the paper reciting
such transfer being in irreconcilable conflict with the affidavit
to the application for a trademark.
But putting out of mind these contradictions, it is manifest
that, long prior to the purported assignment by the Southwest
Virginia Improvement Company of the alleged trademark or
trade name, by the acts of all the parties concerned in the production and marketing of the coal, (including the Southwest
Virginia Improvement Company, Castner & Company, Limited, and the complainants,) the name Pocahontas indicated
the region from which the coal in question came and the natural quality thereof, and applied indiscriminately to the product
of all the mines in that region, producing that character of coal.
Although the facts which we have referred to make inevitable the foregoing deductions, nevertheless we state a few additional facts which make the situation if possible yet clearer.

CASTNER v. COFFMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

In the issue of October, 1891, of The Iron Belt, already referred to, the region in question was termed the Pocahontas
Flat Top coal region, and the product thereof was frequently
referred to as Pocahontas coal or Pocahontas Flat Top coal.
So, algo, in the agreements made by complainants in March,
1895, (after the producers' combination had ceased:to be operative,) to act as sales agent for the product of certain of the
mines, there is contained express recognition of the fact that
the products of all the mines in that region, whether those
products were inspected and controlled by the coinplainants
or not, were usually designated and generally known as Pocahontas coal. Thus, in a stipulation numbered 3 in an agreement made by complainants with the Pulaski Iron Company
on March 26, 1895, it is recited:
"It is agreed by the parties hereto that the parties of the
second part may act as selling agents for other producers of
Pocahontas coal, provided they shall become and continue to
be the exclusive agents of such .producers, and provided further that the aggregate amount of coal sold -darihg any year
for the party of the first part shall be less than 2.615 per cent
of the total amount of Pocahontas coal sold by the parties of
the second part during that year."
And in a supplementary agreement with the same company,
dated December 28, 1895, it is said:
"That, until the expiration of the said contract of 26th March,
1895, according to the terms thereof, the party of the first part
will sell or dispose of no Pocahontas coal whatever save through
the agency of the parties of the second part.
"The parties of the second part hereby promise and agree
that in the event of the sale or disposition of any Pocahontas
coal by any producer for whom they may at any time be acting
as sales agent, except through the agency of the said parties of
the second part, that they will at once, on receipt of written
notice of the particulars of such sale or disposition from the
party of the first part, and upon its written request, forthwith
terminate its agency for such producer," etc.
Again, in a supplement to The Daily Telegraph; a publication

Opinion of the Court.

at Bluefield, West Virginia, such supplement being entitled
"Pocahontas Flat Top Coal Field Industrial Edition," the product of the-region referred to is frequently spoken of as Pocahontas coal or Pocahontas coke, etc. And, as bearing upon the
claim made in the bill, that the coal from this field had acquired
a great reputation in the markets of the world by reason of the
expenditures of time and money made by complainants "in
inspecting, selecting, grading and otherwise maintaining the
superior quality and purity of the said coal," we call attention
to a lengthy advertisement of the complainants contained in the
publication just referred to, in which appeared no allusion to
an inspection of the product, but wherein it was clearly recognized that the wide reputation of Pocahontas coal was the result
of making known the inherent excellent quality of the article
itself. The product of the mines represented by the complainants, among which mines was the Indian Ridge mine, now represented by the defendant, is frequently referred to in the card

testing the speed of Government cruisers built on the Atlantic seaboard,
the Secretary of the Navy having issued an order to this effect several years
ago. The Cunard and White Star Steamship Companies use it exclusively
.on their Eastern voyages, and with it have made all their great speed records of recent years. It is conceded to be the Best Fuel for Locomotives
and Stationary Engines, and its supremacy as a Steam Fuel is now established beyond dispute.

CASTNER v. COFFMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

Now, this advertisement of the complainants makes it clear
that they were offering for sale, not the particular product of
any one mine, but that the Pocahontas coal which they advertised was derived from numerous collieries within the Pocahontas region. Indeed, when it is considered that coal from the
Indian Ridge mine, which the defendant now represents, was
for a time represented by the complainants, and the coal therefrom sold by them as Pocahontas coal, the contention now'
advanced amounts but to this, that an agent can deprive the
principal of his property by appropriating it to himself, and that
complainants, because they were entrusted, first, in a subordinate capacit:r as tidewater agents by many of the mine owners
and then in a more enlarged capacity as general agent, with
power to represent and act for the producers, have come into
the position where they can virtually exercise a monopoly of sale
as to the product of all the mines in the Pocahontas region by
compelling every mine owner in the Pocahontas field to offer
no coal on the market unless the description be qualified or unless the coal be confided for sale to the complainants.
It is insisted, however, that the appellate court should have
complied with the request contained in the petition for a rehearing, and remanded the cause to permit further proofs in
support of the material allegations of the bill. In .2fast,Foos
& Co. v. ,Stover .anufacturing Co., 177 U. S. 495, we considered the question as to the power of a Circuit Court of Appeals,
in reviewing the action of a Circuit Court in allowing a temporary injunction pendente lite, upon affidavits, to consider the
case upon the merits and direct a final decree dismissing the
bill. It was held that the propriety of the exercise of such a
power must be determined from the circumstances of the particular case. And it was added:
"In 1895 there were thirty-eight collieries in operation, whose output (including tonnage converted into coke) aggregated 3,500,000 tons.
"Not only is this coal famous for the immense growth of its tonnage, but
its reputation has also increased, until to-day it enjoys the distinction of'
having been officially indorsed as the best American steam coal by the United
States NYavy Department, the United States War Department, the British
Minister at Washington, all the leading steamship, railroadand manufacturing companies," etc.

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

"If the showing made by the plaintiff be incomplete; if the
order for the injunction be reversed, because injunction was not
the proper remedy, or because under the particular circumstances of the case it should not have been granted; or if other
relief be p6ssible, notwithstanding the injunction be refused,
then, clearly, the case should be remanded for a full hearing
upon pleadings and proofs. But ifthe bill be obviously devoid
of eguity upon itsface, and such invalidity be incapableof remedy by amendment; or if the patent manifestly fail to disclose
a patentable novelty in the invention, we know of no reason
why, to save a protracted litigation, the court may not order
the bill to be dismissed."
As respects the case at bar, .we are satisfied from the. averments of the bill and the proof that no supplementary evidence
could be offered which would alter the indubitable conclusion
that no exclusive right to the trademark or trade name Pocahontas exists in the complainants. Further, we concur in the
conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the bill, upon
its face, is devoid of equity. It is fairly to be inferred from
the averments of the bill that it charges that while acting as
agents of the owner of one of the mines represented by the defendant, and of the owners of many other mines in the same
region or field, there was applied by the complainants to the
product of all the mines the appropriate designation Pocahontas
coal, a description which applied to all the coal produced by
the operators in that region, and which was correctly descrip.tive of such product. Whether, as claimed, the reputation of
the coal was enhanced by careful inspection and grading by
the complainants or their predecessors, is left conjectural by
the record. But if it be conceded that the proof on this branch
of the case was certain, it could operate no change of result.
In inspecting and grading the coal, complainants and their predecessors were but agents of the mine owners. Certainly, the
agent cannot be heard to say that he may appropriate to himself the name belonging to the product of his prinbipal, or that
he may affix the name to coal for his own purposes, and not
for the benefit and advantage of his principal.
Keeping in mind the circumstances under which the corn-

plainants made whatever use they did make of the appellation
"Pocahontas," as applied to coal produced from the Pocahontas coal region, we can perceive no just ground for the claim
that there was unfair competition in trade, by reason of the
acts averred to have been committed by the defendant. In
substance, the alleged wrongful acts were averred to consist in
the advertising in various forms by the defendant of the coal
handled by him, as "Pocahontas" coal, when in fact such coal
is a "very inferior and very impure coal." Itwas alsd averred,
in the alternative,that such acts were done with th6 intent to
cause the purchasers of said coal to believe "that the same was
sold by your orators, or is of the quality of that sold by your
orators." The effect of the advertising of the coal handled by
the defendant, as "Pocahontas" coal, it is also asserted, is that
purchasers of the coal dealt in by the defendant aie liable to
and will be deceived by such representations into purchasing
such coal "as your orators' superior and specially selected coal."
It is further averred that purchasers have in fact been so deceived, and that the "reputation of your orators' 'Pocahontas'
coal has thereby been tainted." Leaving out of view the emphatic denial of the defendant, that the coal handled by him is
in anywise inferior to that handled by the defendant, it is plain
from the averments in the bill that the allpged inferiority in
the coal is grounded upon the supposition of a want of careful
inspection and grading. We do not think, however, that if it
were a fact that it had become generally known and recognized
by the public that the complainants, while in the employ of
the coal producers of the Pocahontas coal field, inspected and
graded the product of the mines in such manner as that thereby
the reputation of the coal was enhanced, that the owners of
mines producing Pocahontas coal thereby lost their right to
designate their coal by its appropriate name, because of the
possibility that some person, by reason of the coal being termed
what it really was, might be induced to believe that it was still
inspected by complainants.
As we have already said, in its final analysis, the right which
the complainants assert amounts but to the contention that because at one time they were the agents of the owners of coal

mined from the Pocahontas field, and had sold the same as
agents for the owners under its correct name, they thereby divested the owners of their property, and have acquired a monopoly of selling all the coal from the Pocahontas field under its
appropriate name. We thin-there was no error in the decree
of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is therefore
Afflrmed.

CLARKE v. CLARKE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

No. 216. Argued April 9, 10, 1900.-Decided

May 21,1900.

It is a doctrine firmly established that the law of a State in which land is
situated controls and governs its transmission by will or its passage in
case of intestacy.
The courts of a State where real estate is situated have the exclusive right
to appoint a guardian, of a non-resident minor, and vest in such guardian
the exclusive control and management of land belonging to said minor,
situated within the State.

Tnis writ of error was procured for the purpose of obtaining
the reversal of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Errors of
the State of Connecticut, which, as respected real estate situated in the State of Connecticut, refused to follow and apply
a judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina interpreting and construing the will of Julia H. Clarke.
The facts from which the legal questions presented arise are
as follows:
Henry P. Clarke and Julia Hurd intermarried in New York
in 1886, and immediately thereafter went to South Carolina,
where they afterwards continuously resided. Mrs. Clarke died
on February 10, 1894, owning real and personal property in
South Carolina, and also real estate situated in Connecticut.
Two daughters survived, one, Nancy B., aged five years, the
other, Julia, aged about two months.
