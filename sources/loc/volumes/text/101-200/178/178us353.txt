CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE & ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY v. CLARK.
CERTIORARI TO THE oCIoUrr COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.

No. 256. Argued April 20, 23, 1900.-Decided May 28,1900.
The record shows that the cause came on for trial without a jury, a trial
by jury having been expressly waived by written consent of the parties,
that a referee was duly appointed by similar consent, in accordance with
the rules and customs of the District in which the trial-was had, and that
his findings, rulings and decisions were -made those of the court. Heldthat the question whether the judgment rendered was warranted by the
facts found was open for consideration in the Circuit Court of Appeals,
and is so here.
Clark contracted with the railway company for the construction of part of
its road. He also contracted for the completion of his work on a day
named. It was not completed till some time after that day. Clark contended that the failure was caused by the neglect of the company to procure a right of way. When the time for settlement came there were also
other disputes between him and the company, which are set forth in detail in the statement of facts. The result was that Clark signed a paper
in which, after stating the disputed claims in detail, it was said: "Now
therefore be it known that I, the said Heman Clark, have received of and
from the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, the
sum of one hundred and seventy three thousand, five hundred and thirty

two and 4e-6 dollars, in full satisfaction of the amount due me on said
estimates, and in full satisfaction of all claims and demands of every
kind, name and nature, arising from or growing out of said contract of
March 6, 1886, and of the construction of said railroad, excepting the obligation of said railway company to account for said forty thousand dollars, as herein provided." This paper after signature was given by him
to the railway company, and in return they gave him a check for the
balance named. Five years and more after this transaction this action
was brought to recover the disputed claims. Held, that Clark was barred
by his release from recovering the disputed sums.
The rule lAid down in Cumber v. Wane, 1 Strange, 426, that where a liquidated sum is due, the payment of a less sum in satisfaction thereof,
though accepted as satisfaction, is not binding as such for want of consideration, has been much questioned and qualified, and is considered so
far with disfavor, as to be confined strictly to cases within it.
HEMAN Clark constructed some two hundred miles of rail-

road in the States of Iowa and Missouri,.for the Chicago, Milvaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, under a written contract dated March 6, 1886, which is set forth in the findings
hereafter referred to. During the period of construction the
company paid Clark large sums of money on account. After
the road was completed the Chief Engineer of the company, as
was his duty under the contract, certified to the total amount
that Clark had earned under the contract. This amount was
$3,895,798.79.
But Clark claimed also the further sum of
$3,598.90 for material sold by him to the company, and certain rebates and other matters of that description, which would
make the aggregate $3,930,397.69. As to the amount that
should be credited to the company, the company claimed credits
to the amount of $3,716,865.20, while Clark contended that the
total amount that should be credited was $3,667,306.59, or
$49,558.63 less than the amount claimed by the company. This
latter amount was made up of two items: one of $40,000, for
overtime forfeiture or penalty, and the other of $9558.63, the
amount paid by the company for nut locks furnished to Clark,
and used by him in the construction of the road. The company prepared an account stated, which allowed the $34,598.90,
on one side of the account, and included the $40,000 and the
$9558.6a, on the other, and appended to it a release for Clark
to sign, if he accepted the balance therein stated. The account

stated and release .were sent to him with notice that upon signing and returning the same to the Vice President of the company, a check for the balance shown by the account to be due
would be sent to him. Immediately thereupon, on March 9,
1888, the account and release were returned by Clark to the
Vice President, signed and witnessed, and a check for the full
amount of such balance, $173,532.29, was at once delivered to
Clark, who indorsed and deposited it in his bank, and received
the proceeds thereof.
August 5, 1893, Clark commenced this action against the railroad company to recover amounts which he claimed to be due
him on account of the construction of the road, and for extra
work and other claims growing out of the contract. The complaint originally contained three causes of action, but by amendment the number was increased to six. The second, third, fourth
and sixth causes of action, and part of the first cause, were
eliminated from the case by the judgment, and Clark recovered
on the two items of $40,000 and $9558.63 .under the first cause
of action, and also under the fifth cause for $2425, a matter
arising subsequent to the release, and not included within it.
The action was originally brought in the state court, but was
removed on the application of the company to the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Southern District of New York.
After issue was joined, the cause came on for trial at a regular
term of the Circuit Court. Trial by jury was waived by written consent of the parties, filed with the clerk, and the cause
was referred to a referee, who in due time made his report and
'findings. The court adopted the findings of the refbree and
ordered judgment thereon for the sum of $80,479.35. This
judgment was subsequently affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. 92 Fed. Rep. 968.
The findings of fact and conclusions of law of the referee were
as follows:

"6. That the plaintiff made and entered into a supplemental

trary, delayed the plaintiff in the performance of said contract
at a point upon the said road known as Minneville until October 27, 1887, by reason of the neglect, failure and omission of
the defendant to obtain the necessary right of way at said point
so as to permit the construction of the road and completion of
the contract at said point.

"12. That the plaintiff was ordered by the defendant to put
such nut locks on the road at the beginning of the work. That
he protested against their use, and finally yielded and used them
in track laying upon the promise that the matter of the charge

the contract.
"13. That upon the 9th day of March, 1888, the plaintiff
signed and caused to be delivered to a representative of the defendant a paper, writing or receipt presented to him by the

"2. That under the facts proved in this case, the plaintiff is
not legally liable to the defendant for any damages for failure

necessary right of way, from completing the said work in such
time.

any bar to the recovery of the plaintiff for the sums of $9558.63
and $40,000 otherwise as due under the contract.
"8. That the signing and delivery of said receipt, and the
acceptance of the check thereunder, do not constitute a legal
payment or accord and satisfaction of the said sums of $9558.63
and $40,000, or either of them, or any part or either of them.
"9. That no account of the transactions under this contract,
and of the claims sued on in this action, was ever had or stated

$80,479.35 with interest and costs, interest to be computed

additional findings of fact were made at the request of defendant. They related to, or set forth, the execution of the contract
for the construction of the road; a supplemental agreement by
which the sum of $40,000 was to be deducted from the contract

the sending of the statement of account and release to Clark,
with the information that, on the same being signed and returned by him, a check for the balance due him, $173,549,
would be sent to him; the return of said statement and release
signed by Clark, and the sending to him of a check for such balance, March 9, 1888; the deposit by Clark of said clieck and his
retention of the amount paid him thereon; thb expenditure of
the $40,000, (and the $521.75 besides,) reserved by the company,
with Clark's consent, at the time of the settlement, to meet unpaid claims against Clark, incurred in the construction of the
road; the furnishing of nut locks to Clark by the company for
the construction of the road; and that the company did not
require Clark to furnish any material or perform the work of
furnishing or erecting any structures of a more expensive design than required of him by the contract for the. construction
of the road, otherwise than as set forth in the-final estimate of
the Chief Engineer.
Amendments to the complaint were allowed by the referee
over defendant's objection and exception, and approved by the
court under like objection and exception.
The errors assigned were that: (1) The eourt below erred in
holding that the findings of fact supported the judgment as to
the item of $9558.63 for nut locks, and the item of $40,000 for
time forfeiture; (2) the court below erred in holding that there
was no consideration for the settlement made by the parties as
to the items of $9558.63 for nut locks, and $40,000 for time
forfeiture; (3) the court below erred in holding that the question whether there was any evidence in the record to sustain
the finding that the defendant in June, 1888, wrongfully took
possession of certain lumber and converted it to its own use was
not reviewable; (4) the court below erred in holding that it
was proper to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint on the
trial against defendant's objection, by adding thereto an action
sounding in tort and to recover thereon.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FuLLFR., after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The record shows that the cause came on before the District
Judge, holding the Circuit Court, for trial, "without a jury, and
a trial by jury having been expressly waived by the written
consent of the parties duly filed;" that a referee was appointed
by written consent in accordance with the modes of procedure
in such cases in the courts of record of New York, and with
the rules of the Circuit Court; and that his findings, rulings
and decisions #,ere made those of the court. Under these circumstances the question whether the judgment rendered was
warranted by the facts found was open for consideration in
the Circuit Court of Appeals, and is so here, and that is sufficient for the disposition of the case. Shipman v. Xining
Company, 158 U. S. 356.
By the writing executed and delivered by him, March 9,
1888, Clark acknowledged the receipt of $173,532.49 "in full
satisfaction of the amount due me on such estimates, and in
full satisfaction of all claims and demands of every kind, name
and nature, arising from, or growing out of such contract of
March 6, 1886, and of the construction of said railroad," excepting an item not material here. Five years and nearly five
months after the receipt of the money and the execution and
delivery of the discharge, this action was instituted. There was
no finding or contention that the settlement was procured by
fraud, or duress, or was the result of mutual mistake; nor was
there any finding that Clark did not have full knowledge of
all the facts at the time he signed and delivered the release,
and the presumption was that he had such knowledge. But
the proposition is that the release was given without consideration, and that Clark was entitled to recover so far as the items
of $40,000 and $9558.63 were concerned, on the principle that
where a liquidated sum is due, the payment of a less sum in
satisfaction thereof, though accepted as satisfaction, is not binding as such for want of consideration. Cumber v. Wane, 1
Strange, 426. The rule therein laid down has been much questioned and qualified. Goddard v. O'Bqien, 9 Q. B. Div. 37;

Mane in Smith's Leading Cases, vol. 1, 606; 12 Harvard Law
Review, 521.
The result of the modern cases is that the rule only applies
when the larger sum is liquidated, and when there is no consideration whatever for the surrender of part of it; and while
the general rule must be regarded as well settled, it is considered so far with disfavor as to be confined strictly to cases
within it.
In Johnston v. Brannan, 5 Johns. 268, 271, it was referred
to as "that rigid and rather unreasonable rule of the old law;"
and in K-ellogg v. Richards, 14 Wend. 116, where the acceptance of a promissory note of a third party for a less sum was
held to be a good accord and. satisfaction, Mr. Justice Nelson,
then a member of the Supreme Court of New York, said: "It
is true there does not seem to be much, if any, ground for distinction, between such a case and one where a less sum of money
is paid and agreed to be accepted in full, which would not be a
good plea. . . . The rule that the payment of a less sum
of money, though agreed by the plaintiff to be received in full
satisfaction of a debt exceeding that amount, shall not be so
considered in contemplation of law, is technical, and not very
well supported by reason. Courts therefore have departed
from it upon slight distinctions."
So in Brooks v. White, 2 MNetcalf, 283, the Supreme Judicial
The foundation of the rule
Court of Massachusetts said that: 11
seems therefore to be, that in the ease of the acceptance of a
less sum of money in discharge of a debt, inasmuch as there is
no new consideration, no benefit accruing to the creditor, and
no damage to the debtor, the creditor may violate, with legal
impunity, his promise to his debtor, however freely and understandingly made.. This 1'ule, which obviously may be urged in
violation of good faith, is not to be extended beyond its precise
import; and whenever a technical reason for its application
does not exist, the rule itself is not to be applied. Hence judges
have been disposed to take out of its application all those cases
where there was any new consideration, or any collateral bene-

The findings of fact bearing on the items of $40,000 for forfeiture, and $9558.63 for nut locks, exclude any other inference
than that there was a dispute between the parties in respect to
those items as to the facts on which the claim for their allowance was based. This being so, it is insisted that the total balance of $223,091.02, (as it would have been if $9558.63 had not
been deducted,) cannot be held to have been liquidated as a
whole, that is, agreed hpon by the parties or fixed by operation
of law, and that the contention cannot be sustained that where
there is a dispute as to an aggregate amount due, and the debtor
offers to pay so much thereof as he concedes to be correct, and
the creditor accepts, is paid and releases, nevertheless the cred-.
itor can afterward assert the disputed part of his claim on the
ground that he has only received what was undeniably due him.
In United States v. Bostwick, 94 U. S. 53, 67, it was said
that: "Payment by a debtor of a part of his debt is not a satisfaction of the whole except it bo made and accepted on
some new consideration;" while in Baird v. United States,
96 U. S.430, it was held that if the debt be unliquidated and
the amount uncertain, this rule does not apply. "In such cases
the question is whether the payment was in fact made and accepted in satisfaction."
In Fire Insurance Association v. Wickham, 141 U. S.564,
577, Mr. Justice Brown stated the doctrine thus: "The rule is

Opinion of the Court.

well established that where the facts show clearly a certain
sum to be due from one person to another, the release of the
entire sum upon payment of a part is without consideration,
and the creditor may still sue and recover the residue. Ifthere
be a bona fide dispute as to the amount due, such dispute may
be the subject of a compromise and payment of a certain sum
as a satisfaction of the entire claim, but where the larger sum
is admitted to be due, or the circumstances of the case show
that there was no good reason to doubt that it was due, the
release of the whole upon payment of part will not be considered as a compromise, but will be treated as without consideration and void."
In this case it cannot be said that at the time the release was
executed there was no good reason to doubt that these items
were open to dispute. The good faith of the company in claiming their allowance is not impugned, and as Judge Lacombe
said: "Both items. were legitimate matters of dispute, and
unless settled by agreement of parties, might fairly be brought
by either party into court."
And the cases are many in which it has been held that where
an aggregate amount is in dispute, the payment of a specified
sum conceded to be due, that is, by including certain items but
excluding disputed items, on condition that the sum so paid
shall be received in full satisfaction, will be sustained as an
extinguishment of the whole.
In Buller v. emp, 138 N. Y. 231, where certain items of an
account were disputed, and certain items were undisputed, and
defendant paid plaintiff only the amount of the undisputed
items, the court held that the dispute overcertain of the items
made the accpunt an unliquidated one, and that plaintiff, by
accepting the amount of the undisputed items with notice that
it was sent as payment in full, was precluded from recovering
the balance of his demand.
1Vfzeeoiy v.Tomlinson, 148 N. Y. 326, 330, is to the same
effect, and the court said: "A demand is not liquidated even if
it appears that something is due, unless it appears how much is
due, and when it is admitted that one of two specific sums is
due, but there is a genuine dispute as to which is the proper

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

amount, the *demand is regarded as unliquidated, within the
meaning of that term as applied to the subject of accord and
satisfaction."
In Ostranderv. Scott, 161 Ill. 339, plaintiff had an account
against defendant amounting to $5282.58, the items of which
were not in dispute, but defendant claimed that he was entitled
to be allowed the sum of $1210 for commissions, and accordingly he sent his check for the difference to plaintiff, at the
same time notifying him that it was sent in settlement of his
account in full, and if not accepted as such to return it. The
check was retained by plaintiff, and he afterwards brought
suit against defendant to recover the amount withheld, but the
Supreme Court of Illinois held that there could be no recovery,
and that an account cannot be considered as liquidated, so as to
prevent the receipt of a less amount as payment from operating
as a satisfaction, where there is a controversy over a set-off and
the amount of the balance.
In Tanner v. Mermrill, 108 Mich. 58, plaintiff sought to recover
a sum which had been deducted from his wages by defendants,
his employers. The amount of his wages was not disputed, but
the right to make any deduction was questioned. Plaintiff
received the amount of his wages less the deduction, and gave a
receipt in full, and afterwards brought suit to recover the balance on the ground that, having only received the amount
admitted to be due, there was no consideration for the release
as to that which was disputed. The Supreme Court of Mlichigan
held that the plaintiff could not recover, and that the rule that
a receipt of part payment to be effective in the discharge of the
entire debt must be rested upon a valid consideration, is limited
to cases where the debt is liquidated by agreement or otherwise; that a claim any portion of which is in dispute cannot be
considered to be liquidated within the meaning of the rule;
and that a receipt in full, given upon payment of the undisputed
part of the claim, after a refusal to pay another part which is
disputed, is conclusive as against the right of the creditor to
recover a further sum, in the absence of mistake, fraud, duress
or undue influence.
Without analyzing the cases, it should be added that it has

Opinion of the Court.

been frequently ruled by this court that a receipt in full must
be regarded as an acquittance in bar of any further d6mand in
the absence of any allegation and evidence that it was given in
ignorance of -its purport, or in circumstances constituting duress, fraud or mistake. De A'rnaud v. United States, 151 U. S.
483; United States v. Garlinger,169 U. S. 316, 322; United
States v. Adams, 7 Wall. 463; United States v. Child, 12 Wall.
232; United States v. Justice, 14 Wall. 535; Baker v. Nachtrieb, 19 How. 126.
The general principle applicable to settlements was thus expressed by Mr. Justice Clifford, in Hagarv. Thomson, 1 Black,
80, 93: "Much the largest number of controversies between
business men are ultimately settled by the parties themselves;
and when there is no unfairness, and all the facts are equally
known to both sides, an adjustment by them is final and conclusive. Oftentimes a party may be willing to yield something
for the sake of a settlement; and if he does so with a full knowledge of the circumstances, he cannot affirm the settlement, and
afterwards maintain a suit for that which he voluntarily surrendered."
But apart from the controversy over the two items of $40,000
and $9558.63, which was composed by the release, there was an
item of $31,558.90 credited to Clark in the final account, the
allowance of which, the company contends, furnished ample
consideration therefor, although the adequacy of the consideration is not, in such cases, open to inquiry.
The referee found: "That no other final settlement of the
accounts under said contracts bad been had between the plaintiff and the defendant at the time the said last-mentioned paper
was signed and delivered." "That no account was ever, otherwise than by said paper and the receipt of said money, stated of
the. transactions under and connected with said contract between
the plaintiff and .the defendant;" and also as a conclusion:
"That no account of the transactions under this contract, and
of the claims sued on in this action, was ever had or stated between the parties to this action, otherwise than by said receipt
or paper of March 9, 1888." The release in question allowed to

Opinion of the Court.

"for materials sold by him to said company, and certain rebates
and matters of that description;" and charged Clark, that is,
credited the company, with $40,000 by way of forfeiture, and
$9558.63 for nut locks. It was in this respect, in effect, a statement of cross-demands. The $40,000 was specifically described
and the $9558.63 was included in the total credits stated.
That this contractor, carrying on the work of building two
hundred miles of railroad, and receiving payments on vouchers
from time to time, must have been aware from his own books
and papers that the $9558.63 was thus included, can hardly be
reasonably denied, especially as he had objected to being charged
with it. Indeed we do not understand that there is any suggestion that Clark was ignorant of any part of the account.
As to the $34,558.90,.it appears from the contract, and final
certificate and estimate; which are set forth in the principal or
additional findings, that this item represented no part of the
work specified under the contract, nor extra work, nor materials
ordered by the company, and that it was not included in the
contract or in the certificate and final estimate.
As was said by Lacombe, J., who delivered the principal
opinion below: "Indeed it is plain to a demonstration from the
findings, that the item in question was not included either in
the original contract or in the extra work, and must represent
an additional and independent contract of sale." And the
learned judge further said: "From what has been said before,
it is plain ihat, if at the time of the transactions relied upon as
showing an accord and satisfaction, this sum of $34,598.90 so
allowed to claimant represented an unliquidated item, the
amount of which he would have to establish by evidence in case
he had sued to recover it, its allowance to him upon the settlement of March 9, 1888, would be a dufficient consideration to
uphold that settlement against him as an accord and satisfaction of all his claims." There was no finding that this amount
had ever been agreed upon or liquidated by the parties in a
manner that would have entitled Clark to have recovered the
amount from the company as an independent item, otherwise
than by the statement of it in the account preceding, and which
formed a part of the receipt and acknowledgment of satisfac-

Opinion of the Court.

tion which Clark executed and delivered to. the company
March 9, 1888. Nor was there any finding, showing, or tending to show, that the company would have placed that sum to
Clark's credit except as an item in an account which credited
the company with the two charges for nut locks and forfeiture.
But the Circuit Court of Appeals held that because of the
fourteenth finding of fact, it must be assumed that the referee
was satisfied from the testimony, though he did not so find in
terms, that the prior transactions between the parties were such
that this sum of $31,558.90 was as much liquidated. as was the
sum of $3,895,798.79, to which the Chief Engineer had certified.
Judge Lacombe said, referring to this particular item and to
the fourteenth finding of fact: "By what process it was so
liquidated does not appear in the findings. We must take his
finding, therefore, as conclusive upon the question, and assume
that either by an agreement for price in advance, or subsequently by entering into some binding agreement as to the sum
to be paid, the defendant had lost the right to throw the plaintiff into court as to that item."
The fourteenth finding of fact was "that said receipt and
paper contain a correct, truthful and undisputed account of all
dealings between said parties except in the matter of the $40,000
deducted for time forfeiture, the $9558.63 for nut locks embraced in the $3,626,865.20, and the lumber hereinafter referred
to, and herein valued at $2425." If this finding means that the
statement of account was incorrect, untruthful and disputed as
to the two items, it does not affirmatively say so, and if construed as amounting to that, it was not found that Clark did
not have full knowledge thereof at the time he received the
money and made the settlement. If it means that the statement of account as to these items was disputed, then the contention is a reasonable one that such dispute was a sufficient
consideration to support the settlement in its entirety. But we
must decline to accept the view that because of this finding it
should be assunied, without any finding to that effect, that there
had been prior transactions between Clark and the company,
by which the item of $34,558.90 was liquidated, for it is explic&
itly declared by the referee that no account of the transactions

Opinion of the Court.

under the contract, and of the claims sued on in this action,
was ever had or stated between the parties, otherwise than by
the paper of March 9, 1888. The value of the materials, rebates and other matters covered by this item may not have been
disputed, but it did not follow that the company was obliged
to purchase the materials or to allow the rebates, or that the
amount thereof had been previously agreed to; nor that liability therefor might not have been contested if Clark had declined to sign the proposed acknowledgment of satisfaction.
We must remember that Clark knew all about the account;
he knew what the company claimed, and what he claimed, yet
he accepted the check and signed the release without even a
protest.
The word "liquidated" is used in different senses, and as applicable here means made certain as to what and bow much is
due; made certain by agreement of parties or by operation of
law. We are of opinion that it would be going altogether too
far to treat the fourteenth finding, segregated from the others,
as equivalent to a determination that the $34,558.90 had been
liquidated independently of the whole account as stated.
And, on the face of the findings, we think the credit in Clark's
favor, taken in connection with the credits in the company's
favor, put this adjustment beyond the reach of this belated attempt to overhaul it, and that Clark was barred by his release
from recovering in this action the $40,000 and the $9558.63, as
having been improperly deducted.
As to the sum of $2425, that was the amount of a claim arising after the release was signed, and not included within it.
There was some evidence tending to sustain the findings of the
referee in support of this item, and we agree with the Circuit
Court of Appeals that no error was committed in the matter of
amending the complaint, and in holding that a recovery could
be had for this amount under the complaint as amended.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit is reversed, with costs; the judgment of the Circuit
Court for the Southern District of New York is also reversed,
and the cause remanded to the latter court, with a direction to
enter judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, for

MOFFETT, HODGKINS AND CLARKE COMPANY
v. ROCHESTER.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 217. Argued April 10, 11, 1900.-Decided May 21, 1900.

The city of Rochester invited proposals from contractors for two separate
contracts for work to be don6 for the improvement of its water works.
Among others who bid were the petitioners, the Moffett, etc. Company,
who put in bids for each. Owing to causes which are set forth in full
in the opinion of the court, some serious mistakes were made in the
figures in their proposals, whereby the compensation that they would receive if their bids were accepted and the work performed by them would
be diminished many thousand dollars. When the bids were opened by
the city government their bids were the first opened, and as they were
read aloud their engineer noticed the errors and called attention to them
and stated what the figures were intended to be and should be. The statutes of New York provided that "neither the principal nor sureties on any
bid or bond shall have the right to withdraw or cancel the same until
the board shall have let the contract for which such bid is made and the
same shall have been duly executed." The city government rejected one
of their bids and accepted the other, and called for its performance at the
prices stated in the bid. The company declined to enter into a contract
for the performance of the work at that price; and, claiming that the
city threatened to enforce the bond given with the proposals, brought
suit praying for a reformation of the proposals to conform to the asserted intention in making them and their execution as reformed, or their
rescission; and for an injunction against the. officers of the city, restraining them from declaring the complainant in default, and from forfeiting
or enforcing its bond. Judgment was rendered in the Circuit Court in
the company's favor, which was reversed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was then brought here on certiorari. Held:
