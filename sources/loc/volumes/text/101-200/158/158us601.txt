POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN AND TRUST COMPANY. (Rehearing.)
HYDE v. CONTINENTAL TRUST COMPANY.
(Rehearing.)
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Nos. 898, 894. Argued May 6, 7, 8, 1895. -Decided May 20, 1895.
Htylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, further considered, and, in view of the
historical evidence cited, shown to have only decided that the tax on carriages involved was an excise, and was therefore an indirect tax.
In distributing the power of taxation the Constitution retained to the States
the absolute power of direct taxation, but granted to the Federal government the power of the same taxation upon condition that, in its exercise,
such taxes should be apportioned among the several States according to
numbers; and this was done, in order to protect to the States, who were
surrendering to the Federal government so many sources of income, the
power of direct taxation, which was their principal remaining resource.
It is the duty of the court in this case simply to determine whether the
income tax now before it does or does not belong to the class of direct
taxes, and if it does, to decide the constitutional question which follows
accordingly, unaffected by considerations not pertaining to the case in
hand.
Taxes on real estate being indisputably direct taxes, taxes on the rents or
income of real estate are equally direct taxes.
Taxes on personal property, or on the income of personal property, are
likewise direct taxes.
The tax imposed by sections twenty-seven to thirty-seven, inclusive, of the
act of 1894, so far as it falls on the income of real estate and of personal
property, being a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution, and,
therefore, unconstitutional and void because not apportioned according
to representation, all those sections, constituting one entire scheme of
taxation, are necessarily invalid.

THESE cases were decided on the 8th of April, 1895, 157
U. S. 429. Thereupon the appellants filed a petition for a
rehearing as follows, entitled in the two cases:

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

To the tonorable the Justice8 of the Sireme Court of t71e
United States:

Charles Pollock and Lewis I. Hyde, the appellants in these
causes, respectfully present their petition for rehearing, and
submit the following reasons why their prayer should be
granted:
I. The question involved in these cases was as to the constitutionality of the provisions of the tariff act of August 15,
1894, (sections 27 to 37,) purporting to impose a tax upon
incomes. The court has held that the same are unconstitutional, so far as they purport to impose a tax upon the rent or
income of real estate and income derived from municipal bonds.
It has, however, announced that it was equally divided in
opinion as to the following questions, and has expressed no
opinion in regard to them:
(1) Whether the void provisions invalidate the whole act.
(2) Whether, as to the income from personal property as
such, the act is unconstitutional as laying direct taxes.
(3) Whether any part of the tax, if not considered as a
direct tax, is invalid for want of uniformity.
The court has reversed the decree of the Circuit Court and
remanded the case, with directions to enter a decree in favor
of complainant in respect only of the voluntary payment of
the tax on the rents and income of defendant's real estate and
that which it holds in trust, and on the income from the municipal bonds owned or so held by it.
While, therefore, the two points above stated have been
decided, there has been no decision of the remaining questions
regarding the constitutionality of the act, and no judgment
has been announced authoritatively establishing any principle
for interpretation of the statute in those respects. ]Eting v.
Bank qf the United States, 11 Wheat. 59, 78; Durant v. Essex
Co., 7 Wall. 107, 113.
This court, having been established by the Constitution,
and its judicial power extending to all cases in law and equity
arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States,
must necessarily be the ultimate tribunal for the determination of these questions. In all cases in which such questions

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

603

Rehearing.

may arise, there can, therefore, be no authoritative decision
in reference to the same except by this court.
II. The court early in its history adopted the practice of
requiring, if practicable, constitutional questions to be heard
by a full court in order that the judgment in such case might,
if possible, be the decision of the majority of the whole court.
In Briscoe v. CoMmonwealth Bankc, 8 Pet. 118, and City of
New Yorke v. lMiln, 8 Pet. 120, 122, this rule was announced
by Chief Justice Marshall in the following language:
"The practice of this court is, not (except in cases of absolute
necessity) to deliver any judgment in cases where constitutional questions are involved, unless four judges concur in
opinion, thus making the decision that of a majority of the
whole court. In the present cases four judges do not concur
in opinion as to the constitutional questions which have been
argued. The court therefore direct these cases to be reargued
at the next term, under the expectation that a larger number
of the judges may then be present."
The same cases were again called at the next term of the
court, and the Chief Justice said the court could not know
whether there would be a full court during the term; but as
the court was then composed, the constitutional cases would
not be taken up (9 Pet. 85). In a note to the cases upon that
page, it is stated that during that term, the court was composed of six judges, the full court at the time being seven;
there was then a vacancy occasioned by the resignation of
Mr. Justice Duval, which had not yet been filled.
The rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall has been frequently followed. Reference may be made to the case of
Lome Insurance Company v. New York, 119 U. S. 129, 148.
Mr. Chief Justice Waite there announced that the judgment
of the Supreme Court of the State of New York was affirmed
by a divided court. At the time, Mr. Justice Woods was ill
and absent during the whole of the term, and took no part in
any of the cases argued at that term. There were, therefore,
only eight members of the court present. A petition for
reargument was presented upon the ground that the principle
announced by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall should be followed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

and that the constitutional question involved was sufficiently
important to demand a decision concurred in by a majority of
the whole court. The petition was granted, 122 U. S. 636,
and the case was not reargued until the bench was full. 134:
U. S. 594, 597. This practice is recognized as established in
Phillips' Practice, at page 380.
III. It is respectfully submitted that no case could arise
more imperatively requiring the application of the rule than
the present. The precise question involved is the constitutionality of an act of Congress affecting the citizens of the country
generally. That act has been held unconstitutional in important respects; its constitutionality has not been authoritatively
decided as to the remaining portions. These complainants
and appellants may well urge, that these serious constitutional
questions should be finally decided before their trustee expends
their funds in voluntary payment of the tax. In addition, it
is manifest that, until some decision is reached, the courts will
be overwhelmed with litigation upon these questions, and the
payment and collection of the tax will be most seriously
embarrassed.
Every tax payer to any considerable extent will pay the tax
under protest and sue to recover the same back, and if necessary sue out his writ of error to this court. The court will of
necessity be burdened with rearguments of these questions
without number until they are finally settled. Still further,
as the matter now stands, it has been decided that a tax upon
the income of land is unconstitutional, while the court has
made no decision as to the validity of the tax upon income of
personal property. Serious questions have, therefore, already
arisen as to what is, in fact, to be deemed the income of real
estate, and what is the income of real and what of personal
property, in cases where both are employed in the production
of the same income.
Your petitioners, therefore, respectfully. pray that these
cases be restored to the docket and a reargument be ordered
as to the questions upon which the court was evenly divided
in opinion. In case, however, this motion should be denied,
your petitioners pray that the mandate be amended by order-

ing a new trial in the court below, so that the court below
may now determine the questions (1) whether or not the invalidity of the statute in the respects already specified renders
the same altogether invalid, and (2) whether or not the act is
constitutional in the respects not decided by this court.
The undersigned, members of the bar of this honorable
court, humbly conceive that it is proper that the appeals
herein should be reheard by this court, if this court shall see
fit so to order, and they therefore respectfully certify accordingly.

Of counsel for appellants.
To this petition Mr. Attorney General made the following
suggestion on the part of the United States:
The United States respectfully represents that, if a rehearing is granted in the above-entitled cases, the rehearing should
cover all the legal and constitutional questions involved, and
not merely those as to which the court are equally divided.
I. Whether a tax on incomes generally, inclusive of rents
and interest or dividends from investments of all kinds, is or
is not a direct tax within the meaning of the Federal Constitution is a matter upon which, as an original question, the government has really never been heard.
Its position at the argument was that the question had been
settled - by an exposition of the Constitution practically contemporaneous with its adoption -by a subsequent unbroken
line of judicial precedents -by
the concurring and repeated
action of all the departments of the government-and by
the consensus of all text writers and authorities by whom the
subject has heretofore been considered.
II. The importance to the government of the new views of
its taxing power, announced in the opinion of the Chief Justice, can hardly be exaggerated.
First. Pushed to their logical conclusion, they practically

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

exclude from the direct operation of the power all the real
estate of the country and all its invested personal property.
They exclude it because, if realty and personalty are taxable
only by the rule of apportionment, the inevitable inequalities
resulting from such a plan of taxation are so gross and flagrant
as to absolutely debar any resort to it.
That such inequalities must result is practically admitted,
the only suggestion in reply being that the power to directly
tax realty and personalty was not meant for use as an ordinary,
every-day power; that the United States was expected to rely
for its customary revenues upon duties, imposts, and excises ;
and that it was meant it should impose direct taxes only in
extraordinary emergencies and as a sort of dernier resort.
It is submitted that a construction of the Constitution of
such vital importance in itself and requiring in its support an
imputation to its framers of a specific purpose which nothing
in the text of the Constitution has any tendency to reveal, cannot be too carefully considered before being finally adopted.
Second. Though of minor consequence, it is certainly relevant to point out that, if the new exposition of the Constitution referred to is to prevail, the United States has under
previous income-tax laws collected vast sums of money which
on every principle of justice it ought to refund, and which it
must be assumed that Congress will deem itself bound to
make provision for refunding by appropriate legislation.
Respectfully submitted.

cation for a rehearing as to those propositions upon which the

the assessors to rate all the inhabitants of that colony "according to their estates or families, that is, according to goods, lands

The Massachusetts Bay Company, by its order of 1646
(Colonial Records of Massachusetts Bay, II, 173, 213, and
III, 88), assessed "laborers, artificers, and handicraftsmen,
and for all such persons as by advantage of their arts and
trades are more enabled to help bear the public charges than
the common laborers and workmen, as butchers, bakers, brewers, victuallers, smiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, joiners,
barbers, millers and masons, with all other manual persons
and artists, such are to be rated for returns and gains proportionable unto other men, for the produce of their estates."

The law thus remained and was gradually extended to
other forms of earnings than merely of "manual persons and
artists." In 1706, the tax was imposed on "incomes by any
trade or faculty." In 1738, the act was amended by adding
the words "business or employment." The act of 1777, which
was continued by the state constitution, levied the tax on
"incomes from any profession, faculty, handicraft, trade or
employment." This still remains the law, except that the
word "faculty" has been omitted since 1821, and the word
"handicraft" since 1849.
All estates, real and personal, were to be rated in 1692 "at
a quarter part of one year's value or income thereof." In
1693 it was provided that "all houses, warehouses, tan-yards,
orchards, pastures, meadows and lands, mills, cranes and
wharves be estimated at seven years' income as they are or
may be let for." A. iR. P., M. B. I., 29, 92, 413.
Rhode Island. - In 1774, the statute directed "that the
assessors in all and every rate shall consider all persons who
make profit by their faculties and shall rate them accordingly." Acts and Laws of Rhode Island, Newport, 1845,
p. 295. The rate makers were "to take a narrow inspection
of the lands and meadows and to judge of the yearly profit
at their wisdom and discretion." Colonial Records of R. I.,
III, 300.
Connecticut.- A faculty tax was placed on all manual persons and artists, following the Massachusetts law of 1646, and
these provisions were frequently repeated in the laws of the
seventeenth century. 1 Colonial Records, 548; see, too, Laws
of Connecticut, published in 1769.

Appellants' Authorities.

This report (7 American State Papers, I Finance, 414-431)
was made in obedience to a resolution of the House of Representatives, passed on the 4th day of April, 1796. The report
says: "The duty enjoined is to ' report a plan for laying and
collecting direct taxes by apportionment among the several
States agreeably to the rule prescribed by the Constitution;
adapting the same as nearly as may be to such objects of
direct taxation and such modes of collection, as may appear
by the laws and practice of the States respectively to be most
eligible in each,' " recommends a direct tax of $1,484,000, and
states the apportionment thereof among the States. The report states among the articles taxed in States in addition to
land as follows:
Vermont. - Cattle and horses, money on hand or due, and
obligations to pay money. Assessments proportioned to the
profits of all lawyers, traders and owners of mills, according
to the judgment or discretion of the listers or assessors
(p. 418).
New Hampshire.- Stock in trade, money on hand or at
interest more than the owner pays interest for, and all )ro)erty in public funds, estimated at its real value; mills,
woharves and ferries at one-twelfth part of their yearly net incoMe, after deducting repairs.
Massachusetts. - Vessels, stock in trade, securities, all
moneys on hand or placed out at interest exceeding the sum
due on interest by the individual creditor; silver plate, stock
owned by stockholders in any bank, horses, cattle and swine
(p. 420).
Rhode Island. -Polls and the collective mass of property,
both real and personal (p. 422).
Connecticut. - Stock, carriages, plate, clocks and watches,
credits on interest exceeding the debts due on interest by the
individual creditors ; assessments apportioned to the estimated
gains or profits arising from any and all lucrative professions,
trades and occupations (p. 423).
New Jersey.- Ferries, fisheries, vessels, carriages, personal
taxes on shopkeepers, single men and slaves (p. 426).
New York. - Assessments in the towns determined by a

discretionary estimate of the collective and individual wealth
of corporations and individuals (p. 425).
Pennsylvania. - Prior to 1789, the time of servitude of
bound servants, slaves, horses and cattle, plate, carriages;
ferries, all offices and posts of profit, trades, occupations and
professions, with reference to their respective profits. Subsequently ground rents, slaves, horses, cattle, provisions, trades
and callings (pp. 427, 428).
Delaware. - Taxes have been hitherto collected of the estimated annual income of the inhabitants of the State, with
reference to specific objects. A statute has been passed during
the past year declaring that all real and personal property
shall be taxed; provision is made for ascertaining the stock
of merchants, traders, mechanics and manufacturers for the
purpose of regulating assessments upon such persons, proportioned to their gains and profits; ground rents are estimated
at one hundred pounds for every eight _pounds of rent. Reents
of hoauses and lots in cities, towns and villages at one hiundred
poundsfor every twelve pounds of rent reserved (p. 429).
Maryland. - Taxes are imposed on the mass of property in
general, there are licenses for attorneys at law for admission
to the bar £3, and the like sum annually during his continuance
to practise; licenses to retail spirituous liquors ; to keep taverns ; for marriage (p. 430).
Virginia. - A tax on lots and houses in towns, and the tenant or proprietor wvas required to disclose on oath or a/ir nation the amoutnt of rent paid or received by them respectively;

licenses, billiard tables, legal proceedings (pp. 431, 432).
North Carolina. - Slaves, stud horses, licensed ordinaries
and houses for retailing spirituous liquors in small quantities,
legal proceedings, billiard tables (pp. 433, 434).

The report continues: "-Lands in Massachusetts and New
,Hampshireare taxed according to their produce or supposed
annual rent or profit."
Stock employed in trade or manufactures and moneys loaned
on interest are taxed on different principles in different States.
Assessments at discretion on the supposed property or income of individuals are permitted in various degrees and under different modifications in some States. In other States
all taxes attach to certain defined objects at prescribed rates.
It is assmned as a principle that all objects of income,
whether consisting of scilled labor or capital, bear certain
relations to each other, which may be defined to be their
naturalvalue.
The value, therefore, is determined by the degree of labor,
skill and expense necessary to be bestowed on the subject
(p. 437).
Taxes on stock employed in trade and manufactures and
on moneys loaned at interest. It is believed that direct taxes
on these subjects, except in extraordinaryand temporary emergencies, are impolitic, unequal and delusive (p. 439).
Taxes on lands. Taxes _proortioned to the value of improved
lands, and taxes _proportionedto their produce or actual income
or rent are nearly, if not entirely, alike in principle (p. 439).
As the Constitution has established a rule of apportionment,
there appears to be no necessity that the principles of valuation should be uniform in all the States (p. 441).
In the schedule annexed to the report, under the head of
"The objects of taxation," are the following, among others:
New Hampshire. - Money on hand or at interest; threequarters per cent (p. 442).
Massachusetts. - Funded securities. Securities of the State
or United States; money at interest; money on hand (p. 437).
Connecticut. - Aimount of money .at interest; assessments
on lawyers, shop-keepers, surgeons, physicians, merchants, etc.
(p. 455).
Virginia. - Ordinary licenses (p. 459).
South Carolina.- On faculties, &c. (p. 464).

much detail the advantages and disadvantages of levying a
direct tax upon the various kinds of personal properties, there
is not a suggestion of doubt that they could constitutionally
be taxed directly.
Mrb. Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General
Whitney for the United States.
Their briefs and argument on the rehearing contained
among other things the following new matter bearing upon
the direct tax question, and in particular upon the question
relating to the income of real and personal property:
I. Historicaldiscussion. The tax clauses of the Constitution, when they left the committee on style, were worded
with great care and with reference to some standard classification which it was assumed would solve all difficulties. The
classification was as follows: direct taxes by apportionment ;
capitation taxes by apportionment ; duties, imposts and excises,
by uniformity. The classification of capitation taxes among
the direct taxes came in at the last moment by an amendment. The phrase "direct" tax had then no legal meaning.
It was borrowed from political economy; and with some economists included only land taxes (Locke and Mercier de la Rivi6re), while with others it included also capitation taxes, but
not taxes on the profits of money or industry, etc. (Turgot).
The word "duties" had, however, a legal signification which
was appealed to by Mr. Wilson (afterwards Mr. Justice
Wilson) speaking in the Constitutional Convention for the
Committee on Detail (5 Elliott's Debates, 432). He evidently
referred to the familiar English use of the term found in
Blackstone (1 B1. Com. c. VIII) and in the English statute
books. These duties, as summed up in Mr. Pitt's consolidated
fund act of 1787, (27 Geo. III. c. 13,) included the "duties on
customs, excises and stamps" and also the duties on hackney
coaches and chairs; on hawkers and pedlars; on houses, windows and lights; on inhabited houses; on salaries and pensions; on shops; on coaches, etc. The stamp duties, as shown
by the famous stamp act of 1765, (5 Geo. III. c. 12,) included

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

United States Authorities.

duties on bonds for securing payment of money; on grants
or deeds of land; on leases, conveyances, mortgages, records
of deeds, etc. Pitt's famous act of 1799 levied a duty on
incomes. The only " tax" levied in Great Britain during that
century (capitation taxes being obsolete) was that known as
the "land tax." In fact, in Great Britain the words "tax" and
"duty" had had legal definitions for a century, exclusive of
each other, settled and unvarying in their statutory use. A
tax was laid upon all property, or upon all real property, at a
valuation, and always by a rule of apportionment. Everything that was not a tax in this restricted sense was a duty.
No duties were laid by any system of apportionment; all
were laid by a rule of uniformity. There was an accuracy
and consistency in the statutory phraseology which is very
rare to find. This is the more remarkable, as in colloquial
parlance the words were used very loosely.
In taxation there was no uniform system or approach to a
uniform system among the States. The terminology differed
in different States; and there was nowhere a recognized
definition of "duties" to which Mr. Wilson's explanation
can have referred. For this reason, and for the reason
that the English classification was well settled, familiar to
American lawyers, and based on the distinction between the
system of apportionment and the system of uniformity, it is
believed that the word "duties" in the Constitution is used
in the broad English sense. This theory is entirely consistent
with the lylton, Pacflc Insurance, Veaoie Bank, &holey and
Springer cases. It also explains why the debate turned not
upon what taxes should be apportioned, but upon how the apportionment should be made; not upon what duties should
be laid by the rule of uniformity, but whether they might be
local (like the English duty upon hackney coaches in London
and vicinity), or must extend throughout the United States.
It is also to be noticed that a general property tax in a large
State or nation, if laid by valuation, must necessarily be apportioned. This is because the valuing must be done by local
people. Each assessor endeavors to favor his own locality by
a low rating. Each of the three great English systems of

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

615

United States Authorities.

general property taxes (the " fifteenths and tenths," the "subsidies" and the land tax of William and Mary) very quickly
reached the stage of a permanent apportionment, for the
same reason that such taxes in America have usually been
executed by means of periodical valuations or an annual equalization by a board of state officers.
Hence, by the words "direct tax," as distinguished from
duties, the delegates bad in mind a general apportioned tax
upon property by valuation. As some of the American systems included all personalty as well as land in such a tax,
doubts afterwards arose whether a general personalty tax by
valuation was a direct tax. There is no sufficient foundation
for the theory that any specific duties, whether upon real or
personal property, were included in the term, and the then
unknown general income tax remained to be classed by analogy when it should be discovered.
The proceedings of the state conventions of 1788 are not
competent evidence upon this point. Aldridge v. Williams,
3 how. 1, 24; United States v. Union Pacific Railroad, 91
U. S. 72, 79 ; Taylor v. Taylor, 10 Minnesota, 107. Few are reported at all; and those not fully. The most important part
of the debates is often omitted. 2 Elliott's Debates, 101, 104,
109. The controversial literature of that time is also incompetent; nor do these proceedings and literature afford any
evidence against our theory, except from Madison and a few
others, whose own theories were squarely overruled by the
Hfylton case.
The departmental reports and the proceedings and acts of
Congress during the first decade after the Constitution confirm
our theory of the case. They show that the word "duty" was
used in the broad English sense and applicable to specific indirect taxes upon real and personal property, such as taxes on
conveyances, successions, auction sales, etc.; and also that there
was no principle forbidding such duties, or direct taxation of
any kind, in times of peace. Acts of March 3, 1791, c. 15;

United States Authorities.

Mr. Madison seems to have been the only prominent member
of the Constitutional Convention who took a different view.
I1. Personal_properly taxes. There was never any doubt
that taxes on choses in action were indirect taxes or duties.
They were "stamp duties" as shown by the famous English
stamp act of 1765 and the other similar acts of that century,
and by the United States stamp act of 1797. See also I
Elliott's Debates, pp. 368-9. The question debated in the
Ifylton case concerned duties on choses in possession.
III. Rentals. Rentals actually collected can be subjected
to a duty laid by the rule of uniformity for the following
reasons: A specific tax on a specific class of real property,
laid by the rule of uniformity, as on houses or windows, was a
duty under the legal definitions of the last century; such a
tax cannot have been intended to be apportioned; it has no
relation to either the quantity or the valuation of the land ; it
is a tax not resting on the land, but placed 6n the landlord or
ex-landlord with respect to the land. See Platt on Covenants,
pp. 222-3, 215; Jeffrey's Case, 5 Rep. 66 b; Theed v. Starkey,
8 Mod. 314; Case v. Stephens, Fitzgibbon, 297; Palmer v.
Power, 4 Irish C. L. (1854) 191; Van Rensselaer v. Dennison,
8 Barb. 23; it is not a direct tax in political economy, as a tax
on house rent falls largely on the occupier, 2 Mill's Political
Economy, ed. 1864, pp. 429-431; Seligman on Shifting and
Incidence of Taxation; Secretary Wolcott's Report, 1796, 7
American State Papers; it is less direct than a succession tax,
and therefore within the Scholey case.
It is said that what cannot be done directly cannot be done
indirectly. This is undoubtedly true when correctly interpreted. It cannot mean in a broad sense that whatever is
taxed directly cannot be taxed indirectly, because the very
distinction under consideration is one between direct and indirect taxation. The correct application of this rule, as we
understand it, is that no tax can be laid under the rule of uniformity which in its actual incidence is substantially or approximately the same as the tax which the Constitution intends
should be levied by the rule of apportionment. There is no
such identity between a tax on rents actually collected, and a

general land tax by valuation. If it could be separately considered, it would be analogous not to a property tax, but to an
occupation duty.
It is not, however, a tax on rentals at all. It is not a tax
measured by anything present. It is measured simply by the
taxpayer's ability to pay as indicated by his income for the
previous year. The rentals have become moneys inextricably
mingled with the other funds of the taxpayer,

CuTIEF

Jus'riCE FULLER delivered the opinion of the

court.
Whenever this court is required to pass upon the validity of
an act of Congress as tested by the fundamental law enacted
by the people, the duty imposed demands in its discharge the
utmost deliberation and care, and invokes the deepest sense of
responsibility. And this is especially so when the question
involves the exercise of a great governmental power, and brings
into consideration, as vitally affected by the decision, that
complex system of government, so sagaciously framed to
secure and perpetuate "an indestructible Union, composed of
indestructible States."
We have, therefore, with an anxious desire to omit nothing
which might in any degree tend to elucidate the questions
submitted, and aided by further able arguments embodying
the fruits of elaborate research, carefully reexamined these
cases, with the result that, while our former conclusions remain
unchanged, their scope must be enlarged by the acceptance of
their logical consequences.
The very nature of the Constitution, as observed by Chief
Justice Marshall, in one of his greatest judgments, "requires
that only its great outlines should be marked, its important
objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose
those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves." "In considering this question, then, we must never
forget, that it is a Con8titution that we are expounding."

As heretofore stated, the Constitution divided Federal taxa-

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Opinion of the Court.

tion into two great classes, the class of direct taxes, and the
class of duties, imposts, and excises; and prescribed two rules.
which qualified the grant of power as to each class.
The power to lay direct taxes apportioned among the
several States in proportion to their representation in the
popular branch of Congress, a representation based on population as ascertained by the census, was plenary and absolute;
but to lay direct taxes without apportionment was forbidden.
The power to lay duties, imposts, and excises was subject to
the qualification that the imposition must be uniform throughout the United States.
Our previous decision was confined to the consideration of
the validity of the tax on the income from real estate, and on
the income from municipal bonds. The question thus limited
was whether such taxation was direct or not, in the meaning
of the Constitution; and the court went no farther, as to the
tax on the income from real estate, than to hold that it fell
within the same class as the source whence the income was
derived, that is, that a tax upon the realty and a tax upon the
receipts therefrom were alike direct; while as to the income
from municipal bonds, that could not be taxed because of
want of power to tax the source, and no reference was made
to the nature of the tax as being direct or indirect.
We are now permitted to broaden the field of inquiry, and
to determine to which of the two great classes a tax upon a
person's entire income, whether derived from rents, or products,
or otherwise, of real estate, or from bonds, stocks, or other
forms of personal property, belongs; and we are unable to
conclude that the enforced subtraction from the yield of all
the owner's real or personal property, in the manner prescribed,
is so different from a tax upon the property itself, that it is
not a direct, but an indirect tax, in the meaning of the Constitution.
The words of the Constitution are to be taken in their obvious sense, and to have a reasonable construction. In Gibjon8
v. Ogden, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, with his usual felicity,
said: " As men, whose intentions require no concealment,
generally employ the words which most directly and aptly

express the ideas they intend to convey, the enlightened patriots who framed our Constitution, and the people who adopted
it must be understood to have employed words in their natural
sense, and to have intended what they have said." 9 Wheat.
1, 188. And in Rhode ]island v. - assachusett8, where the
question was whether a controversy between two States over
the boundary between them was within the grant of judicial
power, Mr. Justice Baldwin, speaking for the court, observed:
"The solution of this question must necessarily depend on the
words of the Constitution; the meaning and intention of the.
convention which framed and proposed it for adoption and
ratification to the conventions of the people of and in the several States; together with a reference to such sources of judicial information as are resorted to by all courts in construing
statutes, and to which this court has always resorted in construing the Constitution." 12 Pet. 657, 721.
We know of no reason for holding otherwise than that the
words "direct taxes," on the one hand, and "duties, imposts
and excises," on the other, were used in the Constitution in
their natural and obvious sense. Nor, in arriving at what
those terms embrace, do we perceive any ground for enlarging
them beyond, or narrowing them within, their natural and
obvious import at the time the Constitution was framed and
ratified.
And, passing from the text, we regard the conclusion reached
as inevitable, when the circumstances which surrounded the
convention and controlled its action and the views of those
who framed and those who adopted the Constitution are
considered.
We do not care to retravel ground already traversed; but
some observations may be added.
In the light of the struggle in the convention as to whether
or not the new Nation should be empowered to levy taxes directly on the individual until after the States had failed to respond to requisitions - a struggle which did not terminate until
the amendment to that effect, proposed by Massachusetts and
concurred in by South Carolina, New Hampshire, New York,
and Rhode Island, had been rejected -it would seem beyond

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

Opinion of the Court.

reasonable question that direct taxation, taking the place as
it did of requisitions, was purposely restrained to apportionment according to representation, in order that the former
;system as to ratio might be retained, while the mode of collection was changed.
This is forcibly illustrated by a letter of Mr. Madison of
January 29, 1789, recently published,' written after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the organization of
the government and the submission of the proposed amendment to Congress, which, while opposing the amendment as
calculated to impair the power, only to be exercised*in extraordinary emergencies," assigns adequate ground for its rejection as substantially unnecessary, since, be says, "every State
which chooses to collect its own quota may always prevent
,a Federal collection, by keeping a little beforehand in its
finances, and making its payment at once into the Federal
treasury."
The reasons for the clauses of the Constitution in respect of
direct taxation are not far to seek. The States, respectively,
possessed plenary powers of taxation. They could tax the
property of their citizens in such manner and to such extent
as they saw fit; they had unrestricted powers to impose duties
or imposts on imports from abroad, and excises on manufactures, consumable commodities, or otherwise. They gave up
the great sources of revenue derived from commerce; they
retained the concurrent power or levying excises, and duties if
covering anything other than excises; but in respect of them
the range of taxation was narrowed by the power granted
over interstate commerce, and by the danger of being put at
disadvantage in dealing with excises on manufactures. They
retained the power of direct taxation, and to that they looked
as their chief resource; but even in respect of that, they
granted the concurrent power, and if the tax were placed by
both governments on the same subject, the claim of the United
States had preference. Therefore, they did not grant the
power of direct taxation without regard to their own condition

and resources as States; but they granted the power of apportioned direct taxation, a power just as efficacious to serve the,
needs of the general government, but securing to the States,
the opportunity to pay the amount apportioned, and to recoup,
from their own citizens in the most feasible way, and in harmony with their systems of local self-government. If, in the,
changes of wealth and population in particular States, apportionment produced inequality, it was an inequality stipulated
for, just as the equal representation of the States, however'
small, in the Senate, was stipulated for. The Constitution
ordains affirmatively that each State shall have two members.
of that body, and negatively that no State shall by amendment.
be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate without its consent. The Constitution ordains affirmatively that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several
States according to numbers, and negatively that no direct tax
shall be laid unless in proportion to the enumeration.
The founders anticipated that the expenditures of the States,
their counties, cities, and towns, would chiefly be met by
direct taxation on accumulated property, while they expected
that those of the Federal government would be for the most
part met by indirect taxes. And in order that the power of
direct taxation by the general government should not be exercised, except on necessity; and, when the necessity arose,
should be so exercised as to leave the States at liberty to
discharge their respective obligations, and should not be so
exercised, unfairly and discriminatingly, as to particular States,
or otherwise, by a mere majority vote, possibly of those whose
constituents were intentionally not subjected to any part of the
burden, the qualified grant was made. Those who made it
knew that the power to tax involved the power to destroy,
and that, in the language of Chief Justice Marshall, in IfCalloch v. Marylcnd,"the only security against the abuse of this
power is found in the structure of the government itself. In
imposing a tax, the legislature acts upon its constituents. This
is, in general, a sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation." 4 Wheat. 428. And they retained this security by providing that direct taxation and representation in

the lower house of Congress should be adjusted on the same
measure.
Moreover, whatever the reasons for the constitutional provisions, there they are, and they appear to us to speak in plain
language.
It is said that a tax on the whole income of property is not
a direct tax in the meaning of the Constitution, but a duty,
and, as a duty, leviable without apportionment, whether direct
or indirect. We do not think so. Direct taxation was not
restricted in one breath, and the restriction blown to the
winds in another.
Cooley (On Taxation, p. 3) says that the word "ditt"
ordinarily "means an indirect tax imposed on the importation,
exportation or consumption of goods;" having "a broader
meaning than custom, which is a duty imposed on imports or
exports;" that "the term impost also signifies any tax, tribute
or duty, but it is seldom applied to any but the indirect taxes.
An excise duty is an inland impost, levied upon articles of manufacture or sale, and also upon licenses to pursue certain trades
or to deal in certain commodities."
In the Constitution, the words "duties, imposts and
excises" are put in antithesis to direct taxes. Gouverneur
Morris recognized this in his remarks in modifying his celebrated motion, as did Wilson in approving of the motion as
modified. 5 Ell. Deb. (Madison Papers) 302. And Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution, (§ 952,)
expresses the view that it is not unreasonable to presume that
the word "duties" was used as equivalent to "customs" or
"imposts" by the framers of the Constitution, since in other
clauses it was provided that "No tax or duty shall be laid on
articles exported from any State," and that "No State shall,
without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on
imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary
for executing its inspection laws;" and he refers to a letter of
Mr. Madison to Mr. Cabell, of September 18, 1828, to that
effect. 3 Madison's Writings, 636.
In this connection it may be useful, though at the risk of
repetition, to refer to the views of Hamilton and Madison as

thrown into relief in the pages of the Federalist, and in respect of
the enactment of the carriage tax act, and again to briefly consider the Ilylton case, 3 Dall. 171, so much dwelt on in argument.
The act of June 5, 1794, c. 45, 1 Stat. 373, laying duties
upon carriages for the conveyance of persons, was enacted in
a time of threatened war. Bills were then pending in Congress to increase the military force of the United States, and to
authorize increased taxation in various directions. It was, therefore, as much a part of a system of taxation in war times, as was
the income tax of the war of the rebellion. The bill passed
the House on the twenty-ninth of May, apparently after a very
short debate. Mr. Madison and Mr. Ames are the only speakers on that day reported in the Annals. "Mr. Madison objected to this tax on carriages as an unconstitutional tax ; and,
as an unconstitutional measure, he would vote against it."
Mr. Ames said: " It was not to be wondered at if he, coming
from so different a part of the country, should have a different
idea of this tax from the gentleman who spoke last. In
Massachusetts, this tax had been long known; and there it
was called an excise. It was difficult to define whether a tax
is direct or not. He had satisfied himself that this was not
so." Annals, 3d Cong. 730.
On the first of June, 1794, Mr. Madison wrote to Mr. Jefferson: "The carriage tax, which only struck at the Constitution,
has passed the House of Representatives." 3 Madison's Writings, 18. The bill then went to the Senate, where, on the
third day of June, it "was considered and adopted," Annals,
3d Cong. 119, and on the following day it received the signature of President Washington. On the same third day of June
the Senate considered "an act laying certain duties upon snuff
and refined sugar;" "an act making further provisions for
securing and collecting the duties on foreign and domestic distilled spirits, stills, wines, and teas;" "an act for the more
effectual protection of the Southwestern frontier;" "an act
laying additional duties on goods, wares and merchandise,
etc.;" "an act laying duties on licenses for selling wines and
foreign distilled spirituous liquors by retail ;" and "an act laying duties on property sold at auction."

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Opinion of the Court.

It appears then that Mr. Madison regarded the carriage tax
bill as unconstitutional, and accordingly gave his vote against
it, although it was to a large extent, if not altogether, a war
measure.
Where did Mr. Hamilton stand? At that time he was
Secretary of the Treasury, and it may therefore be assumed,
without proof, that he favored the legislation. But upon
what ground? Ile must, of course, have come to the conclusion that it was not a direct tax. Did he agree with Fisher
Ames, his personal and political friend, that the tax was an
excise? The evidence is overwhelming that he did.
In the thirtieth number of the Federalist, after depicting
the helpless and hopeless condition of the country growing out
of the inability of the confederation to obtain from the States
the moneys assigned to its expenses, he says: " The more
intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit the force
of this reasoning; but they qualify their admission, by a
distinction between what they call internal and external
taxations. The former they would reserve to the state governments; the latter, which they explain into commercial imposts,
or rather duties on imported articles, they declare themselves
willing to concede to the Federal head." In the thirty-sixth
number, while still adopting the division of his opponents, he
says: "The taxes intended to be comprised under the general
denomination of internal taxes, may be subdivided into those
of the direct and those of the indirect kind. . . . As to
the latter, by which must be understood duties and excises on
articles of consumpotion, one is at a loss to conceive, what can
be the nature of the difficulties apprehended." Thus we find
Mr. Hamilton, while writing to induce the adoption of the Constitution, first, dividing the power of taxation into external
and internal, putting into the former the power of imposing
duties on imported articles and into the latter all remaining
powers; and, second, dividing the latter into direct and indirect,putting into the latter, duties and excises on articles of
consumption.
It seems to us to inevitably follow that in Mr. Hamilton's
judgment at that time all internal taxes, except duties and

Rehearing.

LOAN & TRUST CO.

Opinion of the Court.

excises on articles of consumption, fell into the category of
direct taxes.
Did he, in supporting the carriage tax bill, change his views
in this respect ? His argument in the Iylton case in support
of the law enables us to answer this question. It was not
reported by Dallas, but was published in 1851 by his son in
the edition of all Hamilton's writings except the Federalist.
After saying that we shall seek in vain for any legal meaning
of the respective terms" direct and indirect taxes," and after
forcibly stating the impossibility of collecting the tax if it is
to be considered as a direct tax, he says, doubtingly: " The
following are presumed to be the only direct taxes. Capitation
or poll taxes. Taxes on lands and buildings. General assess'
ments, whether on the whole property of individuals, or on their
whole real or personal estate; all else must of necessity be
considered as indirect taxes." " Dities, imposts and excises
appear to be contradistinguished from taxes." "If the meaning
of the word excise is to be sought in the British statutes, it will
be found to include the duty on carriages, which is there considered as an excise." "Where so important a distinction in
the Constitution is to be realized, it is fair to seek the meaning of terms in the statutory language of that country from
which our jurisprudence is derived." 7 Hamilton's Works, 848.
Mr. Hamilton therefore clearly supported the law which Mr.
Madison opposed, for the same reason that his friend Fisher
Ames did, because it was an excise, and as such was specifically
comprehended by the Constitution. Any loose expressions in
definition of the word "direct," so far as conflicting with his
well-considered views in the Federalist, must be regarded as
the liberty which the advocate usually thinks himself entitled
to take with his subject. ie gives, however, it appears to us,
a definition which covers the question before us. A tax upon
one's whole income is a tax upon the annual receipts from his
whole property, and as such falls within the same class as a
tax upon that property, and is a direct tax, in the meaning of
the Constitution. And Mr. Hamilton in his report on the
public credit, in referring to contracts with citizens of a foreign
country, said: "This principle, which seems critically correct,

would exempt as well the income as the capital of the property.
It protects the use, as effectually as the thing. What, in fact,
is property, but a fiction, without the beneficial use of it?
In many cases, indeed, the income or annuity is the property
itself." 3 Hamilton's Works, 34.
We think there is nothing in the Itylton case in conflict
with the foregoing. The case is badly reported. The report
does not give the names of both the judges before whom the
case was argued in the Circuit Court. The record of that
court shows that Mr. Justice Wilson was one and District
Judge Griffin of Virginia was the .other. Judge Tucker in
his appendix to the edition of Blackstone published in 1803,
(Tucker's Blackstone, vol. 1, part 1, p. 294,) says: "The
question was tried in this State, in the case of United States
v. iylton, and the court being divided in opinion, was carried
to the Supreme Court of the United States by consent. It
was there argued by the proposer of it, (the first Secretary
of the Treasury,) on behalf of the United States, and by the
present Chief Justice of the United States, on behalf of the
defendant. Each of those gentlemen was supposed to have
defended his own private opinion. That of the Secretary of
the Treasury prevailed, and the tax was afterwards submitted
to, universally, in Virginia."
We are not informed whether Mr. Marshall participated in
the two days' hearing at Richmond, and there is nothing of
record to indicate that he appeared in the case in this court;
but it is quite probable that Judge Tucker was aware of the
opinion which he entertained in regard to the matter.
Mr. Hamilton's argument is left out of the report, and in
place of it it is said that the argument turned entirely upon
tlie point whether the tax was a direct tax, while his brief
shows that, so far as he was concerned, it turned upon the
point whether it was an excise, and therefore not a direct
tax.
Mr. Justice Chase thought that the tax was a tax on
expense, because a carriage was a consumable commodity,
and in that view the tax on it was on the expense of the owner.
He expressly declined to give an opinion as to what were the

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Opinion of the Court.

direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution. Mr. Justice
Paterson said: "All taxes on expenses or consumption are
indirect taxes; a tax on carriages is of this kind." ie quoted
copiously from Adam Smith in support of his conclusions,
although it is now asserted that the justices made small
account of that writer. Mr. Justice Iredell said: "There is
no necessity, or propriety, in determining what is or is not, a
direct, or indirect, tax, in all cases. It is sufficient, on the
present occasion, for the court to be satisfied, that this is not
a direct tax contemplated by the Constitution."
What was decided in the JIylon case was, then, that a tax
on carriages was an excise, and, therefore, an indirect tax.
The contention of Mr. Madison in the House was only so far
disturbed by it, that the court classified it where he himself
would have held it constitutional, and he subsequently as
President approved a similar act. 3 Stat. 40. The contention of Mr. Hamilton in the Federalist was not disturbed by
it in the least. In our judgment, the construction given to
the Constitution by the authors of the Federalist (the five
numbers contributed by Chief Justice Jay related to the
danger from foreign force and influence, and to the treatymaking power) should not and cannot be disregarded.
The Constitution prohibits any direct tax, unless in proportion to numbers as ascertained by the census; and, in the light
of the circumstances to which we have referred, is it not an
evasion of that prohibition to hold that a general unapportioned tax, imposed upon all property owners as a body for
or in respect of their property, is not direct, in the meaning
of the Constitution, because confined to the income therefrom ?
Whatever the speculative views of political economists or
revenue reformers may be, can it be properly held that the
Constitution, taken in its plain and obvious sense, and with
due regard to the circumstances attending the formation of
the government, authorizes a general unapportioned tax on
the products of the farm and the rents of real estate,
although imposed merely because of ownership and with no
possible means of escape from payment, as belonging to a

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Opinion of the Court.

totally different class from that which includes the property
from whence the income proceeds?
There can be but one answer, unless the constitutional
restriction is to be treated as utterly illusory and futile, and
the object of its framers defeated. We find it impossible to
hold that a fundamental requisition, deemed so important as
to be enforced by two provisions, one affirmative and one
negative, can be refined away by forced distinctions between
that which gives value to property, and the property itself.
Nor can we perceive any ground why the same reasoning
does not apply to capital in personalty held for the purpose
of income or ordinarily yielding income, and to the income
therefrom. All the real estate of the country, and all its
invested personal property, are open to the direct operation
of the taxing power if an apportionment be made according
to the Constitution. The Constitution does not say that no
direct tax shall be laid by apportionment on any other property than land; on the contrary, it forbids all unapportioned
direct taxes; and we know of no warrant for excepting personal property from the exercise of the power, or any reason
why an apportioned direct tax cannot be laid and assessed, as
Mr. Gallatin said in his report when Secretary of the Treasury
in 1812, "upon the same objects of taxation on which the
direct taxes levied under the authority of the State are laid
and assessed."
Personal property of some kind is of general distribution;
and so are incomes, though the taxable range thereof might
be narrowed through large exemptions.
The Congress of the Confederation found the limitation of
the sources of the contributions of the States to "land, and
the buildings and improvements thereon," by the eighth
article of July 9, 1778, so objectionable that the article was
amended April 28, 1783, so that the taxation should be
apportioned in proportion to the whole number of white
and other free citizens and inhabitants, including those bound
to servitude for a term of years and three-fifths of all other
persons, except Indians not paying taxes; and Madison, Ellsworth, and Hamilton in their address, in sending the amend-

ment to the States, said: '. Tlis rule, although not free from
objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be
devised." 1 Ell. Deb. 93, 95, 98.
Nor are we impressed with the contention that, because in
the four instances in which the power of direct taxation has
been exercised, Congress did not see fit, for reasons of expediency, to levy a tax upon personalty, this amounts to such a
practical construction of the Constitution that the power did
not exist, that we must regard ourselves bound by it. We
should regret to be compelled to hold the powers of the
general government thus restricted, and certainly cannot
accede to the idea that the Constitution has become weakened
by a particular course of inaction under it.
The stress of the argument is thrown, however, on the
assertion that an income tax is not a property tax at all; that
it is not a real. estate tax, or a crop tax, or a bond tax; that it
is an assessment upon the taxpayer on account of his money:spending power as shown by his revenue for the year preceding the assessment; that rents received, crops harvested,
interest collected, have lost all connection with their origin,
,and although once not taxable have become transmuted in
their new form into taxable subject matter; in other words,
that income is taxable irrespective of the source from whence
it is derived.
This was the view entertained by Mr. Pitt, as expressed in
his celebrated speech on introducing his income tax law of
1799, and he did not hesitate to carry it to its logical conclu.sion. The English loan acts provided that the public dividends should be paid "free of all taxes and charges whatsoever;" but Mr. Pitt successfully contended that the dividends
for the purposes of the income tax were to be considered
simply in relation to the recipient as so much income, and
that the fund holder had no reason to complain. And this,
said Mr. Gladstone, fifty-five years after, was the rational
construction of the pledge. Financial Statements, 32.
The dissenting justices proceeded in effect upon this ground
in Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, but the court rejected it.
That was a state tax, it is true; but the States have power to

constitutional safeguards might be easily eluded.

law operates on the receipts from municipal bonds, it cannot
be sustained, because it is a tax on the power of the States,
and on their instrumentalities to borrow money, and consequently repugnant to the Constitution. But if, as contended,
the interest when received has become merely money in the
recipient's pocket, and taxable as such without reference to
the source from which it came, the question is immaterial
whether it could have been originally taxed at all or not.
This was admitted by the Attorney General with characteristic candor.; and it follows that, if the revenue derived from
municipal bonds cannot be taxed because the source cannot
be, the same rule applies to revenue from any other source
not subject to the tax; and the lack of power to levy any but
an apportioned tax on real and personal property equally
exists as to the revenue therefrom.
Admitting that this act taxes the income of property irrespective of its source, still we cannot doubt that such a tax is
necessarily a direct tax in the meaning of the Constitution.
In England, we do not understand that an income tax has
ever been regarded as other than a direct tax. In Dowell's
History of Taxation and Taxes in England, admitted to be the
leading authority, the evolution of taxation in that country is
given, and an income tax is invariably classified as a direct
tax. 3 Dowell, (1884,) 103, 126. The author refers to the
grant of a fifteenth and tenth and a graduated income tax in
1435, and to many subsequent comparatively ancient statutes
as income tax laws. 1 Dowell, 121. It is objected that the
taxes imposed by these acts were not, scientifically speaking,
income taxes at all, and that although there was a partial
income tax in 1758, there was no general income tax until
Pitt's of 1799. Nevertheless, the income taxes levied by
these modern acts, Pitt's, Addington's, Petty's, Peel's, and
by existing laws, are all classified as direct taxes; and, so far
as the income tax we are considering is concerned, that view
is concurred in by the cyclopoedists, the lexicographers, and

the political economists, and generally by the classification of
European governments wherever an income tax obtains.
In Attorney General v. Queen Insurance Co., 3 App. Cas.
1090, which arose under the British North America act of
1867, (30 and 31 Viot. c. 3, § 92,) which provided that the
provincial legislatures could only raise revenue for provincial
purposes within each province, (in addition to licenses,) by
direct taxation, an act of the Quebec legislature laying a
stamp duty came under consideration, and the judicial committee of the Privy Council, speaking by Jessel, M. R., held
that the words "direct taxation" had "either a technical
meaning, or a general, or, as it is sometimes called, a popular
meaning. One or the other meaning the words must have;
and in trying to find out their meaning we must have recourse
to the usual sources of information, whether regarded as technical words, words of art, or words used in popular language."
And considering "their meaning either as words used in the
sense of political economy, or as words used in jurisprudence
of the courts of law," it was concluded that stamps were not
included in the category of direct taxation, and that the imposition was not warranted.
In Attorney General v. Reed, 10 App. Cas. 141, 144, Lord
Chancellor Selbourne said, in relation to the same act of Parliament: "The question.whether it is a direct or an indirect
tax cannot depend upon those special events which may vary
in particular cases; but the best general rule is to look to the
time of payment; and if at the time the ultimate incidence is
uncertain, then, as it appears to their lordships, it cannot, in
this view, be called direct taxation within the meaning of the
second section of the ninety-second clause of the act in question."
In Bank qf Toronto v. Lambe, 12 App. Cas. 575, 582, the
Privy Council, discussing the same subject, in dealing with
the argument much pressed at the bar, that a tax to be strictly
direct must be general, said that they had no hesitation in
rejecting it for legal purposes. "It would deny the character
of a direct tax to the income tax of this country, which is
always spoken of as such, and is generally looked upon as a

direct tax of the most obvious kind ; and it would run counter
to the common understanding of men on this subject, which is
one main clue to the meaning of the legislature."
At the time the Constitution was framed and adopted, under
the systems of direct taxation of many of the States, taxes were
laid on incomes from professions, business, or employments,
as well as from " offices and places of profit;" but if it were
the fact that there had then been no income tax law, such as
this, it would not be of controlling importance. A direct tax
cannot be taken out of the constitutional rule because the
particular tax did not exist at the time the rule was prescribed.
As Chief Justice Marshall said in the Darlmouth College case:
"It is not enough to say, that this particular case was not
in the mind of the convention, when the article was framed,
nor of the American people, when it was adopted. It is necessary to go further, and to say that, had this particular case
been suggested, the language would have been so varied, as to exclude it, or it would have been made a special exception. The
case being within the words of the rule, must be within its operation likewise, unless there be something in the literal construction so obviously absurd, or mischievous, or repugnant to the
general spirit of the instrument, as to justify those who expound
the Constitution in making it an exception." 4 Wheat. 518, 644.
Being direct, and therefore to be laid by apportionment, is
there any real difficulty in doing so? Cannot Congress, if
the necessity exist of raising thirty, forty, or any other number of million dollars for the support of the government, in
addition to the revenue from duties, imposts, and excises, apportion the quota of each State upon the basis of the census,
and thus advise it of the payment which must be made, and
proceed to assess that amount on all the real and personal property and the income of all persons in the State, and collect the
same if the State does not in the meantime assume and pay its
quota and collect the amount according to its own system and in
its own way? Cannot Congress do this, as respects either or all
these subjects of taxation, and deal with each in such manner
as might be deemed expedient, as indeed was done in the act
of July 14, 1798, c.75, 1 Stat. 597 ? Inconveniences might pos-

:sibly attend the levy of an income tax, notwithstanding the
listing of receipts, when adjusted, furnishes its own valuation
but that it is apportionable is hardly denied, although it is asserted that it would operate so unequally as to be undesirable.
In the disposition of the inquiry whether a general unapportioned tax on the income of real and personal property can
be sustained, under the Constitution, it is apparent that the
suggestion that the result of compliance with the fundamental
law would lead to the abandonment of that method of taxation altogether, because of inequalities alleged to necessarily
accompany its pursuit, could not be allowed to influence the
conclusion; but the suggestion not unnaturally invites attention to the contention of appellants' counsel, that the want of
uniformity and equality in this act is such as to invalidate it.
Figures drawn from the census are given, showing that enormous assets of mutual insurance companies; of building associations; of mutual savings banks; large productive property
of ecclesiastical organizations; are exempted, and it is claimed
that the exemptions reach so many hundred millions that the
rate of taxation would perhaps have been reduced one-half, if
they had not been made. We are not dealing with the act
from that point of view; but, assuming the data to be substantially reliable, if the sun desired to be raised had been
apportioned, it may be doubted whether any State, which paid
its quota and collected the amount by its own methods, would,
or could under its constitution, have allowed a large part of
the property alluded to to escape taxation. If so, a better
measure of equality would have been attained than would be
otherwise possible, since, according to the argument for the
government, the rule of equality is not prescribed by the
Constitution as to Federal taxation, and the observance of
such a rule as inherent in all just taxation is purely a matter
of legislative discretion.
Elaborate argument is made as to the efficacy and merits of
an income tax in general, as on the one hand, equal and just,
and on the other, elastic and certain ; not that it is not open
to abuse by such deductions and exemptions as might make
taxation under it so wanting in uniformity and equality as in

substance to amount to deprivation of property without due
process of law ; not that it is not open to fraud and evasion and
is inquisitorial in its methods; but because it is preeminently
a tax upon the rich, and enables the burden of taxes on consumption and of duties on imports to be sensibly diminished.
And it is said that the United States as "the representative
of an indivisible nationality, as a political sovereign equal in
authority to any other on the face of the globe, adequate to
all emergencies, foreign or domestic, and having at its command for offence and defence and for all governmental purposes all the resources of the nation," would be "but a maimed
and crippled creation after all," unless it possesses the power
to lay a tax on the income of real and personal property
throughout the United States without apportionment.
The power to tax real and personal property and the income from both, there being an apportionment, is conceded;
that such a tax is a direct tax in the meaning of the Constitution has not been, and, in our judgment, cannot be successfully
denied ; and yet we are thus invited to hesitate in the enforcement of the mandate of the Constitution, which prohibits Congress from laying a direct tax on the revenue from property
of the citizen without regard to state lines, and in such manner that the States cannot intervene by payment in regulation
of their own resources, lest a government of delegated powers
should be found to be, not less powerful, but less absolute,
than the imagination of the advocate had supposed.
We are not here concerned with the question whether an income tax be or be not desirable, nor whether such a tax would
enable the government to diminish taxes on consumption and
duties on imports, and to enter upon what may be believed to
be a reform of its fiscal and commercial system. Questions of
that character belong to the controversies of political parties,
and cannot be settled by judicial decision. In these cases our
province is to determine whether this income tax on the revenue from property does or does not belong to the class of
direct taxes. If it does, it is, being unapportioned, in violation
of the Constitution, and we must so declare.
Differences have often occurred in this court -differences

exist now - but there has never been a time in its history
when there has been a difference of opinion as to its duty to
announce its deliberate conclusions unaffected by considerations not pertaining to the case in hand.
If it be true that the Constitution should have been so framed
that a tax of this kind could be laid, the instrument defines
the way for its amendment. In no part of it was greater
sagacity displayed. Except that no State, without its consent,
can be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate, the Constitution may be amended upon the concurrence of two-thirds of
both houses, and the ratification of the legislatures or conventions of the several States, or through a Federal convention,
when applied for by the legislatures of two-thirds of the
States, and upon like ratification. The ultimate sovereignty
may be thus called into play by a slow and deliberate process,. which gives time for mere hypothesis and opinion to,
exhaust themselves, and for the sober second thought of every
part of the country to be asserted.
We have considered the act only in respect of the tax on,

property, and have not commented on so much of it as bears.
on gains or profits from business, privileges, or employments,
in view of the instances in which taxation on business, privileges, or employments has assumed the guise of an excise tax
and been sustained as such.
Being of opinion that so much of the sections of this law as
lays a tax on income from real and personal property is
invalid, we are brought to the question of the effect of that
conclusion upon these sections as a whole.
It is elementary that the same statute may be in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional, and if the parts are
wholly independent of each other, that which is constitutional
may stand while that which is unconstitutional will be rejected. And in the case before us there is no question as to
the validity of this act, except sections twenty-seven to thirtyseven, inclusive, which relate to the subject which has been
under discussion; and as to them we think the rule laid down
by Chief Justice Shaw in Warren v. Chlarlestown, 2 Gray, 84, is

applicable, that if the different parts "are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other, as conditions,
considerations or compensations for each other, as to warrant
a belief that the legislature intended them as a whole, and
that, if all could not be carried into effect, the legislature
would not pass the residue independently, and some parts are
unconstitutional, all the provisions which are thus dependent,
conditional or connected, must fall with them." Or, as the point
is put by Mr. Justice Matthews in Poindexter v. Greenhow,
114 U. S. 270, 304: "It is undoubtedly true that there may be
cases where one part of a statute may be enforced as constitutional, and another be declared inoperative and void, because
unconstitutional; but these are cases where the parts are so
distinctly separable that each can stand alone, and where the
court is able to see, and to declare, that the intention of the
legislature was that the part pronounced valid should be
enforceable, even though the other part should fail. To hold
otherwise would be to substitute, for the law intended by the
legislature, one they may never have been willing by itself
to enact." And again, as stated by the same eminent judge
in 8raigue v. Thompson, 118 U. S. 90, 95, where it was
urged that certain illegal exceptions in a section of a statute
might be disregarded, but that the rest could stand: "The
insuperable difficulty with the application of that principle of
construction to the present instance is, that by rejecting the
exceptions intended by the legislature of Georgia the statute
is made to enact what confessedly the legislature never meant.
It confers upon the statute a positive operation beyond the
legislative intent, and beyond what any one can say it would
have enacted in view of the illegality of the exceptions."
According to the census, the true valuation of real and personal property in the United States in 1890 was $65,037,091,197, of which real estate with improvements thereon made up
$39,544,544,333. Of course, from the latter must be deducted,
in applying these sections, all unproductive property and all
property whose net yield does not exceed four thousand dollars;
but, even with such deductions, it is evident that the income
from realty formed a vital part of the scheme for taxation em-

bodied therein. If that be stricken out, and also the income from
all invested personal property, bonds, stocks, investments of all
kinds, it is obvious that by far the largest part of the anticipated revenue would be eliminated, and this would leave the
burden of the tax to be borne by professions, trades, employments, or vocations; and in that way what was intended as a
tax on capital would remain in substance a tax on occupations
and labor. We cannot believe that such was the intention of
Congress. We do not mean to say that an act laying by
apportionment a direct tax on all real estate and personal
property, or the income thereof, might not also lay excise
taxes on business, privileges, employments, and vocations.
But this is not such an act; and the scheme must be considered as a whole. Being invalid as to the greater part, and
falling, as the tax would, if any part were held valid, in a
direction which could not have been contemplated except in
connection with the taxation considered as an entirety, we
are constrained to conclude that sections twenty-seven to
thirty-seven, inclusive, of the act, which became a law without
the signature of the President on August 28, 1894, are wholly
inoperative and void.
Our conclusions may, therefore, be summed up as follows:
First. We adhere to the opinion already announced, that,
taxes on real estate being indisputably direct taxes, taxes on
the rents or income of real estate are equally direct taxes.
Second. We are of opinion that taxes on personal property,
or on the income of personal property, are likewise direct
taxes.
Third. The tax imposed by sections twenty-seven to thirtyseven, inclusive, of the act of 1894, so far as it falls on the
income of real estate and of personal property, being a direct
tax within the meaning of the Constitution, and, therefore,
unconstitutional and void because not apportioned according
to representation, all those sections, constituting one entire
scheme of taxation, are necessarily invalid.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN

dissenting.

At the former hearing of these causes it was adjudged that,
within the meaning of the Constitution, a duty on incomes
arising from rents was a direct tax on the lands from which
such rents were derived, and, therefore, must be apportioned
among the several States on the basis of population, and not
by the rule of uniformity thoroughout the United States, as
prescribed in the case -of duties, imposts, and excises. And
the court, eight of its members being present, was equally
divided upon the question whether all the other provisions of
the statute relating to incomes would fall in consequence of
that judgment.
It is appropriate now to say that however objectionable the
law would have been, after the provision for taxing incomes
arising from rents was stricken out, I did not then, nor do I
now, think it within the province of the court to annul the
provisions relating to incomes derived from other specified
sources, and take from the government the entire revenue
contemplated to be raised by the taxation of incomes, simply
because the clause relating to rents was held to be unconstitutional. The reasons for this view will be stated in another
connection.
From the judgment heretofore rendered I dissented, announcing my entire concurrence in the views expressed by Mr.
Justice White in his very able opinion. I stated at that time
some general conclusions reached by me upon the several
questions covered by the opinion of the majority.
In dissenting from the opinion and judgment of the court
.on the present application for a rehearing, I alluded to particular questions discussed by the majority, and stated that in a
dissenting opinion to be subsequently filed I would express
my views more fully than I could then do as to what, within
the meaning of the Constitution, and looking at the practice of
the government, as well as the decisions of this court, was a
"direct" tax to be levied only by apportioning it among the
States according to their respective numbers.

Wilson Tariff act, and entitled "An act to reduce taxation, to
provide revenue for the government, and for other purposes,"
it was provided: "That from and after the first day of January eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and until the first day
of January nineteen hundred, there shall be assessed, levied,
collected, and paid annually upon the gains, profits, and income
received in the preceding calendar year by every citizen of the
United States, whether residing at home or abroad, and every
person residing therein, whether said gains, profits, or income
be derived from any kind of property, rents, interest, dividends,
or salaries, or from any profession, trade, employment, or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, or from any
other source whatever, a tax of two per centum on the amount
so derived over and above four thousand dollars, and a like
tax shall be levied, collected, and paid annually upon the gains,
profits, and income from all property owned and of every
business, trade, or profession carried on in the United States
by persons residing without the United States."
Section 28 declares what shall be included and what excluded in estimating the gains, profits, and income of any
person.
The Constitution declares that "the Congress shall have
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to
pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and
excises shall be uniform throughout the United States." Art. I,
See. S.
The only other clauses in the Constitution, at the time of its
adoption, relating to taxation by the general government,
were the following:
"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned
among the several States which may be included within this
Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be
determined by adding to the whole number of free persons,
including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.
The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after
the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and

within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as
they shall by law direct." Art. I, Sec. 2.
"No capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in
proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed
to be taken." Art. I, Sec. 9.
"No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from
any State." Art. I, Sec. 9.
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that "representatives
shall be apportioned among the several States according to
their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed."
It thus appears that the primary object of all taxation by
the general government is to pay the debts and provide for
the common defence and general welfare of the United States,
and that with the exception of the inhibition upon taxes or
duties on articles exported from the States, no restriction is in
terms imposed upon national taxation, except that direct taxes
must be apportioned among the several States on the basis of
numbers, (excluding Indians not taxed,) while duties, imposts
and excises must be uniform throughout the United States.
What are "direct taxes" within the meaning of the Constitution ? In the convention of 1787, Rufus King asked what
was the precise meaning of direct taxation, and no one answered.
Madison Papers, 5 Elliott's Debates, 451. The debates of that
famous body do not show that -any delegate attempted to give
a clear, succinct definition of what, in his opinion, was a direct
tax. Indeed, the report of those debates, upon the question
now before us, is very meagre and unsatisfactory. An illustration of this is found in the case of Gouverneur Morris. It
is stated that on the 12th of July, 1787, he moved to add to a
clause empowering Congress to vary representation according
to the principles of "wealth and numbers of inhabitants," a
proviso " that taxation shall be in proportion to representation." And he is reported to have remarked, on that occasion, that while some objections lay against his motion, be
supposed "they would be removed by restraining the rule to direct taxation." 5 Elliott's Debates, 302. But, on the 8th of
August, 1787, the work of the Committee on Detail being before

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO,.

641

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

the convention, Mr. Morris is reported to have remarked,
"let it not be said that direct taxation is to be proportioned
to representation." 5 Elliott's Debates, 393.
If the question propounded by Rufus King had been answered in accordance with the interpretation now given, it is
not at all certain that the Constitution, in its present form,
wrould have been adopted by the convention, nor, if adopted,
that it would have been accepted by the requisite number of
States.
A question so difficult to be answered by able statesmen
and lawyers directly concerned in the organization of the
present government, can now, it seems, be easily answered,
after a reexamination of documents, writings, and treatises on
political economy, all of which, without any exception worth
noting, have been several times directly brought to the attention
of this court. And whenever that has been done the result always, until now, has been that a duty on incomes, derived from
taxable subjects, of whatever nature, was held not to be a direct
tax within the meaning of the Constitution, to be apportioned
among the States on the basis of population, but could be laid,
according to the rule of uniformity, upon individual citizens,
corporations, and associations without reference to numbers in
the particular States in which such citizens, corporations, or
associations were domiciled. Hamilton, referring to the distinction between direct and indirect taxes, said it was "a matter
of regret that terms so uncertain and vague in so important a
point are to be found in the Constitution," and that it would
be vain to seek "for any antecedent settled legal meaning to the
respective terms." 7 Hamilton's Works, (orig. ed.,) 845.
This court is again urged to consider this question in the
light of the theories advanced by political economists. But
Chief Justice Chase, delivering the judgment of this court in
Veazie -Bankc v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 542, observed that the
enumeration of the different kinds of taxes that Congress was
authorized to impose was probably made with very little reference to the speculations of political economists, and that there
was nothing in the great work of Adam Smith, published
shortly before the meeting of the convention of 1787, that

gave any light on the meaning of the words "direct taxes" in
the Constitution.
From the very necessity of the case, therefore, we are compelled to look at the practice of the government after the
adoption of the Constitution as well as to the course of judicial
decision.
By an act of Congress, passed June 5, 1794, c. 45, 1 Stat.
373, specified duties were laid "upon all carriages for the conveyance of persons," that should be kept by or for any person
for his use, or to be let out to hire, or for the conveying of
passengers. The case of Ilylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171,
decided in 1796, distinctly presented the question whether the
duties laid upon carriages by that act was a direct tax within
the meaning of the Constitution. If it was a tax of that character, it was conceded that the statute was unconstitutional,
for the reason that the duties imposed by it were not apportioned among the States on the basis of numbers. As the
case involved an important constitutional question, each of the
Justices who heard the argument delivered a separate opinion.
Chief Justice Ellsworth was sworn into office on the day the
decision was announced, but, not having heard the whole of the
argument, declined to take any part in the judgment. It can
scarcely be doubted that he approved the decision; for, while
a Senator in Congress from Connecticut, he voted more than
once for a bill laying duties on carriages, and, with Rufus
King, Robert Morris, and other distinguished statesmen, voted
in the Senate for the act of June 5, 1794. Annals of Congress,
3d Sess., 1793-5, pp. 120, 849.
It is well to see what the Justices who delivered opinions in
the Hlylton case said as to the meaning of the words "direct
taxes" in the Constitution.
Mr. Justice Chase said: "As it was incumbent on the
plaintiff's counsel in error, so they took great pains to prove
that the tax on carriages was a direct tax; but they did not
satisfy my mind. I think at least it may be doubted, and if
I only doubted I should affirm the judgment of the Circuit
Court. The deliberate decision of the national legislature
(who did not consider a tax on carriages a direct tax, but

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

643

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

thought it was within the description of a duty) would determine me, if the case was doubtful, to receive the construction
of the legislature. But I am inclined to think that a tax on
carriages is not a direct tax, within the letter or meaning of
the Constitution. The great object of the Constitution was
to give Congress a power to lay taxes adequate to the exigencies of government; but they were to observe two rules in
imposing them, namely, the rule of uniformity, when they
laid duties, imposts, or excises, and the rule of apportionment according to the census, when they laid any direct tax."
"The Constitution evidently contemplated no taxes as direct
taxes, but only such as Congress could lay in proportion to the
census. The rule of apportionment is only to be adopted in
such cases where it can reasonably apply; and the subject
taxed must ever determine the application of the rule. If it
is proposed to tax any specific article by the rule of apportionment, and it would evidently create great inequality
and injustice, it is unreasonable to say that the Constitution
intended such tax should be laid by that rule. It appears to
me that a tax on carriages cannot be laid by the rule of
apportionment without very great inequality and injustice.
For example, suppose two States, equal in census, to pay
$80,000 each, by a tax on carriages of eight dollars on every
carriage; and in one State there are 100 carriages and in the
other 1000. The owners of carriages in one State would pay
ten times the tax of owners in the other. A in one State
would pay for his carriage eight dollars, but B, in the other
State, would pay for his carriage eighty dollars." "I think
an annual tax on carriages for the conveyance of persons may
be considered as within the power granted to Congress to lay
duties. The term duty is the most comprehensive next to
the general term tax, and practically in Great Britain (whence
we take our general ideas of taxes, duties, imposts, excises,
customs, etc.) embraces taxes on stamps, tolls for passage, etc.,
and is not confined to taxes on importation only." "I am
inclined to think, but of this I do not give a judicial opinion,
that the direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution are
only two, to wit, a capitation or poll tax, simply, without

regard to property, profession, or any other circumstance,
and a tax on land. I doubt whether a tax, by a general
assessment of personal property within the United States
is included within the term 'direct tax.'"
Mr. Justice Paterson: "What is the natural and common
or technical and appropriate meaning of the words 'duty' and
' excise,' it is not easy to ascertain. They present no clear and
precise idea to the mind. Different persons will annex different significations to the terms. It was, however, obviously
the intention of the framers of the Constitution that Congress
should possess full power over every species of taxable property, except exports. The term 'taxes' is generical, and was
made use of to vest in Congress plenary authority in all cases
of taxation. The general division of taxes is into direct and
indirect. Although the latter term is not to be found in the
Constitution, yet the former necessarily implies it. Indirect
stands opposed to direct. There may, perhaps, be an indirect
tax on a particular article, that cannot be comprehended
within the description of duties, or imposts, or excises; in
such case it will be comprised under the general denomination of taxes; for the term 'tax' is the genu8, and includes: 1.
Direct taxes. 2. Duties, imposts, and excises. 3. All other
classes of an indirect kind, and not within any of the classifications enumerated under the preceding heads. The question occurs, how is such tax to be laid, uniformly or apportionately? The rule of uniformity will apply, because it is
an indirect tax, and direct taxes only are to be apportioned.
What are direct taxes within the meaning of the Constitution? The Constitution declares that a capitation tax is a
direct tax, and, both in theory and practice, a tax on land is
deemed to be a direct tax. In this way the terms direct taxes
and capitation and other direct tax are satisfied." "I never
entertained a doubt that the principal, I will not say the only,
objects that the framers of the Constitution contemplated as
falling within the rule of apportionment were a capitation tax
and a tax on land. Local considerations and the particular
circumstances and relative situation of the States naturally
lead to this view of the subject. The provision was made

in favor of the Southern States. They possessed a large
number of slaves; they had extensive tracts of territory,
thinly settled and not very productive. A majority of the
States had but few slaves, and several of them a limited
territory, well settled, and in a high state of cultivation.
The Southern States, if no provision had been introduced in
the Constitution, would have been wholly at the mercy of the
other States. Congress, in such case, might tax slaves, at
discretion or arbitrarily, and land in every part of the Union
after the same rate or measure: so much a head in the first
instance, and so much an acre in the second. To guard them
against imposition in these particulars was the reason of
introducing the clause in the Constitution, which directs that
representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among
the States according to their respective numbers. On the
part of the plaintiff in error it has been contended that the
rule of apportionment is to be favored rather than the rule of
uniformity, and, of course, that the instrument is to receive
such a construction as will extend the former and restrict the
latter. I am not of that opinion. The Constitution has been
considered as an accommodating system; it was the effect of
mutual sacrifices and concessions; it was the work of compromise. The rule of apportionment is of this nature; it is
radically wrong; it cannot be supported by any solid reasoning. Why should slaves, who are a species of property, be
represented more than any other property? The rule, therefore, ought not to be extended by construction.
Again,
numbers do not afford a just estimate or rule of wealth. It
is, indeed, a very uncertain and incompetent sign of opulence."
"If a tax upon land, where the object is simple and uniform
throughout the States, is scarcely practicable, what shall we
say of a tax attempted to be apportioned among, and raised
and collected from, a number of dissimilar objects? The
difficulty will increase with the number and variety of the
things proposed for taxation. We shall be obliged to resort
to intricate and endless valuations and assessments, in which
everything will be arbitrary and nothing certain. There will
be no rule to walk by. The rule of uniformity, on the con-

trary, implies certainty, and leaves nothing to the will and
pleasure of the assessor. In such case, the object and the
sum coincide, the rule and thing unite, and of course there
can be no imposition. The truth is, that the articles taxed in
one State should be taxed in another; in this way the spirit
of jealousy is appeased, and tranquillity preserved; in this
way the pressure on industry will be equal in the several
States, and the relation between the different objects of taxation duly preserved.
Apportionment is an operation on
States, and involves valuations and assessments, which are
arbitrary, and should not be resorted to but in case of necessity. Uniformity is an instant operation on individuals, without the intervention of assessments, or any regard to States,
and is at once easy, certain, and efficacious. All taxes on
expenses or consumption are indirect taxes."
Mr. Justice Iredell: "1. All direct taxes must be apportioned. 2. All duties, imposts, and excises must be uniform.
If the carriage tax be a direct tax, within the meaning of the
Constitution, it must be apportioned. If it be a duty, impost,
or excise, within the meaning of the Constitution, it must be
uniform. If it can be considered as a tax, neither direct
within the meaning of the Constitution, nor comprehended
within the term 'duty, impost, or excise' there is no provision
in the Constitution, one way or another, and then it must be
left to such an operation of the power, as if the authority to
lay taxes had been given generally in all instances, without
saying whether they should be apportioned or uniform; and
in that case I should presume the tax ought to be uniform,
because the present Constitution was particularly intended to
affect individuals, and not States, except in particular cases
specified; and this is the leading distinction between the
articles of Confederation and the present Constitution. As
all direct taxes must be apportioned, it is evident that the
Constitution contemplated none as direct but such as could be
apportioned. If this cannot be apportioned, it is, therefore,
not a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution. That this
tax cannot be apportioned is evident." "Such an arbitrary
method of taxing different States differently is a suggestion

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

altogether new, and would lead, if practised, to such dangerous consequences, that it will require very powerful arguments
to show that that method of taxing would be in any manner
compatible with the Constitution, with which at present I
deem it utterly irreconcilable, it being altogether destructive
of the notion of a common interest, upon which the very
principles of the Constitution are founded, so far as the condition of the United States will admit." "Some difficulties
may occur which we do not at present foresee. Perhaps a
direct tax in the sense of the Constitution can mean nothing
but a tax on something inseparably annexed to the soil; something capable of apportionment under all such circumstances."
"It is sufficient, on the present occasion, for the court to be
satisfied that this is not a direct tax contemplated by the
Constitution, in order to affirm the present judgment; since,
if it cannot be apportioned, it must necessarily be uniform.
I am clearly of opinion this is not a direct tax in the sense of
the Constitution, and, therefore, that the judgment ought to
be affirmed."
Mr. Justice Wilson: "As there were only four judges, including myself, who attended the argument of this cause, I
should have thought it proper to join in the decision, though
I had before expressed a judicial opinion on the subject, in the
Circuit Court of Virginia, did not the unanimity of the other
three judges relieve me from the necessity. I shall now, however, only add, that my sentiments, in favor of the constitutionality of the tax in question, have not been changed."
The scope of the decision in the Ilylton case will appear
from what this court has said in later cases to which I will
hereafter refer.
It is appropriate to observe, in this connection, that the
importance of the Hylton case was not overlooked by the
statesmen of that day. It was argued by eminent lawyers,
and we may well assume that nothing was left unsaid that
was necessary to a full understanding of the question involved.
Edmund Pendleton, of Virginia, concurring with Madison
that a tax on carriages was a direct tax, within the meaning of the Constitution, prepared a paper on the subject, and

enclosed it to Mr. Giles, then a Senator from Virginia. Under
date of February 7, 1796, Madison wrote to Pendleton: "I
read with real pleasure the paper you put into the hands of
Mr. Giles, which is unquestionably a most simple and lucid
view of the subject, and well deserving the attention of the
court which is to determine on it. The paper will be printed
in the newspapers, in tigne for the judges to have the beneft of
it. I did not find that it needed any of those corrections
which you so liberally committed to my hand. It has been
thought unnecessary to prefix your name; but Mr. Giles will
let an intimation appear, along with the remarks, that they
proceedfrom a quarter that claims attention to them.
There never was a question on which my mind was more satisfied, and yet I have very little expectation that it will be
viewed by the court in the same light it is by me." 2 Madison's Writings, 77. And on March 6, 1796, two days before
the HJlton case was decided, Madison wrote to Jefferson:
"The court has not given judgment yet on the carriage tax.
It is said the Judges will be unanimous for its constitutionality." 2 Madison's Writings, 87. Mr. Justice Iredell, in his
Diary, said: "At this term Oliver Ellsworth took his seat as
Chief Justice. The first case that came up was that of Hylton
v. The United States. This was a very important cause, as it
involved a question of constitutional law. The point was the
constitutionality of the law of Congress of 1794, laying duties
upon carriages. If a direct tax, it could only be laid in proportion to the census, which has not as yet been taken.
The counsel of Hylton, Campbell and Ingersoll, contended
that the tax was a direct tax, and were opposed by Lee
and Hamilton. The court iitnanimnously agreed that the tax
was constitutional, and delivered their opinions 'seriatim.'"
Again: "The day before yesterday Mr. Hamilton spoke in
our court, attended by the most crowded audience I ever saw
there, both Houses of Congress being almost deserted on the
occasion. Though he was in very ill health, he spoke with
astonishing ability and in a most pleasing manner, and was
listened to with the profoundest attention. His speech lasted
about three hours. It was on the question whether the car-

riage tax, as laid, was a constitutional one." 2 McRee's Life
of Iredell, 459, 461.
Turning now to the acts of Congress passed after the decision in the Ilylton case, we find that by the acts of July 14,
1798, c. 75, 1 Stat. 597; August 2, 1813, c. 37, 3 Stat. 53;
January 9, 1815, c. 21, 3 Stat. 164; and March 5, 1816, c. 24,
3 Stat. 255, direct taxes were assessed upon lands, improvemerts, dwelling-houses, and slaves, and apportioned among the
several States. And by the act of August 5, 1861, c. 45, 12
Stat. 294, 297, entitled "An act to provide increased revenues
from imports, to pay interest on the debt, and for other purposes," a direct tax was assessed and apportioned among the
States on lands, improvements, and dwelling-houses only.
Instances of duties upon tangible personal property are
found in the act of January 18, 1815, c. 22, 3 Stat. 180, imposing duties upon certain goods, wares, and merchandise, manufactured or made for sale within the United States or the
Territories thereof, namely, upon pig iron, castings of iron, bar
iron, rolled or slit iron, nails, brads or sprigs, candles of white
wax, mould candles of tallow, hats, caps, umbrellas and parasols, paper, playing and visiting cards, saddles, bridles, books,
beer, ale, porter, and tobacco ; and also in the act of January
18, 1815, c. 23, 3 Stat. 186, which laid a duty graduated by
value upon "all household furniture kept for use," and upon
gold and silver watches.
It may be observed, in passing, that the above statutes, with
one exception, were all enacted during the administration of
President Madison, and were approved by him.
Instances of duties upon intangible personal property are
afforded by the Stamp Act of July 6, 1797, c. 11, 1 Stat. 527,
which, among other things, levied stamp duties upon bonds,
notes, and certificates of stock. Similar duties had been made
familiar to the American people by the British Stamp Act of
1765, 5 Geo. 3, c. 12, 26 Pickering's Statutes at Large, 179,
and were understood by the delegates to the Convention of
1787 to be included among the duties mentioned in the Constitution. 1 Elliott's Deb. 368 ; 5 Id. 432.

subjects of direct taxation is thus explained by this court in
Veazie Bank v. Fenno, above cited: "As persons, slaves were
proper subjects of a capitation tax, which is described in the
Constitution as a direct tax; as property they were, by the laws
of some, if not most of the States, classed as real property,
descendible to heirs. Under the first view, they would be
subject to the tax of 1798, as a capitation tax; under the
latter, they would be subject to the taxation of the other years
as realty. That the latter view was that taken by the framers of the acts after 1798, becomes highly probable, when it is
considered that in the States where slaves were held, much of
the value which would otherwise have attached to land passed
into the slaves. If, indeed, the land only had been valued without the slaves, the land would have been subject to much heavier
proportional imposition in those States than in States where
there were no slaves; for the proportion of tax imposed on
each State was determined by population, without reference
to the subjects on which it was to be assessed. The fact, then,
that slaves were valued, under the act referred to, far from
showing, as some have supposed, that Congress regarded personal property as a proper object of direct taxation under the
Constitution, shows only that Congress, after 1798, regarded
slaves, for the purpose of taxation, as realty." 8 Wall. 543.
Recurring to the course of legislation it will be found that,
by the above act of August 5, 1861, c. 45, Congress not only laid
and apportioned among the States a direct tax of $20,000,000
upon lands, improvements, and dwelling-houses, but it provided that there should be "levied, collected, and paid upon
the annual income of every person residing in the United
States, whether such income is derived from any kind of
property, or from any profession, trade, employment, or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, orfrom any
source whatever, if such annual income exceeds the sum of
eight hundred dollars, a tax of three per centum on the amount
of such excess of each income above eight hundred dollars,"
etc. 12 Stat. 292, 309.
Subsequent statutes greatly extended the area of taxation.
By the act of July 1, 1862, c. 119, a duty was imposed on

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

651

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

the gross amount of all receipts for the transportation of
passengers by railroads, steam vessels, and ferry boats; on
all dividends in scrip or money declared due or paid by banks,
trust companies, insurance companies, and upon "the annual
gains, profits, or income of every person residing in the United
States, whether derived from any kind of property, rents,

interest, dividends, salaries, or from any profession, trade,
employment, or vocation carried on in the United States or
elsewhere, or from any source whatever," etc.

12 Stat. 432,

473. The act of June 30, 1864, c. 173, as did the previous
act of 1862, imposed a duty on gains, profits, or income from
whatever kind of property or from whatever source derived,
including "rents." 13 Stat. 223, 281. The act of March 3,
1865, c. 78, increased the amount of such duty. 13 Stat. 479.
All subsequent acts of Congress retained the provision imposing a duty on income derived from rents and from every kind
of property. Act of March 10, 1866, c. 15, 14 Stat. 4, 5; act
of March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 477, 480; act of July
14, 1870, c. 255, 16 Stat. 256.
What has been the course of judicial decision touching the
clause of the Constitution that relates to direct taxes? And,
particularly, what, in the opinion of this court, was the scope
and effect of the decision in Hlylton v. United States?
In Pacific Ins. Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 446, the question
was presented whether the duty imposed by the act of June

30, 1864, as amended by that of July 13, 1866, on the dividends and undistributed sums, that is, on the incomes, from
whatever source, of insurance companies, was a direct tax
that could only be laid by apportionment among the States.
The point was distinctly made in argument that "an income
tax is, and always heretofore has been, regarded as being a
direct tax, as much so as a poll tax or a land tax. If it be a
direct tax, then the Constitution is imperative that it shall be
apportioned." Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the unanimous
judgment of this court, said "what are direct taxes was elaborately argued and considered by this court in Hlylton v. United
States, decided in the year 1796.

Story in their examination of the subject." "The taxing
power is given in the most comprehensive terms. The only
limitations imposed are: That direct taxes, including the
capitation tax, shall be apportioned; that duties, imposts,
and excises shall be uniform; and that no duties shall be
imposed upon articles exported from any State. With these
,exceptions the exercise of the power is, in all respects, unfettered. If a tax upon carriages, kept for his own use by the
owner, is not a direct tax, we can see no ground upon which
a tax upon the business of an insurance company can be held
to belong to that class of revenue charges." "The consequences which would follow the apportionment of the tax in
question among the States and Territories of the Union, in
the manner prescribed by the Constitution, must not be overlooked. They are very obvious. Where such corporations
are numerous and rich, it might be light; where none exist,
it could not be collected; where they are few and poor, it
would fall upon them with such weight as to involve annihilation. It cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution intended that any tax should be apportioned, the collection
of which on that principle would be attended with such results.
The consequences are fatal to the proposition. To the question under consideration it must be answered that the tax to
which it relates is not a direct tax, but a duty or excise; that
it was obligatory on the plaintiff to pay it."
In Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 543, 544, 546, the prin,cipal question was whether a tax on state bank notes issued
for circulation was a direct tax. On behalf of the bank it was
-contended by distinguished counsel that the tax was a direct
one, and that it was invalid because not apportioned among
-the States agreeably to the Constitution. In explanation of
the nature of direct taxes they relied largely (so the authorized report of the case states) on the writings of Adam Smith,
and on other treatises, English and American, on political economy. In the discussion of the case reference was made by
counsel to the former decisions in lylton v. United States,
and Pacifie Rs. 6"o. v. Soule. Chief Justice Chase, delivering the judgment of the court, after observing (as I have

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

653:

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

already stated) that the works of political economists gave
no valuable light on the question as to what, in the constiutional,sense, were direct taxes, entered upon an examination
of the numerous acts of Congress imposing taxes. That examination, he announced on behalf of this court, showed "thatpersonalproperty,contracts, occupations, and the like, have never
been regarded by Congress as proper subjects of direct tax."
"It may be rightly affirmed, therefore, that in the practical
construction of the Constitution by Congress direct taxes have
been limited to taxes on land and appurtenances, and taxes on
polls, or capitation taxes. And this construction is entitled
to groat consideration,- especially in the absence of anything
adverse to it in the discussions of the convention which
framed and of the conventions which ratified the Constitution." Referring to certain observations of Madison, King,.
and Ellsworth in the convention of 1787, he said: "All this,
doubtless shows uncertainty as to the true meaning of the
term 'direct tax' ; but it indicates, also, an understanding that
direct taxes were such as may be levied by capitation, and on
lands and appurtenances; or, perhaps, by valuation and assessment of personal property upon general lists. For these were,
the subjects from which the States at that time usually raised
their principal supplies. This view received the sanction of
this court two years before the enactment of the first law
imposing direct taxes eo nomine." The case last referred to,
was fylton v. United States. After a careful examination of
the opinions in that case, Chief Justice Chase proceeded: "It
may be safely assumed, therefore, as the unanimous judgment
of the court, [in the Hylton case] that a tax on carriages is,
not a direct tax. And it may further be taken as established
upon the testimony of Paterson, that the words ' direct taxes,' as
used in the Constitution, comprehended only capitation taxes,
and taxes on land, and perhaps taxes on personal property by
general valuation and assessment of the various descriptions
possessed within the several States. It follows necessarily
that the _power to tax without apportionment extends to all
other objects. Taxes on other objects are included under the
heads of taxes not direct, duties, imposts, and excises, and must

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

be laid and collected by the rule of uniformity. The tax under
consideration is a tax on bank circulation, and may very well
be classed under the head of duties. Certainly it is not, in the
sense of the Constitution, a direct tax. It may be said to
come within the same category of taxation as the tax on
incomes of insurance companies, which this court, at the last
term, in the case of Pacific Insurance Company v. Soule, 7
Wall. 433, held not to be a direct tax."
In Scholey v. Rlew, 23 Wall. 331, 346, 347, the question was,
whether a duty laid by the act of June 30, 1864, as amended,
14 Stat. 140, 141, upon successions was a direct tax within
the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. The
act provided that the duty shall be paid at the time when
the successor, or any person in his right or on his behalf,
shall become entitled in possession to his succession, or
to the receipt of the income and profits thereof. The act
further provided that "the term 'real estate' should include 'all lands, tenements, and hereditaments, corporeal
and incorporeal,' and that the term 'succession' should denote 'the devolution of title to any real estate.'" Also:
"That every past or future disposition of real estate by will,
deed, or laws of descent, by reason whereof any person
shall become beneficially entitled, in possession or expectancy, to any real estate, or the income thereof, upon the
death of any person entitled by reason of any such disposition, a ' succession;'" and that "the interest of any successor in moneys to arise from the sale of real estate, under
any trust for the sale thereof, shall be deemed to be a succession chargeable with duty under this act, and the said duty
shall be paid by the trustee, executor, or other person having
control of the funds." It is important also to observe that
this succession tax was made a lien on the land "in respect
whereof" it was laid, and was to be "collected by the same
officers, in the same manner, and by the same processes as
direct taxes upon lands, under the authority of the United
States." A duty was also imposed by the same act on legacies and distributive shares of personal property.
It would seem that this case was one that involved directly

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

655

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

the meaning of the words "direct taxes" in the Constitution.
In the argument of that case it was conceded by the counsel for
the taxpayer that the opinions in the Hylton case recognized a
tax on land and a capitation tax to be the only direot taxes
contemplated by the Constitution. But counsel said: "The
present is a tax on land, if ever one was. No doubt it is to be
paid by the owner of the land, if he can be made to pay it;
but that is true of any tax that ever was or ever can be
imposed on property. And as if to prove how directly the
property, and not the property owner, is aimed at, the duty is
made a specific lien and charge upon the land 'in respect
whereof'it is assessed. More than this: as if to show how
identical, in the opinion of Congress, this duty was with the
avowedly direct tax upon lands which it had levied but a year
or two before, it enacts that this succession tax alone, out
of a great revenue system, should be collected by the same
officers, in the same manner, and by the same processes as direct
taxes upon lands under the authority of the United States."
This interpretation of the Constitution was rejected by
every member of this court. Mr. Justice Clifford, delivering
the unanimous judgment of the court, said : " Support to the
first objection is attempted to be drawn from that clause of
the Constitution which provides that direct taxes shall be
apportioned among the several States which may be included
within the Union, according to their respective numbers; and
also from the clause which provides that no capitation or
other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or amended enumeration; but it is clear that the tax or
duty levied by the act under consideration is not a direct tax
within the meaning of either of those provisions. Instead of that
it is plainly an excise tax or duty, authorized by section eight
of article one, which vests power in Congress to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to pay the debts and provide
for the common defence and general welfare. Such a tax or
duty is neither a tax on land nor a capitation exaction, as subsequently appears from the language of the section imposing
the tax or duty, as well as from the preceding section, which
provides that the term ' succession' shall denote the devolution

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

of real estate; and the section which imposes the tax or
duty also contains a corresponding clause, which provides that
the term 'successor' shall denote the person so entitled, and
that the term ' predecessor ' shall denote the grantor, testator,
ancestor, or other person from whom the interest of the
successor has been or shall be derived." Again: "Whether
direct taxes, in the sense of the Constitution, comprehend any
other tax than a capitation tax and a tax on land, is a question
not absolutely decided, nor is it necessary to determine it in
the present case, as it is expressly decided that the term does
not include the tax on income, which cannot be distinguished
in principle from a succession tax such as the one involved in
the present controversy.

assume the form of duties, imposts, or excises, or they may
also assume the form of license fees for permission to carry on
particular occupations or to enjoy special franchises, or they
may be specific in form, as when levied upon corporations in
reference to the amount of capital stock or to the business done
or profits earned by the individual or corporation. Cooley

in the prior suggestions to define the language employed and
to point out what is the true intent and meaning of the provision, and to make it plain that the exaction is not a tax
upon the land, and that it was rightfully levied, if the findings
of the court show that the plaintiff became entitled, in the language of the section, or acquired the estate or the right to the
income thereof by the devolution of the title to the same, as
assumed by the United States."
The meaning of the words "direct taxes" was again the
subject of consideration by this court in Springer v. United
States, 102 U. S. 586, 599, 600, 602. A reference to the printed
arguments in that case will show that this question was most

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

thoroughly examined, every member of the court participating
in the decision. The question presented was as to the constitutionality of the act of June 30, 1864, c. 172, 13 Stat. 218,
as amended by the act of March 3, 1865, c. 78, 13 Stat. 469,
so far as it levied a duty upon gains, profits, and income
derived from every kind of property, and from every trade,
profession, or employment. The contention of Mr. Springer
was, that such a tax was a direct tax that could not be levied
except by apportioning the same among the States, on the
basis of numbers. In support of his position he cited numerous authorities, among them, all or most of the leading works
on political economy and taxation. Mr. Justice Swayne, again
delivering the unanimous judgment of this court, referred to
the proceedings and debates in the convention of 1787, to The
Federalist, to all the acts of Congress imposing taxation,
and to the previous cases of Hlylton v. United States, Pacific
Ins. Co. v. Soule, Veazie Bank v. Fenno, and Scholey v. Rew.
Among other things he said: "It does not appear that any
tax like the one here in question was ever regarded or treated
by Congress as a direct tax. This uniform practical construction of the Constitution touching so important a point, through
so long a period, by the legislative and executive departments
of the government, though not conclusive, is a consideration
of great weight." Alluding to the observations by one of the
Judges in the Iylton case as to the evils of an apportioned
tax on specific personal property, he said: "It was well held
that where such evils would attend the apportionment of a tax,
the Constitution could not have intended that an apportionment should be made. This view applies with even greater
force to the tax in question in this case. Where the population is large and the incomes are few and small, it would be
intolerably oppressive." After examining the cases above
cited, he concludes, speaking for the entire court: "All
these cases are undistinguishable in principle from the case
now before us, and they are decisive against the plaintiff in
error. The question, what is a direct tax, is one exclusively
in American jurisprudence. The text-writers of the country
are in entire accord upon the subject. Mr. Justice Story says

that all taxes are usually divided into two classes - those
which are direct and those which are indirect-and that
'under the former denomination are included taxes on land
or real property, and, under the latter, taxes on consumption.'

were only two, viz., a capitation or poll tax and a tax on
land.' 1 Kent Com. 257. See also Cooley, Taxation, p. 5,

We are not aware that any writer, since Ilylton v. United
States was decided, has expressed a view of the subject different from that of these authors. Our conclusions are, that
direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are only
capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument, and taxes on
real estate, and that the tax of which the plaintiff in error
complains is within the category of an excise or duty."
One additional authority may be cited- Clarke v. Sicket
etc., reported in 14 Int. Rev. Rec. 6, and referred to in the
opinion of this court in Scholey v. ilew. It was decided by
Mr. Justice Strong at the circuit in 1871. That case involved
the validity of a tax on income derived from an annuity
bequeathed by the will of the plaintiff's husband, and charged
(as the record of that case shows) upon his entire estate, real
and personal. The eminent jurist who decided the case said:
"The pleadings in all those cases raise the question whether
the act of Congress of June 30, 1864, c. 171, and its supplements, so far as they impose a tax upon the annual gains, profits, or income of every person residing in the United States,
or of any citizen of the United States residing abroad, are
within the power conferred by the Constitution upon Congress. If it be true, as has been argued, that the income tax
is a ' capitation or other direct tax' within the meaning of the
Constitution, it is undoubtedly prohibited by the first and
ninth sections of the first article, for it is not 'apportioned
among the States.' But I am of opinion that it is not a
'capitation or other direct tax' in the sense in which the

framers of the Constitution and the people of the States
who adopted it understood such taxes." The significance of
this language is manifest when the fact is recalled that the
act of 1864 provided, among other things, that (with certain
specified exceptions) a tax should be levied, collected, and
paid annually upon the annual gains, profits, or income of
every person residing in the United States, or of any citizen
of the United States residing abroad, whether derived from
any kind of property, renis, interest, dividends, salaries, or
from any profession, trade, employment, or vocation, carried
on in the United States or elsewhere, or fro?, any otlier
source wliatever. 13 Stat. 281.
From this history of legislation and of judicial decisions
it is manifestThat, in the judgment of the members of this court as constituted when the lylton case was decided - all of whom were
statesmen and lawyers of distinction, two, Wilson and Paterson, being recognized as great leaders in the convention of
1787-the only taxes that could certainly be regarded as
direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, were
capitation taxes and taxes on lands;
That, in their opinion, a tax on real estate was properly
classified as a direct tax, because, in the words of Justice
Iredell, it was "a tax on something inseparably annexed to
the soil," "something capable of apportionment," though, in
the opinion of Mr. Justice Paterson, apportionment even of a
tax on land was "scarcely practicable ;"
That while the Iylton case did not, in terms, involve a decision in respect of lands, what was said by the judges on the
subject was not, strictly speaking, obiter dicta, because the
principle or rule that would determine whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax would necessarily indicate whether a
tax on lands belonged to that class;
That, in the judgment of all the judges in the Iylton case,
no tax was a direct one, that could not be apportioned among
the States, on the basis of numbers, with some approach to
justice and equality among the people of the several States
who owned the property or subject taxed, for the reason, in

the words of Mr. Justice Chase, that the framers of the Constitution cannot be supposed to have contemplated taxation
by a rule that "would evidently create great inequality and
injustice;" or, in the words of Air. Justice Paterson, would
be "absurd and inequitable;" or, in the words of Mr. Justice
Iredell, would lead, if practised, to "dangerous consequences,"
and be "altogether destructive of the notion of a common interest, upon which the very principles of the Constitution are
founded ;"
That by the judgment in the Ilylton case, a tax on specific
personal property, owned by the taxpayer and used or let to
hire, was not a direct tax to be apportioned among the States
on the basis of numbers;
That from the foundation of the government, until 1861,
Congress following the declarations of the judges in the IHylton case, restricted direct taxation to real estate and slaves, and
in 1861 to real estate exclusively, and has never, by any statute, indicated its belief that personal property, however assessed or valued, was the subject of "direct taxes" to be
apportioned among the States;
That by the above two acts of January 18, 1815, the validity
of which has never been questioned, Congress by laying duties,
according to the rule of uniformity, upon the numerous articles of personal property mentioned in those acts, indicated
its belief that duties on personal property were not direct
taxes to be apportioned among the States on the basis of
numbers, but were duties to be laid by the rule of uniformity, and without regard to the population of the respective
States;
That in 1861 and subsequent years Congress imposed, without apportionment among the States on the basis of numbers,,
but by the rule of uniformity, duties on income derivedfromn
every kind of property, real and personal, including income
derived from rents, and from trades, professions, and employments, etc.; and, lastly,
That upon every occasion when it has considered the question whether a duty on incomes was a direct tax within the
meaning of the Constitution, this court has, without a dissent-

ing voice, determined it in the negative, always proceeding on
the ground that capitation taxes and taxes on land were the
only direct taxes contemplated by the framers of the Conistitution.
The view I have given of Ilylton v. United States is sustained by Mr. Justice Story's statement of the grounds upon
which the court proceeded in that case. He says: "The
grounds of this decision, as stated in the various opinions of
the judges, were, first, the doubt whether any taxes were
direct in the sense of the Constitution, but capitation and
land taxes, as has been already suggested; secondly, that in
cases of doubt the rule of apportionment ought not to be
favored, because it was matter of compromise, and in itself
radically indefensible and wrong; thirdly, the monstrous inequality and injustice of the carriage tax, if laid by the rule
of apportionment, which would show that no tax of this sort
could have been contemplated by the convention, as within
the rule of apportionment; fourthly, that the terms of the
'Constitution were satisfied by confining the clause respecting
direct taxes to capitation and land taxes; fifthly, that accurately speaking, all taxes on expenses or consumption are indirect taxes, and a tax on carriages is of this kind; and, sixthly,
',(what is probably of most cogency and force, and of itself
decisive,) that no tax could be a direct one, in the sense of
the Constitution, which was not capable of apportionment ac,cording to the rule laid down in the Constitution." 1 Story
Const. 705, § 956.
If the above summary as to the practice of the government,
and the course of decision in this court, fairly states what was
the situation, legislative and judicial, at the time the suits now
before us were instituted, it ought not to be deemed necessary,
in determining a question which this court has said was
"exclusively in American jurisprudence," to ascertain what
were the views and speculations of European writers and
theorists in respect of the nature of taxation and the principles
by which taxation should be controlled, nor as to what, on
merely economic or scientific grounds, and under the systems
of government prevailing in Europe, should be deemed direct

taxes, and what indirect taxes. Nor ought this court to be
embarrassed by the circumstance that statesmen of the early
period of our history differed as to the principles or methods
of national taxation, or as to what should be deemed direct
taxes to be apportioned among the States and what indirect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, that must be laid by some
rule of uniformity applicable to the whole country without
reference to the relative population of particular States.
Undoubtedly, as already observed, Madison was of opinion
that a tax on carriages was a direct tax within the meaning
of the Constitution, and should be apportioned among the
States on the basis of numbers. But this court, in the IJylton
case, rejected his view of the Constitution, sustained that of
Hamilton, and, subsequently, Madison, as President, approved
acts of Congress imposing taxes upon personal property without apportioning the same among the States. The taxes
which, in the opinion of Hamilton, ought to be apportioned
among the States were not left by him in doubt; for in a
draft of the Constitution prepared by him in 1787, it was provided that "taxes on lands, houses, and other real estate,
and capitation taxes, shall be proportioned in each State by
the whole number of free persons, except Indians not taxed,
and by three-fifths of all other persons." Art. VII, See. 4. 2
Hamilton's Works, 406. The practice of a century, in harmony
with the decisions of this court, under which uncounted millions have been collected by taxation, ought to be sufficient to
close the door against further inquiry, based upon the speculations of theorists, and the varying opinions of statesmen
who participated in the discussions, sometimes very bitter,
relating to the form of government to be established in place
of the Articles of Confederation under which, it has been well
said, Congress could declare everything and do nothing.
But this view has not been accepted in the present cases, and
the questions involved in them have been examined just as if
they had not been settled by the long practice of the government, as well as by judicial decisions covering the entire period
since 1796 and giving sanction to that practice. It seems to
me that the court has not given to the maxim of stare decisis

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

663

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

the full effect to which it is entitled. While obedience to that
maxim is not expressly enjoined by the Constitution, the principle that decisions, resting upon a particular interpretation
of that instrument, should not be lightly disregarded where
such interpretation has been long accepted and acted upon by
other branches of the government and by the public, underlies our American jurisprudence. There are many constitutional questions which were earnestly debated by statesmen
and lawyers in the early days of the Republic. But having
been determined by the judgments of this court, they have
ceased to be the subjects of discussion. While, in a large sense,
constitutional questions may not be considered as finally
settled, unless settled rightly, it is certain that a departure by
this court from a settled course of decisions on grave constitutional questions, under which vast transactions have occurred,
and under which the government has been administered during
great crises, will shake public confidence in the stability of
the law.
Since the fyllon case was decided this country has gone
through two great wars under legislation based on the principles of constitutional law previously announced by this
court. The recent civil war, involving the very existence of
the nation, was brought to a successful end, and the authority
of the Union restored, in part, by the use of vast amounts of
money raised under statutes imposing duties on incomes derived from every kind of property, real and personal, not by
the unequal rule of apportionment among the States on the
basis of numbers, but by the rule of uniformity, operating
upon individuals and corporations in all the States. And we
are now asked to declare - and the judgment this day rendered
in effect declares - that the enormous sums thus taken from the
people, and so used, were taken in violation of the supreme law
of the land. The supremacy of the nation was reestablished
against armed rebellion seeking to destroy its life, but, it
seems, that that consummation, so devoutly wished, and to
effect which so many valuable lives were sacrificed, was attended with a disregard of the Constitution by which the
Union was ordained.

The policy of the government in the matter of taxation for
its support, as well as the decisions of this court, have been in
harmony with the views expressed by Oliver Ellsworth, before he became the Chief Justice of this court. In the Connecticut Convention of 1788, when considering that clause of
the proposed constitution giving Congress power to lay and
collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, in order to pay the
debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare
of the United States, that far-seeing statesman- second to
none of the Revolutionary period, and whom John Adams
declared to be the firmest pillar of Washington's administration in the Senate -- said: " The first objection is, that this
clause extends to all the objects of taxation." "The state debt,
which now lies heavy upon us, arose from the want of powers in the Federal system. Give the necessary powers to the
National Government, and the State will not be again necessitated to involve itself in debt for its defence in war. It will
lie upon the National Government to defend all the States, to
defend all its members from hostile attacks. The United
States will bear the whole burden of war. It is necessary
that the power of the general legislature should extend to all
the objects of taxation; that government should be able to
command all the resources of the country; because no man
can tell what our exigencies may be. Wars have now become
rather wars of the purse than of the sword. Government
must, therefore, be able to command the whole power of the
purse; otherwise, a hostile nation may look into our Constitution, see what resources are in the power of government, and calculate to go a little beyond us; thus they may obtain a decided
superiority over us, and reduce us to the utmost distress. A
government which can command but half its resources is like
a man with but one arm to defend himself." Flanders' Chief
Justices, 150, 2d Series.
Let us examine the grounds upon which the decision of the
majority rests, and look at some of the consequences that
may result from the principles now announced. I have a
deep, abiding conviction, which my sense of duty compels
me to express, that it is not possible for this court to have

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

rendered any judgment more to be regretted than the one
just rendered.
Assuming it to be the settled construction of the Constitution that the general government cannot tax lands, eo nomine,
except by apportioning the tax among the States according
to their respective numbers, does it follow that a tax on incomes derived from rents is a direct tax on the real estate from
which such rents arise ?
In my judgment a tax on income derived from real property
ought not to be, and until now has never been, regarded by
any court as a direct tax on such property within the meaning of the Constitution. As the great mass of lands in most
of the States do not bring any rents, and as incomes from
rents vary in the different States, such a tax cannot possibly
be apportioned among the States on the basis merely of
numbers with any approach to equality of right among taxpayers, any more than a tax on carriages or other personal
property could be so apportioned. And, in view of former
adjudications, beginning with the Hylton case and ending
with the Springer case, a decision now that a tax on income
from real property can be laid and collected only by apportioning the same among the States, on the basis of numbers,
may, not improperly, be regarded as a judicial revolution,
that may sow the seeds of hate and distrust among the people
of different sections of our common country.
The principal authorities relied upon to prove that a tax on
rents is a direct tax on the lands from which such rents are
derived, are the decisions of this court holding that the States
cannot, in any form, directly or indirectly, burden the exercise
by Congress of the powers committed to it by the Constitution,' and those which hold that the national government
cannot, in any form, directly or indirectly, burden the agencies

or instrumentalities employed by the States in the exercise of
their powers.' No one of the cases of either class involved
any question as to what were " direct taxes" within the meaning of the Constitution. They were cases in which it was
held that the governmental power in question could not be
burdened or impaired at all or in any mode, directly or indirectly, by the government that attempted to do so. Every
one must concede that those cases would have been decided
just as they were decided, if there were no provision whatever
in the Constitution relating to direct taxes or to taxation in
any other mode. All property in this country, except the
property and the agencies and instrumentalities of the States,
may be taxed, in some form, by the national government in
order to pay the debts and provide for the common defence
and general welfare of the United States; some, by direct
taxation apportioned among the States on the basis of
numbers; other kinds, by duties, imposts, and excises, under
the rule of uniformity applicable throughout the United States
to individuals and corporations, and without reference to population in any State. Decisions, therefore, which hold that a
State can neither directly nor indirectly obstruct the execution by the general government of the powers committed to
it, nor burden with taxation the property and agencies of the
United States, and decisions that the United States can
neither directly nor indirectly burden nor tax the property
or agencies of the State, nor interfere with the governmental
powers belonging to the States, do not even tend to establish
the proposition that a duty which, by its indirect operation,
may affect the value or the use of particular property, is
a direct tax on such property, within the meaning of the
Constitution.
In determining whether a tax on income from rents is a
direct tax, within the meaning of the Constitution, the inquiry
is not whether it may in some way indirectly affect the land
or the land owner, but whether it is a direct tax on the thing

taxed, the land. The circumstance that such a tax may possibly have the effect to diminish the value of the use of the land
is neither decisive of the question nor important. While a tax
on the land itself, whether at a fixed rate applicable to all
lands without regard to their value, or by the acre or according to their market value, might be deemed a direct tax
within the meaning of the Constitution as interpreted in the
fylton case, a duty on rents is a duty on something distinct
and entirely separate from, although issuing out of, the land.
At the original hearing of this cause we were referred on
this point to the statement by Coke to the effect that "if a
man seized of land in fee by his deed granteth to another the
profits of those lands, to have and to hold to him and his.
heirs, and maketh livery secundumformam charitm, the whole
land itself doth pass. For what is the land but the profits
thereof; for thereby vesture, herbage, trees, mines, all whatsoever, parcel of that land doth pass." Co. Lit. 45. (4 b.) 1
HIar. & But. ed. § 1.
Of course, a grant, without limitation as to time, to a particular person and his heirs, of the profits of certain lands,
accompanied by livery of seizin, would be construed as passing

the lands themselves, unless a different interpretation were
required by some statute. In this *connection Jarman on
Wills (Vol. 1, 5th ed. 798*) is cited in support of the general
proposition that a devise of the rents and profits or of the
income of lands passes the land itself both at law and equity.
But the editor, after using this language, adds: "And since
the act 1 Vict. c. 26 such a devise carries a fee simple; but
before that act it carried no more than an estate for life unless
words of inheritance were added." Among the authorities
cited by the editor, in reference to devises of the incomes of
lands, are flumphrey v. HIumj)hrey, 1 Sim. (N. S.) 536, 540,
and Mannox v. Greener, L. R. 14 Eq. 456, 462. In the first
of those cases, the court held that "an unlimited gift of the
income of a fund" passed the capital; in the other, that "a
gift of the income of the land, unrestricted,is simply a gift of
the fee simple of the land." So, in _Fox v. Phelps, 17 Wend.
393, 402, Justice Bronson, speaking for the court, said: "An

ondlimited disposition of rents and profits or income of an
estate will sometimes carry the estate itself. Kerry v. Derriele, Cro. Jac. 104; Phillipsv. Clagnberlaine,4 Ves. 51. In
Newland v. Shepard, 2 P. Wins. 194, a devise of the produce
and interest of the estate to certain grandchildren for a limited
period was held to pass the estate itself. But the authority
of this case was denied by Lord Ilardwicke in Fonereau v.
-Fonereaa,3 Atk. 315. The rule cannot apply where, as in
this case, the rents and profits are only given for a limited
)eriod. Earl v. Grim, 1 Johns. Ch. 494." But who will say
that a devise of rent already due, or profits already earned, is
a devise of the land itself ? Or who would say that a devise
of rents, profits, or income of land for any period expressly
limited, would pass the fee or the ownership of the land itself?
The statute under examination in these causes expires by its
own terms at the end of five years. It imposes an annual tax
on the income of lands received the preceding year. It does
not touch the lands themselves, nor interfere with their sale
at the pleasure of the owner. It does not apply to lands from
which no rent is derived. It gives no lien upon the lands to
secure the payment of the duty laid on rents that may accrue
to the landlord from them. It does not apply to rents due
and payable by contract, and not collected, but only to such as
are received by the taxpayer. But whether a grant or devise,
with or without limitation or restriction, as to time, of the
rents and profits or of the income of land passes the land
itself, is wholly immaterial in the present causes. We are
-dealing here with questions relating to taxation for public
purposes of income from rents, and n'ot with any question as
to the passing of title, by deed or will, to the real estate
from which such rents may arise.
It has been well observed, on behalf of the government,
that rents have nothing in common with land; that taking
wrongful possession of land is trespass, while the taking of
rent may, under some circumstances, be stealing; that the
land goes to the heir while the rent-money goes to the personal representative; one has a fixed situs; that of the other
may be determined by law, but generally is that of the owner;

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

that one is taxed, and can be taxed only, by the sovereignty
within which it lies, while the other may be taxed, and can
be taxed only, by the sovereignty under whose dominion the
owner is; that a tax on land is generally a liem on the land,
while that on personalty almost universally is not; and that,
in their nature, lands and rents arising from land have not a
single attribute in common. A tax on land reaches the land
itself, whether it is rented or not: The citizen's residence
may be reached by a land tax, although he derives no rent
from it. But a duty on rents will not reach him, unless he
rents his residence to some one else and receives the rent.
A tax with respect to the money that a landlord receives for
rent is personal to him, because it relates to his revenue from
a designated source, and does not, in any sense -unless it be.
otherwise provided by statute-rest on the land. The tax
in question was laid without reference to the land of the taxpayer; for the amount of rent is a subject of contract, and is
not always regulated by the intrinsic value of the source from
which the rent arises. In its-essence it is a tax with reference
only to income received.
But the court, by its judgment just rendered, goes far in
advance not only of its former decisions, but of any decision heretofore rendered by an Arierican court. Adhering
to what was heretofore adjudged in these cases in respect,
of the taxation of income arising from real estate, it now
adjudges, upon the same grounds on which it proceeds in
reference to real estate and the income derived therefrom,
that a tax "on personal property," or on the yield or income
of personal property, or on capital in personalty held for the
purpose of income or ordinarily yielding income, and on the,
income therefrom, or on the income from "invested personal
property, bonds, stocks, investments of all kinds," is a direct
tax within the meaning of the Constitution, which cannot be
imposed by Congress unless it be apportioned among the
States on the basis of population.
I cannot assent to the view that visible tangible personal
property is not subject to a national tax under the rule of uniformity, whether such uniformity means only territorial uni-

formity, or equality of right among all taxpayers of the same
class. When direct taxes are restricted to capitation taxes
and taxes on land, taxation, in either form, is limited to subjects always found wherever population is found, and which
cannot be consumed or destroyed. They are subjects which
can always be seen and inspected by the assessor, and have
immediate connection with the country and its soil throughout
its entire limits. Not so with personal property. In Veazie
Bank v. Fenno, above cited, it was said that personal property
had never been regarded by Congress as subject to "direct
taxes," although it was said that, in the opinion of some
statesmen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution,
direct taxes "_erhaps" included such as might be levied "by
valuation and assessment of personal property upon general
lists," or, as expressed by Hamilton in his argument in the
Hfylton case, "general assessments, whether on the whole
property of individuals, or on their whole real or personal
estate." 7 Hamilton's Works, 848. The statute now before
us makes no provision for the taxation of personal property
by valuation and assessment upon general lists.
In the Ilylton case this court - proceeding, as I think, upon
a sound interpretation of the Constitution, and in accordance
with historical evidence of great cogency - unanimously held
that an act imposing a specific duty on carriages for the conveyance of persons was a valid exercise of the power to lay
and collect duties, as distinguished from direct taxes. The
majority of the court now sustain the position taken by Madison, who insisted that such a duty was a direct tax within the
meaning of the Constitution. So much pains would not have
been taken to bring out his view of direct taxes, unless to
indicate this court's approval of them, notwithstanding a contrary interpretation of the Constitution had been announced
and acted upon for nearly one hundred years. It must be
assumed, therefore, that the court, as now constituted, would
adjudge to be unconstitutional not only any act like that of
1794 laying specific duties on carriages without apportioning
the same among the States, but acts similar to those of 1815,
laying duties, according to the rule of uniformity, upon

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

specific personal property owned or manufactured in this
country.
In my judgment -to
say nothing of the disregard of the
former adjudications of this court, and of the settled practice
of the government -this decision may well excite the gravest
apprehensions. It strikes at the very foundations of national
authority, in that it denies to the general government a power
which is, or may become, vital to the very existence and preservation of the Union in a national emergency, such as that
of war with a great commercial nation, during which the collection of all duties upon imports will cease or be materially
diminished. It tends to re~stablish that condition of helplessness in which Congress found itself during the period of the
Articles of Confederation, when it was without authority by
laws operating directly upon individuals, to lay and collect,
through its own agents, taxes sufficient to pay the debts and
defray the expenses of government, but was dependent, in all
such matters, upon the good will of the States, and their
promptness in meeting requisitions made upon them by
Congress.
Why do I say that the decision just rendered impairs or
menaces the national authority ? The reason is so apparent
that it need only be stated. In its practical operation this decision withdraws from national taxation not only all incomes
derived from real estate, but tangible personal property, "invested personal property, bonds, stocks, investments of all
kinds," and the income that may be derived from such property. This results from the fact that by the decision of the
court, all such personal property and all incomes from real
estate and personal property, are placed beyond national
taxation otherwise than by apportionment among the States
on the basis simply of population. No such apportionment
can possibly be made without doing gross injustice to the
many for the benefit of the favored few in particular States.
Any attempt upon the part of Congress to apportion among
the States, upon the basis simply of their population, taxation
of personal property or of incomes, would tend to arouse such
indignation among the freemen of America that it would never

be repeated. When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does
now adjudge, that Congress cannot impose a duty or tax upon
personal property, or upon income arising either from rents of
real estate or from personal property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds,
except by apportioning the sum to be so raised among the
States according to population, it _practically decides that,
without an amendment of the Constitution- two-thirds of
both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States concurring - such property and incomes can never be made to
contribute to the support of the national government.
But this is not all. The decision now made may provoke a
contest in this country from which the American people would
have been spared if the court had not overturned its former
adjudications, and had adhered to the principles of taxation
under which our government, following the repeated adjudications of this court, has always been administered. Thoughtful, conservative men have uniformly held that the government
could not be safely administered except upon principles of right,
justice, and equality - without discrimination against any part
of the people because of their owning or not owning visible
property, or because of their having or not having incomes
from bonds and stocks. But, by its present construction of the
Constitution the court, for the first time in all its history, declares that our government has been so framed that, in matters
of taxation for its support and maintenance those who have
incomes derived from the renting of real estate or from the
leasing or using of tangible personal property, or who own
invested personal property, bonds, stocks and investments of
whatever kind, have privileges that cannot be accorded to those
having incomes derived from the labor of their hands, or the exercise of their skill, or the use of their brains. Let me illustrate
this. In the large cities or financial centres of the country
there are persons deriving enormous incomes from the renting
of houses that have been erected, not to be occupied by the
owner, but for the sole purpose of being rented. Near by are
other persons, trusts, combinations, and corporations, possessing vast quantities of personal property, including bonds and

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

stocks of railroad, telegraph, mining, telephone, banking, coal,
oil, gas, and sugar-refining corporations, from which millions
upon millions of income are regularly derived. In the same
neighborhood are others who own neither real estate, nor invested personal property, nor bonds, nor stocks of any kind,
and whose entire income arises from the skill and industry
displayed by them in particular callings, trades, or professions,
or from the labor of their hands, or the use of their brains.
And it is now the law, as this day declared, that under the
Constitution, however urgent may be the needs of the Government, however sorely the administration in power may be
pressed to meet the moneyed obligations of the nation, Congress cannot tax the personal property of the country, nor the
income arising either from real estate or from invested personal property, except by a tax apportioned among the States,
on the basis of their population, while it may compel the merchant, the artisan, the workman, the artist, the author, the
lawyer, the physician, even the minister of the Gospel, no one
of whom happens to own real estate, invested personal property, stocks or bonds, to contribute directly from their respective earnings, gains, and profits, and under the rule of
uniformity or equality, for the support of the government.
The Attorney General of the United States very appropriately said that the constitutional exemption from taxation of
incomes arising from the rents of real estate, otherwise than
by a direct tax, apportioned among the States on the basis of
numbers, was a new theory of the Constitution, the importance of which to the whole country could not be exaggerated.
If any one has questioned the correctness of that view of the
decision rendered on the original hearing, it ought not again to
be questioned, now that this court has included in the constitutional exemption from the rule of uniformity, the personal property of the country and incomes derived from invested personal
property. If Congress shall hereafter impose an income tax in
order to meet the pressing debts of the nation and to provide
for the necessary expenses of the government, it is advised, by
the judgment now rendered, that it cannot touch the income
from real estate nor the income from personal property, inVOL. CLvm-43

vested or uninvested, except by apportionment among the
States on the basis of population. Under that system the
people of a State, containing 1,000,000 of inhabitants, who
receive annually $20,000,000 of income from real and personal
property, would pay no more than would be exacted from the
people of another State, having the same number of inhabitants, but who receive income from the same kind of property
of only $5,000,000. If this new theory of the Constitution, as
I believe it to be, if this new departure from the safe way
marked out by the fathers and so long followed by this court,
is justified by the fundamental law, the American people cannot too soon amend their Constitution.
It was said in argument that the passage of the statute imposing this income tax was an assault by the poor upon the
rich, and by much eloquent speech this court has been urged
to stand in the breach for the protection of the just rights of
property against the advancing hosts of socialism. With the
policy of legislation of this character, this court has nothing
to do. That is for the legislative branch of the government.
It is for Congress to determine whether the necessities of the
government are to be met, or the interests of the people subserved, by the taxation of incomes. With that determination,
so far as it rests upon grounds of expediency or public policy,
the courts can have no rightful concern. The safety and
permanency of our institutions demand that each department
of government shall keep within its legitimate sphere as defined by the supreme law of the land. We deal here only
with questions of law. Undoubtedly, the present law contains
exemptions that are open to objection, but, for reasons to be
presently stated, such exemptions may be disregarded without
invalidating the entire law and the property so exempted
may be reached under the general provisions of the statute.
JIntington v. Worthen, 120 U. S. 97, 102.
If it were true that this legislation, in its important aspects
and in its essence, discriminated against the rich, because of
their wealth, the court, in vindication of the equality of all
before the law, might well declare that the statute was not an
exercise of the power of taxation, but was repugnant to those

LOAN & TRUST CO.

675

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

principles of natural right upon which our free institutions
rest, and, therefore, was legislative spoliation, under the guise
of taxation. But it is not of that character. There is no
foundation for the charge that this statute was framed in
sheer hostility to the wealth of the country. The provisions
most liable to objection are those exempting from taxation
large amounts of accumulated capital, particularly that
represented by savings banks, mutual insurance companies,
and loan associations. Surely such exemptions do not indicate
sympathy on the part of the legislative branch of the government with the pernicious theories of socialism, nor show that
Congress had any purpose to despoil the rich.
In this connection, and as a ground for annulling the provisions taxing incomes, counsel for the appellant refers to the
exemption of incomes that do not exceed $4000. It is said
that such an exemption is too large in amount. That may be
conceded. But the court cannot for that reason alone declare
the exemption to be invalid. Every one, I take it, will concede
that Congress, in taxing incomes, may rightfully allow an
exemption in some amount. That was done in the income
tax laws of 1861 and in subsequent laws, and was never
questioned. Such exemptions rest upon grounds of public
policy, of which Congress must judge, and of which this court
cannot rightfully judge; and that determination cannot be
interfered with by the judicial branch of the government,
unless the exemption is of such a character and is so unreasonably large as to authorize the court to say that Congress,
under the pretence merely of legislating for the general good,
has put upon a few persons burdens that, by every principle of
justice and under every sound view of taxation, ought to have
been placed upon all or upon the great mass of the people.
If the exemption had been placed at $1500 or even $2000,
few, I think, would have contended that Congress, in so doing,
had exceeded its powers. In view of the increased cost of
living at this day, as compared with other times, the difference
between either of those amounts and $4000 is not so great as
to justify the courts in striking down all of the income tax provisions. The basis upon which such exemptions rest is that

the general welfare requires that in taxing incomes, such
exemption should be made as will fairly cover the annual
expenses of the average family, and thus prevent the members
of such families becoming a charge upon the public. The
statute allows corporations, when making returns of their
net profits or income, to deduct actual operating and business expenses. Upon like grounds, as I suppose, Congress
exempted incomes under $4000.
I may say, in answer to the appeals made to this court
to vindicate the constitutional rights of citizens owning large
properties and having large incomes, that the real friends of
property are not those who would exempt the wealth of thei
country from bearing its fair share of the burdens of taxation,
but rather those who seek to have every one, without reference
to his locality, contribute from his substance, upon terms of
equality with all others, to the support of the government.
There is nothing in the nature of an income tax per se that
justifies judicial opposition to it upon the ground that it.
illegally discriminates against the rich or imposes undue burdens upon that class. There is no tax which, in its essence,
is more just and equitable than an income tax, if the statute,
imposing it allows only such exemptions as are demanded by
public considerations and are consistent with the recognized
principles of the equality of all persons before the law, and,,
while providing for its collection in ways that do not unnecessarily irritate and annoy the taxpayer, reaches the earnings
of the entire property of the country, except governmental
property and agencies, and compels those, whether individuals
or corporations, who receive such earnings, to contribute therefrom a reasonable amount for the support of the common
government of all.
We are told in argument that the burden of this income
tax, if collected, will fall, and was imposed that it might fall,

almost entirely upon the people of a few States, and that it
has been imposed by the votes of Senators and Representatives of States whose people will pay relatively a very small
part of it. This suggestion, it is supposed, throws light upon
the construction to be given to the Constitution, and consti-

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

tutes a sufficient reason why this court should strike down the
provision that Congress has made for an income tax. It is a
suggestion that ought never to have been made in a court of
justice. But it seems to have received some consideration;
for, it is said that the grant of the power to lay and collect
direct taxes was, in the belief of the framers of the Constitution, that it would not be exercised "unfairly and discriminately, as to particular States or otherwise, by a mere majority
vote, possibly of those whose constituents were intentionally
not subjected to any part of the burden." It is cause for profound regret that it has been deemed appropriate to intimate
that the law now before us had its origin in a desire upon the
part of a majority in the two Houses of Congress to impose
undue burdens upon the people of particular States.
I am unable to perceive that the performance of our duty
should depend, in any degree, upon an inquiry as to the residence of the persons who are required by the statute to pay
this income tax. If, under the bounty of the United States,
or the beneficent legislation of Congress, or for any other
reason, some parts of the country have outstripped other
parts in population and wealth, that surely is no reason why
people of the more favored States should not share in the
burdens of government alike with the people of all the States
of the Union. Is a given body of people in one part of the
United States, although owning vast properties, from which
many millions are regularly derived, of more consequence in
the eye of the Constitution or of the judicial tribunals than
the like number of people in other parts of the country who
do not enjoy the same prosperity ? Arguments that rest upon
favoritism by the law-making power to particular sections of
the country and to mere property, or to particular kinds of
property, do not commend themselves to my mind; for, they
cannot but tend to arouse a conflict that may result in giving
life, energy, and power as well to those in our midst who are
eager to array section against section as to those, unhappily not
few in number, who are without any proper idea of our free institutions, and who have neither respect for the rights of property nor any conception of what is liberty regulated by law.

It is said that if the necessity exists for the general government to raise by direct taxation a given sum of money, in
addition to the revenue from duties, imposts, and excises, the
quota of each State can be apportioned on the basis of the
census, and the government can proceed to assess the amount
to be raised on all the real and personal property, as well as
the income, of all persons in the State, and collect the tax,
if the State does not in the meantime pay its quota, and reimburse itself, by collecting the amount paid by it, according to
its own system and in its own way. Of course, it is not difficult to understand that a direct tax, when assessed, may be
collected by the general government without waiting for the
States to pay the sum apportioned to their people, or that
time may be given to the States to pay such amounts. But
that view does not meet the argument that the assessment
and collection of a direct tax on incomes- such tax being
apportioned on the basis merely of numbers in the respective
States-was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. Whether such a tax be collected by the general
government through its own agents, or by the State, from
such of the people as have incomes sutbject to the tax imposed,
is immaterial to the discussion. In either case, the gross
injustice that would result would be the same.
If Congress should lay a tax of a given aggregate amount
on incomes (above a named sum) from every taxable source,
and apportion the same among the States on the basis of
numbers, could any State be expected to assume and pay the
sum assigned to it, and then proceed to reimburse itself by
taxing all the property, real and personal, within its limits,
thereby compelling those who have no taxable incomes to
contribute from their means to pay taxes assessed upon those
who have taxable incomes? Would any State use money
belonging to all of its people for the purpose of discharging
taxes due from, or assessed against, a part of them? Is it not
manifest that a national tax laid on incomes or on specific
personal property, if apportioned among the States on the
basis of population, might be ruinous to the people of those
States in which the number having taxable incomes, or

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

who owned that particular kind of property, were relatively
few when the entire population of the State is taken into
account? So diversified are the industries of the States composing the Union that, if the government should select particular subjects or products for taxation and apportion the
sum to be raised among the States, according to their population, the amount paid by some of the States would be out of
all proportion to the quantity or value of such products within
their respective limits.
It has been also said, or rather it is intimated, that the
framers of the Constitution intended that the power to lay
direct taxes should only be exercised in time of war, or in
great emergencies, and that a tax on incomes is not justified
in times of peace. Is it to be understood that the courts may
annul an act of Congress imposing a tax on incomes, whenever in their judgment such legislation is not demanded by
any public emergency or pressing necessity? Is a tax on
incomes permissible in a time of war, but unconstitutional in
a time of peace? Is the judiciary to supervise the action
of the legislative branch of the government upon questions
of public policy? Are they to override the will of the people,
as expressed by their chosen servants, because, in their judgment, the particular means employed by Congress in execution of the powers conferred by the Constitution are not the
best that could have been devised, or are not absolutely necessary to accomplish the objects for which the government was
established?
It is further said that the withdrawal from national taxation, except by apportionment among the States on the basis
of numbers, of personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds, and the income arising therefrom, as well
as the income derived from real estate, is intrinsically just,
because all such property and all such incomes can be made
to bear, and do bear, their share of the burdens that come
from state taxation. But those who make this argument
forget that all the property which, by the decision now rendered, remains subject to national taxation by the rule of
uniformity is, also, subject to be taxed by the respective

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

States. Incomes arising from trades, employments, callings,
and professions can be taxed, under the rule of uniformity or
equality, by both the national government and the respective state governments, while incomes from property, bonds,
stocks, and investments cannot, under the present decision,
be taxed by the national government except under the impracticable rule of apportionment among the States according to
population. No sound reason for such a discrimination has
been or can be suggested.
I am of opinion that with the exception of capitation and
land taxes, and taxes on exports from the States and on the
property and instrumentalities of the States, the government
of the Union, in order to pay its debts and provide for the
common defence and the general welfare, and under its power
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, may
reach, under the rule of uniformity, all property and property
rights in whatever State they may be found. This is as it
should be, and as it must be, if the national government is to
be administered upon principles of right and justice, and is to
accomplish the beneficent ends for which it was established
by the People of the United States. The authority to sustain
itself, and, by its own agents and laws, to execute the powers
granted to it, are the features that particularly distinguish the
present government from the Confederation which Washington characterized as "a half-starved, limping government,"
that was "always moving upon crutches and tottering at
every step." The vast powers committed to the present government may be abused, and taxes may be imposed by Congress which the public necessities do not in fact require, or
which may be forbidden by a wise policy. But the remedy
for such abuses is to be found at the ballot-box, and in a wholesome public opinion which the representatives of the people
will not long, if at all, disregard, and not in the disregard by
the judiciary of powers that have been committed to another
branch of the government.
I turn now to another part of these cases. The majority
having decided that the income tax provisions of the statute in
question are unconstitutional in so far as they impose a tax on

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

681

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

income derived from rents, or on income derived from personal
property, including invested personal property, the conclusion
has been reached that all the income tax provisions of the
statute, those that are valid as well as those held to be invalid,
must be held inoperative and void. And so the judgment now
to be entered takes from the government the entire revenue that
Congress expected to raise by the taxation of incomes. This
revenue, according to all the estimates submitted to us in argument, would not have been less than $30,000,000. Some have
estimated that it would amount to $40,000,000 or $50,000,000.
The ground upon which the court now strikes down all the
provisions of the statute relating in anywise to incomes is, that
it cannot be assumed that Congress would have provided for
an income tax at all, if it had been known or believed that the
provisions taxing incomes from rents and from invested personal property were unconstitutional and void.
In Allen v. louisiana,103 U. S. 80, 84, this court said that it
was an elementary principle " that the same statute may be
in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional, and that if
the parts are wholly independent of each other, that which is
constitutional may stand, while that which is unconstitutional
will be rejected." "The point to be determined in all such
cases,'.' the court further said, "is whether the unconstitutional provisions are so connected with the general scope of the
law as to make it impossible, if they are stricken out, to give
effect to what appears to have been the intent of the legislature."
A leading case on this subject is IHuntington v. Worthen,
120 U. S. 97, 102. The constitution of Arkansas of 1874 provided that all property subject to taxation should be taxed
according to its value, to be ascertained in such manner as
the general assembly might direct, making the same equal
and uniform throughout the State, and that no one species of
property from which a tax may be collected should be taxed
higher than another species of property of equal value. The
constitution of the State further declared that all laws exempting property from taxation other than as provided in that
instrument should be void. No part of the property of rail-

road companies was exempted by the constitution from taxation. A subsequent statute, provided for the taxation of the
property of railroad companies, excepting, however, from the
schedule of property required to be returned "embankments,
turnouts, cuts, ties, trestles, or bridges." This court held that
the exemption of these items of railroad property was invalid,
and the question arose whether the statute could be enforced.
This court said: "The unconstitutional part of the statute was
separable from the remainder. The statute declared that, in
making its statement of the value of its property, the railroad company should omit certain items; that clause being
held invalid, the rest remained unaffected, and could be
fully carried out. An exemption, which was invalid, was.
alone taken from it. It is only when different clauses of an
act are so dependent upon each other that it is evident the
legislature would not have enacted one of them without the
bther -as
when the two things provided are necessary parts
of one system -the whole act will fall with the invalidity of
one clause. When there is no such connection and dependency, the act will stand, though different parts of it are
rejected."
It should be observed that the legislature of Arkansas
evinced a purpose not to tax embankments, turnouts, cuts, ties,
trestles, or bridges, and yet their exemption of those items,
was disregarded and such property was taxed. The same rule
could be applied to the present statute.
The opinion and judgment of the court on the original hearing of these cases annulled only so much of the statute as laid
a duty on incomes derived from rents. The opinion and judgment on this rehearing annuls also so much of the statute as
lays a duty on the yield or income derived from personal property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, investments of all kinds. I recognize that with all these parts
of the statute stricken out, the law would operate unequally
and unjustly upon many of the people. But I do not feel at
liberty to say that the balance of the act relating to incomes
from other and distinct sources must fall.
it seems to me that the cases do not justify the conclusion

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

683

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

that all the income tax sections of the statute must fall
because some of them are declared to be invalid. Those sections embrace a large number of taxable subjects that do not
depend upon, and have no necessary connection whatever
with, the sections or clauses relating to income from rents of
land and from personal property. As the statute in question
states that its principal object was to reduce taxation and provide revenue, it must be assumed that such revenue is needed
for the support of the government, and, therefore, its sections,
so far as they are valid, should remain, while those that are,
invalid should be disregarded. The rule referred to in the
cases above cited should not be applied with strictness where
the law in question is a general law providing a revenue for
the government. Parts of the statute being adjudged to be
void, the injustice done to those whose incomes may be
reached by those provisions of the statute that are not
declared to be, in themselves, invalid, could, in some way, be
compensated by subsequent legislation.
If the sections of the statute relating to a tax upon incomes
derived from other sources than rents and invested 'personal
property are to fall because and only because those relating
to rents and to income from invested personal property are
invalid, let us see to what result such a rule may logically
lead. There is no distinct, separate statute providing for a
tax upon incomes. The income tax is prescribed by certain
sections of a general statute known as the Wilson Tariff act.
The judgment just rendered defeats the purpose of Congress
by taking out of the revenue not less than thirty millions,
and possibly fifty millions of dollars, expected to be raised
by the duty on incomes. We know from the official journals
of both Houses of Congress that taxation on imports would
not have been reduced to the extent it was by the Wilson
act, except for the belief that that could be safely done if
the country had the benefit of revenue derived from a tax
on incomes. We know, from official sources, that each House
of Congress distinctly refused to strike out the provisions
imposing a tax on incomes. The two Houses indicated in
every possible way that it must be a part of any scheme for

f684

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

the reduction of taxation and for raising revenue for the
:support of the government, that (with certain specified exceptions) incomes arising from every kind of property and from
every trade and calling should bear some of the burdens of
the taxation imposed. If the court knows, or is justified in
believing, that Congress would not have provided an income
tax that did not include a tax on incomes from real estate
.and personal property, we are more justified in believing that
no part of the Wilson act would have become a law, without
provision being made in it for an income tax. If, therefore,
all the income tax sections of the Wilson act must fall because
some of them are invalid, does not the judgment this day
rendered furnish ground for the contention that the entire
act falls when the court strikes from it all of the income tax
provisions, without which, as every one knows, the act would
never have been passed ?
But the court takes care to say that there is no question as
to the validity of any part of the Wilson act, except those
;sections providing for a tax on incomes. Thus something is
saved for the support and maintenance of the government.
It, nevertheless, results that those parts of the Wilson act
that survive the new theory of the Constitution evolved by
these cases, are those imposing burdens upon the great body
of the American people who derive no rents from real estate,
and who are not so fortunate as to own invested personal
property, such as the bonds or stocks of corporations, that
hold within their control almost the entire business of the
-country.
Such a result is one to be deeply deplored. It cannot be
regarded otherwise than as a disaster to the country. The
decree now passed dislocates- principally, for reasons of an
.economic nature- a sovereign power expressly granted to the
general government and long recognized and fully established
by judicial decisions and legislative actions. It so interprets
constitutional provisions, originally designed to protect the
,slave property against oppressive taxation, as to give privileges and immunities never contemplated by the founders
of the government.

to cause anxiety or regret; for, in such a case, Congress could
have enacted a new statute that would not have been liable to,
constitutional objections. But the serious aspect of the present decision is that by a new interpretation of the Constitution, it so ties the hands of the legislative branch of the government, that without an amendment of that instrument, or,
unless this court, at some future time, should return to the
old theory of the Constitution, Congress cannot subject to
taxation - however great the needs or pressing the necessities of the government -either the invested personal property of the country, bonds, stocks, and investments of all
kinds, or the income arising from the renting of real estate,.
or from the yield of personal property, except by the grossly
unequal and unjust rule of apportionment among the States..
Thus, undue and disproportioned burdens are placed upon,
the many, while the few, safely entrenched behind the rule,
of apportionment among the States on the basis of numbers,
are permitted to evade their share of responsibility for the.
support of the government ordained for the protection of
the rights of all.
I cannot assent to an interpretation of the Constitution that
impairs and cripples the just powers of the National Government in the essential matter of taxation, and at the same time
discriminates against the greater part of the people of our
country.
The practical effect of the decision to-day is to give to certain
kinds of property a position of favoritism and advantage inconsistent with the fundamental principles of our social organization, and to invest them with power and influence that may
be perilous to that portion of the American people upon whom
rests the larger part of the burdens of the government, and
who ought not to be subjected to the dominion of aggregated
wealth any more than the property of the country should be
at the mercy of the lawless.

If the question what is, and what is not, a direct tax, were
now, for the first time, presented, I should entertain a grave
doubt whether, in view of the definitions of a direct tax given
by the courts and writers upon political economy, during the
present century, it ought not to be held to apply not only to
an income tax, but to every tax, the burden of which is borne,
both immediately and ultimately, by the person paying it.
It does not, however, follow that this is the definition had in
mind by the framers of the Constitution. The clause that
.direct taxes shall be apportioned according to the population
was adopted, as was said by Mr. Justice Paterson, in Iylton
v. United States, to meet a demand on the part of the Southern
States, that representatives and direct taxes should be apportioned among the States according to their respective numbers.
In this connection he observes: "The provision was made in
favor of the Southern States. They possessed a large number
of slaves; they had extensive tracts of territory, thinly settled
and not very productive. A majority of the States had but
few slaves, and several of them a limited territory, well settled
and in a high state of cultivation. The Southern States, if no
provision had been introduced in the Constitution, would have
been wholly at the mercy of the other States. Congress, in
such case, might tax slaves, at discretion or arbitrarily, and
land in every part of the Union at the same rate or measure;
so much a head in the first instance, and so much an acre in
the second. To guard them against imposition, in these particulars, was the reason for introducing the clause in the Constitution, which directs that representatives and direct taxes
shall be apportioned among the States according to their
respectives numbers." 3 Dall. 177.
In view of the fact that the great burden of taxation among
the several States is assessed upon real estate at a valuation,
and that a similar tax was apparently an important part of
the revenue of such States at the time the Constitution was

adopted, it is not unreasonable to suppose that this is the only
undefined direct tax the framers of the Constitution had in
view when they incorporated this clause into that instrument.
The significance of the words "direct taxes" was not so well
understood then as it is now, and it is entirely probable that
these words were used with reference to a generally accepted
method of raising a revenue by tax upon real estate.
That the rule of apportionment was adopted for a special
and temporary purpose, that passed away with the existence
of slavery, and that it should be narrowly construed, is also evident from the opinion of Mr. Justice Paterson, wherein he
says that "the Constitution has been considered as an accommodating system; it was the effect of mutual sacrifices and
concessions; it was the work of compromise. The rule of
apportionment is of this nature; it is radically wrong; it cannot be supported by any solid *easoning. Why should slaves,
who are a species of property, be represented more than any
other property? The rule ought not, therefore, to be extended
by construction. Again, numbers do not afford a just estimate or rule of wealth. It is, indeed, a very uncertain and
incompetent sign of opulence. There is another reason against
the extension of the principle, laid down in the Constitution."
But, however this may be, I regard it as very clear that
the clause requiring direct taxes to be apportioned to the population has no application to taxes which are not capable of
.apportionment according to population. It cannot be supposed
that the convention could have contemplated a practical inhibition upon the power of Congress to tax in some way all taxable
property within the jurisdiction of the Federal government, for
the purposes of a national revenue. And if the proposed tax
were such that in its nature it could not be apportioned according to population, it naturally follows that it could not have been
considered a direct tax, within the meaning of the clause in question. This was the opinion of Mr. Justice Iredell in the flylton,
case, wherein he shows at considerable length the fact that the
tax upon carriages, in question in that case, was not such as
could be apportioned, and, therefore, was not a direct tax in
the sense of the Constitution. " Suppose," he said, "ten dol-

lars contemplated as a tax on each chariot, or post chaise, in
the United States, and the number of both in all the States
be computed at 105 -the number of Representatives in Congress-this would produce in the whole one thousand and
fifty dollars; the share of Virginia, being 10 parts, would
be $190; the share of Connecticut, being -0l parts, would be
$70; then suppose Virginia had fifty carriages, Connecticut
two, the share of Virginia being $190, this must of course
be collected from the owners of carriages, and there would,
therefore, be collected from each carriage $3.80; the share
of Connecticut being $70, each carriage would pay $35." In
fact, it needs no demonstration to show that taxes upon carriages or any particular article of personal property, apportioned to the population of the several States, would lead to
the grossest inequalities, since the number of like articles in
such State respectively might bear a greatly unequal proportion to the population. This was also the construction put
upon the clause by Mr. Justice Story, in his work upon the
Constitution, §§ 955, 956.
Applying the same course of reasoning to the income tax,
let us see what the result would be. By the census of 1890
the population of the United States was 62,622,250. Suppose
Congress desired to raise by an income tax the same number
of dollars, or the equivalent of one dollar from each inhabitant.
Under this system of apportionment, Massachusetts would
pay $2,238,943. South Carolina would pay $1,151,149. Massachusetts has, however, $2,803,645,447 of property, with which
to pay it, or $1252 per capita, while South Carolina has but
$400,911,303 of property, or $348 to each inhabitant. Assuming that the same amount of property in each State represents
a corresponding amount of income, each inhabitant of South
Carolina would pay in proportion to his means three and onehalf times as much as each inhabitant of Massachusetts. By
the same course of reasoning, Mississippi, with a valuation of
$352 _per capita, would pay four times as much as Rhode
Island, with a valuation of $1459 _per capita. North Carolina,
with a valuation of $361 per capita, would pay about four
times as much, in proportion to her means, as New York,

with a valuation of $1430 per capita; while Maine, with a
per capita valuation of $740, would pay about twice as much.
Alabama, with a valuation of $412, would pay nearly three
times as much as Pennsylvania, with a valuation of $1177
per capita. In fact, there are scarcely two States that would
pay the same amount in proportion to their ability to pay.
If the States should adopt a similar system of taxation, and
allot the amount to be raised among the different cities and
towns, or among the different wards of the same city, in proportion to their population, the result would be so monstrous
that the entire public would cry out against it. Indeed,
reduced to its last analysis, it imposes the same tax upon the
laborer that it does upon the millionaire.
So also, whenever this court has been called upon to give
a construction to this clause of the Constitution, it has universally held the words " direct taxes" applied only to capitation taxes and taxes upon land. In the five cases most directly
in point it was held that the following taxes were not direct,
but rather in the nature of duty or excise, viz., a tax upon
carriages, fylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171; a tax upon
the business of insurance companies, Pacifc Insurance Co. v.
Soule, 7 Wall. 443; a tax of ten per cent upon the notes of
state banks held by national banks, Veazie v. Fenno, 8 Wall.
533; a tax upon the devolution of real estate, Scholey v. -Rew,
23 Wall. 331; and, finally, a general income tax was broadly
upheld in Sringer v. United States, 102 U. S.586. These
cases, consistent and undeviating as they are, and extending
over nearly a century of our national life, seem to me to
establish a canon of interpretation, which it is now too late to
overthrow, or even to question. If there be any weight at
all to be given to the doctrine of stare decisis, it surely ought
to apply to a theory of constitutional construction, which has
received the deliberate sanction of this court in five cases,
and upon the faith of which Congress has enacted two income
taxes at times when, in its judgment, extraordinary sources of
revenue were necessary to be made available.
I have always entertained the view that, in cases turning
upon questions of jurisdiction, or involving only the rights
VOL. cL-vf-44

of private parties, courts should feel at liberty to settle principles of law according to the opinions of their existing members, neither regardless of, nor implicitly bound by, prior
decisions, subject only to the condition that they do not
require the disturbance of settled rules of property. There
are a vast number of questions, however, which it is more
important should be settled in some way than that they
should be settled right, and once settled by the solemn adjudication of the court of last resort, the legislature and the
people have a right to rely upon such settlement as forever
fixing their rights in that connection. Even "a century of
error" may be less pregnant with evil to the State than a long
deferred discovery of the truth. I cannot reconcile myself to
the idea that adjudications thus solemnly made, usually by a
unanimous court, should now be set aside by reason of a
doubt as to the correctness of those adjudications, or because
we may suspect that possibly the cases would have been
otherwise decided, if the court had had before it the wealth
of learning which has been brought to bear upon the
consideration of this case. Congress ought never to legislate, in raising the revenues of the government, in fear that
important laws like this shall encounter the veto of this court
through a change in its opinion, or be crippled in great political crises by its inability to raise a revenue for immediate
use. Twice in the history of this country such exigencies
have arisen, and twice has Congress called upon the patriotism of its citizens to respond to the imposition of an income
tax - once in the throes of civil war, and once in the exigency
of a financial panic, scarcely less disastrous. The language of
Mr. Justice Baldwin, in Grignon's Lessee v. Astor, 2 How.
319, 343, though referring to a different class of cases, seems
to me perfectly apposite to the one under consideration.
"We do not deem it necessary, now or hereafter, to retrace
the reasons or the authorities on which the decisions of this
court in that, or the cases which preceded it, rested; they
are founded on the oldest and most sacred principles of the
common law. Time has consecrated them ; the courts of the
State have followed, and this court has never departed from

them. They are rules of property upon which the repose of
the country depends; titles acquired under the proceedings
of courts of competent jurisdiction must be deemed inviolable in collateral actions, or none can know what is his
own."

It must be admitted, however, that in none of these cases
has the question been directly presented as to what are taxes
upon land within the meaning of the constitutional provision.
Notwithstanding the authorities cited upon this point by the
Attorney General, notably, Jeffrey's Case, 5 Coke, 67; Tleed
v. Starkey, 8 Mod. 314; Case v. Sepliens, Fitzgibbon, 297;
Palmer v. Power, 4 Irish C. L. (1854) 191; and Van Rensselaer
v. Dennison, 8 Barb. 23, to the effect that a tax upon a person
with respect to his land, or the profits of his land, is not a tax
upon the land itself, I regard the doctrine as entirely well settled in this court, that a tax upon an incident to a prohibited
thing is a tax upon the thing itself, and, if there be a total
want of power to tax the thing, there is an equal want of
power to tax the incident. A summary of the cases upon this
point may not be inappropriate in this connection. Thus, in
-Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, a license tax upon an
importer was held to be invalid as a tax upon imports; in
Weston v. C]iarleston, 2 Pet. 449, a tax upon stock for loans
to the United States was held invalid as a tax upon the functions of the government; in Dobbins v. Commissioners, 16 Pet.
435, a state tax on the salary of an office invalid, as a tax
upon the office itself ; in the Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, a
tax upon alien passengers arriving in ports of the State was
held void as a tax upon commerce; in Albny v. California,
24 How. 169, a stamp tax upon bills of lading was held to be
a tax upon exports; in Crandallv. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, a tax
upon railroads and stage companies for every passenger carried
out of the State, was held to be a tax on the passenger for
the privilege of passing through the State; in Piekardv. Pullman Southern (ear Co., 117 U. S.34, a tax upon Pullman cars
running between different States was held to be bad as a tax
upon interstate commerce; and in Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U. S.
640, a similar ruling was made with regard to a license tax

for telegraph companies; and finally, in Cook v. Pennsylvaonia, 97 U. S. 566, a tax upon the sales of goods was held to
be a tax upon the goods themselves. Indeed, oases to the
same effect are almost innumerable. In the light of these
cases, I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that a tax
upon the rents or income of real estate is a tax upon the land
itself.
But this does not cover the whole question. To bring the
tax within the rule of apportionment, it must not only be a
tax upon land, but it must be a direct tax upon land. The
Constitution only requires that direct taxes be laid by the rule
of apportionment. We have held that direct taxes include
among others taxes upon land ; but it does not follow from
these premises that every tax upon land is a direct tax. A
tax upon the product of land, whether vegetable, animal, or
mineral, is in a certain sense, and perhaps within the decisions
above mentioned, a tax upon the land. "For," as Lord Coke
But it
said, "what is the land but the profits thereof?"
seems to me that it could hardly be seriously claimed that a
tax upon the crops and cattle of the farmer, or the coal and
iron of the miner, though levied upon the property while it
remained upon the land, was a direct tax upon the land. A
tax upon the rent of land in my opinion falls within the same
category. It is rather a difference in the name of the thing
taxed, than in the principle of the taxation. The rent is no
more directly the outgrowth or profit of the land than the
crops or the coal, and a direct tax upon either is only an indirect tax upon the land. While, within the cases above cited,
it is a tax upon land' it is a direct tax only upon one of the
many profits of land, and is not only not a direct tax upon the
land itself, but is also subject to the other objection that it,
is, in its nature, incapable of apportionment according to
population.
It is true that we have often held that what cannot be done
directly cannot be done indirectly, but this applies only when
it cannot be done at all, directly or indirectly; but if it can
be done directly in one manner, i.e. by the rule of apportionment, it does not follow that it may not be done indirectly

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

693

Dissenting Opinion: Brown, J.

in another manner. There is no want of power on the part
of Congress to tax land, but in exercising that power it must
impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment. The power
still remains, however, to impose indirect taxes by the rule of
uniformity. Being of opinion that a tax upon rents is an indirect tax upon lands, I am driven to the conclusion that the
tax in question is valid.
The tax upon the income of municipal bonds falls obviously
within the other category, of an indirect tax upon something
which Congress has no right to tax at all, and hence is invalid.
Here is a question, not of the method of taxation, but of the
power to subject the property to taxation in any form. It
seems to me that the cases of Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113,
holding that it is not competent for Congress to impose a tax
upon the salary of a judicial officer of a State; McCulloch v.
-Maryland,4 Wheat. 316, holding that a State could not impose a tax upon the operation of the Bank of the United States;
and United States v. Railroad Co., 17 Wall. 322, holding that
a municipal corporation is a portion of the sovereign power of
the State, and is not subject to taxation by Congress upon its
municipal revenues; Wlisconsin Central Railroad v. Price,
133 U. S.496, holding that no State has the power to tax the
property of the United States within its limits; and Van
Brocklin, v. Tennessee, 117 U. S.151, to the same effect, apply
mutatis mutandis to the bonds in question, and the tax upon
them must, therefore, be invalid.
There is, in certain particulars, a want of uniformity in this
law, which may have created in the minds of some the impression that it was studiously designed not only to shift the
burden of taxation upon the wealthy class, but to exempt certain favored corporations from its operation. There is certainly no want of uniformity within the meaning of the
Constitution, since we have repeatedly held that the uniformity there referred to is territorial only. Loughborough v. Blake,
5 Wheat. 317; Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580. In the
words of the Constitution, the tax must be uniform "throughout the United States."
Irrespective, however, of the Constitution, a tax which is

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: Brown, J.

wanting in uniformity among members of the same class is, or
may be, invalid. But this does not deprive the legislature of
the power to make exemptions, provided such exemptions rest
upon some principle, and are not purely arbitrary, or created
solely for the purpose of favoring some person or body of
persons. Thus in every civilized country there is an exemption
of small incomes, which it would be manifest cruelty to tax,
and the power to make such exemptions once granted, the
amount is within the discretion of the legislature, and so long
as that power is not wantonly abused, the courts are bound
to respect it. In this law there is an exemption of $4000,
which indicates a purpose on the part of Congress that the
burden of this tax should fall on the wealthy, or at least upon
the well-to-do. If men who have an income or property
beyond their pressing needs are not the ones to pay taxes, it
is difficult to say who are; in other words, enlightened taxation is imposed upon property and not upon persons. Poll
taxes, formerly a considerable source of revenue, are now
practically obsolete. The exemption of $4000 is designed,
undoubtedly, to cover the actual living expenses of the large
majority of families, and the fact that it is not applied to corporations is explained by the fact that corporations have no
corresponding expenses. The expenses of earning their profits
are, of course, deducted in the same manner as the corresponding expenses of a private individual are deductible from
the earnings of his business. The moment the profits of a
corporation are paid over to the stockholders, the exemption of $4000 attaches to them in the hands of each stockholder.
The fact that savings banks and mutual insurance companies,
whose profits are paid to policy holders, are exempted, is explicable on the theory, (whether a sound one or not, I need not
stop to inquire,) that these institutions are not, in their original
conception, intended as schemes for the accumulation of money;
and if this exemption operates as an abuse in certain cases, and
with respect to certain very wealthy corporations, it is probable that the recognition of such abuses was necessary to the
exemption of the whole class.

It is difficult to overestimate the importance of these cases.
I certainly cannot overstate the regret I feel at the disposition
made of them by the court. It is never a light thing to set
aside the deliberate will of the legislature, and in my opinion
it should never be done, except upon the clearest proof of its
conflict with the fundamental law. Respect for the Constitution will not be inspired by a narrow and technical construction
which shall limit or impair the necessary powers of Congress.
Did the reversal of these cases involve merely the striking
down of the inequitable features of this law, or even the whole
law, for its want of uniformity, the consequences would be less
serious; but as it implies a declaration that every income tax
must be laid according to the rule of apportionment, the decision involves nothing less than a surrender of the taxing power
to the moneyed class. By resuscitating an argument that was
exploded in the Ilylton case, and has lain practically dormant
for a hundred years, it is made to do duty in nullifying, not
this law alone, but every similar law that is not based upon
an impossible theory of apportionment. Even the spectre of
socialism is conjured up to frighten Congress from laying taxes
upon the people in proportion to their ability to pay them.
It is certainly a strange commentary upon the Constitution
of the United States and upon a democratic government that
Congress has no power to lay a tax which is one of the main
sources of revenue of nearly every civilized State. It is a confession of feebleness in which I find myself wholly unable to
join.
While I have no doubt that Congress will find some means
of surmounting the present crisis, my fear is that in some moment of national peril this decision will rise up to frustrate its
will and paralyze its arm. I hope it may not prove the first
step toward the submergence of the liberties of the people in
a sordid despotism of wealth.
As I cannot escape the conviction that the decision of the
court in this great case is fraught with immeasurable danger
to the future of the country, and that it approaches the proportions of a national calamity, I feel it a duty to enter my
protest against it.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

MR.

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

JUSTICE JACKSON

dissenting.

I am unable to yield my assent to the judgment of the
court in these cases. My strength has not been equal to the
task of preparing a formal dissenting opinion since the decision was ageed upon. I concur fully in the dissents expressed
by Mr. Justice White on the former hearing and by the Justices who will dissent now, and will only add a brief outline
of my views upon the main questions presented and decided.
It is not and cannot be denied that, under the broad and
comprehensive taxing power conferred by the Constitution on
the national government, Congress has the authority to tax
incomes from whatsoever source arising, whether from real
estate or personal property or otherwise. It is equally clear
that Congress, in the exercise of this authority, has the discretion to impose the tax upon incomes above a designated amount.
The underlying and controlling question now presented is,
whether a tax on incomes received from land and personalty
is a "direct tax," and subject to the rule of apportionment.
The decision of the court, holding the income tax law of
August, 1894, void, is based upon the following propositions:
First. That a tax upon real and personal property is a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution, and, as such,
in order to be valid, must be apportioned among the several
States according to their respective populations. Second.
That the incomes derived or realized from such property are
an inseparable incident thereof, and so far partake of the
nature of the property out of which they arise as to stand
upon the same footing as the property itself. From these
premises the conclusion is reached that a tax on incomes arising
from both real and personal property is a "direct tax," and
subject to the same rule of apportionment as a tax laid directly
on the property itself, and not being so imposed by the act of
1894, according to the rule of numbers, is unconstitutional and
void. Third. That the invalidity of the tax on incomes from
real and personal property being established, the remaining
portions of the income tax law are also void, notwithstanding
the fact that such remaining portions clearly come within tho

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

697

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

class of taxes designated as duties or excises in respect to
which the rule of apportionment has no application, but which
are controlled and regulated by the rule of uniformity.
It is not found, and could not be properly found by the
court, that there is in the other provisions of the law any such
lack of uniformity as would be sufficient to render these remaining provisions void for that reason. There is, therefore, no essential connection between the class of incomes which the court
holds to be within the rule of apportionment and the other class
falling within the rule of uniformity, and I cannot understand
the principle upon which the court reaches the conclusion that,
because one branch of the law is invalid for the reason that the
tax is not laid by the rule of apportionment, it thereby defeats
and invalidates another branch resting upon the rule of uniformity, and in respect to which there is no valid objection.
If the conclusion of the court on this third proposition is sound,
the principle upon which it rests could with equal propriety
be extended to the entire revenue act of August, 1894.
I shall not dwell upon these considerations. They have
been fully elaborated by Mr. Justice Harlan. There is just as
much room for the assumption that Congress would not have
passed the customs branches of the law without the provision
taxing incomes from real and personal estate, as that they
would not have passed the provision relating to incomes resting upon the rule of uniformity. Unconstitutional provisions
of an act will, no doubt, sometimes defeat constitutional provisions where they are so essentially and inseparably connected
in substance as to prevent the enforcement of the valid part
without giving effect to the invalid portion. But when the
valid and the invalid portions of the act are not mutually
dependent upon each other as considerations, conditions, or
compensation for each other, and the valid portions are
capable of separate enforcement, the latter are never, especially in revenue laws, declared void because of invalid portions of the law.
The rule is illustrated in numerous decisions of this court
and of the highest courts of the States. Take the State Freight
Tax Cases, 15 Wall. 232. There was a single act imposing a

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

tonnage tax upon all railroads, on all freight transported by
them. The constitutionality of the law was attacked on the
ground that it applied not merely to freight carried wholly
within the State, but extended to freight received without and
brought into the State, and to that received within and carried
beyond the limits of the State, which came within the interstate commerce provision of the Constitution of the United
States. This court held the tax invalid as to this latter 'class
of freight; but, being valid as to the internal freight, that
much of the law could not be defeated by the invalid part,
although the act imposing the tax was single and entire. To
the same effect are the cases of Huntington v. Worthen, 120
U. S. 97; Allen v. _Louisiana, 103 U. S.80; ]2atterman v.
Western Union Telegraph Co., 127 U. S.411 (where the point
was directly made that the invalid part should defeat the
valid part); and Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 696, 697. In
this last case this court said: "Unless it be impossible to avoid
it, a general revenue statute should never be declared inoperative in all its parts because a particular part relating to a distinct subject-matter may be invalid. A different rule might
be disastrous to the financial operations of the government
and produce the utmost confusion in the business of the entire
country."
Here the distinction between the two branches of the income
tax law are entirely separable. They rest upon different rules;
one part can be enforced without the other, and to hold that
the alleged invalid portion, if invalid, should break down the
valid portion, is a proposition which I think entirely erroneous,
and wholly unsupported either upon principle or authority.
In considering the question whether a tax on incomes from
real or personal estate is a direct tax within the meaning
of those words as employed in the Constitution, I shall not
enter upon any discussion of the decisions of this court, commencing with the Ilylton case in 1796 (3 Dall. 171), and ending with the Springer case in 1880 (102 U. S. 507) ; nor shall
I dwell upon the approval of those decisions by the great lawwriters of the country and by all the commentators on the
Constitution; nor will I dwell upon the long-continued prac-

tice of the government in compliance with the principle laid
down in those decisions. They, in my judgment, settle and
conclude the question now before the court, contrary to tho
present decision. But, if they do not settle they certainly
raise such a doubt on the subject as should restrain the court
from declaring the act unconstitutional. No rule of construction is better settled than that this court will not declare
invalid a statute passed by a coordinate branch of the government, in whose favor every presumption should be made,
unless its repugnancy to the Constitution is clear beyond a
reasonable doubt. In Ogden v. Saunders,12 Wheat. 213, this
court said that the mere fact of a doubt was sufficient to prevent the court from declaring the act unconstitutional, and
that language in substance is repeated in the Sinking Fund
Cases, 99 U. S. 700, where the opinion of the court was given
by Chief Justice Waite, who said the act must be beyond all
reasonable doubt unconstitutional before this court would so.
declare it.
It seems to me the court in this case adopts a wrong method
of arriving at the true meaning of the words "direct tax" as
employed in the Constitution. It attaches too much weight
and importance to detached expressions of individuals and
writers on political economy, made subsequent to the adoption
of the Constitution, and who do not, in fact; agree upon any
definition of a "direct tax." From such sources we derive no
real light upon the subject. To ascertain the true meaning of
the words "direct tax" or "direct taxes" we should have
regard not merely to the words themselves, but to the connection in which they are used in the Constitution and to the
conditions and circumstances existing when the Constitution.
was formed and adopted. What were the surrounding circumstances? I shall refer to them very briefly. The only subject
of direct taxation prevailing at the time was land. The States
did tax some articles of personal property, but such property
was not the subject of general taxation by valuation or assessment. Land and its appurtenances was the principal object of
taxation in all the States. By theVIIIth Article of the Confederation the expenses of the government were to be borne out

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

of a common treasury, to be supplied by the States according
to the value of the granted and surveyed lands in each State,
such valuation to be estimated or the assessment to be made
by the Congress in such mode as they should from time to
time determine. This was a direct tax directly laid upon the
value of all the real estate in the country. The trouble with
it was that the Confederation had no power of enforcing its
assessment. All it could do, after arriving at the assessment
or estimate, was to make its requisitions upon the several
States for their respective quotas. They were not met. This
radical defect in the Confederation had to be remedied in the
new Constitution, which accordingly gave to the national
government the power of imposing taxation directly upon all
.citizens or inhabitants of the country, and to enforce such
taxation without the agency or instrumentality of the States.
The framers of the Constitution knew that land was the
general object of taxation in all the States. They found no
fault with the VIIIth Article of the Confederation so far as it
imposed taxation on the value of land and the appurtenances
thereof in each State.
Now it may reasonably and properly be assumed that the
framers of the Constitution in adopting the rule of apportionment, according to the population of the several States, had
reference to subjects or objects of taxation of universal or
general distribution throughout all the States. A capitation
or poll tax had its subject in every State, and was, so to speak,
self-apportioning according to numbers. "Other direct tax"
used in connection with such capitation tax must have been
intended to refer to subjects having like, or approximate,
relation to numbers, and found in all the States. It never
was contemplated to reach by direct taxation subjects of
partial distribution. What would be thought of a direct tax
and the apportionment thereof laid upon cotton at so much a
bale, upon tobacco at so much a hogshead, upon rice at so
much a ton or a tierce? Would not the idea of apportioning
that tax on property, non-existing in a majority of the States,
be utterly frivolous and absurd?
Not only was land the subject of general distributions, but

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

evidently in the minds of the framers of the Constitution from
the fact that it was the subject of taxation under the Confederation. But at the time of the adoption of the Constitution there was, with the single exception of a partial income
tax in the State of Delaware, no general tax on incomes in
this country nor in any State thereof. Did the framers of the,
Constitution look forward into the future so as to contemplate
and intend to cover such a tax as was then unknown to them?
I think not.
It was ten or eleven years after the adoption of the Constitution before the English government passed her first
income tax law under the leadership of Mr. Pitt. The question then arose, to which the Chief Justice has referred,
whether, in estimating income, you could look or have any
regard to the source from which it sprung. That question
was material, because, by the English loan acts it was provided that the public dividends should be paid "free of any
tax or charge whatever," and Mr. Pitt was confronted with
the question on his income tax law whether he proposed to
reach or could reach income from those stocks. ie said the
words must receive a reasonable interpretation, and that
the true construction was that you should not look at all to.
the nature of the source, but that you should consider dividends, for the purpose of the income tax, simply in the relation
to the receiver as so much income. This construction was
adopted and put in practice for over fifty years without question. In 1853 Mr. Gladstone, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
resisting with all his genius the effort to make important
changes of the income tax, said, in a speech before the House.
of Commons, that the construction of Mr. Pitt was undoubtedly correct. These opinions of distinguished statesmen may
not have the force of judicial authority, but they show what
men of eminence and men of ability and distinction thought
of the income tax at its original inception.
If the assumption I have made that the framers of the Constitution in providing for the apportionment of a direct tax
had in iind a subject-matter or subjects-matter, which had
some general distribution among the States is correct, it is

clear that a tax on incomes - a subject not of general distribution at that time or since - is not a "direct tax" in the
sense of the Constitution.
The framers of the Constitution proceeded upon the theory
entertained by all political writers of that day, that there was
some relation, more or less direct, between population and
land. But there is no connection, direct or proximate, between rents of land and incomes of personalty and population--none whatever. They did not have any relation to
each other at the time the Constitution was adopted, nor have
they ever had since, and perhaps never will have.
Again, it is settled by well-considered authorities that a
tax on rents and a tax on land itself is not duplicate or double
taxation. The authorities in England and in this country
hold that a tax on rents and a tax on land are different things.
Besides the English cases, to which I have not the time or
strength to refer, there is the well-considered case of Riobinson
v. The County of Allegheny, 7 Penn. St. 161, when Gibson
was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
holding that a tax on rent is not a tax on the land out of
which it arises. In that case there was a lea8e in, fee of certain premises, the lessee covenanting to pay all taxes on the
demised premises. A tax was laid by the State upon both land
and rent, and the question arose whether the tenant, even
under that express covenant, was bound to pay the tax on
the land itself. The Supreme Court of the State held that
he was not; that there were two separate, distinct, and independent subjects-matter; and that his covenant to pay on the
demised premises did not extend to the payment of the tax
charged upon the rent against the land owner. All the circumstances surrounding the formation and adoption of the Constitution lead to the conclusion that only such tax as is laid
directly upon property as such, according to valuation or
assessment, is a "direct tax" within the true meaning of the
Constitution.
Again, we cannot attribute to the framers of the Constitution an intention to make any tax a direct tax which it was
impossible to apportion. If it cannot be apportioned without

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

gross injustice, we may feel assured that it is a tax never contemplated by the Constitution as a direct tax. No tax, therefore, can be regarded as a direct tax, in the sense of that
instrument, which is incapable of apportionment by the rule
of numbers. The constitutional provision clearly implies in
the requirement of apportionment that a direct tax is such,
and such only, as can be apportioned without glaring inequality,
manifest injustice, and unfairness as between those subject to
its burden. The most natural and practical test by which to
determine what is a direct tax in the sense of the Constitution
is to ascertain whether the tax can be apportioned among the
several States according to their respective numbers, with reasonable approximation to justice, fairness, and equality to all
the citizens and inhabitants of the country who may be subject to the operation of the law. The fact that a tax cannot
be so apportioned without producing gross injustice and
inequality among those required to pay it should settle the
question that it was not a direct tax within the true sense and
meaning of those words as they are used in the Constitution.
Let us apply this test. Take the illustration suggested in
the opinion of the court. Congress lays a tax of thirty millions
upon the incomes of the country above a certain designated
amount, and directs that tax to be apportioned among the
several States according to their numbers, and when so apportioned to be pro-rated amongst the citizens of the respective
States coming within the operation of the law. To two States
of equal population the same amount will be allotted. In
one of these States there are 1000 individuals and in the other
2000 subject to the tax. The former under the operation of
the apportionment will be required to pay twice the rate of the
latter on the same amount of income. This disparity and
inequality will increase just in proportion as the numbers subject to the tax in the different States differ or vary. By way
of further illustration, take the new State of Washington and
the old State of Rhode Island, having about the same population. To each would be assigned the same amount of the
general assessment. In the former, we will say, there are
5000 citizens subject to the operation of the law, in the latter

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

50,000. The citizen of Washington will be required to pay ten
times as much as the citizen of Rhode Island on the sanme
amount of taxable income. Extend the rule to all the States,
and the result is that the larger the number of those subject
to the operation of the law in any given State, the smaller
their proportion of the tax and the smaller their rate of taxation, while, in respect to the smaller number in other States,
the greater will be their rate of taxation on the same income.
But it is said that this inequality was intentional upon the
part of the framers of the Constitution ; that it was adopted
with a view to protect property owners as a class. Where
does such an idea find support or countenance under a Constitution framed and adopted "to promote justice? " The government is not dealing with the States in this matter; it is
dealing with its own citizens throughout the country, irrespective of state lines, and to say that the Constitution, which was
intended to promote peace and justice, either in its whole or in
any part thereof, ever intended to work out such a result, and
produce such gross discrimination and injustice between the
citizens of a common country, is beyond all reason.
What is to be the end of the application of this new rule
adopted by the court? A tax is laid by the general government on all the money on hand or on deposit of every citizen
of the government at a given date. Such taxation prevails
in many of the States. The government has, under its taxing
power, the right to lay such a tax. When laid a few parties
come before the court and say: "My deposits were derived
from the proceeds of farm products or from the interest on
bonds and securities, and they are not, therefore, taxable by
this law." To make your tax valid you must apportion the
tax amongst all the citizens of the government, according to
the population of the respective States, taking the whole
subject-matter out of the control of Congress, both the rate
of taxation and the assessment, and imposing it upon the
people of the country by an arbitrary rule which produces
such inequality as I have briefly pointed out.
In my judgment the principle announced in the decision
practically destroys the power of the government to reach

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

705

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, J.

incomes from real and personal estate. There is to my mind
little or no real difference between denying the existence of
the power to tax incomes from real and personal estate, and
attaching such conditions and requirements to its exercise as
will render it impossible or incapable of any practical operation. You might just as well in this case strike at the
power to reach incomes from the sources indicated as to
attach these conditions of apportionment which no legislature can ever undertake to adopt, and which, if adopted,
cannot be enforced with any degree of equality or fairness
between the common citizens of a common country.
The decision disregards the well-established canon of construction to which I have referred, that an act passed by a
coirdinate branch of the government has every presumption
in its favor, and should never be declared invalid by the courts
unless its repugnancy to the Constitution is clear beyond all
reasonable doubt. It is not a matter of conjecture; it is the
established principle that it must be clear beyond a reasonable
doubt. I cannot see, in view of the past, how this case can
be said to be free of doubt.
Again, the decision not only takes from Congress its rightful power of fixing the rate of taxatior., but substitutes a
rule incapable of application without producing the most monstrous inequality and injustice between citizens residing in different sections of their, common country, such as the framers
of the Constitution never could have contemplated, such as
no free and enlightened people can ever possibly sanction or
approve.
The practical operation of the decision is not only to disregard the great principles of equality in taxation, but the further
principle that in the imposition of taxes for the benefit of the
government the burdens thereof should be imposed upon those
having most ability to bear them. This decision, in effect,
works out a directly opposite result, in relieving the citizens
having the greater ability, while the burdens of taxation are
made to fall most heavily and oppressively upon those having
the least ability. It lightens the burden upon the larger number, in some States subject to the tax, and places it most unVOL. cLVIII-45

equally and disproportionately on the smaller number in other
States. Considered in all its bearings, this decision is, in my
judgment, the most disastrous blow ever struck at the constitutional power of Congress. It strikes down an important
portion of the most vital and essential power of the government in practically excluding any recourse to incomes from
real and personal estate for the purpose of raising needed revenue to meet the government's wants and necessities under
any circumstances.
I am therefore compelled to enter my dissent to the judgment of the court.
MR. JUSTICE

WITE

dissenting.

I deem it unnecessary to elaborate my reasons for adhering
to the views hitherto expressed by me, and content myself
with the following statement of points:
1st. The previous opinion of the court held that the inclusion of rentals from real estate in income subject to taxation
laid a direct tax on the real estate itself, and was, therefore,
unconstitutional and void, unless apportioned. From this position I dissented, on the ground that it overthrew the settled
construction of the Constitution, as applied in one hundred
years of practice, sanctioned by the repeated and unanimous
decisions of this court, and taught by every theoretical and
philosophical writer on the Constitution who has expressed an
opinion upon the subject.
2d. The court in its present opinion considers that the Constitution requires it to extend the former ruling yet further,
and holds that the inclusion of revenue from personal property
in an income subjected to taxation amounts to imposing a direct
tax on the personal property, which is also void, unless apportioned. As a tax on income from real and personal property
is declared to be unconstitutional unless apportioned, because
it is equivalent to a direct tax on such property, it follows that
the decision now rendered holds not only that the rule of apportionment must be applied to an income tax, but also that no tax,
whether direct or indirect, on either real and personal property
or investments can be levied unless by apportionment. Every-

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

thing said in the dissent from the previous decision applies to the
ruling now announced, which, I think, aggravates and accentuates the court's departure from the settled construction of
the Constitution.
3d. The court does not now, except in some particulars, review the reasoning advanced in support of its previous conclusion, and therefore the opinion does not render it necessary for
me to do more than refer to the views expressed in my former
dissent, as applicable to the position now taken and then to
briefly notice the new matter advanced.
4th. As, however, on the rehearing, the issues have been
elaborately argued, I deem it also my duty to state why the
reargument has in no way shaken, but on the contrary has
strengthened, the convictions hitherto expressed.
. 5th. The reasons urged on the reargument seem to me to
involve a series of contradictory theories:
a. Thus, in answering the proposition that United States v.
lylton and the cases which followed and confirmed it, have
settled that the word "direct," as used in the Constitution,
applies only to capitation taxes and taxes on land, it is first
contended that this claim is unfounded, and that nothing of
the kind was so decided, and it is then argued that "a century
of error" should furnish no obstacle to the reversal, by this
court, of a continuous line of decisions interpreting the constitutional meaning of that word, if such decisions be considered
wrong. Whence the "century of error" is evolved, unless the
cases relied on, decided that the word "direct" was not to be
considered in its economic sense, does not appear from the
argument.
b. In answer to the proposition that the passage of the
carriage-tax act and the decision in the Hiylton case which
declared that act constitutional, involved the assumption
that the word "direct" in the Constitution was to be considered as applying only to a tax on land and capitation, it
is said that this view of the act and decision is faulty, and,
therefore, the inference deduced from it is erroneous. At the
same time reference is made to the opinion of Mr. Madison,
that the carriage-tax act was passed in violation of the Consti-

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

tution, and hence that the decision which held it constitutional
was wrong. How that distinguished statesman could have
considered that the act violated the Constitution, and how
he could have regarded the decision which affirmed its validity
as erroneous, unless the act and decision were not in accord
with his view of the meaning of the word "direct , the argument also fails to elucidate.
6th. Attention was previously called to the fact that practically all the theoretical and philosophical writers on the Constitution, since the carriage-tax act was passed and the Ifylton
case was decided, have declared that the word "direct" in
the Constitution applies only to taxes on land and capitation
taxes. The list of writers, formerly referred to, with the
addition of a few others not then mentioned, includes Kent,
Story, Cooley, Miller, Bancroft, the historian of the Constitution, Porneroy, Hare, Burroughs, Ordroneaux, Black, Farrar,
Flanders,, Bateman, Patterson, and Von Holst. How is this
overwhelming consensus of publicists, of law writers, and historians answered?. By saying that their opinions ought not
to be regarded, because they were all misled by the dicta in the
-Iylton case into teaching an erroneous doctrine. How, if the
Hlylton case did not decide this question of direct taxation, it
could have misled all these writers-among them some of
the noblest and brightest intellects which have adorned our
national life - is not explained. In other words, in order to
escape the effect of the act and of the decision upon it, it is
argued that they did not, by necessary implication, establish
that direct taxes were only land and capitation taxes, and in
the same breath, in order to avoid the force of the harmonious
interpretation of the Constitution by all the great writers
who have expounded it, we are told that their views are
worthless because they were misled by the lylton case.
7th. If, as is admitted, all these authors have interpreted
the Iylton case as confining direct taxes to land and capitation
taxes, I submit that their unanimity, instead of affording
foundation for the argument that they were misled by that
case, furnishes a much better and safer guide as to what its
decision necessarily implied, than does the contention now

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

709

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

made, unless we are to hold that all these great minds were
so feeble as to be led into concluding that the case decided
what it did not decide, and unless we are to say that the true
light in regard to the meaning of this word "direct" has'
come to no writer or thinker from that time until now.
8th. Whilst it is admitted that in the discussions at the
bar of this court in years past, when the previous cases were
before it, copious reference was made to the lines of authority
here advanced, and that nothing new is now urged, we are,
at the same time, told that, strange as it may seem, the sources
of the Constitution have been "neglected" up to the present
time; and this supposed neglect is asserted in order to justify
the overthrow of an interpretation of the Constitution concluded by enactments and decisions dating from the foundation of the government. how this neglect of the sources of
the Constitution in the past is compatible with the admission
that nothing new is here advanced, is not explained.
9th. Although the opinions of Kent, Story, Cooley, and all
the other teachers and writers on the Constitution are here
disregarded in determining the constitutional meaning of the
word "direct," the opinions of some of the same authors are
cited as conclusive on other questions involved in this case.
Why the opinions of these great men should be treated as
"worthless" in regard to one question of constitutional law,
and considered conclusive on another, remains to be discovered.
10th. The same conflict of positions is presented in other
respects. Thus, in support of various views upon incidental
questions, we are referred to many opinions of this court as
conclusive, and, at the same time, we are told that all the
decisions of this court from the Hylton ecase down to the
Springer case in regard to direct taxation are wrong if they
limit the word "direct" to land and capitation, and must,
therefore, be disregarded, because "a century of error" does
not suffice to determine a question. How the decisions of
this court settling one principle are to be cited as authority
for that principle, and, at the same time, it is to be argued,
that other decisions, equally unanimous and concurrent, are

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

no authority for another principle, involves a logical dilemma;
which cannot be solved.
11th. In dissenting before, it was contended that the passage of the carriage-tax act and the decision of this court
thereon had been accepted by the Legislative and Executive
branches of the government from that time to this, and that
this acceptance had been manifested by conforming all taxes
thereafter imposed to the rule of taxation thus established.
This is answered by saying that there was no such acceptance, because the mere abstention from the exercise of a
power affords no indication of an intention to disown the
power. The fallacy here consists in confusing action with
inaction. It was not reasoned in the previous dissent that
mere inaction implied the lack of a governmental power, but
that the definitive action in a particular way, when construed
in connection with the Iylton decision, established a continuous governmental interpretation.
12th. Whilst denying that there has been any rule evolved
from the _Hylton case and applied by the government for the
past hundred years, it is said that the results of that case were
always disputed when enforced. How there could be no rule,
and yet the results of the rule could be disputed, is likewise a
difficulty which is not answered.
13th. The admission of the dispute was necessitated by the
statement that when, in 1861, it was proposed to levy a direct
tax, by apportionment, on personal property, a committee of
the House of Representatives reported that under the JIylton
case it could not be done. This fact, if accurately stated, furnishes the best evidence of the existence of the rule which the
H[ylton case bad established, and shows that the decision now
made reverses that case, and sustains the contention of the
minority who voted against the carriage-tax act, and whose
views were defeated in its passage and repudiated in the
decision upon it, and have besides been overthrown by the
unbroken history of the government and by all the other
adjudications of this court confirming the Iylton case.
14th. The decision here announced holding that the tax on
the income from real estate and the tax on the income from

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

711

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

personal property and investments are direct, and therefore
require apportionment, rests necessarily on the proposition
that the word "direct" in the Constitution must be construed
in the economic sense; that is to say, whether a tax be direct
or indirect is to be tested by ascertaining whether it is capable of being shifted from the one who immediately pays it to
an ultimate consumer. If it cannot be so shifted, it is direct;
if it can be, it is indirect. But the word in this sense applies
not only to the income from real estate and personal property,
but also to business gains, professional earnings, salaries, and
all of the many sources from which human activity evolves
profit or income without invested capital. These latter the
opinion holds to be taxable without apportionment, upon the
theory that taxes on them are "excises," and, therefore, do
not require apportionment according to the previous decisions
of this court on the subject of income taxation. These decisions, Hyltion v. United States, 3 Dall. 171; Pacific Insurance
Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433; Veazie Bank v. Tyenno, 8 Wall.
533; Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331; Springer v. United States,
102 U. S. 586, hold that the word "direct" in the Constitution
refers only to direct taxes on land, and therefore has a constitutional significance wholly different from the sense given to
that word by the economists. The ruling now announced
overthrows all these decisions. It also subverts the economic
signification of the word "direct" which it seemingly adopts.
Under that meaning, taxes on business gains, professional
earnings, and salaries are as much direct, and, indeed, even
more so, than would be taxes on invested personal property.
It follows, I submit, that the decision now rendered accepts a
rule and at once in part overthrows it. In other words, the
necessary result of the conclusion is to repudiate the decisions
of this court, previously rendered, on the ground that they
misinterpreted the word "direct," by not giving it its economic sense, and then to decline to follow the economic sense
because of the previous decisions. Thus the adoption of the
economic meaning of the word destroys the decisions, and
they in turn destroy the rule established. It follows, it seems
to me, that the conclusion now announced rests neither upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Rehearing.

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

the economic sense of the word "direct" or the constitutional
significance of that term. But it must rest upon one or the
other to be sustained. Resting on neither, it has, to my
mind, no foundation in reason whatever.
15th. This contradiction points in the strongest way to
what I conceive to be the error of changing, at this late day,
a settled construction of the Constitution. It demonstrates, I
think, how conclusively the previous cases have determined
every question involved in this, and shows that the doctrine
cannot be now laid down that the word " direct" in the Constitution is to be interpreted in the economic sense, and be
consistently maintained.
16th. The injustice of the conclusion points to the error of
adopting it. It takes invested wealth and reads it into the
Constitution as a favored and protected class of property,
which cannot be taxed without apportionment, whilst it leaves
the occupation of the minister, the doctor, the professor, the
lawyer, the inventor, the author, the merchant, the mechanic,
and all other forms of industry upon which the prosperity of
a people must depend, subject to taxation without that condition. A rule which works out this result, which, it seems to
me, stultifies the Constitution by making it an instrument of
the most grievous wrong, should not be adopted, especially
when, in order to do so, the decisions of this court, the opinions of the law writers and publicists, tradition, practice,
and the settled policy of the government must be overthrown.
17th. Nor is the wrong, which this conclusion involves,
mitigated by the contention that the doctrine of apportionment now here applied to indirect as well as direct taxes on
all real estate, and invested personal property, leaves the
government with ample power to reach such property by
taxation, and make it bear its just part of the public burdens.
On the contrary, instead of doing this, it really deprives the
government of the ability to tax such property at all, because
the tax, it is now held, must be imposed by the rule of apportionment according to population. The absolute inequality
and injustice of taxing wealth by reference to population and

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.

713

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

without regard to the amount of the wealth taxed are so
manifest that this system should not be extended beyond the
settled rule which confines it to direct taxes on real estate.
To destroy the fixed interpretation of the Constitution, by
which the rule of apportionment according to population, is
confined to direct taxes on real estate so as to make that rule
include indirect taxes on real estate and taxes, whether direct
or indirect, on invested personal property, stocks, bonds, etc.,
reads into the Constitution the most flagrantly unjust, unequal,
and wrongful system of taxation known to any civilized
government. This strikes me as too clear for argument. I
can conceive of no greater injustice than would result from
imposing on one million of people in one State, having only
ten millions of invested wealth, the same amount of tax as
that imposed on the like number of people in another State
having fifty times that amount of invested wealth. The application of the rule of apportionment by population to
invested personal wealth would not only work out this wrong,
but would ultimately prove a self-destructive process, from the
facility with which such property changes its situ. If so
taxed, all property of this character would soon be transferred
to the States where the sum of accumulated wealth was greatest in proportion to population, and where therefore the
burden of taxation would be lightest, and thus the mighty
wrong resulting from the very nature of the extension of the
rule would be aggravated. It is clear then, I think, that the
admission of the power of taxation in regard to invested personal property, coupled with the restriction that the tax must
be distributed by population and not by wealth, involves a
substantial denial of the power itself, because the condition
renders its exercise practically impossible. To say a thing can
only be done in a way which must necessarily bring about
the grossest wrong,' is to delusively admit the existence of
the power, while substantially denying it. And the grievous
results sure to follow from any attempt to adopt such a
system are so obvious that my mind cannot fail to see that if
a tax on invested personal property were imposed by the rule
of population, and there were no other means of preventing

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.

its enforcement, the red spectre of revolution would shake our
institutions to their foundation.
18th. This demonstrates the fallacy of the proposition that
the interpretation of the Constitution now announced concedes
to the national government arhple means to sustain itself by
taxation in an extraordinary emergency. It leaves only the
tariff or impost, excise taxation, and the direct or indirect
taxes on the vital energies of the country, which, as I have
said, the opinion now holds are not subject to the rule of
apportionment. In case of foreign war, embargo, blockade,
or other international complications, the means of support
from tariff taxation would disappear ; none of the accumulated
invested property of the country could be reached, except
according to the impracticable rule of apportionment; and
even indirect taxation on real estate would be unavailable,
for the opinion now announces that the rule of apportionment
applies to an indirect as well as a direct tax on such property.
The government would thus be practically deprived of the
means of support.
19th. The claim that the States may pay the amount of the
apportioned tax and thus save the injustice to their citizens
resulting from its enforcement, does not render the conclusion
less hurtful. In the first place, the fact that the State may
pay the sum apportioned in no way lessens the evil, because
the tax, being assessed by population and not by wealth, must,
however paid, operate the injustice which I have just stated.
Moreover, the contention that a State could by payment of
the whole sum of a tax on personal property, apportioned
according to population, relieve the citizen from grievous
wrong to result from its enforcement against his property, is
an admission that the collection of such tax against the
property of the citizen, because of its injustice, would be
practically impossible. If substantially impossible of enforcement against the citizen's property, it would be equally so as
against the State, for there would be no obligation on the
State to pay, and thus there would be no power whatever to
enforce. Hence, the decision now rendered, so far as taxing
real and personal property and invested wealth is concerned,

POLLOCK v. FARMERS' LOAN & TRUST CO.
Rehearing.

715

Dissenting Opinion: White, J.

reduces the government of the United States to the paralyzed condition which existed under the Confederation, and
to remove which the Constitution of the United States was
adopted.
20th. The suggestion that if the construction now adopted,
by the court, brings about hurtful results, it can be cured by
an amendment to the Constitution instead of sustaining the
conclusion reached, shows its fallacy. The Hlylton case was
decided more than one hundred years ago. The income tax
laws of the past were enacted also years ago. At the time
they were passed, the debates and reports conclusively show
that they were made to conform to the rulings in the iylgon
case.
Since all these things were done, the Constitution
has been repeatedly amended. These amendments followed
the civil war, and were adopted for the purpose of supplying
defects in the national power. Can it be doubted that if an
intimation had been conveyed that the decisions of this court
would or could be overruled, so as to deprive the government
of an essential power of taxation, the amendments would have
rendered such a change of ruling impossible ? The adoption
of the amendments, none of which repudiated the uniform
policy of the government, was practically a ratification of
that policy and an acquiescence in the settled rule of interpretation theretofore adopted.
21st. It is, I submit, greatly to .be deplored that, after more
than one hundred years of our national existence, after the
government has withstood the strain of foreign wars and the
dread ordeal of civil strife, and its people have become united
and powerful, this court should consider itself compelled to
go back to a long repudiated and rejected theory of the Constitution, by which the government is deprived of an inherent
attribute of its being, a necessary power of taxation.
