with the Constitution of the United States; and that upon
these grounds (which are substantially those taken by Chief
Justice Alvey below) the judgment of the Court of Appeals,
quashing the writ of certiorari to the justice of the peace, must

claim of Hof against the Capital Traction Company open to
be tried by a jury before the justice of the peace, and, after
his judgment upon their verdict, to be taken by appeal to the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and to be there
tried by jury on the demand of eitfier party.

appellate court.
