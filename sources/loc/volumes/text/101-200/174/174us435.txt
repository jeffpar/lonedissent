Third Yational Bank of Louisville v. Stone, Auditor, ante, 432, followed in

YR. JUSTICE WHITE:

delivered the opinion of the coirt.

The appellee, the Third National Bank, filed its bill to
enjoin the collection of certain taxes, relying upon grounds in
all respects like unto those alleged in case No. 404, ante, p.
432. There was, however, this difference between the facts
of the latter case and those arising on this record: In this case
the taxes sought to be enjoined were levied prior to the
renewal of the charter of the bank. Because of this difference the court below concluded that the want of power to
assess and levy was conclusively established by the presumption of the thing adjudged arising from the decree of the
Court of Appeals of Kentucky, to which we have referred in
case No. 404. We need not, however, consider the question of
resjudicataupon which the court below based its conclusion,
as we have in case No. 404, just announced, held entirely
without reference to the plea of res judieata,that taxes in form
exactly like those here in question were illegal because levied
upon the property and franchise of the bank, and not upon
It
the shares o;f stock in the names of the shareholders.
follows, therefore, that the decree below which restrained the
collection of the taxes was correct, and it is therefore

Afflrmed,
