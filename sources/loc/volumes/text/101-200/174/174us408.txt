OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Kentucky Bank Tax Cases.

dend, we think the payment and receipt of a dividend under
the circumstances detailed in the question certified do not permit of its recovery back by a receiver appointed upon the subsequent insolvency of the bank.
The facts in the various English cases cited by counsel for
complainant are so entirely unlike those which exist in this
case that no useful purpose would be siibserved by a reference
to them. Not one holds that a dividend declared under such
facts as this case assumes can be recovered back in such an
action as this.
We answer the first question in the negative. The second
question relates to the jurisdiction of a court of equity over an
action of this nature. It is evident that the question was propounded to meet the case of an affirmative answer to the first
question.
In that event the second would require an answer. As we
answer the first question in the negative and the second question was scarcely touched upon in the argument, we think it
unnecessary to answer it in order to'enable the court below to
proceed to judgment in the case.
The first question will be certified in the negative.
