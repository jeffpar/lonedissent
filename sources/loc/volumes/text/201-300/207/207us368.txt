of the proceedings for the establishment of Elmira street by
the board of trustees of the town of Myler, as an inducement
to and consideration for entering into the compromise agreement pleaded, and that said contract having been legally
executed and not rescinded, the railway company was thereby
absolved from the duty declared upon, to construct and maintain a grade crossing at the point in controversy. 'A single
paragraph of answer cannot perform the double function of
denying the cause of action, and confessing and avoiding it.
It must be one thing or the other, but it cannot be both; and
its character, in this respect, must be determined from the
general scope of its averments.' Kimble v. Christie, 55 Indiana,
140, 144. The return under consideration. was intended to
confess and avoid the duty sought to be enforced, and its
sufficiency must be determined upon that theory. This conclusion forbids a discussion of the legality of the various steps
taken in the proceedings to establish Elmira street, as well as
the constitutional question raised."
We think it must be held that the decision by the Supreme
Court of the State was placed upon a sufficient non-Federal
ground, and therefore the writ of error is
Dismissed.

PARAISO v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE
No. 23.

ISLANDS.

Submitted December 2, 1907.-Decided December 16, 1907.

Where a case is brought up from the Circuit Court on the ground that the
construction or application of the Constitution of the United States is involved, the record must show that the question was raised for the consideration of the court below; and, under ยง 10 of the act of July 1, 1902,
32 Stat. 695, this rule applies to writs of error to review judgments of the
Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands.
A complaint, sufficiently clear to the mind of a person of rudimentary intelligence as to what it charges the defendant with, informs the accused
of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and a conviction

thereunder is not in that respect without due process of law under the
Philippine bill of rights.
A motion for rehearing in the lower court on grounds set out in the assignment of error, but which was denied, cannot be relied on as properly
raising 'the Federal question necessary to give this court jurisdiction.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Aldis B. Broune and Mr. Alexander Britton, for plaintiff
in error.
The Solicitor General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Russell, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error was convicted of falsification of documents, under Article 300, clauses 4, 7 of the Philippihe Penal
Code. He brings the case here as one in which a statute of
the United States is involved, under the act of July 1, 1902,
c. 1369, ยง 10, 32 Stat. 695. By the article mentioned a public
official is subjected to imprisonment and fine if he commits
a falsification,. clause 4, "By perverting the truth in the narration of facts," or, clause 7, "By giving out an authentic copy
of a fictitious document, or by stating therein a contrary or
different thing from that contained in the genuire original:'
It is assigned as error that the plaintiff in error was required
to answer without being advised of the nature and cause. of
the accusation against him, and that he was convicted without due process of law. It is argued further, although not
assigned as error, that the sentence inflicted a cruel and unusual punishment, by reason of the amount of the fine and the
length of the term of imprisonment, and still further, that the
fine was greater than that which the statute imposed, all
contrary to the Philippine bill of rights. Act of July 1, 1902,
c. 1369, ยง5, 32 Stat. 691, 692.

tions were raised at any stage below, except in an agreement
of counsel that the full record showed that before any evidence
was received the plaintiff in error asked leave to withdraw his
plea of not guilty and substitute the statement that he did
not know how to plead, which was denied, and that he objected to the reception of any evidence in support of the complaint, because it was incapable of being sustained by evidence, which objection was overruled. There was a motion
for rehearing, on the grounds set out in the assignment of
error, but as the motion was denied, that cannot be relied
upon here. See McMillen v. Ferrum Mining Co., 197 U. S.
343. It would be going far in allowance for different habits
of thought and action, to treat what was done as equivalent
to a demurrer. The court below does not so interpret it, but
says that no exception was taken to the sufficiency of the
complaint. It would be going farther to treat it as setting up
the Philippine bill of rights in analogy to a claim of constitutional rights in a Circuit Court of the United States. If a
case is brought up from the Circuit Court on the ground that
it involves the construction or application of the Constitution
of the United States, the record must show that the question
was raised for the consideration of the court below. Carey v.
Houston & Texas Central Ry. Co., 150 U. S.170, 181; Ansbro
v. United States, 159 U. S.695; Cornell v. Green, 163 U. S.75,
78; Cincinnati,Hamiltoh & Dayton R. R. Co. v. Thiebaud, 177
U. S.615, 619, 620; Arkansas v. Schli.rholz, 179 U. 8. 598.
The most that could be gathered from this record is that the
plaintiff in error contended that the complaint Was bad by
the rules of criminal pleading. See Cornell v. Green, 163 U. S.
75, 79. There was no hint that he relied on the bill of rights
or contended that the complaint would not satisfy that. The
bill of rights, in all probability, was an afterthought when
everything else had failed.
Our consideration of the case properly might stop here.
But, as the rule laid down probably was not well known, we
will add that we find nothing in the errors assigned. The com-

plaint, however open it might be to criticism on demurrer,
supposing the strict rules of the old common law should be
applied, would leave no doubt in the mind of any person of
rudimentary intelligence that it meant to charge the defendant
with falsely entering on the stubs of certain specified tax
certificates smaller sums than those shown by the certificates
and actually received by him, and with altering such stubs to
lower sums, with intent of gain; (that is to say, with intent to
settle his accounts as a public 'officer on the showing that less
was due than was due in fact), contrary to Article 300, clauses 4,
6 and 7of the Penal Code. 1 If the Philippine Code had sanc1 The complaint is as follows, omitting the title, signature and verification:

treasurer of Lumbang, entered upon registration tax certificate No. 481,054,

of $6.00, and erased from the stub thereof the figures written thereon, with

the provincial treasurer, all of this with intent of gain.
That on registration tax certificate No. 481,052, issued at Lumbang on
the 31st day of May, 1904, to Francisco Guimoc, he entered the amount of
$4 as the price of the said certificate, whereas on the stub thereof he only
entered the amount of $2, thereby committing the crime of falsification of a
document, provided for and penalized under paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 of section 300 of the Penal Code. It further appears from the abstract submitted
by him that the amount received was $2.00, thus defrauding the government
to his personal advantage and gain.

tioned this form, it is extravagant to contend that the enactment would have been. void under the laws of the United
States. Yet that is a test. Seq Missouri v. Dockery, 191'U. S.
165, 171. The bill of rights for the Philippines giving the accused the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him does not fasten forever upon those islands the
inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand or accept a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of occurring to intelligence fired with
a desire to pervert.
