one account, with reference to the act of 1891 and also to that
of 1899, and we think that under the circumstances the defendants should beheld liable to account therefor as indicated.
The account should be restated by allowing credit to the
defendant of $6,500, the amount paid the attorneys as already
stated. As to all other matters, the decree is right. The proper
disposition of the case is to dismiss the appeal in No. 12, because the decree appealed from is not a final one, and to reverse
the decree in No. 388, for the purpose of making the proper
credit to defendants in the account.

The purpose of the statute of Arkansas providing that all notes given for
payment of patented articles 'must show that they were so given, and
permitting defenses to be made to such notes in the hands of third parties,
is to create and enforce a police regulation, aimed principally at itinerant
vendors of patented articles, and the distinction in ยง 4 that it shall not apply to merchants and dealers who sell patented articles in the usual course
of business is founded upon fair reasoning and is not such a discrimination
as violates the equal protection provisions "f the Fourteenth Amendment.

THIS case comes here upon certiorari directed to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The action was commenced in the United States Circuit Court for the Western
District of Arkansas, upon certain promissory notes, which
the defendant, the Ozan Lumber Company, in its answer alleged had been given by it in payment for a patented article,
such notes not being executed upon, a printed form, showing
they, were given in consideration of a patented machine, as
required by the statute of Arkansas. Sections 513 to 516, inelusive, Kirby's Digest Laws of Arkansas.
A demurrer to the defense was interposed on the ground that
it did not state facts constituting a defense. The Circuit Court
sustained the demurrer, because, as it held, the act was in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, as denying to the
plaintiff the equal protection of the laws. . 127 Fed. Rep. 206.
The case was taken by writ of error to the Circuit Court of
Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed for.the reason that
the act was an illegal (iiscrimination against patented articles.

patented articles made under that right. The latter have

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement,
.delivered the opinion of the court.
The validity of this very statut6'of Arkansas (at least until
Congress legislates upon the subject) has already been aflrmed
by this court, Woods & Sons v. Carl, 203 U. S. 358, and the
validity of-statutes of a somewhat similar nature has also been
affirmed in the case of Allen v. Riley, 203 U. S. 347, immediately
preceding the case above cited.
It is sought to avoid the authority of our decision upon this
Arkansas statute by asserting that nothing was therein decided, except the validity of the first section of the act, and that
the validity of the act when considered in connection with the
fourth section was not argued or decided. The fourth section
reads as follows: "This act shall not apply to merchants and
dealers who sell patented things in the usual course of business."
Other reasons for an affirmance are set up in the brief of respondent.
The grounds given for the decision by the Circuit Court and
the Circuit Court of Appeals differ somewhat. The Circuit
Court says that the effect of the fourth section of the statute
is to violate that portion of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Federal Constitution, which provides that no State shall

Opinion of the Court.

deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws; while the Circuit Court of Appeals bases its judgment upon the unlawful discrimination evidenced by the act
against those who are protected by a patent granted by the
United States.
In 203 U. S. 358, supra, this court held the statute valid
as against an objection of the same nature as that taken herein
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Our decision in that case had
not been made at the time of the decision of this case in -the
courts below. The .grQund taken by the Circuit Court was not
discussed in our opinion in 203 U. S. and although it might
be urged that all objections to its validity arising upon the face
of the statute, even if not specially discussed, were overruled
by the decision; yet assuming that the particular question now
presented is still open in this court, we are of opinion that the
exception contained in section four does not render the statute
invalid. The plain purpose of the whole statute is to create
and enforce a proper police regulation. Its passage showed
that the legislature was of opinion that fraud and imposition
were frequent in the sale of .property of this nature, except in
the cases mentioned in ยง 4, and that temptations to false
.representations in regard to the virtues and value of the article sold were also frequently yielded to. When the sale of
the article was effected by such representations, and a note
given for the amount of the sale, a transfer of the note to a
bona ide purchaser for value before its maturity prevented the
vendee from showing the fraud by which the sale had been
accomplished. In order to reach such a transaction and to
permit the vendee to show the fraud, the statute was passed.
It was doubtless thought that merchants and dealers, as mentioned in the statute, while dealing with the patented things
in the manner stated, would not be so likely to make representations or to engage in a fraud to effect a sale, as those covered
by the statute. The various itinerant vendors of patented
articles, whose fluency of speech and carelessness regarding the
truth of their representations, might almost be said to have

become proverbial, were, of course, in the mind of the legislature, and were included in this legislation. Indeed they are
the principal people to be affected by it.
The manufacturer of a patented article,. who also sells it in
the usual course of business in his store or factory., would
probably come within the exception of ยง 4. He may be
none the less a dealer, selling in the usual -course of his business, because he is also a manufacturer of the article dealt in.
Exceptional and rare cases, not arising out of the sale of patented things in the ordinary way, may be imagined where this
general classification separating the merchants and dealers from
the rest of the people might be regarded as not sufficiently
comprehensive, because in such unforeseen, unusual and exceptional cases the people affected โข by the .statute ought, in
strictness, to have been included in the exception. See opinion
of Circuit Court herein, 127 Fed. Rep., suprd. But we do not
think the statute should be condemned on that account. It is
because such imaginary and unforeseen cases are so rare and
exceptional as to have been overlooked that the general classification ought not to be rendered invalid. In such case there is
really no substantial denial of the equal protection of the laws
within the meaning of the amendment.
It is almost impossible, in some matters, to foresee and provide for every imaginable and exceptional case, and a legislature ought not to be required to do so at the risk of having
its legislation declared void, although appropriate and proper.
upon the general subject upon which such legislation is to act,
so long as there is no substantial and fair ground to say that the
statute makes an unreasonable and unfounded general classification, and thereby denies to any person the equal protection
of the laws. In a classification for governmental purposes there.
cannot be an exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and things.
See Gulf &c. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, and cases cited; Missouri &c. Co. v. May, 194 U. S. 267. We can see reasons for
excepting merchants and dealers who sell patented things, in
the usual course of business, from the provisions of the statute,

OZAN LUMBER CO. v. UNION COUNTYBANK. 257
Opinion of the Court.

207 U. S.

and we think the failure to exempt some few others, as above
suggested, ought not to render the whole statute void as resulting in an unjust and unreasonable discriminatioin.
The case of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540,
one of the cases cited by the Circuit Court, is not in our opinion
applicable. The statute did not apply to 'agricultural products
or livestock while in the hands of the producer or raiser. It was
held that this exemption rendered the statute void, as denying
to persons within the jurisdiction of the State the equal protation of the laws. The statute was held to create a classification of an arbitrary nature, applicable to large numbers of
people, and yet not based upon any reasonable ground. - Those
who were exempted from its provisions were numerous and
stood practically in the same relation to the subject matter of
the statute as did the other class upon whom. the statute acted,
and no valid reason could be given why, if one were included,
the other should be exempted. The same reasons applied to all
the classes, and should have led to the same results with regard
to all. There was no room for a proper or fair discrimination.
We think there is a distinction, founded upon fair reasoning,
which upholds the principle of exemption as contained in the
fourth section, and that, consequently, the statute does not
violate the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground stated.
The case was decided by the courts below solely upon constitutional grounds, and upon those grounds the decision cannot
rest. It must, therefore, be remanded, and if there be any other
facts to be urged they can be presented on another trial.
The judgments of the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of
Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
Peversed.
