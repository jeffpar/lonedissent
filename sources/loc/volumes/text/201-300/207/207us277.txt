PATCH v. WABASH RAILROAD COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 57.

ArIgued November 15, 1907.-Decided December 2, 1907.

The certificate of a judge of the Circuit Court that the judgment is based
solely on jurisdictional grounds is an act of record and qusre whether it
stands on any different ground from judgments and the like when the term
has passed, and whether it can then be amended so as to show that it was
signed inadvertently and by mistake and to certify that the question of
jurisdiction was not passed on and that the decision was based on another
ground, Such a mistake is not clerical.
The provision in a state statute that no non-resident shall be appointed or
act as administrator or executor does not open the appointment of a nonresident to collateral attack in an action brought by him so as to deprive
him of his right to file a plea that the case cannot be removed to the Federal court.
A corporation incorporated simultaneously and freely in several States
exists in each State by virtue of the laws of that State and when it lncurs a liability under the laws of one of the States in which it is incorporated and is sued therein it cannot escape the jurisdiction thereof and
remove to the Federal court on the ground that as it is also incorporated
in the other States it is not a citizen of that State. Southern Railway
v. A!/ison, 190 U. S. 326 and other cases, holding that where the corporation originally incorporated in one State was compelled to become a corporation of another State so as to exercise its powers therein, distinjuished.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Frederic D. McKenney, with whom Mr. Wells H. Blodgett was on the brief, for defendant in error:
For the purposes of jurisdiction Qf the courts of the United
States, domicile is the test of citizenship; and in a jurisdictiQnal sense the words " citizen" and "domicile" are
synonymous. Poppenhauser v. Comb Co., 14 Fed. Rep. 707;

Ashland, 112 Fed. Rep. 175; Morris v. Gilmer, 129 U. S. 315;
Anderson v. Watts, 138 U. S. 694; Sun Printing and Publishing
Company v. Edwards, 194 U. S.377.
The word "resident" as used in the last proviso to ยง 18,
chap. 3, of the Administration Statutes of Illinois as amended
by the act of 1905 (Laws of Illinois, 1905, p. 2) is synonymous
with domicile. In re Mulford, 217 Illinois, 242; McDaniel v.
King, 5 Cush. 469; Strongton v. Cambridge, 165 Massachusetts,

Grizard, 89 N. Car. 115; Ryall v. Kennedy, 67 N. Y. 379.
The allegation of plaintiff in error in his plea in abatement to
the defendant's removal petition, that "before and at the time
of the commencement of this action this plaintiff was and still
is a citizen of Ohio," is equivalent, in legal effect to an allegation that the domicile of plaintiff was at the time in the State
of Ohio, and hence that he was at the time a non-resident of
Illinois.
No question of collateral, attack on the judgment of the
Probate Court of Cook county, Illinois, appointing plaintiff
in error administrator de bonis non of Maxon's estate, properly
aiises on this record. The sole question is whether plaintiff in

error, by his allegation of his citizenship in Ohio, affirmatively
showed on the face of the record, his want of legal capacity to
institute this suit or file any plea herein, under the prohibitions
of ยง 18, chap. 3, of the Administration Statutes of Illinois, as
amended by the act of 1905, which provides that no nonresident of this State shall be appointed or act as administrator
or executor.
Plaintiff's plea in abatement to defendant's removal petition
is insufficient.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This was an action brought by the plaintiff in error to recover
for the death of his intestate in a collision upon the defendant's
railroad in Illinois. The action was begun in a court of the
State and the defendants forthwith filed a petition for the removal of the cause to the United States Circuit Court. The
petition averred, among other things, that the defendant was
a corporation organized under the laws of Ohio. and a citizen
of that State, and was not a resident of Illinois, and that the
plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Illinois. The removal
was ordered and completed. Thereupon the plaintiff filed in
the United States Court a plea, in which he alleged that the
defendant was a corporation organized and existing under and
by virtue of the laws of Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan
and Ohio, by the consolidation of five other corporations,
severally creatcd by the laws of those States respectively, that
the defendant was a citizen of and resident in Illinois and each
of said other States, and that the plaintiff was a citizen of Ohio;
and the plaintiff prayed judgment whether the court could
take cognizance of the action.
The defendant, after having pleaded the general issue to
the action, demurred to the plaintiff's plea. Upon a hearing
the demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff, electing to stand
by his plea, a judgment was entered that the defendant recover
its costs. The plaintiff prayed a writ of error, and the Judge

PATCH v. WABASH RAILROAD COMPANY.
207 V. S.

281

Opinion of the Court.

certified that the judgment was based solely on the ground
that the controversy was one between citizens of different
States, that in his opinion the record showed that the defendant was not a citizen of or resident in Illinois, that no other
ground of jurisdiction appeared, and that jurisdiction was
retained only for the reasons stated. A few days later, but
after the writ of error had been taken out and filed, and after
a new term of the Circuit Court had begun, the Judge undertook to amend the certificate on the ground that it had been
signed inadvertently under a mistake as to its nature and contents, and to certify instead that the question of jurisdiction
was not passed upon, but that the ground of the decision was
that the 'plaintiff, being a citizen of Ohio, and therefore presumed not to be a resident of Illinois, was forbidden by the
statutes of Illinois to act as administrator, and therefore had
no standing to maintain the action or file the plea.
It is obvious that the mistake alleged by the new certificate
was not clerical. The Judge did not write one thing when he
meant to write another, and no inferior officer made a record
not corresponding to the action of the court. We cannot read
the words "Under a mistake as to the nature and contents
thereof," as meaning that the Judge did not know that he was
signing a certificate for this court, or as signifying more than
that, if he had given the matter greater attention he would not
have signed one saying what it said. The certificate must have
received some consideration, as it contains a statement or
ruling adverse to the plaintiff, to which we shall refer in a
moment. This being so, it appears to us extremely questionable,
at least, whether such a 'certificate, which is an act of record,
stands on any different ground from judgments and the like
when the term has passed; see Wetmore v. Karrick, 205 U. S.
141, 153, et seq..; Michigan Insurance Bank v. Eldred, 143 U. S
293, and also whether the so-called amendment, supposing it
otherwise valid and properly made without leave of this court,
can be considered by this court on the present writ of error.

Co., 21 How. 82.
If we were to consider the amendment it would amount to
this: The plaintiff pleaded to the jurisdiction of. the court as a
court of the United States and stood upon his plea. The Judge,
however, laid down a proposition of law on which he denied
the right of the plaintiff to plead to the jurisdiction, and thereupon took jurisdiction so far as to give judgment for costs.
By the analogies of the action of this court in other cases, we
should decide for ourselves the preliminary as well as the final
question of law in order to decide whether the Circuit Court,
as a court of the United States, had the right to give any judgment, even for costs. If the peliminary question should be
considered it would seem that the Judge below was wrong in
taking the proviso in the Illinois statute (Laws of 1905, p. 2;
Hurd, Rev. Stats. 1905, c. 3, ยง 18,"pp. 107, 108), "that no nonresident of this State shall be appointed or- act as administra.
tor or executor,." as opening the appointment of a citizen of
Ohio to this kind of collateral attack. See Simmons v. Saul,
138 U. S.439; Salomon v. People, 191 Illinois, 290,.294. It is
not reasonable to interpret it as making such a severance between the appointment and the power to Act which is a consequence of the appointment as to leave the former unimpeachable in these proceedings but its effect open to dispute.. The
words "or act" may have reference more especially to executors,
and may be a reminiscence of the ancient law, by which they
derived their powers from the will,'a notion that has died hard.
At all events presumably they offer an alternative to "shall
be appointed," and refer to action without appointment in
Illinois, for instance action by an administrator appointed
elsewhere, not to action after appointment when one is. made.
As we read them with our present light, at least, we deem them
insufficient to prevent the plaintiff from insisting upon his
right to keep out of the United States court.
We proceed then to deal with the merits of the plea. The
original certificate declares that the record shows that the de-

fendant is not a citizen of or resident in the State of Illinois.
If this be correct, it maintains the right to remove, so far as
it goes. The right is given in cases of this sort to defendants
"being non-residents of that State," that is, of the State in
which the suit is brought. Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25
Stat. 433, 434. If the defendant is to be regarded as a citizen
of'Illinois, the right to remove did not exist. Martin v. Snyder,
148 U. S. 663. It was for this reason, no doubt, that the, petition for removal alleged that the defendant was a citizen of
Ohio, and that the certificate declared that it was not a citizen
of Illinois. ' But the plea averred that it was organized and
existed under the laws. of that State as well as of the others
named. , It is true, however, that it did not and could not
traverse the averment of the petition, considered as an averment of fact, and it was demurred to specially on that ground.
Therefore the question israised hovf a corporation or corporations thus organized shall be regarded for the purposes of
a suit like this. No nice speculation as to whether the corporation is one or many, and no details as to the particulars of the
consolidation, are needed for an answer: The defendant exists
in Illinois by virtue of -the laws of Illinois. It is alleged to have
incurred a liability under the laws of the same State, and is
sued in that State. It cannot escape the jurisdiction by the
.fact that it is incorporated elsewhere. The assent of the State
to such' incorporation elsewhere, supposing it to have been
given, a matter upon which we express no opinion, cannot be
presumed to lkave intended or to import such a change. This
seems to be the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois, as
it certainly has been shown to be that of this court. -Chicago&

What would be the law in case of a,suit brought in Illinois upon

left on one side, as also may be the decisions in cases where a

corporation originally created in one State afterwards becomes
compulsorily a corporation of another State for some purposes
in order to extend its powers. Southern Ry. Co. v. Alison,
190 U. S. 326; St. Louis & San FranciscoRy. Co. v. James, 161
U. S. 545. In the case at bar the incorporations must be taken
to have been substantially simultaneous and free. See Memphis & Charleston R. R. Co. v. Alabama, 107 U. S. 581. If any
distinction were to be made it hardly could be adverse to the
jurisdiction of Illinois, in view of the requirements of its constitution and statutes that a majority of the directors should
be residents of Illinois, and that the corporation should keep a
general office in that State. We are of opinion that the defendant must be regarded in this suit as a citizen of Illinois, and
therefore as having had no right to remove. It follows that
the cause should be remanded to the state court.
