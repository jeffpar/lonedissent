THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.'
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF THE

UNITED STATES FOR

THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE AND THE WESTERN
DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.
Nos. 216, 222. Argued April 10, 11, 12, 1907.-Decided January 6,1908.
In testing the constitutionality of an act of Congress this court confines
itself to the power of Congress to pass the act and may not consider any
real or imaginary evils arising from its execution.
Under the grant given by the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce and the authority given to use all means appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred, Congress has power to regulate the relation
of master and servant to the extent that such regulations are confined
solely to interstate commerce.
An act addressed to all common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, and
imposing a liability upon them in favor of any of their employ&s, without
qualification or restriction as to the nature of the business at the time
of the injury, of necessity includes subjects wholly outside of the power
of Congress under the commerce clause of the Constitution.
The legislative power of Congress over the District of Columbia and .the
Territories is plenary and does not depend upon the special grants of
power, such as the commerce clause of the Constitution.
To restrict a general act of Congress relating to common carriers, by interpretation to interstate commerce so as to validate it as to the carriers in
the several States, would unduly restrict it as to carriers in the District
of Columbia and the Territories.
While it is the duty of this court fo soconstrue an act of Congress as to
render it constitutional if it can be lawfully done, an ambiguous statute
cannot be rewritten to accomplish this result.
Where a statute contains some provisions that are constitutional and some
that are not, effect may be given to the former by separating them
from the latter, but this rule does not apply where the provisions of the
statute are dependent upon each other And are indivisible, or where it
does not plainly appear that Congress would have enacted the constitutional legislation without the unconstitutional provisions.
One engaging in interstate commerce does not thereby submit all his business to the regulating power of Congress.

207 U. S.

While the act of Congress of June 11, 1906, 34 Stat. 232, known as the Employers' "Liability Act, embraces subjects within the authority of Congress to regulate commerce, it also includes subjects not within its constitutional power, and the two are so interblended in the statute that
they are incapable of separation and the statute is therefore repugnant
1
to the Constitution of the United States-and non-enforcible.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the act of
Congress of July 11, 1906, relating to the liability of common

carriers in the District of Columbia and Territories and common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to their employds, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William R. Harrfor plaintiff in error in No. 216.
Mr. J. E. Torrance, with whom Mr. S. C. Bloss, Mr. Geo.
See p. 489.
MR. JusTIcE DAY concurred with M. JUSTICE WHITE. See p. 504.
MR. JUSTICE PEcKHAm delivered a separate opinion, with which the
CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JusTIcE BREWzR agreed, concurring in result and
in the proposition that as to traffic or other matters within the State the
act is uneonstitutional and it cannot be separated from that part which
is claimed to be valid as relating to interstate commerce, but stating that
he was not able to agree with all that is stated in the opinion of the court
as to the power to legislate upon the subject of the relations between
master and servant. See p. 504.
MR. JUSTICE MOODY delivered a separate opinion, agreeing with the
opinion of the court in respect to the power of Congress to regulate the
relation between common carriers engaged in interstate commerce and
their employds, but dissenting from the result and conclusion that the act
embraces subjects not within the constitutional power of Congress to regulate. See p. 504.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JusTIcE McKENNA concurred,
delivered a separate opinion, agreeing with that part of the opinion of the
court which held that it was within the power of Congress to prescribe, as
between an interstate carrier and its employss, the rule of liability established by the act, but dissenting as to the result and asto the interpretation
given to the act in the opinion of the court and concurring in the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE MOODY as to thp scope and interpretation of the
act. See p. 540.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered a separate dissenting opinion expressing
the view that the words of the act could be read in such a way as to save
its constitutionality by limiting its scope where necessary and that as so
construed the act is valid in its main features under the Constitution.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Durelle and Mr. W. M. Smith were on the brief, for plaintiff
in error in 14o. 222:
The act of June 11, 1906, is a regulation of interstate commerce. The Constitution is one of enumeration and not of
definition; the power of Congress over interstate commerce is
as extensive as that of the legislative body of any sovereign
state over its commerce. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 187.
The power of Congress to regulate commerce extends to all
the means, appliances, facilities and instrumentalities of commerce. Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275, 280; Northern Se.curitiesCompany v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 344; Stockton
v. Baltimore & N. Y. R. Co., 32 Fed. Rep. 9, 16. And this
power extends to persons as well as property. Linn Sing v.
Washburn, 20 California, 543; "Head Money Cases," 18 Fed.
Rep. 135; Memphis & Little Rock Ry. Co. v. Nolan &c., 14 Fed.
Rep. 532. *This power also extends to those internal concerns
which affect the States generally. See Gibbons v. Ogden, supra,
195.
A statute limiting a vessel owner's liability is valid. The
Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 577; Providence &c. S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg.
Co., 109 U. S. 589. See opinion of Harlan, J., sustaining an
employers' liability act of the State of Ohio. Peirce v. Van
Dusen, 78 Fed. Rep. 700.
State acts of this character have been held constitutional,
as within the police powers of the State. Missouri Pacific
R. R. Co. v. Mackey, 33 Kansas, 298; S. C., 127 U. S. 205; Chicago &c. R. R. Co. v. Zernecker, 59 Nebraska, 689.
But the State may enact certain legislation for a purpose
that is lawful, as police or quarantine legislation, while Congress
may enact the same measures for the purpose of regulating
commerce or as war regulation. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra. See
Chicago &c. Ry. Co. v. Solan, 169 U. S. 133, 137, upholding a
state statute denying to common carriers a right to limit their
common law liability. Freund on Police Powers, 1904, p. 66,
and also Houston & T. C. R. R. Co. v. Mayes, 201 U. S. 321.
Congress has the power to go beyond the general regulations

of commerce which it is accustomed to establish, and to descend to the most minute directions, if it shall be deemed advisable; and as to whatever ground shall be covered by those
directions, the exercise of the state power is excluded. Congress may establish police regulations, as well as the States;
confining their operations to the subject over which it is given
control by the Constitution. Cooley's Const. Lim. (7th ed.),
856 and see Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U. S. 196,
215; Championv. Ames (Lottery Cases), 188 U. S. 321. For the
purpose of regulating commerce Congress can exercise the power
of eminent domain. Luxton v. Bridge Company, 153 U. S. 525.
Congress by the act of June 11, 1906, has placed an additional
burden on' interstate common carriers and thus on interstate
commerce and this brings the act clearly within the commerce
clause of the Constitution. Hall v. De Cuir, 95 U. S. 485,
488. See message of President Roosevelt, December 5, 1906.
The Employers' Liability Act is a regulation of interstate
commerce. It places the cost of certain classes of injuries to
employds uniformly upon the interstate common carrier.
If each State is allowed to say for itself whether or not the
cost is to be borne by the interstate conumon carrier or by the
family of the servant, it is apparent that common carriers
passing through certain States with no liability acts will have
an unnatural advantage over those not so situated. This uniformity is desirable. Railroad Company v. Baugh, 149 U. S.
368.
There should be no unnatural elements such as might be
created by particular state laws-or constructions by state courts
placed upon the fellow-servant rule to vary the element of
liability for injuries to employds in the general problem of the
costs of interstate commerce.
The Federal liability act will secure better and safer service.
The fellow-servant doctrine was based in part on a view that
the best service was obtained by placing the, cost of certain
negligence oin the servaut. Priestly v. Fowler) 3 M. & W. 1;
Murray v. South Carolina R. R. Co., I McMull L. (S. Car.)

Am. Dec. 339; Sullivan v. Mississippi &c. R. Co., 11 Iowa,
421; Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Erickson, 41 Nebraska, 1.
Congress now takes the view that better service will be secured
by the ruse of liability established by the act of June 11, which
is similar in its scope to the Safety Appliaice Act. 27 Stat. L.
531; Chicago &c. R. R. Co. V. Ross, 112 U. S. 377. That is constitutional. Kansas City &c. R. R. Co. v. Flipps,138 Alabama,
487. It has been construed in Johnson v. Southern Pac. Co.,
117 Fed. Rep. 462; affirmed 196 U.S. 1, and in Chicago &c. R. R.
Co. V. Voelker, 129 Fed. Rep. 526; S. C., 116 Fed. Rep. 867.
The form of the rule -or statute regulating interstate commerce is within the discretion of Congress. To effect this end
of uniformity Congress may use such means as it may deem
appropriate. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4'Wheat. 316, 421, 423.
An act of Congress to be within its power to regulate commerce need not upon its face, expressly prescribe a rule for
carrying on commercial intercourse among the States. The
rule may be prescribed by implication. A law which may
reasonably be calculated to further the freedom, uniformity
and safety of commerce, or its instrumentalities, prescribes
a rule for carrying on commerce within the scope of the power
to regulate commerce among the States.
The act shows by its title and in its body that it applies to
interstate commerce, and it is not framed so that its provisions are applicable alike to all commerce.
'The court will not broaden the statute by construction to
include an employ6 of an interstate common carrier, who is
concerned wholly in that part of the carrier's business which
is intrastate, for the purpose of then holding the entire act
Awconstitutional. It will rather hold in a proper case that such
an employ6 is not within the view of the act. Kansas v. Smiley,
65 Kansas, 240; S. C., 196 U. S. 447.
State statutes relating to commerce which are in terms so
general that interstate as well as intrastate commerce may be
included are construed to include only what the legislature

207 U. S.

might lawfully include in them. 17 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law
(2d ed.), 76; Louisville &c. Ry. Jo. v. Mississippi, 133 U. S.
587.
An act will be so construed f possible, as to avoid conflict
with the Constitution althougl, such a construction may not
be the most obvious or natural one. The courts may resort
to an implication to sustain a statute, but not to destroy it.
Atlantic City Water Works Co. v. Consumers' Water Co., 44
N. J. Eq. 427; 1 Sutherland, Stat. Const. (2d ed.), § 298, p. 584;
Opinion of the Justices, 41 N. H. 555.
A statute will not be held unconstitutional merely because
there may be persons to whom or cases in which, it cannot
constitutionally apply; but it is deemed constitutional and
to be construed not to apply to the latter persons or cases,
on the grounds that courts are bound to presume that the
legislature did not intend to violate the Constitution. And see
The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S.82. The attempt to justify
the act under the commerce clause was an afterthought;
but in this case the phiaseology of the act plainly indicates
under what clause of the Constitution Congress assumed to act.
Illinois Central R. Co. v. McKendree can also be distinguished.
The construction of the Liability Act now contended for
here has been given the Safety Appliance Act in Johnson v.
Southern Pac. Co., 196 U. S. 1. The wor'ding of this act is
open to all the objections that counsel urge against the act
under consideration. If the car or engine in a particular case
is not engaged as an instrumentality of interstate commerce,
then the Safety Appliance Act will not be enforced
But in the cases at bar, all the employs and trains concorned were engaged in interstate commerce, and the right
of the plaintiff to recover is clearly within the terms of the act.
The "fellow-servant" rule as followed by the Federal courts
is a rule of judicial decision and construction. The act of
June 11, 1906, changes this rule of determining liability. The
power to determine such rules as the Federal courts shall
f IoN," has always been exercised by Congress.

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.
207 U. S.

Argument of Attorney General.

The Attorney General as amicus curice by leave of the court
upon the constitutionality of the Employers' Liability Act,
with whom Mr. William R. Harr, Special Assistant to the
Attorney General, was on the brief:
The act was a natural and logical step from the Safety Ap)liance Act, which required interstate railroads to equip their
cars with certain described appliances and abolished the doctrine
of assumption of risk on the part of cmploy6s in the case of
their failure to do so. The acts of March 3,' 1901, 31 Stat.
1446; of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 838; of March 4,1907. 34 Stat.
1415, all relating to the relation of employers and employ6s engaged in interstate commerce are all part of a general scheme
by Congress to lessen the dangers of railroad transportation
to those engaged in or connected therewith. If this statute
is unconstitutional, it is difficult to see how, on principle, the
other measures referred to can be su:tained. See also the
President's annual messages of December 6. 1904, 39 Cong.
Rec. 11; of December 5, 1905, 40 Cong. Rec. 93; Johnson v.
Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S. 1.
-As to the question of public policy involved in maintaining
the fellow-servant rule see McKinney on Fellow Servants, § 10;
Priestley v. Fowler, 1837, 3 M. & W. 1; Hutchinson v. York
&c. Ry. Co., 1850, 5 Exch. 341; McMurray v. So. Car. R. ti.
Co., 1838, 1 McMullan, *385; Ryan v. Cumberland Valley R. R.
Co., 1854, 23 Pa. St. 384; Farwell v. Boston &c. R. R. Co., 1842,
4 -Mete. 49, 57. But see also Schlemmer v. Buffalo R. & P.
Ry. Co., 205 U. S. 1; 2 Labbatt on Master & Servant, chaps.
36-40, and the acts of Parliament of 1881, 1.897 and 1902;
Cooley on Torts, 542, 545.
The Parliament of England and many of the state legislatures of this country, however, have not acquiesced in the
views as to the requirements of public policy entertained by
the courts that have created and extended the fellow-servant
doctrine, so far, at least, as the more hazardous employments,
and particularly railroading, a,'e concerned. It also appears
that other European countries, including France, Germany

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.
Argument of Attorney General.

207 U. S.

and Austria, are in accord with the more enlightened views on
this subject.
Many States have legislated on the subject, modifying the
common law rule. See the acts of Georgia of 1855; of Iowa
in 1862; of Kansas in 1874.
The English Employers' Liability Act of 1880-1881 has been
followed, more or less closely, by Alabama in 1884; Massachusetts in 1887; Colorado in 1893; Indiana in 1893; New
York in 1902. The statutes of these States do not limit the
amount of recovery.
The following States have also materially modified or abolished the fellow-servant doctrine: Ohio in 1890; Mississippi in
1890; Texas in 1891; Arkansas in 1893; South Carolina in
1895; North Carolina in 1897; Utah in 1875; Wisconsin in
1889.
And see sustaining this legislation: Chicago &c. R. R. Co.
v. Ross, 112 U. S. 377, 382; Shearman & Redfield on Negligence (5th ed.),'§ 178.. See also Lovll v. Howell, L. R. 1 C. P.
D. 161, 167; Ziegler v. Danbury &c. R. R. Co., 52 Connecticut,
543, 556; Crispin v. Babbitt, 81 N. Y. 516, 528.
As the enforcement or abrogation of the rule is a matter
of public policy, and necessarily a matter for the, consideration and control of the legislature under our governmental
systems, to whom matters of public policy are primarily committed, Congress is the proper authority to determine what
public policy requires with reference to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce.
State legislation modifying or abolishing the common law
doctrine of common employment and assumption of risk has
been uniformly sustained by the state and Federal courts, as
a proper exercise of the police power. Mo. Pac. Ry. .'o.v.
Mackey, 127 U. 'S. 205, 208; Minneapolis Ry. Co. v. Herrick,
127 U. S. 210; Chicago &c. R. R. v. Pontius, 157 U. S. 209;

157 Indiana, 494; and Tullis v. Lake Erie & Western, 175

be constitutional. Railroad Co. v. Thompson, 54 Georgia,
509; Georgia Railroad v. Ivey, 73 Georgia, 499; Georgia Railroad v. Brown, 86 Georgia, 320; Georgia Railroad v. Miller,
90 Georgia, 574. As to labor statute of Missouri, see St. Louis
&c. Railway v. Matthews, 165 U. S. 1, 25; of Utah, Holden v.
Hardy, 169 U. S. 366, 391, 397;. of Arkansas, St. Louis & Iron
Mountain R. R. Co. v. Paul, 173 U. S. 404. See also Atchison
&c. Railroad v. Matthews, 174 U. S. 96.
The liability of common carriers for injuries to their employds is a proper subject of governmental regulation, and a
State in the exercise of its police powers may make such reasonable regulations on the subject with respect to all carriers
operating within its limits as the legislature thereof may
deem necessary. Being a. proper subject of governmental
regulation, Congress, in the exercise of its constitutional power
to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, may regulate the
liability of such common carriers as are engaged in that commerce.
See the definition of the power of Congress over interstate
and foreign commerce given in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1
(p. 197). From the foundation of the Government the power
of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce has
been construed to extend to the regulation of the instrumentalities by which such commerce is conducted, and the
regulation of such instrumentalities to include control over
the person operating the same. Concurring opinion in Gibbons

587; Stockton v. Baltimore &c. Railroad, 32 Fed. Rep. 9. In
California v. Pacific Railroad, 127 U. S. 1, 39, the power of
Congress to provide for interstate roads was sustained; as
to the Panama Canal see Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U. S. 24; for a
review of legislation in regard to interstate commerce and
regulations see In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 578; The Lottery
Case, 188 U. S. 321, 352; United States v. Joint Traffic Assn.,
171 U. S. 505, 569.
As to the claim that if this commerce is subject to regulation at all it can only be by the States, the answer is that the
regulation of interstate commerce has been committed by the
Constitution to Congress; and while state legislation, passed
in the exercise of its police power, may control the liability
of common carriers within their limits, even though they be
engaged in interstate commerce, yet such legislation must
yield to the plenary and paramount authority of Congress over
interstate commerce whenever it chooses to exercise it. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210; Cooley v. Board of Wardens,
12 How. 299, 320; Morgan v. Louisiana, 118 U. S. 455, 463;
Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465; Nashville, Chattanooga &
St. Louis Ry. v. Alabama,. 128 U. S. 96, 100; Western Union
Telegraph Co. v. James, 162 U. S. 650, 662; Hennington v.
Georgia, 163 U. S. 299, 317; New York, New Haven & HartTord Railroad v. New York, 165 U. S. 628, 631; Missouri,
Kansas & Texas Railway v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613, 626; Rasmussen v. Idaho, 181 U. S. 198, 200; Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S.
137.
The power of Congress to regulate the liability of common
carriers and others engaged in interstate commerce for injuries
to persons or property having been distinctly recognized, it is
difficult to see why it may not regulate their liability to their

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.

Argument of Attorney General.

employ~s, the protection of interstate commerce being as much
involved in the one case as in the other. Mo. Pac. Railway
v. Mackey, supra; Pierce v. Van Dusen, 78 Fed. Rep. 693,
698.
The liability of common carriers engaged in interstate coinmerce for injuries to their employ6s occasioned by their negligence is a matter that vitally enters into and affects such
commerce. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad v. Baugh, 149 U. S.
368.
No one can successfully question the correctness of the court's
statement that the liability of a common carrier engaged in
interstate commerce for injuries to its employds is a question
in which the whole country is interested, and should be governed by a uniform rule. But simply holding that the question is one of general law, which a Federal court may determine for itself in the absence of a state statute on the subject,
does not tend to secure the desired uniformity, but only causes
greater complexity of decision. Besides, most of the States
have legislated on the subject and their statutes are conflicting.
Uniformity of decision, it is manifest, can only be secured by
National legislation.
As to power of Congress to provide this uniformity see
Pennsylvania Railroad v. Hughes, 191 U. S. 477; Martin v.
Pittsburg &c. Railroad, 203 U. S. 284 and cases cited supra.
The acts of Congress limiting liability of shipowners,
§§ 4283, 4289, Rev. Stat., rest on the power of Congress to
regulate interstate and foreign commerce. Lord v. Steamship
Co., 102 U. S. 541; The Katie, 40 Fed. Rep. 480; In re Garnett,
141 U. S. 1; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 576; Butler v.
Steamship Co., 130 U. S. 527. The Limited Liability Act was
passed by Congress for the purpose of fostering and encouraging
the American merchant marine and the American foreign carrying trade. Such also was undoubtedly the purpose of the
Harter Act, approved February 13, 1893, 27 Stat. 445, which
has been liberally construed and applied by this court in a
number of cases. Calderon v. Atlas Steamship Co., 170 U. S

It is for Congress to determine what public policy requires
with respect to common carriers engaged in interstate corn-.

considerations justifies the interference of the judiciary or is
an argument against the existence of the power. United States
v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 569, 571, 573; Gibbons V.
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; The Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 363; McCray v.
United States, 195 U. S. 27, 55.
The power of Congress to regulate instrumentalities of interstate commerce is not dependent upon their mode 0i creation.
It is not limited to corporations created by Congress itself.
While a corporation may get from a State its franchise to
engage in interstate commerce, it can only exercise that franchise subject to the regulations which Congress may make
for the protection of interstate commerce.- Hale v. Henkel,
201 U. S. 43, 75; Northern Securities.Case, 193 U.. S. 197; New
York & New Haven Railroad v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. 5. 361.
The situation is similar to that with respect to the power of
Congress to regulate bridges across the navigable waters constructed under the authority of the States. The franchise
granted by the State is held subject to the paramount authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, 125 U. S. 1; West Chicago Street
RailroadCo. v. Chicago, 201 U. S. 506, 524; Union Bridge Co. v.
United States, 204 U. S. 364.
Congress by this act has established a rule oL conduct and
the statute imposes exactly the same rule of conduct upon
carriers with respect to employds as 'is to be imposed by the
common law with respect to passengers and strangers.
Congress has the same power to alter the common law rule
as to non-survivorship in cases affecting interstate commerce of

actions ex delicto as a State has to change the rule of nonsurvivorship of such actions.
In this respect the act of Congress creates no innovation,
as such statutes exist in most, if not all, of the States. And
see Sherlock v. Ailing, 93 U. S. 99, as to power of State.
So also Congress has power to. alter rule as to effect of contributory negligence. While there is no question of contributory
negligence in this pase it is proper to refer to it in connection
with the act.
The common law rule that contributory negligence bars
a recovery, like the fellow-servant doctrine, is founded upon
the supposed interests of public policy, and it is for Congress to
determine in regulating this subject whether" public policy requires the modification of both rules.
The rule which Congress has adopted in the present statute
is, theoretically at least, ideal. If it should operate harshly
or unjustly, the parties concerned must apply to Congress and
not to the courts for relief.
The statute simply provides that contributory negligence
on the part of an employ6 shall not bar a recovery where it
was slight and that of the employer gross in comparison; but it
also provides that the damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employ6.
The aim of Congress was to do exact justice. The wisdom of
such a rule as applied to marine torts was recognized in The
Max Morris, 187 U. S. 1.
The same doctrine was applied to The Mystic, 44 Fed. Rep.
399; The Frank & Willie, 45 Fed. Rep. 405, 497; The Nathan
Hale, 48 Fed. Rep. 700; The Julia Fowler, 49 Fed. Rep. 279;
The Serapis, 49 Fed. Rep. 396, 397; The J. & J. McCarthy,
55 Fed. Rep. 86; The Cyprus, 55 Fed. Rep. 333; Wm. Johnson
& Co. v. Johnson, 86 Fed. Rep. 888. All except the first were
cases in which an injured employ6, himself at fault, was allowed to recover divided or partial damages for injuries received through the negligence of his employer.
For modifications of the strict rule of contributory negligence

Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio. See also H. R. Rep.. No. 2335,
59th Cong., 1st Sess.
As to the construction of the act, it is limited to subjects
within the control of Congress and does not affect any matters
not within such control.
Whether a particular carrier is engaged in interstate or
foreign commerce within the meaning of the act is a question
to be determined as the occasion arises.
As the States, in the exercise of their police powers, may
enact legislation of the kind here in question, although it may
ihcidentally affect interstate commerce, by a parity of reasoning, Congress, in the exercise of its authority to regulate interstate commerce, may enact such legislation, although it incidentally affects state commerce.
There is an essential difference between the power of Congress
over an article or commodity which ceases to be a subject of
interstate commerce the moment its interstate transportation
ceases, and the instrumentality by which such commodity may
be transported. Johnson v. Southern Pacific, 196 U. S. 1;
Voelker v. Chicago &c. Railway, 116 Fed. Rep. 867; S. C., 129
Fed. Rep. 522, 528; United States v. Great Northern Railway,
145 Fed. Rep. 438.
It is not contended that Congress can regulate the exclusively
local business in which a common carrier may be engaged.
If a railroad- company operating an interstate road were also
operating a purely local line, this act Would not apply to
such line, because, in respect thereto, the railroad company
would not be a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce.
The ac*t would no more apply to a purely local line of the company than to any other business-the mining of coal, for instance-in which it might be engaged. The Trade-Mark Cases,
100 1T. S. 82, can be. distinguished as the present statute discloses on its face that it is intended as a regulation of interstate
and foreign commerce, being expressly confined to common
carriers engaged in such commerce. The "main. purpose"

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.
207 U. S.

Argument of Attorney General.

of the act is not "to establish a regulation applicable to all
trade, to commerce at all points," but simply to regulate an
instrumentality of interstate commerce. It is not "designed
to govern commerce wholly between citizens of the same
State," but simply to protect interstate commerce. Local
commerce, if affected at all, is affected only indirectly and
incidentally. It has never been held that Congress was divested of control over the instrumentalities of interstate commnerce simply because local commerce might incidentally be
affected by its regulations. Interstate Commerce Commission v.
Baird, 194 U. S. 25; The "Beef Trust Case," Swift v. United
States, 196 U. S. 375; New York & New Haven v. Int. Com.
Comm., 200 U. S. 361.
On its face this statute relates only to interstate commerce. It seeks only to regulate the liability of a common
carrier engaged in such commerce to its employds-that is;
the persons employed by it for the purpose of carrying on its
business, and the only business referred to is trade and commerce between the several States. It is a remedial statute
and should, therefore, be liberally construed so as to accomplish the end in view. If to construe the statute to extend to
employ6s of such carrier not engaged in or connected with
the interstate business of the carrier would render the statute
unconstitutional, such construction manifestly ought to be
rejected. The elementary rule that a statute should not be construed so as to render it unconstitutional when a constitutional
construction is open to the court hardly needs to be argued.
United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214; United States v. Harris,
106 U. S. 629; Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U. S. 678; James v.
Bowman, 190 U. S. 127; The Trade-Mark Cases, distinguished.
The statutes there involved were, on their face, plain attempts
to regulate matters beyond the control of Congress, and so
also in Illinois Central Railroad v. McKendree, 203 U. S. 514.

Nor does the fact that the act extends to all employ~s of
common carriers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, irrespective of the danger of their particular employments, vitiate it. The business of common carriers forms a
proper basis of classification and special legislation. It is not
necessary for the legislature to go further and differentiate
between the different classes of employ6s of such carriers according to the degree of danger to which they may be subjected, although possibly it may do so. As is well known,
there is every variety of risk in-the conduct of such carriers
and the power of the legislature to distinguish, select and
classify objects of legislation necessarily has a wide range of
discretion, and it is sufficient to satisfy the demands of the
Constitution if the classification is practical and not palpably
arbitrary. Tullis v. Lake Erie & Western Railroad, 175 U. S.
352, 353, referring to Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, 172 U. S.
557. The law is equitable, but were it otherwise, the injustice or harshness of the rule would be no just cause for declaring it invalid. In that case, as has been often held, the
remedy lies not with the courts, but with the legislature. If
necessary, under Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States,
143 U. S. 457; the general language of the statute might be
restricted to those employ6s of common carriers engaged in
interstate commerce whose business is of a hazardous nature,
as it was the dangers of transportation which were intended
to be remedied. And see Jones v. Guaranty and Indemnity
Co., 101 U. S. 626.
These matters relate to the application of the statute to
particular cases, and do not affect its constitutionality.
The act in question has recently been held to be constitutional by several Federal courts. Plummer v. Northern Pacific

Mr. J. M. Dickinson, with whom Mr. Charles N. Burch and
Mr. Blewett Lee wrp. on the brief, for defendants in error in
No. 216:
The Employers' Liability Act is not a regulation of commerce and is, therefore, .unconstitutional and void. The Government of the United States is one of enumerated powers,
and unless authority can be found in the National Constitution for the enactment of any particular legislation, then such
authority does not exist. The Constitution of the United
States specifies what powers Congress has and it has those
,powers therein specified and none other, except such as are
necessarily implied to carry into effect those which are granted.

Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; The Lottery Cases, 188 U. S.
321; Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S.270, 278.
This power of Congress must be exercised in a constitutional
way. It is not destructive of the rights and guaranties which
are to be found in other sections of the Constitution and the
amendments thereto. The power to regulate commerce cannot be so exercised as to deprive a citizen of property without
due process of law, but must be exercised in subordination to
the limitations and guaranties of the Constitution. Monongahela Nay. Co. v. United States,148 U. S.312.
The Employers"' Liability Act prescribes no rule for the
regulation of commerce, whether commerce be understood
to be either traffic or intercourse. It defines the liability of
an interstate carrier to his employ6s, creates new rights of
action in favor of such employds, and takes away from the
common' carrier defenses heretofore available. Such legisla7
tion is not a regulation of commerce, and Congress has no more

power to define the liability of common carriers, engaged in
interstate commerce, to their employ6s, than it has power to
legislate on the domestic relations of merchants engaged in
interstate commerce. The argument that this act is a constitutional regulation of interstate commerce proceeds upon
the fundamentally erroneous theory that Congress has power
to regulate persons engaged in interstate commerce in all the
relations of life,-whereas, the power conferred by the Constitution is only the regulation of the commerce itself.
No argument to sustain the constitutionality of the act in
question can draw any support from the Safety Appliance Acts
of March 2, 1893, April 1, 1896 and March 2, 1903.
Those acts definitely apply to instrumentalities of interstate commerce.
While undoubtedly Congress has power to enact laws to
carry into effect and to execute other laws, which it may
constitutionally enact; but the laws to be carried into effect
must be constitutionally enacted; the laws which carry into
execution the constitutional powers of the Government, must
be necessary and proper; that is they must be appropriate.

It is a general rule, that what cannot be done directly
from defect of power, cannot be done indirectly. Wayman

The court will determine for itself whether or not merely
giving a right of action against common carriers of interstate
commerce to their employ~s is of itself a regulation of commerce. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S.623; Minnesota v. Barber,
136 U. S.313; Hennington v. Georgia, 163 U. S. 299.
State statutes giving rights of action for torts against interstate carriers have been held not to be regulations of interstate
commerce. Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, 103. A Federal
statute, therefore, giving similar rights of action is not a
regulation of interstate commerce.
Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, does not hold that giving

a right of action for injury is a regulation of commerce, and
references in Peirce v. Van Dusen, 78 Fed. Rep. 693, and other
cases cited by plaintiff in error, as to the power of Congress to
legislate in regard to that subject, are obiter.
The act embraces both interstate and intrastate commerce,
proposes to exercise an . unconstitutional power over intrastate commerce, the police power of the States, the power of
the States to regulate the rights of their citizens inter sese in
matters not directly affecting interstate commerce, is inseparable as to its interstate commerce features, and, therefore, must fail in toto.
As to what interstate commerce is, see Sutherland on U. S.
Constr. 95; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; Addyston Pipe
Case, 175 U. S. 211, 241; License Cases, 5 How. 504, 574, 626,

Wall. 462, 470; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564. As to the
coexistence of both interstate and intrastate commerce see
Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232, 277; Hall v. DeCuir, 95 U. S.

United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1, 12, in which this
court said commerce succeeds to manufacture and is not a
part of it. And see Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578;
Diamond Glue Co. v. U. S. Glue Co., 187 U. S. 611; Northern
Securities Case, 193 U. S. 197, 350.
The act interferes with the police power of the State and
while there is an intrastate commerce which Congress cannot
regulate, there is also equally removed from the control of
the United States the police power of the States which affects
commerce and other relations in life, some related to commerce, and others entirely disassociated from it.
Although the limitations of the police power have never
been fully defined, the police power of the States falls directly within the effect of this act and will, if the act is conVOL. ccvii-31

stitutional, have limitations imposed upon it entirely inconsistent with the exercise of that power as hitherto recognized.
-The act seeks to control the relations between carriers of interstate commerce and their employ6s, not merely in matters
that affect, but do not burden, interstate commerce, but also
in matters which can have no direct bearing upon interstate
commerce.
This court has ever been equally careful to, preserve the
rights and powers of the States as well as those of the National
Government. Osborne v. Florida, 164 U. S. 650; Pullman Co.
v. Adams, 189 U. S.. 420; Pennsylvania Railroad v. Knight,
192 U. S. 21; Louisville &c. Railway Co. v. Mississippi, 133
U. S. 587, 591; C. & 0. Railway v. Kentucky, 179 U. S. 388, 393.
SQ the police power of the State has been sustained where
it_.operated upon articles of commerce after their interstate
character had ceased. The States of the Union have the undoubted right to control their purely internal affairs, in doing
which they exercise powers ncot surrendered to the National
Government. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100, 123; Mohile v.
Kimball, 102 U. S. 691; Escanaba Co. v. Chicago, 107 U. S.

Court of Plymouth County, 134 U. S. 31, 40; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. PaulRy. Co. v. Solan, 169 U. S. 133.
The statement in Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, that
Congress could legislate on the subject of ehgineers' examinations was 6aid only in respect of interstate commerce, and can
be no authority for the contention that because it was asserted
that Congress could in the particular matter legislate in respect
of interstate commerce, it could also regulate the carrier in
its strictly intrastate commerce activities, and in those matters
having no direct relation to commerce. Soalso Western Union

ference with interstate commerce. As to reasonable exercise
of state police power, see Gladson v. Minnesota, 166 U. S.

Lake Shore Railway v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285, 303; Lake Shore
Railway v. Smith, 173 U. S. 684, 689; Northern Securities Case,
193 U. S. 197, 382; B. & O. Railroad v. Baugh, 149 U. S.368,
distinguished.
The act is bad in that it proposes not merely'to give a right
of action for injuries to employ6s, but determines who the beneficiaries shall be. The beneficiaries are different from those
under the law of the State where the death occurred. Congress
has no power to regulate the measure of damages or who the
beneficiaries shall be. This is within the reserved power of the
States.
The cases cited in the brief of the United States as to the
rule of damages in the case of injuries on vessels fall under the
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction and not under the coinmerce clause. They have no application to the rules established by this statute. The statute, if constitutional as to any
part, is unconstitutional as to other parts and as it is inseparable it is entirely unconstitutional. United States v. Reese,
92 U. S.214, 221; Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S.82, 98; United
States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253; Illinois Central v. McKendree,
203 U. S.514; Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U. R. 678, 686; Ballard
v. Cotton Oil Co., 81 Mississippi, 507. The rule is the same
whether the case be civil or criminal. Conolly v. Union Sewer
Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 565. And on this point see also Allen v.
Louisiana, 103 U. S. 80; Sprague v. Thompson, 118 U. S. 90,
94; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S.601, 635,
from which it appears that an act of Congress covering legitimate as well as illegitimate fields of legislation in a single provision cannot be rendered effective by holding it invalid as
to the field wherein Congress had no power to legislate. To
reject the legislation so far as it is invalid and enforce the rernainder would amount to substituting legislation by the court
for that by Congress.

.Arbitrary and capricious classification, by which a class of

ute, it is obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment; if a Federal statute, it is obnoxious to the Fifth Amendment. Both
Amendments protect Corporations, as well as natural persons,
from being deprived of property without due process of law,
and, therefore, protect against arbitrary classification. County
of San Mateo V,, Southern PacificRailroad,13 Fed. Rep. 145, 150.
The act violates the Fifth Amendment because: It subjects common carriers, engaged in interstate commerce, to
different and greater liabilities than others engaged in interstate commerce; it takes away from'common carriers defer.scs
available to others engaged in interstate commerce; it limits
the powers of contract of common carrier's, Iwhen others engaged in interstate commerce are not so limited in their contracts with their employ6s; it subjects employ6s of such. common carriers to a disability in contracting which does not attach
to employds of others engaged in interstate commerce, who
render a like service under'similar conditions.
The right to contract is as well recognized as the right to
property and the courts protect it against unlawful restriction. Allgeyer-v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. '578; State v.. Julow,

common carriers, as by rail, by water, by telephone, by telegraph, by pipe line, by, wagon and otherwise.
There are not the same reasons for the abolition of the
fellow-servant rule as to clerks in the auditor's office as there
are for its abolition as applied to train operatives.
By due process of law is meant, that if a particular class
is to be given particular benefits or subjected to particular
burdens or disabilities, there should be some good reason for
such classification. Stratton v. Moris, 89 Tennessee, 497,
534.
There is no natural basis for the classification which has
been made, but the basis is purely arbitrary and capricious.
In order for a classification to be constitutional, it is not only
necessary that all persons brought under its influence are
treated alike under the same conditions, but it must bring
within its influence all who are under the same conditions,
and not bring within its influence those who are under different conditions. Mo. Pac. Railway v. Mackey, 127 U. S. 205;
Johnson v. St. Paul & Duluth R. R. Co., 8 L. R. A. 419; Ballard v. Oil Co., 81 MississiplBi, 507.
Some of the state courts have held employers' liability acts
constitutional, even though coughed in general language, and
applicable to all characters of business, whether hazardous
or not, this result being attained in most instances by construing such statutes, notwithstanding their general language,
to apply only to hazardous occupations; but such construction
is not countenanced by the Federal authorities. Lochner v.
.New York, 198 U. S. 45, 59.
This court, when not bound by a limiting state court construction, will investigate for itself the reasonableness of a
classification, made by a state legislature, and unless the
classification is natural and reasonable, will hold the act void.
It will undoubtedly exercise the same power when an act of
Congress is before it. Gulf, Colorado & Santa F6 R. R. Co. v.

The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The
act raises constitutional questions of the utmost gravity.
No one would question that a decision sustaining it must
necessarily extend the power of the Federal Government over
a field hitherto not contemplated as within its jurisdiction.
A decision holding the act unconstitutional, would not destroy
any generally prevailing' understanding as to the relations
between the several States and the United States; nor would
such a decision open up any wide field for serious conjecture
or apprchollsioti.
No one, however versed in the science of government and
the teachings of history, can forecast the changes that the
establishment of the principle involve 1 will work in our state
and National life, or what kind of government we will have,
when these principles thus sanctioned shall hereafter be invoked and applied.
From the account of the debates in Congress it appears that
in both Houses it was understood that the act applied to all
commerce: See Record, January 30, 1906, Vol. 40, Pt. 2,
1747; Pt. 5, 4602 et seq.
Mr. Alexander P. Humphrey, with whom Mr. R. S. Lovett
and Mr. Maxwell Evarts were on the brief, for defendant in
error in No. 222:
The Employers' Liability Act is unconstitutional. It is
not competent for Congress to regulat6eall t!he".commerce of a
common carrier whether interstate or intrastate. If the line
of a carrier is wholly within a State it carries on intrastate
commerce, but may in connection with other carriers carry
on interstate commerce: C., N. 0. & T. P. Railway v. Int.
Com. Comm., 162 U. S. 191. The power which Congress has
is to regulate commerce and there is a marked distinction between that power and a power to regulate the affairs of an individual or corporation engaged in interstate commerce. If
Congress has power to pass this law it derives it from § 3 of
Article \1Il of the Constitutioni, the commerce clause. As to

the limit of this power, see Gibbons v. Ogden-,9 Wheat. 1, 194;
Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 96; Wabash Railway v. Illinois,
118 U. S. 565. And see the cases cited in the brief for defendant in error in No. 216, holding that a carrier engaged
generally in interstate commerce is subject to state control
as to its intrastate business. See also Hall v. DeCuir, 95
U. S.485; Louisville Railway v. Mississippi, 133 U. S. 587;
Plessy .v.
Ferguson, 163 U. S.537; Ches. & Ohio v. Kentucky,
179 U. S. 388, holding that it is competent for a State to separate the races into separate compartments or cars so long as
such state regulations are confined to intrastate points. As
to power of the State to require railroad trains to stop at state
stations, see Gladson v. Minnesota, 166 U. S.427, 430; Illinois
Central R. R. Co. v. Illinois, 163 U. S.142; Lake Shore Railway
v. Ohio, 173 U. S.285; C. C. C. & St. L. Railway v. Illinois,

. As to power of States over rates see Louisville & Nashville
v. Kentucky, 183 U. S.503; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v.
Eubank, 184 U. S.27.
If determining the liability of a carrier to its employ6s is
a regulation of commerce at all, Congress can only determine
it so far as it relates to interstate commerce.
The Employers' Liability Act is not a regulation of commerce at all. It relates simply to one of the ordinary relations
of life-and the legal rules affecting such -relations are within
the control of the States. Under the common law there is no
remedy where an individual having been injured through the
negligence of another dies after the hurt. Insurance Co. v.
Brame, 95 U. S. 754; The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, 204.
Every State, however, has passed laws giving the personal
representatives of the injured employ6 an action against the
employer-and this has been done as a matter of purely
domestic concern. The States have also, as they have the
right to do, passed statutes as to the effect of negligence by
fellow-servants; Southern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schoer, 114 Fed.

When cases have come to this court involving the question
whether a particular state law is a regulation of interstate
commerce, the question has been: Does the state law put a
burden on interstate traffic? Examples of these cases are
found in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 420; Leisy v. Hardin,
135 U. S. 100; Robbins v. Taxing District of Shelby, 120 U. S.
489. Or the question' has been: Does the state law place a
burden on interstate transportation? Examples of this class
are found in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 196; Crandall
v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35; Wabash R. R. v. Illinois, 118 U. S. 557.
The act is simply a bold attempt to regulate one of the
ordinary relations of life, that of master and servant, a relation hitherto supposed to be entirely within the control 'of the
State. If Congress can thus take hold of the relation of master and servant, it can with equal power take hold of the relation of guardian and ward and other domestic relations.
This law is different from the Anti-trust Law, the Meat
Inspection Law and the Pure Food Law, the Interstate Commerce Law, and the Safety Appliance Law, in that those laws
regulate the instrumentalities of commerce and not domestic
relations, and this act does hot prescribe any rule by which
it is to be governed or intercourse carried on.
Although some of the cases sustaining congressional legislation as to liability of shipowners have been based on the
commerce clause the real basis of power in that respect is the
admiralty and maritime clause of the Constitution. See Ex
parte Garnett, 141 U. 5. 1; The Roanoke, 189 U. S. 185; The

The act embraces employ6s of all kinds, and it being separable was the evident intention of Congress not to confine the
act to any class of employ~s, but to embrace all of the employ6s of a carrier within the terms of the act. This brings it
under the rule that statutes partly constitutional and partly
unconstitutional, are entirely void unless the unconstitutional
can be plainly separated from the constitutional provision.

MR. JusTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.1

To dispose of these cases it is necessary to decide a fundamental question which is equally decisive as to both. They
were argued at the bar together, and because of their unity
have been considered at the same time.
As stated in the declarations as finally amended, recovery
was sought in each case of damages occasioned by the death of
the respective intestates while serving as a fireman on a locomotive actually engaged in moving an interstate commerce
train. In each of the cases it was alleged that the intestate met
his death through no fault of his, but solely through the fault
of employds of the company, who were his fellow servants.
In both the right of action was expressly based upon the act of
Congress of July 11, 1906, entitled "Nn Act relating to liability of common carriers in the District of Columbia and
Territories and common carriers engaged in commerce between
the States and between the States and foreign nations to their
employ6s." By demurrer in each of the cases the act relied
upon was assailed as being repugnant to the Constitution of

the United States. In both cases the Department of Justice, on
behalf of the United States, asked to be allowed io intervene
for the purpose of supporting the constitutionality of the act.
In the first (the Howard) case this request was granted. In
the second (the Brooks) case the Court, while denying the request upon the ground that it knew of no law authorizing such
an intervention simply because the validity of an act of Congress was drawn in question, nevertheless permitted the United States to be heard as a friend of the court. In both eases
the act was held to be unconstitutional, the demurrer was sustained and the declarations dismissed. These direct writs of
error were then prosecuted, and at bar the cases have been
argued, by printed brief and orally, not only by the parties in
interest, but on behalf of the United States through the Attorney General as a friend of the court.
As the issue to be decided is whether the courts below were
right in holding that the act of Congress, which was the basis
of the respective causes of action, was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, we reproduce the text of that
act in the margin.'

Opinion of the Court.

Before coming to consider the contentions concerning the
constitutionality of the act, we notice certain suggestions which
proceed upon the assumption that they may concern the issue
for decision. It is said that the statute inordinately extends
the power of Congress and unduly diminishes the legislative
authority of the States, since it seeks to exert the powo,' ' f
Congress as to the relation of master and servant, I subject
hitherto treated as being exclusively within the control of the
States, and that in practice its execution will cripple the State
and enlarge the Federal judicial power, since its effect will
be to cause every action concerning an injury to a servant employed by a common carrier who may engage in interstate
commerce to cease to be a matter of state jurisdiction and to
be cognizable in the Federal courts. Moreover, it is said, the
statute will create confusion and uncertainiy as to the rights
of those dwelling within the States, that it will operate injuriously upbn all who choose to engage in interstate commerce
injuries have resulted in his death, the fact that the cmploy6 may have
been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery whet,' his
contributory negligence was slight and that of the employer was gross in
comparison, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion
to the anmount of negligence attributable to such emnploy6. All questions
of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury.
Sc. 3. That no contract of employment., insurance, relief, benefit, or
indemnity for injury or death entered into by or on behalf of any cmoploy6,

as a common carrier, since those who so do will become subject to the liability which the statute creates, to be tested by
the rules of negligence which the statute embodies, although
such rules be unknown to the laws of the several States. Besides, the statute, it is urged, discriminates against all who
engage as. common carriers in interstate commerce, since it
makes them responsible without limit as to the amount to one
servant for an injury suffered by the acts of a co-servant, even
in a case where the negligence of the injured servant has contributed to the result, hence placing all employers who are
common carriers in a disfavored and all their employ~s in a
favored class. Indeed it is insisted the statute proceeds upon
contradictory principles, since it imposes the increased responsibility just stated upon the master presumably in order to make
Him more careful in the selection of his servants, and yet
minimizes the necessity for care on the part of the servant by
allowing recovery, although he may have been negligent.
But, without even for the sake of argument conceding the
correctness of these suggestions, we at once dismiss them from
consideration as concerning merely the expediency of the act
and not the power of Congress to enact it. We say this since,
in testing the constitutionality of the act, we must confine
ourselves to the power to pass it and may not consider evils
which it is supposed will arise from the execution of the law,
whether they be real or imaginary.
All the questions which arise concern the nature and extent
of the power of Congress to regulate commerce. That subject
has been so often here considered and has been so fully elaborated in recent decisions, two of which are roted in the margin,'
that we content ourselves, for the purposes of this case, with
repeating the broad definition of the commerce power as expounded by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden,
9 Wheat. 1, 196, where he said:
"We are now arrived at the inquiry, What is this power?
I Lotteny Case, 138 U. S. 321, 345 et seq.; NorthernScurities Co. v. United
States, 193 IT. S. 197. 335, and cases cited.

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.
207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by
which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others
vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to
its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than
are prescribed in the Constitution. ......
If, as has always
been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited
to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over
commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States,
is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single
government, having in its constitution the 'same restrictions.
on the exercise of the power as are found in the Constitution
of the United States."
Accepting, as we now do and as has always been done, this
comprehensive statement of -the power of Congress, we also
adopt and reiterate the perspicuous statement made in the
same case (p. 194),.of those matters of state control which are
not embraced in the grant of authority to'Congress to regulate
commerce:
"It is not intended to say that these wowuz comprehend that
commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on
between man and man in a State, or between different parts
of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other
States. Such a power would be inconvenient and is certainly
unnecessary. Comprehensive as the word 'among' is, it may
very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns
more States than one.
.
The genius and character of
the whole Government seem to be, that its action is to be
applied to all the external concerns of the Natioi, and to those
internal concerns which affect the States generally; but not to
those which are completely within a particular State, which
do not affect other States, and with which it is not necessary9
to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the. general
powers of the Government."
We thitik the orderly discussion of the question may best be
met oy disposing of the affirmative propositions relied on to
estaAlish that 'he statute conflicts with the Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.
Opinion of the Court.

207 U. S.

In the first place, it is asserted that there is a total want of
power in Congress in any conceivable aspect to regulate the
subject with which the ct deals. In the second place it is
insisted the act is void, even although it be conceded, for the
sake of argument, that some phases of the subject with which
it is concerned may be within the power of Congress, because
the act is confined not to such phaqes,, but asserts control over
many things not in any event within the power to regulate
commerce.
While it may be, if we indulged, for the sake of argument,
in the hypothesis of limited power upon which the second
proposition rests, it would result that a consideration of the
first proposition would be unnecessary because the act would
be found to be repugnant to the Constitution, because embracing provisions beyond such assumed and restricted authority we do not think we are at liberty to avoid deciding
whether, in any possible aspect, the subject to which the act
relates is within the power of Congress. We say this, for if it
be that from the nature of the subject no power whatever
over the same can, under any conceivable circumstances, be
possessed by Congress, we ought to so declare, and not by
an attempt to conceive the inconceivable assume the existence of some authority, thus it may be, misleading Congress
and giving rise to future contention.
.1. The proposition that there is an absolute want of power
in Congress to enact the statute is based on the assumption
that as the statute is solely addressed to the regulation of
the relations of the employer to those whom he employs and
the ielation of those employed by him among themselves,
it deals with subjects which cannot under any circumstances
come within the power conferred upon Congress to regulate
commerce.
As it is patent that the act does regulate the relation of
master and servant in the cases to which it applies, it must
follow, that the act is beyond the authority of Congress if the
proposition just stated be well founded. But we may not

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.
207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

test the power of Congress to regulate commerce solely by
abstractly considering the particular subject to which a regulation relates, irrespective of whether the regulation in question
is one of interstate commerce. On the contrary, the test of
power is not merely the matter regulated, but whether the
regulation is directly one of interstate commerce, or is embraced
vithin the grant conferred on Congress to use all lawful means
necessary and appropriate to the execution of the power to
regulate commerce. We think the unsoundness of the contention, that because the act regulates the relation of master
and servant, it is unconstitutional, because under no circumstances and to no extent can the regulation of such subject be
within the .gant of authority to regulate commerce, is demonstrable. We say this because we fail to perceive any just
reason for holding that Congress is without power to regulate
the relation of, master and servant, to the extent that regulations adopted by Congress on that subject are solely confined
to interstate commerce, and therefore are within the grant to
regulate that commerce or within the authority given to use
all means appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred.
To illustrate: Take the case of an interstate railway train, that
is, a train moving in interstate commerce, and the regulation
of which therefore is, in the nature of things, a regulation of
such commerce. It cannot be said that because a regulation
adopted by Congress as to such train when so engaged in interstate commerce deals with the relation of the master, to the
servants operating such train or the relations of the servants
engaged in such operation between themselves, that it is not a
regulation of interstate commerce. This must be, since to
admit the authority to regulate such train, and yet to say that
all regulations which deal with the relation of master and
servants engaged in its operation are invalid for want of power
would be but to concede the power and then to deny it., or at
all events to recognize the power and yet to render it incomplete.
Because of the reasons just stated we might well pass from
the consideration of the subject. We add, however, that we

207 U. S.

think the error of the proposition is shown by previous decisions of this court. Thus the want of power in a State to
interfere with an interstate commerce train, if thereby a direct
burden is imposed upon interstate commerce, is settled beyond
question. Mississippi R. R. Co. v. Illinois Cent. R. R., 203
U. S. 335, 343, and cases cited; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. v.
Wharton et al., Railroad Commissioners, 207 U. S. 328. And
decisions cited in the margin,1 holding that state statutes
which regulated the relation of master and servant were applicable to those actually engaged in an operation of interstate
commerce, because the state power existed until Congress
acted, by necessary implication, refute the contention that a
regulation of the subject, confined to interstate commerce,
when adopted by Congress would be necessarily void because
the regulation of the relation of master and servant was, however intimately connected with interstate commerce, beyond
the power of Congress. And a like conclusion also persuasively
results from previous rulings of this court concerning the act
of Congress, known as the Safety Appliance Act. Johnson v.
Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S. 1; Schlemmer v. Buffalo,
Rochester &c. Ry., 205 U. S. 1.
2. But it is argued, even though it be conceded that the
power of Congress may be exercised as to the relation of master
and servant in matters of interstate commerce, that power
cannot be lawfully extended so as to include the regulation
of the relation of master and servant, or of servants among
themselves, as to things which are not interstate commerce.
From this it is insisted the repugnancy of the act to the Constitution is clearly shown, as the face of the act makes it certain that the power which it asserts extends not only to the
relation. of master and servant and servants among themselves
as to things which are wholly interstate commerce, but emI Sherlock

braces those relations as to matters and things domestic in
their character and which do not come within the authority
of Congress. To test this proposition requires us to consider
the text of the act.
From the first section it is certain that the act extends to
every individual or corporation who may engage in interstate
commerce as a common carrier. Its all-embracing words leave
no room for any other conclusion. It may include, for example,
steam railroads, telegraph lines, telephone lines, the express
business, vessels of every kind, whether steam or sail, ferries,
bridges, wagon lines, carriages, trolley lines, etc. Now, the rule
which the statute establishes for the purpose of determining
whether all the subjects to which it relates are to be controlled
by its provisions is that any one who conducts such business
be a "common -carrier engaged in trade or commerce in the
District of Columbia, or in any Territory of the United States,
or between the several States," etc. That is, the subjects
stated all come, within the statute when the individual or
corporation is a common carrier who engages in trade or commerce between the States, etc. From this it follows that the
statute deals with all the concerns of the individuals or corporations to which it relates if they engage as common carriers in
trade or commerce between the States, etc., and does not confine itself to the interstate commerce business which may be
done by such persons. Stated in another form, the statute is
addressed to the individuals or corporations who are engaged
in interstate commerce and is not confined solely to regulating
the interstate commerce business which such persons may dothat is, it regulates the persons because they engage in interstate commerce and does not alone regulate the business of
interstate commerce.
And the conclusion thus stated, which flows from the text
of the act concerning the individuals or corporations to which
it is made to apply, is further demonstrated by a consideration
of the text of the statute defining the servants to whom it
relates.
VOL. covii-32

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.
Opinion of the Court.

207 U. S.

Thus the liability of a common carrier is declared to be in
favor of "any of its employ~s." As the word "any" is unqualified, it follows that liability to the servant is coextensive
with the business done by the employers whom the statute
embraces; that is, it is in favor of any of the employ~s of all
carriers who engage in interstate commerce. This also is the
rule as to the one who otherwise would be a fellow servant, by
whose negligence the injury or death may have been occasioned,
since it is provided that the right to recover on the part of any
servant will exist, although the injury for which the carrier
is to be held resulted from "the negligence of any of its officers,
agents or employ6s."
The act then being addressed to all common carriers engaged
in interstate commerce, and imposing a liability upon them
in favor of any of their employ~s, without qualification or restriction as to the business in which the carriers or their employ~s may be engaged at the. time ,of the injury, of necessity
includes subjects wholly outside of the poweil of Congress to
regulate commerce. Without stopping to consider the numerous instances where although a common carrier is engaged
in interstate commerce such carrier may in,the nature of things
also transact business nQt interstate commerce, although such
local business may indirectly be related to interstate commerce,
a few illustrations showing the operation of the statute as
to matters wholly independent of interstate commerce will
serve to make clear the extent of the power which is exerted
by the statute. Take a railroad engaged in interstate coinmerce, having a purely local branch operated wholly within
a State. Take again the same road having shops for repairs,
and it may be for construction work, as well as a large accounting and clerical force, and having, it may be, storage elevators and warehouses, not to suggest besides the possibility
of its being engaged in other independent enterprises. Take a
telegraph company engaged in the transmission of interstate
and local messages. Take an express company engaged in
local as well as in interstate business. Take a trolley line

moving wholly within a State as to a large part of its business
and yet as to the remainder crossing the state line.
As the act thus includes many subjects wholly beyond the
power to regulate commerce and depends for its sanction upon
that authority, it results that the act is repugnant to the Constitution, and cannot be enforced unless there be merit in the
propositions advanced to show that the statute may be saved.
On the one hand, while conceding that the act deals with all
common carriers who are engaged in interstate commerce because they so engage, and indeed, while moreover conceding
that the act was originally drawn for the purpose of reaching
all the employ6s of railroads engaged in interstate commerce
to which it is said the act in its original form alone related,
it is yet insisted that the act is within the power of Congress,
because one who engages in interstate commerce thereby
comes under the power of Congress as to all his business and
may not complain of any regulation which Congress may
choose to adopt. These contentions are thus summed up in
the brief filed on behalf of the Government:
"It is the carrierand not its employ~s that the act seeks to
regulate, and the carrier is subject to such regulations because
it is engaged in interstate commerce.
"By engaging in interstate commerce the carrier chooses to
subject itself and its business to the control of Congress, and
cannot be heard to complain of such regulations.
". It is submitted that Congress can make a common
carrier engaged in interstate commerce liable to any one for
its negligence who is affected by it; and if it can do that, necessarily it can make such carrier, liable to all of its employ~s."
On the other hand, the same brief insists that these propositions are irrelevant, because the statute may be interpreted
so as to ,onfine it., operation wholly to interstate commerce
or to meais appropriate to the regilation of that subject', and
hence relieves from the necessity of le(ieiding whether, if the
statute could not be so const rued, it would be constitutional.

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.
Opinion of the Court.

207 U. S.

in the oral discussion at bar this latter view was earnestly
insisted upon by the Attorney 'General. 'Assuming, as we do,
that the propositions are intended to be alternative, we disregard the order in which they are pressed in argument, and
therefore pass for a moment the consideration of the proposition
that the statute is constitutional, though it includes all the
subjects which we have found it to embrace, in order to weigh
the contention that it is susceptible on its face of a different
meaning from that which we have given it, or that such result
pan be accomplished by the application of the rules of interpretation which are relied upon.
So far as the face of the statute is concerned, the argument
is this, that because the statute says carriers engaged in commer'ce between the States, etc., therefore the 'act should be
interpreted as being exclusively applicabie to the interstate
commerce business and none other of such carriers, and that
the words "any employ6" as found in the statute should be
held to mean any employ6 when such eqiploy6 is engaged only,
in interstate commerce. But this would require us to write
into the statute words of limitation and restriction not found
in it. But if we could bring ourselves to modify the statute
by writing in the words suggested the result would be to restrict the operation of the act as to the District of Columbia
and the Territories. We say this because immediately preceding the provision of the act concerning carriers engaged in
commerce between the States and Territories is a clause making it applicable to "every common carrier engaged in trade
or commerce in the District of Columbia or in any Territory
of the United States." It follows, therefore, that common
carriers in such Territories, even although not engaged in
interstate commerce, are by the act made liable to ."any" of
their employ~s, as therein defined. The legislative power of
Congress over the District of Columbia and the Territories
being plenary and not depending upon the interstate commerce
c'lause, it results that the provision as to the District of Columbia and the Territories, if standing alone, could not be ques-

Opinion of the Court.

tioned. Thus it would come to pass, if we could bring ourselves
to modify the statute by writing in the words suggested; that
is, by causing the act to read "any employ6 when engaged in
interstate commerce," we would restrict the act as to the District of Columbia and the Territories, and thus destroy it in
an important particular. To write into the act the qualifying
words, therefore, would be but adding to its provisions in order
to save it in one aspect, and thereby to destroy it in another;
that is, to destroy in order to save and to save in order to
destroy.
The principles of construction invoked are undoubted, but
are inapplicable. Of course, if it can be lawfully done, our
duty is to construe the statute so as to repder it constitutional.
But this does not imply, if the text of an act is unambiguous,
that it may be rewritten to accomplish that purpose. Equally
clear is it, generally speaking, that where a statute contains
provisions which are constitutional and others which are not,
effect may be given to the legal provisions by separating them
from the illegal. But this applies only to a case where the provisions are separable and not dependent one upon the other,
and does not support the contention that that which is indivisible may be divided. Moreover, even in a case where
legal provisions may be severed from those which are illegal, in
order to save the rule applies only where it is plain that Congress would have enacted the legislation 'with the unconstitutional provisions eliminated. All these principles are so
clearly settled as not to be open to controversy. They were all,
after a full review of the authorities, restated and reapplied in
a recent case. Illinois Central Railroad v. McKendree, 203
U. S. 514, and authorities there cited.
As the act before us by its terms relates to every common
carrier engaged in interstate commerce and to any of the eniploy~s of every such carrier, thereby regulating every relation
of a carrier engaged in interstate commerce with its servants
and of such servants among themselves, we are unable to say
,hat the statute would have been enacted had its provisions

207 U. S.

been restricted to the limited relations of that character which
it was within the power of Congress to regulate. On this subject the opinion in the Trade-inark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, where
an act of Congress concerning trade-marks was held to be unconstitutional, because too broad in its scope, is pertinent and
instructive. The court said (p. 99):
"If we should, in the case before us, undertake to make by
judicial construction a law which Congress did not make, it is
quite probable we should (1o what, if the matter were now
before that body, it would be unwilling to do; namely, make a
trade-mark law which is only- partial in its operation, and
which would complicate the rights which parties would hold,
in some instances under the act of Congress, and illothers
understate law. Cooley, Const. Lin. 178, 179; Commonwealth v.
Hitchings, 5 Gray (Mass.), 482."
3. It remains only to consid(er the contention which we have
previously quoted, that the act is constitutional, although it
embraces subjects not within the power of Congress to regulate
commerce, because one who engages in interstate commerce
thereby submits all his business concerns to the regulating
power of Congress. To state the proposition is to refute it.
It assumes that because one engages in interstate commerce
he thereby endows Congress with power not delegated to it
by the Constitution, in other words, with the right to legislate

conception that the Constitution (lestroyed that freedomnof
commerce which it was its purpose to preserve, since it treats
the right to eigage in interstate commerce as a privilege which
cannot be availe~d of except upon such conditions as Congress
may prescribe, even although the conditions would be otherwise beyond the l)owevr of Congress. It is apparent that if
the coitentiom were well founded it would extend the power of
Congress to every conceivable subject, however inherently
local, would obliterate all the limitations of power imposed by
the Constitution, and would destroy the authority of the
States as to all conceivable matters which from the beginning

4. Reference was made to the report of a committee submitted to the House of Representatives on the coming in of
the bill which finally became the act in question. We content
ourselves on this subject with saying that that report, we think,
instead of adding force to the argument that .the plain terms
of the act should be disregarded, tends to the contrary. And
the same observation is appropriate to the reference made to
the text of the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, 27
Stat. 531, which, it is insisted, furnishes a guide which, if
followed, would enable us to disregard the text of the act. We
*say this because the face of that act clearly refutes the argument based upon it. It is true that the act, like the one we are
considering, is addressed to every common carrier engaged in
interstate commerce, but this direction is followed by provisions expressly limiting the scope and effect of the act to
interstate commerce, which are wholly superfluous if the argument here made concerning the statute before us be sound.
We deem it unnecessary to pass upon the merits of the contentions -concerning the alleged repugnancy of the statute, if
regarded as otherwise valid, to the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, because the act classifies
together all common carriers. Although we deem it unnecessary to consider that subject, it must not be implied that
we question the correctness of previous decisions noted in the
margin, 1 wherein state statutes were held not to be repugnant
to the Fourteenth Amendment, although they classified steam
railroads in one class for the purpose of applying a rule of
master and servant. We further deem it unnecessary to express an opinion concerning the alleged repugnancy of the
statute to the Seventh Amendment, because of the provision
of the act as to the power of the jury. In saying this, however, we must not be considered as intimating that we think

the provision in question is susceptible of the construction
placed on it in argument, or that if it could be so construed it
would be constitutional.
Concluding, as we do, that the statute, whilst it embraces
subjects within the authority of Congress .to regulate commerce, also includes subjects not within its constitutional power,
and that the two are so interblended in the statute that they
are incapable of separation, we are of the opinion that the
courts below rightly held the statute to be repugnant to the
Constitution and non-enforcible; and the judgments below are,

Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE DAY concurs in this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, concurring.

I concur in the result of the foregoing opinion, but I am not
prepared to agree with all that is stated as to the power of
Congress to legislate upon the subject of the relations between
master and servant.
I concur in the proposition, that as to traffic or other matters
within the State, the act is unconstitutional, and it cannot be
separated from that part which is claimed to be valid as relating
to interstate commerce. As that is all that it is necessary to
decide in this case, I place my concurrence upon that part of
the opinion which decides it.
I am authorized to state that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr.
Justice BREWER agree in this view.

I am unable to agree in the judgment of the court. Under

law, which may be readily qhanged by the lawmaking branches

ion may well be left without expression. But where the judgment is a judicial condemnation of an act of a co6rdinate
branch of our Government it is so grave a step that no menibei of the court can escape his own responsibility, or be justified
in uppressing his own views, if unhappily they have not found
expression in those of his associates. Moved by this consideration, and solicitous to maintain what seem to me the lawful
powers of the Nation, I have no doubt of my duty to disclose
fully the opinions which, to my regret, differ in some respects
from those of some of my brethren.
The only question which these cases present is the constitutionality of the Employers' Liability Act, which, briefly
stated, provides a remedy for the injury or death of the employ6s of -territorial, interstate and foreign common carriers,
caused by the negligence of the carrier. The defepdants were
both interstate carriers, and these actions were brought to
recover for the deaths of their employ~s who, at the time,
were engaged in interstate transportation. The judgment of
the court does not deny that it is within the power of the
Congress to provide a remedy for the injury or death of employds engaged in the conduct of territorial, interstate and
foreign commerce. It rests upon the ground that this statute
is unconstitutional, because it seeks to do more than that,
and regulates the liability of employers while engaged in intrastate commerce or in manufacture. At the threshold I may
say that I agree that the Congress has not the power directly
to regulate the purely .internal commerce of the States, and
that I understand that to be the opinion of every member of
the court.
The constitutionality of the act was attacked in the arguments before us upon three grounds. First, because it seeks
to control by provisions so inseparable that they are incapable
of resolution into their several parts, not only the territorial,
foreign and interstate business of carriers, but also their intrastate business, which, by the Constitution, is reserved for the
government of the States. Second, because, if the act should

be interpreted as not intruding upon the domain of the States
by directly regulating commerce exclusively within the States,
yet, that legislation fixing the obligation of employers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to their employ6s
in such commerce, for injuries suffered by the latter in the
course of .the employment, is not the regulation of commerce,
and, therefore, is not within any power conferred by the
Constitution upon Congress. Third, because, even if the act
is concerned with a subject which is within the power of Congress, yet the specific changes made by it in the common law
rules governing the relations of employer and employ6 exceed
the legislative power or violate the constitutional prohibition.which restrict that power.
I am of opinion that the act is not open to any of the' constitutional objections urged against it, and shall consider all
of the objections in the order in which I have stated them.
In the consideration of the scope of the statute for the purpose of determining whether it seeks to control that part of
commerce which is beyond the power of Congress and subject
only to the government of the States, it is to be observed that
the opening words of Congress are in recognition of the limitation of its authority and of the constitutional distinction
between commerce among the States and with foreign nations
on the one hand and commerce within the States on the other
hand. The commands of the law are addressed only to" common carriers engaged in trade and commerce" in the Territories,
with foreign nations, and among the States, and with respect
to carriers engaged in commerce within the States the law is
impressively silernt. The expression and enumeration of the
parts of commerce which are clearly within the control of
Con'gres is equivalent to an exclusion of the part which is not
within its control. In the careful selection of the language
of 'this law the legislators may well have had in mind the
words of Chief Justice Marshall which have received the con..stant approval of this court. He said (in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 194, 195)"

the States cannot stop at the external boundary line of each

"It is not intended to say that these words comprehend
that commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried
on between man and man in a State, or between different parts
of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other
States. Such a power would be inconvenient, and is certainly
unnecessary.
"Comprehensive as the word'among' is, it may very properly
be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States
than one. The phrase is not one which would probably have
been selected to indicate the completely interior traffic of a
State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and
the enumeration of the particular classes of commerce to
which the power was to be extended would not have been
made had the intention been to extend the power to every
(lescription. The enumeration presupposes something not
enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language
or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal
commerce of a State.. The genius and character of the whole
Government seem to be, that its action is to be applied to all
the external concerns of the Nation, and to those internal
concerns which affect the States generally; but not to those
which are completely within a particular State, which do not
affect other States, and with which it is not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers
of the Government. The completely, internal commerce of a
State then, may be considered as reserved to the State itself."
These words of the Chief Justice have been regarded as
delimiting accurately the constitutional boundaries of the respective powers over commerce of the Nation and the States.

easy to believe that Congress intended to dispute their authority. The reasoning which was thought worthy for the
interpretation of the Constitution will not be misapplied if it
be employed in the interpretation of a law passed in pursuance
of the powers conferred by the Constitution. Why should it
not be said of the law as it was said of the Constitution, that
"the enumeration of the particular classes of commerce to which
the power was to be extended, would not have been made
had the intention been to extend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language,
must be the exclusively internal commerce of the State."
From the enumeration of territorial, interstate, and foreign
commerce, and the omission of the internal commerce of
the State, is it not clear that the commerce which is exclusively internal to the State, and does not affect any other
character of commerce, was intended to be outside the purview
of the law? Does not a proper respect for the acts of Congress and the strong presumption that it will not exceed its
powers, so frequently declared by this court, require us to
believe that when the kinds of commerce within its undoubted
control are carefully enumerated all the words of the law,
however general, are to be referred solely to that commerce
and no other?
If carriers were separated by a clear line of division, so that
one class were engaged exclusively in interstate and foreign
commerce, and the other class were engaged exclusively in
commerce within the States, it would not, of course, occur to
any mind that this act had any reference whatever to the state
carriers. But there is no such hard and fast line of division.
Carriers often, and where they are railroads, usually are, as a
matter of fact, engaged both in interstate and foreign commerce over which Congress has the control, and intrastate
commerce over which the States have the control. Applying
the law under consideration to the conditions as they actually
exist, it is said that its words are so general and sweeping as

MOODY,

to comprehend within its benefits not only the employds of
the interstate carrier engaged in the business of interstate
carriage, but also the employds of the same oarrier engaged
in the business of intrastate carriage which it may and usually
does conduct. Counsel illustrated their argument by suggesting that if a carrier doing an interstate business on the Pacific
slope also conducted a local trolley line wholly along the
Atlantic seaboard within a single State, an employ6 on the
local trolley line would, by the terms of this act, be entitled
to its benefits. If such be the necessary interpretation of the
statute plainly it exceeds the power of Congress, for Congress
certainly has no right to regulate the purely internal commerce of a State. Nor can the statute be saved by rejecting
that part of it which is unconstitutional because its provisions
are single and incapable of separation. The vicious part, if
such exist, is so intermingled with that which is good that it
cannot be eliminated without destroying the whole structure.
Which interpretation, then,. should be adopted? That
which regards the law as prescribing the liability of the carrier
only to those employ6s who are engaged in the work of interstate and. foreign commerce, or that which extends the benefits
of the law also to those employds engaged in work which has
no relation whatever to such commerce. In answering this
question it must not be forgotten that, if the latter interpretation'be adopted, in the opinion of the -whole court the act is
beyond the constitutional power of Congress. That is a consideration of vast importance, because the court has never
exercise-i the mighty power of declaring the acts of a coordinate branch of the Goiernment void except where there
is no possible and sensible construction of the act which is
consistent with the fundamental organic law. The presumption that other branches of the Government will restrain
themselves within the scope of their authority, and the respect
which is due to them and their acts, admits of no other attitude
from this court. 'This is more than a canon of interpretation,
it' is a rule of conduct resting upon considerations of public

policy, and, in the exercise of the delicate function of condenining the acts of co6rdinate and equal branches of the
Government, under the same obligation to respect the Constitution as ourselves, has been observed from the beginning.
I regard the rule as so vital and fundamental in this and all
other parts of the case that I select almost at random some
expressions of it by different justices of this court. When the
power to declare an act of Congress void was still undecided,
Mr. Justice Chase said in Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171,
p. F75: "If the court have such power, I am free to declare that
I will never exercise it, but in a very, clear case." Mr. Justice Strong said in The Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, p. 531:
"It isincumbent, therefore, upon those who affirm the unconstitutionality of an act of Congress to show clearly that
it is in violation of the provisions of the Constitution. It is
not sufficient for them that they succeed in raising a doubt."
In The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, Mr. Justice Miller
said, p. 96: "When this court is called on in the course of the
administration of the law to consider whether an act of Con-

gress, or any other department of the Government, is within
the constitutional authority of that department, a due respect
for a coordinate branch of the Government requires that we
shall decide that it has transcended its powers only when that
is so plain that we cannot avoid the duty." In Nicol v. Ames,
173 U. S. 509, Mr. Justice Peckham said, p. 514: "It is always
an exceedingly grave and delicate duty to decide upon the
constitutionality of an act of the Congress of the United States.
The presumption, as has frequently been said, is in favor of
the validity of the act, and it is only when the question is free
from any reasonable doubt that the court should hold an act,
-f the lawmaking power of the Nation to be in violation of that
fundamental instrument upon which all the powers of the
Government rest." Mr. Justice White in Buttfield v. Stranahan,
192 U. S. 470, said, p. 492: "In examining the statute in order
to determine its constitutionality we must be guided by the
will-set tled rule that every intendment is in favor of its validity,

It must be presumed to be constitutional, unless its repu1gnancy
to the Constitution clearly appears." Mr. Chief Justice Waite
in The,. Sinking Fund qases, 99 U. S. 700, said, p. 718: "It is
our duty, when required in the regular course of judicial proceedings, to declare an act of Congress void if not within the
legislative power of the United States; but this declaratic
should never be made except in a clear case. Every possible
presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this
continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt.
One branch of the Government cannot encroach upon the
domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on a strict observance of
this salutary rule." Mr. Justice Story, in United States v.
Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, said, p. 76: "If the section admits of two
interpretations, one of which brings it within and the other
presses it beyond the constitutional authority of Congress, it
will become our duty to adopt the' former construction; because a presumption never ought to be indulged, that Congress
meant to exercise or usurp any unconstitutional authority, unless that conclusion is forced upon the court by language altogether unambiguous."
Citations of this character might be multiplied, but to no
good purpose. There is no doubt that the rule exists, there
is no doubt that it is wise, and promotes the mutual respect
between the different branches of the Government which is so
essential to the welfare of all, and that it requires us, if it is
within our power, to give to the words of the statute before
us a meaning which will confine its provisions to subjects
within the control of Congress. If two interpretations are
possible our plain duty is to adopt that which sustains the
statute as a lawful exercise of authority and not that which
condemns it as a usurpation.
The argument which supports a construction of the statite
which would include within its provisions intrastate cdmmerce is readily stated. It is said that "every common carrier" engaged in territorial, foreign, or interstate trade is made

for all damages which

may result from the negligence of any of its officers, agents,
or employds, or by reason of any defect" in its instrumentalities,
and that, as there is no qualification of or exception to the
generality of the language descriptive of the employ6s or instrumentalities, it must be deemed to include those engaged
and used solely in intrastate commerce, and even in manufacture, as well as those engaged and used in other commerce.
But I venture to think that this argument rests upon too
narrow ground. It contemplates merely the words of the
statute; it shuts out the light which the Constitution sheds
upon them; it overlooks the significance of the enumeration
of the kinds of commerce clearly-within the National control
and the omission of the commerce beyond that control-an
enumeration and omission which characterizes, colors and restrains every word of the Statute-and it neglects the presumptions in favor of the validity of the law and of the obedience of Congress to the commands of the Constitution, which
cannot with propriety be. disregarded by this court. Taking
into account these missing aids to construction, it becomes
quite easy, quite reasonable, and, in my opinion, quite necessary, to construe the act as conferring its benefits only upon
employ6s engaged in some fashion in the commerce which is
enumerated in it and is undoubtedly under the control of
Congress. Even without these guides for discovering the intent of Congress, which the uniform practice of the court compels us to use, it is natural to suppose that, when territorial,
interstate, and foreign carriers only are mentioned and every
such carrier is declared to be liable "to any of its employ6s,"
only its employ6s in such commerce are intended. With those
guides the conclusion appears to me irresistible, for they show
that if the words, "any of its employds," in the context where
they are used, are capable of meaning all of the employds
upon any kind of work, yet their generality should be restrained
so as to include only those who are subject to the power of the
lawmaking. body. The case of McCullough v. Virginia, 172

THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES.
207 U. S.

MOODY,

dissenting.

U. S. 102, is precisely in point here. An act of the General
Assembly of the State of Virginia provided for refunding the
state debt by the issue of coupon bonds for two-thirds of the
total amount of that debt. It was enacted that the coupons
should "be receivable at and after maturity for all taxes,
debts, dues, and demands due the State." There was at the
time of the 'passage of the refunding act a provision of the
constitution of Virginia requiring all school taxes to be paid
in cash, and it had been held by this court that the constitutional provision disabled the Virginia legislature from providing that the coupons should be receivable for such taxes.
McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U. S.662. The argument was then
made that as the statute providing for the receivability of the
coupons for "all taxes, debts, dues, and demands due the
State" was in part beyond the constitutional power of the
legislature, the contract evidenced by that statute was entirely
void. The court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, answered
this argument by saying, 172 U. S.112: "It ignores the difference between. the statute and the contract, and confuses the
two entirely distinct matters of construction and validity.
The statute precedes the contract. Its scope and meaning must
be determined before any question will arise as to the validity
of the contract which it authorizes. It is elementary law that
every statute is to be read in the light of the Constitution.
However broad and general its language, it cannot be interpreted as extending beyond those matters which it Was within
the constitutional power of the legislature to reach. It is the
same rule which obtains in the interpretation of any private
contract between individuals. That, whatever may be its
words, is always to be construed in the light of the statute;
of the law then in force; of the circumstances and conditions
of parties. So, although general language was introduced into
the statute of 1871, it is not to be read as reaching to matters
in respect to which the legislature had no constitutional power,
but only as to those matters within its control. And if there
were, as it seems there were, certain special taxes and dues

which under the existing provisions of the state constitution
could not -be affected by legislative action, the statute is to
be read as though it in terms excluded them from its operation." The language quoted was not obiter. The case turned
upon the construction of the statute and reversed the construction by the highest court of the State of its own statute,
as well as its judgment, that the statute thus construed Was
inconsistent with the state constitution, because "all taxes"
included taxes beyond the power of the legislature. I am
unable, to reconcile the judgment in that case with the conclusion which is reached by the court in this. The reasoning
which, in that case, led the court to construe a statute providing that the coupons should be receivable for "all taxes" to
mean only for such taxes as the legislature had the constitutional power to declare payable in such a manner, is equally
potent to lead the court, in the case at bar, to construe a
statute providing for the liability of the interstate and foreign
carrier to "any of its employ6s" to mean only to any of its
employds for whom Congress has the constitutional power to
make such a provision. In that case there were taxes within
the legislative control, and taxes without the legislative control of the Virginia assembly; in this case there are employs
within the legislative control and employ6s without the legislative control of Congress; in that case the statute provided
for "all taxes';" in this case the statute provides for "any
employds;" in that case, examining the statute "in the light
of the Constitution," this court declared that "however broad
and general its language, it cannot be interpreted as extending beyond those matters which it is within the constitutional
power -of the legislature to reach," and if it appears that there
were taxes beyond the control of the legislature, that the statute should be read "as though it in terms excluded them from
its operation;" I am unable to imagine any reason why, examining the statute in this case with the aid of the same light,
the court should not make the same declaration of its meaning.
Moreover, it should be remembered that a circumstance lead-

ing in the same direction is present in the case at bar which
was absent in that case, for, to repeat what has already been
said, here the general words are used in a context which suggests, if it does not require, the less extended meaning.
It should be observed that the McCullough case was simply
a case of construction. The court made no judicial amendment of the statute or exception from its provisions of any
subject which, came within them according to their proper
meaning, ascertained with the aid of the light of the constitutional limits of the legislative power. Mr. Justice Brewer
pointed out -the distinction between the construction of the
statute and its validity, saying: "The statute precedes the
contract. Its scope and meaning must be determined before
any question will arise as to the validity of the contract which
it authorizes." Thus the case is distinguished from some others,
much relied upon in the argument, which establish the proposition, that a single statutory provision is void if it is expressed
in general words so used as to manifest clearly the intention
to include within those words subjects beyond the constitutional power of the lawmaking body. The courts have no
power to read into such a provision an exception for the
purpose of saving that which is left froit condemnation. A
law which cannot endure the test of the Constitution without
judicial amendment must perish. United States v. Reese, 92
U. S.- 214; The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82; United States
v. Harris,.106 U. S. 629; Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U. S. 678;
United States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S. 253. Sei Illinois &c. Railroad v. McKendree, 203 U. S. 514. But the rule derived' from
these cases is by no means decisive of the inquiry whether this
statute must be construed as seeking to accomplish objects
beyond the power of Congress. It can be made decisive only
by begging the very question to be determined, and, in the
words of Mr. Justice Brewer, confusing "the two entirely
distinct matters of construction and validity." It merely expresses the judicial duty which arises after the question of
construction is determined, A critical examination of the

MooDY, J., dissenting.

207 U. S.

cases shows that in each of them, in the opinion of the court,
the language of the statute admitted of no possible interpretation, except that Congress intended to deal, by a single and
inseparable provision, with subjects without as well as subjects within its control. As was said in one of them, United
States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 220, there was "no room for construction unless it be as to the effect of the Constitution." It
would be unprofitable to dwell upon all these decisions, and I
content myself with the analysis of one, and that the one
deemed by counsel who rely upon it as the most important
and conclusive. In The Trade-mark cases it appeared that in
an act entitled "An Act to Revise, Consolidate, and Amend
the Statutes Relating to Patents and Copyrights," provision
was made for the registration of trade-marks in the Patent
Office. Some years later an act was passed providing for the
punishment by fine and imprisonment of any person making
fraudulent use of or counterfeiting trade-marks thus registered.
The cases were indictments under this later act, and the question for decision was its constitutionality. The act was supported first upon the ground that it was authorized by that
part of the Constitution which confers upon Congress the
authority "to promote the progress of science and -useful arts,
by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective rights and. discoveries."
The court, after saying, 100 U. S.93, "that it is a reasonable
inference that this part of the statute also was in the opinion
of Congress an exercise of the power found in that clause of
the Constitution," and that "it was mainly if not wholly to
this clause that the advocates of the law looked for its support," held that this clause was not a sufficient source of authority for the act. The.act was supported, second, upon the
ground that the commerce clause of the Constitution supplied
the requisite authority t6 Congress. But there was not a word in
the act from which it could be inferred that Congress intended
to exercise the power conferred by the commerce clause.
The court, by Mr. Justice Miller, after pointing out that

commerce within a State. was beyond the control of Congress,
said, p. 96: "When, therefore, Congress undertakes to enact
a law, which can only be valid as a regulation of commerce,
it is reasonable to expect to find on the face of the law, or from
its essential nature, that it is a regulation of commerce with
foreign nations, among the several States, or with the Indian
tribes." Words could not be more happily chosen than these,
to describe what the statute in the case at bar is on its face
and from its essential nature. The justice then proceeds to
say: "If it is not so limited it is in excess of the power of Congress. If its main purpose be to establish a regulation applicable to all trade, to commerce at all points, especially if it
is apparent that it is designed to govern the commerce wholly
between citizens of the same State, it is obviously the exercise
of a power not confided to Congress." No words could be more
happily chosen than these, to describe exactly what the statute
in the case at bar is not. The court then taking the view, upon
which there cannot be two opinions, that the act intended to
establish a universal system of trade-mark legislation applicable to all commerce, held the statute void, saying, p. 98:
"It is not within the judicial province to give to the words
used by Congress a narrower meaning than that they are
manifestly intended to bear, in order that crimes may be
punished which are not described in language within the constitutional power of that body." The reasoning relied upon
in this case to overthrow the statute, if applied to the statute
before us, tends to support it.
I do not wish to be understood as saying that the group of
cases I am now discussing does not furnish instances where
the. court has declined to limit the meaning of words in order
to save the act. I only say, that in these cases it could not
be done without violating the obvious intent of Congress as
ascertained by the necessary meaning of the language it employed; in other words, that in these cases only one interpretation was possible and there was "no room for construction." They cannot be un'-, tood as deciding that general

words may not, in view of the context -where they are found,
and, with the aid of the light of the Constitution, be restrained
in their meaning, with the purpose and effect of giving them
such a construction, that the act may be sustained as a legitimate exercise of the legislative power. If they should be so
understood they would be in flat conflict with the McCullough
case, and with the spirit of the interpretation that prevailed
in United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, and Church of the
Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457. In the former
case it was held that an act which punished certain offenses
committed by "any person or persons" upon the high seas.
should not be construed as including persons who might commit such offenses on board a vessel belonging to the subjects
of a foreign state; Marshall, C. J., saying, p. 631: "The words
of the section are in terms of unlimited extent. The words 'any
person or persons' are broad enough to comprehend every
htiman being. But general words must not only be limited
to cases within the jurisdiction of the State, but also to those
objects. to which the legislature intended to apply tbem."
In the latter case It was held that an act that forbade all persons from .assisting the migration into the United States of
"any alien or aliens, any foreigner or foreigners," under contract "to perform labor or ervices of any kind," did not inelude a minister of religion, though such a person was within
the letter of the statute. These cases qhow that we may with
propriety give to the words "any of its emilRyds" the narrower meaning, and, because such meaning saves the act from
condemnination, it is, -I believe, our imperative duly to adopt it.
No words need to be read into the act. It is required only that
the Words alfead there shall be applied to that commerce
-which Congress referred to, namely, territorial, foreign and
interstate. Thus read, the whole statute is saved and no part
of it is destroyed.
The natural meaning of the words of the statute consittered
together, each wofd receiving significance from those with
ivhich it is allied, the respect which is due to Congress, the

belief which I hold that it would not intentionally overstep
the clearly defined limits of its authority, and the principles
of construction heretofore acted upon by this court, lead my
mind to the settled conviction that the statute can be interpreted, and ought to be interpreted, as affording the remedy
therein prescribed only to the employ6s of foreign, interstate
and territorial carriers, who are themselves engaged in some
capacity in such commerce in some of its manifold aspects.
If this meaning be attributed to the words of the law, it is
apparent that in the opinion of a majority of the court the
law, in its main features at least, would be constitutional.
Entertaining these views of the meaning of the statute, I
am compelled to go further and consider the other objections
to it. I agree entirely with all that was said in the opinion
of Mr. Justice White in support of the power of the Congress
to enact a law of this general character, but, as I think that
the judgments in these cases ought to be reversed, I cannot
escape dealing with specific objections to the statute which
he has not deemed it necessary to discuss. I think it better,
therefore, to deal with all the questions that are necessarily
raised in these cases.
I come now to the question whether the statute, thus construed, is in the execution of any power conferred by the
Constitution upon the Congress. It is apparent that there is
no such power unless it be found in that clause of the Constitution which authorizes Congress "to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and among the several States and with
the Indian tribes." It hardly needs to be said that the inability of the National Government, created by the Articles
of Confederation, to deal effectively with commerce was one
of the efficient causes of the call for the constitutional convention. No doubt the most urgent need of that time was a
central government with powers adequate to control foreign
commerce, but interstate commerce. was not overlooked,
though its principal importance then consisted in its relation
to foreign commerce. [Federalist, No. 42, by Mr. Madison.]

No one could then have foreseen the extent of the interstate
commerce of our times, for no one could forefell the employment of the forces of steam and electricity which have so
wonderfully aided its development. But the statesmen of that
time, confident of the future and hopeful that they might
devise a government which would endure, must have under-.
stood that the commerce which concerned more than 'one
State, from its essential nature, was in part outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State, could not be governed efficiently
by a single State, and, if left outside of the National control,
would be subject to woeful embarrassment by the conflicting
regulations of the several States into Which, it entered: It
appears in the reports of the debates that these dangers. were
appreciated by the members of the convention, so far as they
threatened that part of the commerce among, the States which
was conducted by water transportation, then the only part of
such commerce of sufficient importance to Attract public attention. But fortunately the spirit of the nation builder and
not of the codemaker inspired and dominated the convention.
Its members were not content to frame a system of laws sufficient for the present moment, which might in a few years become unsuited to or inadequate for the needs of the people.
They undertook rather the, task of devising a scheme of government and of allotting the powers usually exercised by*
governments between the existing States and the prospective
Nation. Whenever such a power came under'bonsideration its
nature -was examined, and it was then placed in the hands of
that governmental agency which it was supposed could exercise it' most advantageously. This very power furnishes a
signal illustration of the method pursued. The convention did
not determine how interstate commerce should be regulated
but rather who should regulate it, and left, 'with certain limitations, the necessity, extent and nature of the regulation to the
contemporaneous knowledge, wisdom and discretion of the
body.in whom the power was vested. We may well believe
that, contemplating the. subject vith the enlarged vision of

those who are building for a future unknown or dimly discerned, and seeing clearly that interstate like foreign commerce was, in the words of the resolutions with which Randolph opened the deliberations of 'the convention, a matter
"to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which
the harmony of the United States may. be ii. terrupted by the
exercise of individual legislation," the convention was constrained to associate the two together in every draft of the
Constitution proposed, and place them with the Indian trade,
under the control of the National legislature. Madison's
Journal, Scott's edition, pp. 67, 161, 164, 185, 362, 453, 654,
656, 704, 753.
The different kinds 6f commerce described have the common qualities that they are more extensive than the jurisdiction of a single State and liable toinjury from conflicting state
laws, and thereby are all alike distinguished from the purely
internal commerce -ofI the States. There is nothing in the
words of the grant that permits the belief that the power is
not coextensive over foreign, interstate, and Indian trade, or
is anything less than the whole power which any government
may properly exercise over either, though it may well be that
the restrictive parts of the Constitution, its prohibitions and
reservations, may operate differently on different kinds of
commerce, or even on different aspects of the same kind of
commerce.
/ It is said that Congress has never-before enacted legislation
of zhis nature for the. government of interstate commerce on
land, though it has for the government of such commerce upon
the water and for the government of foreign commerce; that
on the contrary the relations affected have been controlled
by the undoubted power of the States to govern men and
tliings within their respective dominions; and that this :mis.siop- of Congress is of controlling significance. The fundatyental fallacy of this argument is that it nmisunderstands the

forgets that its unchanging provisions are adaptable to the

infinite variety of the changing conditions of our National life.
Surely there is no statute of limitations which bars Congress
from the exercise of any of its granted powers, nor any authority, save that of the people whom it represents, which
may with propriety challenge the wisdom of its choice of the
'time when remedies shall first be applied to what it deems
wrong. It cannot be doubted that the exercise of a power for
the first time may be called upon to juistify itself. The fact
that it is for the first time is a circumstance to be considered.
But in this case it is a circumstance whose significance disappears in the light of history. Henry Adams, a writer of high
authority, in the first chapter of his History of the United
States, has drawn a yivid picture of the conditions of our
National life at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
center of population was near Baltimore. The interior was
almost impenetrable except by the waterways and two wagon
roads from Philadelphia to Pittsburg and from the Potomac
to the Monongahela. The scattered settlements of what was
then the Western country were severed from the seaboard
settlements by mountain ranges, and there was little connection between the two almost independent peoples. There was
scarcely a possibility of trade between the State* except along
the seacoast and over the dangerous and uncertain rivers.
"The experience of mankind," says the author, p. 7, "proved
trade to be dependent on water communications, and as yet
Americans did not dream that the experience of mankind was
useless to them." We need not look beyond these conditions
for an explanation why Congress, though it early and vigorously
exeroised its power of legislation over foreign commerce and
interstate commerce by water, left it unused in respect to
interstate commerce on the land. As population multiplied,
bringing the isolated settlements nearer to each other, wealth
increased, creating a wider demand for commodities, and roads
and bridges came to be better and more numerous, doubtless
overland commerce was somewhat stimulated. But the iron
restrictions which nature had placed upon land transportation

remained constant until they were unloosed by the operation
of the steam railroad. The system of steam transportation
began modestly by the construction of short lines, often wholly
within a single State. These lines were lengthened by extensions and consolidations, until at the present time the
States of the Union are all bound together by a network of
interstate railroads. Their operation, aided by the quick and
cheap transmission of the mails, and the communication of
intelligence by electricity, has transformed the commerce of
the country. Interstate commerce by land, once so slight as
to be unworthy of the attention of the National legislature,
has come to be the most important part of all trade, and it is
not too much to say that the daily needs of the factory and
•the household are no longer dependent upon the resources
of the locality, but are largely supplied by the products of
other States.
It was not reasonably to be expected that a phenomenon
so contrary to the experience of mankind, so vast, so rapidly
deyeloping and changing,as the growth of land commerce
.among the States, would speedily be appreciated in all its
aspects, or would at once call forth the exercise of all the
unused power vestd in Congress by the commerce clause of
the Constitution. Such a phenomenon demands study and
experience. The habit of our people, accentuated by our
system of representative government, is not so much in legislation to anticipate problems as it is to deal with them after
experience has shown them to exist. So Congress has exercised its power sparingly, step by step, and has acted only
when experience seemed to it to require action. A description
of its action in this respect was given in In re Debs, 158 U. S.
564, where it was said, p. 579: "Congress has exercised the
power granted in respect. to interstate commerce in a variety
of legislative acts. Passing by for the present all that legislation in respect to commerce by water, and considering only
that which bears upon railroad interstate transportation (for
this is the specific matter involved in this case), these acts

here be stated. They show a constantly increasing tendency
to exercise more fully and vigorously the power conferred by
the commerce clause. It is well to notice, however, that Congress has assumed the duty of promoting the safety of public
travel by enacting the Safety Appliance Law; an act to require
reports of casualties to employ6s or passengers (31 Stat. 1446);
a resolution directing the Interstate Commerce Commission
to investigate and report on the necessity for block signals
(34 Stat. 838); an act limiting the hours of service of employ~s, and the- act under consideration. These acts, all relating to interstate transportation, demonstrate the belief of
Congress that the safety of interstate travel is a matter of
National concern, and its deliberate purpose to increase that
safety by laws which it deems conducive to that end. I think,
therefore, that we may consider whether this act finds authority in the commerce clause of the Constitution without
embarrassment from any inferences which may be drawn from
the inaction of Congress.
It is settled beyond the necessity of citing cases that the
transportation of persons and property is commerce, in other
words, that the business of carriers is commerce. Where,
therefore, the business is foreign or interstate, Congress, it
has frequently been decided, has the paramount, if not the
sole, power to legislate for its direct control. An obstruction
of such commerce by unlawful violence may be made punishable under the laws of the United States, suppressed by the
armies of the United States, or, at the instance of the United
States, enjoined in its courts. In re Debs, ubi sup. It is difficult to conceive how legislation may effectively control the
business if it cannot regulate the conduct of those engaged in
the business, while engaged in the business, in every act which
is performed in the conduct of the business. The business of
transportation is not an abstraction. It is the labor of men
employed with the aid of instrumentalities, animal and mechanical, in carrying men and things from place to place. In
every form of transportation, from the simplest to the most

complex, whether the man carries the burden on his back,
or drives an animal which carries it, or a locomotive which
draws a car which carries it, the one and only constant factor
is the labor of mankind. I am quite unable to understand the
contention made at the bar that the power of Congress is to
regulate commerce among the States and not to regulate persons engaged in commerce among the States, for in the case
of transportation at least the labor of those engaged in it is
commerce itself. How poor and meagre the power would be
if,, whenever it was exercised, the legislator must pause to consider whether the action proposed regulated commerce or
merely regulated the conduct of persons engaged in commerce. The contention derives some plausibility from its
vagueness. Of course the power to regulate commerce does
not authorize Congress to control the general conduct of persons engaged therein, but, unless it is an idle and useless power,
it authorizes Congress to control the conduct of persons engaged in commerce in respect to everything which directly
concerns commerce, for that is commerce itself. It would
seem, therefore, that when persons are employed in interstate
or foreign commerce, as the employment is an essential part
of that commerce, its terms and conditions, and the rights
and duties which grow out of it, are under the control of
Congress subject only to the limits on the exercise of that
control prescribed in the Constitution. This has been the
view always expressed or implied by this court. In his concurring opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, Mr. Justice Johnson said, p. 229: "Commerce, in its simplest significatiaa, means an exchange of goods; but in the advancement
of society, labor, transportation, intelligence, care and various
mediums of exchange become commodities and enter into
commerce; the subject, the vehicle, the agent, and their
various operations, become the objects of commercial regulations." In Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, the
court in holding, inter alia,that a regulation of pilots is a regulation of commerce ithin the meaning of the commerce clause

207 U. S.

MooDy, J., dissenting.

said (p. 316, by J ustice Curtis) of the power: "It extends to
the persons who condut it, as well as to the instruments used."
In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Field, in
Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, it was said, p. 103: "It is true
that the commercial power confeirred by the Constitution is
one without limitation. It authorizes legislation with respect
to all the subjects of foreign and interstate commerce, the
persons engaged in it and the instruments by which it is
carried on." In delivering the opinion of the court in Smith
v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, where a state statute requiring
interstate locomotive engineers to obtain a license after a
qualifying examination, and imposing a penalty for operating
without such license, was sustained, Mr. Justice Matthews
said, p. 479: "It would, indeed, be competent for Congress to
legislate upon its subject matter and to prescribe the qualifications of locomotive engineers for employment by carriers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce." In sustaining a
similar state statute, directed against color blindness, Mr. Jusuice Field said in Nashville &c. Railway v. Alabama, 128 U. S.
96, 99: "It is conceded that the power of Congress to regulate
interstate commerce is plenary; that, as incident to it, Congress may legislate as to the qualifications, duties, and liabilities of employs and others on .railway trains engaged in
that commerce; and that such legislation will supersede any
-*;ate action on the subject. But until such legislation is had,
it is clearly within the competency of the State to provide
against accidents on the train." In Chicago &c. Railway v.
..'olan, 169 U. S. 133, a state statute forbidding a contract
limiting liability for injury was sustained, the court, by Mr.
Justice Gray, saying, p. 137: "The rules prescribed for the
construction of railroads, and for their management and opera-'
tion, designed to protect persons and property, otherwise
endangered by their use, are strictly within the scope of the
local law. They are not, in themselves, regulations of interstate commerce, though they control, in some degree, the
conduct and liability of those engaged in such commerce.

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.

So long as Congress has not legislated upon the particular
subject, they are rather to be regarded as legislation in aid
of such commerce, and as a rightful exereise of the police
power of the State to regulate the relative rights and duties
of all persons and corporations within its limits." This statement was assumed to be true in Pennsylvania Railroad v.
Hughes, 191 U. S.477, and Martin v. Pittsburg &c. Railroad,
203 U. S.284. The case of Peirce v. Van Dusen, 78 Fed. Rep.
693, was decided by the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit
by Mr. Justice Harlan and Judges Taft and Lurton. The opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan. After sustaining a
state statute, which modified the common law rules with respect
to the liability for injuries of a carrier to its employ~s, he said
of it: "The Ohio statute is not applicable alone to railroad
corporations of Ohio, engaged in the domestic commerce of
this State. It is equallk, applicable to railroad corporations
doing business in Ohio, and engaged ia commerce among the
States, although the statute, in its operation, may affect in
some degree a subject over which Congress can exert full
power. The States may do many things affecting commerce
with foreign nations and among the several States until
Congress covers the subject by National legislation.
Undoubtedly the whole subject of the liability of interstate
railroad companies for the negligence of those in their service
may be covered by National legislation enacted by Congress
under its power to regulate commerce among the States."
We may not trust implicitly to the accuracy of statements
gathered from opinions where the precise question was not
for dccision. But where, as in these q,otations, the statements
were an essential part of the course of reasoning deemed appropriate for the disposition of the cases, where the same
thought clothed in different words has been expressed at
intervals from early times to the present day, and where no
decision or judicial utterance has been found in opposition
to them, they are enfitled to profound respect, and furnish
cogent evidence of what the law has always been supposed to

be by the members of this court. They cannot be regarded
lightly, and if we follow them they lead us to the conclusion
that the national power to regulate commerce is broad enough
to regulate the employments, duties, obligations, liabilities and
conduct of all persons engaged in commerce with respect to
all which is comprehended in that commerce. Upon what
principle except this could this court have twice enforced
the Safety Appliance Act, undisturbed by a doubt of its constitutionality? Johnson v. Railroad, 196 U. S. 1; Schlemmer
v. Railroad, 205 U. S. 1. That act (27 Stat. 531) compelled
interstate railroads to equip all their trains with power brakes
operated from the engine, and all their cars with automatic
couplers, grab-irons, and hand holds, by enacting that the
use of engines and cars not thus equipped should be unlawful.
There was no express provision that an employ6 ifijured by
the failure of a railroad to comply with the law should be entitled to damages, but without doubt the liability of the railroad is implied. The common law rule' governing the liability
was materially changed by § 8, which abolished, in part the
doctrine of the assumption of risk, by providing that the
employ6 should "not be deemed to have assrimed the risk"
of the unlawful conditions, though he knew of them and continued 'in his employment. This section was enforced in most
emphatic manner in the Schlemmer case, where Mr. Justice
Holmes said, 205 U. S.11: "An early, if not the earliest, application of the phrase 'assumption of risk' was the establishment of the ex ception to the liability of a master for the
negligence of his servant when the person injured was a fellowservant of the injured man." If the statute now before us is
beyond the constitutional power of Congress, surely the Safety
Appliance Act is also void, for there can be no distinction in
principle between them. If Congress can create a liability to
an injured employ6 for the existence of conditions in certain
mechanisms which he uses, by declaring those conditions unlawful, it may create the same liability for negligence of the
agents and imperfections in the instruments used in the car.

rier's work; if it may change the common law rule of the assumption of the risk of imperfect appliances, it may change
the rule of the assumption of tile risk of a careless fellow
servant. I can conceive of no principle of constitutional law
which enables us to say that the commerce clause authorizes
Congress to fix upon the carrier a liability for an insufficient
brake but not for a defective rail, for tho. absence of automatic
couplers, but not for the negligent order which brings trains
into collision, for an insecure grab-iron, but not for a heedless
switchman. If Congress has the right to control the liability
in, any way it may control it in every way, subject, as all
powers are subject, to the express prohibitions of the Constitution. Unless the cases on the safety appliance acts are
deemed to have been inadvertently decided, they seem to be
conclusive of this branch of the case. This seems to have been
feared by counsel for one of the defendants, who in his brief
said "that the giving of a right of recovery to an injured employ6 is a proper and necessary method for making effective

we do not admit."

But if we put aside the authority of precedents, and examine
the nature and extent of the grant to Congress of power over
commerce in the light of the settled principles of interpretation fit to be applied to the exposition of a constitution, w-e
shall arrive at the same result. One main purpose and effect,
of the Constitution was to devise a, scheme of efficient governiment. In order to accomplish this all the powers usually
exercised by governments were distributed between the States
and the Nation, except those deemed unfit or unsafe to be
entrusted to either and withheld from both. In the allotment
of powers to the Nation they were ernumerated rather than
defined. In the enumeration words of the largest import were
employed, comprehending within their meaning grand divisions of the powers of government. The nature 'of the
Constitution, said Chief Justice Marshall (McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, p. 407), "requires that only its great outlines should he marked, its important objects designated, and

the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves." The wide
extent of the powers granted to Congress -is
expressed in a few
simply worded provisions, all of which might be printed on a
single page of its book of annual laws. Counsel have argued
that the power to regulate commerce does not include the
power to regulate the conduct of persons engaged in that
commerce in respect of that commerce. This is what Mr.
Justice Miller (110 U. S.658) described as "the old argument
often heard, often repeated, and in this court never assented
to, that when a question of the power of Congress arises the
advocate of the power must be able to place his finger on
words which expressly grant it." Suppose that method of
reasoning had been applied to the power "to establish post
offices and post roads," under which Congress goverris the
postal system of the country as fully and freely in every detail
as it is governed by any other nation. It could be said to
Congress, you cannot carry the mail, you cannot issue money
orders, you cannot determine what shall be excluded from the
mail, you cannot regulate the conduct of those who are employed in the mail service, you cannot exempt them from
militia duty, you cannot punish their theft or embezzlement,
.you cannot punish him who breaks and enters the post office
or mail car-all these powers are reserved to the States. You
can only establish post offices and post roads, and when that
is done your power is exhausted. Yet Congress has done all
these things and no one now doubts its power to do them,
because the grant of power is of the whole governmental power
over the subject. So, too, the power to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce is the whole power which any government can exercise over that subject, it "is vested in Congress
as absolutely as it would be in a single government having in
its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of the
power as are found in the Constitution of the United States."

inquiry whether a power so extensive is a sufficient warrant for the enactment of the statute before us.
By what has been called the, auxiliary power- Congress may
"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution" its granted powers. It is settled that this
provision authorizes the enactment of laws which, in the exercise of a wide'discretion, Congress deems adapted to secure a
legitimate end and calculated to effect any of the objects entrusted to it, and the exercise of that discretion, unless it violates some prohibition of the Constitution or is used as a pretext to accomplish some object not entrusted to the National
Government, cannot be reviewed by the judicial branch of the
Government without trespassing upon a domain which is peculiarly and exclusively the province of the legislative branch.
If the statute under consideration be -brought to the test of
these prinqiples there can be no doubt of its validity.
It cannot be denied that in that part of commerce which consists in transportation, the safety of those who are concerned
in it as passengers or employ6s is of the first importance. As
was said by Mr. Justice Gray, in Chicago &c. Railway Co. v.
Solan, 169 U. S. 133, 135, "the fundamental principle on which
the law of common carriers was established was the securing of
the utmost care and diligence in the performance of their public duties." The Government having the relations which the
National Government has to interstate commerce, pronounced
by the court in the Debs Case, 158 U. S. 564, 578, to be "those
of direct supervision, control, and management," which neglects to do what it is fitting for a government to do to insure
the safety of public travel, fails in the performance of its highest
duty. The lengthening list of casualties to employ6s and passengers on our railroads has arrested the public attention and
created public alarm. Ought Congress alone to be indifferent?
Or have we so weak a system of government that the only part
of it which is clothed with direct authority over the commerce
in which the casualties happen is powerless? What does the
"direct supervision, control, and management" amount to if

it does not include the power to pass any laws really calculated
to lessen the great dangers of public travel? Congress, recognizing its responsibility and believing in its power, has enacted
the group of laws to which reference has been made. Of one
(the Safety Appliance Act) the Chief Justice said, in the Johnson Case, 196 U. S. 17, what is true of all: "The primary object
of the act was to promote the public welfare by securing the
safety of employ6s and travellers." That act, like this, in terms
simply safeguarded the employd, but his safety cannot be
separated from the safety of the traveller; both may be affected
by the same act of negligence and the same defect in appliances,
and suffer injury in the same disaster. Any law which promotes
the safety of either promotes the safety of both. Much of the
law of common carriers, whether created by decisions of the
courts or by acts of legislatures, has been upon or influenced by
the theory that the nature of the liabilities imposed upon the
carriers directly affects the care, diligence and safety with which
they conduct their business. For instance, one consideration
which has influenced the courts in the judicial development of the
fellow-servant doctrine is, that, by imposing upon the employ6
the risk of the carelessness of the men with whom he works, a
greater degree of care and therefore of safety would result.
The truth of this theory has been often disputed (see Chicago
&c. Railroad v. Ross, 112 U. S. 377), and it is almost universally disregarded in modern legislation. It is of no importance
here whether it is right or wrong. The only significance is
that the greater or less liability in damages is generally regarded
as having some relation to the safety of operation. It follows
that if Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power over interstate and foreign transportation, deems that the safety of that
transportation would be increased by enacting that those employed in it shall have a different remedy for injuries sustained
by its negligent conduct than that furnished by the laws of the
States, this court cannot, without eiverstepping the boundary
which separates the judicial from the legislative field, declare
the enactment void.

The power of Congress to enact the law under consideration,
which seems so.clearly to result from a just interpretation of the
commerce clause, might not have been disputed. but for the
fact that up to this time the subject has been left to be dealt
with by the States. If a doubt ever existed that the States
could lawfully deal with the subject under the general legislative authority to govern their territory, which was undisturbed by the Constitution, that doubt was dispelled by the
decision in Sherlock v. Alling, ubi sup., 93 U. S. 99, and it isnow agreed that the State may, in the absence of action by
Congress, fix and determine the liability of all carriers while
operating within the State, to those whom they employ for
the injuries which are suffered in the course of the employment.
But such authority in the State is not inconsistent with a like
authority in the Nation. Where, as in the case of our dual government, the same territories and the same individuals are subject to two governments, each supreme within its sphere, both
governments by virtue of distinct powers may legislate for the
same ends. The exercise of the rightful authority of the Nation and the State, though it proceeds from different governmental powers, may reach and control the same subject. This
result arises from the different relations to the community the
subject may sustain; a drove of cattle may be at once interstate freight and the vehicle by which infectious disease may
be brought within the borders of a State; a bridge may at the
same time interrupt the navigation of the river and serve as a
continuation of the highways of the. State; a man, while the
agent- through which the transaction of interstate commerce
is conducted, is at the same time one of. the population, permanent or transient, of a State and subject to its general laws.
There is no conflict in powers, though- there may be conflict in
legislation, referable to different powers. In such a case under
our system the law of the State enacted by virtue of its undoubted powers must yield to the national law enacted in pursuance of the powers conferred by the Constitution. There is
no necessity in this case to disturb the troublesome question

when, if ever, even where Congress is silent, the States may
exercise any direct power over interstate and foreign commerce.
For the power hitherto exercised by the States over this particular subject has never been deemed to be a regulation of
commerce, but rather an exercise of their authority to regulate
generally the relations of men to each other, which may indlirectly affect such commerce. "if a State," said Chief Justice Marshall (in Gibbons v. Ogden, ubi sup., 204), "in passing
laws on subjects acknowledged to be within its control, and,
with a view to those subjects, shall adopt a measure of the same
character with one which Congress may adopt, it (toes not derive its authority from the particular power which has been
granted, but from some other, which remains with the State
and may be executed by the same means. All experience shows
that the same measure or measures, scarcely distinguishable.
from each other, may flow from distinct powers; but this does
not prove that the powers themselves are identical." That the
States may by their laws fix the relative rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of all persons or corporations within their
territorial jurisdictions, and thus control in that respect those
who are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce; that such
laws do not proceed from any power to regulate such commerce,
though incidentally and indirectly they (1o regulate it, but are
to be referred to their general power over persons and things
within their territories, and that all such laws, -so far as they
affect such commerce, must yield to the superior authority of
the laws of Congress, is, I think, conclusively shown by the following cases: Sherlock v. Ailing, 93 U. S. 99; Smith v. Alabama,
124 U. S.465; Nashville &c. Railway Co2.v. Alabama, 128 U. S.
96; Hennington v. Georgia, 163 U. S.299; New York &c. Railroad v. New York, 165 U. S.628; Chicago &c. Railroad Co. v.

477; Martin v. Pittsburg &c. Railroad, 203 U. S.284; Peirce v.
Van Dusen, 78 Fel. Rep. 693. Upon principle and authority it,
in my opinion, is clear that Congress had constitutional power
over the subject with which it dealt in the statute before us.

There remains to be c6hsidered the objection that the specific provisions of the act exceed the legislative power over the
subject. The powers of Congress are not only confined to those
which may be inferred from the Constitution, but are also restrained by the express limits upon their exercise which are
contained in that instrument. They are delegated and enumerated and then limited. Even when Congress enters upon a
field in which it rightfully exercises the supreme governmental
power, it is not supreme in the fullest sense. It does not enjoy
complete sovereignty like that, for instance, of the British
Parliament. All its legislation must obey the express commands
of those parts of the Constitution which mark a limit beyond
which legislation cannot go. The only limit upon the authority of Congress relevant to the discussion of this branch of the
case is that which forbids Congress from depriving any person
of his life, liberty or property, without due process of law.
Amendment VI. It is contended that, although the law deals
with a subject under the control of Congress, it deals with it
in such a manner as to violate that prohibition, and is therefore void. Before considering the contention it is desirable
to state clearly the substantial provisions of the act. The
remedy afforded by it is more generous to the employ6 than
that given by the common law in several respects. The common law recognized no recovery of damages for death resulting
from negligence; by the statute damages are recoverable for
death as well as for injury. The common law allowed no recovery against the employer for the neglect of a fellow-servant
engaged in a common employment; by the statute the employer is held responsible for the hegligence of any of its officers,
agents or employ~s, even though the guilty person is a fellowservant of him who is injured or killed. The common law deni6d to one who by his negligence had contributed to his own
injury the right to a remedy for the neglect of another which
had been a concurring cause; by the statute the negligent
sufferer may recover if his negligence be slight, and that of
the emlloyer gross in comparison, though the contributing

negligence must be taken into account in reduction of the
damages. The commoM.law, as adjudged by this court, permitted the employ6 to enter into a contract renouncing his
right to damages in case he incurred injuries in the course of
his employment; the statute forbids such a contract. Thus
four doctrines of the common law restrictive of the employ~s'
rights are supplanted by others more favorable to him.
There can be no doubt of the right of a legislative body,
having jurisdiction over the subject, to modify the first three
of these rules of the common law in the manner in which this
act of Congress does it. They are simply rules of law, unprotected by the Constitution from change, and like all other
such rules must yield to the superior authority of a statute.
.They have so generally been modified by statute that it may
well be doubted if they exist in their integrity in any jurisdiction. The common law rules have taken forin thrQugh the decisions of courts, whose judges in announcing them were controlled by their views of what justice and sound public policy
demanded. This is nowhere more clearly stated than by Chief
Justice Shaw in Farwell v. Boston & Worcester Railroad, 4
Met. 49, the leading American case establishing the doctrine
that one cannot recover against the master for the negligence
of a fellow-servant, where he said" "In considering the rights
and obligations arising out of particular relations, it is competent for c6urts of justice to regard considerations of policy and
general convenience, and to draw from them such rules as will,
in their practical application, best promote the safety and security of all parties concerned." But the economic opinions
of judges and their views of the' requirements of justice and
public policy, even 'when' crystallized into 'well-settled doctrines of law, have no corfstitutional sanctity. They are binding upon succeeding judges, but while they may influence they
cannot control legislators. Legislators have their own economic
theories, their own views of justice and public policy, and their
views when embodied in a written law must prevail. Whenever the legislative power to change any of these rules of the

common law has been drawn in question in this court it has
been sustained. Various state statutes ' allowing a remedy
against a railroad employer for the negligence of a fellowservant have been held to be within the legislative power.
Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Mackey, 127 U. S. 205;
Minneapolis &c. Railway Company v. Herrick, 127 U. S. 210;
Chicago, Kansas & Western Railroad Company v. Pontius, 157
U. S.209; Tullis v. Lake Erie & Western Railroad, 175 U. S.
348. State statutes, allowing a recovery for death, were sustained in Steamboat Company v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, and Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S.99, though the statute was attacked in
the first case only on the ground that it intruded upon the admiralty jurisdiction exclusively vested in the courts of the
United States, and in the second case because it interfered with
interstate commerce, whose regulation was vested exclusively
in Congress. Statutes of this kind have been -in force in the
States and doubtless in the Territories for many years, many
cases have been tried under them, and in no case has it ever
been claimed that anything in the Constitution removes them
from the legislative power. The same observation may be
made, though not so emphatically of statutes modifying. the
common law rule denying a recQvery to one contributing to
the injury by his own neglect. It is interesting to note that
this court, acting upon the same reasons which doubtless influenced Congress in the enactment of this part of the statute,
established a rule in principle the same, to govern the recovery
in admiralty of damages by a person injured on a ship (The
Max Morris, 1,37 U. S. 1, 14), holding that it promoted "the
more equal distribution of justice, the dictates of humanity, the
safety of life and limb and the public good." It is enough to
say here that the decisions of the court in the safety appliance
cases, supporting a statute changing the. analogous common law
doctrine of assumption of risk, are in principle conclusive that
the whole subject of contributory negligence is under the control of the legislativepower, in this respect unrestrained by any
constitutional provision. But it is earnestly urged upon us

MOODY,

that the statute under consideration, applying to all interstate
common carriers and all their employ6s in that business, without distinguishing between that part of the business and employment which is dangerous and hazardous and that part
which is not, and confined solely to the business of common
carriage and its employers, is a deprivation of the employer's
property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth
Amendment of the Constitution. The manner in which due
process of law is said to be denied is by the denial of the equal
protection of the laws by imposing unusual burdens upon a
class of persons arbitrarily and capriciously selected. In support of this position cases from state courts interpreting state
constitutions and cases from this court interpreting the restriction upon state action imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment, are indiscriminately cited. They furnish little aid.
It is not necessary in this case to determine how far, if at
all, the requirement from the States of the equal protection
of the laws made by the Fourteenth Amendment is included in
the requirement from- the Nation of due process of law made
by the Fifth Amendment .to the Constitution. It is enough to
say that this statute complies with both. It is rather startling
to hear that in enacting laws applicable to common carriers
alone Congresg has made a capricious. and arbitrary classification. From time immemorial the common law has set apart
those engaged in that business as a peculiar class, to be governed in many respects by laws peculiar to themselves. In
separating carriers from those engaged in other interstate and
foreign commerce, Congress has but followed the ancient classification of the common law, based upon reasons so obvious that
they need no statement. Whether the law should be made to
apply to all carriers or to carriers by railroad alone, or whether
the employds should be classified according to -the degree of
danger which surrounds their employment, is a matter of legislative discretion With which we have no right to meddle.

three changes in the common law made by the statute. The
fourth change, that forbidding the employ6 to make a contract
releasing his employer from the consequences of his negligence,
is open to a possible objection not common to the others. It is
asserted that this part of the act violates the right of free contract which in some cases this court has protected against the
exercise of the legislative power. Without intimating any
opinion on that subject, it is enough to say that that part of the
statute is separable from and independent of the remainder,
and may stand or fall by itself, and that no question concerning
it is raised in these cases. I see nothing in the provision that
"all questions of negligence or contributory negligence shall be
for the jury,. which affects the right of jury trial guaranteed
by the Seventh Amendment. Such questions always have
been for the jury, and I cannot see that this enactment makes
any change whatever.
I am of opinion, therefore, that the act should be sustained
as a legitimate exercise of the authority of Congress, and that
orders in these cases should be made accordingly.

Mr. Justice McKenna and myself are of opinion that it was
within the power of Congress to prescribe, as between an interstate commerce carrier and its employ6s, the rule of liability
established by the act of June 11, 1906. But we do not concur
inthe interpretation of that act as given in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justi'ce White, but think that the act, reasonably
and properly interpreted, applies, and should be interpreted
as intended by Congress to apply, only to cases of interstate
commerce and to employ6s who, at the time of the particular
wrong or injury complained of, are engaged in such commerce,
and not to domestic commerce or commerce completely internal to the State inwhich the wrong or injury occurred. We
concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Moody as to the

scope and interpretation of the act. We think the act is constitutional, and, therefore, that the judgment should be reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES,

dissenting.

I must admit that I think there are strong reasons in favor
of the interpretation of the statute adopted by a majority of
the court. But, as it is possible to read the words in such a
way as to save the constitutionality of the act, I think they
should be taken in that narrower sense. The phrase "every
common carrier engaged in trade or commerce" may be construed to mean "while engaged in trade or commerce" without
violence to the habits of English speech, and to govern all that
follows. The statute then will regulate all common carriers
while so engaged in the District of Columbia or in any Territory,
thus covering the whole ground as to them; and it will regulate
carriers elsewhere while engaged in commerce between the
States, etc., thus limiting its scope where it is necessary to limit
it. So construed I think the act valid in its main features under the Constitution of the United States. In view of the circumstances I do notdiscuss details.
