MACLAUGHLIN, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. ALLIANCE INSURANCE CO.*
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 548.

Argued April 13, 14, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

1. While increase in value of property, not realized as gain by its
sale or other disposition, may, in an economic or bookkeeping sense,
be deemed an addition to capital in a later period, it is nevertheless a gain from capital investment which, when realized by conversion into money or other property, constitutes income within
the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, taxable as such in the
period when realized. P. 249.
2. The tax being upon realized gain, it may constitutionally be imposed upon the entire amount of the gain realized within the taxable period, even though some of it represents enhanced value
in an earlier period before the adoption of the taxing act. P. 250.
3. Gains realized by stock fire insurance companies from sale or
other disposition of property, accruing after March 1, 1913, were
taxable as income under the revenue acts of 1913-1918, but not
under those of 1921-1926. The Act of 1928 taxed their income
and by § 204 (b) defined their gross income as including "gain
during the taxable year from sale or other disposition of property."
Held, that the tax under the 1928 Act is on the entire gain realized
within the taxable year, to be determined, pursuant to §§ 111-113,
by deducting from the net selling price the cost of the property sold,
or the fair market value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that
date. P. 251.
QUESTIONS certified in two cases pending in the court
below upon appeals from judgments of the District Court
in two suits to recover alleged overpayments of income
taxes from the Collector. In both cases the District
Court construed § 204 of the Revenue Act of 1928 as
measuring taxable gains from the sale or other disposition of property on its fair market value as of January 1,
1928. In No. 547, it sustained the tax, computed on this

basis, and in No. 548 it held the tax invalid because computed on the basis of value on March 1, 1913, or other
basis as provided by § 113 of the Act, and not on the
basis of value as of January 1, 1928. See 49 F. (2d) 361.
Mr. Robert T. McCracken, with whom Messrs. Edward
M. Biddle and Robert C. Walker were on the brief, for
the insurance companies.
The meaning of "income" in income tax acts is definitely settled. Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.
S. 170; Merchants Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, 255
U. S. 509.
Any increased value that accrued before January 1,
1928, the effective date of the new clause in question, is
capital and not income. Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co.,
247 U. S. 179; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S.
359; Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189;
United States v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co.,
247 U. S. 195; Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221; Southern
Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330.
Until January 1, 1921, gain which had accrued subsequently to March 1, 1913, and had been realized in the
taxable year by insurance companies was subject to income tax as in the case of all other corporations. Such
gain, however, was omitted from the definition of gross
income of life insurance companies and of insurance companies other than life or mutual in the taxing Acts from
January 1, 1921, until January 1, 1928, the effective date
of the Revenue Act of 1928. A change was then effected
in respect to insurance companies other than life or mutual by an amendment to § 204 which provided that gross
income should include "gain during the taxable year
from the sale or other disposition of property." This
amendment was in order that such insurance companies
might be "put on the same basis" in this respect with
mutual companies.

Argument for the Collector.

286 U.S.

Section 204 is complete, in so far as the matters are
concerned which it purports to cover, except where there
are express cross-references. There is no such cross-reference in §204 (b) (1) (b). The Supplement is also silent
as to how such gain shall be computed.
There is entirely absent from the Act of 1928 and from
the legislative history any evidence of an intent to penalize this type of insurance company by subjecting it
to an income tax upon gain realized from the sale or
other disposition of property during the taxable year,
which had accrued five or ten years, or even longer, before
the effective date of the Act. Even if such an intent had
been clearly and unequivocally expressed, it would have
exceeded the power of Congress. It would have been a
tax on capital under the guise of an income tax and
would have been arbitrary and capricious.
The proper interpretation of § 204 (b) (1)(b) is that
the basis for determining gain from the sale or other
disposition of property acquired before January 1, 1928,
is the value of such property as of December 31, 1927.
Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, and Messrs. Sewall Key, J.
Louis Monarch, and Win. H. Riley, Jr., were on the brief,
for MacLaughlin, Collector.
The statute contemplates that the basis provided in
§ 113 shall be applicable to gains from sales of property
by stock fire insurance companies. Section 111 provides
that that basis shall apply "except as hereinafter provided in this section." There is no provision in the section excepting such insurance companies from its application. Although § 204 does not expressly refer to § 111
or § 113, it is clear from §4 in the introductory provisions,
as well as from the structure of the Act as a whole, that
general provisions like those of §§ 111 and 113 are to ap-

Opinion of the Court.

ply to all taxpayers taxed on gains on sales of property
unless some other speeific provisionforbids.
The legislative history of § 204 shows that Congress intended that in respeet of gains, stock fire insurance companies should be treated in the same manner as mutual
fire insurance companies.
The Commissioner's action accords with the construction of the Act which has been consistently adopted by
the Treasury Department in formal regulations and other
rulings.
The fact that some of the increase in value occurred
during the period when no tax was levied on such gains
is immaterial. The exemption enjoyed by stock fire insurance companies under the Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926
did not deprive Congress of the power in 1928 to tax this
class of taxpayers on such gains upon the same basis as
other corporations. Cf. Cooper v. United States, 280 U. S.
409; Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470.
MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellee in No. 548, a Pennsylvania stock fire and
marine insurance corporation, brought the present suit
in the District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania, to recover
income tax for the year 1928, alleged to have been illegally
exacted. Under the Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917
and 1918, stock fire insurance companies were taxed upon
their. income, including gains realized from the sale or
other disposition of property, accruing subsequent to
March 1, 1913; but by the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924
and 1926, gains of such companies, from the sale or other
disposition of property, were not subject to tax, and losses
similarly incurred. were not deductible from gross income.

companies, and by § 204 (b) (1), applicable to insurance
companies other than life or mutual, gross income was
defined as including "gain during the taxable year from
the sale or other disposition of property." In 1928 appellant receiv 1 a profit from the sale of property acquired
before that year, upon which the Commissioner. assessed
a tax computed, on the basis prescribed by § 113 Qf the
Act, by including in the taxable income all the gain attributable to increase in value after March 1, 1913, and
realized in 1928. The District Court held that only the
accretion of gain after January 1, 1928, was taxed, and
gave judgment in the Company's favor for the tax collected in excess of the amount so computed. 49 F. (2d)
361. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third. Circuit certified a question to this Court under § 239 of the
Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13,
1925, as follows:
"Under the Revenue Act of 1928, is the basis to be
used by an insurance company (other than a life or mutual insurance company) in computing 'gain during the
taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property,' acquired before and disposed of after January 1,
1928, its fair market value as of January 1, 1928, the effective date of the Act?"
The Company contends that so much of the gain as
accrued before the effective date of the taxing Act was
capital, which could not constitutionally be taxed under
the Sixteenth Amendment, and that in any case the constitutionality of a tax upon the previously accrued gain
is so doubtful as to require the taxing act to be construed
as not authorizing such a levy.
In No. 547, decided by the same District Court, and involving similar facts and the same taxing statutes, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit certified the following question:

MAcLAUGHLIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO.
244

249

Opinion of the Court.

"If the basis to be used by an insurance company
(other than a life or mutual insurance company) in computing 'gain during the taxable year from the sale or
other disposition of property,' acquired before and disposed of after January 1, 1928, the effective date of the
Revenue Act of 1928, be the fair market 'Value of such
property as of March 1, 1913, or other basis provided by
section 113 of the Act, is the quoted provision (Section
204 (b) (1), clause (B)) unconstitutional because it taxes
capital?"
The tax under this and earlier revenue acts was imposed upon net income for stated accounting periods,
here the calendar year 1928, see Burnet v. Sanford &
Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359, 363, and it is only gain realized
from the sale or other disposition of property, which is
included in the taxable income. Realization of the gain
is 'the event which calls into operation the taxing act,
although part of the profit realized in one accounting
period may have been due to increase of value in an
earlier one. While increase in value of property, not
realized as gain by its sale or other disposition, may,
in an economic or bookkeeping sense, be deemed an addition to capital in a later period, see Merchants' Loan &
Trust Co. v. Smietanka, 255 U. S. 509, it is nevertheless a
gain from capital investment which, when realized, by
conversion into money or other property, constitutes
profit which has consistently been regarded as income
within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and
taxable as such in the period when realized. See Lynch V.
Hornby, 247 U. S. 339; Merchants' Loan & Trust Co.
v. Smietanka, supra; Eldorado Coal & Mining Co. v.
Mager, 255 U. S. 522; Goodrich v. Edwards, 255 U. S.
527; Walsh v. Brewster, 255 U. S. 536;'Taft v. Bowers,

v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

Here there is no question oLa tax on enhancement of
value occurring before March 1, 1913, the effective date
of the income tax act of that year, for the Collector asserts
no right to tax such increase in value. The fact that a
part of the taxed gain, represented increase in value after
that date, but before the present taxing act, is without
significance. Congress, having constitutional power to
tax the gain, and having established a policy of taxing
it, see Milliken v. United States, 283 U. S. 15, 22-23, may
choose the moment of its realization and the amount
realized, for the' incidence and the measurement of the
tax. Its failure to impose a tax upon the increase in
value in the earlier years, assuming without deciding that
it had the power, cannot preclude it from taxing the gain
in the year when realized, any more than in any other
case, where the tax imposed is upon realized, as distinguished from accrued, gain. If the gain became capital
by virtue of the increase in value in the years before 1928,
and so could not be taxed as income, the same would be
true of the enhancement of value in any one year after
the adoption of the taxing act, which was realized and
taxed in another. But the constitutionality of a tax so
applied, has been repeatedly affirmed and never questioned. The tax being upon realized gain, it may constitutionally be imposed upon the entire amount of the gain
realized within the taxable period, even though some. of
it represents enhanced value in an earlier period before
the adoption of the taxing act. Cooper v. United States,
280 U. S. 409; compare Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470.
See also Glenn v. Doyal, 285 U. S. 526, dismissing per
curiam, for want of a substantial federal question, an
appeal from a decision of the Georgia Supreme Court
(reported sub nom. Norman v. Bradley, 173 Ga. 482;
160 S. E. 413), that a state income tax on the profits realized from a sale of corporate stocks, after the passage of

Opinion of the Court.

the act, was constitutional, though the gains had accrued
prior to its enactment.
Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179, and
Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189, on
which the taxpayers rely, involved the construction, not
the constitutionality, of the Corporation Excise Tax Act
of 1909, and considerations which, in Lynch v. Turrish,
247 U. S.221, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S.
330, led to the construction of the income tax act of 1913
as not embracing gains accrued before the effective date
of that act, are not present here.
We think it clear that the Revenue Act of 1928 imposed
the tax on the entire gain realized within the taxable year.
Section 204 (b) (1) of Supplement G, which includes
gain from the sale of property in the gross income of insurance companies (other than life or mutual), states no
method of computing the gain. But the 1928 Act, like
its predecessors, preseribed in other sections, §§ 111-113,
that taxable gains from the sale of property should be
determined by deducting from the net sales price the cost
or the fair market value on March 1, 1913, if acquired
before that date. These provisions are general in their
terms, without any stated exception, and on their face
are applicable alike to all gains from the sale of property
taxed by the Act. They either control the computation
of the gain referred to in § 204 (b) (1) or the word
"gain," in that section, construed, without their aid, must
be taken in its ordinary sense as embracing the difference
between net cost and net selling price, and so upon established principles would include- in the taxable realized
gain all which had accrued since the effective date of the
income tax act of 1913, the first enactment adopted under
the Sixteenth Amendment. See Eisner v. Macomber, 252
U. S.189, 207; Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka,
supra, pp. 519, 520. For present purposes, the Revenue'

Act of 1928 must be regarded as substantially an amendment and continuation of the Act of 1913.
The taxpayers insist that the omission from § 204 (b)
(1) of any reference to §§ 111-113, in contrast to the inclusion in § 204 (c) of cross references to the general provisions of- the Act defining deductions, evidences an intention to exclude the method of computing gains prescribed by §§ 111-113, and to adopt a different method
with respect to gains taxed by Supplement G. But this
argument disregards the function of the general provisions of the Act, including §§ 111-113, as complementing
the provisions of Supplement G, and ignores the obvious
necessity of defining the deductions authorized by § 204
(c), either by cross references made in that section to the
general provisions of the Act or by other appropriate
means, which did not obtain with respect to the definition
of gains in § 204 (b) (1).'
This becomes evident upon an examination of the
structure of the 1928 Act, which differed from that of any
earlier revenue measure. "Title 1-Income Tax," with
which we are now concerned, is divided into three subtitles designated:
"Subtitle A-Introductory provisions."
" Subtitle B-General provisions."

"Subtitle C-Supplemental provisions."
'It is true that §§ 204 (c), 205, and 206, relating to allowed deductions from gross income, define the deductions by specific cross references to like deductions defined in the general provisions of other
sections, but as the listed deductions were intended to be exclusive,
and as those allowed to insurance companies differ in many respects
from those allowed to other corporations, it was an appropriate, if
not necessary precaution, in enumerating them, to describe those
which were allowed, either by repeating the appropriate language
contained in the general sections or to incorporate it by reference.
No such precaution was necessary with respect to § 204 (b). The
"gain " included in gross income by that section was adequately defined by §§ 111-113, made. applicable, by § 4 of Sub-title A, to the
provisions of Supplement G.

MAcLAUGHLIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO.
244

253

Opinion of the Court.

Section 4 of Subtitle A provides in part: "The application
of the General Provisions and of Supplements A to D, inclusive, to each of the following special classes of taxpayers, shall be subject to the exceptions and additional provisions found in the Supplement applicable to such classes,
(c) Insurance Companies,-Supplement
as follows: ....
G .... " The Act, by this section and by operation of
its structural arrangemeilt, thus provided that all of the
general provisions of Subtitle B, and all the general provisions of SupplementsA to D, including Supplement B,
in which §§ 111-113 occur, were to apply to the special
classes'of taxpayers referred to in Supplements E to K,
unless the provisions relating to a special class restrict the
operation of the general provisions or are necessarily inconsistent, with them. That such was the purpose to be
accomplished by the rearrangement of the taxing provisions in the 1928 Act sufficiently appears from its legislative history.2
Section 204 is not, as the District Court thought, "a
scheme or code of taxation complete in itself, . . . without reference to the general provisions of the act," unless
specifically referred to and included by cross reference to
such general provisions. An inspection of the Act discl6ses that Supplement G,- dealing with insurance, companies as a special class of taxpayers, would be unwork-.

able without resort to the general provisions of the Act
not specifically referred to in the Supplement.'
It would be going very far in the circumstances to say
that the mere omission from § 204 of a cross reference to
the definition of gain in §§ 111-113, made applicable by
the general provisions of the Act, not only excluded that
'definition from § 204, but substituted a different one
not specifically mentioned in that or any other section.
The gain taxed by § 204 (b) (1) is therefore that defined
by §§ 111-113, which may constitutionally be taxed.
Both questions are answered "No."
