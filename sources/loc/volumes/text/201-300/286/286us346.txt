expiring moments. To 1rotect through a receiver* the
enjoyment of the corporate privilege and then to use the
appointment as a barrier to the collection of the tax that
should accompany enjoyment would be an injustice to
the State and a reproach to equity.
A word in conclusion should be said as to United States
v. Whitridge, qupra. The court held in that case that a
corporation operating through a receiver is not subject
to a federal tax imposed as an excise on the actual doing
of business and to be measured by its fruits. The tax in
controversy is a State tax, and is laid not on the doing of
business, but on the mere privilege to do it. The State
decision as to its meaning would control in case of conflict, but conflict there is none.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be
reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

ST. LOUIS SOUTHWESTERN RAILWAY CO. v.
SIMPSON, ADMINISTRATRIX.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 674.

Argued April 25, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

A locomotive engineer moved his train from a siding to the main
line in neglect of an order to wait for the passing of another train.
His conductor, in the caboose at the other end of his train, had
his attention called to the possible danger, but deferred applying
the air brakes while he consulted his own orders to make sure
whether the order to wait had been countermanded. ° Almost immediately came a collision in which the engineer was killed. Held:
1. The casualty was attributable to the engineer's negligence.

Argument for Petitioner.

2. The inaction of the conductor, if it amounted to negligence,
was not such as to evoke the doctrine of last clear chance, since (1)
it was not reckless indifference to a duty to counteract a peril
perceived and understood, and (2) it was substantially concurrent
with the engineer's negligence. P. 350.

doctrine could not apply here, because the engineer's
violation of his order continued as a proximate cause of
the collision up to the moment of the collision. St. Louis

Mr. Frank Pace for respondent.
in no one of the cases relied on by petitioner was the
issue of discovered peril, or the doctrine of last clear
chance, in any way involved. In each the contention of
the party seeking recovery was that the injury was caused
by the concurrent and contemporary negligence of the
party injured and certain other servants of the railroad
company, and recovery was sought under the doctrine of
comparative negligence.
The doctrine of last clear chance, or discovered peril,
applies in every case where the defendant discovers the
negligence of the plaintiff and the peril thereby created,
in time, by the exercise of reasonable care after discovering such peril, to avoid the injury, but fails to use the
means available to him to prevent the injury. Inland

Opinion of the Court.

c. 149, § 1, 35 Stat. 65; U. S. Code, Title 45, § 51) to recover damages for his death. She had a verdict in her
favor in the Circuit Court of Prairie County, Arkansas,
and the Supreme Court of the State affirmed. 184 Ark.
633; 43 S. W. (2d) 251. The case is here on certiorari.
Simpson was the engineer of No. 775, an extra train
engaged in interstate commerce. Before leaving Pine
Bluff, Arkansas, he received a written train order, No.
104, notifying him to proceed south to the cross-over at
McNeil, Arkansas, and there wait upon a siding until
another train, No. 18, going north, had arrived and passed.
On arriving at McNeil, Simpson took his train, consisting
of 43 freight cars, upon the siding at the cross-over, but
did not wait there. He had received at McNeil another
order (train order No. 132) notifying him that another
train (second 18) was to meet him farther south at
Stamps. The conjecture is offered that he confused train
No. 18 with, second No. 18, though there is no dispute
that to a railroad employee the description was entirely
intelligible, trains of the same number being designated
as first, second, third and so forth. At all events, Simpson instead of waiting at the siding moved out upon the
main track. About a mile away there was a head-on
collision between his train and No. 18, in which he and
others were killed.
The respondent admits, as she admitted on the trial,
that the engineer was negligent and rests her right to recover upon what is characterized as the doctrine of "the
last clear chance." To bring that doctrine into play she
relies upon these facts: At the end of the long train of 43
freight cars was a caboose in which the conductor and two
brakemen rode. The brakemen say that as the train left
the siding, they remembered the first order and asked the
conductor whether any new ones contradicting it had
come into his hands. Not hearing of any, they called out

to apply the air brakes, and one of them offered to do so
himself. This the conductor forbade, and said to bring
him the written orders which were in the cupola of the
caboose, so that he might read them again. This was
done at once. While the orders were in the conductor's
hands and he was reading them again, the collision occurred.
The facts so summarized are insufficient to relieve the
engineer from the sole responsibility for the casualty that
resulted in his -death. What was said by this court in
Davis v. Kennedy, 266 U. S. 147, might have been written
of this case. "It was the personal duty of the' engineer
positively to ascertain whether the other train had passed.
His duty was primary as he had physical control of No.
4, and was managing its course. It seems to us a perversion of the statute to allow his representative to recover for an injury due to his failure to act on the ground
that possibly it might have been prevented if those in
secondary relation to the movement had done more." See
also UnadillaRy. Co. v. Caldine, 278 U. S. 139; Frese v.
Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 263 U. S. 1, 3; Great Northern
Ry. Co. v. Wiles, 240 U. S. 444, 448.
We do not need to inquire whether a different conclusion would follow if. the conductor in the caboose had discovered that the engineer had gone upon the main track
through a misunderstanding of a later order, and discovering this, had failed after a substantial interval of
time to give warning of a peril that he could have easily
averted. Nothing of the kind appears. There is an absenW of the essential factors that wake into life the doctrine of the lAst clear chance. In the first place, the conductor did not know any more than Simpson did that an
order had b~een violated. He was distrustful of his memory, and was looking at the written orders at the moment
of the collision. Negligent he may have been, but not

recklessly indifferent to a duty to counteract a peril perceived and understood. Woloszynowski v. N. Y. C. R.
Co., 254 N. Y. 206; 172 N. E. 471; Inland & Seaboard
Coasting Co. v. Tolson, 139 U. S. 551, 558. In the second place, the negligence of the engineer and the negligence of the conductor were substantially concurrent.
The negligence of the engineer was a continuing one (St.
Louis & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Schumacher, 152 U. S.
77, 81), for he was under a duty from the moment that
he went. out on the main track to return to a place of
safety. The negligence of the conductor in failing to
:give warning was not separated by any considerable interval from the consequences to be averted, nor is there
any satisfactory proof that warning, if given, would have
been effective to avert them. The transaction from start
to finish must have been a matter of seconds only. In
the brief for the respondent iuice calculations are submitted in an attempt to prove that if the conductor had
applied the brakes at once, his train could have been
stopped at a point that would have separated it by a
space of approximately half a mile from train No. 18
rushing on from the south, and that if all this had happehed, the engineer of No. 18 might have noticed the
stationary train in time to stop his own and thus prevent
collision. Calculations so nice are unavailing to prove
anything except the unity of the whole transaction. The
several acts of negligence were too closely welded together in time as well as in quality to be viewed as independent. Kansas City Southern Ry. v. Ellzey, 275 U.
S. 236, 241.
