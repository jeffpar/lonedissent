not specifically referred to in the Supplement.'
It would be going very far in the circumstances to say
that the mere omission from § 204 of a cross reference to
the definition of gain in §§ 111-113, made applicable by
the general provisions of the Act, not only excluded that
'definition from § 204, but substituted a different one
not specifically mentioned in that or any other section.
The gain taxed by § 204 (b) (1) is therefore that defined
by §§ 111-113, which may constitutionally be taxed.
Both questions are answered "No."

system of taxation as the filing of returns, time of payment, or penalties for non-payment; and no express reference isimade to the obviously applicable general provisions touching upon these matters: §§ 52,

not included or referred to in Supplement G, may be found in §§ 105,

way, to an amount sufficient to pay for some bonds, which the bank
had undertaken to purchase for him. Thereafter the officer told him
that he had his bonds, and handed him a charge slip showing the
cost, including principal, accrued interest and commission. The
total was charged against the depositor's account, and was credited
as a "deposit" in a "bond account ",appearing on the bank's books.
When the bank soon afterwards closed its doors, it was discovered
that in fact no bonds had been purchased, ordered, or received for
the depositor.

a judgment against the receiver of a bank in a suit for

The general rule-is that distribution of the assets of a
national bank must be made in accordance with § 5236,
R. S., 12 U. S. C., c. 2, § 194, which requires a pro rata
distribution amongst all creditors. Cook County Nat.
Bank v. United States, 107 U. S.445.
Except for preferences to the United States the statute
contemplates absolute equality among creditors.
The courts have, however, established .a basis for another class of preferred claims, namely, where the applicant can show that the receiver has, among the assets
acquired by him; identifiable property belonging to the
claimant. In working out the formula or procedure for
establishing such claims, the federal courts have held gen-.
erally that claimant must show that from his transaction
with the bank before suspension (a) the bank received
property of the claimant in trust, (b) that -the propetty
actually augmented the existing assets (as distinguished
from the addition of a bookkeeping credit), and () that

the augmented assets, or the proceeds thereof, are traceable into the. assets taken over by the receiver. See Empire State Surety. Co..v. Carroll County, 194 Fed. 593;

U. S.715; Larabee Flour Mills v. First Nat. Bank, 13 F.
(2d) 330, cert. den. 273 U. S. 727. This same doctrine of
augmentation and tracing is also established by the state
courts of Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, and
Washington.
The burden is upon the claimant to trace the proceeds
to the receiver or trustee. See Schuyler v. Littlefield,
232 U. S. 707; Cunningham v. Brown, 265 U. S. 1; St.
Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Spiller, 274 U. S.304.
There has been neither augmentation nor tracing to the
receiver in this case.
It will be noted that the agreement between the parties
contenplated the use of the deposit balance at a future
date 'in the same manner as if at such future date the
depositor had drawn a check to the bank for the amount
of the cuntemplated purchase price of the bonds.
Th9 use of the $2,100 check did not, on October 15, augment the assets of the bank, since it was used in the clearings_ to pay the bank's-obligations. Empire State,Surety

claimant, and once it is dissipated it can not be treated

Argument for Respondent.

The record does not disclose any express agreement
that any portion of the bank's cash funds would be segregated; or that such.funds would be impressed with a trust
for that purpose. The existence of a trust igreement is
entirely inconsistent with the deposit of the additional
$2,100 in the savings account with the understanding that
it should remain on deposit in that account and that the
account would later be charged with the purchase price.
The theory of tracing trust funds or property necessarily implies that there is a fund or res to be followed.

delivered the opinion of the Court

Respondent brought suit against the petitioner, receiver
of The First National Bank of New Bern, North Carolina, an insolvent national bank, to recover money alleged
to have beenpaid to the bank upon trust for the purchase, for respondent, of United States bonds. Judgment
of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for respondent, was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 52 F. (2d)

The case was tried to the court without a jury and the
facts are not 'in dispute. Respondent maintained an in-

terest-bearing savings account with the bank, in which
his credit balance on October 14, 1929, was $1,961.31.
Shortly before that date, respondent had had conversations with an officer of the bank in the course of which the
latter signified the willingness of the bank to purchase
$4,000 of United States bonds for respondent. On October 10 he stated to respondent that the bank would send
to Richmond for the bonds and asked iirn to bring to
the bank on the 14th such amount, in addition to his
credit balance, as would be required to pay for the bonds.
On the, latter date respondent drew a check for $2,. 30
upon another bank, which he deposited in his savings account, thus increasing his deposit balance to $4,061.31.
On the 15th, the same officer of the bank informed respondent that the bonds had been ordered and on the
19th said to him, " I have your bonds," and handed to him
a charge slip which stated: "This is to advise you that we
have this day charged your account as follows:
"4,000 Fourth L. L. 4Y4% Bonds .......... $3, 960.00
60
A ce. Int ...................................
4 00
Comn ision ..............................
$3,964.60"

On October 21, the bank charged respondent's savings account on its books with $3,964.60, and credited a likc
amount as a "deposit" in a, bond account " appearing
on its books. The bond account contained only a daily
record of credits in the account of checks and depbsits
and their total, without any reference to respondent .or
any other customer of the: bank. The nature and purpose of the account does not- otherwise appear. When
the bank closed its doors on October 26, it was discovered
that in fact no bonds had been purchased, ordered, or
received for the respondent. The only transactions had
with respect to respondent or. his account were the con-

versations with the officer of the bank and the entry of
the debit and credit items mentioned.
On these facts, the District Court concluded that. the
bank had received the $3,964.60 in trust for the purpose
of purchasing the bonds and that as the funds in the
hands of the receiver had been augmented by the wrongful commingling of the trust fund with the other funds
of the bank, respondent was entitled to payment in preference to the general creditors of the bank. The -Court
of Appeals thought that the trust arose only on the 19th,
when the bank stated that respondent's account had been
vharged with the purchase price of the bonds, but reached
the'same conclusion as respects the increase of the funds
in the hands of the receiver and the right of respondent
,to preferential payment.
The petitioner insists, as matter of law, that no trust
ever came into existence as the result of these transactions. He also relies on the facts that the $2,100 check
credited to respondent's account had been included in a
clearing house settlement of the bank with a correspondent, and its proceeds in the form of a draft for the balance
due upon the settlement had been endorsed and turned
over by the.New Bern bank to a third bank in settlement
of its account with the latter. From this it is argued
that the check did not augment the bank's funds, and
that the'proceeds could not be traced into the hands of
the receiver; hence, as to them the respondent could not
be preferred over general creditors.
As we tonclude that petitioner's first position is well
taken, it is unnecessary to consider the second. It would
have been equally competent for respondent to have protrided for the purchase of the bonds either by the creation
of a trutt of funds in the hands of the bank, to be used
f6r that purpose, or by establishing with it a credit to be
debited with the cost of the bonds when purchased.' But
only if tle former was the method adopted, could respond-

ent, upon the bank's insolvency and failure to purchase
the bonds, recover the fund or its proceeds,, if traceable,
,in preference to general creditors, see Minard v. Watts,
186 Fed. 245; Fallgatterv. Citizens' National Bank, 1:1 F.
(2d) 383; Northern Sugar Corp. v. Thompson, 13 F. (2d)'
829.
The relationship established between the bank and respondent by his savings account was, from its inception,
that of debtor and creditor, and the credit balance of
$1,961.31 in respondent's account on October 14 represented 'the amount of the bank's indebtedness to him.
Planters'Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 501; Phoenix
Bank v. Risley, 111 U. S. 125; Manhattan Bank v. Blake,
148 U. S. 412, 425, 426.
Although there had been anticipatory talk of the purchase of bonds, and the bank's officer had stated that they
would be purchased, nothing ksid-or done before the 14th
purported to carry out the proposal or t6 alter the relationship established by the savings_ account. .n that
date respondent's credit balance was augmented by the
deposit of the $2,100 check, made in conformity to theusual course of business with respect to deposit accounts.
Respondent obviously did not alter the debit and'vedit
relationship with respect to the $1,961.31 balanc by asking the bankto purchase bonds, or by handing to the bank
the deposited check of $2,100. All that happened on that
date was equally inconsistent with any purpose to create a
trust of the check or its proceeds, and showed unmistakably that the amount of the check, as in the case of any
other deposit in the savings account, was to-be added to
the existing balance and treated like it. In making the deposit, respondent used the customary form of deposit slip
and, in accordance with its instructions, the deposit was
credited by the bank in the usual manner, both in his
passbook and in his savings account on its own book.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

After the deposit of the check, as before, the- bank remained a debtor and the respondent a. creditor for the
amount of the credit balance.
The situation thus created continued without change
until the 19th, when the bank's officer advised respondent that the bonds had been purchased. If the advice
was true, as respondent believed it to be, he was then
called upon to pay to the bank the amount of the purchase price, and the bank proceeded, with the assent of
the respondent, to liquidate the supposed obligation by
charging his savings account with the exact amount of
the stated purchase price, with interest and commissions
added. We can find in this method of discharging a supposed obligation no hint of an. intended alteration of the
debtor and creditor relationship, with which respondent
had been content from the beginning, to that of trustee
and cestui que trust.
The court below thought that the legal consequence
to be attributed to the debiting of the account with the
supposed purchase price of the bonds was the same as
if the respondent had cashed a check for the amount
and had then proceeded to hand the money back to the
bank under a specific agreement between him and the
bank that the money was to be held as a special fund, for
,the sole purpose of completing the purchase. This view
is not without support. See Davis v. McNair, 48 F. (2d)
494; State v. Grills, 35 R. I. 70, 75; 85 Atl. 281; Northwest Lumber Co. v. Scandinavian American Bank, 130

MACDONALD v. PLYMOUTH TRUST CO. 263
254

Statement of the Case.

Such a procedure, if actually carried out, might afford a
basis, which is lacking here, for the inference that re,spondent, no longer content with 'the r6le of creditor, had
sought to establish a trust fund. But the mere debiting
of his account, without more, for the reimbursement of
the bank for the obligation which it was supposed to have
incurred or paid, lends no support to such an inference.
The cancellation of the credit balance by the debit neither
suggests any intention to establish a trust nor points to
any identifiable thing which could be the subject of it.The debit entry may be disregarded, because respondent's assent to it was procured by a false statement; but
the only consequence is that his status as a creditor is
unaffected and he is entitled only to share in the funds
of the bank on an equal footing'with other creditors who
similarly are the victims of its insolvency.
