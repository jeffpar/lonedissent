SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO. ET AL. v. DANTZLER,
ADMINISTRATRIX.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 787.

Submitted April 28, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

Decided upon the authority of the case last preceding.
166 S. C. 148; 164 S. E. 434, reversed.

Messrs. H. O'B. Cooper, Sidney S. Alderman, Frank G.
Tompkins, and S. R. Prince submitted for petitioners.
Mr. William C. Wolfe submitted for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a companion case to No. 788, Southern Ry. Co.
v. Youngblood, decided this day, ante, p. 313. The respondent's intestate was the engineer of the train known
as Extra 483 West. He had on his person after the accident his copy of the orders received at Branchville. The
negligence claimed is practically the same as in No. 788,
and none is alleged as against any member of the decedent's crew or that of the train tvith which his engine
collided. After the accident Dantzler was taken to a
hospital, where before his death he stated to two persons
that the accident was his fault-that he forgot his orders
and ran past the point where he was directed to pass the
other train.

1. The general principle underlying the income tax statutes ever since
the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment has been the computa-'
tion of gains and losses on the basis of an annual accounting for the
transactions of the year. P. 326.
2. A taxpayer who seeks an allowance for losses suffered in an earlier
year, must be able to point to a ipecific provision of the statute
permitting the deduction, and must bring himself within its terms.
Id.
3. The popular or received import oi words furnishes the general rule
for the interpretation of public laws. P. 327.
4. A construction that would engender mischief should be avoided.
P. 329.
5. Section 206 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, permitted any taxpayer who sustained a net loss in one year to deduct it in computing his net income for the next year and, if it exceeded -that net
income (computed without such deduction), to deduct the excess
in computing the net income for the next succeeding (" third ")
year. By other provisions of the. same Act, ยง 240 (a) and (b)
affiliated corporations could make consolidated returns of net income upon the -basis of which the tax was to be computed as a
unit and then be assessed to the respective corporations in such
proportions as they might agree upon or, if they did not agree, then
on the basis of the net income properly assi6nable to each. Held:
(1) Where one of two corporations which became affiliated in
1927 had no net income that year, its net losses for 1925 and 1926
were not deductible in their consolidated return of net income for
1927. P. 326.
(2) Each of the corporations joined in a consolidated return is
