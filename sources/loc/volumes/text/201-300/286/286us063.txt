U. S. v. COMMERCIAL CREDIT CO.
Syllabus.

manufacture, taxation and traffic in intoxicating liquors
and all penalties for their violation in force when the
National Prohibition Act was adopted, were continued
in force except such provisions as are "directly in conflict with the provisions of the National Prohibition Act."
See United States v. Stafoff, 260 U. S. 477. The advocates of an implied repeal insist that there is a direct
conflict between a statute whereby immunity for innocent
lienors or owners is given as of right and a statute
whereby immunity is on the footing of an act of. grace. To
this the retort is made by the opponents of repeal that the
spheres of the two immunities are diverse and that the
apparent conflict is unreal. Transportation within the
United States is the sphere of the one, and importation
from without the sphere of the other.
Of the four questions certified, those numbered two and
three are adequately answered when we answer question
number one.
The answer to question four may depend upon circumstances imperfectly disclosed in the certificate, and is not
shown to be necessary. White v. Johnson, 282 U. S.367..
The second, third and fourth questions are not answered, and the first question is answered "No."

and decision of this case.

CERTIORARI, 285 U. S. 534, to review the reversal of

a judgment of the District Court forfeiting automobiles
which had been seized and libeled by the United States
for breach of the customs laws. The above-named respondent, claiming as bona fide lienor, filed an intervening petition, which was dismissed.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher', and Messrs. Arthur W. Henderson, Paul D. Miller, and Carroll P. Lynch were on the
brief, for: the United States.
Mr. Duane R. Dills, with whom Mr. Berthold Muecke,
Jr., was on the brief, for respondent.
The respondent asks that this Court give effect to the
express intention of Congress that the rights of innocent
parties be protected where transportation of intoxicating
liquor is involved. It is true that executive clemency
may remit the forfeiture, but mitigation by grace is not
the equivalent of statutory immunity. United States v.
The Sebastopol, 56 F. (2d) 590, s. c., post, p. 70. This
is so particularly since the decision of the executive is
not subject to review. U. S. ex rel. Walter E. Heller &
Co. v. Mellon, 40 F. (2d) 808, 810, cert. den., 281 U. S. 766.
The reason for holding that the mandatory features of
§ 26 of .the Prohibition Act supplant R. S., § 3450, in
taxation cases, apply equally to R. S. §§ 3061 and 3062,
in these customs cases. United States V. One Mack Truck,
4 F. (2d) 923; United States v. Almeida, 9 F. (2d) 15,
:16; United States v. One Ford Coupe, 43 F. (2d)'212, 214.

U. S. v. COMMERCIAL CREDIT CO.

Argument for Respondent.

The Willis-Campbell Act did not re-enact R. S. §§ 3061
and 3062, because they are in direct conflict with theprovisions of the National Prohibition Act relative to trans
portation in customs cases in that they provide for absolute forfeiture of the rights of the innocent, while the
National Prohibition Act protects the innocent. United
States v. One Packard Truck, 284 Fed. 394; United States
v. One Studebaker, 45 F. (2d) 430; United States v. One
Ford Coupe, 43 F. (2d) 212. Transportation is necessarily involved in importation, just as much as concealment was involved in the transportation in the Richbourg
case. Cf. Port GardnerInvestment Co. v. United States,
272 U. S. 564; Commercial Credit Co. v. United States,
276 U. S. 226; Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States,
281 U. S. 528; United States v. One Ford Coupe, "272
U. S. 321.
None of the vehicles in the cases at bar was used in
the "importation" of liquor. They were all used in
the transportation of liquor within the boundaries of
the United States after the importation had been completed. To this extent, the vehicles in this case are distinguished from the vehicles involved in General Motors
Accept. Corp. v. United States, ante, p. 49. See also National Bond & Inv. Co. v. United States, 8 F. (2d) 942.
If the substantive offense is importation and the customs laws are available to the Governmenf, then forfeiture might be had under those laws; if the substantive
offense is concealment with intent to defraud the Government of a tax, then forfeiture might be had under § 3450.
United States v. One Ford Coupe, supra. But if the dominating enterprise is transportation, then forfeiture must
be under § 26 of the National Prohibition Act. Commercial Credit Co. v. United States, supra; Richbourg Motor
Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. One Reo
Coupe, 46 F. (2d) 815; United States v. One Buick Coupe,
54 F. (2d) 800, 802.

OCTOtER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.
MR. JusTIcE CARDOZO

286 U.S

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Three motor cars were seized by a customs officer of the
United States in Texas near the Mexican border on a
charge that they were employed in the unlawful importation of intoxicating liquors.
Following the seizure, the Government filed a libel of
information against the automobiles so employed under
§§ 3061 and 3062 of the Revised Statutes (19 U. S. Code,
§§ 482 and 483) and prayed for a decree of forfeiture.
Thereupon, the Commercial Credit Company, Inc., the
holder of a chattel mortgage, filed an intervening petition
alleging that its lien had been created in good faith; that
it was innocent of any participation in the wrongful use
of the cars; and that by force of § 26 of the National Prohibition Act it should have an award of the possession.
The District Court dismissed the intervening claim and
adjiudged a forfeiture,- holding that §§ 3061 and 3062 of
the Revised Statutes were unrepealed by § 26 of the National Prohibition Act and permitted the forfeiture of
articles illegally employed in the importation of intoxicating liquors 46 F. (2d) 171. The Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed the decree and dismissed the libels, holding that § 26 of the National Prohibition Act had superseded other remedies, 53 F. (2d) 977. A writ of certiorari
has brought the case here.
Our judgment handed down herewith in General Motors
Acceptance Corp.v. United States, ante, p. 49, sustains the
position of the Government that vehicles employed in the
unlawful importation of intoxicating liquors may be
seized under the Tariff Act and the provisions of the Revised Statutes ancillary thereto. All that remains is to
determine whether these vehicles were so employed. The
.cars subjected to forfeiture in No. 574 were the same that
had brought the contraband merchandise. from beyond

Statement of the Case.

the Mexican border. The cars libeled in this proceeding
were laden with the liquors, for all that the evidence
shows, on this side of the border line.
The difference is not one that exacts differing relief.
The circumstantial evidence justifies a finding that the
cars, wherever laden, were implements or links in a continuous process of carriage from Mexico into Texas.
This was unlawful importation as well as unlawful transportation. The two courts below are in agreement as to
the inferences fairly to be gathered from the facts, and
their findings are not to be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. Washington Securities Co. v. United States,
234 U. S. 76, 78; Texas & N. 0. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of
Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548, 558.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be
reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.
Reversed.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

.No. 795.

Argued April 15, 1932.-Decided May 2, 1932.

1. Revised Statutes, § 4377, which provides that any licensed vessel
employed in any other trade than that for which she is licensed
shall be forfeited, applies to a vessel licensed only for the fishing
trade which carries a cargo of intoxicating liquors. P. 68.
2. Forfeiture under Rev. Stats., § 4377, is strictly in rem and (unlike
forfeiture under § 26 of the National Prohibition Act) is not
dependent upon a preliminary adjudication of personal guilt. P. 69.
56 F. (2d) 590, reversed.
