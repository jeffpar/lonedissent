These corporations are not identical with the unincorporated associations to whose principal assets they have succeeded, and the losses of the associations suffered in an

MICHIGAN v. MICHIGAN TRUST CO., RECEIVER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 598.

Argued April 19, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

1. The annual tax laid by § 4 of Act No. 233, Pub. Acts of Mich.,
1923, upon every local corporation "for the privilege of exercising
its franchise and of transacting its business within this State," has
been held by the state supreme court to be a tax on the privilege
to do business, not merely on the doing of it, and to be applicable
where the business is being conducted by a receiver, appointed for
the purpose of continuing it.. Held:
(1) The decision must be followed in a federal court receivership
as a binding construction of the local law. P. 342.
(2) A decision upholding the tax as applied to a receiver is
necessarily a construction of the statute, although the statute does
not mention receivers and its application to them was guided by
general principles as to the effect of a receivership. P. 343.
(3) The tax should be paid by the receiver as it accrues, as part
of the expense of administration; and where this was deferred until
the receivership developed from a merely protective into a winding
up process, the accumulated taxes must be paid in preference to the
claims of creditors. P. 344.
2. Receiverships for conservation should be watched with a jealous
eye, to avoid inequitable results. P. 345.
3. United States v. Whitridge, 231 U. S. 144, disti'nguished. P. 346.

CERTIORA1U, 284 U. S. 616, to review the reversal of an

order requiring the receiver of a corporation to pay accrued corporate franchise taxes before the claims of creditors. The order was made on petition of the State.
Mr. Edward A. Bilitzke, Assistant Attorney General of
Michigan, with whom Mr. Paul W. Voorhies, Attorney
General, was on the brief, for petitioner.
The court below erred in holding that the receiver did
not exercise any of the franchises of the corporation, and
that the receiver may perform, under the direction of
the court, any act which might be performed by any other
citizen in total disregard of the corporate capacity and
without any reliance upon its franchises. Union Steam

The ruling of the Supreme Court of Michigan should
be followed by federal courts.
Whether or not the tax is payable by a receiver depends
upon the nature of the tax, which can only be determined
by a construction of the particular statute.
Under § 65, Jud. Code, the federal receiver was required
"to manage and operate" the property " according to
the requirements of the valid laws of the State in which
such property shall be situated, in the same manner that
the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in
possession thereof."

Argument for Respondent.

286 U.S.

The court below was in error in holding that the limitation upon the power of a receiver to transact only corporate business arises solely by reason of the implied contract between the stockholders and the corporation, and
not from any dependence by the court upon the grant
of the powers enumerated in the charter. Safford v.
People, 85 Ill. 559; Louisville, N. A. & C. R. Co. v. Cauble,
46 Ind. 281; N. Y. Terminal Co. v. Gaus, 204 N. Y. 516.
The court below erred in making a distinction between
a public utility corporation and a private corporation,
indicating that in the case of a public utility corporation
a receiver would be liable for the corporation privilege
tax. Mather's Sons Co. Case, 52 N. J. Eq. 607; Providence Engineering Corp. v. Downey Shipbuilding Corp.

People v. Hopkins, 18 F. (2d) 731; In re Malko Milling
& L. Co., 32 F. (2d) 825.
The taxes are payable even though the receiver did not
exercise any of the corporate franchises. The tax is "imposed upon a corporation organized" under the laws of
Michigan, regardless of whether the corporation does any
business within the State. Cf. State v. Bradley, 207 Ala.
677.
Mr. Benjamin P. Merrick for respondent.
The decision below was not based upon an interpretation of the act. The language, which omits all reference
to corporate receivers, is clear and unambiguous, leaving
no room for interpretation. The receiver may be said to
be "casus omissus."
The undeniable conflict between the court below and
the Michigan supreme court was solely upon the fundamental question of law: Does the receiver of a corporation,

in operating the business thereof, exercise its franchises?
In basing its decision upon an affirmative answer to this
question, the state court manifestly took a position upon
several questions of law not at all local in character. In
determining what the correct applicable principles. are,
this Court, by its own decisions, is free (as was the court
below) to exercise independent judgment. Swift v. Tyson,
16 Pet. 1; Olcott v. Fond du Lac Co., 16 Wall. 678; Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S. 20; Baltimore etc. R. Co. v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Argument for Respondent.

286 U.S.

The theory that the functional powers of a mercantile
corporation are separable from the general franchise by
which it exists, is unsound. Its powers of action, as a
corporation, can no more be detached from the body and
passed to another than can the physical powers or civil
capacity of a natural person. And merely because the
corporate functional powers, or the tangible business fruits
thereof, may be subjected to specific taxation, it by no
means follows that those power&are indispensable to one
who, like the receiver of a mercaitile corporation, succeeds to the operation of the business.
We submit that those powers which, together, constitute the functional capacity of a mercantile corporation
are not, in any accurate sense, franchises at all. They
are not intrinsically unique; they become peculiar only
when conferred upon the corporation as accessory attributes without which it could'not function as a living
organism; and they are indispensable only to the corporation as such. Slee v. Broom, 19 Johns. (N. Y.) 456, 473474; Warner v. Beers, 23 Wend. (N. Y.) 103, 145; Thompson v. Waters, 25 Mich. 214, 223-224; Methodist Church
v. Clark, 41 Mich. 730, 736.
The appointment of the receiver did not divest the
corporation of its franchises, nor did they ipso facto
lapse. Boston Glass Mfg. Co. v. Langdon, 24 Pick. 49;
In re G. H. Hammond Co., 246 Mich. 179, 182.
In view of Cady ,vKnit Goods Mfg. Co., 48 Mich. 133
and Jacobs v. E. Bement's Sons, 161 Mich. 415, it is clear
that a receiver of a Michigan corporation appointed in
dissolution proceedings and vested by statute with power
to conduct the business can not be said to derive any
of these powers from the corporate franchises, for they
are gone.
The legal capacity of the respondent to act at all is
obviously derived from its own corporate organization as
a trust company. Every power it possessed in its ca-

Opinion of the Court.

pacity as receiver it derived, not from the Worden Grocer
Company or the corporate franchises thereof, but from the
appointing court. It took over and managed the property not by sufferance of the corporate owner thereof,
but by authority and as an officer of the court.
The court below was sound in holding United States V.
Whitridge, 231 U. S. 144, to be controlling in principle.
Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107.
Other decisions in principle support the exemption of
the respondent, as receiver, from a purely implied tax
liability. United States v. Wigglesworth, 2 Story 369;
Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578; Gould v. Gould, 245
U. S. 151; Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U. S. 55; Smietanka
v. First Trust & Savings Bank, 257 U. S. 602; Reinecke v.
Gardner, 277 U. S. 239.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.
A petition by the People of the State of Michigan that
a receiver appointed by a federal court be directed to pay
out of the moneys in his hands corporate franchise taxes
due or claimed to be due to the People of the State was
granted by the District Court, and denied by the
Court of Appeals. 52 F. (2d) 842. The case is here on
certiorari.
At the suit of a simple contract creditor, a receiver of
the property of the Worden Grocer Company, a Michigan corporation, engaged in business at its doi uicile, was
appointed by a Federal District Court in Michigan on
February 9, 1926. The bill of complaint alleged that the
defendant was solvent, and that if its business was handled by a receiver free from interference by it§ creditors,
it would be able to pay its debts in full and Would have
a surplus available for preferred and commonf stockholders. On the same day the directors of the, defendant
adopted a resolution consenting to the receivership; and
an answer admitting the allegations of the bill of corn-

286 U.S.

plaint and consenting to the relief prayed for was filed
forthwith. Thereupon, and still on the same day, the
court made an order appointing the Michigan Trust Company receiver'of the defendant and of all its assets with
authority "to carry on the business now carried on by
the Worden Grocer Company, and to operate and manage its prolerty and business in such manner as will, in
the judgment of said Receiver, produce the most satisfactory results." To that end authority was granted "to
pay the current and unpaid payrolls of said defendant;
to incur such obligations and indebtedness, . . . the same
to be prior to the present unsecured obligation" of the
defendant, . . . "as to the Receiver may seem necessary
for continuance of the business," and in particular "to
pay all taxes and assessments levied upon the property
and assets of said company," as well as all rentals accrued
or to accrue thereafter
The receiver so appointed carried on the business thus
committed to its charge. It continued to do this till December 30, 1929, when the court made an order confirming a sale of all the mercantile assets, as a result of which
sale there was paid to the common creditors a dividend of
25%. Cash and unsold real estate are still in the receiver's custody.
In February, 1930, the People of the State filed in the
District Court a petition that the receiver be directed to
pay the corporate taxes or privilege fees for the years
1925 to 1929 inclusive, amounting in the aggregate to
$10,988.36. The liability of the receiver in respect of
such fees or taxes is the subject of this controversy. The
District Court held that they were charges upon the assets prior to the claims of creditors in that they were expenses necessarily incurred by the receiver in fulfilling
the duty to operate the business. The Court of Appeals
held that they were liabilities due to the People of the
State, but liabilities not to be discharged until the claims

MICHIGAN v. MICHIGAN TRUST CO.
334

Opinion of the Court.

of all other creditors as well as the expense of the receivership had been satisfied in full.
By a statute of Michigan enacted in 1923 (Act No.
233, Public Acts 1923, § 4), "every corporation organized
or doing business under the laws of this state, excepting
those hereinafter expressly exempted therefrom, shall,
at the time of filing its annual report with the secretary of
state of this state, as required by Section 7 hereof, for
the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting
its business within this state, pay to the secretary of state,
an annual fee of two and one-half mills upon each dollar
of its paid-up capital and surplus, but such privilege fee
shall in no case be less than ten dollars nor more than
fifty thousand dollars."
There were amendments of the statute in 1927 and
1929 (Act No. 140, Public Acts 1927; Act No. 175, Public
Acts 1929), but their significance in relation to this controversy is not important enough to make it necessary to
quote them.
The tax is laid upon the corporation "for the privilege
of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business
within this state." Whether a corporation does exercise
its franchise or transact its business within the meaning
of a statute so framed when it does business through a
receiver is a subject on which much subtle argument has
been expended by state and federal courts. Distinctions
have been drawn between receivers appointed to carry on
the business of a corporation with a view to the continuance of its corporate life, and receivers appointed in aid
of the dissolution of the corporation or the liquidation of
its business. See e. g., Collector of Taxes v. Railway, 234
Mass. 336; 125 N. E. 614; Ohio v. Harris, 229 Fed. 892,
901. Other distinctions have been drawn between taxes
on a franchise to exist as a corporation and a franchise
for transacting business, or, as many of the cases put it,
between a franchise to "be" and a franchise to "do."

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

See e. g., Cobbs & Mitchell v. Tax Appeal Board, 252
Mich. 478, 481; 233 N. W. 386. Even where the tax is
on a franchise to "do," there is wide diversity of judgment. The wording of some statutes has been read by
some courts as importing the doing of business in the
usual course by agents and officers appointed in the usual
way. United States v. Whitridge, 231 U. S. 144, 149.
Wording only slightly different has been thought by other
courts to include the operations of a business conducted
by receivers. Central Trust Co., v. N. Y. C. & N. R. Co.,
110 N. Y. 250; 18 N. E. 02; N. Y. Terminal Co. v. Gaus,
204 N. Y. 512; 98 N. E. 11; Re U. S. Car Co., 60 N. J. Eq.
514; 43 Atl. 673; Armstrong v. Emmerson, 300 Ill. 54;
132 N. E. 768; People v. Hopkins, 18-F. (2d) 731. Other
wording not unlike has been held to import the imposition of a burden on the mere privilege to "do," though no
business was in fact transacted by the directors or by any
one (In re G. H. Hammond Co., 246 Mich. 179; 224 N. W.
655; New York v. Jersawit, 263 U. S. 403, 495), a construction whereby the tax on the privilege to do becomes
closely assimilated, in respect of domestic corporations, to
one on the privilege to be. In re G. H. Hammond Co.,
supra.
We are not required to choose from these diversities
the construction that would appeal to us as the most consonant with reason if choice were wholly free. Choice, As
it happens, is not free, for our task is to ascertain the
meaning of a Michigan statute, and as to that the courts
of the State, if they have spoken, pronounce the final
word. The decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan
in Re Detroit PropertiesCorporation,254 Mich. 523; 236
N. W. 850, is a controlling adjudication as to the meaning
and application of the privilege fee exacted of Michigan
corporations. The court held that the tax was imposed
upon the privilege to "do "; that this privilege existed
though nothing was ever done; that the order appointing

MICHIGAN v. MICHIGAN TRUST CO.
334

343

Opinion of the Court.

a receiver to continue the business did not divest the
privilege; that the only effect of such an order was to
nominate the person who was to exercise the "powers
belonging to the corporation by legislative grant; " and
hence that within the meaning of the statute the corporation retained a "privilege of exercising its franchise and
of transacting its business," for which a tax was due.
Cf. Central Trust Co. v. N. Y. C. & N. R. Co., supra; Ohio
v. Harris,supra; People v. Hopkins, supra; In re G. H.
Hammond Co., supra. The significance of this decision is
not avoided by the suggestion that the court in determining the application of the tax was guided by general
principles s to the effect of a receivership, and not by any
provision expressly covering receiverships in the body of
the statute. This does not detract from the quality of
the judgment as an expression of the local law. Problems
of statutory construction do not arise unless the meaning
of a statute is obscure or uncertain in its relation to a set
of facts, and obscurities or uncertainties thus arising are
not susceptible of settlement unless the words of the
statute are read in a setting of common law implications,
a background of common law doctrine, giving meaning
and perspective to a vague and imperfect outline. Ward
v. Erie R. Co., 230 N. Y. 230, 234; 129 N. E. 886; Murray
v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co., 62 Fed. 24, 31; United States
v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 654; Rice v. Railroad
Co., 1 Black 358, 374, 375. The Supreme Court of Michigan in deciding the Detroit Properties case had to make
answer to the question whether the legislature of the State
in imposing a tax upon the privilege of exercising a franchise intended to reach a situation where the business of
the corporation was conducted through the arm of a
receiver. The tax, if there was any, could have no origin
independent of the provisions of the statute, and any
decision upholding or annulling it is one involving inescapably a construction of 'the statute. Cf. New York v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

286 U.S.

Jersawit, 263 U. S. 493, 495; Mason v. Unitec States, 260
U. S. 545, 555, 556; Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial
Comm., 255 U. S. 445, 448; Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U. S.
101, 110.
We hold, therefore, in submission to the local law, that
the corporation, th6 Worden Grocer Company, was still
subject to the tax though it was in the hands of a receiver.
The decision of the court below apparently concedes as
much, but maintains that the tax must be paid by the
corporation and not by the receiver, with the result that
the State is subordinated to all the other creditors. We
find no warrant for the discrimination either in the provisions of any statute or in any principle of equity governing the distribution of a fund in the hands of a receiver.
On the contrary, statute and doctrine point the other way.
Viewing the receivership in its true light as one, not to
wind up the corporation, but to foster the assets, we think
the annual taxes accruing while the receiver was in charge
must be deemed expenses of administration and therefore charges to be satisfied in preference to the claims of
general creditors. They are so treated in the order by
which the receiver was appointed. By the order the
receiver is directed in continuing the business to pay taxes
and rentals and any other exppnses necessary to enable the
business to go on, and to give such payments priority over
other debts and obligations. These. privilege fees were
charges of the nature there, described. Taxes owing to
the Government, whether due at the beginning of a receivership or subsequently accruing, are the price that
business has to pay for protection and. security. Coy v.
Title Guardntee& Trust Co., 220 Fed. 90, 92. The privilege fees, being taxes, were expenses of administration
within the very terms of the order, but in addition they
were taxes of such a kind that the corporation by failing
to pay them became subject, if the State. so elected, to a
forfeiture of its franchise. Act No. 172, Public Acts

334

345

Opinion of the Court.

1923, § 7; cf. Turner v. Western Hydro-Electric Co., 241
Mich. 6; 216 N. W. 476. The receiver was under a duty
to pay them when they accrued, and having failed to fulfill that duty then, it should be compelled to pay them
now. The decisions as to this are persuasive and uniform.
Coy v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co., supra; Bright v.
Arkansas, 249 Fed. 950; McFarlandv. Hurley, 286 Fed.
365; People v. Hopkins, 18 F. (2d) 731, 733; cf. In re
Tyler, 149 U. S. 164, 182.
If the receivership were to be viewed as equivalent to
one for the liquidation of the business, the result would
not be different, and this for the reason, without considering any other, that it was not such a receivership when
the suit was instituted. It was then, as we have pointed
out, a receivership for the conservation of the assets of
a corporation believed to be completely solvent. If it
ever lost its original quality and became a winding up
receivership, the change was not earlier than the sale of
the mercantile assets in the latter part of 1929. Claims
of the State for taxes then accrued, instead of being
postponed to those of other creditors, are entitled to a
preference by the provisions of the local law. Sections
15315 and 15362, Compiled Laws of Michigan.
This court has had occasion to point out the abuses
that can arise from friendly receiverships forestalling the
normal process of administration in bankruptcy and enabling a tottering business to continue while creditors are
held at bay, Harkin v. Brundage, 276 U. S.36, 52, 54; cf.
Kingsport Press v. Brief English Systems, 54 F. (2d) 497,
499, 500. Receiverships for conservation have at times
a legitimate function, but they are to be watched with
jealous eyes lest their function be perverted. For -four
years the business of this corporation was carried on in
Michigan by a chancery receiver in the hope that winding up and dissolution would thereby be averted. There
should be no shift of the theory of the suit in these, its

expiring moments. To 1rotect through a receiver* the
enjoyment of the corporate privilege and then to use the
appointment as a barrier to the collection of the tax that
should accompany enjoyment would be an injustice to
the State and a reproach to equity.
A word in conclusion should be said as to United States
v. Whitridge, qupra. The court held in that case that a
corporation operating through a receiver is not subject
to a federal tax imposed as an excise on the actual doing
of business and to be measured by its fruits. The tax in
controversy is a State tax, and is laid not on the doing of
business, but on the mere privilege to do it. The State
decision as to its meaning would control in case of conflict, but conflict there is none.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be
reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.

No. 674.

Argued April 25, 1932.-Decided May 16, 1932.

A locomotive engineer moved his train from a siding to the main
line in neglect of an order to wait for the passing of another train.
His conductor, in the caboose at the other end of his train, had
his attention called to the possible danger, but deferred applying
the air brakes while he consulted his own orders to make sure
whether the order to wait had been countermanded. ° Almost immediately came a collision in which the engineer was killed. Held:
1. The casualty was attributable to the engineer's negligence.
