CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MINNESOTA.

No. 526.

Argued February 16, 1934.-Decided March 5, 1934.

War risk insurance money paid to the estate of the insured soldier is
subject to the claims of his creditors. P. 476.
180 Minn. 383; 249 N.W.417, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 620, to review the affirmance of a
judgment of a District Court of Minnesota entered on
appeal from a Probate Court. This is a continuation of
the litigation reported sub nom. Pagel v. MacLean, 283
U.S. 266.

Mr. George L. Barnard,with whom Mr. L. D. Barnard

was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Charles A. Swenson for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether war risk insurance money paid to the estate of an insured soldier is
exempt from the claims of his creditors. Title 38, U.S.
Code, contains the applicable statutes. They are: §454:
"The . . . insurance . . . shall not be subject to the

claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is
made "; § 511: "In order to give to every commissioned
officer and enlisted man . . . protection for themselves
and their dependents, the United States . . . shall grant
• . . life insurance . . . payable only to a spouse, child,

grandchild, parent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew,
niece, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or to any or all
of them"; § 514: " . . . If the designated beneficiary

...survives the insured and dies prior to receiving all
of the two hundred and forty installments or all such as
are payable and applicable, there shall be paid to the

estate of the insured the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable."
Jacob E. Hallbom, the insured soldier, obtained a ten
thgusand dollar policy and designated as beneficiary his
fatier, Peter J. Hallbom. He died intestate October 20,
1925, leaving no spouse or child. He was survived by his
father and others within the permitted class of beneficiaries. Thereupon, until the death of the father, February 22, 1928, the Bureau paid him the monthly installments according to the terms of the policy. He was survived by his wife, a son, a widow and child of a deceased
son (who died after the death of the insured), daughters,
and children of a deceased daughter. They were mother,
brother, sisters, sister-in-law, nephews and nieces of "the
insured.
The Bureau paid Pagel, administrator of the estate of
the insured, $9,116, being the value of the installments
payable after the death of the designated beneficiary.
The other assets in his hands were not sufficient to pay
expenses of administration or the claims of creditors,
which amounted to about $3,800. The probate court
directed payment of such claims. The mother, Selma
Hallbom, claiming under the War Risk Insurance Act to
be entitled to the entire sum as beneficiary, appealed to
the district court, which reversed the order of the probate
court. The state supreme court affirmed. 179 Minn.
402; 229 N.W. 344. It held the money not subject to
claims of creditors; that upon the death of the designated beneficiary the value of the unpaid installments
became payable to the estate of the insured for distribution to such persons then living and within the permitted class of beneficiaries, § 511, as would be entitled to
the personal property of the insured under Minnesota
intestacy laws, and that such persons were entitled as
beneficiaries and not as heirs.

Opinion of the Court.

Pending the application of the administrator for a writ
of certiorari, the mother died and, after the granting of the
writ, 282 U.S. 819, MacLean, who had been appointed
special administrator of her estate, was here substituted
as respondent. Her death having given rise to questions
involving the rights of persons who were not parties, we
vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further
proceedings. 283 U.S. 266. The state supreme court
remanded to the district court with the suggestion that
the brothers and sisters of the insured be made parties.
183 Minn. 429; 237 N.W. 21.
The surviving brother and sisters appeared and claimed
the insurance money as beneficiaries. The administrator
of the deceased brother intervened as a creditor and
prayed that his claim be paid out of the insurance money.
The children of the deceased son and daughter became
parties and prayed that, after payment of claims against
the estate of the insured, the residue be distributed to the
father and mother. The court held that, upon the death
of the designated beneficiary, the insurance money became an asset of the estate of the insured and subject to
the claims of creditors. It directed that the balance be
distributed to the heirs in accordance with state law, and
that heirship be determined as of the date of the death
of the insured. The surviving brother and sisters and the
special administrator of the mother appealed to the supreme court. That court, in view of Singleton v. Cheek,
284 U.S. 493, held its former decision erroneous and
affirmed the judgment of the district court. 189 Minn.
383; 249 N.W. 417. We granted a writ of certiorari.
* There is a conflict between decisions announced since our decision in Singleton v. Cheek (February 15, 1932), 284 U.S. 493. Hunt v.
Slagle (July 29, 1932),'45 Ga. App. 470; 165 S.E. 287, holds in favor
of the exemption. There is dictum to the same effect in Mixon v.
Mixon (November 23, 1932), 203 N.C. 566; 166 S.E. 516. And see
Brown v. United States (May 9, 1933), 65 F. (2d) 65.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Syllabus.

291 U.S.

In Singleton v. Cheek, supra, 496, we held that, when
the insured and designated beneficiary die successively
intestate, the commuted amount of the installments not
accrued when the beneficiary dies is to be paid to the
estate of the insured for distribution to his heirs and that
the heirs are to be determined as of the time of his death
in accordance with the laws of the state where he resided
and are not limited to the class of beneficiaries designated by the Act. The question whether insurance money
paid to the estate is subject to claims of creditors was not
involved in that case. The purpose of the exemption,
§ 454, is to safeguard to the insured soldier and the beneficiary payments made under the policy to them or for
their benefit.. Spicer v. Smith, 288 U.S. 430, 434. Upon
the death of the insured, the father whom he had designated as beneficiary was by the Bureau awarded monthly
payments to continue until death.

The language of the

statute limits the exemption to " any person to whom an
award is made." It is clear that the statute does not
extend the exemption beyond the insured and beneficiary.
And, as said by the state supreme court after referring
to our decision in Singleton v. Cheek, "it cannot be held
now that exemption of the fund survives both insured
and beneficiary for benefit of the heirs of the former."
