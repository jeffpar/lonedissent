HELVERING v. NEWPORT CO.
Statement of the Case.

HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. NEWPORT CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 515.

Argued February 15, 16, 1934.-Decided March 5, 1934.

1. Under § 280 (1) of the Revenue Act of 1926, an income and
excess profits tax which might lawfully have been assessed, under
an earlier Act, against a transferor of all of his property, before
the transfer, may be assessed against the transferee in the same
manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in
the case of a deficiency in a tax imposed by the 1926 Act. P. 487.
2. Under § 278 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, the time for assessment may be extended by waiver even though the period limited
for assessment by § 277 had expired before the waiver was given.
P. 488.
3. Any doubt that § 1106 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, in providing that the bar of the statute of limitations should not only
operate to bar the remedy but should extinguish the right, was
not intended to make § 278 (c)-the waiver section-inapplicable
to assessments barred by limitations, was removed by § 612,

Revenue Act of 1928, which repealed § 1106 (a) retroactively as
of the effective date of the 1926 Act. P. 489.
4. Congress, with the consent of the taxpayer, has power to re~stiblish his tax liability and to authorize assessment of the tax, even
though extinguished by the running of the statute of limitations,
and Congress evidenced that purpose by repealing § 1106 (a) as of
its effective date, leaving unaffected § 278 (c). P. 491.
5. An assessment made after time but with consent of the taxpayer
by waiver given under § 278 (c) was validated by the subsequent
act of Congress repealing § 1106 (a) as of its effective date.
Pp. 488-490.
65 F. (2d) 925, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 620, to review the affirmance of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 22 B.T.A. 833, overruling a deficiency assessment of income and profits taxes.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs and Messrs. Sewall Key and J. P. Jackson were on
the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Charles F. Fawsett, with whom Mr. Richard S.
Doyle was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case comes here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,
65 F. (2d) 925, affirming a decision of the Board of Tax
Appeals, that a deficiency assessment against respondent
as transferee of the assets of the Newport Chemical
Works, Inc., for 1917 income and profits taxes of the
transferor was barred by the statute of limitations.
In 1919 the Chemical Works, a Maine corporation,
after it had filed its tax return for 1917, transferred all its
assets to the respondent, a Delaware corporation, which,
as consideration for the transfer, issued its stock to the
stockholders of the transferor and assumed all liabilities of
the transferor. On March 1, 1920, the Supreme Court of
Maine entered a decree which purported to dissolve the
Chemical Works. The statutory period of limitation for
the assessment and collection of the 1917 taxes, as the
government concedes, expired on April 1, 1923, five years
after the return for that year had been filed. Whether this
period was extended by waiver so as to include the date of
deficiency assessment fixed by the Commissioner's sixtyday letter of March 14, 1927, depends on the validity and
effect of several documents filed. with the Commissioner
by the Chemical Works or by respondent.
During the period from December 15, 1920, to November, 1926, six documents, asserted by the government to
be waivers extending the time for assessment, were executed by the Chemical Works by an officer or its general
counsel, and lodged with the Commissioner. On or about
November 6, 1926, a further waiver extending the period

Opinion of the Court.

for assessment to December 31, 1927, executed by respondent by its president, was filed with the Commissioner.
The court below and the Board of Tax Appeals both
held, as respondent argues here, that the period for assessment and collection of the tax, which had been indefinitely
extended by the terms of the first waiver, was terminated
and the assessment barred on April 1, 1924, by a departmental ruling (Mimeograph 3085, II-1 Cum. Bull. 174,
April 11, 1923); that all the subsequent waivers; before
that of November 6, 1926, were void because they were
given by the Chemical Works, which had been previously
dissolved; and that, as the assessment against the Chemical Works had thus been barred prior to the Revenue Act
of 1926, the right to assess the respondent as transferee
could not, under the provisions of that Act, be revived
by respondent's waiver of November 6, 1926.
Several independent grounds are urged by the government to support the challenged deficiency assessment.
The only one which we need now consider is that the
waiver of November 6, 1926, unaided by the earlier ones,
extended the time for the assessment against the respondent, as transferee of the Chemical Works, until its expiry
date, December 31, 1927. Before that date the assessment had been made.
Respondent, as such transferee, became liable for any
tax which might have been lawfully assessed against its
transferor before the transfer, and § 280 (a) (1) of the
Act of 1926 directs that such liability "shall . . . be
assessed, collected and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case
of a deficiency in a tax imposed" by that Act. Phillipsv.
Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589. If, as respondent maintains
and as the court below held, any assessment was barred
before respondent's waiver of November 6, 1926, the effect
of that waiver upon the right to assess respondent pursuant to § 280 must be determined by the Revenue Act of
1926.

488

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

The provisions of the Act applicable to limitations and
waivers are found in §§ 277 and 278. Section 277 fixes
the period of limitation, but § 278 (c) provides:
"Where both the Commissioner and the taxpayer have
consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after
the time prescribed in section 277 for its assessment the
tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration
of the period agreed upon."
Had these provisions stood alone the waiver of November
6, 1926, if otherwise valid, would have extended the time
for assessment to the specified date, December 31, 1927,
even though it was made after the period for assessment
had expired. There is nothing in § 278 (c) or related
sections which requires that a waiver be given prior to
the expiration of the statutory period, and this Court has
uniformly held that, under the identical § 278 (c) of the
1924 Act, the defense of the statute of limitations may
be waived by the taxpayer after, as well as before, the expiration of the statutory period. McDonnell v. United
States, 288 U.S. 420; Stange v. United States, 282 U.S.
270; Brown & Sons Lumber Co. v. Burnet, 282 U.S.
283, 287; Burnet v. Railway Equipment Co., 282 U.S.
295, 298.
To avoid this conclusion here, respondent relies on
§ 1106 (a) of the Act of 1926, which provides that "The
bar of the statute of limitations against the United States
in respect of any internal-revenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability; . . ."

This section, it is said, indicates a Congres-

sional intent that, once the liability of the taxpayer is
extinguished, it should not be revived by waiver. The
government argues that this attempted distinction between the defense of the bar of the statute of limitations
and the defense that the liability has been extinguished is,
at most, only formal and does not affect the application
of § 278 (c); that a defense founded on a right which may

be waived by failure to plead it may likewise be waived
by formal document authorized by statute. Burnet v.
Desmornes, 226 U.S. 145; see Atlantic Coast Line v. Burnette, 239 U.S. 199, 200; Finn v. United States, 123,U.S.
227; 233; compare Stange v. United States, supra. 'But
doubts as to the effect which Congress intended, if any,
to be given to the quoted provision of § 1106 (a) in construing § 278 (c)' were removed by § 612 of the Revenue
Act of 1928, which declared that § 1106 (a) was repealed
as of February 26, 1926, its effective date. Congress thus
indicated its intention that the section should be erased
from the books as though it had never been enacted, so
that § 278, like other surviving sections of the 1926 Act,
'The legislative history of § 1106 (a) shows that its purpose was
not to prevent a taxpayer from voluntarily agreeing to pay a tax
after the period of limitation had expired. It was proposed in order
to avoid the effect of a decision of the Court of Claims in Toxaway
Mills v. United States, 61 Ct. Cls. 363, 372, holding that if a tax had
been collected after the running of the statute of limitations the
taxpayer could not set up that fact as entitling him to recover, but
could establish a right to a refund only by proving that there had

been an overpayment of the tax, on the theory that the statute of
limitations did not extinguish the liability but merely barred the
remedy. As stated in the Conference Report on this section of the
bill, H.Rep. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 55:
"This amendment is deemed advisable because of an opinion in a
recent decision of the Court of Claims, Toxaway Mills v. United
States .

.

. Obviously this section does not apply in the case of fraud

or in the case of a waiver."
And see 67 Cong. Rec., Part IV, p. 3531. But in conference § 1106
(a) was qualified by the addition of a clause denying a right to a
refund unless taxpayers had in fact overpaid the tax. See Conference
Rep., H.Rep. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 26, 55. Congress, in
enacting these provisions, was thus concerned with refunds rather
than assessments and obviously did not enact the provision for the
purpose of rendering invalid waivers executed after the running of
the statute. See also Sen. Rep. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 41;
Report of Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, 70th
Cong., 1st Sess., House Doe. No. 139, p. 16.

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

must be construed free of such restrictive influence, if
any, as § 1106 (a) would otherwise impose. Thus it must
be dealt with as was the identical section in the Act of
1924 which was before the Court in Stange v. United
States, supra.'
'It is true that § 506 (a) of the Act of 1928 amended § 278 (c)
of the Act of 1926 by providing for extension, by consent, of the time
within which an assessment might be made only if the consent were
given before the expiration of the period of limitation. But § 506 (b)
further provided that any such consent, given after the expiration
of the period of limitation, should be valid and effective according to
its terms if entered into after the enactment of the Act of 1928 and
before January 1, 1929. It was also provided, in § 506 (c), that
"The amendments made by this section to the Revenue Act of 1926
shall not be construed as in any manner affecting the validity of
waivers made prior to the enactment of this Act, which shall be
determined in accordance with the law in existence at the time such
waiver was filed." The application of subdivision (c) of § 506 is by
its terms limited to amendments made by the section and it seems
plain that it wa. intended to be a qualification of subdivision (a)
and not a limitation upon § 612. Compare United States v. Morrow,
266 U.S. 531. Thus construed it prevents any retroactive operation
of subdivision (a) by saying the effect of waivers already given
although after the expiration of the period of limitation. That effect
is to be determined by the application of the provisions of the Act
of 1926, with § 1106 (a) eliminated as provided by § 612 of the Act of
1928. The declared purpose of § 506 was to preserve the Commissioner's rights to waivers filed under prior acts and to fix January 1,
1929, as the date of change from the old practice to the new. See
H.Rep. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29; Sen. Rep. 960, 70th Cong.,
1st Sess., p. 36; Conference Rep., H.Rep. 1882, 70th Cong., 1st Sess.,
p. 21. If subdivision (c) were construed as a limitation upon § 612
it would nullify the operation of § 612, and would produce a "whim-,
sical result." See Commissioner v. Oswego & Syracuse R. Co., 62 F.
(2d) 518, 520. For waivers executed after the period of limitation
had run would be valid if filed prior to February 26, 1926, the effective date of the 1926 Act. Like waivers would be invalid if executed
between February 26, 1926, and May 29, 1928, the effective date of
the 1928 Act. But by § 506 (b), supra, they would be valid if executed between May 29, 1928 and January 1, 1929. Scope is given for
the operation of § 612, see Bernier v. Bernier, 147 U.S. 242, 246, and

Syllabus.

That Congress, with consent of the taxpayer, has power
to reinstate his tax liability and to authorize assessment
of the tax cannot be doubted. Graham& Fosterv. Goodcell, 282 U.S. 409, 426; Mascot Oil Co. v. United States,
282 U.S. 434. The taxpayer cannot complain that Congress has availed itself of the consent which he has given,
and cannot object that it did so by revival of the tax "liability," rather than by removing the bar of the statute as
in McDonnell v. United States, supra, and Stange v.
United States, supra; see Wm. Danzer & Co. v. Gulf &
S. I. R. Co., 268 U.S. 633, 636; Home Insurance Co. v.
Dick, 281 U.S. 397, 409.
We have considered, but do not discuss respondent's
arguments based on the construction of the waiver of
November 6, 1926, which are without merit. We do not
doubt that rightly construed the waiver conformed to the
requirements of §§ 278 and 280 of the Act of 1926, and
that by it respondent consented to the deficiency
assessment.

1. A death resulting from sunstroke, the insured having under normal
conditions voluntarily exposed himself to the sun while playing
golf, is not within the meaning of a policy insuring against death
effected solely by external and accidental means. P. 495.
2. That an injury was accidental in the understanding of the average
man-that the result was something unforeseen or extraordinaryincongruous results are avoided by treating § 1106 ,(a) as though it
had never been a part of the 1926 Act, as § 612 directs. See United
States v. Katz, 271 U.S. 354.
