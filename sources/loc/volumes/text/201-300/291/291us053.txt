the petitioner in No. 129 (ante, p. 35) only in the respect
that she has a vested remainder, subject, in certain events,
to be divested in favor of Harvard College. The Court of
Appeals did not make that circumstance the basis of any
distinction between her case and that of Freuler (No. 129).
The petitioner therefore makes the same contentions
which are there considered; but claims also, if her interest
in the trust corpus by way of remainder is given effect, it
does not follow that an affirmance in No. 129 requires the
like result in her case. As we reverse the judgment in
No. 129 and the reasons given in our opinion apply in this
case, we have no occasion to pass upon the added feature
presented by the remainder interest of the petitioner.
For the reasons set forth in the opinion in No. 129 the
judgment must be reversed.

for several years, asks that the amount overpaid be credited against
an unpaid tax, the collection of which has not yet been barred by
time, he, in effect, requests the taxing authorities to postpone the
collection of that tax until the claim has been acted on, during (at
least) the statutory period for assessment of the latest tax involved
of other beneficiaries of the same trust, under like circumstances, were
brought up by certiorari. They are Nos. 146 to 150,-- inclusive., By
stipulation filed in this court, the.parties agree that if the judgment
in No. 145 is reversed a like judgment shall be entered in the other
cases; and if that judgment is' affirmed a like judgment shall be
entered in the others.
