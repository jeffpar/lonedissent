MIGUEL v. McCARL, COMPTROLLER GENERAL,
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 435. Argued February 14, 15, 1934.-Decided March 5, 1934.
1. Where the duty to make a payment of public money is imposed so
plainly by statute as to leave no play for judgment or discretion,
the duty is purely ministerial and its performance may be
compelled by mandamus or mandatory injunction. P. 451.
2. A native of the Philippine Islands who enlisted under the Act of
February 2, 1901, "for service in the Army" as a Philippine
Scout, became "an enlisted man in the Army" within the meaning
of the Act of March 2, 1907, and, after having served 30 years, was
eligible under the latter Act to be placed upon the retired list, with
the pay and allowances therein prescribed. P. 452.
3. Provisions in later Acts cited in the opinion deal with the status of
officers of the Philippine Scouts, but not enlisted men, and cast no
doubt upon this right of the latter. P. 453.
4. A duty to pay, plainly imposed by the statutes, can not be
affected by a contrary decision of the Comptroller General. P. 454.
5. The Chief of Finance of the Army being charged by law with the
duty of disbursing all the funds of the War Department, including
the pay of -the Army, is the proper party defendant to a suit for
a mandatory injunction brought by a retired enlisted man to
enforce payment of retired pay and allowances. P. 455.
0. The disbursing officer to whom the voucher was presented, being
a subordinate of the Chief of Finance, is not an indispensable party
to such suit. Id.
7. The United States is not a necessary party to such a suit. Id.
8. It is not a ground for dismissing such a suit that recovery of the
pay may be had in the Court of Claims. Id.
9. In granting relief by injunction requiring the Chief of Finance of
the Army to satisfy claims for retired military pay and allowances,
as to which the Comptroller General upon request under 31 U.S.C.
(Supp.) § 74 had rendered an advance decision which was adverse
to payment, held unnecessary to require the Comptroller General
to recall the decision or to return the voucher. P. 455.
62 App.D.C. 259; 66 F. (2d) 564, reversed in part.

290 U.S. 618, to review the reversal of a

decree commanding the Chief of Finance of the Army to
satisfy claims of the plaintiff for retired military pay and
allowances; enjoining the Comptroller General from interfering, and requiring him to return from his files to a
disbursing officer a voucher upon which he had rendered
an adverse advance decision.
Mr. Samuel T. Ansell, with whom Mr. George M.
Wilmeth was on the brief, for petitioner.
The Comptroller General had no jurisdiction to review the order of the President, acting through the Secretary of War, placing petitioner on the enlisted men's
retired list of the Army with pay.
The Comptroller General was not required by law,
when applied to by a disbursing officer, to decide the
question of petitioner's right to retired pay notwithstanding the action of the President placing him on the
retired list with pay.
The decision of the Comptroller General was not based
on statutes of uncertain meaning. The status of petitioner was not doubtful under the applicable statutes
and his right to mandamus was clear.
The Court of Appeals erred in holding by implication
that no appropriation was available from which the retired pay could be paid to petitioner and that this was
a question solely for the determination of the Comptroller General.
Mr. Harrell 0. Hoagland,with whom Mr. R. L. Golz6
was on the brief, for McCarl, Comptroller General, respondent.
What primarily is brought in question by the petitioner
is the constitutional control (Art. I, § 9, cl. 7) by the
legislative branch over the uses of public moneys, as maintained through the appropriation acts and the duly con-

stituted accounting officers. The form of the proceeding
has for its object the frustration of such legislative control
by coercing a subordinate administrative official to make
payment on a disputed claim against the United States
under a general appropriation not conceded to be available for such purpose, as contrasted with the procedure
which has been authorized by Congress under the Tucker
Act of a suit on the merits in the Court of Claims, in
which any judgment obtained by the petitioner would be
for submission to the legislative branch for an appropriation, payment thereunder to be made on settlement by the
General Accounting Office.
The decision of the Comptroller General followed a
practice which the government accounting officers have
followed without interruption, at least since the Act of
March 30, 1868, 15 Stat. 54, to decide every question of
law and of fact necessary to be decided in determining
whether payment on a claim is authorized under existing
appropriations. Only in rare cases has Congress by specific language, plainly expressing its purpose, made the
decision of some other official conclusive on the question
whether payment is authorized.
The ruling of the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia in the present case, in failing to recognize that
it was the statutory official duty of the Comptroller General to decide the question of petitioner's right to pay,
was in conflict with the precedents of that court. Likewise it was in conflict with the decisions of the Court of
Appeals of the District, holding that the duty of the
Comptroller General to decide for the executive branch
of the Government whether payment on a claim against
the United States is authorized involves judgment and
discretion which will not be controlled by mandamus or
injunction. U.S. ex rel. Margulies & Sons v. McCarl, 10

The United States is bound by a decision of the Comptroller allowing active pay or retired pay to those claiming as officers or employees of the United States, whereas
the claimants' substantive legal rights are not affected
but they are left free to proceed against the United
States in the Court of Claims to have their rights judicially
decided, St. Louis, B. & M. Ry. Co. v. United States, 268
U.S. 169, 173-174; U.S. ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corp. v.
McCarl, 275 U.S. 1. This makes it even more clear why
the courts have declared the Comptroller General may not
be directed by mandamus or injunction to decide a claim
in a particular way. See McElrath v. United States, 102
U.S. 426; Geddes v. United States, 38 Ct. Cls. 428; Mullett v. United States, 21 Ct. Cls. 485; Longwill v. United

The record does not present any facts establishing it
to be the plain legal duty of the Chief of Finance, an
unbonded subordinate in the War Department, to pay,
or to cause any bonded disbursing officer to pay, retired
pay and allowances to petitioner.
A decree in accordance with the prayers of the petitioner's bill would be contrary to law.

The decision of the Comptroller General upon the allowance of accounts within his jurisdiction is conclusive
upon the executive branch of the Government. Act of
July 31, 1894, § 8, 28 Stat. 162, 207, following the provisions of the earlier Act of March 30, 1868, 15 Stat. 54;

Such a decision is required to be rendered "without
direction from any officer." Act of June 10, 1921, § 304,
42 Stat. 24; 31 U.S.C., § 44.
No court may direct the decision of the Comptroller
General to be rendered in a particular way. James Howden & Co. v. Standard Shipbuilding Corp., 17 F. (2d)

June 5, 1933, Dist. Ct. U.S., Nor. Dist. of Ohio, W.Div.,
refusing an order in the nature of a mandamus to the
Comptroller General.
A decree in accordance with the prayers of the petitiomner's bill would be contrary also to § 267 of the Judicial Code. Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U.S. 95, 104.
Reservation in decisions by the Comptroller General
of doubtful questions, for judicial decision in direct proceedings under the Tucker Act, does not prejudice the
claimants. See, e.g., Williams v. U.S., 289 U.S. 553; St.
Louis, B. & M. Ry. Co. v. United States, 268 U.S. 169,

operate, however, to protect the interests of the United
States and the authority of the legislative branch over
the public moneys; Mullett v. United States, 21 Ct. Cis.

Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Messrs. Erwin N.
Griswold, of the Department of Justice, and Archibald
King, of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the
War Department, were on the brief, argued that the judgment should be reversed.
The Philippine Scouts are a part of the regular Army.
The petitioner enlisted for service in the Army. Not
only is this plain from the express terms of the statuteunder which he enlisted, but it has also been recognized
by Congress in the appropriation acts. The practice under these statutes has also been uniform.
It seems impossible therefore to say that there is any
substantial basis for contending that the Philippine
Scouts are not members of the Army. If it may fairly
be regarded as plain that petitioner, as a Philippine Scout,
is a member of the Army, then there can be no doubt
of the authority of the Secretary of War to retire him.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

The determination of the War Department as to petitioner's eligibility to retirement was not subject to reexamination by the Comptroller General.
The act of the Secretary of War retiring the petitioner with pay was an exercise of the President's jurisdiction in a matter committed to him by the Constitution and by the statutes, and was, we submit, binding
and conclusive. The Comptroller General was without
power or jurisdiction to review and revise this act or to
make independent decision of the same questions of law
and of fact that were committed by the Constitution
and laws to the decision of the President through his
agents; and mere doubts as to the correctness of that
decision (if doubts can be said to exist) did not justify
refusal upon the Comptroller General's part to accord
it credit.
The Comptroller General's duty was purely ministerial and his refusal to follow the plain mandate of the
statute may be coerced in rhandamus or in equity. His
attempted exercise of discretion in a field in which he
had no discretion can not serve to shield him from those
remedies.
The contention that this suit must fail because petitioner has a remedy at law through a suit in the Court
of Claims is, we submit, not well taken. That a proceeding such as this may be maintained, although the claimant has a right of action in the Court of Claims, would
seem to be established by this Court's decision in Smith
v. Jackson, 246 U.S. 388. A similar result has been
reached in many other cases.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The petitioner served as an enlisted man in the Philippine Scouts under successive enlistments from October
1; 1901, until October 31, 1931, at which time, upon proper

MIGUEL v. McCARL.
442

Opinion of the Court.

application, he was, by order of the Secretary of War
acting for the President, placed on the retired list of the
army with the rank of master sergeant in pursuance of
the Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2515, 34 Stat. 1217, which
provides:
"When an enlisted man shall have served thirty years
either in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, or in all,
he shall, upon making application to the President, be
placed upon the retired list, with seventy-five per centum
of the pay and allowances he may then be in receipt
of, . ..
A voucher for the retired pay and allowances for the
month of November, 1931, was presented to the army
disbursing officer for Manila, who, without making payment, forwarded it to the Comptroller General through
the respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, with a request
for "an advance decision as to the legal authority for
payment." The Comptroller General, on January 19,
1932, rendered a decision holding that " the retirement of
enlisted men of the Philippine Scouts is not authorized
even by the remotest implication of the laws," and advising the disbursing officer that he was not authorized to
pay the voucher, which would be retained in.the files of
the office of the Comptroller General.
Petitioner thereupon brought this suit in the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia to enjoin the Comptroller General from interfering with the respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, or with any finance or disbursing
officer of the army, to prevent payment to petitioner of
the retired pay and allowances due for the month of November and subsequent months; and to enjoin and command the .Comptroller General to return forthwith to
the disbursing officer the voucher then being retained in
the files of his office. The bill further sought to enjoin
and command respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, to
pay -orcause to be paid to petitioner such retired pay and

allowances for November and subsequent months. Motions of respondents to dismiss the bill were denied by
,the supreme court of the District, and thereupon respondents filed separate answers. A motion to strike these
answers and for a decree in favor of petitioner was
granted by the supreme court of the District. Final decree against respondents followed in accordance with the
prayer of the bill.
Upon appeal to the court of appeals of the District, this
decree was reversed and the cause remanded to the supreme court of the District with instructions to dismiss
the bill. 62 App.D.C. 259; 66 F. (2d) 564. The holding
of that court rested upon the view that mandamus would
not lie against the Comptroller General to determine the
right of a retired member of the Philippine Scouts to
receive retirement pay and allowances, because the question of his status was disputed in good faith on the merits;
and that neither mandamus nor injunction should issue
"in a case of doubtful inference from statutes of uncertain meaning, for in such circumstances the duty sought
to be controlled is regarded as involving the character of
judgment or discretion."
No appearance is made here by respondent Coleman,
and no brief filed or argument made in his behalf. The
Solicitor General, however, has filed a comprehensive
brief (in which the Judge Advocate General of the War
Department joins) urging the correctness of the petitioner's coritention and uniting with him in challenging the
decision below. The Comptroller General, contending
that the decision is right and should be affirmed, states
the point of inquiry to be whether the Chief of Finance
and the Comptroller General can be compelled by mandatory injunction, the one to pay or cause to be paid the
voucher in qtiestion, and the other to approve and allow
credit for such payment, after the latter, on application
for a decision by the disbursing officer before whom the

MIGUEL v. McCARL.
442

Opinion of the Court.

voucher was pending for payment, has rendered his decision holding such payment not authorized under existing
appropriations.
The principal question upon which the case turns, and
the only one we need consider, is whether the statutes
involved so plainly require the payment of the voucher
that such payment constitutes a mere ministerial act on
the part of the disbursing officer. Following numerous
cases theretofore decided, the applicable rule in respect
of the writ of mandamus is stated in Wilbur v. United
States, 281 U.S. 206, 218-219, as follows:
"Mandamus is employed to compel the performance,
when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its chief
use. It also is employed to compel action, when refused,
in matters involving judgment and discretion, but not to
direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way nor to direct the retraction or reversal of action
already taken in the exercise of either.
"The duties of executive officers, such as the Secretary
of the Interior, usually are connected with the administration of statutes which must be read and in a sense construed to ascertain what is required. But it does not
follow that these administrative duties all involve judgment or discretion of the character intended by the rule
just stated. Where the duty in a particular situation is
so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt and equivalent to a positive command it is regarded as being so far
ministerial that its performance may be compelled by
mandamus, unless there be provision or implication to the
contrary. But where the duty is not thus plainly prescribed but depends upon a statute or statutes the construction or application of which is not free from doubt,
it is regarded as involving the character of judgment or
discretion which cannot be controlled by mandamus."
In Roberts v. United States, 176 U.S. 221, this court
held that where the proper construction of a statute is

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

clear, the duty of an officer called upon to act under it is
ministerial in its nature and may be compelled by mandamus. The opinion points out (p. 231) that every such
statute to some extent requires construction by the officer;
that he must read the law and, therefore, in a certain
sense, construe it in order to form a judgment from its
language what duty he is required to perform. "But that
does not necessarily and in all cases make the duty of the
officer anything other than a purely ministerial one. If
the law direct him to perform an act in regard to which no
discretion is committed to him, and which, upon the facts
existing, he is bound to perform, then that act is ministerial, although depending upon a statute which requires,
in some degree, a construction of its language by the officer. Unless this be so, the value of this writ is very
greatly impaired." This view of the matter has been uniformly approved in subsequent decisions. See, for example, Lane v. Hoglund, 244 U.S. 174, 181; Wilbur v. Krushnic, 280 U.S. 306, 318. The mandatory injunction here
prayed for is in effect equivalent to a writ of mandamus,
and governed by like considerations. Warner Valley
Stock Co. v. Smith, 165 U.S. 28, 31, 33. With the foregoing well settled rule in mind we turn to the pertinent
legislation.
Section 36 of the Act of February 2, .1901, c. 192, 31
Stat. 748, 757 authorizes the President, when in his opinion conditions in the Philippine Islands justify such action, "to enlist natives of those islands for service in the
Army, to be organized as scouts, with such officers as he
shall deem necessary for their proper control, or as troops
or companies, as authorized by this Act, for the Regular
Army."
Petitioner enlisted under this act, and it does not admit of doubt that thereby he enlisted "for service in the
Army" as a member of the organization of Philippine
Scouts. One who enlists for service in the army certainly

MIGUEL v. McCARL.

Opinion of the Court.

becomes "an enlisted man . .. in the Army "; and when

he " shall have served thirty years" therein, he falls within
the plain terms of the Act of March 2, 1907, supra, and,
in accordance therewith, is entitled to "be placed upon the
rotired list " with the pay and allowances therein prescribed. Statutory provisions so clear and precise do not
require construction. In such case, as this court has
often held, the language is conclusive. " There can be no
construction where there is nothing to construe." United
States v. Shreveport Grain Co., 287 U.S. 77, 83, and cases
cited.
The court below cites § 26 of the National Defense Act
of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, 185; §§ 22 and 26 of the Act
of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 759, 770, 775; and § 17 of the
Act of June 10, 1922, 42 Stat. 625, 632, in support of its
view that this is a case of "doubtful inference from statutes of uncertain meaning" in the sense of the rule stated
in Wilbur v. United States, supra, hereinbefore quoted.
But those sections fail, in our opinion, to disclose'anything which conflicts with the positive words of § 36 of
the Act of 1901, supra. Section 26 of the 1916 act simply
provides that captains and lieutenants of the Philippine
Scouts who are citizens of the United States shall be entitled to retirement under the laws governing retirement
of enlisted men of the regular army, but to be retired with
the grade held by them at the date of their retirement.
The section is confined to the officers named and has
nothing to do with enlisted men. The provision was
necessary, as pointed out in the brief of the Solicitor General, because prior to the enactment of the Act of June 4,
1920, supra, these officers were usually enlisted men of
other branches of the regular army, whose appointments
were of a provisional character. Special legislation was
therefore required to enable them to retire with the pay
and allowances of officers instead of enlisted men. The
provisions in the Act of June 4, 1920, which are referred

454

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

to, relate to "all officers of the Philippine Scouts," but it
is expressly provided that nothing in the act shall alter
the status of enlisted men. Section 17 of the Act of June
10, 1922, likewise relates to officers and former officers
of the Philippine Scouts, according them the status of
officers in the regular establishment; and again it is provided that the act shall not be construed as affecting the
enlisted men.
It is hard to see how it reasonably can be thought that
these acts have any effect upon the status of the enlisted
men, since they are limited, in express terms, to officers.
They do not modify or purport to modify in any way the
provisions of § 36 of the Act of 1901 in respect of such
enlisted men. If that conclusion were not clear, the provisos would effectually settle the doubt. Putting aside
those acts, therefore, as irrelevant, we have only to consider § 36 of the Act of 1901, which plainly'establishes
the status of petitioner as an enlisted man in the army,
and the Act of March 2, 1907, which just as plainly directs
that such an enlisted man, having served thirty years as
such, shall be placed upon the retired list.. In this situation the duty of the disbursing officer to pay the voucher
in question "is so plainly prescribed as to be free from
doubt and equivalent to a positive command," and, therefore, is "so far ministerial that its performance may be
compelled by mandamus." Wilbur v. United States,
supra,pp. 218-219. It seems unnecessary to add that this
duty cannot be affected by a contrary decision of the
Comptroller General.
It is said by the Comptroller General that there was no
existing appropriation of public money available for payment of retired pay and allowances to petitioner. But
this statement quite evidently is made only in the view
that the petitioner does not come within the retirement
provision of the Act of March 2, 1907, since there was

MIGUEL v. McCARL.
442

Opinion of the Court.

available an existing appropriation for retired pay and
allowances of enlisted men retired under that provision.
The Chief of Finance is charged by law with the duty
of disbursing all funds of the War Department, including
the pay of the army. U.S.C., Title 10, § 172. The disbursing officer to whom the voucher wvas presented for
payment, therefore, is simply a subordinate of the Chief
of Finance, subject to his control and direction, and the
suit was properly brought against the latter. The purpose of the suit was to control the action of the Chief of
Finance, that is, to compel him to pay or cause to be paid
the voucher in question. The disbursing officer as the
mere agent of his superior officer is not an indispensable,
although he might have been joined as a proper, party.
Compare Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, supra, pp.
34-35; Gnerich v. Rutter, 265 U.S. 388, 391-393; Webster
v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507; Alcohol Warehouse Corp. v. Canfield, 11 F. (2d) 214; Dami v. Canfield, 5 F. (2d) 533.
We find no merit in the contention that the United States
is a necessary party and this suit not maintainable without its consent, Payne v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., 255 U.S.
228, 238; or in the further contention that the suit cannot be maintained because petitioner has a remedy at
law in the court of claims for his retired pay. Smith v.
Jackson, 246 U.S. 388; 241 Fed. 747, 760.
It follows that the decree of the court below, in so far
as it directs a dismissal of the bill as against the respondent Coleman, must be reversed, and the decree of the
supreme court of the District in respect of that respondent
affirmed.
As to the Comptroller General, a different situation is
presented. "The request for an advance decision from
him came from the Chief of Finance at the request of
the disbursing officer. U.S.C. (Supp.), Title 31, § 74.
The Comptroller General undertook nothing on his own

motion, and, as he asserts, did nothing either to coerce
or invite the application for an advance decision. Having
given that decision, his function in that regard ceased.
The effect of the decision is a matter purely of law. Obviously, there is no occasion for compelling him by mandamus to recall his decision. However, he continues to
retain possession of the voucher, upon the theory evidently
that, having determined that the disbursing officers were
without authority to make payment, it belongs in the
files of his office. The view of the supreme court of the
District, that a mandatory injunction will lie to compel a
return of that voucher to the disbursing officer and to enjoin the Comptroller General from any interference with
the Chief of Finance tending to prevent payment thereof
to petitioner, has not, in the light of the case as now made,
met with the concurrence of a majority of this court. In
that situation, we, therefore, affirm, without discussion,
the decree of the District court of appeals in so far as
it relates to the Comptroller General. But it is not to
be supposed that, upon having his attention called to our
decision, the Comptroller General will care to retain possession of the voucher or that he will interfere in any
way with its payment.
The decree of the court below will accordingly be reversed as to -the respondent Coleman, and affirmed as to
the Comptroller General. But, in accordance with precedent, Wilbur v. Krushnic, supra, p. 319, the mandatory
injunction to Coleman should issue directing a disposal
of petitioner's application for pay upon the merits, unaffected by the opinion of the Comltroller General, and
in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion
as to the proper interpretation and application of the
pertinent statutes. A writ in that form is better suited
to the circumstances than that indicated by the supreme
court of the District.
Reversed in part.
Affirmed in part.
