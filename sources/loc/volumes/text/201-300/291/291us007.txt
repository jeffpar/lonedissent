WOLFLE v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 338. Argued December 12, 1933.-Decided January 8, 1934.
1. In the absence of congressional legislation on the subject, the admissibility of testimony in the federal courts in criminal causes, is
governed by common law principles, as interpreted and applied by
those courts in the light of reason and experience. Funk v. United
States, 290 U.S. 371. P. 12.
2. The basis of the rule of evidehce excluding proof of confidential
communications between husband and wife, is the protection of the
marriage relation. P. 14..
3. As the privilege suppresses relevant testimony, it should be allowed
only where it is plain that marital confidence can not otherwise be
reasonably preserved. Pp. 14, 17.
4. A confidential communication by husband to wife through the
medium of his stenographer, held admissible, upon proof of it by
the stenographer testifying from the stenographic notes. P. 16.

CERTIORARI,

Mr. George E. Flood, with whom Messrs. S. J. Wettrick
and H. Sylvester Garvin were on the brief, for petitioner.
The state statute preserves the common-law privilege of
communications from husband to wife.
In courts of the United States the common law rule
governs. Connecticut Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 94 U.S.
457; Liggett v. Glenn, 51 Fed. 381; Rosen v. United
States, 245 U.S. 467.
There is a conflict in the decisions as to the admissibility of privileged communications where testimony thereof
is procured from witnesses other than husband or wife,
attorney and client, or physician and patient. This turns

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Petitioner.

291 U.S.

upon whether the particular court adopts one or the other
of two tests: First, that if the communication originates
in confidence and under circumstances intended to be
privileged, and if the privilege is not consciously surrendered, the privilege will be enforced and the communication excluded; or, second, that regardless of the privileged origin and confidential nature, admissibility is purely
a matter of custody of the communication; if it has been
filched by any means, surreptitious or otherwise, the communication will be admitted. The first line of cases seek
to consult the nature and the purpose of the communication and to carry out the policy of the principle. The
second line of cases disregard the purpose and the policy
and erroneously treat the privilege as if it were in derogation of the common law, seizing upon any circumstance,
however slight, in order to defeat the privilege.
Among the cases repudiating this false doctrine are:
Gross v. State, 61 Tex. Cr. Rep. 470; Liggett v. Glenn, 51
Fed. 381; Mercer v. State, 40 Fla. 716; Scott v. Commonwealth, 94.Ky. 511; Henderson v. Chaires, 25 Fla. 26;
Selden v. State, 74 Wis. 271; Wilkerson v. State, 91 Ga.

The privilege extends not only to the attorney, but to
the attorney's secretary, stenographers or clerks. Taylor,

strictly, as in derogation of the common law, but very
uniformly include within the privilege not only the

physician's nurse, technician or X-ray specialist, or a communication made by the patient to the physician in the
presence of any of the physician's necessary assistants.

Under the great weight of authority today, the dictation
of libelous statements to a stenographer, or the delivery of
a written libelous communication -to a stenographer, clerk,
typist, or agent, do not constitute delivery or publication
and are deemed privileged. This was not always the case.
It is a modern growth and development in the law. See

The law applicable in determining the question of
privilege is the law of Washington at the time Washington was admitted into the Union as a State.
Petitioner's stenographer was competent to testify as
to the contents of the letter in question. Code of Washington Territory, 1881, § 392; Remington's Rev. Stats.,

That the third person rule applies regardless of the
intimacy of the relation between the person who acquires
knowledge of a communication between a husband and

ample demonstration in the cases. Hopkins v. Grimshaw,

Those decisions relied upon by petitioner which hold
that a business man or merchant does not publish a libelous statement simply by dictating it to a stenographer
are not in point. Their ratio decidendi was clearly explained in Osborn v. Boulter (C.A. 1930), 2 K.B. 226,
236.
MR. JusTIcE STONE delivered the- opinion of the Court.
This case comes here on certiorari to review a ruling
of the District Court for Western Washington in a criminal trial, admitting in evidence against the accused, the
petitioner here, a statement contained in a letter written
by him to his wife, but proved by the testimony of a
stenographer, readingfrom her notes, to whom petitioner
,had dictated the letter and who had transcribed it. The
ruling was upheld and the conviction, sustained by the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 64 F. (2d) 566,
which adopted as the test of admissibility of the evidence
its interpretation of the statute in force in the territory of
Washipgton at the time of its admission to statehood.
§ 392, Code of Washington, 1881; see State v. Nelson,
39' Wash. 221; 81 Pac. 721; State v. Rasmussen, 125
Wash. 176; 215 Pac. 332.
During the present term this Court has resolved conflicting views expressed in its earlier opinions by holding that
the rules governing the competence of witnesses in criminal trials in the federal courts are not necessarily restricted
to those local rules in force at the time of the admission
into the Union of the pprticular state where the trial takes
place, but are governed by common law principles as
interpreted and applied by the federal courts in the light
of reason and experience. Funk v. United, States, 290
U.S. 371. If any different rule with respect to the admissibility of testimony has been thought to apply in the
federal courts, Wigmore on Evidence, 2d ed., § 6; compare
Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687,, it is clear that it

Opinion of the Court.

should be the same as that governing the competence of
witnesses. So our decision here, in the absence of Congressional legislation on the subject, is to be controlled by
common law principles, not by local statute.
The statement to which the witness was permitted to
testify in the present case was a relevant admission. by
petitioner, probative of his guilty purpose or intent to.
commit the crime charged. It was therefore rightly received in 'evidence unless it should have been excluded
because made in a communication to his wife.
The government insists that confidential communications between husband and wife are privileged only when
the testimony offered is that of one of the spouses, and
that the privilege does not exclude proof of communications between them, however confidentii1,.by a witness
who is neither the husband nor the wife. The question
thus raised remains open in the federal courts.' But we
1 Mr. Justice Miller, sitting as Circuit Justice, excluded evidence of
confidential communications in a letter written by the husband to his
wife, found by the latter's administrator among'her papers, although
proved by a third party witness. Bowman v. Patrick, 32 Fed. 368;
cf. Lloyd v. Pennie, .50 Fed. 4. A like decision was reached'by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in New York Life Ins.
Co. v. Ross, 30 F. (2d) 80. The. Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit made the same ruling with respect to a communication between an attorney and client in Liggett v. Glenn, 51 Fed. 381, and A
district court reached a similar conclusion with respect to communications between physician and patient in Dreier v. Continental Life
Ins. Co., 24 Fed. 670. Compare a dictum in Hopkins v. Grimshaw,
165 U.S. 342, 351. It seems that many state courts rule that a communication between husband and wife, however confidential, may be
proved by the testimony of a third person who has acquired knowledge of it, even though without the assent of the spouse making the
communication, at least where the spouse to whom the communication was made is not responsible for the disclosure. Hammons v.
State, 73 'Ark. 495; 84 S.W. 718; Wilkerson v. "State,91 Ga. 729;
17 S.E. 990; O'Toole v. Ohio German Fire Ins. Co., 159 Mich. 187;

find it unnecessary to answer it here, for in the view we
take the challenged testimony to the communication by
the husband to his wife is not within the privilege because
of the voluntary disclosure by him to a third person, his
stenographer.
The basis of the immunity given to communications between husband and wife is the protection of marital confidences, regarded as so essential to the preservation of,
the marriage relationship as to outweigh the disadvantages to the administration of justice which the privilege entails. See Hammons v. State, 73 Ark. 495, 500;
84 S.W. 718; Sexton v. Sexton, 129 Iowa 487, 489, if;
105 N.W. 314; O'Toole v. Ohio German Fire Ins. Co.,
159 Mich, 187, 192; 123 N.W. 795; Wigmore on Evidence,
2d ed., § 2336. 'Hence it is that the privilege with respect
to communications extends to the testimony of husband
or wife even though the different privilege, excluding the
testimony of one against the other, is not involved. See
Gordon, Rahkin & Co. v. Tweedy, 71 Ala. 202, 210;
Wickes v. Wal~len, 228 Ill. 56; 81 N.E. 798; Southwick v.
Southwick, 49 N.Y. 510, 519; Wigmore on Evidence, 2d
ed., §§ 2227, 2228, 2332, 2333.
Communications between the spouises, privately made,
are generally assumed to have been intended to be confidential, and'hence they are privileged; but wherever a
communication, because of its nature or the circumstances under which it was made, was obviously hot intended to be confidential it is not a privileged communication. See Caldwell v. State, 146 Ala. 141, 143; 41 So.
473; Parkhurstv. Berdell, 110 N.Y. 386, 393; 18 N.E. 123;
Truelsch v. Miller, 186 Wis. 239, 249; 202 N.W. 352.
And, when made in the presence of a third party, such
communications are usually regarded as not privileged
because not made in confidence. Jacobs v. United States,
161 Fed. 694; Cocroft v. Cocroft, 158 Ga. 714; 124 S.E.

WOLFLE v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

346; cf. Linnell v. Linnell, 249 Mass. 51, 143 N.E. 813,
with Freeman v. Freeman, 238 Mass. 150; 130 N.E. 220.
Here it is suggested that the voluntary disclosure to the
stenographer negatives the confidential character of the
communication. Cf. State v. Young, 97 N.J.L. 501; 117
Atl. 713. But we do not think the question which we have
to determine is one.of fact whether the petitioner's letter
to his wife was intended to be confidential. We may take
it that communications between.husband and wife may
sometimes be made in confidence even though in the presence of a third person, see.Robin v. King, 2 Leigh (Va.)
140, 144; and that would seem especially to be the case
where the communication is made in the presence of or
through the aid of a private secrefary or stenographer
whose duties, in common experience, are confidential. Cf.
Edmondson v. Birch & Co., [1907] 1 K.B. 371, 382. Accordingly the question with which we are now concerned
is the extent to which the privilege which the law concedes to communications made confidentially between
the husband and wife embraces the transmission of them,
likewise iM confidence, through a third party intermediary, communications with whom are not themselves
protected by any privilege. Cf. Drew v. Drew, 250 Mass.
41; 144 N.E.. 763.
Petitioner invokes the authority of those cases where
the privilege. granted to communications between attorney
and client has been held to exclude proof of the communication by the testimony of -a clerk present when it was
made, see Sibley v. Waffle, 16 N.Y. 180, 183; Wartell v.
Novograd, 48 R.I. 296, 301; 137 .Atl. 776; Taylor v.
Forster,2 C. & P. 195; cf. State v. Brown, 2 Mary. (Del.)
380, 397; 36 Atl. 458, and of those where the statutory
privilege extended to the information gained by a physician from consultation with his patient has been deemed
to exclude, by implication, proof of the condition of the

patient by testimony of a nurse who attended the consultation. See Culver v. Union Pacific R. Co., 112 Neb.
441, 450; 199 N.W. 794; cf. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Owen,
111 Ark. 554; 164 S.W. 720. It is said that the stenographer here similarly stood in a confidential relationship
tothe petitioner and that the communication to her of the
contents of petitioner's letter to his wife should, on
grounds both of reason and convenience, be protected by
the privilege which the law extends to confideintial communications privately made between husband and wife.
We may assume for present purposes that where it is
the policy-of the law to throw its protection around knowl-'
edge gained or statements made in confidence, it will find
a way to make that protection effective by bringing within
its scope the testimony of those whose participation in the
confidence is reasonably required. It may be that it
would be of little worth to forbid the disclosure of information gained by a physician from the examination or
consultation of his patient, if the nurse, necessarily present, could reveal it. See Culver v. Union Pacific R. Co.,
supra;Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Jordan, 164 Miss.
174; 143 So. 483. It may plausibly be urged that the
privilege of- attorney and client would be as often defeated as preserved if it did not draw within its sweep
the testimony of clerks in the lawyer's office. See Sibley
v. Waffle- supra.
But it is unnecessary now to determine the latitude
which may rightly be given to the privilege which the law
confers upon either of these relationships, for no considerations such as those suggested apply to marital communications under conditions disclosed here. Normally
husband and wife may conveniently communicate without
stenographic aid and the privilege of holding their confidences immune from proof in court may be reasonably
enjoyed and preserved without embracing within it, the

FEDERAL COMPRESS CO. v. McLEAN.

Syllabus.

testimony of third persons to whom such communications
have been voluntarily revealed. The uniform ruling that
communications between husband and wife, voluntarily
made in the presence of their children, old enough to comprehend them, or other members of the family within the
intimacy of the family circle, are not privileged, Linnell
v. Linnell, 249 Mass. 51; 143 N.E. 813; Cowser v. State,
70 Tex. Cr. Rep. 265;, 157 S.W. 758; Fullerv. Fuller, 100
W.Va. 309; 130 S.E. 270, is persuasive that communications like the present, even though made in confidence,
are not to be protected. The privilege suppresses relevant
testimony and should be allowed' only when it is plain
that marital confidence can not otherwise reasonably be
preserved. Nothing in this case suggests any such
necessity.
We do not intimate whether in the present circumstances the wife's testimony, not offered against her husband, would likewise be freed of the restriction. Cf. Nash
