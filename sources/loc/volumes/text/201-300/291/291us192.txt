Syllabus.

The Solicitor General says-" The question is identical
with that raised in Helvering v. Falk, No. 225, October
Term, 1933, and the argument made in the Government's
brief in that case is likewise applicable here. . . . There
is therefore substantially no difference between the position of the beneficiaries in this case and the Falk case."
The judgments below are affirmed upon authority of
Helvering v. Falk, decided this day, ante, p. 183.

MR. JUSTICE STONE, and MR.

JUSTICE CARDOZO think that these cases are to be distinguished from No. 225, Helvering v. Falk, just decided,
because of the nature 6f the duties imposed upon the
trustees, and of the remainder interest granted to the
beneficiaries by the trust instrument presently involved,
and accordingly concur in the result.

because of cancellations. Held:
