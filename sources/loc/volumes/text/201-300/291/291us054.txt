that she has a vested remainder, subject, in certain events,
to be divested in favor of Harvard College. The Court of
Appeals did not make that circumstance the basis of any
distinction between her case and that of Freuler (No. 129).
The petitioner therefore makes the same contentions
which are there considered; but claims also, if her interest
in the trust corpus by way of remainder is given effect, it
does not follow that an affirmance in No. 129 requires the
like result in her case. As we reverse the judgment in
No. 129 and the reasons given in our opinion apply in this

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 133. Argued December 5, 6, 1933.-Decided January 8,

1934.

1. When a taxpayer, in filing a claim for overpayment of income taxes

for several years, asks that the amount overpaid be credited against
an unpaid tax, the collection of which has not yet been barred by
time, he, in effect, requests the taxing authorities to postpone the
collection of that tax until the claim has been acted on, during (at
least) the statutory period for assessment of the latest tax involved
of other beneficiaries of the same trust, under like circumstances, were
brought up by certiorari. They are Nos. 146 to 150,-- inclusive., By
stipulation filed in this court, the.parties agree that if the judgment
in No. 145 is reversed a like judgment shall be entered in the other
cases; and if that judgment is' affirmed a like judgment shall be
entered in the others.

in. the claim; and where, within that period, the Commissioner has
found an overpayment and has applied it to the unpaid tax as
requested, the taxpayer is estopped from claiming the amount as
still due him upon the ground that collection of the unpaid tgx had
in the meantime been barred by limitation. P. 59.
So held where the practice of the collector's office was to treat
such a claim as a stay of collection of unpaid taxes against which
credit was asked, until the Commissioner had adjudged the claim;
and where the taxpayer had at first accepted without protest the
application of the credit and paid the resulting balance.
2. The provision of the Revenue Act of 1928 (§ 609) declaring that
a credit against any liability for any taxable year shall be void if
made against a liability barred by limitation, applies where the
credit is made by the Ccmmissioner in invitum, not where it is
done, as in this case, at the taxpayer's request. P. 60.
3. Under the provision of the Revenue Act of 1921, § 250 (d), that
no suit shall be begun after the expiration of five years succeeding
the filing of the return "unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment and
collection," any writing, formal or informal, is sufficient to show the
Commissioner's consent if his approval may be gathered from it as
a reasonable inference. P. 62.
4. A taxpayer suing for a refund upon the ground that the crediting
of the amount against an earlier tax took place after the collection
of that tax had become barred by limitation, has the burden of
producing evidence to show that a consent to extension of the collection period, filed by him, WVas not assented to in writing by the
Comnissioner. P. 62.
5. The word " waiver" written on an assessment list attached to a
certificate of assessment signed by the Commissioner, together with
a date indicative of the tax referred to, held evidence in this case
of the Commissioner's consent to a waiver filed by the taxpayer. P. 63.
6. Choice between two doubts as to which of two waivers was
intended by such entries, should be so made as to favor. the presumption of official regularity. P. 64.
7. Action to recover an overpayment of taxes, on the ground of illegal
assessment or collection, is barred by R.S., § 3226; 26 U.S.C., § 156,
on the expiration of five years from the time of payment. P. 64.
8. To constitute an account stated, a balance must have been struck

Barker were on the brief, for petitioner.

MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Upon the footing of an account stated the petitioner

Income and profits tax returns for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1917, were filed by the taxpayer in Septem'ber, 1917. The tax shown by these returns a well as by
amended returns for the same year was paid in full.
Income and profits tax returns for the fiscal year ending
July 31, 1918, were filed in October, 1918, and again the
tax was promptly paid.
Following the practice of the Bureau, the Commissioner
proceeded to audit the returns to the end that the assessments might be increased or reduced according to the
facts.
In February,. 1921, the taxpayer signed and filed a
waiver of any statutory period of limitation as to the
assessment and collection of the tax for the calendar year

1917. It did this in order to be assured that the audit
by the Commissioner would be deliberate and thorough.
In the absence of such a consent the period of limitation
would have expired in April, 1923. The extension was
approved in writing by the Commissioner in February,
1923. The waiver on its face had no limit in respect of
time, but under a regulation adopted iriApril, 1923, it
spent its force on April 1, 1924, unless continued or
renewed.
In February, 923, the taxpayer signed a second waiver
applicable to the fiscal years 1917 and 1918, and extending the period for collection until March 1, 1925. This
waiver was not signed by the Commissioner within the
term of its duration, though it was signed, years afterwards; on April 7, 1930. However, in June, 1923, while
both waivers were on file, the Commissioner made an
additional assessnent for the fiscal year ending July 31,
1917, and on the attached assessment list wrote the word
"waiver" opposite the item affecting the petitioner. The
additional assessment for 1917 was reduced by Lcredit of
an overassessment for 1916, and when so redu'-ed
amounted to $20,757.14. Payment of this amount was
demanded by the Collector on August 3, 1923.
On August 9, 1923, the .petiiioner filed a claim for refund and credit of income taxes alleged to have been
overpaid for the fiscal years 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1921,
amounting in the aggregate to $35,727.10, and asked that
the,unpaid balance for 1917 be set-off against the claim
for overpayment and that the remainder be refunded.
At that time it was the practice of tte Collector's office
to treat such a claim as a stay of collection. of unpaid
taxes against which the credit was asked, until the Commissioner had considered and adjusted the claim.
On March 1, 1924, the Commissioner approved a schedule of overassessments which included an overassessment
in favor of the petitioner for the fiscal year ending July

31, 1918, in the sum of $14,928.07, and sent this schedule
to the. Collector for action in accordance with the directions appearing thereon. On June 12, 1924, the Collector,
following these instructions, signed and returned the
schedule to the Commissioner, together with a schedule
of refunds and credits, certifying the application of $14,928.07 as a credit. On June 28, 1924, the Commissioner
signed the schedule of refunds and credits, by which act
for the first time he definitively announced his allowance
of the claim. Girard Trust Co. v. Unted States, 270
U.S. 163, 170; United States v. Swift & Co.,,282 U.S. 468,
475. 'Before doing this, and on or after March 1, 1924,
he had transmitted to the petitioner a certificate of overassessment for' the fiscal year ending July 31, 1918, in the
sum of $14,928.07, Ahich sum was credited in June upon
'the taxes 'overdue. This' overassessment for 1918, applied as a credit upon the unpaid tax for 1917 ($20,757.14), reduced the liability of the taxpayer to $5,829.07.
Demand for the payment of this balance with accrued
interest was made by the Collector on September 1, 1924.
Two weeks later, the petitioner complied with the demand,
accepting without protest the application, of the credit,
and paying the resulting balance.
For. nearly six years the transaction vas allowed to
stand unopened and unchallenged. In April, 1930, the
petitioner learned through an attorney that the second
waiver had not been signed by the Commissioner until
after it had expired. With this knowledge .it filed with
the Commissioner a claim for refund of the overpaid tax
for 1918 ($14,928.07) which had been collected through
application as a credit upon the tax for the year before.
.The basis for the claim was this, that at the time of. the
credit the first waiver had expired, that the second waiver
was ineffective because not signed ry the Commissioner,
that collection by credit after the term of limitation was
as much prohibited as collection at such a time by suit

or by distraint, and hence that the overpaid tax certified
by the Commissioner in the schedule of. overassessment
was an undischarged indebtedness, still owing from the
'Government. Four days later this action was begun.
The Court of Claims gave judgment in favor of the Government; 2 F.Supp. 773, and a writ of certiorari brings
the case here.
1. In auditing the tax for 1918 and crediting the overassessment for that year upon the tax for the year before,
the Commissioner acted at the request of the petitioner,
which was valid till revoked.
For the decision of this case we do not need to rule
whether a "waiver" by a taxpayer consenting to the
enlargement of the tim for assessment or collection is
ineffective unless approved by the Commissioner in writing.* There was here more than a waiver, an abandonment of a privilege to insist upon the fulfilment of a condition (Stange v. United States, 282 U.S. 270, 275, 276;
Florsheim Bros. Co.v. United States, 280 U.S. 453, 456);
there was a positive request, which till revoked upon reasonable notice had the effect of an estoppel.
On August 3, 1923, the Collector made demand upon
the petitioner for the payment of $20,757.14, the tax balance then due for the year 1917.. There is no dispute
that the demand was timely, and that collection would
have been enforced unless the taxpayer had done something to postpone the hour of payment. Waivers were
then on file, one of them signed by the Commissioner,
the other unsigned, but the petitioner did not rest upon
these, nor would these without more have availed to avert
the threatened levy. On August 9, 1923, the petitioner
filed with the Commissioner a request to withhold the

process of collection until credits were adjusted. In substance the request was this: Please do not collect the tax
for 1917, until you have completed the audit for the years
1918 to 1921 inclusive, and if there has been overassessment for those years, set it off as a credit.
Now, the time for assessment and collection of the 1921
tax did not expire till 1925, and this without the aid of any
waiver or extension. In such circumstances, request by
the taxpayer that the Commissioner withhold collection
for 1917 Until there d been an audit of the tax for 1921
was at least equivalent to a request that he delay until the
assessment for 192i was due under the statute. But
before that time arrived, i. e., before 1925, the Commissioner had acted. On March 1, 1924, he hail completed
the reaudit, and had discovered an overassessment for one
of the years covered by the petitioner's request. Within
a reasonable time thereafter (June 12, 1924) he had received from the Collector a report that $20,757.14 was
still unpaid upon the tax for 1917. Promptly thereafter
(June 28, 1924), he had complied with the petitioner's
instructions by offsetting the overpayment for the one
year in reduction of the balance owing for the other. The
whole process had been completed within the time fixed
by implication in the petitioner's request, within the time
when assessment was due for the last of the group of
years (1918 to 1921) to be covered by the audit.
The petitioner makes the point that by the Revenue
Act of 1928 (c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875, § 609), a credit
against a liability in respect of any taxable year shall be
"void" if it has been made against a liability barred by
limitation. The aim of that provision, as we view it, was
to invalidate such a credit if made by the Commissioner
of his own motion without the taxpayer's approval or with
an approval falling short of inducement or request. Cf.
Stange v. United States, supra; Revenue Act of 1928,
§ 506 (b) (c), c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 870, 871. If nothing

Opinion of the Court.

more than this appeared, there was to be no exercise in
invitum of governmental power. But the aim of the
statute suggests a restraint uponits meaning. To know
whether liability has been barred by limitation it will not
do to refer to the flight of time alone. The limitation
may have been postponed by force of a simple waiver,
which must then be made in adherence to the statutory
forms, or so we now assuipe.. It may have been postponed by deliberate persuasion to withhold official action.
We think it an unreasonable construction that would view
the prohibition of the statute as overriding the doctrine of
estoppel (Randon v. Toby, 11 How. 493, 519) and invalidating a credit made at the taxpayer's request. Here, at
the time of the request'fhe liability was still alive, unaffected as yet by any statutory bar. The request in its
fair meaning reached forward into the future and prayed
for the postponement of collection till the audits for later
years had been completed in the usual course. This having been done, the suspended collection might be effected
by credit or by distraint or by other methods prescribed
by law. Congress surely did not mean that a credit was
to be void if made by the Government in response to such
a prayer.
The applicable principle is fundamental and unquestioned. "He who prevents a thing from being done may
not avail himself of the non-performance which he has
himself occasioned, for the law says to him in effect 'this
is your own act, and therefore you are not damnified.'"
Dolan v. Rodgers, 149 N.Y. 489, 491; 44 N.E. 167; and
Imperator Realty Co. v. Tull, 228 N.Y. 447, 457; 127
N.E. 263; quoting West v. Blakeway, 2 Man. & G. 828,
839. Sometimes the resulting disability has been characterized as an estoppel, sometimes as a waiver. The label
counts for little. Enough for present purposes that the
disability has its roots in a principle more nearly ultimate
than either waiver or estoppel, the principle that no one

shall be permitted to found any claim upon his own
inequity or take advantage of his own wrong. Imperator

Zealand Shipping Co. v. Socit6 des Ateliers, [1919] A.C.
1, 6; Williston, Contracts, Vol. 2, §§ 689, 692.
2. If we assume in favor of the petitioner that the
credit is a nullity in the absence of a written waiver, approved by the Commissioner, the record supports the
inference that at the time of the set-off such approval
had been given.
The statute provides that no suit or proceeding shall
be begun for the collection of the tax after the expiration
of five years succeeding the filing of the return "unless
both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in
writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection." Revenue Act of 1921; c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265,
§ 250 (d). In this case, consent by the taxpayer in due
form is found and indeed conceded. The only question
is whether there was consent by the Commissioner. But
the statute does not say that the evidence of consent shall
be embodied in a single paper. Cf. Eclipse Lawn Mower
Co. v. United States, 1 F.Supp. 768. Its one requirement in respect of form is that the consent shall be i
writing. Sabin v. United States, 70 Ct. Cls. 574; 44 F.
(2d) 70. There is left a wide range of administrative discretion. Any writing, formal or informal, is sufficient
if made for the purpose of recording the Commissioner's
approval, and if approval may be gathered therefrom as a
reasonable inference.
The burden was on the petitioner, seeking a refund oi
its tax, toprove its allegation that the overassessment for
1918 had been illegally credited upon the tax for 1917.

STEARNS CO. v. UNITED STATES.
54,

Opinion of the Couit.

At the outset it might have stood upon the fact that the
credit had been made after the normal term of limitation,
casting the burden on the Government of going forward
with evidence in proof of an extension. When its own
waiver had been proved, however, the case took on another aspect. At that stage the presumption of official
regularity was sufficient to sustain the inference that the
Commissioner on his side had done whatever was appropriate to give support to his own act and thus validate
the credit. Acts done by a public officer "which presuppose the existence of other acts to make them legally
operative, are presumptive proofs of the latter." Bank
of the United States v. Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 64, 70;
United States v. Royer, 268 U.S. 394, 398; Knox County
v. Ninth National Bank, 147 U.S. 91, 97; Mandeville v.
Reynolds, 68 N.Y. 528, 534; Demings v. Supreme Lodge
Knights of Pythias, 131 N.Y. 522, 527; 30 N.E. 572; Wigmore, Evidence, Vol. 5, § 2524. No doubt the presumption of regularity is subject to be rebutted. It stands
until dislodged.
Now, the petitioner has failed to show that the Commissioner did not approve in writing. On the contrary the
evidence is persuasive that he did. A certificate of an
additional assessment for the fiscal year ending July 31,
1917, was signed, as we have seen, on June 26, 1923; and
on the assessment list attached thereto, opposite the entry
of the assessment against the petitioner, the following appears: "7/31/17 Fise. 1753361. O.L. 4/17/23; waiver."
The Commissioner did not sign his name below the memorandum, but the memorandum was attached to a certificate which the Commissioner did sign, and his name subscribed to the certificate authenticates also the documents
attached to it, if we assume in favor of the petitioner that
signing is essential. The Court of Claims was of the opinion that the word "waiver" on this list had relation to

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion 6f the Court.

291 U.S.

the second of the two consents on file with the Commissioner. The context and the circumstances lend support
to that conclusion. The fiscal year for the petitioner
ended July 31. Probably through inadvertence, the first
waiver refers to a tax for the calendar year ending December 31. This might have seemed to exclude the first six
months of the year ending July 31, 1917,Ji. e., theperiod
from July 31, 1916 to January 1 following. We do not
say that the courts would uphold so literal a construction.
Almost certainly the objection, if made, would be put
aside as hypercritical. See 39 Stat., c. 463, p. 770, § 13.
Even so, the memorandum may well be allocated to the
waiver that fits it precisely in preference to the one that
fits it imperfectly. We turn, then, to the documents in
order to relate them to one another. If we look only to
its letter, the memorandum does not refer to a waiver
for the calendar year ending December 31, 1917. It refers, on the contrary, to a waiver for the fiscal year ending
July 31, 1917 (7/31/17). The only waiver corresponding
to this description in form as well as in substance is the
one filed with the Commissioner February 19, 1923, which
covers the year ending July 31, 1917, as well as the year
after.
The inference, therefore, is legitimate that the second
of the two waivers is the one that the Commissioner had
in view when .he wrote this memorandum indicative of
assent. At the very least the effect of the entry is to
leave the purpose of the writer doubtful. Choice between two doubts should be made in such a way as to
favor the presumption of official regularity.
3. The petitioner has failed to make out the existence
of an account stated for its benefit, and its claim, even
if otherwise valid, is barred by limitation.
Payment of the tax for the fiscal year ending July 31,
1918, was made by the petitioner, partly in 1918, and

STEARNS CO. v. UNITED STATES.
54

Opinion of the Court.

partly in 1919. Five years from the date of payment, a
statute of limitations set up a bar to a suit fol the recovery of the tax on the ground of illegal assessment or
collection. R.S. § 3226; 26 U.S.C. § 156; Bonwit Teller
& Co. v. United States, 283 U.S. 258, 265. The'petitioner,.
conceding this, maintains that in June, 1924, there was a
statement of an account, giving rise to a new cause of
action with a new term of limitation. Dqube v. United
States, 289 -U.S. 367, 370; Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United
States, supra. This suit was not brought till May, 1930.
In the absence of an" account stated in its favor. the
petitioner must fail.
A recent judgment of this court recalls the essentials
of an account stated s they were long ago defined.
Daube v. United States, supra. A balance must have
been struck in such circumstances as to'import a promise.
of payment on the one side and acceptance on the other.
But plainly no such promise is a just or reasonable inference from the certificate of overassessment delivered to
this taxpayer, if the certificate is interpreted in the setting of.the occasion. The taxpayer knew that the Commissioner had been requested, after determining the overassessment, to set it off against the tax for an earlier year.
The taxpayer knew also that the set-off or credit would
not appear on the face of the certificate of overassessment,
but would require reference to another and later document, the schedule of refunds and credits. The diverse
functions of these documents were pointed out by this
court in United States v. Swift & Co., 282 U.S. 468, 475
and Girard Trust Co. v. United States, 270 U.S. 163, 170.
The taxpayer knew also that it had signed a formal
waiver extending the term of collection until March, 1925,
and it had no reason to believe that this waiver had not
been signed by the Commissipner, if it be assumed for
present purposes that such a signature was necessary.

66

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion 6f the Court.

291 U.S.

Plainly, in such circumstances the certificate of overassessment without more does not import a promise by
the Commissioner to refund the amount there certified
instead of applying it as a credit upon the tax of an earlier
year. At most the promise to be implied is one to refund
the excess after there has been a computation of the taxes
unpaid for other years and an ascertainment .of the balance. The statement of the account is not unconditional
and definitive. It is provisional and tentative. Finality
was lacking until there was an agreement as to credits.
Newburger-MorrisCo. v. Talcott, 219 N.Y. 505, 512; 114
N.E. 846.
The events that followed confirm this interpretation of
the effect of the transaction. Upon a computation of the
credits the final balance was ascertained to be in favor of
the Government. The balance thereby fixed was reported
to the taxpayer. After the schedule of refund and
credits had been signed by the Commissioner, the Collector
transmitted to the taxpayer a new statement of account
by which it was clearly made to appear that the overassessment had been credited upon the tax for 1917, and
that after such credit there was still owing from the taxpayer a balance of $5,829.07, which, together with the
accrued interest, was thereupon collected. Then for the
first time was there a final ascertainment of the balance
upon consideration of both sides of the account, the debits
and the credits. The taxpayer did not object to the
account as submitted in its final form. Far from objecting, it paid the resulting balance, and by this act as well
as by silence conceded the indebtedness. Indeed, there
was more than .anaccount stated; by force of voluntary
payment there was also an account settled. Lockwood v.
Thorne, 18 N.Y. 285, 292. The statute of limitations is
a bar to the recovery by the petitioner of the balance paid
to the Government upon the demand of the Collector.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR'WTHE
NINTH CIRCUIT.'

No. 240. Argued December 14, 15, 1933.-Decided January.8, 1934.
1. The Federal Trade Commission Act makes the Commission's findings of fact conclusive if supported by evidence; and, upon appeal
from the Commission's order, the Circuit Court of Appeals is not at
liberty to make its own appraisal of the testimony and pick and
choose for itself among uncertain and conflicting,. inferences. P.73.
2. :The Commission ordered Pacific Coast lumber dealers to desist
from the practice of selling, under the trade name of "California
White Pine," lumber made from "Western Yellow Pine" (Pinus
ponderosa), -finding it an unfair and pejudicial method of competing with lumber made from the true White Pines (Pinus strobus
and closely related species), a product of better quality and commanding a .higher price. Held:
(1) That the evidence supported the Commission (a) in finding
that the lumber sold by the trade name " California White Pine"
is inferior to the true white pine lmber; (b) in finding that the
trade name is misleading and causes both confusion and prejudice
to retailers, architects,'builders, and consumers. Pp. 76, 77.
(2) The fact that "California White Pine" is listed as a trad6
equivalent of Pinus ponderosa in a list of standard commercial
names for lumber, forming part of a report of "Simplified Practice
Recommendations" issued by the Bureau of Standards, is of little
weight as evidence, considering the nature of the Bureau's function
and the basis and purpose of its recommendations. P. 73.
