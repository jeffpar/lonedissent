SILVERTHORNE LUMBER CO. v. UNITED STATES. 385
Argument for the United States.

SILVERTHORNE LUMBER COMPANY, INC., ET
AL. v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 358.

Argued December 12, 1919.-Decided January 26, 1920.

The Fourth Amendment protects a corporation and its officers from
compulsory production of the corporate books and papers for use
in a criminal proceeding against them, when the information upon
which the subpoenas were framed was derived by the Government

through a previous unconstitutional search and seizure, planned and
executed by its officials under color of a void writ; provided the
defense of the Amendment be seasonably interposed, and not first
raised as a collateral issue at the trial of the indictment.

P. 391.

Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, followed. Adams v. New York,
.192 U. S. 585, distinguished.
The rights of a corporation against unlawful search and seizure are
to be protected even if it be not protected by the Fifth Amendment
from compulsory production of incriminating documents. P. 392.
Reversed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. William D. Guthrie, with whom Mr. Henry W. Killeen, Mr. James 0. Moore, Mr. FredericD. McKenney and
Mr. Myer Cohen were on the briefs, for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, with whom
Mr. W. C. Herron was on the brief, for the United States:
The question whether the subpoenas authorized an
unreasonable search and seizure is separate from the
question whether obedience would unconstitutionally compel self-incrimination. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments
are distinct. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 71, 72; Wilson
v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, 371.

The subpoenas are as specific as was reasonably possible. A subpoena duces tecum, like a search warrant,
must necessarily be, to some extent, a demand for discovery. Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont, 207
U. S. 541, 553, 554; Wilson v. United States, supra, 376;
Wheeler v. United States, 226 U. S. 478. Whether the
terms of a subpoena violate the requirements of the
Fourth Amendment can not be determined by its effect
upon business convenience of the corporation.
The validity of an "arrestor seizure is to be determined
by the condition obtaining when objection is made.
If then valid, the fact that a prior arrest or seizure,
effective in bringing about the valid action, was entirely
or partially illegal is immaterial and tenders a collateral
issue. This rule is firmly established. Gelston v. Hoyt,
3 Wheat. 246, 310; Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342,
359; Mahon v. Justice, 127 U. S. 700, 708; Pettibone
v. Nichols, 203 U. S. 192, 216, 217; Kelly v. Griffin, 241
U. S. 6, 12, 13.
Where liberty of the person is involved, a valid detention is not affected by prior illegal arrests even though
the present detention is made possible solely through
them. Papers and books are not entitled to any greater
immunity. Adams v. New York, 176 N. Y. 351, 358;
s. c. 192 U. S. 585, 594-598; Perlman Rim Corporation

Certain decisions, where a motion to return papers was

gne exception, be explained upon the ground that the

papers would not have been admissible in evidence as
against a claim of immunity under the Fifth Amendment,
and, hence, to bring in or retain them would have been idle.
United States v. Mills, 185 Fed. Rep. 318; United States
v. McHie, 194 Fed. Rep. 894; United States v. Mounday,
208 Fed. Rep. 186; United States v. Jones, 230 Fed. Rep.
262; United States v. Abrams, 230 U. S. 313; United States
v. Friedberg, 233 Fed. Rep. 313; Veeder v. United States,
252 Fed. Rep. 414; In re Marx, 255 Fed. Rep. 344. The
one exception is the case of In re Tri-State Coal & Coke
Co., 253 Fed. Rep. 605, where the court clearly overlooked the rule that a corporation can not plead immunity
from self-incrimination and that therefore the books,
etc., in question, in so far as relevant, should have been
retained by the court, irrespective of the invalidity of
the search warrant.
Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, is, in so far as
the Fourth Amendment is concerned, a case where the
trial court should have refused to retain custody of
the papers, not because of anything connected with
the original unlawful seizure, but because of the defendant's claim of immunity under the Fifth Amendment,
the papers being the private papers of an individual
seized at his residence. We respectfully submit, therefore, that according to the settled principles of the law
the subsequent valid subpoenas issued by the court in
the case at bar were not in any way vitiated or weakened
in authority or effect by reason of the prior illegal seizure.
A corporation, either state or federal, can not plead
immunity from self-incriminating testimony under the
Fifth Amendment as to its books and papers. Hale v.
Henkel, supra, 74, 75; Nelson v. United States, 201 U. S.
92; Alexander v. United States, 201 U. S. 117; American
Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U. S. 284; Hammond

R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., 221 U. S. 612,
622, 623;Wheeler v. United States, supra, 489.
This hAs been the uniform rule of the lower federal
courts, so far as we have been able to discover. International Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 152 Fed.
Rep. 557; United States v. Philadelphia& Reading Ry.
Co., 225 Fed. Rep. 301; Orvig v. New York & Bermudez
Co., 229 Fed. Rep. 293; In re Rosenwasser Bros., supra;
New York Central R. R. Co. v. United States, 165 Fed.
Rep. 833. The decisions were not rested on the special
right of the State to inquire into the abuse of franchises
granted by itself, through proceedings in the nature of
quo warranto. The United States is not foreign to the
several States in the sense that it cannot effectively
execute its laws as to corporations doing business under
state charters.
The Fifth Amendment is coextensive with the common
law. What the latter granted or grants, the Amendment secures, no more, no less. State v. Quarles, 13
Arkansas, 307, 311; State v. Fuller, 34 Montana, 12, 19.
Therefore, when this court decided that a corporation
has no constitutional immunity from self-incrimination,
it necessarily decided that it had no common-law immunity. This is clearly brought out in the Wilson Case, 221
U. S. 386, where the court cited the English cases and
held them not controlling.
In Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, the question
whether the privilege against self-incrimination is included in the legal content of the term "due process of
law," mooted in Adams v. New York and the Consolidated
Rendering Co. Case, was fully considered, and it was
held that it was not.
If a corporation is not entitled at any time or under
any circumstances to plead compulsory self-incrimination
as to the books and papers,-if it is not entitled as to

SILVERTHORNE LUMBER CO. v. UNITED STATES. 389

such books and papers to the privileges guaranteed by
the Fifth Amendment,-then it can not indirectly obtain the benefit of this Amendment by objecting to the
manner in which the Government got its information
resulting in perfectly lawful compulsory production. The
case does not differ from one where the witness does
not plead self-incrimination, as to which see Blair v.
United States, 250 U. S. 273. Such a witness could be
compelled to produce relevant testimony, though the
knowledge that he had it and of its precise extent had
been derived from illegal acts of public officials.
Illegal action of subordinate public officials can not
forever prevent the United States from securing by
legal process relevant evidence of a violation of its laws
where no right under the Fifth Amendment can be successfully set up. Flagg v. United States, 233 Fed. Rep.
481, 487; Adams v. New York, supra, 597, 598. In
Weeks v. United States, supra, there was a denial by
the court of a petition for the return of the papers.
This amounted to the issuance by the court of a subpcena duces tecum for them (see Kelly v. Griffin, supra,)
or to an impounding order, and hence to compulsory
process for their production as evidence. It was for
this reason that this court reversed the judgment, and
not because of their reception as evidence. And this
seems to be the view taken by all the lower federal courts
who have had occasion to consider the matter, except
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See, e. g.,
Lyman v. United States, 241 Fed. Rep. 945; Rice v.
United States, 251 Fed. Rep. 778; Laughter v. United
States, 259 Fed. Rep. 94; Flagg v. United States, 233 Fed.
Rep. 481; Fitter v. United 8tates, 258 Fed. Rep. 567.

of the-papers in question, can not object to lawful, sufficiently definite subpoenas to produce them because the
knowledge of their existence and of their contents was
derived from a prior illegal seizure. To sanction such
objection would be to offer a premium to a witness who
could successfully conceal from the State the possession
of relevant evidence of the violation of its criminal laws.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error brought to reverse a judgment of
the District Court fining the Silverthorne Lumber Company two hundred and fifty dollars for contempt of court
and ordering Frederick W. Silverthorne to be imprisoned
until he should purge himself of a similar contempt. The
contempt in question was a refusal to obey subpoenas
and an order of Court to produce books and documents
of the company before the grand jury to be used in regard
to alleged violation of the statutes of the United States
by the said Silverthorne and his father. One ground of
the refusal was that the order of the Court infringed the
rights of the parties under the Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States.
The facts are smple. An indictment upon a single
specific charge having been brought against the two Silverthornes mentioned, they both were arrested at their homes
early in the morning of February 25, 1919, and were detained in custody a number of hours. While they were
thus detained representatives of the Department of
Justice and the United States marshal without a shadow of
authority went to the office of their company and made a
clean sweep of all the books, papers and documents found
there. All the employees were taken or directed to go to
the office of the District Attorney of the United States
to which also the books, &c., were taken at once. An
application was made as soon as might be to the District

Opinion of the Court.

Court for a return of what thus had been taken unlawfully. It was opposed by the District Attorney so far as
he had found evidence against the plaintiffs in error, and
it was stated that the evidence so obtained was before the
grand jury. Color had been given by the District Attorney to the approach of those concerned in the act by
an invalid subpcena for certain documents relating to the
charge in the indictment then on file. Thus the case is
not that of knowledge acquired through the wrongful act
of a stranger, but it must be assumed that the Government
planned or at all events ratified the whole performance.
Photographs and copies of material papers were made and
a new indictment was framed based upon the knowledge
thus obtained. The District Court ordered a return of
the originals but impounded the photographs and copies.
Subpoenas to produce the originals then were served and
on the refusal of the plaintiffs in error to produce them the
Court made an order that the subpcenas should be complied with, although it had found that all the papers had
been seized in violation of the parties' constitutional
rights. The refusal to obey this order is the contempt
alleged. The Government now, while in form repudiating and condemning the illegal seizure, seeks to maintain its right to avail itself of the knowledge obtained by
that means which otherwise it would not have had.
The proposition could not be presented more nakedly. It
is that although of course its seizure was an outrage which
the Government now regrets, it may study the papers before
it returns them, copy them, and then may use the knowledge that it has gained to call upon the owners in a more
regular form to produce them; that the protection of the
Constitution covers the physical possession but not any
advantages that the Government can gain over the object of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act. Weeks v.
United States, 232 U. S. 383, to be sure, had established
that laying the papers directly before the grand jury was

unwarranted, but it is taken to mean only that two steps
are required instead of one. In our opinion such is not
the law. It reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of
words.

232 U. S. 393.

The essence of a provision for-

bidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is
that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used
before the Court but that it shall not be used at all. Of
course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained
become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them
is gained from an independent source they may be proved
like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Governme nt's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed. The numerous decisions, like Adams v. New
York, 192 U. S. 585, holding that a collateral inquiry
into the mode in which evidence has been got will not be
allowed when the question is raised for the first time at
the trial, are no authority in the present proceeding, as
is explained in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 394,
395. Whether some of those decisions have gone too far
or have given wrong reasons it is unnecessary to inquire;
the principle applicable to the present case seems to us
plain. It is stated satisfactorily in Flagg v. United States,
233 Fed. Rep. 481, 483. In Linn v. United States, 251
Fed. Rep. 476, 480, it was thought that a different rule
applied to a corporation, on the ground that it was not
privileged from producing its books and papers. But
the rights of a corporation against unlawful search and
seizure are to be protected even if the same result might
have been achieved in a lawful way.
Judgment reversed.
