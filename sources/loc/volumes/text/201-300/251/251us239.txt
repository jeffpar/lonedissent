Syllabus.

of the United States (excepted from the Conformity Act,
see Rev. Stats., §§ 913-914) laches is a defense that need
not be set up by plea or answer. It rests upon the longestablished doctrine of courts of equity that their extraordinary relief will not be accorded to one who delays
the assertion of his claim for an unreasonable length of
time, especially where the delay has led to a change of
conditions that would render it unjust to disturb them at
his instance. It is for the complainant in his bill to excuse
the delay in seeking equitable relief, where there has been
such; and if it be not excused his laches may be taken advantage of either by demurrer or upon final hearing. Maxwell v. Kennedy, 8 How. 210, 222; Badger v. Badger, 2

No. 84.

Argued November 17, 1919.-Decided January 5, 1920.

Section 63a of the Bankruptcy Act, defining provable debts, does not
include a claim for unliquidated damages, arising out of a pure tort
which neither constitutes a breach of an express contract nor results

in any unjust enrichment of the tort-feasor upon which a contract
may be implied. P. 248.
Clause b of that section, in providing that unliquidated claims
may be liquidated in such manner as the court shall direct and
may thereafter be proved, refers to claims defined as provable
by.clause a, and not already liquidated, especially those founded
upon open account or contract, and has not the effect of admitting all unliquidated claims, including those of tortious origin. Id.
Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, which declares that a discharge shall
release the bankrupt from all of his "provable debts" except certain
classes specified, refers to § 63 for the definition of what debts are
provable, and does not by the excepting clause add other classes
but merely limits the effect of a discharge; and this is true also
of the amendment of February 5, 1903 (c. 487, § 5, 32 Stat. 797, 798).
P. 251.
To permit a person defrauded by a partnership to prove his claim for
damages as a quasi contract or equitable debt of the partnership
which profited, and also of the individual partners who did not
profit, by the fraud, would ignore the distinction between partnership and individual debts and the respective equities of the two
classes of creditors as established by § 5 of the Bankruptcy Act.
P. 254.
Worthless commercial paper, drawn by a partnership, was sold in the
course of its business, by means of fraudulent representations, for a
full consideration which went to the partnership and did not profit
the partners as individuals save through their interests in the partnership. The firm and its members individually having been
thrown into bankruptcy, held, that the claim of the defrauded persons, against the individual partners,-as distinct from their claim
against the firm and therein their right to participate as partnership creditors in any surplus that might remain of individual assets
after payment of individual debts-was a claim in tort not provable
in bankruptcy.

members of a firm for frauds perpetrated by them in firm
transactions is authoritatively established in England by
the case of Ex pare Adamson; In re Collie, L. R. 8 Ch.
Div. 807. It is also well established in England that
proof can' be made as upon an implied contract in cases
where an individual member of the firm is implicated in
the misappropriation of moneys by the firm. In re J. & H.
Davison; Ex parte Chandler, 13 Q. B. D. 50. A similar
result has been reached in many cases in courts in this
country. Catts v. Phalen, 2 How. 376; Burton v. Driggs,

v. Swafford, 77 Iowa, 594; First State Bank v. McGaughey,
38 Tex. Civ. App. 495.
The question whether a claim for pure tort is provable
in bankruptcy has never been definitely, decided by this
court. The ultimate decision will rest upon the construction given to subsection b of § 63 of the Bankruptcy
Act. Crawford v. Burke, 195 U. S. 176, 186; Dunbar v.
Dunbar, 190 U. S. 340; Friend v. Talcott, 228 U. S. 27;
Clarke v. Rogers, 228'U. S. 534. See Collier on Bankruptcy, 9th ed., p. 853; Jackson v. Wauchula Mfg. Co.,
230 Fed. Rep. 409.
Under the early English bankruptcy statutes proofs of
unliquidated claims both in tort and on contract were not
permitted; subsequently the rule was relaxed to permit
proof of unliquidated claims arising out of contracts, but
lest in making the departure it might be inferred that the
rule against proof of unliquidated claims had been entirely
abrogated, it was thought necessary in both the English
Bankruptcy Statutes of 1869 and 1883 to provide expressly
against the proof of unliquidated claims in tort. Williams,
Bankruptcy Practice, 10th ed., p. 142.
Similarly, the American Bankruptcy Act of 1867, § 19,
after enumerating certain debts which might be proved,
at the end of the section contained the provision:

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Petitioners.

251 U. S.

"No debts other than those above specified shall be
proved or allowed against the estate."
Considered in the light of the history of these statutes,
it is quite clear that the change in language in § 63a and b
of our statute of 1898 was designed to abolish thd old rule
against proof of unliquidated claims and to permit proof
of both tort and contract unliquidated claims. The rule
was originally grounded in convenience and related to all
unliquidated claims and there was no good reason when
some unliquidated claims were admitted to proof to exclude others.
The structure of § 63 indicates plainly that "unliquidated claims" in subsection b covers an additional and
distinct class of provable debts. The categories a and b
were thus separated with reference only to the procedure
for proving the different classes of claims.
If § 63a, subdivisions (1) to (4), embrace the whole
range of provable claims, it was not necessary to add subdivision (5) embracing claims "founded upon provable
debts reduced to judgments after the filing of the petition." Section 63a is not intended to be an enumeration
of provable debts exclusive of all other kinds of debts,
demands and claims, but is only an enumeration of claims
which because of their form need no assessment of damages and can be made certain by simple computation and
are therefore outside the class of claims which must
"pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in
such manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be
proved and allowed."
The cases which hold that subsection b, in spite of its
inclusion with paragraph a in a section entitled "Debts
which may be Proved" (Brown v. United Button Co., 140
Fed. Rep. 495, affirmed 149 Fed. Rep. 48; and In re New
York Tunnel Co., 159 Fed. Rep. 688), adds nothing to the
enumeration of paragraph a, have admitted that under
their constructi6n all the debts enumerated in § 63a are

SCHALL v. CAMORS.
239.

Argument for Petitioners.

claims of a liquidated nature, i. e., claims which would
have been admitted to proof under the old English rule,
except those embraced in the last part of § 63a (4) which
embraces "debts . . . founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or implied" and in
order to limit § 63b and to give it some application, have
applied it to the last part of § 63a (4) irrespective of the
fact that every other "debt" enumerated in § 63a is in the
nature of a liquidated demand.
The construction upheld by these cases does violence to
the rule of noscitur a sociis. This section (63) is entitled
"Debts which may be Proved." The word "debts" in
the title obviously means debts in the broad sense including all "debts," "demands," and "claims" provable in
bankruptcy in the same sense as the word "debts" as used
in § 1, subdivision 11.
Section 63b relates to the latter class of liabilities, or
unliquidated claims. The word "claims" in subsection b
is used in a sense distinct from that in which the word
"debt" is employed in § 63a because "debts" may be
proved and allowed while "unliquidated claims" must
first be liquidated and thereafter proved and allowed.
It seems, therefore, to follow that in the title of § 63 the
word "debts" is used in the same sense as in the subject
of the definition sentence, § 1 (11), and the word "debts"
in § 63a and the word "claims" in § 63b are used in the
same sense as those words are used in the predicate of
the definition sentence § 1 (11).
When § 63 and § 17, as amended in 1903, are read together, it becomes evident that tort claims are both
provable and dischargeable. The enumeration of tort
claims in § 17 was considerably augmented by the amendment of 1903 and the only reasonable conclusion to be
drawn from the inclusion by the amendment of certain
liabilities for torts involving wrongful intent and moral
turpitude is that Congress had clearly in mind that by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Petitioners.

251 U. S.

original enactment tort claims, even those embracing
wrongful intent and moral turpitude, were provable and
dischargeable.
Even before the amendment of 1903, § 17 saved from
discharge debts of the bankrupt which were "created by
his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation
while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity."
Crawford v. Burke, 195 U. S. 193.
In the enumeration of debts which are exempted from a
discharge contained in § 17 after the amendment of 1903
practically all are liabilities for torts. ' If tort claims, including the claims enumerated in § 17, were not provable
claims, they would not be discharged, and if they were not
discharged because they were not provable, there was no
reason for exempting them from discharge. The mere
recitation of these tort claims in § 17 indicates that
Congress believed that the claims therein enumerated
were provable claims, and this conclusion is fortified by
the reports of the congressional committee.
The amendment of § 17 in 1903 constituted a legislative
construction of the act that tort claims were provable.
Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 308; Baker
v. Swigart, 199 Fed. Rep. 865, 867. It is reasonable to
conclude that it was intended to put tort creditors and
contract creditors on an equal basis with regard to proof,
as indicated by a natural construction of § 63a and b, so
that the effect of § 60 would be to make preferential
transfers to each class of creditors within the four month
period null and void.
If the statute is ambiguous, the court should adopt
such a construction of § 17 as will make it harmonious
with § 1 (11) and § 63a and b, and consistent with § 60,
and the sections can only be harmonized by holding that
tort claims are provable.
We believe that all the courts which have decided that
tort claims are not provable under the Act of 1898 have

proceeded upon the erroneous assumption that the act,
although it differed radically from the prior statute of
1867 in its wording and structure, must be made to conform to the older statute, and after a consideration of the
words of the statute in order to justify the conclusion
reached, have been obliged to admit, either expressly or
by implication, that in § 17 as amended in 1903, Congress
used the word "liabilities" inadvisedly, in order to sustain
their construction; and counsel for the trustees was forced
to take this position in his brief and on the argument in the
court below. There is no legitimate reason why § 63b
should be stricken down and the natural and normal
meaning of its words disregarded for the purpose of raising
an inconsistency between § 63 (with "b" eliminated by
judicial construction) and § 17, solely to justify the preconceived idea that Congress did not intend that tort
claims not reduced to judgment should be admitted to
proof. The line of argument of the cases holding that
tort claims are not provable is a Very clear illustration of
the logical fallacy known as reasoning in a circle. See
Brown v. United Button Co., 149 Fed. Rep. 48.
The act should be construed equitably (Knowlton v.
Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 65), so as to avoid the discrimination
between tort creditors who have reduced their claims to
judgment and those who have not, and between tort
creditors and contract creditors; so as to give tort creditors
of a bankrupt corporation their only chance to participate
in its assets; to prevent bankrupts from preferring their
tort creditors; and to give full effect to the purpose of the
act, declared by this court, "to permit all creditors to
share . . . and to leave the honest debtor thereafter
free." Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Assn.,

provable (In re Fife, 109 Fed. Rep. 880; In re McCauley,
101 Fed. Rep. 223), and in the absence of the element of
seduction are dischargeable. Judgments for all kinds of
torts, including claims for negligence of the bankrupt or
imputed to him, for assault and battery, libel and slander,
nuisance, fraud, criminal conversation and seduction are
provable. Tinker v. Colwell, 193 U. S. 473; In re Freche,

[Counsel also argued elaborately the proposition that the
claims against the individual partners were provable, as
quasi contracts or equitable debts, and that the right to
prove against both firm and individual assets rested on
general principles unaffected by § 5f and g, of the Bankruptcy Act.]

delivered the opinion of the court.

The transactions out of which this controversy arose
took place in the years 1913 and 1914. At that time LeMore and Carriere carried on business as partners in the
cities of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama.
Afterwards, and in the month of May, 1914, upon an
involuntary petition in bankruptcy, the firm and the
individual members thereof were adjudged bankrupts in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Louisiana, New Orleans Division, and the present
respondents were elected and qualified as trustees of both
the partnership and the individual estates. The present

petitioners, constituting the firm of Muller, Schall &
Company, filed three proofs of claim, one against the
partnership and one against each of the individual partners, all based upon the same transactions, which consisted of the purchase by claimants in the City of New
York, through an agent of the bankrupt firm named
Trippe, of certain bills of exchange and checks drawn by
the firm upon London, Paris, and Antwerp, aggregating
about $70,000, all of which were sold to petitioners for
full value on the faith of certain fraudulent representations not necessary to be specified, and, at maturity, were
presented for payment, dishonored and protested, and
notice thereof given to the firm. At the time of these
transactions Le More was in Europe and Carriere in New
Orleans, and neither of them participated in the particular transactions, although both were cognizant of
them and responsible for the false representations. The
particular drafts and checks were not signed or indorsed by
either partner, and neither profited from their sale except
through his interest in the firm. The transactions occurred in the ordinary course of the firm's business, except that they were fraudulent, and the proceeds of the
drafts and checks went to the credit of the firm and were
used in the conduct of its business. Petitioners' claim
against the partnership is based upon the drafts and
checks as partnership obligations in contract, and also
upon the damages sustained by reason of the fraudulent
representations. The claims against the individual estates of the partners in terms demand only damages for
the false representations, but are relied upon as showing
also, by inference, an individual liability in quasi contract
or equitable debt.
The trustees petitioned the District Court that the
latter claims should be~expunged. After a hearing the
referee in bankruptcy, for reasons expressed in an elaborate opinion, ordered that the claims against the individ-

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

251 U. S.

ual estates should be "expunged and disallowed," and
the rights of claimants to participate in dividends in such
estates denied. Upon review, the District Court affirmed
this order, and, upon appeal, its decree was affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 250 Fed. Rep. 6. A writ of
certiorari brings the case here.
No question is made as to whether the referee's order, in
wholly expunging the claims against the individual
estates and denying to petitioners all participation
therein, went too far in view of the provision of § 5f of the
Bankruptcy Act (July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 548),
that "Should any surplus remain of the property of any
partner after paying his individual debts, such surplus
shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to
the payment of the partnership debts." If the'decision be
sustained, petitioners nevertheless will be entitled, upon
establishing their claim against the partnership, to participate as partnership creditors in any surplus that may
remain of individual assets after payment of individual
debts. What was asserted and overruled was a right to
double proof, establishing a separate and independent
liability on the part of the individual partners that would
give to the claimants, in addition to their participation in
the partnership assets, a participation in the individual
assets on equal terms with other individual creditors and
in preference to other partnership creditors.
The first and fundamental question is whether a claim
for unliquidated damages, arising out of a pure tort which
neither constitutes a breach of an express contract nor
results in any unjust enrichment of the tort-feasor that
may form the basis of an implied contract, is provable in
bankruptcy. This question was passed upon by the
referee and by the District Court; it has been most
elaborately argued pro and con in this court; its general
importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act
warranted a review of the case by certiorari; and hence it is

SCHALL v. CAMORS.
239.

Opinion of the Court.

proper that we dispose of it, without regard to whether a
like result might follow, upon the particular facts of the
case, from a decision of any subordinate question.
Considering, therefore, the question stated: Among
other definitions included in § 1 of the Bankruptcy Act is
this: "(11) 'debt' shall include any debt, demand, or
claim provable in bankruptcy." Section 63 runs as follows: "Debts which may be Proved.-a Debts of the
bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate
which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment
or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the 4ime
of the filing of the petition against him, whether then
payable or not, with any interest thereon which would
have been recoverable at that date or with a rebate of
interest upon such as were not then payable and did not
bear interest; . . . (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or implied;
"b Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may,
pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such
manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved
and allowed against his estate."
In Dunbar v. Dunbar, 190 U. S. 340, 350, it was said:
"This paragraph b, however, adds nothing to the class of
debts which might be prc.ved under paragraph a of the
same section. Its purpose is to permit an unliquidated
claim, coming within the provisions of section 63a, to be
liquidated as the court should direct.,' But' in Crawford
v. Burke, 195 U. S. 176, 187, the question whether the
effect of paragraph b was to cause an unliquidated claim,
susceptible of liquidation but not literally embraced by
paragraph a, to be provable in bankruptcy was regarded
as still open.
That clause b provides the procedure for liquidating
claims provable under clause a if not already liquidated,
especially those founded upon an open accbunt or a contract express or implied, is entirely clear, and has been

recognized repeatedly in our decisions. Grant Shoe Co. v.
Laird Co., 212 U. S. 445, 447-448; Central Trust Co. v.
Chicago Auditorium Assn., 240 U. S. 581, 592. Has it the
further effect of admitting all unliquidated claims, including those of tortious origin?
Historically, bankruptcy laws, both in England and in
this country, have dealt primarily and particularly with
the concerns of traders. Our earlier bankruptcy acts
invariably have been regarded as excluding from consideration unliquidated claims arising purely ex delicto.
Act of April 4, 1800, c. 19, 2 Stat. 19; Dusar v. Murgatroyd, 1 Wash. C. C. 13; Fed. Case No. 4199 (8 Fed.

No. 12,483 (21 Fed. Cas. 739, 742); In re Boston & Fairhaven Iron Works, 23 Fed. Rep. 880.
Can it be supposed that the present act was intended
to depart so widely from the precedents as to include mere
tort claims among the provable debts? Its 63d section
does not so declare in terms, and there is nothing in the
history of the act to give ground for such an inference.
It was the result of a long period of agitation, participated
in by commercial conventions, boards of trade, chambers
of commerce, and other commercial bodies. To say
nothing of measures proposed in previous Congresses, a
bill in substantially the present form was favorably reported by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of
Representatives in the First Session of the 54th Congress.
Having then failed of passage, it was submitted again
in the Second Session of the 55th Congress as a substitute
for a Senate bill; after disagreeing votes of the two Houses,
it went to conference, and as the result of a Conference

Report became law. It is significant that § 63 defining
"Debts which may be Proved" remained unchanged from
first to last, except for a slight and insignificant variance
in clause (5) in the final print, the word" interests" having
been substituted for ".interest." House Rep. No. 1228,
54th Cong., 1st sess., p. 39; House Rep. No. 65, 55th
Cong., 2d sess., p. 21; Senate Doe. No. 294, 55th Cong.,
2d sess., p. 22. Evidently the words of the section were
carefully chosen; and the express mention of contractual
obligations naturally excludes those arising from a mere
tort. Since claims founded upon an open account or
upon a contract express or implied often require to be
liquidated, some provision for procedure evidently was
called for; clause b fulfills this function, and would have to
receive a strained interpretation in order that it should
include claims arising purely ex delicto. Such claims might
easily have been mentioned if intended to be included.
Upon every consideration, we are clear that claims based
upon a mere tort are not provable. Where the tortious act
constitutes at the same time a breach of contract a different question may be raised, with which we have no present
concern; and where, by means of the tort, the tort-feasor
obtains something of value for which an equivalent price
ought to be paid, even if the tort as such be forgiven, there
may be a provable claim quasi ex contractu. Crawford v
Burke, 195 U. S. 176, 187; Tindle v. Birkett, 205 U. S.
183, 186; Clarke v. Rogers, 183 Fed. Rep. 518, 521-522;
affd. 228 U. S. 534, 543.
Of course, §§ 63 and 17 are to be read together. The
reference in the latter section to "provable debts," defined
in the former, would be sufficient to show this. See Crawford v. Burke, 195 U. S. 176, 193; Tindle v. Birkett, 205
U. S. 183, 186; Friendv. Talcott, 228 U. S. 27, 39; Clarke v.

that § 17 as amended in 1903 (Act of February 5, 1903,

construction admitting tort claims to proof. The section
as it stood before, and the nature of the amendment, are
set forth in the margin.' We are referred to the Committee's report (House Rep. No. 1698, 57th Cong., 1st
sess., pp. 3, 6) as indicating that by the law as it stood,
in the opinion of the Committee, claims created by fraud
but not reduced to judgment were discharged; reference
having been made to In re Rhutassel, 96 Fed. Rep. 597,
and In re Lewensohn, 99 Fed. Rep. 73 (affd., 104 Fed.
Rep. 1006), as contradictory decisions upon the point.
But neither the report of the Committee nor the language
of the amendment gives the least suggestion of an intent
to enlarge the description of provable claims as set forth
in § 63. On the contrary, the purpose was to limit more
Section as originally enacted (30 Stat. 550).
"Sec. 17. Debts not Affected by a Discharge.-a A discharge in
bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts,
except such as (1) are due as a tax levied by the United States, the
State, county, district, or municipality in which he resides; (2) are
judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses
or false representations,or for willful and malicious injuries to the person
or property of another; (3) have not been duly scheduled in time for
proof and allowance, with the name of the creditor if known. to the
bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the
proceedings in bankruptcy; or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in
any fiduciary capacity."
Amendment of 1903 (32 Stat. 798) inserted in the place of clause 2
the following:
"(2) are liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or false
representations,orfor willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another, or for alimony due or to become due, orfor maintenance or
support of wife or child, or for seduction of an unmarriedfemale, or for
criminal conversation."
NoTE: By a further amendment (Act of March 2, 1917, c. 153, 39
- Stat. 999) there was inserted after the word "female,"
instead of "or
for criminal conversation," the following: "or for breach of promise of

the scope of the exception was qualified by the fact
that the discharge released the bankrupt only from" provable debts.". And if the excepting clause as amended
might seem to extend to some claims not otherwise
provable, its own force must be deemed to be limited
by referring to § 63 for the definition of provability. It
is not admissible to give to this amendment, confessedly
designed to restrict the scope of a discharge in bankruptcy, the effect of enlarging the class of provable
claims.
Aside from § 17 or the amendment thereof, it has been
held by the federal courts generally that § 63 does not
authorize the liquidation and proof of claims arising ex
delicto and unaffected by contract express or implied. In
re Hirschman, 104 Fed. Rep. 69, 70-71; In re Yates, 114
Fed. Rep. 365, 367; In re Crescent Lumber Co., 154 Fed.
Rep. 724, 727; In re Southern Steel Co., 183 Fed. Rep.
498.
And that the amendment of § 17 does not enlarge the class
of provable claims enumerated in § 63 has been recognized
in several well-considered decisions of the federal courts,
which have held, upon satisfactory grounds, that pure tort
claims are not provable. In re United Button Co., 140
Fed. Rep. 495, 499 et seq.; s. c. on appeal, Brown v. United
Button Co., 149 Fed. Rep. 48, 52-53; In re New York
Tunnel Co., 159 Fed. Rep. 688, 690. In Jackson v.
Wauchula Mfg. Co., 230 Fed. Rep. 409, 411; and again in
the present case (250 Fed. Rep. 7), the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit passed the question as unnecessary for the decision.
There is an argument ab inconvenienti, based upon the
supposed danger that if tort claims be held not provable
they may be preferred by failing debtors without redress

under § 60, a and b (30 Stat. 562); amended February 5,
1903, c. 487, § 13, 32 Stat. 797, 799; amended June 25,
1910, c. 412, § 11, 36 Stat. 838, 842), held to apply only to
provable claims (Richardson v. Shaw, 209 U. S. 365, 381;
see, also, Clarke v. Rogers, 228 U. S. 534, 542). We are not
much impressed. If there be danger of mischief here,
other than such as may be reached under the provisions
of § 67e or § 70e respecting fraudulent conveyances and
transfers (see Dean v. Davis, 242 U. S. 438, 444), the
Congress may be trusted to supply the remedy by an
appropriate amendment.
It is insisted by petitioners, further, that because the
proofs of the individual claims establish the responsibility
of each partner for the frauds, they are liable in solido not
only as partners but individually; and that, irrespective
of whether the claims are provable in tort for the fraud,
they are provable and were properly proved both against
the individual partners and against the firm as claims in
quasi contract or equitable debt. But as the basis of a
liability of this character is the unjust enrichment of the
debtor, and as the facts show that no benefit accrued to
,the individuals as a result of the frauds beyond that which
accrued to the firm, the logical result of the argument is
that out of one enrichment there may arise three separate
and independent indebtednesses. Doubtless it would be
conceded that a single satisfaction would discharge all
of the claims; but we are dealing with a situation where by
reason of insolvency it is not to be presumed that claims
will be satisfied in full; and, as already pointed out, the
effect of sustaining the right to double proof would be to
give petitioners not only a right to share in the partnership assets on equal terms with other partnership creditors
but a participation in the individual assets on equal terms
with other individual creditors and in preference to other
partnership creditors. Section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act
(30 Stat. 547-548) establishes on a firm basis the respective

equities of the individual and firm creditors.' Hence the
distinction between individual and firm debts is a matter
of substance, and must depend upon the essential character of the transactions out of which they arise. And
since, in this case, the tort was done in the course of the
partnership business, for the benefit of the firm and without benefit to the partners as individuals, no legal or equitable claim as against the individuals that might be deemed
to arise out of it, by waiver of the tort or otherwise, can
displace the equities of other creditors, recognized in the
Bankruptcy Act, and put petitioners in a position of
equality with others who actually were creditors of the
individual partners, and of preference over other firm
creditors. Reynolds v. New York Trust Co., 188 Fed. Rep.
611, 619-620.
Decree affirmed.
"See. 5. Partners."d The trustee shall keep separate accounts 'of the partnership
property and of the property belonging to the individual partners.
"f The net proceeds of tne partnership property shall be appropriated
to the payment of the partnership debts, and the net proceeds of the
individual estate of each partner to the payment of his individual
debts. Should any surplus remain of the property of any partner after
paying his individual debts, such surplus shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to the payment of the partnership
debts.

"g The court may permit the proof of the claim of the partnership
estate against the individual estates, and vice versa, and may marshal
the assets of the partnership estate and individual estates so as to prevent preferences and secure the equitable distribution of the property
of the several estates.
