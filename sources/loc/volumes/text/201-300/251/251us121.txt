PETERS v. VEASEY.
Opinion of the Court.

PETERS ET AL. v. VEASEY, ADMINISTRATRIX

OF VEASEY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF THE STATE OF

LOUISIANA.
No. 77.

Argued November 14, 1919.-Decided December 8, 1919.

Prior to the Act of October 6, 1917, c. 97, 40 Stat. 395, amending Jud.
Code, §§ 24, cl. 3, and 256, cl. 3, a state workmen's compensation
law had no application to a case of personal injuries suffered by one
'employed as a longshoreman, while engaged as such, on board, in

unloading a ship. P. 122. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S.
205.
The Act of October 6, 1917, supra, was not intended to apply to a cause
of action of that character, which arose before the act was passed.
Id.
142 Louisiana, 1012, reversed.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. George Janvier, with whom Mr. William C. Dufour,
Mr. Gustave Lemle, Mr. A. A. Moreno and Mr. John St.
Paul, Jr., were on the brief, for plaintiffs in error.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

court.

In a proceeding under the Workmen's Compensation
Law of Louisiana (No. 20, Acts La., 1914), the Supreme
Court of that State affirmed a judgment against plaintiffs
in error and in favor of Veasey, who claimed to have
suffered injuries, August 6, 1915, while employed by Henry

and Eugene Peters as a longshoreman on board the
"Seria," then lying at New Orleans. The steamer was
being unloaded. While upon her and engaged in that
work, Veasey accidentally fell through a hatchway. 142
Louisiana, 1012.
A compensation policy in favor of Peters, issued by the
Etna Life Insurance Company, was in force when the
accident occurred.
The work in which Veasey was engaged is maritime
in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract;
the injuries which he received were likewise maritime;
and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection
therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. In such circumstances, the Workmen's Compensation Law of the State had no application when the
accident occurred. Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek,
234 U. S. 52, 59, 60, 61; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,
244 U. S. 205, 217, 218.
Clause third, § 24, of the Judicial Code, confers upon
the District Courts of the United States jurisdiction "of
all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,
saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law
remedy where the common law is competent to give it."
Clause third, § 256, provides that the jurisdiction of the
courts of the United States shall be exclusive in "all civil
causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to
suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy
where the common law is competent to give it." By an
act approved October 6, 1917i c. 97, 40 Stat. 395, Congress
directed that both of these clauses be amended by inserting after "saving to suitors in all cases the right of a
common-law remedy where the common law is competent
to give it," the words "and to claimants the rights and
remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any
State." The court below erroneously concluded that this
act should be given retroactive effect and applied in the

present controversy. There is nothing in the language
employed, nor is there any circumstance known to us,
which indicates a purpose to make the act applicable
when the cause of action arose before its passage; and we
think it must not be so construed.
The judgment of the court below is reversed and the
cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN & HARTFORD RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 74. Argued May 2, 1919.-Decided December 8, 1919.
Semble, that under Rev. Stats., § 4002, as amended, the Postmaster
General may fix the sums payable to a railroad company for transporting the mails upon the basis of weights taken immediately
before the beginning of the four-year term of the contract, and that
annual weighings are not required. P. 126.
A railroad company which knowingly contracts and receives on this
basis less than it would have received on the basis of annual weighings has no implied contract right to be paid the difference by-the
United States. P. 127.
Prior to the Act of July 28, 1916, e. 261, 39 Stat. 429, a non-land-grant
railroad was not required to carry the mails; and when it voluntarily
accepted and performed the service with knowledge of what the
United States intended to pay, it cannot claim more upon the ground
that its property was taken. Id.
53 Ct. Clms. 222, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
