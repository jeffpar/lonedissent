APPEAL

Messrs. J. Alston Atkins and Carter Walker Wesley
for the appellants.
The sale of an oil and gas lease on a ward's land
should be governed by the law providing for the sale of
real property.
The appointment of the guardian was void under the
laws of Oklahoma for want of notice. Cummings v.

There is no distinction here between an oil and gas lease

The Oklahoma law which authdrizes the appointment
of a guardian for the person and property of an individual who is alleged to be a minor, without any notice or
opportunity to be heard, is not due process of law. That
these laws do not require notice to the alleged minor, see
Crabtree v. Bath, 102 Okla. 1. It is to be remembered
that a finding of minority is conclusive against collateral
attack. Johnson v. Johnson, 60 Okla. 206; Johnson v.

To constitute due process, the notice and opportunity
to be heard must be required by the state law. Coe v.

would have been no defense if notice had been given.

JONES v. PRAIRIE OIL CO.
195

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a bill in equity seeking the cancellation of oil
and gas leases to, or held by, the Prairie Oil and Gas
Company, and for an account. The fundamental facts
are as follows. Leonard D. Ingram was a member of
the Muskogee (Creek) Nation and as such on July 1,
1907, received patents of homestead and other land, the
homestead patent expressing the conditions provided by
Act of Congress, that the land should be inalienable, &c.,
for twenty-one years. On January 3, 1911, the County
Court of Wagoner County, Oklahoma, made an order appointing Minerva Ingram, now Minerva Jones, guardian
of Leonard D. Ingram. On January 24, 1911, March 28,
1911, and December 18, 1911, Minerva Ingram, acting as
guardian, made the leases in question, covering the above
lands and running for as long after the minority of Leonard Ingram as oil or gas should be found in paying quantities. The defendant company began to remove oil and
gas in 1920 and is continuing to do so still. The leases
are said to be invalid for several reasons: It is alleged
that the appointment of Minerva Ingram as guardian was
void under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution because no notice of the application for appointment
was given. It is alleged further that the guardian had
no power to execute leases that would or might outlast
the minority of the ward, as that again is thought to be
contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Thirdly it is
urged that the inclusion of the homestead was invalid
because of the condition against alienation in the patent
under the Act of Congress, notwithstanding the later Act
of May 27, 1908, c. 199; 35 Stat. 312, which is admitted
to apply, but is said to be ineffective under the Fifth
Amendment, as depriving the minor of his property without due process of law. Finally, it is averred that the
leases were not executed in manner and form required by

273 U. S.

law. Orf motion the District Court dismissed the bill and
the plaintiffs appealed to this Court. Lipke v. Lederer,
259 U. S. 557, 560.
The averment that the guardian was appointed without
notice was qualified by an amendment showing an order
for a hearing on January 3, 1911, and for notice by posting
in three public places, one being the door of the Court
House. The notice was posted as directed but although
dated December 15, 1910, states January 3, 1910, instead
of 1911, as the time for the hearing. It was also sent by
mail to the minor, to Minerva Ingram and three others,
stated to be next of kin and persons having the care of
the minor. It is admitted that Minerva Ingram was the
mother of the minor, and the record indicates that the
latter was of tender years, or at least under twelve, which
is not denied. The mother seems to have had him in her
custody. The Oklahoma statutes only require such notice
as the judge deems reasonable to be given to the relatives
residing in the county and to any person having the care
of such minor. Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921, § 1431.
In the circumstances stated, unqualified, the requirement
of notice is merely formal, if it exists. Lester v. Smith,
83 Okla. 143. Gibson, Appellant, 154 Mass. 378, 379-381.
Certainly there is nothing in the Constitution of the
United States that requires it. See Hoyt v. Sprague, 103
U. S. 613. The clerical error in the notice would mislead
no one and did not invalidate the proceedings. The
mother was the petitioner and no one but the mother
and son were concerned. We see nothing to overcome
the presumption if any presumption were needed, in favor
of the validity of the appointment, declared to exist by
the Supreme Court of the State. Baker v. Cureton, 49
Okla. 15.
The Oklahoma statutes are held to give to guardians
the power to execute oil and gas leases that may last
beyond the minority of their wards. Cabin Valley Min-

ing Co. v. Hall, 53 Okla. 760. Mallen v. Ruth Oil Co.,
230 Fed. 497; affirmed, 231 Fed. 845. The fugitive character of the subject-matter makes it necessary in the
ward's interest that guardians should have that power,
and it appears to us that it would be an extravagant
interpretation of the Constitution to hold that the ward's
interest must be sacrificed on the ground of the absolute
character of his title when adult. He takes that title
subject to such qualifications as the law reasonably allows
to be imposed for his good. The denial of the power as
.to agricultural (Haddock v. Bronaugh, 92 Okla. 197) or
coal lands (Tierney Coal Co. v. Smith, 180 Ky. 815)
whether right or wrong on constitutional grounds, cannot
be extended to this case.
It is not open to dispute that the removal by the later
Act of Congress that we have cited of the restriction upon
alienation previously imposed is valid. Williams v.
Johnson, 239 U. S. 414, 420. Egan v. McDonald, 246
U. S. 227, 229. Fink v. County Commissioners, 248
U. S. 399, 404.
It is admitted that if we follow the decisions of the
Supreme Court of Oklahoma, both those that we have
cited and others, the guardian did not have to follow the
procedure prescribed for the sale of a ward's real estate.
Duff v. Keaton, 33 Okla. 92. PapooseOil Co. v. Swindler,
95 Okla. 264. See also Jackson v. Gates Oil Co., 297 Fed.
549. Clayton v. Tibbens, 298 Fed. 18, affirming 288 Fed.
393. But it is argued here that under Kuhn v. Fairmont
Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, this Court is not bound by the
State decisions and may judge for itself, inasmuch as,
whatever may be the rule of property now, Duff v. Keaton was decided after these leases were made. It would
seem from the cases cited that the present rule had been
followed and great interests established on the faith of it
before Duff v. Keaton. But apart from that consideration no case yet has gone to the length of undertaking

to correct the construction of State laws by State courts.
The exclusive authority to enact those laws carries with
it final authority to say what they mean. The construction of those laws by the Supreme Court of the State is
as much the act of the State, as the enactment of them
by the legislature. If we thought the decisions cited far
more questionable than we do, we nevertheless should
bow to them as binding upon a matter of local administration and of only local concern. The counsel for the
appellants presented a very thorough and well stated
argument, but failed to make us doubt that the decree
must be affirmed.
Decree affirmed.
