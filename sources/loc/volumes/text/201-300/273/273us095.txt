CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 85. Argued November 24, 1926.-Decided January 3, 1927.
Samples of intoxicating liquor constituting part of a quantity seized
by federal officers under a valid search warrant may consistently
with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments be used as evidence against
the occupant of the premises, in a prosecution under the Prohibition Act, even though when they made the seizure the officers
unlawfully destroyed the remainder of the liquor, and even assum-

ing that, by so doing, they became civilly liable as trespassers
ab initio. P. 97.
ANSWER to questions propounded by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, 6 Fed. (2d) 276, upon review of a conviction
of McGuire in the District Court for a violation of the
Prohibition Act. 300 Fed. 98.

Mr. Ransom H. Gillett for the plaintiff in error.
Congress never intended to authorize government officers to summarily destroy either liquor or any other kind
of property which they seized when acting under the
authority conferred upon them by a search warrant.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

McGuire was convicted in the District Court for northern New York of the crime of possessing intoxicating
liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act. 300
Fed. 98. On review of the judgment of conviction, the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified to this
Court two questions concerning which it desires instructions. 6 Fed. (2d) 576, § 239 Jud. Code.
The certificate states that before the filing of the information on which McGuire was convicted, a search warrant was issued by a United States Commissioner com-

manding certain revenue agents to enter and search described premises for liquors alleged to be possessed by
McGuire. The officers named, acting under the warrant,
searched the premises, discovering several gallons of intoxicating liquor which they seized. While there, they
destroyed without court order or other legal authority all
the seized liquor except one quart of whiskey and one
quart of alcohol, which they retained as evidence. On the
trial the liquor retained was received in evidence over the
objection that it was inadmissible because of the destruction of the other liquor. The questions certified are:
" 1st. Were the officers of the law by reason of their
action in destroying the liquors seized trespassers ab
initio?
"If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative,
we ask
"2d. Was the admission in evidence of the samples of
liquor unlawful?"
* It is contended that the officers by destroying the seized
liquor became trespassers ab initio; that they thus lost
the protection and authority conferred upon them by
the search warrant; that therefore the seizure of the
liquor, both that destroyed and that retained as evidence,
was illegal and prohibited by the Fourth Amendment;
and that the reception of the liquor in evidence violated
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.
This conclusion has received some support in judicial
decisions. United States v. Cooper, 295 Fed. 709; cf.
Godat v. McCarthy, 283 Fed. 689. But the weight of
authority is against it. Hurley v. United States, 300 Fed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

273 U. S.

That the destruction of the liquor by the officers was in
itself an illegal and oppressive act is conceded.' But it
does not follow that the seizure of the liquor which was
retained violated constitutional immunities of the defendant or that the evidence was improperly received. The
arguments advanced in behalf of the accused concern primarily the personal liability of the officers making the
search and seizure for their unlawful destruction of a part
of the liquor seized. They have at most a remote and
artificial bearing upon the right of the government to
introduce in evidence the liquor seized under a proper
warrant.
The doctrine of trespass ab initio, chiefly relied upon,
is usually traced to the case of the Six Carpenters,8 Coke
146(a). There, in a civil action for trespass, the principle
was announced that where one enters the premises of
another under authority of law, his subsequent misconduct while there taints the entry from the beginning with
illegality. See as to the origin of the rule, Commonwealth
v. Rubin, 165 Mass. 453, 455. This fiction, obviously invoked in support of a policy of penalizing the unauthorized acts of those who had entered under authority of
'Section 25 of the National Prohibition Act provides for the issuance of search warrants pursuant to the requirements of Title XI of
the Espionage Act; June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 228-230, and that
seized property "be subject to such disposition as the court may
make thereof." The Espionage Act regulates the issuance, execution
and return of warrants. If the grounds on which the warrant was
issued be controverted, a hearing before a judge or commissioner must
be held (§ 15); and the property returned if erroneously taken. But
if the warrant properly issued and the property seized was that
described in the warrant, "then the judge or commissioner shall order
the same retained in the custody of the person seizing it or to be
otherwise disposed of according to law" (§ 16). "An officer who in
executing a search warrant wilfully exceeds his authority or exercises
it with unnecessary severity, shall be fined not more than $1000 or
imprisoned not more than one year" (§ 21),.

Opinion of the Court.

law, has only been applied as a rule of liability in civil
actions against them. Its extension is not favored. See
Salmond, Law of Torts, 5th Ed. § 54; Jeremiah Smith,
Surviving Fictions, 27 Yale Law Journal, 147, 164, et seq.
Thus it has been held to have no application in criminal
actions against the trespasser. State v. Moore, 12 N. I.
42. Nor does the unlawful distraint or attachment of
certain articles make unlawful the seizure of property
otherwise rightfully taken at the same time. Harvey
v. Pocock, 11 M. & W. 740; Wentworth v. Sawyer, 76 Me.
434, 441; Cone v. Forest, 126 Mass. 97, 101; cf. Dod v.
Monger, 6 Mod. 215.
Even if the officers were liable as trespassers ab initio,
which we do not decide, we are concerned here not with
their liability but with the interest of the Government in
securing the benefit of the evidence seized, so far as may
be possible without sacrifice of the immunities guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. A criminal
prosecution is more than a game in which the Government
may be checkmated and the game lost merely because its
officers have not played according to rule. The use by
prosecuting officers of evidence illegally acquired by others
does not necessarily violate the Constitution nor affect
its admissibility. Cf. Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S.
465; Adams v. New York, 192 U. S. 585; Weeks v. United
States, 232 U. S. 383, 398. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments protect every person from the invasion of his home
by federal officials without a lawful warrant and from
incrimination by evidence procured as a result of the invasion. Weeks v. United States, supra; Gouled v. United
States, 255 U. S. 298; Agnello v. United-States, 269 U. S.
20; Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313; cf. Silverthorne
Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385. Here there
was no such invasion. The seizure of the liquor received
in evidence was in fact distinct from the destruction of
the rest. Its validity so far as the government is con-

cerned should be equally distinct. We can impute to the
one the illegality of the other only by resorting to a fiction
whose origin, history, and purpose do not justify its application where the right of the government to make use of
evidence is involved.
It follows that neither the seizure of this liquor nor its
use as evidence infringed any constitutional immunity of
the accused. In this view of the case, the answer to the
second question in the certificate is not dependent upon
the answer to the first which pertains to the personal
liability of the officers. Interpreting the second question
as an inquiry whether the samples of intoxicating liquor
should have been excluded as evidence, the answer is
No.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER concurs in the result.

v.

UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 90. Submitted December 9, 1926.-Decided January 3, 1927.
In the provision in the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, imposing a
stamp tax of two cents per "$100 of face value or fraction thereof"
on transfers of the legal title to shares or certificates of stock,
"face value" is synonymous with par value. The par value fixed
by the corporate charter at the time of transfer of a certificate is
the true par value and must control, in assessment of the tax, over
any different par value stated on the face of the certificate. P. 102.
