to correct the construction of State laws by State courts.
The exclusive authority to enact those laws carries with
it final authority to say what they mean. The construction of those laws by the Supreme Court of the State is
as much the act of the State, as the enactment of them
by the legislature. If we thought the decisions cited far
more questionable than we do, we nevertheless should
bow to them as binding upon a matter of local administration and of only local concern. The counsel for the
appellants presented a very thorough and well stated
argument, but failed to make us doubt that the decree
must be affirmed.
Decree affirmed.

of Claims, before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936. The suit was brought
under the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272,
by a manufacturer of clothing to recover the actual loss
incurred in renting and equipping a factory required, during the World War, in order to make uniforms for the
Government, and for which factory there was no use after
the armistice. The claim, as alleged in the petition, is
that the depot quartermaster at Philadelphia agreed that
if the plaintiff would rent and equip the factory, "the
United States, through the Secretary of War, and the contracting officer, the Depot Quartermaster, would award
sufficient contracts to plaintiff, which, at a fair margin
over cost, would enable it to amortize the cost of said
lease, machinery and equipment," and that if sufficient
contracts were not awarded to amortize the plant, the
United States would save plaintiff harmless from any loss.
The Court of Claims did not find as a fact that any
such contract express or implied was made. It found that
the depot quartermaster, while urging plaintiff to rent
and equip the factory, "stated [orally] that contracts
would be placed with plaintiff which would fully reimburse it for the proposed expenditure." The court concluded, as matter of law, that there was no contract; that,
if the contract had in fact been made as alleged, it would
not have bound the Government, because, so far as the
record disclosed, the depot quartermaster had no authority so to bind it; and that, as there was no agreement,
and also because such authority was lacking, the Dent Act
did not afford a remedy, 60 Ct. Cls. 97.
The contracts for uniforms given the plaintiff were
cancelled by the Government. The right to cancel these
is not questioned; and no claim is made here for compensation for cancelling them. Compare Russell Motor
Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514; College Point
Boat Co. v. United States, 267 U. S. 12, 15. The argu-

ment here consisted mainly of an effort to show, by reference in the brief to portions of the evidence introduced
before the Court of Claims, that the contract sued on was
made as alleged and that authority to make it had been
conferred upon the depot quartermaster. The evidence is
not before us; and we must accept the findings of the
Court of Claims. Rogers v. United States, 270 U. S. 154,
162. Moreover, it is doubtful whether even express authorization could, under the then existing statutes, have
conferred upon anyone the power to make the contract
which the plaintiff has attempted to prove. See Rev.
Stat. ยง 3732, as amended by Act of June 12, 1906, c. 3078,
34 Stat. 240, 255; Rev. Stat. ยง 3709, Act of July 5, 1884,
c. 217, 23 Stat. 107, 109; Act of March 2, 1901, c. 803, 31
Stat. 895, 905.
The decision of the lower court was clearly correct.
The Dent Act gave a remedy upon contracts irregularly
made, not upon contracts made without authority. Nor
did it give a cause of action on dealings which did not
ripen into a contract. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v.
United States, 261 U. S. 385; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co.
v. United States, 261 U. S. 592, 596. Compare Price Fire
& Waterproofing Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 179;
United States Bedding Co. v. United States, 266 U. S. 491,
492; Merritt v. United States, 267 U. S. 338, 340.
Affirmed.
