WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.

No. 117. Argued January 4, 1927.-Decided March 7, 1927.
1. An action for damages may be maintained against judges of election for unlawfully denying to a qualified voter the right to vote

at a state primary election. P. 540.
2. A state statute (Texas, 1923, Art. 3093-a) barring negroes from

ERROR to a judgment of the District Court which dismissed an action for damages brought by a negro against
judges of election in Texas, based on their refusal to permit the plaintiff to vote at a primary election.

Cobb, and Robert J. Channell were on the briefs, for

The primary was a public election under the Constitution and laws of the State. Section 8 of Art. 5 of
that Constitution provides that the District Court shall
have original jurisdiction of contested elections. This
provision has been held by the courts of Texas to confer
upon 'the District Court jurisdiction over contested primary elections. Ashford v. Gooduin, 103 Tex. 491;

stitution, and the immunity against discrimination on
account of race or color which is guaranteed by said
Amendment protects the plaintiff in his right to vote in
such primary, where the only obstacle interposed is that
he is anegro. Rev. Stats. §§ 1978, 2004; Guinn v. United

Love v. Griffith, 266 U. S. 32.
When the negro, by virtue of the Fifteenth Amendment, acquired immunity from discrimination in voting
on account of his race and color, he thereby acquired the
right and privilege as a free man to exercise, to the same
extent as a white man, his untrammeled choice in the
selection of parties or candidates; and when the legislature of a State, solely because of his race and color, undertakes by law to exclude him from any party, or deny
him the same latitude in registering his preference as a
member of any party of his choice that it allows to white
members of such party, it thereby abridges his right to
vote under the Amendment, and denies to him the equal
protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214;

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Argument for the State of Texas.

273 U. S.

The nominating primary of a political party is not
an election in which everyone may vote.
There are many organized groups of persons, voluntary
in character, in the several States of the Union. In many
of these the election of officers and the purposes and
objects of the organization depend upon the votes of the
individual members. Some of these are maintained for
charitable purposes, some for the support of religious
worship, some for the diffusion of knowledge and the extension of education, some for the promotion of peace,
and some for the advancement of political ideas. It
clearly appears, therefore, that the right to vote referred
to in constitutions, and elections mentioned therein, do
not include within their scope all elections and all voting
by persons in the United States. The act of the legislature of Texas and the nominating primary in which the
vote of plaintiff in error was refused, dealt only with
voting within a designated political party, which is but
the instrumentality of a group of individuals for the
furtherance of their own political ideas.
It must be remembered that "nominating primaries"
were unknown at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States and of the Constitution of
Texas in 1876. The nominating primary, like its predecessors, the nominating convention and the caucus, is not

The question of parties and their regulation is a political one rather than legal. The District Court of the
United States has no jurisdiction in a case of this character. Political questions are not within its province.

Because the Democratic party holds a nominating
primary, can it be contended that outsiders can be forced
upon the party over its expressed dissent? If the party
should abandon the primary and go back to the conven-

tion or the caucus system, could it be consistently maintained that the courts could force upon the convention
or upon the caucus, the plaintiff in error, if the membership of the party, the convention or the caucus were restricted against negroes? We contend that a nominating
primary is purely a political matter and outsiders denied
participation by the party councils cannot demand a
redress at the hands of the courts. Waples v. Marrast,
108 Tex. 11. Distinguishing, Love v. Griffith, 266 U. S. 32.
Chandlerv. Neff, 298 Fed. 515, disposed of a case almost
identical with this one, and holds with the Supreme Court
of Texas that a primary of a political party is not an
election, and the right of a citizen to vote therein is not
within the protection of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.
Nor is this doctrine limited to Texas. Riter v. Douglass,

MR. JUSTICE HOLmES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an action against the Judges of Elections for
refusing to permit the plaintiff to vote at a primary election in Texas. It lays the damages at five thousand dollars. The petition alleges that the plaintiff is a negro, a
citizen of the United States and of Texas and a resident
of El Paso, and in every way qualified to vote, as set forth
in detail, except that the statute to be mentioned interferes with his right; that on July 26, 1924, a primary
election was held at El Paso for the nomination of candidates for a senator and representatives in Congress and
State and other offices, upon the Democratic ticket; that

the plaintiff, being a member of the Democratic party,
sought to vote but was denied the right by defendants;
that the denial was based upon a Statute of Texas enacted in May, 1923, and designated Article 3093a, by the
words of which "in no event shall a negro be eligible to
participate in a Democratic party primary election held in
the State of Texas," &c., and that this statute is contrary
to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The defendants moved to
dismiss upon the ground that the subject matter of the
suit was political and not within the jurisdiction of the
Court and that no violation of the Amendments was
shown. The suit was dismissed and a writ of error was
taken directly to this Court. Here no argument was made
on behalf of the defendants but a brief was allowed to be
filed by the Attorney General of the State.
The objection that the subject matter of the suit is
political is little more than a play upon words. Of course
the petition concerns political action but it alleges and
seeks to recover for private damage. That private damage
may be caused by such political action and may be recovered for in a suit at law hardly has been doubted for
over two hundred years, since Ashby v. White, 2 Ld.
Raym. 938, 3 id. 320, and has been recognized by this
Court. Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U. S. 58, 64, 65. Giles v.
Harris, 189 U. S. 475, 485. See also Judicial Code, § 24
(11), (12), (14). Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231; 36 Stat.
1087, 1092. If the defendants' conduct was a wrong to the
plaintiff the same reasons that allow a recovery for denying the plaintiff a vote at a final election allow it for denying a vote at the primary election that may determine the
final result.
The important question is whether the statute can be
sustained. But although we state it as a question the
answer does not seem to us open to a doubt. We find it
unnecessary to consider the Fifteenth Amendment, be-

cause it seems to us hard to imagine a more direct and
obvious infringement of the Fourteenth. That Amendment, while it applies to all, was passed, as we know, with

a special intent to protect the blacks from discrimination
against them. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36.
Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303. That Amendment "not only gave citizenship and the privileges of
citizenship to persons of color, but it denied to any State
th- power to withhold from them the equal protection of
the laws. . . . What is this but declaring that the law
in the States shall be the same for the black as for the
white: that all persons, whether colored or white, shall
stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard
to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment
was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be
made against them by law because of their color?"
Quoted from the last case in Buchanan v. Warley, 245
U. S. 60, 77. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 374.
The statute of Texas in the teeth of the prohibitions referred to assumes to forbid negroes to take part in a primary election the importance of which we have indicated,
discr'minating against them by the distinction of color
alone. States may do a good deal of classifying that it is
difficult to believe rational, but there are limits, and it is
too clear for extended argument that color cannot be made
the basis of a statutory classification affecting the right
