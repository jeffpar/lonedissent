No. 270. Argued March 5, 1930.-Deciaeu April 14, 1930.
1. A suit to enjoin the collection of a state tax, as violative of the
Fourteenth Amendment, upon the ground that the taxing officials,
in making the assessment, arbitrarily and intentionally valued the
plaintiff's property much above its true value, while assessing all
other property in the county at only 60% of true value, will not
lie in the federal court if the plaintiff has a plain, adequate and
complete remedy at law. Jud. Code ยง 267; U. S. C., Title 28, ยง 384.

280 U. S. 541, to review a decree of .the

Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed a decree of the
District Court dismissing a bill to enjoin the collection of
a state tax.
Mr. Willis Smith, with whom Messrs. Murray Allen
and W. T. Joyner were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Clyde R. Hoey, with whom Messrs. Fred D. Hamrick, N. C. Harris, and J. S. Dockery were on the brief,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The Henrietta Mills, a corporation of North Carolina,
brought this suit in the District Court of the United
States to enjoin Rutherford County, in that State, from
collecting a tax upon the property of the corporation for
the year 1927, or for any subsequent year, based upon
any valuation in excess of sixty per cent. of the actual
and fair market value. It was alleged that the enforcement of such a tax would deprive the corporation of its
property without due process of law and deny the equal
protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth
Amenalment of the Federal Constitution.
The bill of complaint charged that the actual value, in
the sense of the applicable statutory provision of the
State, of the property of the corporation in Rutherford

Opinion of the Court.

County on May 1, 1927, did not exceed $1,887,352, but
that the property was actually assessed at $2,637,819.
The corporation complained to the County Commissioners, as the constituted Board of Equalization and Review,
but the board declined to pass upon the questions presented. The corporation then appealed to the State
Board of Assessment which, after hearing, reduced the
assessment by the sum of $275,000 and fixed the value
of the property at $2,362,819. The bill alleged that the
tax officials of the county, and of the State, had intentionally and arbitrarily valued the complainant's property greatly in excess of its true value, while at the same
time they had fixed the value of all other assessable
property within the county at only sixty per cent. of its
true value; that the assessment of complainant's property
should have been reduced in like proportion, that is, to
$1,132,411.20; and that the complainant had paid to the
county a sum which would be equal to the tax if laid
upon such a valuation.
The answer denied that there had been any arbitrary
and intentional overvaluation, or any unlawful discrimination against the complainant, and alleged that the complainant had an adequate remedy at law.
The District Court decided against the complainant
upon both these grounds and dismissed the bill of complaint.. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. 32 F. (2d) 570.
Section 16 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 82)
provided "That suits in equity shall not be sustained in
either of the courts of the United States, in any case
where a plain, adequate and complete remedy may be had
at law." This explicit prohibition, continued in section
723 of the Revised Statutes and section 267 of the Judicial
Code (U. S. C., Tit. 28, sec. 384), has clear application
to proceedings to enjoin the collection of taxes upon the
ground that they.are illegal or unconstitutional. It must

appear that the enforcement of the tax would cause irreparable injury, or that there are other special circumstances bringing the case under some recognized head of
equity jurisdiction, before the aid of a Federal court of
equity can be invoked. The mere fact that the validity
of the tax may be tested more conveniently by a bill in
equity than by an action at law does not justify resort to
the former.1
In the present case, a distinction is sought to be taken
upon the ground that'a statute of North Carolina gives
a right to proceed in equity, and it is argued that a similar
right should be recognized by the Federal court. Section
7979 of the Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina
provides:
"Unless a tax or assessment, or some part thereof, be
illegal or invalid, or be levied or assessed for an illegal
or unauthorized purpose, no injunction shall be granted
by any court or judge to restrain the collection thereof
in whole or in part, nor to restrain the sale of any property
for the non payment thereof; nor shall any court issue
any order in claim and delivery proceedings or otherwise
for the taking of any personalty levied on by the sheriff
to enforce payment of such tax or assessment against the

owner thereof. Whenever any person shall claim to have
a valid defense to the enforcement of a tax or assessment
charged or assessed upon his property or poll, such person
shall pay such tax or assessment to the sheriff; but if,
at the time of such payment, he shall notify the sheriff
in writing that he pays !he same under protest, such payment shall be without prejudice to any defenses or rights
he may have in the premises, and he may, at any time
within thirty days after such payment, demand the same
in writing from the treasurer of the state or of the county,
city, or town, for the benefit or under the authority or
by request of which the same was levied; and if the same
shall not be refunded within ninety days thereafter, may
sue such county, city, or town for the amount so demanded, including in his action against the county both
state and county tax; and if upon the trial it shall be
determined that such tax or any part thereof was levied
or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, or was
for any reason invalid or excessive, judgment shall be
rendered therefor, with interest, and the same shall be
collected as in other cases. The amount of state taxes
for which judgment shall be rendered in such action shall
be refunded by the state treasurer." (Laws of 1901, c.

558, ยง 30.)
The Supreme Court of North Carolina, in NorfolkSouthern Railroad Company v. Board of Commissioners,
188 N. C. 265, 266, made the following statement as to the
procedure in the state courts:
"In this jurisdiction, a taxpayer may contest the
validity of an assessment or collection of tax upon his
property in one of two ways:
"(1) He may pay the alleged illegal or invalid tax under
protest and then bring an action to recover it back, observing, of course, the requirements of the statute with
respect to time, notice, etc. C. S. 7979. Murdock v.

845; Schaul v. Charlotte, 118 N. C. 733; Range Co. v.
Carver, 118 N. C. 328.
"(2) He may, if the tax or assessment, or some part
thereof, be illegal or invalid, or be levied or assessed for
an illegal or unauthorized purpose, apply for injunctive
relief without paying the alleged illegal or invalid tax in
advance. C. S. 858;2 Sherrod v. Dawson, 154 N. C. .525;
Lumber Co. v. Smith, 146 N. C. 199; Purnell v. Page, 133
N. C. 129."
If it be assumed that, under the state statutes, the
complainant could have applied to the state court for
an injunction, the complainant also had an adequate remedy at law. Schaul v. Charlotte, 118 N. C. 733; Teeter
v. Wallace, 138 N. C. 264, 267; Blackwell v. City of Gastonia, 181 N. C. 378; Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company v. Mecklenburg County, 181 N. C. 386; Carstarphen
v. Plymouth, 186 N. C. 90. This is not a matter of
doubt, as in Union Pacific Railroad Company v. Weld
County, 247 U. S. 282, 285, and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company v. Daughton, 262 U. S. 413, 426. The act
of Congress with respect to the existence of such a remedy
has reference to the adequacy of the remedy on the law
side of the Federal courts (Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466,
516; Chicago, B. & Q. RailroadCompany v. Osborne, 265
U. S. 14, 16; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Railway CorI
2Section

858 of Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina provides:
"No injunction may be granted by any court or judge to restrain the
collection of any tax or any part thereof, or to restrain the sale of
any property for the non payment of any tax, unless such tax or the
part thereof enjoined is levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized
purpose, or the tax assessment is illegal or invalid."

pany, 270 U. S. 378, 388) and in this case there would
have been an adequate remedy at law, not only in the
state court, but also in the Federal court if petitioner had
been able to show a violation of the Federal Constitution
(Judicial Code, sec." 24).
The contention is that the state statute authorizing a
proceeding in the state court for an injunction created an
equitable right which should be enforced in the Federal
court. It is true that where a state statute creates a new
equitable right of a substantive character, which can be
enforced by proceedings in conformity with the pleadings
and practice appropriate to a court of equity, such enforcement may be had in a Federal court provided a
ground exists for invoking the Federal jurisdiction. Clark
v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195, 203; In re Broderick's Will, 21 Wall.
503, 520; Holland v. Challen, 110 U. S. 15, 24, 25; Frost
v. Spitley, 121 U. S. 552, 557; Gormley v. Clark, 134 U. S.
338, 348; Lawson v. United States Mining Company, 207
U. S. 1, 9; Pusey & Jones Company v. Hanssen, 261 U. S.
491, 498. But the enforcement in the Federal courts of
new equitable rights created by States is subject to the
qualification that such enforcement must not impair any
right conferred, or conflict with any inhibition imposed,
by the Constitution or laws of the United States. This
Court said in Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106, 110, that
"whenever, respecting any right violated, a court of law
is competent to render a judgment affording a plain,
adequate and complete remedy, the party aggrieved must
seek his remedy in such court, not only because the defendant has a constitutional right to a trial by jury, but
because of the prohibition of the act of Congress to pursue
his remedy in such cases in a court of equity." Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U. S. 146, 152; Wehrman v. Conklin,
155 U. S. 314, 323. Whatever uncertainty may have
arisen because of expressions which did not fully accord

with the rule as thus stated,' the distinction, with respect
to the effect of state legislation, has come to be clearly
established between substantive and remedial rights. A
state statute of a mere remedial character, such as that
which the petitioner invokes, can not enlarge the right
to proceed in a Federal court sitting in equity, and the
Federal court may, therefore, be obliged to deny an
equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have had in
a state court. Pusey & Jones v. Hanssen, supra.
The provision of the act of Congress does not extend
to the jurisdiction of the Federal court, but governs the
proceedings in equity and, unless the case is one where
the objection may be treated as. waived by the party entitled to raise it, the prohibition is not to be disregarded.

Machine Company v. Benedict, 229 U. S. 481, 484; American Mills Company v. American Surety Company, 260
U. S. 360, 363. There was no waiver in the present case
and, as the petitioner had an adequate remedy at law,.
the District Court could not properly entertain the suit.
