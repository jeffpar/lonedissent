by stock set aside and earmarked as such. The material
is all commingled and is indiscriminately used in production, as and when needed. No reason is given for excepting 5,554 tons-no more and no less. To draw an
artificial line at that amount would distort the computation of income in the accounting periods, although
the errors might be equalized in a series of years. Since
inventories are properly deemed necessary, the exception
of that or any amount is nothing but the use of the
discarded "base stock" method.
The Company's case falls far short of meeting the
heavy burden of proving that the Commissioner's action was plainly arbitrary. Compare Lucas v. American
Code Co., 280 U. S. 445, 449; Williamsport Wire Rope

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 269.

Argued March 5, 1930.-Decided April 14, 1930.

1. The District Court is without jurisdiction to review a decision of

P. 273.
2. Section 19 of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, as amended,
U. S. C., Title 38, § 445, which confers jurisdiction upon the District Courts to hear and determine controversies arising out of

CERTIORARI,

Mr. Charles Kerr presented the oral argument, and
Messrs. Jean S. Breitenstein, S. R. Owens, and Lowell D.
Hunt were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Claude R. Branch, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom Attorney General Mitchell and
Messrs. J. Frank Staley and W. Clifton Stone were on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

,delivered twe opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner brought this action against the respondent
in a federal district court to require the reinstatement of
a lapsed insurance policy issued under the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, § 400, 40 Stat.
398, 409; amended August 9, 1921, c. 57, § 27, 42 Stat.
147, 156, 157. It was alleged that, being enlisted in the
United States army during the World War, he applied
for and obtained, under the act, a policy of insurance
in the sum of $10,000 against death and permanent and
total disability. Thereafter, on February 1, 1920, $3,000
of this amount was converted into a 20-payment life
policy, and the remaining $7,000 was allowed to lapse. In
March, 1923, petitioner applied to the Director of the
United States Veterans' Bureau for reinstatement of the
policy in respect of the $7,000, asserting that he was then
suffering from a disability of a degree less than permanent
and total. The director of the bureau rejected the ap-

plication and thereupon petitioner brought this action.>
The government answered, denying certain allegations
and admitting others,, and alleging that at the time of
the application for reinstatement, and for a long time
prior thereto, petitioner was permanently and totally
disabled.
The case was tried by the court without a jury, and
judgment rendered reinstating the policy to the extent
of $7,000. The circuit court of appeals reversed the judgment upon the ground that the trial court was without
jurisdiction, and directed a dismissal of the petition. 32
F. (2d) 440.
Prior to the amending act of 1921, there was no statutory provision for the reinstatement of lapsed policies,
but the matter was one of bureau regulation. By § 408
of that act, carried into the act of 1924 as § 304, c. 320,
43 Stat. 607, 625 (U. S. Code, Title 38, § 515), it was
provided:
"In the event that all provisions of the rules and regulations other than the requirements as to the physical
condition of the applicant for insurance have been complied with, an application for reinstatement, in whole or
in part, of lapsed or canceled yearly renewable term
insurance or United States Government life insurance
(converted insurance) hereafter made may be approved
if made within one year after the passage of this Act or
within two years after the date of lapse or cancellation:
... Provided further, That the applicant during his
lifetime submits proof satisfactory to the director showing . . . that the applicant is not totally and permanently disabled."
The director denied the application on the ground that
the applicant, at the time of making it, was totally and
permanently disabled. The trial court held the contrary. The evidence upon which the director acted was

not before the court, but the case was decided upon original evidence introduced upon the trial. The question
was purely one of fact, which the director was authorized
to determine; and his decision, unless within § 19 of the
World War Veterans' Act of 1924, dealt with below, was
final and conclusive. United States -. Williams, 278
U. S. 255; Silberschein v. United States, 266 U. S. 221,
225,
Section 19 of the act of 1924, as amended March 4,
1925, c. 553, § 2, 43 Stat. 1302 (U. S. Code, Title 38,
§ 445), provides in part:
"In the event of disagreement as to claim under a contract of insurance between the Bureau and any person
or persons claiming thereunder an action on the claim may
be brought against the United States either in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia or in the District Court of the United States in and for the district
in which such persons or any one of them resides, and
jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such courts to hear
and determine all such controversies."
This provision, we think, has nothing to do with an
application for reinstatement of a defunct policy. The
right to reinstatement, when it exists, flows from the
statutory provision and not from any undertaking expressed in the contract of insurance. No doubt, the policy holder may have the benefit of the statute, although
passed subsequently to the issue of the policy, White v.
United States, 270 U. S. 175, 180; but a reinstatement
under the provisions of the statute would be not the fulfillment of a contractual obligation but, in effect, the
making of a new contract by statutory sanction.
Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, 266 U. S. 389, upon
which petitioner here relies, is not to the contrary. There
the original policy of insurance was a seven-year term

policy. It provided expressly that upon any anniversary
of its date, at the sole option of the insured, without
medical reexamination, it was convertible into a twenty
payment life commercial policy, etc. It was held that
the converted policy was merely a continuation of the
old one. This court said (p. 399):
"In effect, it is as though the first policy had provided
that upon demand of the insured and payment of the
stipulated increase in premiums that policy should, autoinatically, become a twenty payment life commercial
policy. It was issued not as the result of any new negotiation or agreement but in discharge of pre~xisting obligations. It merely fulfilled promises then outstanding;
and did not arise from new or additional promises. The
result in legal contemplation was not a novation but the
consummation of an alternative specifically accorded by,
and enforceable in virtue of, the original contract. If the
insurance company had refused to issue the second policy
upon demand, the insured could have compelled it by a
suit in equity for specific performance."
The situation in the present case is altogether different.
The original policy had come to an end; liability under
it had wholly ceased; a new application was required,
together with proof of an existing condition sufficient to
satisfy the director, before reinstatement could be made.
The effect of the statute is to accord the privilege of reinstatement to the holder of a lapsed policy, not to read
into it a promise to that end. The existence of the old
policy is, of course, a necessary prerequisite to the consideration of a claim for the allowance of the statutory
privilege, but the claim is one under the statute, not under
the contract, and, consequently, does not fall within the
terms of § 19.
Judgment affirmed.
