provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory
arrangements and contracts however skilfully devised to
prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it. That seems to us the
import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to
the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a
different tree from that on which they grew.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 250.

Argued February 28, 1930.-Decided April 14, 1930.

1. Reasonable compensation allowed by the board of directors of a
corporation to its officers in addition to their salaries, for valuable
services rendered by them to the corporation, held deductible in
computing the net income of the corporation, under ยง 234 (a)' (1)
of the Revenue Act of 1918, which permits deduction of "All the
ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered." P. 117.
2. Such additional compensation, though made for services rendered
in previous years, is deductible from the income of the taxable year
in which it was allowed and paid if there was no prior agreement
or legal obligation to pay it. P. 119.
3. Section 212 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1918, which provides that
the net income shall be computed upon the basis of the taxpayer's
accounting period in accordance with the method of accounting
regularly employed in keeping the taxpayer's books, but that if such
method does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall
be made upon such basis and in such manner as in the opinion of
the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income, does not justify

Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed a decision of the
Board of Tax Appeals sustaining a determination of a
defieiency in the income tax of the respondent corporation.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Messrs. J. Louis Monarch and Morton Poe Fisher, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, Clarence M.
Charest, General Counsel, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
and John MacC. Hudson, Special Attorney, Bureau of
Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Harry B. Sutter, with whom Messrs. Albert L.
Hopkins, Edward H. McDermott, and 0. John Rogge
were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. CHIEF JusTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
The Ox Fibre Brush Company appealed to the Board
of Tax Appeals from the determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of a deficiency in the income
tax of the corporation for the year 1920. The Board of
Tax Appeals sustained the ruling of the Commissioner
(8 B. T. A. 422), and this decision was reversed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 32 F. (2d) 42.
The question relates to extra compensation granted by
the directors of the corporation in the year 1920 to the
president and treasurer, of $24,000 each. In the income
tax return for that year, the corporation deducted these
items from the gross income and the Commissioner of

LUCAS v. OX FIBRE BRUSH CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction. The Board
of Tax Appeals held that, if the additional compensation
was given for services performed in prior years, it was
not deductible in the year 1920; and if, as the Board concluded, it was allowed for services rendered in 1920, it was
in excess of reasonable compensation for that year and
hence could not be deducted.
The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the conclusion
of the Board of Tax Appeals that the additional compensation was allowed for services performed in the year
1920 was without evidence to support it; that the compensation was for past.services. It was further decided
that the amount of the additional payment was reasonable in the circumstances shown and was deductible in
the return for 1920, the year in which it was allowed and
paid.
From the facts as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
it appears that the president of the corporation had been
in office from 1906 and its treasurer from 1907. Both of
these officers had devoted their entire time to the interests
of the corporation. Each year they had personally guaranteed bank loans to the corporation of considerable
amounts. In addition to their ordinary executive duties,
the president and treasurer had charge of all large purchases, of all sales, and had directed the general policies
of the corporation. Prior to their administration, the
business of the corporation had been in a chaotic state
and had been conducted at a loss, but under their management the gross sales had increased from about $374,000
in 1909 to $1,273,000 in 1920. The net results were
changed from an operating loss of about $4,000 in 1908
to net earnings (after deduction of salaries, including the
amounts here in question) of about $158,000 in 1920.
No dividends were paid until 1910, but dividends were
increased from $4,500 in 1911 and 1912 to $423,275 in

1920, represented by a fifty per cent. stock dividend of
$300,000 and cash dividends aggregating $123,275, or
25.98 per cent. on the outstanding capitalization at the
beginning of that year. The net income in 1920, after
a deduction of all expenses, including officers' salaries,
represented a return of 21.13 per cent. on invested capital
of about $750,000, as determined by the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue. The corporation had advanced to
a leading place in the brush trade. In 1919 and 1920,
the president and treasurer had received salaries of $12,000
and $15,000, respectively. In 1918 their combined salaries were approximately $25,000. The record does not
disclose what they received in 1915, 1916 and 1917, but
in 1914 they together received $16,000; in 1913, $11,000;
in the three preceding years, $10,000, and before that time
they received $6,000.
On May 6, 1920, the board of directors unanimously
voted to pay to each of these officers $24,000, the resolution in each case explicitly stating that it was paid "as
extra compensation for his past services to this company
as an officer thereof and in any other capacity."
The books of the corporation were kept on an accrual
basis, and during May, 1920, proper entry was made crediting the accounts of the president and treasurer with the
additional compensation thus voted.
It is unnecessary to review the facts more in detail,
as the Government, adopting the view that the additional
compensation, as stated in the resolution of the board of
directors and as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
was for services performed in prior years, concedes on
behalf of the Commissioner that the payments were
reasonable for such services. The sole question, therefore,
which the Government presents is whether these payments were properly deductible in the return for the
year 1920.

LUCAS v. OX FIBRE BRUSH CO.
115

Opinion of the Court.

The statute applicable to the return is the Revenue
Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. Section 234 (a) of that
act provides (id. p. 1077):
"Sec. 234. (a) That in computing the net income of
a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230
there shall be allowed as deductions:
"(1) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or
incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade
or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries
or other compensation for personal services actually
rendered, . .."

The payments in the present instance were actually
made in the year 1920. The expenses represented by
these payments were incurred in that year, for it is undisputed that there was no prior agreement or legal obligation to pay the additional compensation. This compensation for past services, it being admitted that it was
Feasonable in amount in view of the large benefits which
the corporation had received as the fruits of these services,
the corporation had a right to pay, if it saw fit. There
is no suggestion of attempted evasion or abuse. The
payments were made as a matter of internal policy having
appropriate regard to the advantage of recognition of
skill and fidelity as a stimulus to continued effort. There
was nothing in the income tax law to preclude such action.
On the contrary, the payments fell directly within the
provision of section 234(a) as a reasonable allowance for
compensation for personal services actually rendered.
The statute does not require that the services should be
actually rendered during the taxable year, but that the
payments therefor shall be proper expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year.
It is urged that under Section 212 (b) of the Revenue
Act of 1918 (id. 1064, 1065) the Commissioner was entitled to disallow the deduction in the return for 1920,

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

upon the ground that if it were allowed the return would
not clearly reflect the income for that year. It is said
that the basic principle to be applied is that the true net
income is to be taxed. Section 212 (b) provides:
"(b) The net income shall be computed upon the basis
of the taxpayer's annual accounting period (fiscal year or
calendar year, as the case may be) in accordance with the
method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the
books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method employed does
not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be
made upon such basis and in such manner as in the
opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the
income.
This section relates to the method of accounting; the
Commissioner may make the computation on a basis that
does clearly reflect the income, if the method employed by
the taxpayer does not. But this section does not justify
the Commissioner in allocating to previous years a reasonable allowance as compensation for services actually rendered, when the compensation was properly paid during
the taxable year and the obligation to pay was incurred
during that year and not previously. In the present
instance, the expense could not be attributed to earlier
years, for it was neither paid nor incurred in those years.
There was no earlier accrual of liability. It was deductible in the year 1920 or not at all. Being deductible as a
reasonable payment, there was no authority vested in the
Commissioner to disregard the actual transaction and to
readjust the income on another basis which did not
respond to the facts.
The case of United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, is
not in point, as there the liability for the munitions tax at
a fixed rate had accrued in the earlier year (1916) and was
a charge on the business of that year, although the precise
amount was ascertained and was payable in 1917. In

COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 270. Argued March 5, 1930.-Deciaeu April 14, 1930.
1. A suit to enjoin the collection of a state tax, as violative of the
Fourteenth Amendment, upon the ground that the taxing officials,
in making the assessment, arbitrarily and intentionally valued the
plaintiff's property much above its true value, while assessing all
other property in the county at only 60% of true value, will not
lie in the federal court if the plaintiff has a plain, adequate and
complete remedy at law. Jud. Code ยง 267; U. S. C., Title 28, ยง 384.
P. 123.
2. It must appear that the enforcement of the tax would cause irreparable injury, or that there are other special circumstances bringing
the case under some recognized head of equity jurisdiction, before
the aid of a federal court of equity can be invoked. P. 124.
3. The mere fact that the validity of the tax may be tested more
conveniently by a bill in equity than by an action at law does not
justify resort to the former. Id.
4. In this case, under ยง 7979, Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina, the taxpayer had an adequate remedy at law by first paying
the tax and then suing to recover it. P. 125.
5. The Act of Congress cited supra has reference to the adequacy of
the remedy on the law side of the federal courts. P. 126.
6. The enforcement in the federal courts of new equitable rights
created by States is subject to the qualification that such enforcement must not impair any right conferred, or conflict with any inhibition imposed, by the Constitution or laws of the United States.
P. 127.
7. A state statute -conferring a merely remedial right to enjoin collection of invalid taxes can not enlarge the right to proceed in a
