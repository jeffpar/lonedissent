LUCAS v. NORTH TEXAS CO.
Syllabus.

which under established practice are taxable as between
party and party. And the opinion makes it clear that
the decree directed to be entered below was intended to
be an end of the whole matter. It is plain that the stockholders' application was denied and that the decree did
not authorize or permit the taxation of costs as between
solicitor and client.
The mandate required the execution of the decree. The
District Court could not vary it or give any further relief.

LUCAS, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. NORTH TEXAS LUMBER COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 92. Argued January 15, 16, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1930.
An option offered by one corporation to another to buy lands at a
specified price was accepted late in 1916 by a notice from the

vendee, in which it declared itself ready to close the transaction and
pay the price as soon as the transfer papers were prepared by the
vendor. The vendor did not prepare the papers, trausfer or tender
title or possession, or demand or receive the purchase price, until
early in 1917, when the transaction was closed. Held that, as
unconditional liability of the vendee was not created in- 1916, the
vendor, though it kept its accounts on the accrual basis, was not

CERTIORARI, 280 U. S. 538, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed an order of the
Board of Tax Appeals, 7 B. T. A. 1193, sustaining a finding
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

Solicitor General Hughes, with whom Assitant Attorney General Youngquist, Messrs. Randolph C. Shaw and
J.Louis Monarch, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, C. M. Charest, General Counsel, and Shelby S.
Faulkner, Special Attorney, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
were on the briefs, for the petitioner.
Mr. Albert B. Hall, with whom Mr. Joseph J. Eckford
was on the brief, submitted for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The respondent, a Texas corporation, for some time
prior to 1917 was engaged in operating a sawmill, selling
lumber and buying and selling timber lands. December
27, 1916, it gave to the Southern Pine Company a ten
day option to purchase its timber lands for a specified
price. The latter was solvent and- able to make the
purchase. On the same day title was examined ajid found
satisfactory to the Pine Company. It arranged for the
money needed and December 30, 1916, notified respondent that it would exercise the option. On that day respondent ceased operations and withdrew all employees
from the land. January 5, 1917, the papers which were
required to effect the transfer were delivered, the purchase price was paid and the transaction was finally
closed.

LUCAS v. NORTH TEXAS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Respondent kept its accounts on the accrual basis and
treated the profits derived from the sale as income in
1916. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the gain had been realized in, and was taxable
for 1917. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained his finding. 11 B. T. A. 1193. The Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the Board. 30 F. (2d) 680.
The gain derived from this sale was taxable income.'
If attributed to 1916 the tax would be much less than if
made in 1917.' Sectiop 13 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1916 provided that a corporation keeping its accounts
upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis failed clearly to reflect
income, might make return upon the basis upon which
its accounts were kept and have the tax computed upon
the income so returned.'
An executory contract of sale was created by the option
and notice, December 30, 1916. In the notice the purchaser declared itself ready to close the transaction and
pay the purchase price "as soon as the papers were prepared." Respondent did not prepare the papers necessary to effect the. transfer or make tender of title oF possession or demand, the purchase price in 1916. The title
and right of possession remained in it until the transaction was closed. Consequently unconditional liability of
vendee for the purchase price was not created in that
year. Gober v. Hart, 36 Texas 139. Cf. United States
v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 441. American National Company v. United States, 274 U. S. 99. The entry of the

year was not warranted. Respondent was not entitled

CHICAGO & NORTH WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. LINDELL.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 193. Argued January 23, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1930.
1. Where the state law permits adjustment of the defendant's demand by counterclaim in the plaintiff's action, its adjustment by
that method rather than by independent r
is to be encouraged
in the federal courts. Pp. 16-17.
2. The practice of determining claims of shippers for loss or damage
in suits brought by carriers to collect the transportation charges,
is not repugnant to the rule of the Hepburn Act prohibiting the
payment of such charges otherwise than in money. P. 17.
3. That Act ought not to be construed to put aside state laws and
long established practice in respect of pleading in the absence of
any plain intention of Congress to do so. P. 18.
ANSWER to a question certified by the Circuit Court of
Appeals upon review of a judgment of the District Court
allowing the loss suffered by the defendant through damage to an interstate shipment to be set off in an action by
the carrier for the transportation charges.
