HOMIE INSURANCE COMPANY ET AL. v. DICK ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS.

No. 232.

Argued February 27, 1930.-Decided May 5, 1930.

A contract of fire insurance issued by a Mexican company, made and
to be performed in Mexico, and covered in part by reinsurance
effected there or in New York with New York companiks licensed to
do business in Texas, was assigned by the insured to a citizen of
Texas who was present in Mexico when the policy issued and continued to reside there until after a loss had occurred. He then returned to Texas and sued on the policy in a Texas Court naming the
Mexican company, which was never present in Texas and did not
appear, as principal defendant, and the two New York companies,
because of their reinsurance liability, as garnishees. The policy
stipulated that no suit should be brought under it unless within one
year of the loss; but a defense based on this was over-ruled by
the Texas Supreme Court and recovery against the garnishees
affirmed, by applying a Texas statute which forbade 'any -agreement limiting the time for suit to a shorter period than two years

and declared that no agreement for such shorter limitation should
ever be valid in that State. Held:
1. The objection that, as applied to contracts made and to be
performed outside of Texas, the statute violates the Federal Constitution, raises federal questions of substance; and the existence
of the federal claim is not disproved by saying that the statute,
or the one year provision in the policy, relates to the remedy and
not to the substance. P. 405.
2. That the federal questions were not raised in the trial court
is immaterial, since the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme
Court of the State considered them as properly raised in the
appellate proceedings and passed on them adversely to the federal
claim. P. 407.
3. The case is properly here on appeal, and petition for certiorari
is therefore denied. Id.
4. The statute as construed and applied deprives the garnishees
of property without due process of law, since the State was without
power, under the circumstances, to affect the terms of the insurance
contract by imposing a greater obligation t' .. that agreed upon
and to seize property in payment of the imposed obligation. Id.
5. When the parties to a contract have expressly agreed upon
a time limit on their obligation, a statute which invalidates the
agreement and directs enforcement of the contract after that time
has expired increases their obligation and imposes a burden not
contracted for. P. 408.
6. The statute as here involved is not one dealing with remedies
and procedure merely; it purports to create rights and obligations.
P. 409.
7. Assuming that a State may properly refuse to recognize
foreign rights that violate its declared policy, or restrict the conduct
of persons within its limits, this does not mean that it may abrogate
the rights of parties beyond its borders having no relation tb anything done or to be done within them. P. 410.

Argument for Appellants.

Messrs. David Rumsey and Mark W. Maclay for ap•pellants.
A limitation on a right created by contract, valid where
made, is a substantive part of the contract and is not
analogous to a general statute of limitation affecting
remedy only. Riddlesbargerv. Hartford Ins. Co., 7 Wall.

Neighbors, 123 Mo. App. 147; Travelers Ins. Co. v. California Ins. Co., 1 N. D. 151.
Where a right is created by a statute which includes a
limitation upon the right, the expiration of the limitation
has the effect not of merely barring the remedy but of extinguishing the right. Davis v. Mills, 194 U. S. 451;
The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199; Phillips v. Grand Trunk
Ry., 236 U. S. 662.
The substantive provision of a contract, valid by the
law of the place where the contract is made and is to be
performed, creates a right of property enforcible in
another jurisdiction, even though the law of the forum
prohibits such a provision. Scudder v. Union Nat'l Bank,

Argument for Appellees.

281 U. S.

The Supreme Court of Texas failed to distinguish between the effect on a contract of adverse public policy of
the place where the contract was to be performed and
adverse public policy of the law of the forum. Distinguishing Knott v. Botany Mills, 179 U. S. 69; Liverpool
Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397; The Fri, 154
Fed. 333, certiorari denied, 210 U. S. 431; The Miguel di
Larrinaga,217 Fed. 678; The Trinacria,42 Fed. 863.
The application of the Texas s tatute to abrogate a
valid provision in a foreign contract impairs the obligation of contract, deprives of property without due process
of law, and denies equal protection of the laws, contrary
to the Constitution of the United States.
The judgment of the Texas courts against the garnishees was rendered without jurisdictk , and, therefore,
deprived them of their property without due process of
law.
At the time of the garnishment there was no debt owing
by the American reinsurance companies to the Mexican
insurance company.
. Assuming that an indebtedness was in existence, it was
not a res within the jurisdiction of the Texas courts.
Mr. John Neethe, with whom Messrs. H. C. Hughes and
John L. Darrouzet were on the brief, for appellees.
This Court has no jurisdiction to revise the questions
passed on by the Supreme Court of Texas.
As the Federal Constitution has no extraterritorial
effect, it will not protect foreign contracts; and particularly is this true when they are in direct conflict with
the law of the State of the forum where they are sought
to be enforced. King v. Cross, 175 U. S. 398; American
Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 353; Aetna

The contractual provision was purely a clause of limitation and applied to the remedy only. In any event the
state courts had a right to so construe the contract.
Even if it should be held that the provision in reference to limitation was a substantive part of the contract,
yet such provision is in direct contravention to the policy
of the State of Texas, as declared by its laws and the decisions thereunder, and the courts of Texas will not be
compelled to enforce any law that is against the public
policy of the State. Smith v. Northern Neck Ass'n, 112

Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S.59.
The appellants have been accorded due process of law
in the courts of Texas. The judgment was rendered in
full compliance with its law and jurisdiction properly and
)awfully acquired over the American insurance companies,
because immediately upon the total loss of the vessel a
debt accrued from the reinsurance companies to the Mexican company and this debt the appellee had a right to
subject to his claim by garnishment in accordance with
the laws of the State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

MR.

JUSTICE BRANDEIS

281 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Dick, a citizen of Texas, brought this action in a court
of that State against Compafiia General Anglo-Mexicana
de Seguros S, A., a Mexican corporation, to recover on a
policy of fire insurance for the total loss of a tug. Jurisdiction was asserted in rem through garnishment, by ancillary writs issued against The Home Insurance Company
and Franklin Fire Insurance Company, which reinsured,
by contracts with the Mexican corporation, parts of the
risk which it had assumed. The garnishees are New York
corporations. Upon them, service was effected by serving
their local agents in Texas appointed pursuant to Texas
statutes, which require the appointment of local agents
by foreign corporations seeking permits to do business
within the State.
The controversy here is wholly between Dick and the
garnishees. The defendant has never been admitted to
do business in Texas; has not done any business there;
and has not authorized anyone to receive service of proces
or enter an appearance for it in this cause. It was cited
by publication,, in accordance with a Texas statute; attorneys were appointed for it by the trial court; and they
filed on its behalf- an answer which denied liability. But
there is no contention that :thereby jurisdiction in personam over it was acquired. Dick's claim is that, since the
obligation of a reinsurer to pay the original insurer arises
upon the happening of the loss and is not conditional
upon prior payment of the loss by the insurer, Allemannia
Fire Insurance Co. v. Firemen's Insurance Co., 209 U. S.
326; Hicks v. Poe, 269 U. S. 118, the New York companies
are indebted to the Mexican company and these debts
are subject to garnishment in a proceeding against the
latter quasi in rem, even though. it is not suable in personam. The garnishees -concede that inability to sue the

Opinion of the Court.

Mexican corporation in Texas, in personam, is not material, if a cause of action against it existed at the time of
garnishment and there was within the State a res belonging to it. But they deny the existence of the cause of
action or of the res.
Their defense rests upon the following facts. This suit
was not commenced till more than one year after the date
of the loss. The policy provided: "It is understood and
agreed that no judicial suit or demand shall be entered
before any tribunal for the collection of any claiun under
this policy, unless such suits or demands are filed within
one year counted as from the date on which such damage
occurs." This provision wps in accord with the Mexican
law to which the policy was expressly made subject.1 It
was issued by the Mexican company in Mexico to one
Bonner, of Tampico, Mexico, and was there duly assigned
to Dick prior to the loss. It covered the vessel only in
certain Mexican waters. The premium was paid in
Mexico; and the loss was "payable in the City of Mexico
in current funds of the United States of Mexico, or their
equivalent elsewhere." 2 At the time the policy was is1 The pclicy contained also the provision: "The present policy is
subjected to the disposition of the Commercial Code, in that it does
not alter or modify the stipulations which that same contains." • The
dispositions of the Commercial Code thus incorporated are: "Article
1038. The rights of action derived from commercial acts shall be subject to prescription in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
Article 1039. The periods fixed for the enforcement of rights of action arising out of commercial acts shall be fatal except restitution
against same is given. Article 1043. One year shall prescribe actions
derived from contracts of life insurance, sea and land."
2 The loss was made payable to Dick and the Texas and Gulf
Steamship Co. as their interests might appear. The Steamship Company and Suderman & Young, Inc., assignee of part of the cause of
action, intervened as plaintiffs and are joined with Dick as appellees.
As there are no rights peculiar to them, they need not be further
referred to, Dick contends that since the policy was payable to the

sued, when it was assigned to him, and until after the
loss, Dick actually resided in Mexico, although his permanent residence was in Texas. The contracts of reinsurance were effected by correspondence between the Mexican company in Mexico and the New York companies in
New York. Nothing thereunder was to be done, or was
in fact done, in Texas.
In the trial court, the garnishees contended that since
the insurance contract was made and was to be performed
in Mexico, and the one year provision was valid by its
laws, Dick's failure to sue within one year after accrual
of the alleged cause of action was a complete defense to
the suit on the policy; that this failure also relieved the
garnishees of any obligation as reinsurers, the same defense being open to them, New York State Marine Ins.
Co. v. Protection Ins. Co., 1 Story 458, 460; and that
they, consequently, owed no debt to the Mexican company subject to garnishment. To this defense, Dick demurred, 'on the ground that Article 5545 of the Texas
Revised Civil Statutes (1925) provides: "No person, firm,
corporation, association or combination of whatsoever
kind shall enter into any stipulation, contract, or agreeTexas and Gulf Steamship Co., the contract was performable in
Texas. The contention is in conflict with the quoted language of the
policy and there is no provision otherwise lending support to the argument. Texas is nowhere mentioned in the policy. Moreover, there
is nothing in the record to show that the Steamship Company's sole
place of business was in Texas. The State courts made no findings
on this claim.
PBesides the defense here discussed the answers both of the Mexican
corporation and of the garnishees alleged: (2) that the suit was not
brought within the period provided by the Commercial Code of
Mexico, and that thereby the right of action was completely barred
upon the expiration of one year; (3) that the policy was void because of plaintiff's misrepresentations as to the value of the
vessel; (4) that the vessel was not a total loss and was abandoned in
violation of the terms of the policy. None of these defenses needs to
be considered.

HOME INS. CO. v. DICK.

Opinion of the Court.

ment, by reason whereof the time in which to sue thereon
is limited to a shorter period than two years. And no
stipulation, contract, or agreement for any such shorter
limitation in which to sue shall ever be valid in this
State."
The trial court sustained Dick's contention and entered
judgment against the garnishees. On appeal, both in the
Court of Civil Appeals (8 S. W. (2d) 354) and in the
Supreme Court of the State (15 S.W. (2d) 1028), the
garnishees asserted that, as construed and applied, the
Texas statute violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the contract clause. Both courts
treated the policy provision as equivalent to a foreign
statute of limitation; held that Article 5545 related to
the remedy available in Texas courts; concluded that it
was validly applicable to the case at bar; and affirmed the
judgment of the trial court. The garnishees appealed
to this Court on the ground that the statute, as construed
and applied, violated their rights under the Federal Constitution. Dick moved to dismiss the appeal for want of
jurisdiction. Then the garnishees filed, also, a petition
for a writ of certiorari. Consideration of the jurisdiction
of this Court on the appeal, and of the petition for certiorari, was postponed to the hearing of the case on the
merits.
First. Dick contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction
-of the action, because the errors assigned involve only
questions of local law and of conflict of laws. The argument is that while a provision requiring notice of loss
within a fixed period, is substantive because it is a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action,
the provision for liability only in case suit is brought
within the year is not substantive because it relates only
to the remedy after accrual of the cause of action; that
while the validity, interpretation and performance of the
substantive provisions of a contract are determined by

406

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

the law of the place where it is made and is to be performed, matters which relate only to the remedy are
unquestionably governed by the lex fori; and that even
if the Texas court erred in holding the statute applicable
to this contract, the error is one of state law or of the
interpretation of the contract, and is not reviewable here.
The contention is unsound. There is no dispute as to
the meaning of the provision in the policy. It is that
the insurer shall not be liable unless suit is brought '
within one year of the loss. Whether the provision be
interpreted as making the commencement of a suit within
the year a condition precedent to the existence of a cause
of action, or as making failure to sue, within the year a
breach of a condition subsequent which extinguishes the
cause of action, is not of legal significance here.' Nor are
we concerned with the question whether the provision is
properly described as relating to remedy or to substance.
However characterized, it is an express term in the contract of the parties by which the right of the insured and
the correlative obligation of the insurer are defined. If
effect is given to the clause, Dick cannot recover from the
Mexican corporation and the garnishees cannot be compelled to pay. If, on the other hand, the statute is applied
to the contract, it admittedly abrogates a contractual right
' That a provision requiring notice of loss withn a fixed period and
one requiring the bringing of suit, stand upon the same footing was
held in Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Co., 7 Wall. 386, 390.
Compare Semfies v. Hartford Insurance Co., 13 Wall. 158, 161. The
validity and effectiveness of a clause limiting the time for suit, in the
absence of a controlling statute, was recognized also in Texas, Suggs v.

Travelers Insurance Co., 71 Texas 579. In that case, decided before
the enactment of Article 5545, the Texas court upheld a similar provision in an insurance policy against the claim of an infant without
capacity to sue. The court described the nature of the provision
thus (p. 581): "It is said to differ from the statutory limitation in
this, that it does not merely deny the remedy, but forfeits the liability
when the suit is not brought within the stipulated time."

HOME INS. CO. v. DICK.
397

Opinion of the Court.

and imposes liability, although the parties have agreed
that there should be none.
The statute is not simply one of limitation. It does not
merely fix the time in which the aid of the Texas courts
may be invoked. Nor does it govern only the remedies
available in the Texas courts. It deals with the powers
and capacities of persons and corporations. It expressly
prohibits the making of certain contracts. As construed,
it also directs the disregard in Texas of contractual rights
and obligations wherever created and assumed; and it
commands the enforcement of obligations in excess of
those contracted for. Therefore, the objection that, as
applied to contracts made and to be performed outside
of Texas, the statute violates the Federal Constitution,
raises federal questions of substance; and the existence of
the federal claim is not disproved by saying that the statute, or the one year provision in the policy, relates to
the remedy and not to the substance.
That the federal questions were not raised in the trial
court is immaterial. For, the Court of Civil Appeals and
the Supreme Court of the State considered the questions
as properly raised in the appellate proceedings and passed
on them adversely to the federal claim. Chicago, Rock
Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Perry, 259 U. S. 548, 551;
Sully v. American National Bank, 178 U. S. 289, 298.
The case is properly here on appeal. The motion to dismiss the appeal is overruled; and the petition for certiorari is, therefore, denied.
Second. The Texas statute as here construed and applied deprives the garnishees of property without due
process of law. A State may, of course, prohibit and declare invalid the making of certain contracts within its
borders. Ordinarily, it may prohibit performance within
its borders, even of contracts validly made elsewhere, if
they are required to be pdrformed within the State. and
their performance would violate its laws. But, in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

case at bar, nothing in any way relating to the policy
sued on, or to the contracts of reinsurance, was ever done
or required to be done in Texas. All acts relating to the
making of the policy were done in Mexico. All in relation to the making of the contracts of re-insurance were
done there or in New York. And, likewise, all things in
regard to performance were to be done outside of Texas.
Neither the Texas laws nor the Texas courts were invoked
for any purpose, except by Dick in the bringing of this
suit. The fact that Dick's permanent residence was in
Texas is without significance. At all times here material,
he was physically present and acting in Mexico. Texas
was, therefore, without power to affect the terms of contracts so made. Its attempt to impose a greater obligation than that agreed upon and to seize property in payment of the imposed obligation violates the guaranty
against deprivation of property without due process of
law. Compahia General de Tabacos v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 275 U. S. 87; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.
Dunken, 266 U. S. 389; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge,
246 U. S. 357. Compare Modern Woodmen of America
v. Mixer, 267 U. S. 544, 551P
The cases relied upon, in which it was held that a State
may lengthen its statute of limitations, are not in point.
5The division of this Court in the Tabacos and Dodge cases was
not on the lrinciple here stated, but on the question of fact whether
there were in those cases things done within the State of which the
State could properly lay hold as the basis of the regulations there
imposed. Compare Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co.,. 275 U. S. 274;
Palmetto FireIns. Co. v. Conn, 272 U. S. 295. In the absence of any
such things, as in this case, the Court was agreed that a State is without power to impose either public or private obligations on contracts
made outside of the State and not to be performed there. Compare
Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Liebing, 259 U. S. 209; E. Merrick

Dodd, Jr., "The Power of the Supreme Court to Review State Decisions in the Field of Conflict of Laws," 39 Harv. L. Rev. (1926)

Opinion of the Court.

See Atchafalaya Land Co. v. Williams Cypress Co., 258
U. S. 190; National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating
Co., 226 U. S. 276; Vance v. Vance, 108 U. S. 514. In
those cases, the parties had not stipulated a time limit
for the enforcement of their obligations. It is true that
a State may extend the time within which suit may be
brought in its own courts, if, in doing so, it violates no
agreement of the parties.6 And, in the absence of a contractual provision, the local statute of limitation may be
applied to a right created in another jurisdiction even
where the remedy in the latter is barred.7 In such cases,
the rights and obligations of the parties are not varied.
When, however, the parties have expressly agreed upon a
time limit on their obligation, a statute which invalidates
the agreement and directs enforcement of the contract
after the time has expired increases their .obligation and
imposes a burden not contracted for.
It is true also that a State is not bound to provide
iemedies and procedure to suit the wishes of individual
litigants. It may prescribe the kind of remedies to be
available in its courts and dictate the practice and procedure to be followed in pursuing those remedies. Con-

e The State courts placed some reliance on Campbell v. Holt, 115
U. S. 620. Whether, as there held, a statute of limitations may also
be lengthened so as to affect liabilities already barred is not here
pertinent. There is a clear difference between the revival of a
liability which is unenforcible only because a statute has barred the
remedy regardless of the will of the parties, and the extension of a
liability beyond the limit expressly agreed upon by the parties.
Compare National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating Co., 226
U. S. 276, 282; William Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. R. Co.,
268 U. S. 633, 636.
7Whether a distinction is to be drawn between statutes of limitation which extinguish or limit the right and those which merely bar
the remedy, we need not now determine. Compare Davis v. Mills,
194 U. S. 451 and Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, 233 U. S.
157 with Canadian Pac. Ry. Co. v. Johnston, 61 Fed. 738.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U.S.

tractual provisions relating to these matters, even if valid
where made, are often disregarded by the court of the
forum, pursuant to statute or otherwise. But the Texas
statute deals neither with the kind of remedy available
nor with the mode in which it is to be pursued. It purports to create rights and obligations. It may not validly
affect contracts which are neither made nor' are to be
performed in Texas.
Third. Dick urges that Article 5545 of the Texas law is
a declaration of its public policy; and that a State may
properly refuse to recognize foreign rights which violate
its declared policy. Doubtless, a State may prohibit the
enjoyment by persons within its borders of rights acquired
elsewhere which violate its laws or public policy; and,
under some circumstances, it may refuse to aid in the enforcement of such rights. Bothwell v. Buckbee, Meatrs
Co., 275 U. S.274, 277-9; Union Trust Co. v. Grosmon,
245 U. S. 412; compare Fauntleroyv. Lum, 210 U. S.230.
But the Mexican corporation never was in Texas; and
neither it nor the garnishees invoked the aid of the Texas
courts or the Texas laws. The Mexican corporation was
not before the court. The garnishees were brought in by
compulsory process. Neither has asked favors. They
ask only to be let alone. We need not consider how
far the State may go in imposing restrictions on the conduct of its own residents, and of foreign corporations
which have received permission to do business within its
borders; or how far it may go in refusing to lend the aid
of its courts to the enforcement of rights acquired outside
its borders. It may not abrogate the rights of parties.
beyond its borders having no relation to anything done
or to be done within them.
Fourth. Finally, it is urged that the Federal Constitution does not require the States to recognize and protect
rights derived from the laws of foreign countries-that
as to them the full faith and credit clause has no applica,-

tion. See Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Tremblay, 223 U. S. 185.
The claims here asserted are not based upon the full faith
and credit clause. Compare Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237
U. S. 531; Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, 267
U. S. 544. They rest upon the Fourteenth Amendment.
Its protection extends to aliens. Moreover, the parties
in interest here are American companies. The defense
asserted is based on the provision of the policy and on
their contracts of reinsurance. The courts of the State
confused this defense with that based on the Mexican
Code. They held that even if the effect of the foreign
statute was to extinguish the right, Dick's removal to
Texas prior to the bar of the foreign statute, removed the
cause of action from Mexico and subjected it to the Texas
statute of limitation. And they applied the same rule to
the provision in the policy. Whether or not that is a sufficient answer to the defense based on the foreign law, we
may not consider; for, no issue under the full faith and
credit clause was raised. But in Texas, as elsewhere, the
contract was subject to its own limitations.
Fifth. The garnishees contend that the guaranty of
the contract clause relates not to the date of enactment
of a statute, but to the date of its effect on contracts; that,
when issued, the policy of the Mexican corporation was
concededly not subject to Texas law.; that, although the
statute relied upon by Dick was passed prior to the making of the contract, it did not operate upon *the contract
until this suit was. brought in the Texas court; and that,
hence, the statute violates the contract clause. Since we
hold that the Texas statute, as construed and applied, violates the due process clause, we have no 'oecasion to consider this contention. Nor have we considered their further contention, in reliance upon Morris & Co. v. Skandinavia Ins. Co., 279 U. S. 405, that there was lack of jurisdiction over them for purposes of garnishment, because
the authorization of service upon their local agents is lim-

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF, NORTH DAKOTA.

No. 364. Argued April 17, 1930.-Decided May 19, 1930.
1. Save as may be validly provided by Act of Congress, railroad
rates established by a State for its internal commerce can not
be interfered with by the federal courts upon the ground that
they work undue and unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce. Pp. 420 et seq.
2. Whether intrastate railroad rates ordered by state authority
should be set aside as working undue and unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce is a question which, by the Interstate Commerce Act, is confided for determination in the first
instance to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Id.
3. Where the sole objection to a state order reducing intrastate rates
is alleged undue discrimination against interstate commerce, a
federal court has no authority to enjoin their enforcement-not
even temporarily, to await the Commission's determination of that
question in a pending proceeding. P. 430.
33 F. (2d) 934, reversed.

from a decree of interlocutory injunction granted
by the District Court of three judges, in a suit brought
by a number of railroads attacking an order of the Railroad Commissioners fixing intrastate class rates in North
Dakota.
