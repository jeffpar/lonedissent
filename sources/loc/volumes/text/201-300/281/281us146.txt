had liquor in his possession on a railroad train running
on a right of way through the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana was not guilty of the offense of introducing liquor into the " Indian country." By agreement
between the Indians and the United States, the Indians
had surrendered all their "right, title and interest," the
land had been freed from the Indian right of occupancy,
and the Indian title had thus been entirely extinguished.
The land could not be considered " Indian. country."
We conclude that the District Court erred in sustaining
the plea.
Judgment reversed.
OHIO OIL COMPANY v. CONWAY, SUPERVISOR
OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS OF LOUISIANA.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOIH THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 440.

Argued March 4, 1930.-Decided April 14, 1930.

1. A Louisiana severance tax on crude petroleum at specific rates per
barrel, the rates varying in accordance with a classification of the
oils based on the Baumn Scale of Gravity, held consistent with Art.
X, ยง 21 of the Louisiana Constitution, which provides that such natural resources "may be classified for the purpose of taxation and
such taxes predicated upon either the quantity or the value of the
product at the time and place where it was severed." P. 158.
2. The Fourteenth Amendment imposes no iron rule of equality prohibiting the flexibility and variety appropriate to schemes of state
taxation. P. 159.
3. A State may impose different specific taxes on different products
and in so doing is not required to make close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity wilh reference to composition,
use, or value. It may classify broadly the subjects of taxation if it
does so on a rational basis, avoiding classification that is palpably
arbitrary. P. 159.
4. In laying a graduated specific severance tax per barrel on oils
sold primarily for their gasoline content, resort to Baum6 gravity

Argument for Appellant.

as the basis of classification cannot be regarded as palpably arbitrary, it appearing that gravity, though not invariably accurate as
a test, is generally regarded in the industry as indicative of gasoline
content and is used by the industry, including the complaining taxpayer, in fixing the prices of such oils. P. 160.
5. A graduation of the tax on this basis, which treats all oils of the
same gravity alike, is not repugnant to the equal protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the tax falls more
heavily upon some oils than upon others of equal gravity due to
the fact that there are various gravity schedules of prices and that
some oils are sold at flat prices. P. 160..
6. The statute in question, by graduating the tax per barrel in accordance with a classification of oils based on their Baum6 gravity,
had the effect of including in the division of lowest tax a class of
oils valuable chiefly as a source of lubricating oil rather than of
gasoline, which .are tested in the industry by their viscosity and
sulphur content, not by their Baum6 gravity, and are not sold on
the latter basis. It resulted that the tax on these oils was lower in
proportion to value than that imposed on other oils not so well
suited -for making lubricating oil. Held that the discrimination was
not repugnant to the equal protection clause, since the oils especially
suitable for making lubricating oil might lawfully have been classified apart for taxation, or not taxed at all, because of their distinct compositioi and utility (Heisler v. Colliery Co., 260 U. S.
245), and the statute was not made invalid by the failure to describe them scientifically. P. 161.
7. The State is not prevented by the Federal Constitution from putting the same specific severance tax on the same sort of oils used
in the same way, merely because particular producers of such oils
obtain different prices for them. P. 162.
34 F. (2d) 47, affirmed.

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court of three
judges, which dismissed the Oil Company's bill seeking to
enjoin the enforcement of a Louisiana tax. The case was
here before on appeal from an order denying an interlocutory injunction, 279 U. S. 813.
Mr. Sidney L. Herold, with whom Messrs. Sumter
Cousin and R. L. Benoit were on the brief, for appellant.

148

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Argument for Appellant.

281 U. S.

Gravity in no respect enters as a common measurement into the ascertainment of the relative values of oils
produced within Louisiana; and the selection of gravity
as the basis of such admeasurements ineluctably leads to
a systematic discrimination against the producers in the
fields in which this complainant operates.
If gravity is not a common measure of value as between
oils of different composition, there could be no more justification for its use in the measurement of the tax on all
oils generally than there could be for the use of either the
passenger-mile base or the ton-mile base for determining
a common rate for both freight and passenger tariffs. Nor
is it enough for the State to point out merely that the
oils are of different weights. It is necessary that there be
in that fact some reason for using it as a basis of classification. Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32.
Nothing can serve as a basis of classification that is not
relevant either to value, to utility, to profit or to some
end or purpose of sound public policy, where the direct
result of its use is the imposition of materially variant tax
burdens on persons similarly situated. Taxes may be
levied on natural resources severed from the soil or water,
to. be paid proportionately by the owners thereof at the
time of severance. The Louisiana Constitution and the
statute both speak of the tax as one upon the product.
The case is entirely different from Choctaw, 0. & G.
Ry. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 290, and Oliver Iron Mining
Co. v. Lord, 262 U. S. 172, where the tax was of a percentage on the gross receipts, or of the gross value of
the product. Likewise, it differs from Gulf Refining Co.
v. McFarland,154 La. 251, 264 U. S. 573.
If this were in form a general property tax, and the
assessing authorities had proceeded to value the properties of the various producers in the State, not according
to their value, but according to the gravity of the oil
produced, the same concrete result would have been

OHIO OIL CO. v. CONWAY.
146

Argument for Appellant.

reached as in this case; and it is settled law that in such a
case relief would be granted because of the violation of
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
occasioned by such act. Raymond v. Chicago Traction
Co., 207 U. S. 20; Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield
Township, 247 U. S. 350; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, 260 U. S. 441; N. C, & St. P. R. Co. v. Taylor, 86 Fed. 168; Louisville Trust Co. v. Stone, 107 Fed.
305; Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32;
Martin v. District of Columbia, 205 U. S. 135; Bell's Gap
R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232.
Whether the denial of equal protection results from the
use of the gravity scale or from the arbitrary system of
classification thereunder, is immaterial.
Oils produced in the same district, and even from the
same lease, would fall by the operation of the statute
into separate classes paying entirely different and discriminatory rates of taxation. The record contains nothing from which the conclusion could be reached that an
oil of 32 gravity produced in a particular field should pay
a tax of 5 cents per barrel, while oil of 32.1 gravity in the
same field should pay a tax of 8 cents per barrel; and yet
such is the effect of the statute. The arrangement of the
progression of the tax is such that the increase necessarily
and systematically is unrelated to increase in value.
The act works a systematic and hostile discrimination
against appellant in favor of others similarly'situated, for
at all times higher gravity oils of lower value are burdened
with a materially higher tax than oils of lower gravity
and greater value. The act "has no tendency to produce
equality." Cf. Air Way ElectricalAppliance Corp.v. Day,
266 U.,S. 71; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 369; Sunday

Louisiana. The tax is levied neither according to quantity nor to value.
The only measure of quantity is the barrel of 42 gallons.
And yet the statute directly provides that such quantity
shall be taxed, not at a fixed rate, but according to a
scale under which the highest tax is almost three times
that of the lowest one.

MR. CHIEF JUsTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The Ohio Oil Company brought this suit in the District
Court to enjoin the enforcement of a statute of Louisiana
(Act 5 of 1928) imposing a severance tax upon the production of oil. The statute as applied to the complainant
was attacked as a violation both of the constitution of
Louisiana and of the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Fqderal Constitution. It
was alleged that the laws of the State afforded no remedy
for the recovery of taxes illegally exacted. On appeal
from an order denying an interlocutory injunction, this
Court decided that the questions presented could not be
resolved satisfactorily upon the affidavits submitted, and
directed that an injunction should be granted pendente
lite on stated terms. 279 U. S. 813. Trial was had before
the District Court, as specially constituted under the
applicable statute, and a decree was entered dismissing
the bill. 34 Fed. (2d) 47. The complainant appeals.
In the year 1921, the constitution of Louisiana was
amended so as to provide that natural resources severed
from the soil or water might be classified for the purpose
of taxation and that taxes might be "predicated upon

OHIO OIL CO. v. CONWAY.
146

151

Opinion of the Court.

either the quantity or value of the product at the time
and place where it is severed" (Const. Art. X, Sec. 21).'
By Act 140 of 1922, section 2, natural resources were
divided into two classes, and taxes were levied on oil and
gas at three per cent. of the gross market value of the
total production, and on all other natural resources at
two per cent. of the gross market value. The Supreme
Court of Louisiana, sustaining this tax on oil and natural
gas, held that it was not a property tax but was an excise
tax upon the privilege of severing, although it was measured by the value of the property severed. This decision
was affirmed here. Gulf Refining Company v. McFarland, 154 La. Ann. 251; 264 U. S.573.
In 1928, the legislature of Louisiana enacted the statute
now in question which amended the prior act so as to tax
various natural resources on the basis of the quantity
severed. Under this amendment taxes on oil were classified according to gravity and ran from four cents a barrel
of 42 gallons on oil of 28 degrees gravity and below, to
eleven cents a barrel on oil above 43 degrees gravity (Act
5 of 1928).2
1 Section 21 is as follows: "Taxes may be levied on natural resources
severed from the soil or water, to be paid proportionately by the
owners thereof at the time of severance. Such natural resources
may be classified for the purpose of taxation and such taxes predicated upon either the quantity or value of the. product at the time
and place where it is severed. No severance tax shall bd levied
by any parish or other local subdivision of the State.
"No'further or additional tax or license shall be levied or imposed
upon oil or gas leases or rights, nor shall any additional value be added
to the assessment of land, by reason of the presence of oil or gas
therein or their production therefrom."
2 The text of section 2 of Act 5 of 1928 in relation to oil is as
follows: "Taxes on natural resources severed from the soil or
water . . .shall be predicated on the quantity severed, and shall be
paid at the following rates:

152

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

The business of the complainant in Louisiana is that
of producing and selling oil and not of refining it. The
production of the complainant is in the following fields:
Haynesville, in the parish of Claiborne; Cotton Valley,
in the parish of Webster; Pine Island, in the parish of
Caddo; Urania, in the parish of La Salle. All these
fields are in North Louisiana. The bulk of the complainant's production is in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley and
Pine Island fields. Its production in these fields from
January to June, 1928, inclusive, amounted to 723,192
barrels out of its total production in Louisiana of 762,139
barrels; and from August, 1928, to March, 1929, inclusive,
to 690,397 barrels out of its total production of 705,301
barrels; the remainder was Urania production.
Gravity as used in the statute, and in oil price quotations, is not specific gravity, but what is called Baum6
gravity, under which the lighter the oil the higher the
gravity. The record shows that, generally speaking,
crude petroleums are divided into three classes--paraffine
base, asphalt base, and mixed base, the last being a combination of paraffine and asphalt base. The higher gravity oils usually have a paraffine base, while the lower
.gravity oils usually have an asphalt base. All three of
these classes are found in Louisiana. In North Louisiana
"(7) a. On oil of 28 gravity and below, four (4) cents per barrel
of 42 gallons.
"b. (1) On oil above 28 gravity and not above 31 gravity, four
and one-fourth (4 ) cents per barrel of 42 gallons.
"b. (2) On oil above 31 gravity and not above 32 gravity, five
(5) cents per barrel of 42 gallons.
"(c) On oil above 32 gravity and not above 36 gravity, eight (8)
cents per barrel of 42 gallons.
"(d) On oil above 36 gravity and not above 43 gravity, ten (10)
cents per barrel of 42 gallons.
"(e) On oil above 43 gravity, eleven (11) cents per barrel of 42
gallons."

OHIO OIL CO. v. CONWAY.
146

Opinion of the Court.

there are paraffine base, asphalt base and mixed base
crudes, the oils generally having paraffine base, while in
South Louisiana the oil produced is mostly asphalt base.
The process of refining oil is distillation. The evidehce
is that paraffine base oil in that manner yields gasoline,
kerosene, gas oil, some.lubricating oil and wax. Gasoline
comes off first and is the most valuable component of
such oil. Asphalt base oil usually yields a very small
amount of gasoline by distillation, the first product ordinarily being gas oil, then lubricating oil, and the residuum, asphalt. The gas oil may be subjected to the
cracking process and gasoline may be obtained in that
way. The value of asphalt base oil is largely for the
manufacture of lubricating oil, and the value for this
purpose is determined by viscosity and sulphur content,
not by gravity. The coastal oils of South Louisiana are
divided into "A" and "B" grades, " Grade A" being the
oils that are useful in the production of lubricating oil,
and the other oils being classed as " Grade B." While
gravity is not the determining factor, it appears from the
testimony that "Grade A" oils must be less than 25
degrees gravity.
Asphalt base oils are produced in North Louisiana in
the fields'of Pine Island, Urania, Hosston and Bellevue.
The last three named are suitable for making lubricating
oil, but the Pine Island heavy oil does not have that value.
The evidence is that the Urania, Hosston and Bellevue
oils, used for that purpose, are practically the same as
the coastal "Grade A" oils.
Gravity is said to be an index of relative value of oils
only in the same pool or district, and oils of different
gravity are produced in the same fields and from the same
tracts of land and sometimes from the same sand. But
it appears that, with respect to paraffine base oils, the
higher the gravity, the greater is the gasoline content,

154

281 U. S.

which as between these oils is largely determinative of
price. Gravity in such cases is a rough and familiar
method of approximating the gasoline content, and in
many fields price quotations of crude oil above 28 degrees
are graduated according to gravity.
Crude oil as it comes from the wells is run into tanks
from which the purchaser sells to pipe lines, the wellrecognized market prices being the prices posted by the
pipe line companies buying the oil. The complainant
states that the oil produced in its Haynesville field was
from 33 to 36 degrees gravity; in its Cotton Valley field,
one class was between 28 and 31 degrees gravity and
another above 43 degrees gravity; in its Pine Island field,
its production was from 37 to 41 degrees gravity. The
complainant purchased no crude oil except that, in the
Haynesville field, it bought some of the royalty oil of
the lessors under its leases. The complainant's cashier
testified at the trial that complainant's "purchases and
sales in each field in which it operates are made on a
gravity basis."
This testimony is not understood to include the Urania
field in which the complainant was not operating at the
time but had been operating until shortly before. The
oil frpm the Urania field, which was about 20 degrees
gravity, as well as that of the Bellevue and Hosston fields
in North -,Louisiana, and the "Grade A" coastal oils of
South Louisiana, were sold at a flat price and not by
gravity. "Grade B" oil, it was testified, was usually
sold on a gravity schedule.
In 1928, the production of oil in Louisiana was about
22,000,000 barrels, of which approximately two-thirds was
produced in North Louisiana, and of this amount nearly
two-thirds was sold on a gravity basis, and the remainder
at a flat price. Of the production in South Louisiana,
about one-half was sold on a gravity basis.

tral Texas, Gulf Coast, and other sections, are shown
in the trade journals and were put in evidence. The
quotations that are according to gravity have a rising
scale of prices as gravity increases.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

greater than those from South Louisiana; this fact, the
respondent insists, accounts for the difference in the price
of the oils at the wells.
The complainant's contention under the constitution
of Louisiana is that the tax is invalid because it was not
levied according to either quantity or value. It manifestly is a specific tax at a rate per barrel of 42 gallons,
and not strictly ad valorem. The graduation of the tax
according to the gravity of the oil does not make it other
than a tax according to quantity, that is, per barrel, as
the oils of different classes are treated for the purpose of
the tax as being in effect different commodities, each of
which ha. its separate tax. We have not been referred to
any decision of the state court upon the point and, until
that court pronounces otherwise, we see no reason to
hold that the tax is unauthorized by the State.
The further argument is made that the classification of
oils is unreasonable and hence is not permitted by the
state constitution. This is substantially the same question, from the standpoint of state authority, that is presented as a Federal ground of attack under the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The complainant contends that the statute of Louisiana, imposing a tax according to gravity, operates as an
arbitrary discrimination; that it discriminates in a wholly
unjustifiable manner between the oils of'the North Louisiana and South Louisiana fields, and also between the
fields producing asphalt base oils. The tax on its production in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley and Pine Island
fields is said to be at a rate from about six to seven and
one-half per cent. of its value; and on the production in
the Urania field, at about five and one-third per cent. of
the value; while on the production in fields in South
Louisiana, and in the Bellevue field, in North Louisiana,
the tax is between three and three and one-half per cent.
of the-value.

OHIO OIL CO. v. CONWAY.

Opinion of the Court.

The applicable principles are familiar.
The States
have a wide discretion in the imposition of taxes. When
dealing with their proper domestic concerns, and not
trenching upon the prerogatives of the national government or violating the guarantees of the Federal Constitution, the States have the attribute of sovereign powers
in devising their fiscal systems to insure revenue and
foster their local interests. The States, in the exercise
of their taxing power, as Wvith respect to the eertion of
other powers, are subject to the requirements 6f the due
process and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment, but that Amendment imposes no iron rule
of equality, prohibiting the flexibility and variety that are
appropriate to schemes of taxation. The State may tax
real and personal property in a different manner. It
may grant exemptions. The State is not limited to ad
valorerm taxation. It may impose different specific taxes
upon different trades and professions and may vary the
rates of excise upon various products. In levying such
taxes, the State is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with
reference to composition, use or value.. To hold otherwise, would be to subject the essetial taxing power of
the State to an intolerable supervision, hostile to the basic
principles of our Government and wholly beyond the
protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment was intended to assure. Bell's Gap Railroad

Opinion of the Court.

281 U. S.

With all this freedom of action, there is a point beyond
which the State can not go without violating the equal
protection clause. The State may classify broadly the
subjects of taxation, but in doing so it must proceed upon
a rational basis. The State is not at liberty to resort to
a classification that is palpably arbitrary. The rule is
generally stated to be that the classification "must rest
upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all
persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike."
Royster Guano Company v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415;
Louisville Gas Company v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37;
Air-Way Corporationv. Day, 266 U. S. 71, 85; Schlesinger
v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230, 240.
In the present instance it is apparent that a classification according to gravity cannot be regarded as palpably
arbitrary. While the Baum6 gravity of oils may vary,
even in the same fields, it has been used by the oil industry as indicating in a general way, apparently satisfactory
for practical purposes, the gasoline content. In laying a
specific severance tax per barrel, the State was not compelled to make an exact determination of the composition
of each oil produced. At least with respect to oils sold
primarily for the gasoline they contained, it cannot be
said that the State attempted a hostile and unjustifiable
discrimination in graduating its tax according to gravity,
when the industry itself resorted to the factor of gravity
in fixing the scale of prices for such oils. Further, the
complainant is in no position to contest the action of
the State in adopting a gravity basis with respect to the
production of its oils in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley
and Pine Island fields, which constituted over ninety per
cent. of its entire production, as the complainant itself
sold these oils on a gravity basis. If it be granted, as we
think it must be, that the state could adjust the severance
tax with resnect to such oils according to gravity, the

question comes simply to that of the particular graduation of the tax. There are, it is true, various gravity
schedules of prices, and the same fields may produce oils
of different gravities, and oils broadly of the same sort
may be sold at flat prices, but, if the State was at liberty
to adopt a gravity scale for oils which in such large measure were sold on this basis, the State was not required to
grade its tax with a nicety which would. assign to every
oil produced a grade absolutely corresponding to its actual
value. That would mean that the State could tax only
on a strictly ad valorem basis, a contention wholly inadmissible. In grading atax, admittedly within its power to
levy, the State had a large discretion and there appears
to be no ground for holding that there was such an abuse
in this instance as to create constitutional invalidity.
Clark v. Titusville, 184 U. S. 329, 331. The graduation
of the tax on these oils corresponded generally to the
supposed increase of gasoline content, and all oils of the
same gravity were treated alike.
The question raised by the complainant has particular
bearing upon the discrimination with respect to oils under
28 degrees gravity. The complainant in this respect must
stand on its own case. Its oil of this sort is its Urania
production, and that oil, as well as that of the Bellevue
field in North Louisiana, is said to be "practically the
same" as the coastal "Grade A" oils of South Louisiana.
According to complainant's own showing, these oils are
especially suited to the manufacture of lubricating oil and
are dealt in with that in view. While in such cases,
gravity is not the criterion, but rather viscosity and
sulphur content, these are oils of relatively low gravity,that is, under 28 degrees, and the Louisiana severance tax
is a uniform one of four cents a barrel. As these last
mentioned oils had a distinct composition and a different
utility, the State could impose a tax upon them which
was different from that imposed upon the other oils pro98234 -30-11

duced by the complainant and not so well suited for the
making of lubricating oil. The State might have concluded not to tax the former at all, and in that case there
would have been no constitutional ground of complaint
because a tax was laid on the different oils of the Haynesville Cotton Valley and Pine Island fields. In Heisler
v. Thomas Colliery Company, supra, complaint was made
of a statute of Pennsylvania because it levied a tax on
anthracite coal and not on bituminous coal. The contention was founded on the fact that both were fuels and
that anthracite coal in steam sizes competed with bituminous coal and certain sub-grades of the latter competed
with certain sub-grades of anthracite. The Court, accepting the fact of competition, nevertheless sustained
'the tax, holding that the differences between the two sorts
of coal justified the .classification. If the State had described the oils especially suitable for the manufacture
of lubricating oil with respect to their composition or
use, and had taxed them at four cents a barrel, it could
not be said that the statute was beyond the power of the
State to enact simply because it subjected the complainant to a different tax on its oils of a different character.
The statute is not made invalid by reason of a failure to
describe the oils scientifically.
The question is thus reduced to the discrimination
alleged with respect to the tax on the complainant's
Urania production as compared with similar oils. As all
these oils bear the same tax of four cents a barrel, the
complainant manifestly has no ground for complaint on
this score unless it can be found in differences in the prices
of these oils. Urania oil was sojd at seventy-five cents a
barrel, while "Grade A" oil brought $1.20 a barrel. The
record affords no explanation of the reason for this wide
spread in the price of oils, said to be practically the same
and used for the same purpose, unless it be the one advanced by the respondent that the difference is due to the

distance of the fields from the common market and the
consequent difference in transportation charges. Whether
or not this is an adequate explanation, it can not be said
that the State, from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution, could'not put the same specific severance tax on
the same sort of oils'used in the same way, merely because
particular producers of such oils might obtain different
prices. There may be many reasons why one owner obtains more in gross return for the' same sort of commodities than another owner, and still other reasons why
the net returns of the one may be more than those of the
other. This Court recently decided that a tax imposed
by Alabama on those selling cigars and cigarettes, which
was based on the "wholesale sales price" was not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment because of an alleged
difference in the wholesale prices paid by dealers who
bought from the manufacturers and by those who did not.
