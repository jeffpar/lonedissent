LOUISVILLE GAS & ELECTRIC COMPANY v.
COLEMAN, AUDITOR.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 70.

Argued October 26, 1927. Reargued February 29, 1928.Decided April 30, 1928.

1. A statute of Kentucky, where the recording of mortgages is essential to the protection of mortgagees against bona fide purchasers
and creditors, conditions the recording of mortgages not maturing
within five years upon the payment of a tax of 200 for each $100
of value secured; but mortgages maturing within that period it
exempts entirely. Held that the tax is void under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 35-38.
2. The equal protection clause means that the rights of all persons
must rest upon the same rule under similar circumstances. It
applies to the exercise of all the powers of the State which can
affect the individual or his property, including the power of taxation. P. 37.
3. Classification must always rest upon some difference which bears
a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect of which the
classification is proposed. Id.
4. Discriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful
consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to this
constitutional provision. Id.
5. In the application of the equal protection clause to the tax here
in question, it is immaterial whether it be called a privilege tax or
a property tax. P. 38.
6. The time within which the indebtedness secured by a mortgage is
to be paid may be a proper element in fixing the amount of a tax
for recording it, but this classification cannot be used to justify
taxing some, while others, under circumstances identical in all
respects save taxable value, are entirely exempt. Id.
7. Owing to the character and quasi-public purposes of building and
loan associations in Kentucky, the provision of the statute in question exempting them from payment of the recording tax, is not
violative of the equal protection clause. P. 40.

Humphrey was on the biief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Clifford E. Smith, with whom Messrs. Frank E.
Daugherty,Attorney General of Kentucky, and CharlesF.
Creal, Assistant Attorney General, were on the brief, for
defendant in error.
The Fourteenth Amendment has never been so applied
by this Court as to interfere with the States in adopting
a system of taxation, or in making classifications of
properties or: objects for taxation. It is not a shield
against every inequality or injustice, that may result from
unwise state legislation. It imposes no "iron rule of
taxation" upon the States, but is only applied when
there is such a clear discrimination as to amount to a
deniaf of equal protection of the law or a deprivation of
property without due process of law within the meaning
of its provisions.
The opinion of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in
Middendorf v. Goodale, 202 Ky. 118, holding that the
exemptions granted do not render the statute repugnant
to the federal or state constitutions, is well fortified by
authorities cited, especially as to the exemption of building and loan associations. None of the authorities cited
bears directly on the application of the statute to mortgages where the indebtedness matures within five years.
However, many of them sustain in principle the distinction or discrimination made as to such mortgages.
The reason for the distinction is as 'obvious as to one
class as to the other. It will ipot be sriously contended

that an exemption might not have been granted as to
mortgages securing indebtedness up to a certain fixed
amount. It would not be difficult to find reasons for
the exemption of mortgages as to so much of the indebtedness as does not mature within five years.
It is a matter of common knowledge that short term
loans carry the highest legal rate of interest and often,
directly or indirectly, usurious rates, Whereas long term
loans are secured at lesser rates, usually one-half to two
per cent. less than the maximum legal rate. In view of
this favorable interest rate, the tax on the long term loan
is not a great burden or hardship, the tax amounting to
only one-fifth of one per cent. for one year. And again, a
mortgagor in securing a long term loan, secures his mortgaged assets to the extent of such loan and for the term
thereof against all subsequent creditors and all debts or
claims arising under contract or otherwise. We might
add other reasons for the distinction, but the basis for it
is too apparent to require elaboration.
Congress and federal courts recognize such a distinction between building and loan associations and other corporations as to warrant a discrimination in favor of the
former in matters of taxation. See Corporation Excise
Tax Act, Income Tax Act, War Revenue Act, Central
Building Co. v. Bowland, 216 Fed. 526.
The rule of uniformity and equality prescribed by the
Fourteenth Amendment only requires that the statute
shall apply alike to all of a class under the same circumstances and conditions. The statute under consideration
meets this rule. The courts have upheld statutes where
the reason for classification or discrimination was no more
apparent than they are here. Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, 142 U. S. 339; Citizens Telephone Co- v. Fuller, 229

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The plaintiff in error, a Kentucky corporation, exe-cuted a deed of trust of property in that State to secure
bonds amounting in the aggregate to $150,000,000, of
which $18,805;900 were issued, bearing date November 1,
1922, and maturing November 1, 1952. The deed was
presented to the clerk of the- Jefferson county court for
record and payment made of the lawful recording fee
required by the state statute, but the clerk refused to
record the deed unless plaintiff in error paid to him a tax
of 200 on each $100 of the $18,805,000, as required by
ยง 4019a-9 of the Kentucky statutes, Carroll's Edition,
1922, the pertinent portions of which follow:
"A tax of twenty cents (20,0) is hereby imposed upon
each one hundred ($100.00) or fraction thereof of indebtedness which is, or may be, in any contingency secured
by any mortgage of property in this state, which mortgage shall be lodged for record after this act goes into
effect where the indebtedness does not mature within
five years.
t .
provided, however, the provisions of this
section shall not apply to mortgages executed to building
and loan associations."
It is provided by another Kentucky statute that no
deed or deed of trust or mortgage shall be valid against
a purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice
thereof or against creditors until such deed or mortgage
shall be lodged for record. Ky. Stats., ยง 496. In view
of this statute, plaintiff in eiror concluded that it was
absolutely necessary to place the deed of trust of record,

277 U. S.

and thereupon, unwillingly and under protest, paid the
amount demanded in addition to the lawful recording fee.
Subsequently, plaintiff in error brought this action in
the proper state court to recover the amount of the tax
so paid upon the ground that the quoted provisions of
ยง 4019a-9 were contrary to the Kentucky constitution
requiring uniformity of taxes upon all property of the
same class, and upon the further ground that these
provisions denied the equal protection of the law and
deprived plaintiff in error of its property without due
process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. A demurrer to the
petition was sustained by the court of first instance and
the petition dismissed. Upon appeal to the state court
of appeals, the judgment was affirmed, sub nor. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Shanks, Auditor, 213 Ky. 762,
upon the authority of Middendorf v. Goodale, 202 Ky. 118.
The state court of appeals, in disposing of the contention that the statute violated the state constitution, held
that the tax imposed was not a property tax but a privilege tax, that is, a tax imposed upon the privilege of
recording mortgages, etc., the payment of which, it was
said, was entirely optional with the owners or holders
thereof. This determination of the state court, in so far
as it affects the challenge under the state constitution,
we accept as conclusive, in accordance with the wellsettled rule. Merchants'Bank v. Pennsylvania, 167 U. S.
461, 462. But the state court further held that the statute was not in conflict with the 6qual protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and this presents a different question calling for our independent consideration
and decision.
The contention on behalf of plaintiff in error is that
the equal protection clause is contravened by the provisions exempting from the operation of the tax, first, indebtedness which does not mature within five years;

LOUISVILLE GAS CO. v. COLEMAN.

Opinion of the Court.

and, second, mortgages executed to building and loan
associations.
The equal protection clause, like the due process of law
clause, is not susceptible' of exact delimitation. No definite rule in respect of either, which automatically will
solve the question in specific instances, can be formulated. Certain general principles, however, have been
established in the light of which the cases as they arise
are to be considered. In the -first place, it may be said
generally that the equal protection clause means that the
rights of all persons must rest upon the same rule under
similar circumstances, Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115
'U. S. 321, 337; Magoun v.Illinois Trust & Savings Bank,
170 U. S. 283, 293, and that it applies to the exercise of all
the powers of the state which can affect the individual or
his property, including the power of taxation. County of
Santa Clarav. Sou.thern. Pac. R: Co., 18 Fed. 385,388-399;
The Railroad Tax Cases, 13 Fed.- 722,: 733. It does not,
however, forbid classification; and the power of the state
to classify for purposes of taxation is. of wide range and
flexibility, provided always, that the classification "must
be rqasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some
ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation
to the object of the legislation, :so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike." Royster
Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415; Air-way Corp.
v. Day, 266 U. S. 71, 85; Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270
U. S. 230, 240. That is to say, mere difference is not
enough: the attempted classification "must always rest
upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just
relation to the act in respect to which the classification
is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis." Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v.
Ellis, 165 U. S. 150, 155. Discriminations of an' unusual
character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional

provision. Compare Martin v. District of Columbia, 205
U. S. 135, 130; Bell's Gap R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134
U. S. 232, 237.
While, for the purpose of determining whether the
statute assailed violates the federal Constitution, we are
not bound by the characterization of the tax by the state
court, St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U. S. 346,
348, the matter is here of little importance. The application of the equal protection clause does not depend upon
what name is given to the tax. Whether the tax now in
question be called a privilege tax or a property tax, it
falls in effect upon one indebtedness and not upon another where the sum of each is the same; where both
are incurred by corporations or both by natural persons;
where the percentage of interest to be paid is the same;
where the mortgage security is identical in all respects;
where, in short, the only difference well may be that one
is payable in 60 months and the other in 59 months. No
doubt the state may take into consideration as an element
in fixing the amount of the tax the time within which
the indebtedness is to be paid; for, since the tax is a flat
sum covering the entire life of the lien, the privilege of
recording the short-time lien and that of recording the
long-time lien have diffefent taxable values. But classification good for one purpose may be bad for another;
and it does not follow that because the state may classify
for the purpose of proportioning the tax, it may adopt
the same classification to the end that some shall bear
a burden of taxation from which others under circumstances identical in all respects save in respect of the
matter of value, are entirely exempt.
Here it seems clear that a circumstance which affects
only taxable values has been made the basis of a classification under which one is compelled to pay a tax for
the enjoyment of a necessary privilege which, aside from
the amount of the recording fee which is paid by each, is

LOUISVILLE GAS CO. v. COLEMAN.
32

Opinion of the Court.

furnished to another as a pure gratuity. Such a classification is arbitrary. It bears no reasonable or just relation
to the intended result of the legislation. The difference
relied upon is no more substantial, as the sole basis for
the present classification, than a difference in value between two similar pieces of land would be if invoked as
the sole basis for a like classification in respect of such
property. Certainly one who is secured by the state in
the priority of his lien for a period less than five years enjoys a privilege which in kind and character fairly cannot
be distinguished from a like privilege enjoyed by another
for a longer period of time. The former reasonably may
be required to pay proportionately less than the latter;
but to exact, as the price of a privilege which, for obvious
reasons, neither safely can forego, a tax from the latter
not imposed in any degree upon the former produces an
obvious and gross inequality. If the state, upon the same
classification, had reversed the process and taxed indebtedness maturing within a shorter period than five years, and
exempted such as matured in a longer period, the inequality probably would be readily conceded, but the consti-tutionalinfirmity, though more strikingly apparent, would
have been the same.
We are not dealing with a charge made for services
rendered or a fee for regulation, but a tax in the strict sense
of the term. It is said that it is a tax upon a privilege
which the owner or holder of the instrument creating
a lien is free to accept or reject. But for practical purposes there is no such option, for, as this Court recently
held, there is a practical necessity to record such instruments because, if not recorded, the statute overrides them
in favor of purchasers without notice and creditors; and
the choice is like one made under duress. "The State is
not bound to furnish a registry, but if it sees fit to do so
it cannot use its control as a means to impose a liability
that it cannot impose directly, any more than it can es-

cape its constitutional obligations by denying jurisdiction
to its Courts in cases which those Courts axe otherwise
competent to entertain. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the
World, 252 U. S. 411, 415." Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374, 378.
The exemption of building and loan associations from
the operation of the tax is a different matter. The equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not
preclude a state in imposing taxes from making exemptions, provided the power is not exercised arbitrarily. It
may exempt the property of churches, charitable institutions, and the like; and it does not admit of fair doubt
that, under the circumstances disclosed by the opinion of
the court below in the Middendorf case, it has lawfully
exempted building and loan associations. That court
points out that a building and loan association under the
Kentucky statutes must receive payments from members
only and make loans to members only, in pursuance of a
plan set forth. Money accumulated is to be l6aned to
members according to a rule of priority. The essential
principle of such an association is mutuality. The purpose of the statute, the court below says, was to provide
the members of the associations with the means of borrowing money for the acquisition of homes, in recognition
of the duty of the state to encourage the acquisition of
homes by its citizens. Such associations are also placed
by the state statute in a separate class for purposes of ad
valorem taxation. It is made clear by the lower court
that the purpose of the exemption was to enable these
associations, by relieving them of a burden, more completely to carry out the quasi-public purpose which the
legislature designed in providing for their creation. This
exemption, therefore, must be upheld; but, since the effect
of the exemption first considered is to deny plaintiff in
error the equal protection of the law in violation of the

opinion.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES.

When a legal distinction is determined, as no one
doubts that it may be, between night and day, childhood and maturity, or any other extremes, a point has
to be fixed or a line has to be drawn, or gradually picked
out by successive decisions, to mark where the change
takes place. Looked at by itself without regard to the
necessity behind it the line or point seems arbitrary. It
might as well 'or nearly as well be a little more to one
side or the other. But when it is seen that a line or point
there must be, and that there is no mathematical or
logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very
wide of any reasonable mark.
There is a plain distinction between large loans secured by negotiable bonds and mortgages that easily
escape taxation, and small ones to needy borrowers for
which they give their personal note for a short term and
a mortgage of their house. 'I hardly think it would be
denied that the large transactions of the money market
reasonably may be subjected to a tax from which small
ones for private need are exempted. The Legislature of
Kentucky after careful consideration has decided that the
distinction is clearly marked when the loan is for so long
a term as five years. ,Whatever doubt I may feel, I certainly cannot say that it is wrong. If it is right as to the

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS,

dissenting.

Pursuant to power conferred by the Constitution of
Kentucky, its Legislature imposed a recording tax of 20
cents per $100 upon mortgages given to secure loans which
do not mature within five years from the date of the mortgage. The statute discriminates between long and short
term loans as subjects of taxation. A loan maturing in
60 months or more would be subject to the tax, whereas
one maturing in 59 months or less, but otherwise similar
in all respects would not be. The distinction between
long term and short term loans-with differences in yield
for securities otherwise identical in character-is one
familiar to American investment bankers and their clients.
Did the Kentucky Legislature, in adopting that classification for purposes of the mortgage recording tax, exceed
the bounds of that "wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation" which this Court sanctions, as declared
in Lake SuperiorMines v. Lord, 271 U. S. 577, 582, so long
as the State "refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes "?
Classifications based solely on factual differences no
greater than that between a loan maturing in 59 months
or less and one maturing in 60 months or more, have been
sustained in many fields of legislation.' In Citizens TeleI A statute which fixed the maximum rate of fare on railroads more
than 75 miles long, at 3 cents, but on railroads in all other respects
similarly situated, at 5 cents if the line was between 15 and 75 miles

taxation there is a broader power of classification than in

specifically with classification for purpose of taxation on a
basis similar to that here employed, are not discussed in

progressive rates, rising in steps with the amount of the
gift and applying to the entire gift and'not merely to the
excess.' Under the law a legatee of $10,000, being subject
to a 3 per cent. tax, would receive net $9,700; whereas a
legatee of $10,001, being subject to a 4 per cent. tax on the
entire legacy would receive net only $9,600.96: The Court
held the classification reasonable, saying:
"The condition is not arbitrary because it is determined by that value [of the inheritance] ; it is not unequal
in operation because it does not levy the same percentage
on every dollar; does not fail to treat 'all alike under
like circumstances and conditions, both in the privilege
conferred and the liabilities imposed.' The jurisdiction
of courts is fixed by amounts. The-right of appeal is. As
was said at bar the Congress of the United States has
classified the right of suitors to come into the United
States courts by amounts. Regarding these alone, there
is the same inequality that is urged against classification
of the Illinois law. All license laws and all specific taxes
have in them elements of inequality, nevertheless they
are universally imposed and their legality has never been
questioned."
The Court has likewise sustained a statute which imposed an ad valorem tax upon telephone companies with
annual earnings of $500 or more, while exempting others
similarly situated whose, earnings were less than $500,

similar provision in Laws 1905, c. 54. Even where such rates do not
apply to the total amount but only to that over a certain excess,
they seem to violate the standards now laid down by the Coutt.
But since Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283,

the legislature of the State which made the classification,

and members of the court which sanctioned it, necessarily
possessed greater knowledge of local coiditions and needs
than is possible for us, I should have assumed that this
classification, which obviously is not invidious, was a
reasonable one, unless some facts were adduced to show
that it was arbitrary. Compare Heisler v. Thomas Colliery
Co., 260 U. S. 245, 255; Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U. S.
392, 397. No such facts have been adduced by the

may take judicial notice, McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande
R. R. Co., 203 U. S. 38, 50; Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S.

Legislature of Kentucky in an effort to equalize the tax
burden incident to loans.
The mortgage recording tax is a feature Qf the revenue
system of at least nine states.' Its purpose in all is substantially the same-to supply an effective means for
reaching this form of intangible property, which is likely
to evade taxation under the general property tax. The
recording tax is commonly accompanied either by a complete exemption of mortgage securities from other property taxation or, as in Kentucky, by exemption of such

securities from local taxation alone. "As imposed in Alabama and New York, the states which first adopted it,
the tax is levied at the same rate irrespective of the length
of the loan. The obvious unfairness of such an arrangement, both to the short term borrower and to the State,
has been one of the chief objections to adoption of the
tax.' Other states, impressed with the general- efficiency
of the tax, have attempted to eliminate the unfairness
produced by the fiat rate. Thus, in Oklahoma, the rates
are 2 cents per $100 for loans of less than 2 years, 4 cents
where the loan is for 2 years or more, 6 cents where for 3
or more, 8 cents where for 4 or more, and 10 cents where
for 5 or more.9 In South Dakota, the tax was 10 cents per
$100 per year or fraction thereof, with a proviso that in
no event should the tax be more than 50 cents per $100.'
Such taxes obviate only in part the objection urged
against the flat rate tax, namely, that mortgages for a
long term are taxed, proportionally, at a lower rate than
those for a short. In Minnesota, which had originally
enacted the flat rate tax," a different expedient was devised. In 1913 it was provided that the tax should be 15
cents per $100 unless the loan was for more than 5
S This objection to the flat rate tax was brought to the attention
of the Kentucky commission of 1916 in a brief filed on behalf of the
Louisville Real Estate Board, though the Board itself favored the
flat rate plan. See letter of Mr. A. E. Holcomb criticizing the New
York law, p. 41; letter of Mr. George Lord criticizing the Michigan
law, p. 45. See also Report of Committee of National Tax Association on Taxation of Personal Property, 1911; Repor of Minnesota

years, in which event the tax was to be 25 cents. 12 In
Minnesota the discrimination between long and short
term securiti6s is thus 10 cents per $100; in Kentucky it
is 20 cents. But the distinction and the reasons for it are
substantially the same.
The mortgage recording tax was adopted in Kentucky
only after the most serious 'consideration. It was part
of the general system of taxation enacted in 1917 after
investigations by two special tax commissions appointed
to enquire into the particular needs of the State. In the
.reports of both commissions the fact that theretofore
mortgage loans had largely escaped taxation was a subject of much consideration."3 The first commission,
which was appointed in 1912, submitted a preliminary
report recommending an amendment to the state constitution so as to permit the classification of property for
purposes of taxation and the application of different
methods of taxation to different classes. The amendment proposed was submitted to the people and adopted.
Kentucky Constitution, ยง 171. In December, 1913, the
commission submitted its final report. It recommended,
among other things, that mortgages, bonds and other
choses in action "be taxed by a method which will bring
them out of hiding"." It submitted with the report a
draft of a bill for the taxation of intangibles, but recommended that the bill should not be passed until the subject had received further study by another commission.
The second commission filed its report in 1916. Like
the first commission, it adverted to the fact that "even in

the case of mortgages numerous ingenious and decidedly
reprehensible methods are resorted to, in order that the
real owfier of such securities may escape his lawful portion
of the burden of taxes," and it recommended, among
other things, the imposition of a mortgage recording tax."'
This was passed at an extraordinary session of the legislature called "for the sole purpose of considering the subject of revenue and taxation," which remained in session
from February 14 to April 25, 1917. The legislation subjected different classes of intangible property to widely
varying rates and supplemented the property taxes by
license fees, including the mortgage recording tax here in
question. It subjected credits secured by mortgage to the
annual general property tax of 40 cents per $100 for state
purposes but exempted them from local taxation; imposed
the mortgage recording tax; and retained a statute then in
force laying a fiat recording tax of 50 cents on all mortgages (except chattel mortgages for less than $200).
Kentucky Statutes; Carroll's 1922 edition, ยง 4238. We are
told that the commission and the Legislature concluded
that the taxes imposed by the several statutes would, in
view of facts to be stated, approximately equalize the pro
rata amount of taxes to be paid on loans secured by mortgage, taking account of the difference in the dates of maturity. In determining whether the equal treatment
required by the Federal Constitution has been afforded we
must, of 'ourse, consider all the statutes operating upon
the subject matter. Farmers& Mechanics Savings Bank
v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 529; Interstate Busses Corporationv. Blodgett, 276 U. S.245.

In Kentucky local reasons exist for treating long term
mortgage loans somewhat differently from those for a

short term. There is among those loans which are secured
by mortgages of real or personal property, and hence require registration, commonly a marked difference in the
character of the short term and the long term loans.
Probably 90 or 95 per cent of the short term loans are
evidenced by promissory notes payable to the lender.
The larger part are for amounts less than $300, many of
them maturing within a few months and providing for
the payment of interest in advance. Another large part
consists of loans secured by mortgage upon the residence
of the borrower and made for domestic purposes. On the
other hand, the long term loans are commonly evidenced
by coupon bonds; are issued for large amounts; and represent borrowings for business purposes. The rate of interest on short term mortgage loans is generally higher
than that on long term loans of equal safety, in part for
the following reason. Because the short term loans are
usually evidenced by promissory notes payable to the
lender, the registration of the mortgage discloses the identity of the holder of the notes; and he is commonly subjected to the tax of 40 cents per $100 imposed by law
upon all mortgage loans.1 6 Because the long term lohns
are commonly represented by negotiable coupon bonds
and are secured by a deed of trust, registration- does not
disclose to the assessors who the holders of the securities
are, and they frequently escape taxation thereon., Laying
the mortgage recording tax only upon the long term loans
tends in some measure to reduce the disadvantage under
which the short term borrower labors.
At what-point the line should be drawn between short
term and long term loans is, of course, a matter on which
even men conversant with all the facts may reasonably
differ. There was much difference of opinion concerning
this in the Kentucky Legislature. The bill, as recom16 Acts Special Session, 1917, c. 11, ยง 1. By Acts 1924, c. 116, ยง 1,

mended by the Tax Commission, and as introduced in the
House, exempted from the tax here in question only such
mortgages as secured indebtedness maturing within three
years; and it imposed a tax of 25 cents for $100.7 In the
House, the bill was amended so as to exempt loans maturing in less than five years.' 8 In the Senate, the House bill
was amended so as to reduce the period to three years."
The House refused to concur in the Senate amendment. 0
The Senate receded; 21 and thereupon the bill was passed

granting the exemption of loans maturing within five
years, but with the rate reduced to 20 cents.2 Thus, we
know that in making this particular classification there
was in fact an exercise of legislative judgment and discretion. Surely the particular classification was not such " as
to preclude [in law] the assumption that it was made in
the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion." See
Stebbins v. Riiey, 268 U. S. 137, 143. Whether the exercise was a wise one is not our concern.
That it was permissible for Kentucky, in levying its
mortgage recording tax, to take account of the probability
that certain types of mortgage would escape further taxation, is not open to doubt. Watson v. State Comptroler,
254 U. S. 122, 125. There is abundant proof that the
legislature was justified in thinking that -the bulk of the
long term loans would escape the general- property tax,
while most of those for a short term would not. That
the statute taxes certain long term loans which, because
of their similarity in other respects to those for a short
term, are likely to be subjected to the state property tax,

would not render the statute invalid even as applied to
them. Compare Citizens Teleplione Co. v. Fuller, 229
U. S.322, 332. Wherever the line might be drawn, the
statute would sometimes operate unjustly. But such occasional instances of injustice would not render the classification arbitary. As was said in Metropolis Theatre Co.
v. Chicago, 228 U. S. 61, 69, 70: "The problems of goVernment are practical ones and may justify, -if
they do
not require, rough accommodations-illogical, it may be,

and unscientific."
Moreover, the deed of trust here in question is not
similar to the Kentucky mortgages maturing within five
years. It is a deed of trust given by a public service
corporation to secure $150,000,000 in thirty-year 5 per
cent. coupon bonds of $1,000 each, the bonds to be issued
from time to time, .the initial issue being $18,805,000.
The equality clause would not prevent a State from confining the recording tax to deeds of trust given to secure
bond of a, public service corporation. Compare Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S. 321, 338; Bell's Gaip
Railroad Ca. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232, 237; Pacific
Express Co. v. Seibert, 142 U. S. 339, 351; American
Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S.89, 92; Hatch
v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 158. The characteristics of
this deed. of trust clearly furnish a basis for reasonable
classification as compared with probably every mortgage
exempted from the recording tax. If the statute as applied does not in fact discriminatd in favor of any property of a like nature, there is not inequality in treatment.
A "tax is not to be upset upon hypothetical and unreal
possibilities, if it would be good upon the facts as they
are.' Pullman Co. v. Knott, 235 U. S.23, 26. See Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi,257 U. S.129, 137, 138.

here involved and as there is no showing that there exist
any similar deeds of trust securing loans for less than five
years, no constitutional right of the plaintiff is invaded
because the statute may also include loans actually similar to those exempted except in regard to their term, and
which, because similar in fact, could not be treated differently from those exempt. Clark v. Kansas City, 176
U. S. 114,. 117-118; Aluminum Co. v. Ramsey, 222 U. S.

strike down a statute must show not only that he is
affected by it, but that as applied to him, the statute
exceeds the power of the State. This rule, acted upon
as early as Austin v. The Aldermen,.7 Wall. 694, and definitely stated in Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U. S. 305, 314,
has been consistently followed since that time. In my
