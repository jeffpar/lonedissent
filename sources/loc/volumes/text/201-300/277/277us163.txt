SPROUT v. CITY OF SOUTH BEND.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIANA.

No. 208. Submitted January 20, 1928.-Decided May 14, 1928.
Plaintiff in error operated a motor bus for passengers between a city
in Indiana and points in Michigan. He required all passengers
from the city to pay fare to Michigan, but habitually allowed
those desiring to do. so to alight in the suburbs short of the state
line. He objected to an ordinance of the city which forbade operation of motor buses in the city streets unless licensed by the city
and which conditioned the issuance of licenses upon payment of a
fee adjusted to the seating capacity of the bus-in his case $50and upon the filing of a contract of liability insurance, to be furnished by a corporation authbrized to do business in the State,
covering damages to property or persons from negligent operation
of the bus within the city. Held1. The requirement that the insurance must be by a company
authorized to do business in Indiana did not violate the rights of
the plaintiff in error under the Fourteenth Amendment, because
it was reasonable as applied to his case. P. 167.
2. Objection that this requirement discriminates against insurance companies not authorized to do business in Indiana is not open
to plaintiff in error. Id.
3. The suburban traffic was not interstate commerce, since the
destination intended by the passenger when he begins his journey
and known to* the carrier, determines the character of the com.7
merce. P. 168.
4. As respects the-interstate commerce, the license fee cannot, be
sustained as one exacted to defray expenses of regulating traffic for
the public safety and convenience, it not appearing that such fees
were imposed or applied for that purpose, or that the amount collected was no more than was reasonably required for it. P. 169,

5. The license fee cannot be sustained as a charge imposed on
motor vehicles as their fair contribution to the cost of constructing
and maintaining highways, it being a flat tax, substantial in amount,
the same for buses plying the streets continually as for those making only a single trip daily, and there being no suggestion in the
language of the ordinance or its construction by the state court
that the proceeds are in any part to be applied to such construction
or maintenance. P. 170.
6. The license fee cannot be sustained as an occupation tax,
because not shown to be imposed solely on account of the intrastate
business. P. 171.

it concerns damages suffered by persons other than passengers, is
not an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Id.

ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana,
which affirmed a'judgment for a penalty inflicted on
Sprout for violating an ordinance of the city which forbade operation of motor buses without a license.
Mr. Dudley M. Shively, with whom Messrs. Isaac K.
Parks, Frank Gilmer, and Walter R. Arnold were on the
brief, submitted for plaintiff in error.
If the ordinance be held valid as not a burden on interstate commerce, then a like ordinance in the State of
Michigan would be upheld on the 'same principle. Result: Every city and village through which an exclusively
interstate carrier would be obliged to effect a passage from
Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Indianapolis, Indiana, could
make similar exactions. Thirty-three municipal corporations each compelling the payment of a $50.00 annual
license fee (to say nothing of the $200.00 tax), a total of
$1,650.00, for the privilege of making, say, only two trips
a month between the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
the city of Indianapolis, Indiana. And if the trip be extended further, into Kentucky, proportionately more. It
was precisely to avert such unconscionable practices that

the interstate commerce clause was written into the Federal Constitution.
Besides leaving each village, town and city to exact such
tribute, nothing. was to prevent each village, town and
city-under the holding of the Indiana Supreme Courtfrom requiring the carrier to take out insurance in companies in Indiana. No end to the qualifications and specifications touching the companies in Which the insurance
must be taken before licenses can be issued by the several
municipalities. Each at liberty to make requirements entirely inconsistent with all the others. The municipalities
of Michigan (and of Kentucky, if the course of carriage
be extended to that State) would, naturally, not be content with a policy of insurance written in some corporation of Indiana.

MR. JusTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
By ordinance adopted in 1921, South Bend, Indiana,
prohibited, with exceptions not here material, the operation on its streets of any motor bus for hire unless
licensed by the city. Sprout, a resident of that State,
operated regularly a bus with seats for twelve persons
between points within South Bend and the City of Niles,
Michigan. He paid the state registration fee but refused to apply for a city license. In 1923, he was prosecuted by the city in a local court for violation of the
ordinance and defended on the ground that it was invalid
as applied to him. The case was heard on agreed facts.
Sprout claimed, among other things, that the ordinance
violated the commerce clause and the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These claims
were overruled; a penalty of $50 was imposed; and the
judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the highest
court of the State, 198 Ind. 563. The case is here on
writ of error. Compare John P. King Manufacturing
Co. v. City Council of Augusta, ante p. 100.

SPROUT v. SOUTH BEND.
163

.167

Opinion of the Court.

The ordinance prescribes license fees varying with the
seating capacity of the bus. That for a bus with seats
for twelve persons is $50 a year. Before the license can
issue, the applicant must file with the city a contract of
liability insurance providing for the payment of any final
judgment that may be rendered for damages to property
or the person resulting from the negligent operation of
the bus within the city. The amount of insurance required is limited to a liability of $1,000 to any one person
and of $2,500 for damages arising from a single accident.
The insurance must be furnished by a company authorized to do business within the State. These requirements
apply alike to busses operating wholly within the city and
to those operating from points within it to points without. The ordinance makes no distinction between busses
engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, those engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, and those engaged in both classes of commerce. Nor does the ordinance, in its requirement of liability insurance, distinguish in terms between liability to passengers traveling
interstate and other liability resulting from negligent
operation.
The claim that the ordinance violates the Fourteenth
Amendment is rested mainly upon the ground that
Sprout is required to furnish insurance issued by a company authorized to do business in Indiana. That contention may be quickly disposed of. The provision limiting the insurance to such companies is obviously a reasonable one so far as Sprout is concerned. Compare La
Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S; 465, 468. The further
objection that the requirement discriminates against insurance companies not authorized to do business within
the State is not open to the plaintiff in error. Cronin v.
Adams, 192 U. S. 108, 114; Erie R. R. Co. v. Williams,

Southwestern Ry. Co., 249 U. S. 134, 149.

168

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

The claim that the ordinance violates the commerce
clause presents questions requiring serious consideration.
Sprout did not carry passengers from one point in South
Bend to another. He was not a local carrier. Primarily
his business was interstate. But the agreed facts show
that he was not engaged exclusively in interstate commerce. The distance from the north city limits of South
Bend to Niles is about nine miles.. Half of this distance
lies within Indiana. Along the highway traversed within that State lie many suburban residences and one
village tributary to South Bend. Sprout purported to
offer transportation from that city only to persons destined to points in Michigan. He required that all passengers from South Bend pay the fare to some Michigan
point. But, in fact, he served suburban passengers. He
made stops habitually at points within Indiana in order
to permit passengers from South Bend to leave the bus
before the state-line was reached. The legal character
of this suburban bus traffic was not affected by the device
of requiring the payment of a fare fixed for some Michigan point or by Sprout's professing that he sought only
passengers destined to that State. The actual facts
govern. For this purpose, the destination intended by
the passenger when he begins his journey and known to
the carrier, determines the character of the commerce.
Compare Philadelphia &6Reading Ry. Co. v. Hancock,
253 U. S.284; Baltimore& Ohio R. R. Co. v. Settle, 260
U. S. 166, 171. The suburban traffic was intrastate
commerce.
The Supreme Court of Indiana did not pass upon the
question whether Sprout, by reason of the suburban traffic,
was engaged also in intrastate traffic. Nor did it consider whether his rights as an interstate carrier would be
affected by his engaging also in intrastate business. It
affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the broad
ground that, since Sprout made use of the streets in "the

SPROUT v. SOUTH BEND.
163

Opinion of the Court.

indiscriminate solicitation and acceptance of passengers,"
he was "within the police power of the state to license
and regulate both driver and vehicle by way of-providing
for the safety, security and general welfare of the public."
It is true that, in the absence of federal legislation covering the subject, the State may impose, even upon vehicles
using the highways exclusively in interstate commerce,
non-discriminatory regulations for the purpose of insuring
the public safety and convenience; that licensing or-registration of busses is a measure appropriate to that end;
and that a license fee no larger in amount than is reasonlably required to defray the expense of administering the
regulations may be demanded. Hendrick v. Maryland,
235 U. S. 610, 622; Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. 160;
Morris v. Duby, 274 U. S, 135; Clark v. Poor, 274 U. S.
554. Compare Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U. S. 352. These
powers-may also be exercised by a city if authorized to
do so by appropriate legislation. Compare Erb v.
Morasch, 177 U. S. 584, 585; Mackay Telegraph Co. v.
Little Rock, 250 U. S. 94, 99. Such regulations rest for
their validity upon the same basis as do state inspection
laws, Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, 171
U. S. 345; Red " C" Oil Co. v. Board of Agriculture, 222
U. S. 380, and municipal ordinances imposing on telegraph companies, though engaged in interstate commerce,
a tax to defray the expense incident to the inspection of
poles and wires. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. New
Hope, 187 U. S. 419; Postal Telegraph-CableCo. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 258; Mackay Telegraph Co. v. Little
Rock, 250 U. S. 94, 99., But it does not appear that the
license fee here in question was imposed as an incident
of such a scheme of municipal regulation; nor that the
proceeds were applied to defraying- the expenses of such
regulation; nor that the amount collected under the ordinance was no more than was reasonably required for such
a purpose. It follows that the-exaction of the license fee

170

277 U. S.

cannot be sustained as a police measure. Atlantic &
Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, 190 U. S. 160, 164;
Postal-Telegraph Cable Co. v. New Hope, 192 U. S. 55;
Adams Express Co. v. New York, 232 U. S. 14, 32. Compare Foote & Co. v. Stanley, 232 U. S.494, 503.
It is true also that a State may impose, even on motor
vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, a
reasonable charge as their fair contribution to the cost of
constructing and maintaining the public highways. Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S.610, 622; Interstate Busses
Corporationv. Blodgett, 276 U. S.245. And this power
also may be delegated in part to a municipality by appropriate legislation. Compare St. Louis v. Western
Union Telegraph Co., 148 U. S.92, 98; 149 U. S. 465. An
exaction for that purpose may be included in a license
fee. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Kane v. New Jersey,
242 U. S.160, 168-169; Clark v. Poor, 274 U. S.554. But
no part of the license fee here in question may be assumed to have been prescribed for that purpose. A flat
tax, substantial in amount and the same for busses plying
the streets continuously in local service and for busses
making, as do many interstate busses, only a single trip
daily, could hardly have been designed as a measure of the
cost or value of the use of the highways. And there is
no suggestion, either in the language of the ordinance or
in the construction put upon it by the Supreme Court of
Indiana, that the proceeds of the license fees are, in any
part, to be applied to the construction or maintenance of
the city streets. Compare Tomlinson v. City of Indianapolis, 144 Ind. 142; City of Terre Haute v. Kersey, 159
Ind.300; Hogan v. City of Indianapolis,159 Ind.523.
It follows that on the record before us the exaction of
the license fee cannot be sustained either as an inspection
fee or as an excise for the use of the streets of the city.
It remains to .consider whether it can be sustained as an
occupation tax. A State may, by appropriate legisla-

tion, require. payment of an occupation tax from one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. Postal
Telegraph Cable Co. v. Charleston,153 U. S. 692; Osborne
v. Florida,164 U. S. 6 50; Kehrer v. Stewart, 197 U. S. 60;
Watters v. Michigan, 248 U. S. 65; Raley & Bros. v. Richardson, 264 U. S. 157. Compare Interstate Busses Corporationv. Holyoke Street Ry. Co., 273 U. S. 45; Arnold
v. Hanna,276 U. S. 591. And it may delegate a part of
that power to a municipality. Compare Postal TelegraphCable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 257. Butin order
.that the fee or tax shall be valid, it must appear that
it is imposed solely on account of the intrastate business;
that the amount exacted is not increased because of the
interstate business done; that one engaged exclusively
in interstate commerce would not be subject to the imposition; and that the person taxed could discontinue the
intrastate business without withdrawing also from the
interstate business. Leloup v. Port of Mobile, 127 U. S.
640; Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, 58; Adams Express Co. v. New York, 232 U. S. 14, 30; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., 256 U. S. 642, 647. Compare Williams
v. Talladega, 226 'U. S. -404, 417; Postal Telegraph-Cable
Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252. The Supreme Court of
Indiana, far from construing the ordinance as applicable
solely to busses engaged in intrastate commerce, assumed
that 4t applied to busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce and that Sprout was so engaged. The
privilege of engaging in such commerce is one which a
State cannot deny. Buck v. Kuykendall, 267 U. S. 307;
Bush & Sons Co. v. Maloy, 267 U. S. 317. A State is
equally inhibited from conditioning its exercise 'on the
payment of an occupation tax.
Objection under the commerce clause is-made also to
the requirement of liability insurance. There being grave
dangers incident to the operation of motor vehicles, a
State may require users of such vehicles on the public

for the payment of judgments recovered for certain injuries, resulting from their operation. Packardv. Banton,

160, 167; Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U. S. 352; Clark v. Poor,
274 U. S. 554, 557. It may, consistently with the Federal
Constitution, delegate by appropriate legislation a part
of this power to a municipalty. Such provisions for insurance are not, even as applied to busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, an unreasonable burden on
that commerce, if limited to damages suffered within the
State by persons other than the passenger. Whether the
insurance here prescribed is, because of its scope, obnoxious to the commerce clause, we need not inquire. Compare Adams Express Co. v. New York, 232 U. S. 14, 33;
Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, 266 U. S.
