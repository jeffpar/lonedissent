ERROR TO THM SUPREME COURT OF KAiSAS.

Nos. 407 to 418, inclusive. Argued April 25, 1928.-Decided May 14,
1928.

1. A state statute maldng a bank director individually liable for deposits,-the receipt of which by the bank was assented to by him
with knowledge that it was insolvent, and which provides that his
failure to examine the bank's affairs to learn of its condition shall
charge him with knowledge of its insolvency, and that in suits
against him for such deposits the fact of insolvency when the
deposits were received shall be prima facie evidence that the-director both knew of the- insolvency, and assented to the deposits-

held consistent with due process of law. P. 94.
2. The statute might have made directors liable to depositors in
every case. By accepting the office, they assume the risks it
imposes. Id.

Messrs. J. B. McKay and L. J. Bond were on the brief

Want of knowledge being a defense, the defendant in
an action of this kind has the right -to prove want of
knowledge, and the effect of the statute creating against
the officer a conclusive presumption of knowledge, is to

The statute attempts to establish rules of evidence
under which the depositor may-prove his case against the
directors. It. doe not. enact a rule of substantive law.
To give the statute the -effect which the Kansas Court
announces, the statute would have to read that every
director shall be liable to depositors if -he fails to make
an examination of the bank.. The liability is based.upon
assent after knowledge of insolvency, and the conclusive
presumption- raised is a method provided for proving
knowledge. Conceding for the moment the power of the
legislature to establish a 'rule of absolute- liability upon
the part of a director who failed to examine, it is plain
that the-legislature had no intention-of so doing.: Wh t
the legislature did intend was- to 'ftiake it 'easier for the
depositor to prove his csge.: &hlesinper v. Wisconsin,

placing such a liability:upon the directors withoui regard
to whether such neglect of duty to examine occasioned

award compensatory damages to the depositors because
of the failure to examine, is to take the property of the
directors without due process of law, because their neglect
had no causal relation to the injury. 29 Cyc., 439;
Hodgson v. Dexter, 12 Fed. Cas. 6565, affirmed, 1 Cranch
345.
The statute very positively creates not a "mere prima
facie presumption," but a conclusive presumption against
a director who does not examine.
Section 9-164 is, we contend, also violative of the
Fourteenth Amendment, but for a somewhat different
reason. It is the rule as stated in many of the authorities, that even a prima, fade presumption cannot be
created where there is no rational or logical connection
between the fact upon which the presumption is to rest
and the fact to be proved. The existence of the established fact must reasonably tend to raise an inference of
the main fact. Now how can it be said that the fact that
a bank is insolvent reasonably tends to raise an inference
that its officers assented to its receiving deposits? Ordinarily courts do not assume that persons intend to violate
the law. McFarlandv. American Sugar Co., 241 U. S. 79.
The statute here provides that proof of insolvency shall
constitute prima facie evidence not only of knowledge,
but of assent. Therefore, inasmuch as assent is based in
part upon knowledge, the statute provides for a presumption upon a presumption. One presumption cannot be
based on another presumption. Railroad Co. v. Baumgartner, 74 Kans. 148; United States v. Ross, 92 U. S.
281; Manning v. John Hancock Ins. Co., 100 U. S. 693;
Cunard Co. v. Keley, 126 Fed. 610; 10 R. C. L., 870;
Duncanv. Railroad,82 Kans. 230.
To provide that knowledge and assent are to be presumed from insolvency is to say that proof of insolvency
presumes knowledge, and from this presumption of
knowledge, assent is presumed. This cannot be legally
done. Simpkins v. State, 249 Pae. 168.

Mr. S. M. Brewster, with whom Mesrs. John L. Hunt
and Brdce A. Campbell were on the brief, for Harris.
Section 9-164, Revised Statutes of Kansas, is. unconstitutional as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,
because it seeks to create a prima acie presumption of
assent by proof of a fact entirely unrelated to the main
fact sought to be established. Railway Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U.:S.'35; Hawes v. Georgia, 285 -U. S: 1; Manning v. John. Hancock Ins. -Co., 100 U. S. 693; Li.ria v.
United States, 231 U. 5.9; McFarlandv. Ameican Sugar
Co., 241 U. S. 79; Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U. S. 219. And
because it deprives plaintiff in error and his decedent's
estate of property without due process of law by creating
a presumption which is based upon a presumption. 5

Section 9-163 violated the Fourteenth Amendinent in
that it required the decedent to do the impossible, and

Hoi;mS' delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These writs of error are brought b~y Ferry, formerl3f a
director of the Butler County State Bank, -of Kansas,
and by the executor of a deceased director, to set aside
judgments against themi -in suits by depiositors in the
bank, on-the ground that the statutes .of Kansas pur-.
jorthig to' establish the -directors' liability were contrary to tlie Fourteenth Aniendment '6 the Constitution
of the United States. -The itatutes were upheld by the
State Court. 122 Kans. 675. Ibid. 691.The plaintiffs, (the'defendants in errbr,) made deposits

cess of law by creating a conclusive presumption of
knowledge from ignorance -and by implying that the director knowingly assented to a deposit that he should not
have received, of which in fact he knew nothing. As to
164: it is said that facts are made prima facie evidence of
other facts that they have no rational tendency io prove.
The law as construed by the Supreme Court of Kansas
meets its severest test in the cases against the executor
of Kramer, because Kramer, although not so igncrant or
incapable of knowledge as thought by the Court of first
instance, was seriously ill at the time of the deposits and
seemed to have much to be said in his behalf, if the actual
state of his knowledge had any relevancy as an excuse.
It is said that the liability is founded by the .statute
upon the directors' assent to the deposit and that when
this is the ground the assent cannot be proved by artificial
presumptions that have no warrant from experience.
But the short answer is that the statute might have made
the directors personally liable to depositors in every case,
if it had been so minded, and that if it had purported to
do so, whoever accepted the office would assume the risk.
The statute in short imposed a liability that was less
than might have been imposed, and that being so, the
thing to be considered is the result reached, not the possibly inartificial.or clumsy way of reaching it. If without
any mention of assent or presumptions or prima facie
evidence the statute had said: 'Every director of a bank
shall be personally liable to depositors for every. deposit
accepted by the bank after it has become insolvent,' all
objections would be met by the answer, 'You took the
office on those terms.' The statute would be none the
worse if it allowed a defence in the single case of the defendants having made an honest examination and having
been led to believe that the bank was solvent. The
mention of assent and evidence of knowledge cannot be
pressed to conclusions that the statute manifestly does

FERRY v. RAMSEY.
88

JJ., dissenting.

not allow. The conclusions that, as construed by the
State Court, it does imp6se, it imposes however much it
may cut down the significance of the assent or knowledge
to which it refers. As a matter of 1aw there is nothing
new in charging a party with knowledge of what it is his
duty to know, in this case the insolvenc- of the bank, or
with assent to deposits that he must expect while the
bank's doors remain open. But the essential thing is
that, whether in a roundabout or a perfectly natural way,
the statute has iaid if you take the office you must take
the consequences of knowledge whether you have it or
not. In most contracts men take the risk of events over
which they have imperfect or no control. The acceptance of a directorship is as voluntary an act as a contract.
The Supreme Court of Kansas affirmed judgments
against Ferry and reversed judgments in favor of the
executor of Kramer based on Kram'er's incapacity to
know of or assent to the deposits in question and ordered
judgments against him. In. so doing it violated no provision of the Constitution of the United States.

Judgments affirmed.
MR. JUSTI CE SuzaERLAw, -dissenting.
In respect of the prima facie presumption created by
§ 9-164 of the Kansas statute, I am unable to agree with
the opinion of the Court insofar as that section affects
the cases against Harris, Executor of the Will of Kramer,
deceased. The evidence shows v6ry clearly that, at the
time the deposits in question were made and for a long
time prior thereto, Kramer was.physically incapable of
investigating and ascertaining the condition- of the bank,
or of assenting to the reception of deposits.by the bank,
because of his serious illness which resulted in his death
after undergoing a major surgical operation. It was substantially so found by the jury in one of the cases and by
the trial court in the others. Under these circumstances,

96

OCTOBER TERM, 1027.
SuTaHs1.AD, BumnFt, and SAwOaD, JJ., dissenting. 277 U.S.

the application of the statutory presumption was ob-

viously injurious. Section 9-163 provides that it shall be
unlawful for any president, director, etc., to assent to the
reception of deposits, etc., after he shall have had knowledge of the fact that the bank is insolvent.

Section 9-164,

which creates the objectionable presumption, provides
that "the fact that such banking institution was so insolvent or in failing circumstances at the time of the reception of the deposit charged to have been so received
*

.

* shall be prima facie evidence of such

.

.

as-

sent to such deposit . . . on the part of such officer
• . " Of course, the state may provide that proof of
one fact shall be prima facie evidence of another; but this
can be done consistently with the due process of law clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment only where there is a rational relation between the two facts. Bailey v. Alabama,
219 U. S. 219, 238; McFarlandv. American Sugar Co., 241
U. S. 79, 86. In the latter case this Court said, quoting
from Mobile, J. & K. C. R. R. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S.
35, 43:
"It is 'essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of
another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely
arbitrary mandate."'
To me it seems clear that there is no rational relation
between the fact of insolvency 'and the fact here presumed,
namely, assent to the reception of a particular deposit.
Rather, the rational presumption is the other way, since
the law itself requires that an insolvent bank shall not receive deposits; and the assent of the director thereto
would be an assent to a violation of law. I do not quarrel
with the suggestion that it was within the constitutional
power of the state to create an absolute liability against
a director if, while insolvent, the bank of which he is a
director receive a deposit. But this the state did not do.

LARSON CO. v. WRIGLEY CO.

Syllabus.

-

-

Instead, ii adopted. a statute-creating a liability only in
case the director assents to the deposit; and I.should have
supposed the liability of -the director imust be measured
by what the state has enacted and n6t by what it had the
power to enact, Under such a statute, without more, it
is perfectly plain that proof by the state of such assent
would be fiecessary. But here the state by legislative fiat
substituted for such proof on its part the prima facie presumption set forth. It was said that the bank was open
and doing business and that it is a reasonable presumption
from that fact that assent was given to the receipt of particular deposits. But we are dealing with a specific statutory provision and must take it as we find it; and by that
provision the general transaction of business by the bank
at the time it received the particular deposits is not made
the basis of the statutory presumption. If it were, a different question would be presented. Under these circumstances, as'it seems to me, the rule, requiring a rational
connectilon-between the fact proved and the ultimate fact
to be presumed therefrom, plainly applies; and- consequently the statutory provision in question is void.
