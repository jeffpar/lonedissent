Opinion of the Court.

States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Union Bank & Trust
Co., 228 Fed. 448, 455. The rule would go for naught if,
by claiming indemnity instead of subrogation, the surety
could achieve the same result. The same policy against
permitting a surety to compete with the creditor for the
insolvent debtor's assets requires that the surety be denied
subrogation to security given to a creditor for several debts
for only one of which the surety is obligated. National
Blank of Commerce v. Rockefeller, 174 Fed. 22. Similar
reasoning underlies the requirement of equity that the
surety who holds the security of an insolvent debtor must
give the benefit of it to the creditor for whom he is surety,
until the debt is fully paid. See Keller v. Ashford, 133
U. S. 610; Hampton v. Phipps, 108 U. S. 260; Chamberlain v. St. Paul, 92 U. S. 299, 306; 2 Pomeroy, Equitable
Remedies (2d ed.) § 925.
Wherever equitable principles are called in play, as they
preeminently are in determining the rights and liabilities
of sureties and in the distribution of insolvents' estates,
they likewise forbid the surety to secure by independent
contract with the debtor indemnity at the expense of the
creditor whose claim he has undertaken to secure.

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS

No. 16, Original.

Return to Rule submitted April 9, 1928.--Decided
May -21, 1928.

1. A refusal of a district judge to call in two other judges for the final
hearing of a case governed by Jud. Code § 266, as amended; is
remediable in this Court by a writ of mandamus. P. 269.
2. A case does not fall within Jud. Code § 266 unless a statute, or
an order of an administrative board or commission, is challenged as
contrary to the Federal Constitution. P. 271.

3. An assessment of railroad property for taxation, made by a state
board, is not an "order" within the meaning of Jud. Code § 266,
and, therefore, in a suit to enjoin collection of taxes under it upon
the ground of systematic and intentional discrimination against
plaintiff by the board in making the assessment, the application
for a preliminary injunction may be heard by a single judge. P. 271.
4. Under Jud. Code § 266, as amended February 13, 1925, the final
hearing is not required to be before three judges, unless the application for an interlocutory injunction was required to be. P. 273.
Rule discharged.

UPoN a return submitted by District Judge Woodrough in answer' to a rule to show cause why a writ of
mandamus should not issue requiring him to call in two
other judges for the final hearing of an injunction suit.
Williams, the Tax Commissioner of Nebraska, and
seventy-one county treasurers were the petitioners for
the writ.
Messrs. 0. S. Spillman, Attorney General of Nebraska,
George L. Basye, and Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorneys General, were on the brief for petitioners.
Hon. Joseph W. Woodrough, District Judge, made return and appeared for himself.
MR JusTICE BRANDEis delivered the opinion of the
Court.

This is a petition by Williams, the tax commissioner of
Nebraska, and 71 county treasurers asking for a writ of
mandamus to be directed to District Judge Woodrough of
the federal court for that State. A rule to show cause
issued, 276 U. S. 597; and the return has been made. The
petitioners are the defendants in a suit in equity commenced in that court by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
Railroad Company. When the cause was ripe for final
hearing, they moved the district judge to call to his assistance two other federal judges, as provided in § 266 of

the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of March 4,
1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013, and the Act of February 13,
1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938. Judge Woodrough denied
the motion and set the case for final hearing, stating
that "the object and purpose of this action is to enjoin
the collection of taxes against plaintiff's property by defendants county treasurers . . . and there is no injunction issued, allowed or prayed for to restrain the
action of any officer of the state of Nebraska and that the
defendants county treasurers are not officers of the state
of Nebraska" within the meaning of § 266 as amended.
The petitioners contend that they are entitled as of right
to have the case heard before three judges. Mandamus is
the appropriate remedy. Ex parte MetropoZitan Water
Co., 220 U. S. 539, 546.
Nebraska has provided for the assessment of railroad
property by a State Board of Equalization. Compiled
Statutes, 1922, §§ 5839, 5840. After the board completes
its valuation, it is required to return to the county clerk
of every county in which the railroad has property, a
statement showing the proportion of the railroad that
lies within the county, its average valuation per mile, and
the valuations that shall be placed to tle credit of each
of the governmental subdivisions of the county. The
board is authorized to fix the rate of taxation for state
purposes; and it transniits to the county clerk a statement of the rate so established. The county treasurers are
ex officio collectors of all taxes levied within their respective counties whether for state or for local purposes.
§§ 5847-5850, 5904, 5905, 5996.
The Railroad seeks in its suit to enjoin the collection of
the taxes for 1923 on the ground that the equality clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated in making
the assessment. It alleged that its property was assessed
by the state board at 122% of its actual value, while the
property of other taxpayers was assessed locally at not

270

Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S.

more than 60% of its value; that this discrimination was
systematic and intentional; that the valuation of its property fixed by the state board had been certified to the
clerks of the various counties and entered on the tax lists;
that the taxes were about to become delinquent; and that
the Company was without adequate remedy at law. It
prayed that the court fix the percentage of the tax levied
which it should pay to the county treasurers in tentative
settlement, for a temporary restraining order, and for interlocutory and final injunctions. Pursuant to an order
of the district judge, the motion for an interlocutory injunction came on for hearing, in November, 1923, before
a court of three judges constituted as provided in § 266
of the Judicial Code. Because certain of the legal questions presented were deemed similar to those involved in
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Osborne, 265
U. S. 14, thel, pending in this Court, the interlocutory
injunction was granted.
The Osborne case was decided on April 28, 1924. On
June 23, 1925, the district court, again composed of three
judges, appointed, on motion of the Railroad, a special
master to take evidence. His report was filed on January
31, 1928. Soon thereafter, the defendants made the motion that the District Judge call two additional judges to
his assistance on final hearing. He was not required to do
this unless the suit was one in which, as provided in § 266,
it is sought to restrain "the enforcement, operation, or
execution of any statute of a State by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or
execution of such statute, or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or
commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of
such State . . . upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute." We are of opinion that Judge
Woodrough properly denied the motion.

EX PARTE WILLIAMS.
267

Opinion of the Court.

A case does not fall within § 266 unless' a statute or an
order of an administrative board or commission is challenged as contrary to the Federal Constitution. Oklahoma
Gas Co. v. Russell, 261 U. S. 290; Ex parte Buder, 271
U. S. 461, 465. Here, there was no question as to the
validity of the taxing statute. It was the assessment
which the Railroad challenged. And an assessment is not
an order made by an administrative board or commission,
within the meaning of that section. The function of
an assessing board is not that of issuing orders. Its function is informational. Its duty is to make findings of fact,
and thereby furnish the basis on which other officials are
to act in individual instances in levying and collecting
the taxes. An assessment does not command the taxpayer to do, or to refrain from doing any thing; does not
grant or withhold any privilege, authority, or license;
does not extend or abridge any power or facility; does
not determine any right or obligation. Compare Standard
Scale Co. v. Farrell,249 U. S. 571, 577; PennsylvaniaR. R.
Co. v. United States RailroadLabor Board, 261 U. S. 72;
United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. R. Co., 273
U. S. 299, 310; Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co.
v. Railroad Commission, 280 Fed. 901. An assessment is
directed by one officer of the State to another. Compare
Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, ante, p. 172.
Though in Nebraska the railroad property is, in the main,
assessed by a state board and the value of the part within
each county is then determined on a pro rata basis, the
function of assessing property within a county remains the
same as it would be if the valuation of all the property
were made by a county board. Whatever the scope of
the jurisdiction of the assessing body and whatever the
method of valuation pursued, the function to be performed
remains simply that of fact-finding.
For the purpose of jurisdiction in federal courts, the
difference between the function of regulating, expressed

272

Opinion of the Court.

277 U.S.

in orders of a railroad or like commission, and the function of fact-finding is vital. Determinations of an administrative board which are merely findings of fact are
not reviewable, Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., 261 U. S.
428. Assessments become reviewable judicially only whefi
they are translated into action, as by levy of the tax
based on the assessment. From this difference between
regulatory orders of administrative boards or commissions,
which constitute action, compare Prentisv. Atlantic Coast
Line Co., 211 U. S. 210, 226, and assessments by tax commissions or local assessors, which form merely a basis for
action, flows the difference in the method of review in
cases brought here under § 237 of the Judicial Code. A
judgment of a state court sustaining the validity of a
regulatory order of a public utilities board is reviewable
by writ of error, like a judgment sustaining the validity of
a statute. Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v.
Public Service Commission, 262 U. S. 679, 683; Northern
Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, 268 U. S
39, 42; Live Oak Water Users' Association v. Railroad
Commission, 269 U. S. 354, 356; Sultan Ry. & Timber Co.
v. Department of Labor & Industries, ante, p. 135. But
a judgment of a state court sustaining a tax alleged to be
illegal because there has been discrimination in assessing
property, can be reviewed only on certiorari. Jett Bros.
Distilling Co. v. City of Carrollton,252 U. S. 1, 5. This
is true whether it was the determination of a state or
local assessing body, or, as in the case at bar, of both
combined, which is alleged to have produced the discrimination. Baker v. Druesedow, 263 U. S. 137.
Obviously an assessment which is not "a statute of
or an authority exercised under any State" within the
meaning of § 237, before amended by the Act of 1925,
cannot be a statute or an order of an administrative board
or commission under § 266. The orders contemplated
by § 266 are directed to railroads or others, of whom action, or non-action, is commnanded, as it is by a statute.

EX PARTE WILLIAMS.
267

Opinion of the Court.

Compare Sultan Ry. & Timber Co. v. Department of
Labor and Industries, supra. Since an assessment by a
state board of equalization has none of the qualities that
would be associated with "orders," it cannot have been
the sort of state administrative function which Congress
had in mind when, by the amendment of 1913, it declared
the scope of § 266 so as to include suits in which the injunction was sought on the ground of the unconstitutionality of an administrative order.1
Under the Act of February 13, 1925, the final hearing
is not required to be before three judges unless the application for an interlocutory injunction was required to be.
In a large majority of the cases of this character in which
applications for an interlocutory' injunction have been
made, they have been heard before a single judge; and the
propriety of the practice has not been questioned by this
Court.' As we hold that the action of the state and
IThe purpose of the amendment, as stated by Mr. Clayton, who
had charge of the bill in the House, was "to put the order of a State
railroad commission upon an equality with a statute of a State; in
other words, to give the same force and effect to the order of a State
railroad commission as is accorded under existing law to a State
statute." 49 Cong. Rec. 4773.
2 This appears to have been the uniform practice where the assessment was made by local officials. Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Board
of Commissioners of Weld County, 217 Fed. 540, 247 U. S. 282;
Keokuk Bridge Co. v. Salm, 258 U. S. 122 (see original papers); Wilson v. Illinois Southern Ry. Co., 263 U. S. 574 (see original papers);
Callaway v. Bohler, 291 Fed. 243, 248; see 267 U. S. 479, 483'; Atchison, Topeka ,& Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Board of Commissioners of Douglas County, 225 Fed. 978; Gammil Lumber Co. v. Board of Supervisors of Rankin County, 274 Fed. 630. It has also been the practice
in the great majority of cases where the object of the suit was to
enjoin local officials from levying a tax based on an assessment made
by a state board and claimed to be discriminatory. Mudge v. McDougal, 222 Fed. 562; Nevada-CaliforniaPower Co. v. Hamilton, 235
Fed. 317; City Ry. Co. v. Beard, 283 Fed. 313; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Eveland, 285 Fed. 425, 437 (in this case the Tax
Commission was joined as defendant, but no relief appears to have
been sought against it); Ohio Fuel Supply Co. v. Paxton, 1 F. (2d)

county boards which is alleged to be discriminatory, is
not an order within the meaning of § 266, we have no
occasion to consider whether the lower court was right in
holding that the "county treasurers are not officers of the
State of Nebraska," or whether there are other reasons
why the suit is not within the scope of that section.

WILLING ET AL. v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM ASSOCIATION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 561.

Argued April 19, 20, 1928.-Decided May 21, 1928.

A corporation which had constructed and maintained a very expensive commercial building on ground leased to it for long terms, find662, 663; Fordson Coal Co. v. Maggard, 2 F. (2d) 708; Connecting
Gas Co. v. Imes, 11 F. (2d) 191, 195. On the other hand, in Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Osborne, 265 U. S. 14, the hearing
below was before three judges. In that case, as in this, the Tax Commissioner was joined as a defendant, but apparently no relief could
have been given against him. Where relief by injunction has been
sought against state tax commissions, boards of equalization, and
their members, the practice has been less uniform.. The application
for a temporary'injunction was entertained by a single judge in Johnson v. Wells, Fargo & Co., 205 Fed. 60, 239 U. S. 234 (prior to the
Act of 1913); Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Greene, 244 U. S.

Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Kendall, 278 Fed. 298,
