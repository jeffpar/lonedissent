OCTOBER TERM, .1927.
Argument for Petitioner.

277 U. S.

An American court of admiralty having jurisdiction of
a cause under the circumstances here involved, should
apply the American Maritime Law to the case as the lex
loci delicti.
In a suit in an American court, ยง 33 of the Jones Act
is applicable to a tort which occurs upon a foreign vessel
while lying in the territorial waters of the United States,
and applicable to this case.
The right given to seamen under ยง 33 of the Jones Act
to recover for personal injuries suffered in the course of
their employment as the result of negligence, may be enforced in admiralty by a proceeding in rem, in accordance
with the principles of the maritime law under which a
lien and right in rem is recognized in favor of seamen
suing for personal injuries. The Jones Act is not a local
statute of a State merely seized on by the courts as supplementary to the maritime law in absence of any similar
right afforded by that law. Cf. The Corsair, 145 U. S.
335; The Albert Dumois, 177 U. S. 240; The Hamilton,
207 U. S. 398; The J. E. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1. On the
contrary, it is a part of the general maritime law, enacted
by Congress, the legislative body empowered to .declare
and modify the maritime law, and concerns itself only
with seamen and their own and their employers' relative
rights--a subject peculiarly maritime-and is uniformly
applicable throughout the country wherever the American maritime law applies. PanamaR. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375.
The right of an injured seaman to a lien, or to proceed
against the vessel in rem to enforce such rights to indemnity as he had under the maritime law prior to the
enactment of the Jones Act, is well recognized. The
Lafayette, 269 Fed. 917.
The statute leaves the seaman free under the general
maritime law to enforce his right under the new rules by
proceeding in rem on the admiralty side of the court,

and permits the jurisdiction of the admiralty court to be
invoked and exercised through a proceeding -in rem, " as
it has been fromthe beginning" in cases involving personal injury to a -seaman in the course of his employment on a ship.. The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158; Inteinational Stevedore Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50; Sparling
v. United States, (The PrincessMatoika), 1925 A. M. C.
1547.
Under the general maritime law, independent of -the
Jones Act, libelant was entitled to recover for respondent's failure to: supply and keep in order, proper appliances, including a proper bos'n's chair and proper gantline, properly rigged, and for the unseaworthiness of the
vessel in this-respect.

rights are governed by British law, the

law of the ship's flag.
No maritime lien was created, and the rights of the
petitioner would be a suit either at law or in admiralty
against his employer. PanamW .ailroad Co. v. Johnson,
264 U. S. 375;, Western Fuel Co.v. Garcia,257 U. S. 233;
The Corsair,145 U. S. 335; The Albert Dumois, 177 U. S.
240; Benedict on Admiralty, 5th ed., Vol. 1, p. 215.,
Under the 'British law, petitioner had no lien against
the vessel which would support a libel in rem. Even if
American law.as laid down by this Court in The-Osceola,
189 U. S. 158, is applicable to this case, peitioner failed
to make out any'cause of action because the accident was
due to the negligen66of a fellow servant.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Plamals, the petitioner, a subject of Spain, belonged to
the crew of the British ship "Pinar Del Rio." She was

anchored at Philadelphia, April 27, 1923. He was being
hoisted up to paint the smoke stack; a rope broke; he
fell to the deck and sustained serious injuries. The accident resulted from the negligence of the mate who selected
a defective rope. An abundant supply of good rope was
on board.
Six months after the accident Plamals began this proceeding in rem against the ship in the District Court,
Southern District of New York. The libel alleged that
his injuries "were due to the fault or neglect of the said
steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope
was old, worn and not suitable for use, in that libellant
was ordered to perform services not within the scope of
his duties, and in other respects that libellant will point
out on the trial of this action."
There is nothing to show that painting the smoke stack
was beyond the scope of the duties assumed.
In the District Court the petitioner .asserted by his proctor that he claimed under Sec. 33, Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007,
which follows"That section 20 of such Act of March 4, 1915, be, and
is, amended to read as follows:
'See. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal
injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the
right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the
United States modifying or extending the common law
rigt or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any sea,
man as a result of any such personal injury the personal
representative of such seaman may maintain an action for
damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such
action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the ease of railway
employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the

PLAMALS v. PINAR DEL RIO.

Opinion of the Court.,

defendant employer resides or in which his principal office
is located.'"
The District Court ruled that the rights and liabilities
of the parties were fixed by the law of the ship's flag and
was of opinion that the British Workmen's Compensation Act afforded the only remedy. It accordingly dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that
a lien against the vessel is essential to every proceeding
in rem against her; and that no such lien arose by reason
of Sec. 33 of the Jones Act in favor of the injured seaman.
Upon that ground it affirmed the questioned decree.
We agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals
and find it unnecessary now to consider whether the provisions of Section 33 are applicable where a foreign seaman employed on a foreign ship suffers injuries while in
American waters.
The record does not support the suggestion that the
"Pinar Del Rio" was unseaworthy. The mate selected
a bad rope when good ones were available.
We must treat the proceeding as one to enforce the liability prescribed by Sec. 33. It was so treated by petitioner's proctor at the original trial; and the application
for certiorari here spoke of it as based upon that section.
The evidence would not support a recovery upon any
other ground.
Sec. 20, Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1185), originally
provided--" That in any suit to recover damages for any
injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen
having command shall not be held to be fellow-servants
with those under their authority." Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co. (1918), 247 U. S. 372,'384, pointed
out that this imposed no new liability upon the shipowner.
See. 33 brings into our maritime law the provisions of
certain statutes which define the liability of masters to
employees originally intended to be enforced in actions at

law. They imposed personal liability and gave no lien
of any kind. The statute which extended them to seamen
expressly provided that the employer might be sued only
in the district where he resides or has his principal office.
This provision repels the suggestion that the intention
was to subject the ship to in rem proceedings. Generally,
at least, proceedings of that nature may be brought
wherever the ship happens to be.
The ordinary maritime privilege or lien, though adhering to the vessel, is a secret one which may operate to the
prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without
notice and is therefore strictijuris. It cannot be extended
by construction, analogy or inference. The Corsair, 145
U. S. 335, 347; The Albert Dumois, 177 U. S. 240, 257;
Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 490, 499.
Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 386, 391,
declares--Sec. 33 "is concerned with the relative rights
and obligations of seamen and their employers arising out
of personal injuries sustained by the former in the course
of their employment." "The injured seaman is permitted
but not required to proceed on the common-law side of
the court." "The statute leaves the injured seaman free
under the general law-Secs. 24 (par. 3) and 256 (par. 3)
of the Judicial Code-to assert his right of action under
the new rules on the admiralty side of the court."
In the system from which these new rules come no hen
exists to secure claims arising under them and, of course,
no right to proceed in rem. We cannot conclude that the
mere incorporation into the maritime law of the rights
which they create to pursue the employer was enough to
give rise to a lien against the vessel upon which the injury
occurred. The section under consideration does not
undertake to impose liability on the ship itself, but by
positive words indicates a contrary purpose. Seamen may
invoke, at their election, the relief accorded by the old

ST. L. & S. W. RY. v. NATTIN.

rules against the ship, or that provided by the new against
the employer. But they may not have the benefit of both.
To subject vessels during all the time allowed by the
statute of limitations to secret liens to secure undisclosed
and unlimited claims for personal injuries by every seaman who may have suffered injury thereon would be a
very serious burden. One desiring to purchase, for example, could only guess vaguely concerning the value.
"An Act to provide for the promotion and maintenance of
the American Merchant Marine" ought not to be so construed in the absence of compelling language.
The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.
Affirmed.

No. 263.

Argued March 2,'1928.-Decided May 14, 1928.

1. A state statute empowering a local governing body, like the police
jury in Louisiana, to create road districts and with the approval of
a popular vote to construct roads aid issue bonds to pay for them,
to be met by taxation ad valorem of the land in the district, need
not allow the taxpayer a hearing on these matters (aside from the
valuation of his land for taxation), to be valid under the Fourteenth
Amendment. P. 159.
2. The Constitution of Louisiana did not inhibit the collection in
1926 of a tax partly intended to supply-funds to meet instalments
of principal and interest upon bonds maturing in March, 1927

3. The legality of a general ad valorem tax on the property in the
road district to pay for construction or improvement of roads, does
