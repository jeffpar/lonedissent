CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 403. Submitted April 9, 1928.-Decided May 21, 1928.
A suit to enjoin collection of a tax as violative of treaties between
the United States and the Chickasaw Indians and of certain Acts
of Congress, was dismissed by the state court upon the-ground that
there was a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy at law by paying
the tax under protest and suing for its recovery. Held that this
Court had no jurisdiction to review, as the judgment was put upon
an independent, non-federal ground, adequate to sustain it. P. 303.
Certiorari to 124 Okla. 256, dismissed.

of Oklahoma to enjoin the collection of a gross production
tax on his one-eighth royalty interest in the oil produced
under a lease of lands patented to him as his homestead
and surplus allotments from which all restrictions on
alienation and incumbrance had been removed-laiming
that this tax on his royalty share in the oil was in violation of the treaties between the United States and the
Chickasaw Indians and the Acts of Congress relating
thereto. The court dismissed the suit on motion, for
want of equity; and this was affirmed by the Supreme
Court of Oklahoma, without consideration of the federal
question, on the ground that under §§ 9971 and 9973 of
the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921, the petitioner
had a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy at law by
paying the tax under protest and suing for its recovery.
124 Okla. 256.
It is settled law that a judgment of a state court which
is put upon a non-federal ground, independent of the
federal question involved and broad enough to sustain
the judgment, cannot be reviewed by this Court, unless
the non-federal ground is so plainly unfounded that it
may be regarded as essentially arbitrary or a mere device
to prevent the review of a decision upon the federal question. Leathe v. Thomas, 207 U. S. 93, 99; Vandalia
Railroad v. South Bend, 207 U. S. 359, 367; Enterprise
Irrig.Dist.v. Canal Co., 243 U. S. 157, 164; Ward v. Love
County, 253 U. S. 17,22; and cases therein cited.
Here the non-federal ground upon which the Oklahoma
court based its decision-namely, that under the Oklahoma statutes the petitioner had a plain, adequate and
exclusive remedy at law-was based on its earlier decision in Black v. Geissler,58 Okla. 335. It is in harmony
with the decisions of this Court relating to similar
statutes of other States. Tennessee v., Sneed, 96 U. S.

v. HAGLUND,

SAME v. MOORE SHIPBUILDING COMPANY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 472, 473.

Submitted April 13, 1928.--ecided May 21, 1928.

While a steamship, without power or lookout, was being held "dead"
across a channel by a tug, leaving, however, ample space for navigation past her stem, a ferryboat, approaching the opening with
its view of the channel beyond obstructed by the steamer, blew a
single blast of her whistle, indicating her intention to pass in the
rear of the steamer, and having received an acceptance by a like
blast from the tug, continued at full speed until within the opening, when, perceiving another vessel approaching her, though not
dangerously near, she began prematurely her movement to pass
her and struck and injured the steamer. Held:
1. The collision was due solely to the negligence of the ferryboat.
P. 309.
2. The signal of the tug was merely its assent to the proposed
passing in the rear of the steamer. P. 310.
3. The tug was not at fault in accepting the passing signal and
in not sounding a warning instead, though aware of the approach
of the vessel on the other side, there being nothing in the situation
to indicate that the ferryboat would be thereby prevented from
passing the steamer safely, if navigated with due care. Id.
