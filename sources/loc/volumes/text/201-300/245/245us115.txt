HENDRICKSON v. CREAGER.
105.

Counsel for Parties.

of 1878 provided an exclusive remedy through application
to the Circuit Court in case the County Court should fail
in its duty, is not well founded. The decisions of the
Court of Appeals in Muhlenburg County v. Morehead,
20 Ky. Law Rep. 376, and Pennington v. WoQlfolk, 79
Kentucky, 13, make it quite plain that an "attempt to
impose on the Circuit Court or judge thereof the duty
of levying and collecting taxes is unconstitutional and
void" under the jurisprudence of Kentucky.
The judgment of the court below is
Affirmed.

KELLEY, TRUSTEE OF THE GIBRALTAR INVESTMENT AND HOME BUILDING COMPANY, BANKRUPT, v. GILL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 411.

Submitted October 2, 1917.-Decided November 5, 1917.

A court of bankruptcy has no jurisdiction over a suit in equity brought
by the trustee of a bankrupt corporation in the State of the corporation's domicile, against a number of its shareholders there residing,
for the purpose of collecting from, each an ascertained sum of money
which by the terms of such shareholder's individual subscription
contract had become unconditionally due and payable to the corporation at times specified and without regard to the obligations of
