OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

245 U. S.

FIDELITY & COLUMBIA TRUST COMPANY,
EXECUTOR AND TRUSTEE OF EWALD, v. CITY
OF LOUISVILLE.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.
No. 424.

Argued October 16, 17, 1917.-Decided November 5, 1917.

A person domiciled in Kentucky carried on a business in Missouri
and deposited in bank in the latter State moneys derived from the
business, but not used in it, and belonging absolutely to him. The
resulting credits-ordinary bank accounts not represented by certificates and subject to his order only-were included by Kentucky
authorities in assessing his taxes in that State. Held, that the tax,
whether considered as a tax on property or as a tax on the individual
measured by property, was within the power of the State imposing it.
A state court's decision does not deprive the complaining party of the
equal protection of the laws merely because it departs from decisions
made by the court in earlier cases.
168 Kentucky, 71; 171 Kentucky, 509; 172 Kentucky, 451, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

The amount and character of business done in St.
Louis, as compared with the amount and character of
business done in Louisville, were such as to make the
"business situs" of these deposits in Louisville rather
than in St. Louis.
Money on deposit must either arise out of business done
within the State with the residents thereof or be under the
control of a local agent, if it is to acquire a "business
situs." New Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309; Bristol
v. Washington County, 177 U. S. 133; Metropolitan Life

Cases involving taxes on franchises and on tangible
property are distinguishable from the case at bar. Adams
Express Co. v. Ohio, 166 U. S. 218; Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U. S. 397; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 202; Delaware,
L. & W. R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U. S. 357.
As to the contention that the deposits were permanent
deposits, it has never been held that the mere presence of
a deposit in a State gives that State a right to levy a
''property tax" upon it, no matter how long continued.

Sohmer, 233 U. S. 434.
This court has never held that intangible property, such
as is involved here, could not be taxed by the State of the
domicile of the owner, even though another State might
have imposed a tax. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491;
Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194;

Errol, 116 U. S. 517.
The fact that state decisions may be inconsistent raises
no federal question. Lombard v. Chicago Park Commissioners, 181 U. S. 33.
Kentucky decisions have been consistent throughout in
upholding taxes following the rule of intangible propeity.
The city is entitled to recover the amounts of the tax
bills herein, irrespective of the taxing situs of the money
in St. Louis. Section 2996, Kentucky Statutes; City of
Louisville v. CourierJournalCo., 140 Kentucky, 644; Bell's
Trustee v. City of Lexington, 120 Kentucky, 199; Security
Trust & S. V. Co. v. Lexington, 203 U. S. 323.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the City of Louisville, Kentucky, to recover annual taxes for the years 1907 and
1908 in respect of personal property omitted from the
original assessments to the owner L. P. Ewald in his lifetime. The facts as simplified for the purposes of argument
here are that Ewald was domiciled in Louisville but continued to carry on a business in St. Louis, Missouri, where
he formerly had lived. Deposits coming in part if not
wholly from this business were made and kept in St. Louis
banks subject to Ewald's order alone. They were not
used in the business and belonged absolutely to him.
The question is whether they could be taken into account
in determining the amount of his Louisville tax. It would
seem that some deposits were represented by certificates
of deposit but it was stated at the argument that no point
was made of that. See Wheeler v. Sohmer, 233 U. S. 434,
438. We are to take it that all the sums are to be dealt
with as ordinary bank accounts. The decision of the
state court upheld the tax. 168 Kentucky, 71. 171 Kentucky, 509. 172 Kentucky, 451.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

So far as the present decision is concerned we may concede without going into argument that the Missouri deposits could have been taxed in that State, under the
decisions of this court. Liverpool & London & Globe Ins.
Co. v. Orleans Assessors, 221 U. S. 346, 354. Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, 205 U. S. 395. But liability
to taxation in one State does not necessarily exclude liability in another. Kidd v. Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, 732.
Hawley v. Malden, 232 U. S. 1, 13. The present tax is a
tax upon the person, as is shown by the form of the suit,
and is imposed, it may be presumed, for the general advantages of living within the jurisdiction. These advantages, if the State so chooses, may be measured more or
less by reference to the riches of the person taxed. Unless
it is declared unlawful by authority we see nothing to
hinder the State from taking a man's credits into account.
But so far from being declared unlawful, it has been decided by this court that whether a State shall measure
the contribution by the value of such credits and choses
in action, not exempted by superior authority, is the
State's affair, not to be interfered with by the United
States, and therefore that a State may tax a man for a
debt due from a resident of another State. Kirtland v.
Hotchkiss, 100 U. S. 491. See also Tappan v. Merchants'
National Bank, 19 Wall. 490.
It is true that the decision in Kirtland v. Hotchkiss,
concerned Illinois bonds, and that if they were physically
present in the taxing State, Connecticut, a special principle might apply, as explained in Wheeler v. Sohmer,
233 U. S. 434, 438. See Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope,
[1891], A. C. 476, 481; Dicey, Confl. of Laws, 2d ed.,
312. But the decision was not made to turn upon such
considerations; indeed its reasoning hardly is reconcilable
with them or with anything short of a general rule for all
debts. It is argued that in a later case this court has held
the power of taxation not to extend to chattels perma-

Opinion of the Court.

nently situated outside the jurisdiction although the owner
was within it; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky,
199 U. S. 194; and that the power ought equally to be
denied as to debts depending for their validity and enforcement upon a jurisdiction other than that levying
the tax. But this court has not attempted to press the
principle so far and there is opposed to it the long established practise of considering the debts due to a man in
determining his wealth at his domicile for the purposes
of this sort of tax.
The notion that a man's personal property upon his
death may be regarded as a universitas and taxed as such,
even if qualified, still is recognized both here and in England. Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U. S. 625, 631. Eidman v.
Martinez, 184 U. S. 578, 586. Attorney-General v. Napier,
6 Exch. 217. It has been carried over in more or less
attenuated form to living persons, and the general principle laid down in Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, supra, has been
affirmed or assumed to be law in every subsequent case.
Bonaparte v. Appeal Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592. Pullman's
Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18, 29, 31.
Savings & Loan Society v. Multnomah County, 169 U. S.
421,431. New Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309, 321. Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors, 221
U. S. 346, 355, 356. It was admitted to apply to debts in
Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S.
194, 205. It is unnecessary to consider whether the distinction between a tax measured by certain property
and a tax on that property could be invoked in a case
like this. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 146,
162 et seq. Whichever this tax technically may be, the
authorities show that it must be sustained.
It is said that the plaintiff in error has been denied
the equal protection of the laws because, if the argument
is correct, which we have not considered, the decision in
this case is inconsistent with earlier decisions of the Ken-

tucky court. But with the consistency or inconsistency of
t1e Kentucky cases we have nothing to do. Lombard v.
West Chicago Parkc Commissioners, 181 U. S. 33, 44, 45.

We presume that like other appellate courts the Kentucky
Court of Appeals is free to depart from precedents if on
further reflection it thinks them wrong.
Judgment affirmed.

BUCHANAN v. WARLEY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.
No. 33. Argued April 10, 11, 1916; restored to docket for reargument
April 17, 1916; reargued April 27, 1917.-Decided November 5, 1917.
A city ordinance which forbids colored persons to occupy houses in
blocks where the greater number of houses are occupied by white
persons, in practical effect prevents the sale of lots in such blocks
to colored persons, and is unconstitutional. A white owner, who has
made an otherwise valid and enforceable contract to convey such
a lot to a colored person, for the erection of a house upon it for occupancy by the vendee, is deprived, in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment, of an essential element of his property,-the right to
dispose of it to a constitutionally qualified purebaser,-and may
attack the prohibition under the Fourteenth Amendment in a suit
for specific performance of the contract against the vendee.
A city ordinance forbidding colored persons from occupying houses as
residences, or places of abode or public assembly, on blocks where
the majority of the houses are occupied by white persons for those
purposes, and in like manner forbidding white persons when the
conditions as to occupancy are reversed, and which bases the interdiction upon color and nothing more, passes the legitimate bounds
of police power and invades the civil right to acquire, enjoy and use
