UNITED STATES v. SWEET.
562.

Syllabus.

In this view it follows that as our order of dismissal
rested upon the assumption that the removal was because
of diversity of citizenship only, the petition for rehearing
must be granted, the order of dismissal set aside, and the
cause restored to the docket.
So ordered.

UNITED STATES v. SWEET, ADMINISTRATOR
OF SWEET.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 99.

Argued December 19, 1917.-Decided January 28, 1918.

Section 6 of the Utah Enabling Act of July 16, 1894, c. 138, 28 Stat.
107, purports to grant to the State upon her admission sections 2,
16, 32 and 36 in every township, reserving lands embraced in permanent reservations, etc., but making no mention of mineral lands.
Section 10 provides that land granted by the act for educationalpurposes "shall not be subject to preemption, homestead entry, or
any other entry under the land laws of the United States, whether
surveyed or unsurveyed, but shall be surveyed for school purposes
only." Held, that the school section grant was not intended to
embrace land known to be valuable for coal.
It is the settled policy of Congress to dispose of mineral lands only
under laws specially including them. This is evinced by very
numerous enactments, beginning even with the Ordinance of May 20,
1785. It was expressed in its application to all grants, whether to a
State or not, by the particular acts whence came the general and

permanent provisions on the subject found in §§ 2318 and 2346 of
the Revised Statutes, and was even more firmly established by the
mining laws as a whole.

Taken collectively, the mining laws (including the coal land laws),
constitute a special code upon the subject of mineral lands, intended
not only to establish particular modes of disposing of such lands,

245 U. S.

but also to except and reserve them from all other grants and
modes of disposal where there is no express provision for their
inclusion.
The school land indemnity act of February 28, 1891, c. 384, 26 Stat.
796, in providing for lieu selections where sections 16 and 36 are
mineral, affords a plain implication that those sections are not to
pass under the grant if known to be mineral when the grant takes
effect.
The school land grant to Utah must be read in the light of the mining
laws (which have always applied in Utah), the school land indemnity
law, supra, and the settled policy of Congress respecting mineral
lands, and not as if it constituted the sole evidence of the legislative
will. As it contains no language certainly showing an intention to
depart from such policy, or explicitly or clearly withdrawing from
the operation of the mining laws the designated sections when
known to be mineral, its general terms cannot be held to include
them.
This conclusion is fortified by the fact that, although Utah was known
to be rich in minerals as well as salines, the Enabling Act in its
extensive grants is silent as to minerals but includes an express
grant of salines; also by the committee reports in Congress, uniform
construction by the Land Department, and the Act of May 3, 1902,
c. 683, 32 Stat. 188, declaring that as to Utah the school land indemnity law of February 28, 1891, supra, shall apply to sections 2
and 32 as well as 16 and 36.
Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, distinguished and some of its observations disapproved.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful for the United
States.
Mr. A. C. Ellis, Jr., with whom Mr. W. H. Dickson was
on the brief, for appellee:
Section 6 of the Utah Enabling Act must be taken ac-

'cording to the plain meaning of its words.

There is no
exception or even mention in it of mineral lands; but
other matters excepted are enumerated with particularity

Argument for Appellee.

which shows the more clearly that no exception of mineral
land could have been intended. The same is true of the
entire statute, which does not mention mines or minerals,
much less except them. Section 10 furthermore declares
that these school sections were under no circumstances to
be subject to entry "under the land laws" of the United
States-the mineral laws, necessarily, as well as the nonmineral.
The Utah Constitution, Art. X, undertook to provide
for the sale of "minerals" from "school lands." This
was a construction of § 4 of the Enabling Act as granting
mineral lands, and this construction was acquiesced in by
the general Government through the President when he
accepted and proclaimed the constitution as in accordance
with the act.
The grant being absolute on its face and perfectly clear
and unequivocal, the courts cannot engraft upon it an
exception. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film
Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502, 510; Carey v. Donohue, 240 U. S.
430; United States v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 213 Fed.
Rep. 169, 173; Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U. S. 567, 579, 580;
Sutherland, Stat. Constr., § 328.
The policy of the Government is to be found in its
statutes, its court decisions and the constant practice of
its officials. The policy from the beginning has been to
deal bounteously with the common schools, definitely to
grant the school sections. Exceptions should not be allowed unless the statute itself contains them. Cooper v.
Roberts, 18 How. 173, 177; s. c., 20 How. 467, 484, 485;
Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517. There has been no uniform policy to except mineral land from such grants.
Some enabling acts do and some do not. The Oklahoma
Act expressly recognizes that minerals may pass to the
State (34 Stat. 273), and this immediately preceded the
Utah Act. Besides, the act being plain, the courts cannot
vary it to suit their ideas of policy-the intention must

be gathered from the words. [Citing many cases.] Section 2318, Rev. Stats., applies only where the disposition
of mineral land is not "otherwise directed by law," which
is not this case. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373,
391; Hamilton v. Rathbone, 175 U. S. 414, 421. Besides,
the Enabling Act repeals all acts and parts of acts in conflict with it.
Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., 102 U. S. 167;
Deffcback v. Hawke, 115 U. S. 392; and Heydenfeldt v.
Dancy Gold & Silver Mining Co., 93 U. S. 634, are readily
distinguishable.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a suit by the United States to quiet the title to
section 32 of a designated township in Carbon County,
Utah, the suit being specially directed against a claim asserted by the defendant, as an assignee of the State, under
the school land grant to the latter. Whether this tract
passed to the State under that grant or was reserved to
the United States as mineral land is the matter in controversy. In the District Court the United States prevailed as to all but 40 acres, but in the Circuit Court of
Appeals that decree was reversed and one for the defendant was directed. 228 Fed. Rep. 421.
The evidence shows that the entire section, excepting
40 acres, is valuable for coal and has been known to be so
since before Utah became a State. Land valuable for coal
is mineral land within the meaning of the public land laws.
Thus the ultimate question for decision is whether the
school land grant to Utah embraces mineral land. The
grant is found in § 6 of the Act of Congress of July 16,
1894, c. 138, 28 Stat. 107, and is copied in the margin I

tions numbered two, sixteen, thirty-two, and thirty-six in every town-

with another closely related section of the same act. It
neither expressly includes mineral lands nor expressly excludes them. If it did either, it would be conclusive of
the will of Congress upon the point. But, as it makes no
mention of such lands, it is permissible-indeed, is essential-to inquire whether the congressional will is otherwise made manifest, that is to say, whether the general
words of the grant are to be read in the light of other statutes and a settled public policy in respect of mineral lands.
In the legislation concerning the public lands it has been
the practice of Congress to make a distinction between
mineral lands and other lands, to deal with them along
different lines, and to withhold mineral lands from disposal save under laws specially including them. This
practice began with the ordinance of May 20, 1785, 10
Journals of Congress, Folwell's ed., 118, and was observed
ship of said proposed State, and where such sections or any parts thereof
have been sold or otherwise disposed of by or under the authority of
any Act of Congress other lands equivalent thereto, in legal subdivisions of not less than one quarter section and as contiguous as may
be to the section in lieu of which the same is taken, are hereby granted
to said State for the support of common schools, such indemnity lands
to be selected within said State in such manner as the legislature may
provide, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided,
That the second, sixteenth, thirty-second, and thirty-sixth sections
embraced in permanent reservations for national purposes shall not,
at any time, be subject to the grants nor to the indemnity provisions
of this Act, nor shall any lands embraced in Indian, military, or other
reservations of any character be subject to the grants or to the indemnity provisions of this Act until the reservation shall have been extinguished and such lands be restored to and become a part of the pub-

lic domain.
Sec. 10. That the proceeds of lands herein granted for educational
purposes, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, shall constitute a
permanent school fund, the interest of which only shall be expended
for the support of said schools, and such land shall not be subject to
prefmption, homestead entry, or any other entry under the land laws
of the United States, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, but shall be
surveyed for school purposes only,

with such persistency in the early land laws I as to lead
this court to say in United States v. Gratiot, 14 Pet. 526,
"It has been the policy of the government, at all times in
disposing of the public lands, to reserve the mines for the
use of the United States," and also to hold in United States
v. Gear, 3 How. 120, that an act making no mention of
lead-mine lands and providing generally for the sale of
"all the lands" in certain new land districts, "reserving
only" designated tracts, "any law of Congress heretofore
existing to the contrary notwithstanding," could not be
regarded as disclosing a purpose on the part of Congress
to depart from "the policy which had governed its legislation in respect to lead-mine lands," and so did not embrace them. A like practice prevailed in respect of saline
lands, and in Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall. 660, where a
disposal of such lands under an act providing generally
for the sale of lands in certain Territories was drawn in
question, this court said that it could not be supposed
"without an express declaration to that effect" that Congress intended by such an act to permit the sale of saline
lands and thus to depart from "a long-established policy
by which it had been governed in similar cases."
While the early land laws occasionally and specially
provided for the sale of mineral lands, they very generally
evinced a purpose to reserve such lands for future disposal;
and this purpose was given particular emphasis following
the discovery of gold in California in 1848, as is shown
in the Oregon donation act, the homestead act (which

adopted the mineral land reservation of the preemption
act of 1841), the grant to the several States for the benefit of agricultural colleges, the railroad land grants and
other land acts of that period.' Noticeable among those
acts is one which, in dealing with grants to Nevada and
surveys in that State, declared, "in all cases lands valuable for mines of gold, silver, quicksilver, or copper shall
be reserved from sale," c. 166, 14 Stat. 85, and another
declaring, "no act passed at the first session of the thirtyeighth congress, granting lands to states or corporations,
to aid in the construction of roads or for other purposes,
or to extend the time of grants heretofore made, shall be
so construed as to embrace mineral lands, which in all
cases shall be, and are, reserved exclusively to the United
States, unless otherwise specially provided in the act or
acts making the grant." 13 Stat. 567. Although applied
in one instance to lands in Nevada and in the other to
grants made at a particular session of Congress, these declarations were but expressive of the will of Congress that
every grant of public lands, whether to a State or otherwise, should be taken as reserving and excluding mineral
lands in the absence of an expressed purpose to include
them; and upon this theory both declarations were carried into the Revised Statutes as being general and per1 Acts

manent in their nature--the first in enlarged terms as
§ 2318,1 and the other as § 2346.
By the Act of March 3, 1853, c. 145, 10 Stat. 244, Congress granted to the State of California sections 16 and
36 in each township for school purposes and large quantities of lands for other purposes. Mineral lands were
neither expressly excepted from nor expressly included in
the grant of the school sections, but were specially excepted
from the other grants. This difference led to a controversy over the true meaning of the school grant, the state
authorities taking the view that it did, and the land officers of the United States that it did not, include mineral
lands. Ultimately the controversy came before this court
in Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., 102 U. S. 167,
and the position taken by the land officers of the United
States was sustained, the court saying, p. 174:
"Taking into consideration what is well known to have
been the hesitation and difficulty in the minds of Congressmen in dealing with these mineral lands, the manner
in which the question was suddenly forced upon them,
the uniform reservation of them from survey, from sale,
from preemption, and above all from grants, whether for
railroads, public buildings, or other purposes, and looking to the fact that from all the grants made in this act
they are reserved, one of which is for school purposes besides the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections, we are forced
to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to depart
from its uniform policy in this respect in the grant of
those sections to the State.
"It follows from the finding of the court and the undisputed facts of the case, that the land in controversy being
mineral land, and well known to be so when the surveys of
it were made, did not pass to the State under the schoolsection grant."
I Sec. 2318. In all cases lands valuable for minerals shall be reserved
from sale, except as otherwise expressly directed by law.

UNITED STATES v. SWEET.
563.

Opinion of the Court.

That ruling was reaffirmed and followed in Mullan v.
United States, 118 U. S. 271, where valuable coal lands,
known to be such, were held not to be open to selection
by the State as indemnity school lands.
The conditions ensuing from the discovery of gold and
other minerals in the western States and Territories resulted in a general demand for a system of laws expressly
opening the mineral lands to exploration, occupation and
acquisition, and Congress, responding to this demand,
adopted from 1864 to 1873 a series of acts dealing with
practically every phase of the subject and covering all
classes of mineral lands, including coal lands.' These
acts, with some before noticed, were carried into a chapter
of the Revised Statutes entitled "Minerals Lands and
Mining Resources." Taken collectively they constitute a
special code upon that subject and show that they are intended not only to establish a particular mode of disposing of mineral lands, but also to except and reserve them
from all other grants and modes of disposal where there
is no express provision for their inclusion. Thus the policy of disposing of mineral lands only under laws specially
including them became even more firmly established than
before, and this is recognized in our decisions. Mining
Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., supra, 174; Deffeback v.
Hawke, 115 U. S. 392, 402; Davis v. Weibbold, 139 U. S.
507, 516. And while the mineral-land laws are not applicable to all the public land States, some being specially
excepted, 2 there has been no time since their enactment
when they were not applicable to Utah.

245 U. S.

Another statute indicative of the policy of Congress
and pertinent to the present inquiry is the Act of February
28, 1891, c. 384, 26 Stat. 796, which defines the indemnity
to which a State or Territory is entitled in respect of its
school grant. In addition to dealing with deficiencies occurring in other ways, it provides, "And other lands of
equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted,
and may be selected by said State or Territory where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land." In this there
is a plain implication that where those sections are mineral-known to be so when the grant takes effect-they
do not pass under the grant. And it does not militate
against this implication that under another provision the
State may surrender those sections and take other lands
in lieu of them where, although not known to be mineral
when the grant takes effect, they are afterwards discovered to be so. See California v. Deseret Water &c. Co.,
243 U. S.415.
What has been said demonstrates that the school grant
to Utah must be read in the light of the mining laws, the
school land indemnity law and the settled public policy
respecting mineral lands, and not as though it constituted
the sole evidence of the legislative will. United States v.
Barnes, 222 U. S. 513, 520. When it is so read it does not,
in our opinion, disclose a purpose to include mineral lands.
Although couched in general terms adequate to embrace
such lands if there were no 'statute or settled policy to
the contrary, it contains no language which explicitly or
clearly withdraws the designated sections, where known
to be mineral in character, from the operation of the mining laws, or which certainly shows that Congress intended
to depart from its long prevailing policy of disposing of
mineral lands only under laws specially including them.
1883, c. 118, 22 Stat. 487; March 3, 1891, c. 543, 26 Stat. 1026; June
6, 1900, c. 813, 31 Stat. 680.

UNITED STATES v. SWEET.
563.

Opinion of the Court.

It therefore must be taken as neither curtailing those
laws nor departing from that policy.
This conclusion is fortified by other considerations.
When the grant was made Utah was known to be rich in
minerals and salines. Besides this grant the act contains
others aggregating 1,570,080 acres. In none is there any
mention of mineral lands. As to 110,000 acres there is
an express inclusion of saline lands. This silence as to
mineral lands, when contrasted with the special inclusion of saline lands, indicates that the former are not included. See Montello Salt Co. v. Utah, 221 U. S. 452, 466.
The committees of Congress, upon whose recommendation the act was passed, construed it as not embracing
mineral lands, for in their reports 1they stated that "All
mineral lands are exempt from any grant made under the
act." The Land Department has uniformly placed the
same construction upon it.2 And Congress acted upon
that construction when, by the Act of May 3, 1902, c. 683,
32 Stat. 188, it declared that as to the State of Utah "all
the provisions" of the school land indemnity law of February 28, 1891, before noticed, should apply to sections
2 and 32 as well as to sections 16 and 36,-the grant to
that State covering all of these sections instead of the latter two as in other western States.
The case of Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, is relied upon
as making for a different conclusion. Part of a school section in Michigan known to be mineral was there in controversy and was held to have passed to the State under
its school grant. At the time the section was surveyed,
which was the date when the grant was to take effect,
there was a statute which in a single section provided for

the sale of mineral lands, and also of other lands, and concluded with a reservation of the school sections "from
such sales." The real question was whether those sections were reserved from both classes of sales, and this the
court answered in the affirmative. Some observations in
the opinion are not in accord with our present conclusion.
These were relied upon in Mining Co. v. Consolidated
Mining Co., supra, as our records show, and were in effect
disapproved. Besides, when they were made the public
policy respecting mineral lands had not been expressed in
general and permanent laws, such as were afterwards enacted and carried into the Revised Statutes. See Lindley
on Mines, 3d ed., § 136. The case, therefore, is neither
controlling nor persuasive here.
It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.
It is so ordered.
