therefore, was entitled in this suit to assert and show, if
such was the fact, that the tract was valuable for placer
mining, as originally found by the land officers; and had
he shown that this was its real character, he would have
been entitled to a decree charging the title with an appropriate trust for his benefit. Guaranty Savings Bank v.
Bladow, 176 U. S. 448, 453, 454; Thayer v. Spratt, supra.
But no such showing was made at the trial. On the contrary, the evidence established that the tract was strictly
agricultural, and therefore not subject to entry or acquisition under the placer mining law. Thus it appears
that the irregularity complained of was not prejudicial
and did not result in the issue of a patent to one when it
should have gone to another. See Bohall v. Dilla, 114 U.

In order that the declarations and conduct of third parties may be
admissible against persons sued with respect to acts done to carry
out an alleged conspiracy, a combination between them and the
defendants must be shown by independent evidence; but the criminal or otherwise unlawful character of the combination may be
shown by the declarations themselves.
The same liberty which enables men to form unions, and through the
unions to enter into agreements with employers willing to agree, entitles other men to remain independent of the union and other employers to agree with them to employ no man who owes any allegiance
or obligation to the union. In the latter case as in the former the
parties are entitled to be protected by the law in the enjoyment of
the benefits of any lawful agreement they may make.
The right of action for persuading an employee to leave his employer,
universally recognized, rests upon fundamental principles of general
application.
The right of workingmen to form unions and to enlarge their membership by inviting other workingmen to join is conceded, provided the
objects of the union be proper and legitimate.
The right of workingmen to enlarge the membership of unions by inviting other workingmen to join, like other civil rights, must be
exercised with reasonable regard for the conflicting rights of others;
and the members of a union having notice that the employees of an
establishment are under contract with their employer not to remain
in his employ after joining the union, may not lawfully, for the purpose of unionizing the establishment through an actual or threatened
strike, induce or seek to induce such employees to violate their contract by joining the union, or (what in equity is the same) by secretly
agreeing to join, and thereafter remaining at work until sufficient
new members can be obtained so as to bring about a strike, thus
uniting with the union in a plan to subvert the system of employment to which they voluntarily have agreed and upon which their
employer and their fellow-employees are relying.
An employer is entitled to the good-will of his employees, irrespective
of the fact that they are employed at will and that the relation is
terminable by either party at any time; he is entitled to the benefit
of the reasonable probability that by properly treating them he will
be able to retain them in his employ and to fill vacancies occurring
from time to time by the employment of other men on the same
terms. It is unlawful for a third party, having notice of this relation,
to interfere with it without just cause or excuse.

events to damage and which does in fact damage another person in
his property or trade, is malicious in law and actionable if done without just cause or excuse.
A proffered excuse can not be deemed a just cause or excuse where it
is based upon an assertion of conflicting rights that are sought to be
attained by unfair methods and for the very purpose of interfering
with plaintiff's rights of which defendants have notice.
Any violation of plaintiff's legal rights, contrived by defendants for the
purpose of inflicting damage, or having that as its necessary effectfor example, a combination to procure concerted breaches of contract by plaintiff's employees-is as plainly unlawful as if it involved
a breach of the peace.
The purpose entertained by defendants to bring about a strike at plaintiff's mine in order to compel plaintiff, through fear of financial loss,
to consent to the unionization of the mine as the lesser evil, was an
unlawful purpose; and the methods resorted to by defendants-the
inducing of employees to unite with the union in an effort to subvert
the system of employment at the mine by concerted breaches of the
contracts of employment known to be in force there-were unlawful
and malicious methods, not to be justified as a fair exercise of the
right to increase the membership of the union.
Convinced by costly strikes of the futility of attempting to operate under a closed-shop agreement with a certain union, plaintiff established its mine on a non-union basis, with the unanimous approval
of its employees and under a mutual agreement, assented to by them
all, that plaintiff would continue to run its mine non-union and not
recognize the union; that if any man wanted to become a member of
the union he was at liberty to do so, but he could not be a member
and remain in plaintiff's employ. Under that agreement plaintiff
ran its mine for a year and more, and, so far as appears, without the
slightest disagreement between it and its men, and without any
grievance on their part. Thereupon, defendants, having full notice
of the agreement, and acting without any agency for the men, but
as representatives of an organization of mine workers in other
States, and in order to subject plaintiff to such participation by the
union in the management of the mine as necessarily results from the
making of a closed-shop agreement, sent their agent to the mine,
who, with full notice of, and for the very purpose of subverting, the
status arising from plaintiff's agreement and subjecting the mine to
the union control, proceeded, without physical violence, indeed, but
by persuasion accompanied with threats of a reduction of wages and
deceptive statements as to the attitude of the mine management,

to induce plaintiff's employees to join the union and at the same time
to break their agreement with plaintiff by remaining in its employ

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit in equity, commenced October 24, 1907,
in the United States Circuit (afterwards District) Court
for the Northern District of West Virginia, by the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of West Virginia, against
certain citizens of the State of Ohio, sued individually
and also as officers of the United Mine Workers of America. Other non-citizens of plaintiff's State were named
as defendants but not served with process. Those who
were served and who answered the bill were T. L. Lewis,
Vice President of the U. M. W. A. and of the International
Union U. M. W. A.; William Green, D. H. Sullivan, and
"George" W. Savage, (his correct Christian name is
Gwilym), respectively President, Vice President, and

of Sub-district No. 5 of District No. 6.

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL. 233
229.

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff owns about 5,000 acres of coal lands situate
at or near Benwood, in Marshall County, West Virginia,
and within what is known as the "Pan Handle District"
of that State, and operates a coal mine thereon, employing
between 200 and 300 men, and having an annual output,
in and before 1907, of about 300,000 tons. At the time
of the filing of the bill, and for a considerable time before
and ever since, it operated its mine "non-union," under
an agreement with its men to the effect that the mine
should be run on a non-union basis, that the employees
should not become connected with the Union while employed by plaintiff, and that if they joined it their employment with plaintiff should cease. The bill set forth
these facts, inter alia, alleged that they were known to
defendants and each of them, and "that the said defendants have unlawfully and maliciously agreed together,
confederated, combined and formed themselves into a
conspiracy, the purpose of which they are proceeding
to carry out and are now about to finally accomplish,
namely: to cause your orator's mine to be shut down,
its plant to remain idle, its contracts to be broken and
unfulfilled, until such time as your orator shall submit
to the demand of the Union that it shall unionize its
plant, and having submitted to such demand unionize
its plant by employing only union men who shall become
subject to the orders of the Union," etc. The general
object of the bill was to obtain an injunction to restrain
defendants from interfering with the relations existing
between plaintiff and its employees in order to compel
plaintiff to "unionize" the mine.
A restraining order having been granted, followed by a
temporary injunction, the served defendants filed answers,
and thereupon made a motion to modify the injunction,
which was refused. 172 Fed. Rep. 963. An appeal taken
by defendants from this order was dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 176 Fed. Rep. 549. Afterwards

they applied for and obtained leave to withdraw their
answers and file others; the order, however, prescribed
that the withdrawn answers were "not to be removed
from the file." The new answers denied all material
averments of the bill, some of which had been admitted
in the former answers. Plaintiff, having filed replications,
obtained an order that the former answers should be
treated as evidence on behalf of the plaintiff upon the
issue joined. Upon this evidence and other evidence
introduced before the court orally, the case was submitted,
with the result that a final decree was made January 18,
1913, granting a perpetual injunction. 202 Fed. Rep. 512.
This was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals June 1,
1914 (214 Fed. Rep. 685), but the mandate was stayed
pending an application to this court for a writ of certiorari.
Afterwards an appeal was allowed. This court dismissed
the appeal, but granted the writ of certiorari (241 U. S.
644), the record on appeal to stand as a return.
The final decree of the District Court included an
award of injunction against John Mitchell, W. B. Wilson,
and Thomas Hughes, who while named as defendants in
the bill were not served with process and entered no appearance except to object to the jurisdiction of the court
over them. Under the federal practice, the appearance
to object did not bind these parties to submit to the jurisdiction on the overruling of the objection (Harkness v.
Hyde, 98 U. S. 476, 479; Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton,
146 U. S. 202, 206; Mexican Central Ry. Co. v. Pinkney,
149 U. S. 194, 209; Goldey v. Morning News, 156 U. S.
518; Davis v. C., C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 217 U. S. 157, 174),
and since the injunction operates only in personam, it
was erroneous to include them as defendants. It also
was erroneous to include personal relief by injunction
against certain named parties who, pending suit, were
chosen to succeed some of the original defendants as
officers of the international, district, and sub-district

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.

Opinion of the Court.

unions, but who were not served with process and did not
appear, they being included upon the ground that they
were "before the court by representation through service
having been had upon their said predecessors in office."
This suit was commenced, and was carried to final decree
in the trial court, before the taking effect of the present
Equity Rules (226 U. S. 629), and hence is governed by
the former Rule 48 (210 U. S. 524), under which the
rights of absent parties were expressly reserved.
But these procedural difficulties do not affect that part
of the decree which awarded an injunction against the
answering defendants (Lewis, Green, Sullivan, Savage,
Watkins, Zelenka, and Rankin) "individually" and not
as officers of the Union or its branches except as to Savage,
against whom the decree goes in both his individual and
official capacities, he alone having retained at the time of
the final decree the same office he held at the beginning
of the suit. If there was error in excluding the "official"
responsibility of the others, it was not one of which they
could complain, and it was not assigned for error upon
their appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. If they were
subject to injunction at all, they were so in their individual
capacities. Whether the decree will bind their successors in office, or their fellow-members of the Union, is
a question to be determined hereafter, if and when proceedings are taken to enforce the injunction against
parties other than the answering defendants.
We proceed, therefore, to consider the case as it stands
against the answering defendants.
The District Court based its decision upon two grounds:
(1) That the organization known as the United Mine
Workers of America, and its branches, as conducted and
managed at the time of the suit and for many years before, was a common-law conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade, and also and especially a conspiracy
against the rights of non-union miners in West Virginia;

and (2)
plaintiff
relating
of coal,

245 U. S.

That the defendants, in an effort to compel the
to enter into contractual relations with the Union
to the employment of labor and the production
although having knowledge of express contracts

existing between plaintiff and its employees which excluded relations with the Union, endeavored by unlawful
means to procure a breach of these contracts by the

employees.
A brief recital of previous transactions between the
parties becomes material. The Union is a voluntary and
unincorporated association which was organized in the
year 1890 in the States of Ohio and Indiana, and afterwards was extended to other States. It is made up of
national or "international," district, sub-district, and
local unions. District No. 6 comprises the coal districts
of Ohio and the Panhandle of West Virginia. Sub-district
No. 5 of that district comprises five counties and parts
of counties in Ohio, and the Panhandle.
The answering defendants were and are active and
influential members-leaders-of the Union, as well as
officers. Savage, Lewis, and Sullivan have been members
from its formation in 1890, and have held important offices
in it and attended the national conventions. The others
are long-time members, and possessed an influence indicated by the offices they held, but not limited to the
duties of those offices.
From 1897 to 1906 what were known as joint interstate conferences were held annually or biennially between
officials of the Union and representatives of the operators
in the "Central Competitive Field" (which includes
Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, but
not West Virginia), for the purpose of agreeing upon
the scale of wages and the conditions of employment
in that field. In addition there were occasional conferences of the same character affecting other States

and districts.

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

237

Opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff's mine is within the territorial limits of Subdistrict No. 5 of District No. 6. Coal-mining operations
were commenced there in the early part of the year 1902,
and the mine was operated "non-union" until April,
1903, when, under threats from the Union officials, including defendants Watkins and Sullivan, that a certain
unionized mine in Ohio, owned by the same proprietors,
would be closed down if the men at the Hitchman were
not allowed to organize, plaintiff consented to the unionization of the latter mine. This went into effect on the
1st. of April, 1903, and upon the very next day the men
were called out on strike because of a disagreement with
the company as to the basis upon which mining" should
be paid for. The strike continued until May 23, requiring plaintiff to cease operations and preventing it from
fulfilling its contracts, the most important of which
was one for the daily supply of engine coal to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at a coaling station adjoining
the mine. The financial loss to plaintiff was serious.
The strike was settled and the men resumed work upon
the basis of a modification of the official mining scale
applicable to the Hitchman mine.
Again, in the spring of 1904, there was difficulty in,
renewing the scale. A temporary scale, agreed upon
between operators and miners for the month of April,
1904, was signed in behalf of the Hitchman Company
on the 18th of April. Two days later the men at the
Hitchman struck, and the mine remained idle for two
months, during which time plaintiff sustained serious
losses in business and was put to heavy expense in obtaining coal from other sources to fill its contract with
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. The strike
was settled by the adoption of the official scale for the
Panhandle District, with amendatory local rules for the
Hitchman mine.
After this there was little further trouble until April 1,

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.

245 U. S.

1906, when a disagreement arose between the Union and
an association of operators with which plaintiff was not
connected-the association being in fact made up of its
competitors-about arranging the terms of the scale
for the ensuing two years. At the same time a similar
disagreement arose between the operators and the Union
officials in the Central Competitive Field. The result
was a termination of the interstate conferences and a
failure to establish any official scale for the ensuing two
years, followed by a widespread strike, or a number of
concurrent strikes, involving the most of the bituminous
coal-producing districts. There was absolutely no grievance or ground of disagreement at the Hitchman mine,
beyond the fact that the mining scale expired by its own
terms on March 31, and the men had not received authority from the Union officials either to renew it or to
agree to a new one in its place. Plaintiff came to an
understanding with the local union to the effect that if
its men would continue at work the company would pay
them from April 1st whatever the new scale might be,
except that if the new scale should prove to be lower than
that which expired on March 31, there should be no reduction in wages, while if the scale was raised the company would pay the increased amount, dating it back
to April 1st. This was satisfactory to the men; but as
the question of a new scale was then under discussion at
a conference between the officials of the Union and the
representatives of the Operators' Association, and plaintiff's employees wished to get the sanction of their officers,
the manager of the Hitchman mine got into communication with those officials, including defendant Green,
President of District No. 6, and endeavored to secure
their assent to the temporary arrangement, but without
success. Then a committee of the local union, including
Daugherty, its President, took up the matter with Green
and received permission to mine and load engine coal

239

Opinion of the Court.

until further notice from him. Under this arrangement
the men remained at work for about two weeks. On
April 15th, defendant Zelenka, Vice President of the subdistrict, visited the mine, called a meeting of the miners,
and addressed them in a foreign tongue, as a result of
which they went on strike the next day, and the mine
was shut down until the 12th of June, when it resumed
as a "non-union " mine, so far as relations with the U. M.
W. A. were concerned.
During this strike plaintiff was subjected to heavy
losses and extraordinary expenses with respect to its
business, of the same kind that had befallen it during
the previous strikes.
About the 1st of June a self-appointed committee of
employees called upon plaintiff's president, stated in
substance that they could not remain longer on strike
because they were not receiving benefits from the Union,
and asked upon what terms they could return to work.
They were told that they could come back, but not as
members of the United Mine Workers of America; that
thenceforward the mine would be run non-union, and the
company would deal with each man individually. They
assented to this, and returned to work on a non-union
basis. Mr. Pickett, the mine superintendent, had charge
of employing the men, then and afterwards, and to each
one who applied for employment he explained the conditions, which were that while the company paid the wages
demanded by the Union and as much as anybody else,
the mine was run non-union and would continue so to
run; that the company would not recognize the United
Mine Workers of America; that if any man wanted to
become a member of that union he was at liberty to do so;
but he could not be a member of it and remain in the
employ of the Hitchman Company; that if he worked
for the company he would have to work as a non-union
man. To this each man employed gave his assent, un-

245 U. S.

derstanding that while he worked for the company he
must keep out of the Union.
Since January, 1908 (after the commencement of the
suit), in addition to having this verbal understanding,
each man has been required to sign an employment
card expressing in substance the same terms. This
has neither enlarged nor diminished plaintiff's rights,
the agreement not being such as is required by law to be
in writing.
Under this arrangement as to the terms of employment,
plaintiff operated its mine from June 12, 1906, until the
commencement of the suit in the fall of the following
year.
During the same period a precisely similar method of
employment obtained at the Glendale mine, a property
consisting of about 1,200 acres of coal land adjoining
the Hitchman property on the south, and operated by a
company having the same stockholders and the same
management as the Hitchman; the office of the Glendale
mine being at the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company's
office. Another mine in the Panhandle, known as the
Richland, a few miles north of the L-itchman, likewise
was run ((non-union."
In fact, all coal mines in the Panhandle and elsewhere
in West Virginia, except in a small district known as the
Kanawha field, were run "non-union," while the entire
industry in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois was operated on
the "closed-shop" basis, so that no man could hold a
job about the mines unless he was a member of the United
Mine Workers of America. Pennsylvania occupied a
middle ground, only a part of it being under the jurisdiction of the Union. Other States need not be particularly mentioned.
The unorganized condition of the mines in the Panhandle and some other districts was recognized as a serious interference with the purposes of the Union in the

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

241

Opinion of the Court.

Central Competitive Field, particularly as it tended to
keep the cost of production low, and, through competition with coal produced in the organized field, rendered
it more difficult for the operators there to maintain
prices high enough to induce them to grant certain concessions demanded by the Union. This was the subject
of earnest and protracted discussion in the annual international convention of the U. M. W. A. held at Indianapolis, Indiana, in the month of January, 1907, at which
all of the answering defendants were present as delegates
and participated in the proceedings. The discussion
was based upon statements contained in the annual
reports of John Mitchell, as President of the Union
(joined as a defendant in the bill but not served with
process), and of defendant Lewis, as Vice President, respecting the causes and consequences of the strike of
1906, and the policy to be adopted by the Union for the
future. In these reports it was made to appear that the
strike had been caused immediately by the failure of the
joint convention of operators and miners representing
the central and southwestern competitive fields, held in the
early part of the year 1906, to come to an agreement
for a renewal of the mining scale; that the strike was
widespread, involving not less than 400,000 mine workers, was terminated by "district settlements," with
variant results in different parts of the territory involved,
and had not been followed by a renewal of the former relations between the operators and miners in the Central
Competitive Field. Another result of the strike was a
large decrease in the membership of the Union. Two
measures of relief were proposed: first, that steps be taken
to reestablish the joint interstate conferences; and second,
the organization of the hitherto unorganized fields, including the Panhandle District of West Virginia, under
closed-shop agreements, with all men about the mines
included in the membership of the United Mine Workers

of America. In the course of the discussion the purpose
of organizing West Virginia in the interest of the unionized mine workers in the Central Competitive Field,
and the probability that it could be organized only by
means of strikes, were repeatedly declared and were disputed by nobody. All who spoke advocated strikes,
differing only as to whether these should be nation-wide
or sectional. Defendant Lewis, in his report, recommended an abandonment of the policy of sectional settlements which had been pursued in the previous year. This
recommendation, interpreted as a criticism of the policy
pursued under the leadership of President Mitchell in
the settlement of the 1906 strike, was the subject of long
and earnest debate, in the course of which Lewis said:
"When we organize West Virginia, when we organize the
unorganized sections of Pennsylvania, we will organize
them by a strike movement." And again, towards the
close of the debate: "No one has made the statement
that we can organize West Virginia without a strike."
Defendant Green took part, favoring the view of Mr.
Lewis that strikes should be treated nationally instead of
sectionally. In the course of his remarks he said: "I
say to you, gentlemen, one reason why I opposed the policy
that was pursued last year was because over in Ohio
we were peculiarly situated. We had West Virginia on
the south and Pennsylvania on the east, and after four
months of a strike in eastern Ohio we had reached the
danger line. We felt keenly the competition from West
Virginia, and during the suspension our mines in Ohio
chafed under the object lesson they had. They saw West
Virginia coal go by, train-load after train-load passing
their doors, when they were on strike. This coal supplied the markets that they should have had. There is
no disguising the fact, something must be done to remedy
this condition. Year after year Ohio has had to go home
and strike in some portion of the district to enforce the

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.

243

Opinion of the Court.

interstate agreement that was signed up here.
.
I confess here and now that the overwhelming sentiment
in Ohio was that a settlement by sections would not correct the conditions we complained of. Now, something
must be done; it is absolutely necessary to protect us
against the competition that comes from the unorganized fields east of us." Mr. Mitchell opposed the view
o f defendant Lewis, reiterating an opinion, repeatedly
expressed before, that West Virginia and the other unorganized fields, "would not be thoroughly organized
except as the result of a successful strike"; but declaring
that "they will not be organized at all, strike or no strike,
unless we are able to support the men in those fields
from the first day they lay down their tools.
Now, I believe it is possible, indeed I believe it is probable, that in the not distant future we will be able to
inaugurate a movement in West Virginia and the other
unorganized fields that will involve them in a strike, and
then we will expect you to furnish the sinews of war, as
you have done in the past, to keep these men in idleness."
The discussion continued during three days, and at the
end of it the report of a committee which expressed disagreement with Vice President Lewis' opposition to sectional settlements and recommended "a continuation
in the future of the same wise, conservative business-like
policies" that had been pursued by President Mitchell,
was adopted by a viva voce vote.
The plain effect of this action was to approve a policy
which, as applied to the concrete case, meant that in
order to relieve the union miners of Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois from the competition of the cheaper product of
the non-union mines of West Virginia, the West Virginia
mines should be "organized" by means of strikes local
to West Virginia, the strike benefits to be paid by assessments upon the union miners in the other States mentioned, while they remained at work.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.

This convention was followed by an annual convention
of Sub-district 5 of District 6, held in the month of
March, 1907, at which defendants Watkins and Rankin
were present as President and Secretary of the sub-district.
Defendant Lewis, as National Vice President, occupied
the chair during several of the sessions. Defendant
Zelenka was present as a delegate, and also Thomas
Hughes, who, while named as a defendant in the presenf
suit, was not served with process. Watkins and Rankin
in their reports recommended the complete unionization
of the mines in the Panhandle counties, with particular
reference to the Hitchman, the Glendale, the Richland,
and two others; and as a result it was resolved "that
the Sub-District officers, together with the District
officers, be authorized to take up the work of organizing
every mine in the Sub-District as quickly as it can be
done."
Evidently in pursuance of this resolution, defendants
Green, Zelenka, and Watkins, about July 1, 1907, called
at plaintiff's office and laid before its general manager,
Mr. Koch, a proposition for the unionization of the mine.
He declined to consider it, but at their request laid it
before plaintiff's board of directors, who rejected the
proposition, and the manager informed Green of this.
In one of the interviews Koch informed these defendants of the terms of plaintiff's working agreement with
its employees to the effect that the mine was to be run
non-union and they were not to become members of the
Union.
About the same time, a Mr. McKinley, who was operating the Richland mine non-union, was interviewed by
the Unlon leaders, notified of the resolution adopted by
the sub-district convention, and, having asked that his
mine be let alone, was met with the threat that they
would secure the support of his men, and that if he did
not recognize the Union they would shut down his mine.

In one of the interviews that ensued he was told that it
was their purpose to organize the Glendale, the Hitchman, the Richland, and some other mines; that at the
Glendale they had twenty-four men who had joined the
organization, "and that they had sixty men who had
signed up or had agreed to join the organization at Hitchman, and that they were going to shut the mine down as
soon as they got a few more men." With respect to their
progress at his own mine he was kept in the dark until
about the middle of October, 1907, when, through the
activities of the organizer Hughes, they succeeded in
shutting it down, and it remained closed until a restraining order was allowed by the court, immediately after
which it resumed non-union.

The evidence renders it clear that Hughes was sent
into the Panhandle to organize all the mines there, in
accordance with the resolution of the sub-district convention. The bill made a statement of his activities, and
alleged that he was acting as an organizer for the Union.
Defendants' final answers made a complete denial, but
in this are contradicted by admissions made in the earlier
answers and by other and undisputed evidence. The
only defendant who testified upon the subject declared
that Hughes was employed by District No. 6 as an organizer, but denied that he had power or authority to shut
down the Hitchman mine.
He arrived at that mine some time in September, 1907,
and remained there or in that vicinity until the latter
part of October, conducting a campaign of organization
at the Hitchman and at the neighboring Glendale and
Richland mines.
The evidence shows that he had distinct and timely
notice that membership in the Union was inconsistent
with the terms of employment at all three mines, and a
violation of the express provisions of the agreement at
the Hitchman and Glendale.

OCTO3ER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

Having unsuccessfully applied to Koch and McKinley
for their co6peration, Hughes proceeded to interview as
many of the men as he could reach and to hold public
meetings in the interest of the Union. There is clear and
uncontradicted evidence that he did not confine himself
to mere persuasion, but resorted to deception and abuse.
In his public speeches he employed abusive language
respecting Mr. Pickett, William Daugherty, and Jim
Jarrett.1 He prophesied, in such a way that ignorant,
foreign-born miners, such as he was addressing, naturally
might believe him to be speaking with knowledge, that
the wages paid by the Hitchman would be reduced unless
the mine was unionized. The evidence as to the methods
he employed in personally interviewing the miners, while
meagre, is significant. Myers, a Hitchman miner, testified: "He told me that he was a good friend of Mr. Koch,
and that Mr. Koch had nothing against having the place
organized again. He said he was a friend of his, and I
made the remark that I would ask Mr. Koch and see if
it was so; and he said no, that was of no use because he
was telling me the truth." He did not confine his attentions to men who already were in plaintiff's employ, but
in addition dissuaded men who had accepted employment from going to work.
A highly significant thing, giving character to Hughes'
entire course of conduct, is that while his solicitation of
the men was more or less public, as necessarily it had to
be, he was careful to keep secret the number and the
names of those who agreed to join the Union. Myers,
being asked to allow his name to be entered bn a book
IMr. Pickett was superintendent of the Hitchman and Glendale
mines, and it was with him that the miners made their agreements
to refrain from membership in the Union; Daugherty and Jarrett
were miners at the Hitchman, and had been, respectively, President
and Financial Secretary of the local union at the time of the 1906
strike, when the local deserted the U. M. W. A.

Opinion of the Court.

that Hughes carried, tried to see the names already entered, "but he would not show anything; he told me he
had it, and I asked him how many names was on it, and
he said he had about enough to 'crack off."' To Stewart,
another Hitchman miner, he said "he was forming a
kind of secret order among the men; he said he had a
few men-he did not state the number of them-and
he said each man was supposed to give him so much
dues to keep it going, and then he said after he got the
majority he would organize the place." Pickett, the
mine superintendent, had learned of only five men at
the Glendale who were inclined to join Hughes' movement; but when these were asked to remain outside
of the mine for a talk, fifteen other men waited with
them, and upon being reminded that while the company
would not try to prevent them from becoming memof the Union, they could not be members and at the
same time work for the Glendale Company, they all
accepted this as equivalent to a notice of discharge.
And, as has been stated, the owner of the Richland,
while repeatedly threatened with unionization, was
kept in the dark as to the progress made by the organizer amongst his employees until the mine was actually
shut down.
The question whether Hughes had "power or authority"
to shut down the Hitchman mine is beside the mark. We
are not here concerned with any question of ultra vires,
but with an actual threat of closing down plaintiff's mine,
made by Hughes while acting as agent of an organized
body of men who indubitably were united in a purpose
to close it unless plaintiff would conform to their wishes
with respect to its management, and who lacked the
power to carry out that purpose only because they had
not as yet persuaded a sufficient number of the Hitchman
miners to join with them, and hence employed Hughes
as an "organizer" and sent him to the mine with the very

object of securing the support of the necessary number of
miners. They succeeded with respect to one of the mines
threatened (the Richland), and preparations of like character were in progress at the Hitchman and the Glendale
at the time the restraining order was made in this cause.
If there be any practical distinction between organizing
the miners and organizing the mine, it has no application
to this case. Unionizing the miners is but a step in the
process of unionizing the mine, followed by the latter
almost as a matter of course. Plaintiff is as much entitled
to prevent the first step as the second, so far as its own
employees are concerned, and to be protected against
irreparable injury resulting from either. Besides, the
evidence shows, without any dispute, that defendants
contemplated no half-way measures, but were bent on
organizing the mine, the "consent" of plaintiff to be
procured through such a control of its employees as would
render any further independent operation of the mine
out of the question. This is evident from the discussions
and resolutions of the international and sub-district conventions, from what was said by defendants Green,
Zelenka, and Watkins to plaintiff's manager, and to the
operator of the Richland, and from all that was said and
done by Hughes in his effort to organize the Hitchman,
Glendale, and Richland mines.
In short, at the time the bill was filed, defendants, although having full notice of the terms of employment
existing between plaintiff and its miners, were engaged
in an earnest effort to subvert those relations without
plaintiff's consent, and to alienate a sufficient number
of the men to shut down the mine, to the end that the
fear of losses through stoppage of operations might coerce
plaintiff into "recognizing the union" at the cost of its
own independence. The methods resorted to by their
"organizer" were such as have been described. The legal
consequences remain for discussion.

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.

249

Opinion of the Court.

The facts we have recited are either admitted or else
proved by clear and undisputed evidence and indubitable
inferences therefrom. The proceedings of the international and sub-district conventions were shown by the
introduction of official verbatim reports, properly authenticated. It is objected that these proceedings, especially in so far as they include the declarations and
conduct of others than the answering defendants, are
not admissible because the existence of a criminal or unlawful conspiracy is not made to appear by evidence
aliunde. The objection is untenable. In order that the
declarations and conduct of third parties may be admissible in such a case, it is necessary to show by independent evidence that there was a combination between
them and defendants, but it is not necessary to show by
independent evidence that the combination was criminal
or otherwise unlawful. The element of illegality may be
shown by the declarations themselves. The rule of evidence is commonly applied in criminal cases, but is of
general operation; indeed, it originated in the law of
partnership. It depends upon the principle that when
any number of persons associate themselves together in
the prosecution of a common plan or enterprise, lawful
or unlawful, from the very act of association there arises
a kind of partnership, each member being constituted
the agent of all, so that the act or declaration of one, in
furtherance of the common object, is the act of all, and
is admissible as primary and original evidence against
them. Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 119; Connecticut

Upon a kindred principle, the declarations and conduct
of an agent, within the scope and in the course of his
agency, are admissible as original evidence against the
principal, just as his own declarations or conduct would
be admissible. Barreda v. Silsbee, 21 How. 146, 164, 165;
Vicksburg & Meridian Railroad v. O'Brien, 119 U. S. 99,
104; LaAbra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, 175 U. S.
423, 498. And since the evidence of Hughes' agency is
clear and undisputed-that as the representative of a
voluntary association of which the answering defendants
were active members, and in the execution of a purpose
to which they all had given consent, and in which some
of them ,were actively co6perating, he was engaged in
an effort to organize the coal mines of the Panhandle
District-it is equally clear that his declarations and
conduct while so doing are evidential against the defendants.
What are the legal consequences of the facts that have
been detailed?
That the plaintiff was acting within its lawful rights in
employing its men only upon terms of continuing nonmembership in the United Mine Workers of America is
not open to question. Plaintiff's repeated costly experiences of strikes and other interferences while attempting
to "run union" were a sufficient explanation of its resolve
to run "non-union," if any were needed. But neither
explanation nor justification is needed. Whatever may
be the advantages of "collective bargaining," it is not
bargaining at all, in any just sense, unless it is voluntary
on both sides. The same liberty which enables men to
form unions, and through the union to enter into agree-

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL. 251

Opinion of the Court.

ments with employers willing to agree, entitles other men
to remain independent of the union and other employers
to agree with them to employ no man who owes any allegiance or obligation to the union. In the latter case,
as in the former, the parties are entitled to be protected
by the law in the enjoyment of the benefits of any lawful agreement they may make. This court repeatedly
has held that the employer is as free to make non-membership in a union a condition of employment, as the working
man is free to join the union, and that this is a part of
the constitutional rights of personal liberty and private
property, not to be taken away even by legislation,
unless through some proper exercise of the paramount
police power. Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161,
174; Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1, 14. In the
present case, needless to say, there is no act of legislation to which defendants may resort for justification.
Plaintiff, having in the exercise of its undoubted rights
established a working agreement between it and its employees, with the free assent of the latter, is entitled to be
protected in the enjoyment of the resulting status, as in
any other legal right. That the employment was "at
will," and terminable by either party at any time, is of
no consequence. In Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 38,
this court ruled upon the precise question as follows: "It
is said that the bill does not show an employment for a
term, and that under an employment at will the complainant could be discharged at any time for any reason cr for
no reason, the motive of the employer being immaterial.
The conclusion, however, that is sought to be drawn is
too broad. The fact that the employment is at the will
of the parties, respectively, does not make it one at the will
of others. The employ6 has manifest interest in the freedom of the employer to exercise his judgment without
illegal interference or compulsion, and, by the weight

of authority, the unjustified interference of third persons
is actionable although the employment is at will." (Citing many cases.)
In short, plaintiff was and is entitled to the good will of
its employees, precisely as a merchant is entitled to the
good will of his customers although they are under no
obligation to continue to deal with him. The value of the
relation lies in the reasonable probability that by properly
treating its employees, and paying them fair wages,
and avoiding reasonable grounds of complaint, it will
be able to retain them in its employ, and to fill vacancies
occurring from time to time by the employment of other
men on the same terms. The pecuniary value of such
reasonable probabilities is incalculably great, and is
recognized .by the law in a variety of relations. See
Brennan v. United Hatters, (cited with approval in Truax

The right of action for persuading an employee to leave

clearly than in West Virginia-and it rests upon fundamental principles of general application, not upon the
English statute of laborers. Thacker Coal Co. v. Burke,

We turn to the matters set up by way of justification
or excuse for defendants' interference with the situation
existing at plaintiff's mine.
The case involves no question of the rights of employees.

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL. 253
229.

Opinion of the Court.

Defendants have no agency for plaintiff's employees, nor
do they assert any disagreement or grievance in their behalf. In fact, there is none; but, if there were, defendants
could not, without agency, set up any rights that employees might have. The right of the latter to strike would
not give to defendants the right to instigate a strike.
The difference is fundamental.
It is suggested as a ground of criticism that plaintiff
endeavored to secure a closed non-union mine through
individual agreements with its employees, as if this furnished some sort of excuse for the employment of coercive measures to secure a closed union shop through a
collective agreement with the Union. It is a sufficient
answer, in law, to repeat that plaintiff had a legal and
constitutional right to exclude union men from its employ. But it may be worth while to say, in addition:
first, that there was no middle ground open to plaintiff;
no option to have an "open shop" employing union men
and non-union men indifferently; it was the Union that
insisted upon closed-shop agreements, requiring even
carpenters employed about a mine to be members of
the Union, and making the employment of any nonunion man a ground for a strike; and secondly, plaintiff
was in the reasonable exercise of its rights in excluding
all union men from its employ, having learned, from
a previous experience, that unless this were done union
organizers might gain access to its mine in the guise of
laborers.
Defendants set up, by way of justification or excuse,
the right of workingmen to form unions, and to enlarge
their membership by inviting other workingmen to join.
The right is freely conceded, provided the objects of the
union be proper and legitimate, which we assume to be
true, in a general sense, with respect to the Union here in
question. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S.
418, 439. The cardinal error of defendants' position lies

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

in the assumption that the right is so absolute that it
may be exercised under any circumstances and without
any qualification; whereas in truth, like other rights that
exist in civilized society, it must always be exercised with
reasonable regard for the conflicting rights of others.
Brennan v. United Hatters, 73 N. J. L. 729, 749. The
familiar maxim, Sic utere tuo ut alienum non leudasliterally translated, "So use your own property as not to
injure that of another person," but by more proper interpretation, "so as not to injure the rights of another,"
(Broom's Leg. Max., 8th ed., 289)-applies to conflicting
rights of every description. For example, where two or
more persons are entitled to use the same road or passage,
each one in using it is under a duty to exercise care not to
interfere with its use by the others, or to damage them
while they are using it. And a most familiar application
is the action for enticing an employee, in which it never
was a justification that defendant wished to retain for
himself the services of the employee. 1 Black. Corn.
429; 3 Id. 142.
Now, assuming defendants were exercising, through
Hughes, the right to invite men to join their Union, still
they had plain notice that plaintiff's mine was run "nonunion," that none of the men had a right to remain at
work there after joining the Union, and that the observance of this agreement was of great importance and value
both to plaintiff and to its men who had voluntarily
made the agreement and desired to continue working
under it. Yet defendants, far from exercising any care
to refrain from unnecessarily injuring plaintiff, deliberately and advisedly selected that method of enlarging
their membership which would inflict the greatest injury
upon plaintiff and its loyal employees. Every Hitchman miner who joined Hughes' "secret order" and permitted his name to be entered upon Hughes' list was
guilty of a breach of his contract of employment and

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

255

Opinion of the Court.

acted a lie whenever thereafter he entered plaintiff's
mine to work. Hughes not only connived at this, but
must be deemed to have caused and procured it, for it
was the main feature of defendants' plan, the sine qua
non of their programme. Evidently it was deemed to
be necessary, in order to "organize the Panhandle by a
strike movement," that at the Hitchman, for example,
man after man should be persuaded to join the Union,
and having done so to remain at work, keeping the employer in ignorance of their number and identity, until
so many had joined that by stopping work in a body they
could coerce the employer and the remaining miners to
"organize the mine," that is, to make an agreement
that none but members of the Union should be employed,
that terms of employment should be determined by negotiation not with the employees but with union officersperhaps residents of other States and employees of competing mines-and that all questions in controversy between the mine operator and the miners should likewise
be settled with outsiders.
True, it is suggested that under the existing contract
an employee was not called upon to leave plaintiff's employ until he actually joined the Union, and that the
evidence shows only an attempt by Hughes to induce
the men to agree to join, but no attempt to induce them
to violate their contract by failing to withdraw from
plaintiff's employment after actually joining. But in a
court of equity, which looks to the substance and essence
of things and disregards matters of form and technical
nicety, it is sufficient to say that to induce men-to agree
to join is but a mode of inducing them to join, and that
when defendants "had sixty men who had signed up or
agreed to join the organization at Hitchman," and were
"going to shut the mine down as soon as they got a few
more men," the sixty were for practical purposes, and
therefore in the sight of equity, already members of the

Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

Union, and it needed no formal ritual or taking of an oath
to constitute them such; their uniting with the Union in
the plan to subvert the system of employment at the
Hitchman mine, to which they had voluntarily agreed
and upon which their employer and their fellow employees
were relying, was sufficient.
But the facts render it plain that what the defendants
were endeavoring to do at the Hitchman mine and neighboring mines cannot be treated as a bona fide effort to
enlarge the membership of the Union. There is no evidence to show, nor can it be inferred, that defendants
intended or desired to have the men at these mines join the
Union, unless they could organize the mines. Without this,
the new members would be added to the number of men
competing for jobs in the organized districts, while nonunion men would take their places in the Panhandle mines.
Except as a means to the end of compelling the owners of
these mines to change their method of operation, the defendants were not seeking to enlarge the union membership.
In any aspect of the matter, it cannot be said that
defendants were pursuing their object by lawful means.
The question of their intentions-of their bona fidescannot be ignored. It enters into the question of malice.
As Bowen, L. J., justly said, in the Mogul Steamship Case,
23 Q. B. Div. 613, "Intentionally to do that which is
calculated in the ordinary course of events to damage,
and which does, in fact, damage another in that other
person's property or trade, is actionable if done without
just cause or excuse." And the intentional infliction of
such damage upon another, without justification or excuse,
is malicious in law. Bitterman v. Louisville & Nashville
R. R. Co., 207 U. S. 205, 223; Brennan v. United Hatters,
73 N. J. L. 729, 744 et seq., and cases cited. Of course,
in a court of equity, when passing upon the right of injunction, damage threatened, irremediable by action at
law, is equivalent to damage done. And we cannot deem

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

257

Opinion of the Court.

the proffered excuse to be a "just cause or excuse," where
it is based, as in this case, upon an assertion of conflicting
rights that are sought to be attained by unfair methods,
and for the very purpose of interfering with plaintiff's
rights, of which defendants have full notice.
Another fundamental error in defendants' position
consists in the assumption that all measures that may be
resorted to are lawful if they are "peaceable "-that is,
if they stop short of physical violence, or coercion through
fear of it. In our opinion, any violation of plaintiff's
legal rights contrived by defendants for the purpose of
inflicting damage, or having that as its necessary effect, is
as plainly inhibited by the law as if it involved a breach
of the peace. A combination to procure concerted
breaches of contract by plaintiff's employees constitutes
such a violation. Flaccus v. Smith, 199 Pa. St. 128; 54
L. R. A. 640; South Wales Miners' Federationv. Glamorgan
Coal Co., [1905] A. C. 239, 244, 250, 253; Jonas Glass Co. v.
Glass Bottle Blowers Association, 77 N. J. Eq. 219, 223.
The present is not a case of merely withholding from
an employer an economic need-as a supply of laboruntil he assents to be governed by union regulations.
Defendants have no supply of labor of which plaintiff
stands in need. By the statement of defendant Lewis
himself, made in his formal report to the Indianapolis
convention of 1907, out of more than 370,000 coal miners
in the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and
West Virginia, less than 80,000 (about 22 per cent.) were
members of the Union. Considering the Panhandle
separately, doubtless the proportion was even smaller,
and the supply of non-union labor ample. There is no
reason to doubt that if defendants had been actuated by
a genuine desire to increase the membership of the Union
without unnecessary injury to the known rights of plaintiff, they would have permitted their proselytes to withdraw from plaintiff's employ when and as they became

245 U. S.

affiliated with the Union-as their contract of employment required them to do-and that in this event plaintiff would have been able to secure an adequate supply
of non-union men to take their places. It was with knowledge of this, and because of it, that defendants, through
Hughes as their agent, caused the new members to remain
at work in plaintiff's mine until a sufficient number of
men should be persuaded to join so as to bring about a
strike and render it difficult if not practically impossible
for plaintiff to continue to exercise its undoubted legal
and constitutional right to run its mine "non-union."
It was one thing for plaintiff to find, from time to time,
comparatively small numbers of men to take vacant
places in a going mine, another and a much more difficult
thing to find a complete gang of new men to start up a
mine shut down by a strike, when there might be a reasonable apprehension of violence at the hands of the
strikers and their sympathizers. The disordered condition of a mining town in time of strike is matter of common knowledge. It was this kind of intimidation, as well
as that resulting from the large organized membership
of the Union, that defendants sought to exert upon plaintiff, and it renders pertinent what was said by this court
in the Gompers Case (221 U. S. 418, 439), immediately
following the recognition of the right to form labor unions:
"But the very fact that it is lawful to form these bodies,
with multitudes of members, means that they have
thereby acquired a vast power, in the presence of which
the individual may be helpless. This power, when unlawfully used against one, cannot be met, except by his
purchasing peace at the cost of submitting to terms which
involve the sacrifice of rights protected by the Constitution; or by standing on such rights and appealing to the
preventive powers of a court of equity. When such appeal
is made it is the duty of government to protect the one
against the many as well as the many against the one."

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

259

Opinion of the Court.

Defendants' acts cannot be justified by any anaJogy
to competition in trade. They are not competitors of
plaintiff; and if they were their conduct exceeds the
bounds of fair trade. Certainly, if a competing trader
should endeavor to draw custom from his rival, not by
offering better or cheaper goods, employing more competent salesmen, or displaying more attractive advertisements, but by persuading the rival's clerks to desert him
under circumstances rendering it difficult or embarrassing
for him to fill their places, any court of equity would
grant an injunction to restrain this as unfair competition.
Upon all the facts, we are constrained to hold that the
purpose entertained by defendants to bring about a
strike at plaintiff's mine in order to compel plaintiff,
through fear of financial loss, to consent to the unionization of the mine as the lesser evil, was an unlawful purpose, and that the methods resorted to by Hughesthe inducing of employees to unite with the Union in an
effort to subvert the system of employment at the mine
by concerted breaches of the contracts of employment
known to be in force there, not to mention misrepresentation, deceptive statements, and threats of pecuniary
loss communicated by Hughes to the men-were unlawful
and malicious methods, and not to be justified as a fair
exercise of the right to increase the membership of the
Union.
There can be no question that plaintiff was threatened
with danger of an immediate strike as a result of the
activities of Hughes. The effect of his arguments and
representations is not to be judged from the testimony
of those witnesses who rejected his overtures. Naturally,
it was not easy for plaintiff to find men who would testify
that they had agreed with Hughes to break their contract with plaintiff. One such did testify. But the true
measure of the extent of his operations and the probability of his carrying them to success are indicated by his

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.

245 U. S.

declaration to Myers that he had about enough names
at the Hitchman to "crack off," by the statement to
McKinley that twenty-four men at the Glendale mine
had joined the organization, and sixty at the Hitchman,
and by the fact that they actually succeeded in shutting
down the Richland about the middle of October. The
declaration made concerning the Glendale is corroborated
by the evidence of what happened at that mine.
That the damage resulting from a strike would be
irremediable at law is too plain for discussion.
Therefore, upon the undisputed facts of the case, and
the indubitable inferences from them, plaintiff is entitled
to relief by injunction. Having become convinced by
three costly strikes, occurring within a period of as many
years, of the futility of attempting to operate under a
closed-shop agreement with the Union, it established the
mine on a non-union basis, with the unanimous approval
of its employees-in fact upon their suggestion-and
under a mutual agreement, assented to by every employee,
that plaintiff would continue to run its mine non-union
and would not recognize the United Mine Workers of
America; that if any man wanted to become a member of
that Union he was at liberty to do so, but he could not be
a member and remain in plaintiff's employ. Under that
agreement plaintiff ran its mine for a year and more,
and, so far as appears, without the slighest disagreement
between it and its men, and without any grievance on
their part. Thereupon defendants, having full notice of
the working agreement between plaintiff and its men, and
acting without any agency for those men, but as representatives of an organization of mine workers in other
States, and in order to subject plaintiff to such participation by the Union in the management of the mine as
necessarily results from the making of a closed-shop
agreement, sent their agent to the mine, who, with
full notice of, and for the very purpose of subverting,

Opinion of the Court.

the status arising from plaintiff's working agreement and
subjecting the mine to the Union control, proceeded,
without physical violence, indeed, but by persuasion
accompanied with threats of a reduction of wages and
deceptive statements as to the attitude of the mine management, to induce plaintiff's employees to join the Union
and at the same time to break their agreement with plaintiff by remaining in its employ after joining; and this
for the purpose not of enlarging the membership of the
Union, but of coercing plaintiff, through a strike or the
threat of one, into recognition of the Union.
As against the answering defendants, plaintiff's right
to an injunction is clear; as to the others named as defendants, but not served with process, the decree is erroneous, as already stated.
Respecting the sweep of the injunction, we differ somewhat from the result reached by the District Court.
So far as it restrains--.() Interfering or attempting to
interfere with plaintiff's employees for the purpose of
unionizing plaintiff's mine without its consent, by representing or causing to be represented to any of plaintiff's
employees, or to any person who might become an employee of plaintiff, that such person will stiffer or is likely
to suffer some loss or trouble in continuing in or in entering
the employment of plaintiff, by reason of plaintiff not
recognizing the Union, or because plaintiff runs a nonunion mine; (2) Interfering or attempting to interfere
with plaintiff's employees for the purpose of unionizing
the mine without plaintiff's consent, and in aid. of such
purpose knowingly and wilfully bringing about the breaking by plaintiff's employees of contracts of service known
at the time to exist with plaintiff's present and future employees; (3) Knowingly and wilfully enticing plaintiff's
employees, present or future, to leave plaintiff's service

Mine Workers of America or runs a non-union mine,

etc.; (4) Interfering or attempting to interfere with
plaintiff's employees so as knowingly and wilfully to
bring about the breaking by plaintiff's employees, present
and future, of their contracts of service, known to the
defendants to exist, and especially from knowingly and
wilfully enticing such employees, present or future, to
leave plaintiff's service without plaintiff's consent; (5)
Trespassing on or entering upon the gTounds and premises
of plaintiff or its mine for the purpose of interfering
therewith or hindering or obstructing its business, or with
the purpose of compelling or inducing, by threats, intimidation, violent or abusive language, or persuasion, any of
plaintiff's employees to refuse or fail to perform their
duties as such; and (6) Compelling or inducing or attempting to compel or induce, by threats, intimidation, or abusive or violent language, any of plaintiff s employees to
leave its service or fail or refuse to perform their duties as
such employees, or compelling or attempting to compel
by like means any person desiring to seek employment in
plaintiff's mine and works from so accepting employment
therein;---the decree is fully supported by the proofs.
But it goes further, and awards an injunction against
picketing and against acts of physical violence, and we
find no evidence that either of these forms of interference
was threatened. The decree should be modified by eliminating picketing and physical violence from the sweep of
the injunction, but without prejudice to plaintiff's right
to obtain an injunction hereafter against these forms of
interference if proof shall be produced, either in proceedings supplemental to this action or in an independent action, that such an injunction is needed.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed,
and the decree of the District Court is modified as above
stated, and as so modified it is affirmed, and the cause
is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS,

This suit was begun October 24, 1907. The Hitchman
Coal & Coke Company, plaintiff below, is the owner of a
coal mine in West Virginia. John Mitchell and nine
others, defendants below, were then the chief executive
officers of the United Mine Workers of America and of its
district and sub-district organizations having "jurisdiction" over the territory in which plaintiff's mine is
situated; and were sued both individually and as such
officers. The mine had been "unionized" about three
years prior to April 16th, 1906; and until about that date
was operated as a "union" mine, under a collective agreement with a local union of the United Mine Workers
of America. Then a strike was declared by the union;
and a short shut-down followed. While the strike so declared was still in force, as the bill alleges, the company
re-opened the mine as a closed non-union mine. Thereafter persons applying for work were required as a condition of obtaining employment to agree that they would
not, while in the service of the company, be a member
of the union, and if they joined the union would withdraw from the company's employ.'
'About two months after the restraining order was issued in this
case the plaintiff company began the practice of requiring applicants
for work to sign employment cards, in the following terms:
"I am employed by and work for the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company with the express understanding that I am not a member of the
United Mine Workers of America, and will not become so while an
employee of the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company; that the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company is run non-union and agrees with me that
it will run non-union while I am in its employ. If at any time I am
employed by the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company I want to become
connected with the United Mine Workers of America, or any affiliated
organization, I agree to withdraw from the employment of said company, and agree that while I am in the employ of that company I will
not make any efforts amongst its employees to bring about the union-

Alleging that efforts were being made illegally to unionize its mine "without its consent," the company brought
in the United States Circuit (now District) Court for
the Northern District of West Virginia this suit to enjoin
such efforts. District Judge Dayton granted a restraining order upon the filing of the bill. An order was entered
May 26, 1908, continuing it as a temporary injunction.
A motion to modify the same was denied, September 21,
1909. 172 Fed. Rep. 963. An appeal from this order was
dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, March 11,
1910. 176 Fed. Rep. 549. The case was then heard on
the merits; defendants having denied in their answer all
the charges of unlawful conduct set forth in the bill; and on
January 18, 1913, a decree was entered for a perpetual
injunction substantially in the form of the restraining
order. 202 Fed. Rep. 512. This decree was reversed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals on June 1, 1914 (21.4 Fed.
Rep. 685); but a stay was granted pending an application to this court for a writ of certiorari. The company
appealed to this court and also applied for a writ of certiorari. The appeal was dismissed, as the jurisdiction of
izing of that mine against the company's wish. I have either read the
above or heard the same read."
Prior to that time, the agreement rested in oral understanding
merely, and is sufficiently indicated in the following excerpts from the
testimony of the mine superintendent as to what he told the men applying for employment:

"I also told them that any man who wanted to become a member of
the United Mine Workers-that that was his business-but he could
not be a member of the United Mine Workers and be affiliated with
the United Mine Workers and be under the employ of the Hitchman
Coal & Coke Company, or be under the jurisdiction of the United
Mine Workers; that the mine was run non-union so far as the United
Mine Workers of America were concerned.
"Q. You mean you made every man understand that while he
worked for the Hitchman Company he must keep out of the union?
"A. Yes, sir; or at least they said they understood it."

the Circuit (District) Court was rested wholly upon diversity of citizenship, plaintiff being a corporation organized under the laws of West Virginia and all the defendants citizens and residents of other States. 241 U. S.
644. A writ of certiorari was granted, however, March 13,
1916. The case was argued at that term and a reargument
was ordered.
The District Court held that the United Mine Workers
of America with its subordinate branches constitutes an
unlawful organization-illegal both under the law of
West Virginia and under the Federal Anti-Trust Act;
that its long continued effort to unionize the mines of
West Virginia had not been "in the interest either of the
betterment of mine labor in the State or of upholding
that free commerce in coal between the States guaranteed
by Federal law," but to restrain if not destroy it for the
benefit of "rival operators and producers in Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana, competitive
fields" in which the mines had been unionized; and that
"in pursuit of its unlawful purposes" the union "have
sought and still seek to compel the plaintiff . . . to
submit to contractual relations with it as an organization
relating to the employment of labor and production
contrary to the will and wish of said company; that its
officers, in pursuance of such unlawful effort to monopolize labor and restrain trade, and with knowledge of the
express contracts existing between this plaintiff and its
employees, have unlawfully sought to cause the breach
of the said contracts on the part of its said employees."
The decree, besides the usual injunction against threat,
intimidation, force or violence, and against inducing
breaches of employees' contracts or trespassing upon
plaintiff's property, enjoined defendants (and others hereinafter described), among other things, from1. "Representing ["for the purpose of unionizing

Three of the defendants-Mitchell, Wilson and Hughes
-were never served with process and did not enter any
appearance except to object to the jurisdiction of the
court over them. Of the remaining seven all but two
had, prior to the entry of the final decree, ceased to hold

any office either in the United Mine Workers of America
or in any of the district or sub-district organizations.
Nevertheless the decree directed that the injunction issue
against each of the ten original defendants, "individually";
and also in their official capacities against their successors
in office (who were named in the decree) although these
had not been served with process or been named in the
bill; the court declaring such persons to be "before the
court by representation through service having been
made upon their said predecessors in office, sued as such
officers and as members of the United Mine Workers of
America." The decree extended the injunction, among
others, also to "all persons now members of said United
Mine Workers of America, and all persons who though
not now members do become members of said United
Mine Workers of America."
The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the decree of
the District Court, held that the United Mine Workers of
America was not an unlawful organization under the laws
of West Virginia, that its validity under the Federal
Anti-Trust Act could not be considered in this proceeding;
that so long as defendants "refrained from resorting to
unlawful measures to effectuate" their purpose "they
could not be said to be engaged in a conspiracy to unionize
plaintiff's mine"; that "the evidence fails to show that
any unlawful methods were resorted to by these defendants in this instance"; and specifically that there was
nothing in the individual contracts which barred defendants from inducing the employees to join' the union. With
these conclusions I agree substantially.
First: The alleged illegality of the United Mine Workers
of America under the law of West Virginia.
The United Mine Workers of America does not appear
to differ essentially in character and purpose from other
international unions which, like it, are affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor. Its membership is said

' 245 U. S.

to be larger than that of any other; and it may be more
powerful. But the common law does not limit the size
of unions or the degree to which individual workmen
may by union increase their bargaining power. As stated
in Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418,
439: "The law, therefore, recognizes the right of workingmen to unite and to invite others to join their ranks,
thereby making available the strength, influence and
power that come from such association." We do not find
either in the decisions or the statutes of West Virginia
anything inconsistent with the law as declared by this
court. The union is not an unlawful organization, and
is not in itself an unlawful conspiracy. We have no occasion to consider the legality of the specific provisions
contained in its constitution or by-laws.
Second: The alleged illegality of the United Mine Workers
of America under the FederalAnti-Trust Act.
The District Judge undertook to pass upon the legality
of the United Mine Workers of America under the Federal
Anti-Trust Act; but the question was not in issue in the
case. It had not been raised in the bill or by answer.
Evidence bearing upon the issue was properly objected
to by defendants and should have been excluded.
Third: The alleged conspiracy against the West Virginia
Mines.
It was doubtless the desire of the United Mine Workers
to unionize every mine on the American continent and
especially those in West Virginia which compete directly
with the mines ofWestern Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
and other States already unionized. That desire and
the purpose to effect it were not unlawful. They were
part of a reasonable effort to improve the condition of
workingmen engaged in the industry by strengthening
their bargaining power through unions; and extending
the field of union power. No conspiracy to shut down or
otherwise injure West Virginia was proved, nor was there

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

BRANDEIS,

269

J., dissenting.

any averment in the bill of such conspiracy, or any issue
otherwise raised by the pleadings which justified the
consideration of that question by the District Court.'
Fourth: "Unionizing plaintiff's mine without plaintiff's
consent."
The fundamental prohibition of the injunction is
against acts done "for the purpose of unionizing plain-

tiff's mine without plaintiff's consent."

Unionizing a

shop does not mean inducing the employees to become
members of the union. 2 It means inducing the employer
' This alleged conspiracy not being in issue, the District Court improperly allowed the introduction of, and considered, a mass of documents referring to various mine workers' conventions, and joint conventions of miners and operators held years previous to the filing of the
bill. Judge Dayton laid great stress on reported declarations of the
delegates to these conventions, although the declarations of alleged
co-conspirators were obviously inadmissible, there being no foundation
for the conspiracy charge.
2 A witness for the defendants testified as follows:
"There is a difference between unionizing a mine and unionizing the
employees in a mine; unionizing the employees is having the men
join the organization; unionizing a mine is creating joint relations between the employers and employees; a mine cannot be unionized unless
the employer enters into contractual relations with the union; it is not
the policy or purpose of the United Mine Workers as an organization
to coerce a man into doing a thing against his will; this distinction
between unionizing a mine and unionizing the employees of a mine has
existed since the organization came about, and this method of unionizing a mine existed in 1906 and 1907."
A witness for the plaintiff testified that "the term 'union,' when
applied to mining, means the United Mine Workers, and a union mine
is a mine that is under their jurisdiction and so recognized
.
The contrary is "non-union or open shop." And further, "The men
might be unionized at a mine and the mine owners not recognize the
union. That would in effect be an open shop. When I said 'unionize
the employees' I meant practically all of the employees; but a union
mine, as I understand it, is one wherein the closed shop is practically
enforced." In such case, the witness explained, the operator would be
practically in contract relation with the organization.
It was also testified: "The difference between organizing the men at

to enter into a collective agreement with the union governing the relations of the employer to the employees.
Unionizing implies, therefore, at least formal consent of
the employer. Both plaintiff and defendants insisted
upon exercising the right to secure contracts for a closed
shop. The plaintiff sought to secure the closed non-union
shop through individual agreements with employees.
The defendants sought to secure the closed union shop
through a collective agreement with the union. Since
collective bargaining is legal, the fact that the workingmen's agreement is made not by individuals directly
with the employer, but by the employees with the union
and by it, on their behalf, with the employer, is of no
significance in this connection. The end being lawful,
defendant's efforts to unionize the mine can be illegal,
only if the methods or means pursued were unlawful;
unless indeed there is some special significance in the
expression "unionizing without plaintiff's consent."
It is urged that a union agreement curtails the liberty
of the operator. Every agreement curtails the liberty
of those who enter into it. The test of legality is not
whether an agreement curtails liberty, but whether the
parties have agreed upon some thing which the law prohibits or declares otherwise to be inconsistent with the
public welfare. The operator by the union agreement
the mine and organizing the mine is that when the miners are organized the work of organizing the mine is only just started. They next
proceed to meet with the operator who owns the mine, or operates
it, for the purpose of making contracts or agreements. Under the con-

stitution and methods of the United Mine Workers a mine cannot be
organized without the consent of the owner, and it is not the object
or purpose of the United Mine Workers to do so, and never has been;
it has never been attempted as far as witness knows. After a mine

has been organized, the agreement between the employer and the organization is paramount. The constitution of the organization has
nothing to do with the workings afterwards; that agreement does

not take away from the operator the control of his men."

HITCHMAN COAL & CORE CO. v. MITCHELL. 271

BRANDEIS, J.,

dissenting.

binds himself: (1) to employ only members of the union;
(2) to negotiate with union officers instead of with employees individually the scale of wages and the hours of
work; (3) to treat with the duly constituted representatives of the union to settle disputes concerning the discharge of men and other controversies arising out of the
employment. These are the chief features of a "unionizing" by which the employer's liberty is curtailed.
Each of them is legal. To obtain any of them or all of
them men may lawfully strive and even strike. And,
if the union may legally strike to obtain each of the
things for which the agreement provides, why may it
not strike or use equivalent economic pressure to secure
an agreement to provide them?
It is also urged that defendants are seeking to "coerce"
plaintiff to "unionize" its mine. But coercion, in a legal
sense, is not exerted when a union merely endeavors to
induce employees to join a union with the intention thereafter to order a strike unless the employer consents to
unionize his shop. Such pressure is not coercion in a
legal sense. The employer is free either to accept the
agreement or the disadvantage. Indeed, the plaintiff's
whole case is rested upon agreements secured under
similar pressure of economic necessity or disadvantage.
If it is coercion to threaten to strike unless plaintiff consents to a closed union shop, it is coercion also to threaten
not to give one employment unless the applicant will consent to a closed non-union shop. The employer may sign
the union agreement for fear that labor may not be otherwise obtainable; the workman may sign the individual
agreement for fear that employment may not be otherwise obtainable. But such fear does not imply coercion
in a legal sense.
In other words an employer, in order to effectuate the
closing of his shop to union labor, may exact an agreement to that effect from his employees. The agreement

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

245 U. S.

itself being a lawful one, the employer may withhold from
the men an economic need-employment--until they
assent to make it. Likewise an agreement closing a shop
to non-union labor being lawful, the union may withhold from an employer an economic need-labor-until
he assents to make it. In a legal sense an agreement
entered into, under such circumstances, is voluntarily
entered into; and as the agreement is in itself legal, no
reason appears why the general rule that a legal end
may be pursued by legal means should not be applied.
Or, putting it in other words, there is nothing in the
character of the agreement which should make unlawful
means used to attain it, which in other connections are
recognized as lawful.
Fifth: There was no attempt to induce employees to violate
their contracts.
The contract created an employment at will; and the
employee was free to leave at any time. The contract
did not bind the employee not to join the union; and he
was free to join it at any time. The contract merely
bound him to withdraw from plaintiff's employ, if he
joined the union. There is evidence of an attempt to
induce plaintiff's employees to agree to join the union;
but none whatever of any attempt to induce them to
violate their contract. Until an employee actually
joined the union he was not, under the contract, called
upon to leave plaintiff's employ. There consequently
would be no breach of contract until the employee both
joined the union and failed to withdraw from plaintiff's
employ. There was no evidence that any employee was
persuaded to do that or that such a course was contemplated. What perhaps was intended was to secure
agreements or assurances from individual employees
that they would join the union when a large number
of them should have consented to do so; with the purpose,
when such time arrived, to have them join the union

HITCHMAN COAL & COKE CO. v. MITCHELL.
229.

BRANDEIS,

273

J., dissenting.

together and strike-unless plaintiff consented to unionize the mine. Such a course would have been clearly
permissible under the contract.
Sixth: Merely persuading employees to leave plaintiff's
employ or others not to enter it was not unlawful.
To induce third persons to leave an employment is
actionable if done maliciously and without justifiable
cause although such persons are free to leave at their
own will. Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 38; Thacker
Coal Co. v. Burke, 59 W. Va. 253. It is equally actionable
so to induce others not to enter the service. The individual contracts of plaintiff with its employees added nothing
to its right in this connection, since the employment was
terminable at will.
As persuasion, considered merely as a means, is clearly
legal, defendants were within their rights if, and only if,
their interference with the relation of plaintiff to its employees was for justifiable cause. The purpose of interfering was confessedly in order to strengthen the union,
in the belief that thereby the condition of workmen engaged in mining would be improved; the bargaining power
of the individual workingman was to be strengthened by
collective bargaining; and collective bargaining was to
be ensured by obtaining the union agreement. It should
not, at this day, be doubted that to induce workingmen
to leave or not to enter an employment in order to advance such a purpose is justifiable when the workmen
are not bound by contract to remain in such employment.
Seventh: There was no "threat, violence or intimidation."
The decree enjoined "threats, violence or intimidation." Such action would, of course, be unlawful though
employed in a justifiable cause. But there is no evidence
that any of the defendants have resorted to such means.
The propaganda among plaintiff's employees was conducted almost entirely by one man, the defendant Hughes,
a District No. 6 organizer. His actions were orderly and

peaceable, consisting of informal talks with the men,
and a few quietly conducted public meetings,' in which
he argued the benefits of organization and pointed out
to the men that, although the company was then paying
them according to the union scale, there would be nothing
to prevent a later reduction of wages unless the men
united. He also urged upon the men that if they lost
their present jobs, membership in the union was requisite
to obtaining employment in the union mines of the neighboring States. But there is no suggestion that he exceeded the moderate bounds of peaceful persuasion, and
indeed, if plaintiff's witnesses are to be believed, men
with whom Hughes had talked, his argument made no
impression on them, and they expressed to him their
satisfaction with existing conditions at the mine.
When this suit was filed no right of the plaintiff had
been infringed and there was no reasonable ground to
believe that any of its rights would be interfered with;
and, in my opinion, the Circuit Court of Appeals properly
reversed the decree of the District Court, and directed
that the bill be dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES and MR. JUSTICE CLARKE concur

in this dissent.
