SEABOARD AIR LINE RAILWAY v. STATE OF
NORTH CAROLINA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA.
No. 18. Submitted November 7, 1917.-Decided December 10, 1917.
The power of a State under the Webb-Kenyon Law to forbid shipment
into its territory of intoxicating liquor from other States includes
the lesser power to prescribe by law the conditions under which such
shipments may be allowed.
The Webb-Kenyon Law having subjected interstate shipments of
intoxicating liquor to state legislation, a state law requiring carriers
to keep records of such shipments, open for the inspection of any
officer or citizen, is valid, notwithstanding the prohibition of ยง 15
of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended June 18, 1910, against
the divulging of information by interstate carriers.
Section 5, North Carolina Public Laws, 1913, e. 44, p. 76, sustained.
169 N. Car. 295, affirmed.

case is stated in the opinion.

book shall be open for inspection by any officer or citizen,
and makes failure so to do a misdemeanor.
Plaintiff in error was indicted at the May Term, 1914,
Superior Court, Wake County, upon a charge of violating
ยง 5 by refusing, in the preceding January, to permit a
citizen to inspect its record showing shipments of spirituous and malt liquors transported from Virginia into
that county, said record containing the "names of the
consignors, consignees, date of the receipt and delivery of
said shipments, and to whom delivered."
The jury returned a special verdict in which they found:
"That R. L. Davis, on a date prior to the starting of
this prosecution, he being at that time a citizen of the
county of Wake, State of North Carolina, went to the
office of the defendant company during its business hours,
and while said office was open, and demanded of the agent
that he be allowed to inspect the book kept by the defendant showing shipments of liquor from points outside
of the State of North Carolina to the city of Raleigh";
"the agent of the defendant stated that he was instructed
to and did refuse to allow
.
the inspection";
"Davis had no legal process and did not make any demand under any legal process, and at the time of the
alleged demand he was neither a State nor Federal officer
of any kind of any State or Territory"; "he was seeking
information from said book for the purpose of .prosecuting
persons suspected of violating the law of North Carolina";
and "was seeking general information as to shipments of
whiskey into the city of .Raleigh from points in another
State, and that he had in his mind specially an effort to
see what evidence could be procured against one or more
specific parties in the city of Raleigh, meaning by the
words 'general information' that he was seeking to ascertain who were the consignees of liquor and the quantities
they were receiving, for the purpose of prosecuting such
parties as may be charged or suspected with the violation

of the prohibition laws of the State"; and that he "had
no authority except that which existed, if any, by virtue
of the fact that he was at that time a citizen of the State."
Upon this special verdict the State Supreme Court adjudged plaintiff in error guilty as charged, 169 N. Car. 295;
and it now maintains the judgment is erroneous, for reasons following:
I. Section 5, c. 44, supra, is void because an attempt by
the State to regulate interstate commerce, in that it imposes as a condition precedent to delivery that the carrier
shall keep a separate book containing name of person to
whom liquor is shipped, amount and kind received, date
of receipt and delivery, by whom and to whom delivered;
and the consignee is required to receipt therefor before
delivery.
II. In order to comply with ยง 5 by permitting records of
interstate shipments of liquor to be inspected by a mere
citizen, the carrier would necessarily violate the provisions
of ยง 15, Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended June 18,
1910 (36 Stat. 539, 551, 553), which prohibit such action
except under circumstances specified. (These are copied

consignee, any information concerning the nature, kind, quantity,

to solicit or knowingly receive any such information which may be so

Opinion of the Court.

III. The Webb-Kenyon Law (Act of Congress, March 1,
1913, entitled "An Act divesting intoxicating liquors of
their interstate character in certain cases," 37 Stat. 699)
cannot affect the application of these principles to shipments destined to points in Wake County, because it
relates to liquors intended to be received, possessed, sold
or used in violation of state law; and to receive or possess
liquor in any quantity in that county is not unlawful.
For some years it has been the established policy of
North Carolina, "approved by popular vote and expressed
and enforced by the general and many local statutes, that,
except in very restricted instances, the manufacturing
and sale of intoxicating liquors shall not be allowed."
Smith v. Express Company (1914), 166 N. Car. 155, 157.
Since our decision in Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., 242 U. S. 311, 320, 324, it has not been open
to serious question that the Webb-Kenyon Law is a valid
enactment; that "its purpose was to prevent the immunity
characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to
permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in
States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a
means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at
naught"; and that under it a State may inhibit shipused; Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent
the giving of such information in response to any legal process issued
under the authority of any state or federal court, or to any officer or
agent of the Government of the United States, or of any State or Territory, in the exercise of his powers, or to any officer or other duly authorized person seeking such information for the prosecution of persons
charged with or suspected of crime; or information given by a common
carried to another carrier or its duly authorized agent, for the purpose
of adjusting mutual traffic accounts in the ordinary course of business
of such carriers.
"Any person, corporation, or association violating any of the provisions of the next preceding paragraph of this section shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and for each offense, on conviction, shall pay
to the United States a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars."

ments therein of intoxicating liquors from another by a
common carrier although intended for the consignee's
personal use where such use is not actually forbidden.
Plainly, therefore, after that enactment, nothing in the
laws or Constitution of the United States restricted North
Carolina's power to make shipment of intoxicants into
Wake County a penal offence irrespective of any personal
right in a consignee there to have and consume liquor of
that character.
The challenged act instead of interposing an absolute
bar against all such shipments, as it was within the power
of the State to do, in effect permitted them upon conditions intended to secure publicity, to the end that public
policy might not be set at naught by subterfuge and indirection. The greater power includes the less.
The provisions of ยง 15, Act to Regulate Commerce, here
relied on were intended to apply to matters within the
exclusive control of the Federal Government; and when
by a subsequent act Congress rendered interstate shipments of intoxicating liquors subject to state legislation,
those provisions necessarily ceased to be paramount in
respect of them.

Affirmed.
