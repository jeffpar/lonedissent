TOWNE v. EISNER, COLLECTOR OF UNITED
STATES INTERNAL REVENUE FOR THE THIRD
DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 563.

Argued December 12, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.

In an action to recover back money collected and retained by the
Government, over plaintiff's protest, as a tax on income under the
Income Tax Law of 1913, plaintiff alleged that that upon which the
tax was levied, a stock dividend based on accumulated profits, was
not "income" within the true intent of the statute, and that if the
statute so intended it was so far unconstitutional, because in the
Sixteenth Amendment, upon which its validity depended, the term
"income" could not be construed to embrace such dividends. Held,
that there was thus presented, not merely a question whether the
statute had been wrongly understood and applied, but also a question of the scope of the Amendment, which afforded jurisdiction to
review both questions by direct writ of error to the District Court.
The value of new shares, issued as a stock dividend and representing
merely surplus profits transferred to the capital account of the corporation, is not taxable to the share holders as income within the
meaning of the Income Tax Law of 1913. So held where the profits
were earned before January 1, 1913, and the transfer and dividend
were voted December 17, 1913, and the distribution, ratably to shareholders of record on the 26th of that month, took place on January 2, 1914.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles E. Hughes, with whom Mr. George Welwood
Murray, Mr. Charles P. Howland and Mr. Louis H. Porter
were on the briefs, for plaintiff in error:
The constitutionality of § II of the Act of 1913, con-

strued to be applicable to the plaintiff's stock, is drawn
in question. Before the Sixteenth Amendment there were
two kinds of income, subject to different constitutional
rules as to taxation, viz: (1) Gains and profits from "business, privileges, employments and vocations." These
were subject to excise taxes. (2) Income from real or per-

sonal property, as such. Taxes on real or personal property, and on the income derived therefrom, because of its
ownership, were held to be direct taxes, requiring apportionment among the States according to population. The
tax in controversy is laid directly upon the property in
question, as such, because of its ownership. Investments
in stock are unquestionably within the rule of Pollock v.
Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601, 637. The case
at bar, therefore, concerns a direct tax which must be

apportioned unless the stock in question constitutes income under the Sixteenth Amendment.
The stock in question is not income within the meaning
of the Sixteenth Amendment. A "stock dividend" is
not income to the stockholder receiving it, but is a mere
readjustment of the evidence of the stockholder's interest
already owned. The "stock dividend" takes nothing from
the property of the corporation and adds nothing to the
interests of the stockholders. The only change in substance is that, instead of the property represented thereby
being distributed to stockholders, it is permanently fixed
as capital so that it cannot be distributed. Gibbons v.

Illinois, 309; Kaufman v. Charlottesville Mills Co., 93 Virginia, 673; Williams v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 93
N. Y. 162, 189. The stock in question was based on earnings which had been accumulated by the corporation
prior to January 1, 1913, that is, prior to the adoption of
the Sixteenth Amendment, and neither this stock nor the
accumulated surplus which it represented was subject
to taxation without apportionment as being income
within the meaning of that Amendment. It is the decided
weight of authority even in those jurisdictions which have
established a doctrine of apportionment between the
tenant for life and remainderman, that a "stock dividend"
does not go to the life beneficiary of the income, in case
the stock, where it is issued after the creation of the life
tenancy, is based on surplus accumulated before the life
tenancy began. Matter of Osborne, 209 N. Y. 450; Lang v.
Lang's Executor, 57 N. J. Eq. 325; Day v. Faulks, 79 N. J.
E4. 66; 81 id. 173; Will of Pabst, 146 Wisconsin, 330.
The courts upon whose decisions the Government has
relied look through the "stock dividend" to the fund
upon which it is based. This is a limitation inconsistent
with the position that the "stock dividend" should be
regarded as income per se. And when, in this case, we
look through the stock dividend to the fund upon which
it rests, we find a surplus invested in plant and property,
all of which had been accumulated prior to January 1,
1913. The Sixteenth Amendment had no application to
income or earnings accumulated prior to its adoption.
It was not the purpose to endow the Congress with power
to reach, without apportionment, accumulations of property already effected. Shreveport v. Cole, 129 U. S. 36, 43;
Brushaberv. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 20.
"Income" in an income tax law, unless it is otherwise
specified, means cash or its equivalent. It does not mean

word "dividends" used in the Act of 1913. If Congress
had intended to embrace "stock dividends" based on
surplus accumulations capitalized Congress would have
said so. Hyatt v. Allen, 56 N. Y. 553, 556; Gibbons v.
Mahon, 136 U. S. 549, 569; Income Tax Act of 1913,
Section II, subd. 2-B, 38 Stat. 166. The tax for which
the Act of 1913 provides is an annual tax upon the
entire net income arising or accruing in the preceding
calendar year. For the year 1913 the tax was to be
computed on the net income accruing after March 1st.

The SolicitorGeneral, with whom Mr. William C. Herron
was on the brief, for defendant in error:
As the case does not involve the constitutionality but
merely the construction of a law of the United Statesthe Income Tax section of the Act of October 3, 1913-,
the writ of error should be dismissed. American Sugar Refining Co. v. United States, 211 U. S. 155, 161, 162; Ar-

United States, 240 U. S. 60, 65; Shaw v. United States, 212
U. S. 559; Sloan v. United States, 193 U. S. 614, 620. The
question is whether the stock dividend was a mere readjustment of capital or whether it constituted income to
the plaintiff. This is a question to be determined by a construction of the statute and does not involve the Constitution. The constitutionality of the act is settled by Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1.
The claim that the act is unconstitutional if construed to
cover dividends, whether in stock or in cash, derived from
earnings prior to the Sixteenth Amendment, is denied in
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., supra; Stanton v.
Baltic Mining Co., 240 U. S. 103; Edwards v. Keith, 231
Fed. Rep. 110, certiorari denied, 243 U. S. 638. See also
Memphis &c. R. R. Co. v. United States, 108 U. S. 228, 234.
"Stock dividends" are taxable under the provisions of
the Act of 1913. The term "dividends" denotes merely
a species falling within the genus "income," and the question is whether "stock dividends" are included within the
term "income arising or accruing from all sources."
"Capital" represents the wealth or property of a person at
a given instant of time; "income" represents the advantage, service, or use actually rendered by capital to its
owner during a period of time. Under the act, income
need not be money, but may be any advantage or service
capable of easy, accurate, monetary appraisement. State
courts have held that the term "income" includes the
passing of shares of stock. Union &c. Trust Co. v. Taintor,
85 Connecticut, 452; Gray v. Hemenway, 212 Massachusetts, 239; Leland v. Hayden, 102 Massachusetts, 542, 551.
There is a strong presumption that the distribution of
this stock dividend was an advantage to the stockholders
from the fact that they desired it and passed the resolutions directing it. These advantages were: (1) A transfer

TOWNE v. EISNER.
418.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

of the surplus and undivided profits from the plenary
control of the corporation to a control largely in the stockholder. (2) An assurance that a declaration of dividends
would in the future specifically take account of this surplus and be declared upon it. (3) A muniment of title
which enables the stockholder to deal easily with his interest in the surplus by a mere assignment of his new
stock. The latter is a real advantage and of great value.
In re Evans (1913), 1 Ch. Div. 23, 30, 31. These advantages constitute "income" to the stockholder because they
flow to him from his property rights (i. e., "capital") in the
corporation, and are capable of easy, accurate, monetary
appraisement. They accrued to him because of his ownership of a portion of the original capital stock; that they
were capable of easy, monetary appraisement is demonstrated by the fact that there was a regular market quotation upon them.
True, the surplus always belonged to the stockholder,
but not in the strict sense and to the full extent of control
obtaining in the case of original capital. The transfer
gave him new rights. It cannot be said that the corporation lost nothing or that the stockholder gained nothing.
The former lost its plenary control over the surplus; instead of being indebted to "surplus," with a consequent
free use of such funds, it became indebted to "capital,"
with a limited use of the funds. The latter gained a
direct right against the corporation instead of an indirect
interest in the "surplus." Counsel contend that the surplus was put in a position where it could not be distributed
as dividends or income. But it gained this position by
distribution; by conversion into capital. It passed to the
stockholder as income en bloc, and of course could not
produce income again in that form until another complete
change took place.
The rule as between life tenant and remainderman,
involved in Gibbons v. Mahon, 136 U. S. 549, depends on

equitable considerations, but a statute levying a tax must
be rigorously applied according to its correct construction,
no matter what hardships may be caused thereby. In
Bailey v. Railroad Co., 22 Wall. 604, 106 U. S. 109, it was
undoubtedly held in the first error proceedings that a
stock dividend was, and could lawfully be, taxed under
the Income Act Tax of 1864. Gibbons v. Mahon seems to
recognize this, p. 560. Reviewing the decisions of this
court in the first Bailey Case, in Gibbons v. Mahon, and in
Logan County v. United States, 169 U. S. 255, comparing
them, and considering carefully the due weight to be given
to each as an authority in the case at bar, it is submitted
that the question whether a stock dividend is "income"
within the meaning of an act taxing "net income arising
or accruing from all sources" is not foreclosed by authority.
Mr. Gordon M. Buck, by leave of court, filed a brief as
amicus curice.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit to recover the amount of a tax paid under
duress in respect of a stock dividend alleged by the Government to be income. A demurrer to the declaration
was sustained by the District Court and judgment was
entered for the defendant. 242 Fed. Rep. 702. The
facts alleged are that the corporation voted on December 17, 1913, to transfer $1,500,000 surplus, being profits
earned before January 1, 1913, to its capital account,
and to issue fifteen thousand shares of stock representing
the same to its stockholders of record on December 26;
that the distribution took place on January 2, 1914, and
that the plaintiff received as his due proportion four
thousand one hundred and seventy-four and a half shares.
The defendant compelled the plaintiff to pay an income
tax upon this stock as equivalent to $417,450 income in
cash. The District Court held that the stock was income

TOWNE v. EISNER.

Opinion of the Court.

within the meaning of the Income Tax of October 3, 1913,
c. 16, Section II; A, subdivisions 1 and 2; and B. 38
Stat. 114, 166, 167. It also held that the act so construed
was constitutional, whereas the declaration set up that
so far as the act purported to confer power to make this
levy it was unconstitutional and void.
The Government in the first place moves to dismiss
the case for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the
only question here is the construction of the statute not
its constitutionality. It argues that if such a stock dividend is not income within the meaning of the Constitution it is not income within the intent of the statute, and
hence that the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment is
not an immediate issue, and is important only as throwing
light on the construction of the act. But it is not necessarily true that income means the same thing in the Constitution and the act. A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought
and may vary greatly in color and content according to
the circumstances and the time in which it is used. Lamar
v. United States, 240 U. S. 60, 65. Whatever the meaning
of the Constitution, the Government had applied its
force to the plaintiff, on the assertion that the statute
authorized it to do so, before the suit was brought, and
the court below has sanctioned its course. The plaintiff
says that the statute as it is construed and administered
is unconstitutional. He is not to be defeated by the reply
that the Government does not adhere to the construction
by virtue of which alone it has taken and keeps the plaintiff's money, if this court should think that the construction would make the act unconstitutional. While it
keeps the money it opens the question whether the act
construed as it has construed it can be maintained. The
motion to dismiss is overruled. Billings v. United States,
232 U. S. 261, 276. Altman & Co. v. United States, 224
U. S. 583, 596, 597.

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

245 U. S.

The case being properly here, however, the construction of the act is open, as well as its constitutionality if
construed as the Government has construed it by its
conduct. Billings v. United States, ubi supra. Notwithstanding the thoughtful discussion that the case received
below we cannot doubt that the dividend was capital as
well for the purposes of the Income Tax Law as for distribution between tenant for life and remainderman.
What was said by this court upon the latter question is
equally true for the former. "A stock dividend really
takes nothing from the property of the corporation, and
adds nothing to the interests of the shareholders. Its
property is not diminished, and their interests are not
increased. . . . The proportional interest of each
shareholder remains the same. The only change is in
the evidence which represents that interest, the new
shares and the original shares together representing the
same proportional interest that the original shares represented before the issue of the new ones." Gibbons v.
Mahon, 136 U. S. 549, 559, 560. In short, the corporation is no poorer and the stockholder is no richer than
they were before. Logan County v. United States, 169
U. S. 255, 261. If the plaintiff gained any small advantage by the change, it certainly was not an advantage
of $417,450, the sum upon which he was taxed. It iq
alleged and admitted that he receives no more in the way
of dividends and that his old and new certificates together
are worth only what the old ones were worth before. If
the sum had been carried from surplus to capital account
without a corresponding issue of stock certificates, which
there was nothing in the nature of things to prevent, we
do not suppose that any one would contend that the
plaintiff had received an accession to his income. Presumably his certificate would have the same value as
before. Again, if certificates for $1,000 par were split up
into ten certificates each, for $100, we presume that no

one would call the new certificates income. What has
happened is that the plaintiff's old certificates have been
split up in effect and have diminished in value to the

extent of the value of the new.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA concurs in the result.

STATE OF WISCONSIN v. LANE, SECRETARY OF
THE INTERIOR.
IN EQUITY.
No. 7, Original.

Argued December 11, 1917.-Decided January 7, 1918.

The grant of sections numbered 16, for school purposes, made by § 7
of the Enabling Act of August 6, 1846, c.89, 9 Stat. 56, to the State
of Wisconsin, was not an unconditional grant in prcesenti; it was
subject to the right of Congress to make other disposition of the land
before the sections became identified by surveys finally approved,
leaving the State the right to obtain other sections by way of indemnity.
By the treaty of October 18, 1848, 9 Stat. 952, the Menominee Indians
ceded to the United States their land-holdings in Wisconsin in exchange for other lands farther west, and a sum of money; but, dissatisfied with the new lands and desiring to stay in Wisconsin, they
remained upon the ceded lands during the period of two years
allowed by the treaty, and extensions granted thereunder by the
President, until, by action of the Indian Department and pursuant
to an act of Congress appropriating money for the purpose, they were
removed in 1852 to another tract in Wisconsin, selected for their
reservation. This removal was at first referred to in the act as temporary, but the Wisconsin legislature, in 1853, assented to their remaining on the tract, and by the treaty of May 12, 1854, 10 Stat.
1064, for the purpose of acquiring the new lands as a permanent
home, the Indians relinquished the lands assigned them by the treaty
