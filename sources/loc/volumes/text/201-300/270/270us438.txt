BARNETTE v. WELLS FARGO NEVADA
NATIONAL BANK ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 149.

Submitted January 15, 1926.-Decided March 15, 1926.

1. A suit to recover land and funds in charge of a receiver of a
court of Alaska, created by laws of Congress, is removable from
a state to a federal court, under Judicial Code § 28, and § 33,
as amended August 23, 1916. P. 441.
2. Where a suit was removable on the face of the bill, and the
removal is not challenged, removal may be presumed to have been
rightly taken, although, due to omission by stipulation of the
removal papers from the transcript, the ground on which removal
was actually sought and allowed does not affirmatively appear.
P. 440.
3. Authority from a court to its receiver to appear, defend, and make
counterclaim in a suit against him in another court is equivalent
to leave to the plaintiff to bring the suit. P. 441.
4. Acts induced by duress which operate only on the mind and fall
short of physical compulsion, are not void but voidable only.
P. 444.
5. It is prerequisite to equitable relief canceling a contract that the
election to disaffirm be exercised promptly after cessation of the
duress, the degree of promptness depending largely upon the
effect of delay upon those whose rights are sought to be divested.
P. 444.
6. Unexplained delay of more than three years held fatal to suit to
set aside a deed for duress, where the defendants were lft in
ignorance of plaintiff's intention and were necessarily prejudiced.
P. 445.
298 Fed. 689, affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals
which reversed a decree of the District Court favorable

to the appellant in her suit to set aside a deed upon the
ground of duress, and for recovery of rents, etc.

Argument for Appellant.

.The case was not barred by laches. Grier v. Union Nat.

S. 121; Truebody v. Truebody, 137 Cal. 172; Wilson v.

Leflore County, 29 So. 161; Eureka Bank v. Bay, 135 Pac.
584; Jesson v. Noyes, 245 Fed. 46.
The depositors who practised the duress were the beneficiaries under the receiver's trust. They were the real
parties in interest. Ziang Sung Wan v. United States,
266 U. S. 1; Bryant v. Levy, 52 La. Ann. 1649.
Where one is fraudulently induced to do an act, he supposes that he is, in fact, doing something different from
what he has done, and whenever he becomes acquainted
with the actual facts, or when such circumstances exist
as put him upon notice, his rights spring into being. In
the case of duress, the wronged party knows exactly
what he is doing but his mind is compelled to do that
which-he would not otherwise have done. The time,
therefore, when he may assert his legal rights is dependent
upon entirely different considerations and the duress may
be regarded as continuing for a long time subsequent.
The plaintiff is neither a business man nor a lawyer, and
her case must be viewed in a very different attitude from
the case of one who is threatened with duress as against
himself alone. The duress here affected her husband and
children as well as herself. Allen v. Leflore County, 29

Packard, 98 Atl. 929; St. L. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Gorman,.
100 Pac. 647; Iron Co. v. Sherman, 20 Md. 117.
Even where there is no statute authorizing a receiver
to be sued, the true principle is, that the failure to obtain
leave to sue does not go to the jurisdiction. The rule is
one of comity and not jurisdiction. Tardy's Smith on
Receivers, § 748; High on Receivers, 4th ed., § 254a;

MR.

JUSTICE

STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The appellant brought suit in the Superior Court of
San Francisco County, California, for the surrender and
cancellation of a deed of land and to recover money received by the appellee Noyes, a receiver acting under the
appointment of an Alaska court, and deposited by him
with the appellee bank, as rents derived from the land conveyed and as proceeds of the sale of part of it. The
conveyance was made by appellant to receivers, predecessors in office of the appellee Noyes, appointed by the
District Court for the Distfict of Alaska. Relief was
sought on the ground that the conveyance had been procured by duress. The cause was removed to the United
States District Court for northern California, and trial in
that court resulted in a decree, for the plaintiff. On appeal to the Circuit Court of 'Appeals the decree was reversed on the ground that the suit was barred by laches.
298 Fed. 689. The case comes to this Court on appeal.
Jud. Code, § 241, before Act of February 13, 1925.
The jurisdiction of the District Court was not challenged in the Circuit Court of Appeals; nor is it challenged here. The petition for removal from the state
court to the District Court, and the- motion to remand
made and denied in the latter, are not shown in the record.
They were omitted from the transcript made up on appeal

Opinion of the Court.

to the Circuit Court of Appeals, because the parties had
so stipulated under Rule 75 of the Equity Rules then in
force (226 U. S. Appendix p. 23) relating to the reduction and preparation of transcripts on appeals in suits in
equity. It therefore does not affirmatively appear on
what ground the removal to the District Court was sought,
allowed and sustained. But an examination of the bill,
which is set forth in the record, shows that the purpose of
the suit was to recover land and funds then in charge of
the receiver of a court in Alaska, which was created by
laws of Congress and derived its powers and authority
from those laws. Such a suit was removable under § 28
of the Judicial Code as supplemented by the amendment
of § 33 by the Act of August 23, 1916, c. 390, 39 Stat.
532. Matarazzo v. Hustis,256 Fed. 882, 887-9; see Texas
& Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cox, 145 U. S. 593, 603; Board of
Commissioners v. Peirce, 90 Fed. 764. The alleged right
to recover grew out of transactions between the plaintiff
and the receivers within the territory of Alaska with
reference to land located in Alaska, in all of which the
receivers were acting in virtue of authority conferred on
them as officers of the Alaska court. Rouse v. Hornsby,
161 U. S. 588, 590. As all this is apparent from the face
of the bill, and as the removal is not challenged here, we
think the presumption should be indulged that the removal was rightly taken, and that the District Court had
jurisdiction.
We recognize that property in charge of a receiver is
in the custody of the court by which he was appointed and
under which he is acting, and that as .a general rule other
courts cannot entertain a suit against the receiver to recover such property, except by leave of the court of his
appointment. Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, 262 U. S.
77, 88-89, But the record shows that, shortly after this
suit was begun, the court in Alaska expressly authorized
the receiver to appear in the suit and to make defense

and present a counterclaim in it. This was the full equivalent of granting leave to bring the suit. That the order
was made shortly after, instead of before the suit was
begun, is not material. Jerome v. McCarter, 94 U. S.
734, 737; Board of Commissioners *v. Peirce, supra,
765-6. The plaintiff contended and the District Court
held that, even if there had been no such leave, the suit
could be maintained under the legislative permission given
in § 66 of the Judicial Code; but we need not consider that
question.
On January 5, 1911, the District Court for Alaska appointed receivers for the Washington-Alaska Bank, a
Nevada banking corporation engaged in business in Fairbanks, Alaska. The husband of the appellant had been
the president, director and manager of the bank from its
incorporation. In February, 1911, the appellant, then residing in Los Angeles, California, went with her husband
to Fairbanks to assist in the liquidation of the bank's
business, its assets and affairs being then in the hands of
the receivers. Six ,veeks later, after consultation with
their attorney, appellant and her husband tendered to
one of the depositors of the bank, as trustee for the unpaid depositors, a deed conveying real estate of the husband and real estate which was the separate property of
the appellant, located in Alaska. Acceptance of the deed
was ref used on the ground that by it criminal prosecution
of the husban' and enforcement of his civil liability might
be prejudiced or waived. Later a similar deed was tendered to the receivers and rejected by them for the same
reasons. Appellant and her husband then filed a verified
petition in the court in which the receivership was pending, praying that the receivers be directed to accept the
trust deed and expressing the desire to prevent the commencement of legal proceedings against them by the receivers and to pay all the depositors of the bank in. full.
The court made an order authorizing the receivers, as

BARNETTE v. WELLS FARGO NAT. BANK. 443
438

Opinion of the Court.

such, to accept the deed and administer the trusts created
by it, in connection with their duties as receivers.
The deed was executed by appellant and her husband
on March 18, 1911, and was separately acknowledged by
appellant, the certificate of acknowledgment stating that
she executed it voluntarily and that " she did not wish to
retract it." The receivers took possession of the property in Alaska; they and later their successor, the appellee, Noyes, received the rents from it and the proceeds
of sale of some of the land; and the fund now in dispute
was derived from the administration of the trust.
Within a week after executing the conveyance, appellant departed from Alaska with her husband and returned
to her residence at Los Angeles. More than three years
later, on November 16, 1914, she instituted suit in the
Alaska court against the receivers, to set aside the conveyance of her separate property on the ground that it
had been procured by duress. The case was not brought
to trial, and, after more than three years, on August 1,
1918, she consented to a non-suit, having in the meantime, on July 24, 1918, commenced the present suit.
The district court below held that appellant's conveyance had been procured by duress. This conclusion was
based on findings that, during the period of appellant's
sojourn in Alaska, in 1911, threats or," suggestions" were
made to her, (which it appears were iade by two women
depositors of the bank and by others who are unidentified,) that her children would be kidnaped and her husband and herself subjected to personal violence; that
under the circumstances these threats 5roused in her a
reasonable fear for the safety of her children, her husband
and herself, and induced the execution of the deed to the
receivers.
We turn aside from the objections pressed upon us
that the evidence was insufficient to establish duress and
that in neither pleading nor proof is it suggested that the

270 U. S.

receivers or the great majority of the creditors of the
bank were parties to or aware of the alleged duress. See
Fairbanks v. Snow, 145 Mass. 153. Nor need we consider any of the numerous defenses interposed, except the
acquiescence of appellant in her deed, and her delay in
asserting her rights, which, in the circumstances, are
decisive of the case.
Appellant's cause of action is necessarily founded upon
the assertion of the rightful and effective exercise of the
power to disaffirm her conveyance, which arose as soon as
she was relieved from the compulsion of the alleged
duress. Acts induced by duress s-ich as is here relied on,
which operates only on the mind and falls short of actual
physical compulsion, are not void in law, but are voidable
only, at the election of him whose act was induced by it.
Andrews v. Connolly, 145 Fed. 43, 46; Miller v. Davis,
52 Colo. 485, 494; Eberstein v. Willetts, 134 Ill. 101;
Fairbanksv. Snow, supra; Miller v. Lumber Co., 98 Mich.
163; Oregon & P. R. R. Co. v. Forrest, 128 N. Y. 83. If
there was duress here, appellant, as soon as she was
relieved from its operation, was in a position either to
disaffirm her conveyance or to allow it to stand undisturbed as the free and formal disposition of her rights.
If her choice was to disaffirm, it might have been evidenced by suit timply brought or by any other action
disclosing her purpose to those who would be affected.
In that situation she was subject to the requirement of
equity that an election to disaffirm and to recall the legal
consequences of an act which has operated to alter legal
rights by transferring them to others, must be exercised
promptly. Andrews v. Connolly and other cases cited,
supra, show how this requirement is applied in cases of
duress. The principle has a like application where the
right is founded on fraud. Upton, Assignee, v. Tribilcock,
91 U. S. 45, 54, 55; Wheeler v. McNeil, 101 Fed. 685;
Blank v. Aronson, 187 Fed. 241.

BARNETTE v. WELLS FARGO NAT. BANK. '445
438

Opinion of the Court.

What promptness of action a court may reasonably
exact in these circumstarices must depend in large measure upon the effect of lapse of time without such disaffirmance, upon those whose rights are sought to be
divested. The appellant formed the intention of taking
proceedings to set aside her conveyance immediately on
her return to Los Angeles, in April, 1911. This intention
remained undisclosed for more than three years until she
brought suit in the district court of Alaska in November,
1914. There is no evidence that the threats, of violence
were renewed after she left Alaska, or that they operated
to prevent the prompt exercise of her election when she
had returned to her home in Los Angeles. Her husband
was brought to trial upon criminal charges gifowing out
of his administration of the affairs of the bank, and
crininal proceedings were concluded in December,'1912,
or in 1913. During the period from April, 1911, until
November, 1914, appellant, who was represented in
Alaska by counsel and by an attorney in fact, was aware
that the receivers, and later the appellee Noyes, none of
whom was shown to have had any knowledge of the
alleged duress, were engaged in the administration of the
trust created by appellant's conveyance, under an order
of the court obtained on her petition. During that
period, she made no effort to advise the court or the receivers of the alleged duress or of her intention to disaffirm her deed.
By the provisions of the dued, the grantees were given
unrestricted power of sale of the property after November, 1914, but it was expressly provided that sales might
be made in the meantime by the united action of the
grantors and grantees, and the proceeds paid to the
grantees under the trust provisions of the deed. Appellant joined with her husband and the appellee receiver
in a sale of one of the plots of her separate property, the
conveyance being executed in her behalf by her attorney

270 U. S.

in fact and the proceeds being paid to the appellee in
November, 1911. This unexplained delay of more than
three years in exercising appellant's asserted right to disaffirm her conveyance, while the appellee and his predecessors were left in ignorance of her intention to assert
it, and her affirmative action as well, in recognizing the
validity of her deed and the authority of the appellee
under it, establish conclusively her election to allow her
conveyance to stand as the unrevoked and effective
agency for the disposition of her rights.
The case is not one which requires us to consider the
effect of mere delay in bringing suit to enforce a claim of
which appellees had notice, with the consequent opportunity to protect themselves, in some measure, from the
prejudice which would otherwise result from mere lapse
of time, as in Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, 142
U. S. 417, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Bogart, 250 U. S.,
483, relied upon by appellant. Nor have we to do with a
situation where complainant's silence did not mislead or
prejudice the defendants, as in Northern Pacific Railway
Co. v. Boyd, 228 U. S. 482, also relied upon. Here the
very existence of the appellant's right depends upon the
timely exercise of her election to disaffirm the deed.
Delay in its exercise was necessarily prejudicial to her
grantees; for they were entitled to and did rely and act
upon the authority of her deed, and their defense under
the circumstances was necessarily impeded and embarrassed by the lapse of time during the period in which
they were left in ignorance of appellant's claim.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

Court to remand the case to the state court, or this Court
should, in its discretion, order that copies of all papers
in the District Court relating to the removal be filed here,
so that we may determine whether the lower courts
have properly exercised jurisdiction. Compare order
issued February 1, 1926, in Whitney v. California.
The determination of the jurisdiction of the courts
below is one of the essential functions of this Court.
Cochran v. Montgomery County, 199 U. S. 260, 270.
"On every writ of error or appeal, the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction, first, of this court,
and then of the court from which the record comes. This
question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself,
even when not otherwise suggested, and without respect
to the relation of the parties to it." Mansfield, Coldwater
& Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382;
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. Willard, 220 U.
S. 413, 419; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. City of Parkersburg, 268 U. S. 35. The record must show affirmatively
"the fact on which jurisdiction depends. It is not sufficient that jurisdiction may be inferred argumentatively
from its averments." Brown v. Keene, 8 Pet. 112, 115;
Hanford v. Davies, 163 U. S.. 273, 279. If the jurisdictional facts appear affirmatively somewhere in the record,
the case need not be dismissed merely because the pleadings fail to show them. Robertson v. Cease, 97 U. S.
646, 648; Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, 268 U. S.
398, 400. Amendment of the pleadings to conform to the
facts shown by the record may be allowed either in the
lower courts or in this Court. Norton v. Larney, 266 U.
S. 511, 516. The record before this Court, which consists
of 742 printed pages and several unprinted documents,
includes everything which was before the Court of Appeals, but not the whole record before the District Court.

What parts were omitted does not appear. The essential
jurisdictional facts are not shown in the pleadings or
elsewhere in the record.
The record in this Court shows a bill of complaint to
have a conveyance of real estate in Alaska annulled on
the ground of duress and to have paid to the plaintiff
moneys alleged to have been deposited in the Wells Fargo
Nevada National Bank of San Francisco by one Noyes,
claiming to act as receiver of a Nevada corporation.
These funds are alleged to be the proceeds of a part of the
real estate. The complaint is entitled "Superior Court
of the State of California." The record shows next an
answer filed in the federal court for the northern district
of the State. All subsequent proceedings prior to the
appeal were had in that federal court. From these facts,
it may merely be surmised that the suit was begun in
the state court and before answer removed to the federal
court. But the record does not contain the petition for
removal, nor any of the other papers ordinarily incident
thereto. There is no reference to a removal in any order
or decree, in any opinion, in the evidence, nor in any other
paper or clerk's entry. The complaint did not allege the
citizenship of the plaintiff. An amendment to the complaint, filed in the federal court two years later, states
that the plaintiff has at all times been a citizen of California. The defendants named are the Wells Fargo Bank
and one Noyes; the latter being joined both individually and as receiver appointed "not lawfully" by an
Alaska court for a Nevada corporation. No allegation
discloses the citizenship of Noyes. It does not appear
anywhere in the record whether an ancillary receiver
of the Nevada corporation was ever appointed in
California.
A multitude of questions remain unanswered in this
state of the record. Thus, we are left to conjecture
whether all the defendants joined in the petition for re-

moval 1, and if not, by whom removal was sought 2; on
what ground removal was sought, whether that ground was
good in law and whether it was substantiated by the facts
appearing of record 3; from what court removal was
sought '; what action the court and the respective parties
took; and whether, indeed, there was a proper petition
for removal filed in time.' On this record it seems to me
that this Court is withut jurisdiction and that the lower
federal courts were also. Hegler v. Faulkner, 127 U. S.
482. As stated in West v. Aurora City, 6 Wall. 139, 142:
"It is equally fatal to the supposed right of removal
that the record presents only a fragment of a cause, unintelligible except by reference to other matters not sent
up from the State court and through explanations of
counsel."

of the courts of the United States." Ex parte Smith,

We may not assume that there was jurisdiction merely
because two lower courts have exercised it, apparently
without protest.' We may not assume that documents
omitted from the appellate record by agreement under
Equity Rule 75 showed jurisdiction. The requirement
that jurisdictional facts be affirmatively shown cannot be
dispensed with. Compare Hudson v. Parker, 156 U. S.
277, 284. We may not indulge in conjecture as to the
ground on which jurisdiction was invoked. If we were
at liberty to do so, what appears in the fragmentary
record before us would preclude our sustaining jurisdiction. Jurisdiction could not be sustained on the ground
of diversity of citizenship, because the citizenship of the
principal defendant is not disclosed. Jurisdiction could
not be sustained under § 33, Judicial Code, as amended
by the Act of August 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532, as a
civil suit against "an officer of the courts of the United
States for or on account of any act done under color of
his office or in the performance of his duties as such
officer," compare Matarazzo v. Hustis, 256 Fed. 882,
because there is nothing to show that removal was sought
upon this ground, or that the requirements of the statute
were complied with, compare Ex parte Anderson, 3 Woods
124; Rothschild v. Matthews, 22 Fed. 6, or that there was
"a causal connection between what the officer has done "
and his asserted official authority. See Maryland v.
Soper, ante, p. 9. Jurisdiction could not be sustained
on the ground that the proceeding is ancillary, because
no receiver of the Alaska bank was appointed in California, nor was its estate being administered there, Mer6It is true that, although no party can by his conduct prevent dismissal by this Court when the absence of jurisdiction is discovered,
Parker v. Ormsby, 141 U. S. 81, mere irregularity in the removal
may be waived where the suit might originally have been brought in
the federal court. Baggs v. Martin, 179 U. S. 206.

cantile Trust Co. v. Kanawha & Ohio Ry. Co., 39 Fed.

no ground for removal. Gilmore v. Herrick, 93 Fed. 525.
Compare Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608, 618-620;
Shinney v. North American Savings & Loan Bldg. Co.;

ground 'that the case is one "arising under the
laws of the United States," because the mere fact that the
defendant Noyes is the reputed receiver of a state corporation appointed by a federal court is not a ground for
removal! Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville
Ry. Co., 179 U. S. 335. The record shows no other way
in which the case arises under the laws of the United
States. There is no actual controversy as to any federal matter. Compare Niles Bement Pond Co. v. Iron
