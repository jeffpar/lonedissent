qualified resident aliens. The Act of 1906 did not introduce any change in policy. It did change, in some
respects, the qualifications. And to carry out the established policy through more effective application of the
law, it made changes in administrative and judicial machinery. That end is subserved by the correction of errors
of the trial court thiough appellate review. Neither
United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 326, nor the history
of the legislation there referred to, leads to a denial of
appellate review. In that case attention was called to the
fact that Congress had not provided in the Act of 1906
for an appeal from judgments of the state courts admitting aliens to citizenship. The question under discussion
was whether a judgment of naturalization entered by a
state court barred as res judicata a proceeding brought in
a federal court under § 15 to cancel the certificate of
naturalization.
To the questions asked in the two cases, we answer that
the Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review
by appeal the order or decree of the District Court denying the petition to be admitted to citizenship in the
United States.
Questions answered in the affirmative.

MR. JusTICE BRANDEIs delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This suit by the Minneapolis &St. Louis Railroad Company and its receiver against the Peoria & Pekin Union
Railway Company was brought on August 6, 1925, in the
federal court of southern Iowa. Its purpose is to enjoin
the defendant from refusing to switch cars for the plaintiffs, the claim being that the defendant is directed to perform this service by an order of the Interstate Commerce
Commission dated April 13, 1922. The controversy between the parties has been repeatedly before the Commission. One phase was considered by this Court in
Peoria& Pekin Union Ry.Co. v. United States, 263 U. S.
528. The case at bar presents only questions of jurisdiction and procedure.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The defendant is an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in that State. The only service
upon it was made there. Appearing specially, it objected
both to the service and to the jurisdiction of the court,
and moved that the service be quashed and the bill be
dismissed. The plaintiffs contended that, under the Act
of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, the federal
court for southern Iowa had jurisdiction and the service
was good, because the suit is one to enforce an order of
the Commission made on petition of the plaintiff company, a resident of that district. The court held, upon
final hearing, that the order was no longer in effect when
this suit was begun, and that, for this reason, it was without jurisdiction over the defendant. The decree entered
set aside the service of process and dismissed the bill for
want of jurisdiction. The case is here on direct appeal
under paragraph 4 of § 238 of the Judicial Code as amended by Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938.
The Peoria Company concedes that the order was duly
entered April 13, 1922. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R.
Co. v. Peoria& Pekin Union Ry. Co., 68 1. C. C. 412. The
Minneapolis & St. Louis concedes that, unless the order
was still in force when the bill was filed, the service was
a nullity and the court without jurisdiction over the defendants. Compare Robertson v. Railroad Labor Board,
268 U. S. 619, 622; Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252 U. S. 436. The main question for decision
is whether, on the facts to be stated, the order was in force
at the time the bill was filed.
The Commission had found that the Peoria Company
discriminated against the Minneapolis & St. Louis by imposing upon it a switching charge while certain other carriers were not required to pay any charge. By the order of
April 13, 1922, the Commission directed that the discrimination be removed. That order left the Peoria Company
free to remove the discrimination either by discontinuing

the charge complained of or by making a like charge to
the other lines. Compare United States v. Illinois Central
R. R. Co., 263 U. S. 515, 521. It elected to remove the
discrimination by making a charge to the other carriers
and filed tariffs to that end. The other carriers protested.
The new tariffs were suspended for consideration by the
Commission in a new proceeding known as Investigation
and Suspension Docket No. 1596. At the request of the
Minneapolis & St. Louis, the proceeding which it had
brought was, by order of July 10, 1922, reopened for
further hearing in this connection. On December 22,
1922, the Commission concluded that the new tariffs were
not justified; and that a still broader investigation involving additional parties must be had before just rates could
be established.
Intermediate Switching Charges at
Peoria,Ill., 77 I. C. C. 43. On that day, it eitered an
order in the original proceeding brought by the Minneapolis & St. Louis: "That the complaint in this proceeding be, and it is hereby, dismissed. ", On the same day,
it entered in the later proceeding in order that the new
tariffs be cancelled.
The Peoria Company concluded that the order dismissing the complaint in the proceeding instituted by the
Minneapolis & St. Louis had the effect of rescinding the
order of April 13, 1922, based thereon, and that its original
tariff of charges against the Minneapolis & St. Louis,
which had never been cancelled, remained in full force.
On January 4, 1923, it notified the Commission that it
would act accordingly. On January 5, 1923, the Chairman
of Division 5 of the Commission' telegraphed the Peoria
'Pursuant to paragraph 4 of § 17 of the Interstate Commerce Act
as amended, matters relating to common use of terminals and
kindred subjects are referred to Division 5. The Commissioner in
each division, senior in service, is its chairman. See Annual Report
of Interstate Commerce Commission for 1920, pp. 4, 5; United
States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., 265 U. S. 274, 281.

Company that the order of April 13, 1922, "still stands
unrescinded. " On January 8, 1923, the Commission
entered, of its own motion, pursuant to paragraph 2 of
§ 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended, an order
for a general investigation into switching charges at
Peoria. With the proceeding so ordered, it reopened and
consolidated the earlier ones. On January 18, 1923, the
Commission issued the emergency service-order requiring
the Peoria Company to continue switching which this
Court held to be void in Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co.
v. United States, 263 U. S. 528, decided January 7, 1924.
.The Minneapolis & St. Louis contends that the dismissal of its complaint on December 22, 1922, did not operate
as a rescission of the order which had been entered thereon
April 13, 1922. The argument is that the order by its
terms provided that it "shall continue in force until the
further order of the commission "; that, moreover, paragraph 2 of § 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act as
amended provides that all orders of the Commission
"shall continue in force until its further order
unless the same shall be suspended or modified or set aside
by the Commission, or be suspended or set aside by a
court of competent jurisdiction "; that no order issued in
terms rescinding the order of April 13, 1922, had ever been
entered; that by § 16a the mere reopening of the case by
the Commission did not so operate; and that, as the Commission in ordering dismissal of the complaint did not
refer to the order of April 13, 1922, the latter remained
in full force. The contention is unsound. The order of
December 22, 1922, dismissed the complaint without making any reservation. It operated, therefore, to rescind the
order of April 13, 1922, which rested on that complaint
alone. Compare Greenleaf v. Queen, 1 Pet. 138, 148-149;
Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 451;
Coleman v. Hudson River Bridge Co., 5 Blatchf. 56, 58.
The Minneapolis & St. Louis contends, also, that if the
dismissal of the complaint operated as a rescission of the

MINNEAPOLIS R. R. v. PEORIA 11Y.
580

Opinion of the Court.

order of April 13, 1922, later action of the Commission
restored it. The argument is that the telegram of January' 5, 1923, and subsequent action of the Commission
show that it was not its intention, when dismissing the
comp -int, to rescind the order; that paragraph 6 of § 16
of tht Act as amended authorized the Commission to
modify "'its orders upon such notice and in such manner
as it shall deem proper "; that the order of January 8,
1923, besides providing for the general investigation, provided that the original proceeding of the Minneapolis &
St. Louis be "reopened, consolidated with and made a
part of this investigation "; and that thereby the Commission restored the order of April 13, 1922. This contention, also, is unsound. The Commission did not at any
time before the bringing of this suit make any order which
purported either to rescind the order of dismissal of
December 22, 1922, or to restore the order of April 13,
1922, or which made any reference either to such dismissal
or to a restoration. The opinion of a commissioner, expressed in the telegram of January 5, 1923, that the order
of April 13, 1922, was in full force despite the dismissal
of the complaint was without legal significance. The
effect of the order of dismissal entered December 22, 1922,
must be determined by the terms of the order, unless and
until modified by formal action of the Commission. It
cannot be affected by what a member of the'Commission
may declare informally was intended. The order of January 8, 1923, had the effect of restoring to the docket the
original proceeding instituted by the Minneapolis & St.
Louis; but by reopening the case for further hearing, the
Commission did not indicate a purpose to restore the
order of April 13, 1922. Compare Knox County v. Harshman, 132 U. S. 14, 16, 17.
The Minneapolis & St. Louis seeks, through a motion
to remand, to avoid affirmance of the decree which must
otherwise result from overruling these contentions. This

motion, which was filed on January 7, 1926, prayed that
the case be remanded to the District Court with instructions to allow it to file a supplemental bill in the nature
of a bill of review, because of matters arising since the
filing of the record in this Court. It prayed in the alternative that this Court treat the record here as supplemented by incorporating a statement of these later occurrences. They are as follows: On November 2, 1925, tlt'
Minneapolis & St. Louis filed in the federal court for
southern Iowa a suit against the United States in which
it prayed that the order of December 22, 1922, be annulled
insofar as it operated to revoke the order of April 13,
1922. On November 10, 1925, the Commission, on its own
motion, ordered that its order of December 22, 1922, dismissing the complaint of the Minneapolis & St. Louis
"be, and it is hereby, vacated and set aside. " Still later,
following the proceeding before the Commission known as
Rates, Regulations and Practicesof Peoria& Pekin Union
Railway Company at Peoria, Ill., and Nearby Points, 93
I. C. C. 3, the examiner recommended that the original
tariff of the Peoria Company complained of by the Minneapolis & St. Louis be cancelled. The later facts alleged
could not conceivably affect the result of the case before
us. The jurisdiction of the lower court depends upon
the state of things existing at the time the suit was
brought. Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537; Anderson v.
Watt, 138 U. S. 694. The situation is wholly unlike that
in Ballardv. Searls, 130 U. S. 50, upon which the Minneapolis & St. Louis relies. The motion to remand is denied.
The Peoria Company makes this further objection. The
order of April 13, 1922, directed the removal of the discrimination to which the Minneapolis & St. Louis was
subjected, but left the Peoria Company free to select the
method of doing so. It elected to impose like switching
charges upon the other carriers and to that end filed new
tariffs. These were cancelled by the order of December

22, 1922. Thus the method to be pursued in removing
the discrimination was left at large. The Peoria Company contends that, even if the order of April 13, 1922,
be deemed to have been in force, selection and approval
of the method to be pursued in the removal of discrimination present administrative problems, and that further
action by the Commission would be required before any
court could be called upon to enforce that order. As the
District Court for southern Iowa was without jurisdiction
of this suit because that order was not in force, we need
not consider this objection.
Affirmed.

that purpose had been uniformly recognized by the commission as
pending before it and the objection was purely technical. P. 590.
