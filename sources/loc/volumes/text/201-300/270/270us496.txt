payment. It should have been confined to interest on the
principal sums. The eighth finding of the Court of Claims
shows in mere or less detail how the interest was calculated. The methods adopted we have already criticised.
The Solicitor General in his brief makes it evident that
in the case of no one of the four items is the amount which
has been actually paid less than that which should have
been paid down to the day of payment, in accordance with
the judgment, including the principal and 5 per cent.
simple interest to the date of payment. There is no
attempt on the part of the appellant to question the
demonstration of this fact. The truth is that the errors
in the calculation increased by a substantial sum the
amounts which under the judgment should have been
paid. As this was more favorable than it should have
been to the Cherokees,. they can not complain. On
this appeal, under the Act of 1919, and in compliance
with its requirement, we hold that there is no more
interest due to the Cherokees beyond that which they
have already received. The Government is not in a
position, in view of the fact that the errors referred to
have been embodied in legislation, and the overpayments
have been made by direction of Congress, to seek to
recover them back. Indeed it has not attempted to do
so. The judgment of the Court of Claims is
Affirmed.

LUCKETT v. DELPARK, INC.,

ET AL

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

No. 220.

Argued March 16, 1926.-Decided April 12, 1926.

1. A suit is within the jurisdiction of the District Court, as arising
under the patent laws, where the bill seeks an injunction against
infringement, with profits and damages, even though it contain
averments in denial of an anticipated defense of license or authority

to use the patent. Hartell v. Tilghman, 99 U. S. 547, qualified.
P. 510.
2. But where the main'purpose of the bill is to recover royalties
under a license or assignment, or damages for breach of covenants,
or for specific performance thereof, or to declare a forfeiture of
licenses or obtain a reconveyance of an assigned patent for
breach of conditions, additional averments of danger that the
patent will be infringed after the title has been so restored,
coupled with a prayer for an injunction, do not bring the case
within the federal jurisdiction. Wilson v. Sandford, 10 How. 99.

Affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree of the District Court dismissing
the bill for want of jurisdiction in a suit by Luckett, a
patent-owner, for an accounting and damages under
license agreements, for cancellation of the agreements, injunction against future infringement of the patents, etc.

Mr. Thomas J. Johnston, with whom Messrs. J. Granville Meyers and John Milton were on the brief, for
appellant.
Counsel for appellant cited: White v. Rankin, 144
U. S. 628; Healy v. Sea Gull Mfg. Co., 237 U. S. 479;
Wilson v. Sanford, 10 How. 99; Hartell v. Tilghman, 99

these cases they deduced the following propositions:
I. Where the suit is based only on a contract concerning patent (or other) rights, whether to enforce the
contract, to modify it, to cancel it, or to recover damages
for its breach, the suit is not one "touching patent rights,"
under § 256, par. 5, Judicial Code, and jurisdiction must
be maintained, if at all, by reason of diverse citizenship,

or otherwise, under §24; subject to the usual restrictions
as to residence, etc., of the concurrent jurisdiction found
in § 51. That patent rights may or must be incidentally
considered does not affect the principle.
II. Where the suit declares for infringement of letterspatent, the jurisdiction of the District Court is not only
complete, but exclusive; subject to the residence limitation of § 48.
'III. Jurisdiction once attaching is not divested by the
fact that contract questions must be decided in the adjudication on the merits.
IV. The merits have nothing to do with jurisdiction.
That depends exclusively upon the case stated by the
plaintiff.
V. Where the plaintiff pleads jurisdictional facts, an
answer interjecting a contractual defense does not divest
the jurisdiction; the court must proceed to "hear and
determine" all of the issues.
VI. Where the bill pleads patent infringement, an anticipatory negation of a contract defence will not divest
jurisdiction.

park, a corporation of New York, and against Parker, Ford
& Dick, a corporation, formerly known as the Luckett
Company, organized in the State of Maryland. Appearing for the purpose of the motion only, the defendants
filed a motion to dismiss, because the court was without
jurisdiction to entertain the bill. The certificate by the
District Court shows its dismissal on that ground, September 17, 1924. This appeal was allowed, November 24,
1924, so that it is maintainable under § 238 of the Judicial
Code, in accordance with the saving provision of § 14 of
the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 942.
Section 51 of the Judicial Code provides that where the
jurisdiction is founded on the fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suits shall be brought
only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff
or the defendant. The requisite diverse citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendants exists in this suit,
but the District of New Jersey is not the district of the
residence of either the plaintiff or the defendants. And
against defendants' objection, jurisdiction on that ground
can not be sustained.
The plaintiff asserts that jurisdiction exists as of a suit
under the patent laws under the Judicial. Code, § 24, par.
7, § 48 and § 256. Section 48 provides that "in suits for
the infringement Of letters patent, the. District Courts of
the United States shall have jurisdiction in law or in
equity in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant,
whether a person, partnership or corporation, shall have
committed acts of infringement and have a regular and
established place of business." The question in this case,
then, is whether, it being averred that the defendants regularly do business in New Jersey, and have made and sold
there the patented articles referred to in the bill, its
allegations make the suit one arising under the patent
laws.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The bill shows that two patents were issued to Luckett,
one on November 12, 1918, No. 1284391, and the other
on October 12, 1915, No. 1156301, for a method of making
undergarments known as union suits. The later patent,
No. 1284391, is averred to be the generic and the broader
invention, while the earlier patent, No. 1156301, is a specific and narrower one. After the later patent was applied for, but before it was granted, Luckett gave a nonexclusive license for manufacture and sale of the garments
under it to the Delpark corporation. This reserved to
Luckett a royalty on all garments manufactured and sold
under it, the licensee covenanting to give access to its
books of aceount. A supplementary agreement made the
license exclusive. Later, Luckett gave to the other defendant, Parker, Ford & Dick, an assignment of the Letters Patent No. 1156301, under which a particular union
suit known as the " My Pal" suit is made, with conditions
subsequent that the assignee should pay certain royalties,
should keep the accounts open for inspection, and should
push vigorously the sale of "My Pal" suits, and with a
provision that, if any condition subsequent failed, the title
to the letters patent assigned should revert to Luckett,
on his giving the assignee thirty days' notice in writing
of his election to resume title. All the contracts of license
and assignment made by' the plaintiff with each of the
defendants are attache'd to the bill as exhibits.
The averments of the bill are that Delpark, Incorporated, has acquired control of the stock of the Parker, Ford
& Dick corporation, and the defendants are acting together; that the Delpark corporation refuses to pay to
Luckett any ro3 alties due under its exclusive license of
the generic patent; that the Parker, Ford & Dick corporation refuses to pay any royalties under plaintiff's
assignment to it of the specific patent, and refuses to push
the sale of "My Pal" suits; that this refusal is to prevent
competition of the" My Pal" suits with the Delpark suits,

LUCKETT v. DELPARK.

Opinion of the Court.

and thus deprives plaintiff of royalties on the "My Pal"
suits. The nlaintiff avers that on November 27, 1918, by
notice in writing he cancelled his assignment to the
Parker, Ford & Dick coiporation, for failure of condition
subsequent, and resumed his title to Letters Patent
No. 1156301.
The seventeenth paragraph in the bill, and the only one
which uses the word "infringement," is as follows:
. "(XVII) And your orator further shows unto
your
Honors, that Delpark, Incorporated, is a large concern
with substantial capital, and ever since the issue of Letters Patent No. 1,284,391 on November 12, 1918, has been
actively engaged in the manufacture and sale of the Delpark garment so-called, which infringes the claims of the
said Letters Patent and also the claims of Letters Patent
No. 1,156,301; and that large numbers of the said garment
have been made and sold upon which royalties are now
due to your orator, the amount of which he is wholly
unable to state with definiteness, but which is far larger
than three thousand dollars, exclusive of interest and
costs; and that though often requested as hereinbefore
set out, no accounting has ever been had between your
orator and Delpark, Incorporated, or Parker, Ford &
Dick, Inc., either as to royalties due or Ps to damages for
failure to observe- the contract to exploit the 'My Pal'
garment."
The plaintiff sets out thirteen prayers f6r equitable
relief. He asks that the defendants file statements of
the garments made and sold under both patents containing retail prices at which the garments were sold, in order
to show the royalties due; also a statement of the orders
received for the "My Pal" garments but not filled, with
prices, to show the royalties lost; and that they ,e compelled to permit access to their books. of account. He
further prays that the Parker, Ford & Dick Corporation
be required to execute a formal reassignment of Letters

502

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

Patent No. 1,156,301 to the complainant so as to remove
the cloud from his title to that patent, and that an order
issue cancelling the licenses and agreements made with
both defendants. He prays for damages for suppressing
the "My Pal" garment, and the failure properly to
exploit it as agreed.
In prayer J, the plaintiff asks that a preliminary injunction issue against both defendants to prevent their
making sale or delivery of the so-called Delpark garment
or the so-called "My Pal" garment, or any other garment infringing the claims of the two letters patent of
the plaintiff, until further order of court. By prayer K,
a similar permanent injunction is asked. There is a.
prayer for an order sending the cause to a master to
take and state the account of profits and damages both
as to royaliies due and accrued, and as to damages for
suppression of the "My Pal" garment and to report the
same to the court.
We do not think that this suit arises under the .patent
laws. Its main and declared purpose is to enforce the
rights of the plaintiff under his contracts with defendants
for royalties and for pushing the sales of "My Pal" garment. In addition he seeks the reconveyance of one
patent, on forfeiture for failure of condition, to remove
a cloud on his title and a cancellation of all agreements
of license of the other, for their breach, in order presumably that, unembarrassed by, his assignment and
licenses, he may enjoin future infringement.
It is a general rule that a suit by a patentee for royalties under a license or assignment granted by him, or for
any remedy in respect of a contract permitting use of
the patent is not a suit under the patent laws of the
United States, and can not be maintained in a federal
court as such. Wilson v. Sandford, 10 How. 99; Brown v.

Nichols, Shepard & Company, 140 U. S. 344; Briggs v.
United Shoe Machinery Company, 239 U. S. 48.
In Wilson v. Sandford, supra, a bill in equity was filed
in a federal circuit court setting forth complainant's
ownership of a patent, an assignment to defendants of
a license in consideration of five promissory notes, with
a condition of reversion to complainant on failure to pay
any note. The bill averred that the first two notes were
not paid, insisted that the license was forfeited by the
failure and the licensor was fully reinvested at law and
in equity with all his original rights, that the defendants
were using the patented machine and were infringing
the patent, prayed an account of profits since forfeiture, a temporary and permanent injunction, and a reinvestiture of title in the complainant. On demurrer,
the bill was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as not arising under the patent laws. Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the Court, said:
"The rights of the parties depend altogether upon
common law and equity principles. The object of the bill
is to have the contract set aside and declared to be forfeited; and the prayer is, 'that the appellant's reinvestiture
of title to the license granted to the appellees, by reason
of the forfeiture of the contract, may be sanctioned by the
Court,' and for an injunction. But the injunction he asks
for is in consequence of the decree of the Court sanctioning the forfeiture. Hc alleges no ground for an injunction unless the contract is set aside. And if the case
made in the bill was a fit one for relief in equity, it is very
clear that whether the contract ought to be declared
forfeited or not, in a court of chancery, depended altogether upon rules and principles of equity, and in no
degree whatever upon any act of Congress concerning
patent rights."
The bill in the present case can not in any respect be
distinguished from that in Wilson v. Sandford, as this

language of the opinion shows. But counsel for the appellant here insists that a new and more liberal rule has
been adopted by this Court in later cases, and that the
time has now come for recognizing it by taking what he
calls the last step.
In the common feature of Wilson v. Sandford and the
case before us, jurisdiction fails because the complainant
in his bill seeks forfeiture of licensed rights in equity
before he can rely on the patent laws to enjoin infringement of his patent rights and obtain damages therefor.
There has been no variation from the authority and effect
of the case cited on this point. New Marshall Co. v.

Hert, 290 Fed. 876.
The cases cited as qualifying Wilson v. Sandford are
White v. Rankin, 144 U. S. 628; Excelsior Wooden Pipe
Company v. Pacific Bridge Company, 185 U. S. 282;
Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1; The Fair v. Kohler Die
Company, 228 U. S. 22; Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Company, 237 U. S. 479, and Geneva FurnitureCo. v. Karpen,
238 U. S. 254. We think that none of these cases shakes
the authority of Wilson v. Sandford upon the point here
in question, or can be used to sustain the present bill.
The case which has been "blown upon" is that of Hartell
v. Tilghman, supra,in which the opinion of the Court was
delivered by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for himself and
three other Justices, and in which Mr. Justice Bradley

LUCKETT v. DELPARK.
496

Opinion of the Court.

announced a dissenting opinion in which two others concurred. That case was a suit in equity in which the complainant set up a process patent and complained that
defendants were infringing by using the process without
license and prayed an injunction and a decree for profits
and damages. The bill further averred that negotiations
had been had between the parties looking to a license,
beginning with a verbal agreement by complainant that
he should put up machinery for use of defendants in their
shop in using the patent, and that thereafter defendants
should take a license on certain well understood conditions; that complainant under the verbal agreement put
up the machinery and was paid for it, and received royalties under it for use of the patent for some months; that
on tender of contract forrps for the license defendants
refused to sign, and that on such refusal complainant forbade defendants to use the process and brought the suit.
The majority relied on Wilson v. Sandford, and held that
the suit was not under patent laws; that complainant
could not himself rescind the verbal contract, treat it as
a nullity and charge the defendants as infringers, but must
preliminarily seek rescission in a court of equity. Mr.
Justice Bradley's view was that the plaintiff in his bill had
chosen to place himself on the infringement of his patent
as his sole ground and that by anticipation of the defense
and his answer to it in his bill, as allowed by equity pleading, he did not change its nature.
In White v. Rankin, supra, it was held that a bill in
equity for the infringement of letters patent for an invention, in the usual form, which did not mention or refer to
any contract with the defendants for the use of the patent,
could not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the
defendants in a plea set up an agreement in writing between the plaintiffs and one of the defendants to assign
to him an interest in the patent on certain conditions
which he alleged he had performed, and certain other

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

matters which it was alleged had given the defendant the
right to make, use and sell the patented invention. The
plea being overruled and the answer filed, a stipulation
in writing was entered into admitting that the defendants
had made and sold the articles containing the patented inventions, and that a certain written agreement
had been made to the purport before mentioned. The
decision of the Court was that the jurisdiction was established by the averments of the bill and that the defense
constituted.a mere issue as to the title to the patent, but
could not oust the jurisdiction which rested on the averments of the bill.
In Excelsior Wooden Pipe Company v. Pacific Bridge
Company, supra, an exclusive licensee filed a bill against
the patentee and another party to whom the patentee
had granted a conflicting license. This Court held that
the patent jurisdiction of the court was not ousted by
reason of allegations in the answer that the plaintiff had
forfeited all his rights under the license through his failure
to comply with its terms and conditions, by reason of
which the license had been revoked by the patentee.
Complainant was an exclusive licensee which sought damages for infringement of its license and the patent against
the patentee and one to whom he had granted a subsequent and conflicting license. In such a case the licensee
had the right to sue the patentee on the patent. Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205; Independent Wireless Telegraph Company v. Radio Corporation of America, 269
U. S. 459. The case was held to be a suit for infringement under the patent laws, jurisdiction in which was
not ousted because the patentee had led a third person
to infringe the patent and the first license.
In Henry v. Dick Company, supra, the patentee for a
kind of ink filed a bill for infringement against the users
of his patent, whom the bill showed to be using the ink
in connection with unpatented supplies not made by the

LUCKETT v. DELPARK.

patentee, in violation of a license from the patentee
limited to its use with its supplies. The case has been
since reversed on the merits, Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 502, but not on the point of
jurisdiction. It was objected that the suit was not a suit
under the patent laws but a suit on the license contract.
It was held that the patentee might waive the contract
and sue on the tort of infringement; that jurisdiction must
depend on the remedy it chose and sought in its bill,
and that, as the patentee had neither sued on the broken
contract of license nor asked to have it forfeited by the
court, the jurisdiction under the patent laws was not
ousted.
In The Fairv. Kohler Die & Specialty Company, supra,
the Kohler Company brought a bill in equity to enjoin
The Fair from making and vending certain devices and
selling them at less than $1.50 each, and asked an account
and triple damages. The bill alleged that plaintiff had the
sole and exclusive right to make and sell devices, and that
the defendant had full notice thereof and was selling the
same without license from the plaintiff. It alleged that
the plaintiff, when it sold, imposed the condition that the
goods should not be sold at less than $1.50, and attached
to the goods a notice to that effect, and that any sale in
violation of that condition would be an infringement.
It further averred that the defendant obtained a stock
of the devices with notice of the conditions and sold
them at $1.25 each, in infringement of the plaintiff's
right under the patent. The defendant pleaded specially
that it had purchased these devices from a jobber who
had paid full price to the plaintiff, and that there was
no question arising under the patent or other laws of the
United States, and that the court had no jurisdiction of
the case. The case came on for hearing on the plea.
This Court held that on the bill the plaintiff made a case
under the patent laws in that it set up the patent, charged

508

Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

infringement, and sought triple damages, and that in
showing later in the bill that the infringement consisted
in a sale at a less price than that which it had authorized
in an admitted license, it did not oust the court of jurisdiction, because it might appear upon further hearing of
the cause on its merits that the restriction of the license
upon which the claim of infringement was based was
not valid.
In Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Company, supra, the
bill alleged ownership of the exclusive right to make and
use box-making machines and sell boxes containing the
patented improvements. It furt.V:er alleged that the defendant was infringing the patents and would continue
to do so unless restrained. Anticipating a defense, the
plaintiff set out a license to the defendant, a breach of
its conditions and a terminatign of the same. It added
that the license contained a stipulation that, in case of any
suit for infringement, the measure of recov-ry should be
the same as the royalty agreed upon for the use of the
inventions, and another for the return of the machines
let to the defendant while the license was in force. The
bill prayed for an injunction against making, using or
selling the boxes or machines, for an account of profits
received by reason of the infringement, for triple the
damages measured as above stated, and for the surrender
of the machines. In sustaining the jurisdiction as arising
under the patent laws, the Court used these words:
"It may be that the reasoning of The Fair v. Kohler
Die & Specialty Company, 228 U. S. 22, is more consistent with that of Mr. Justice Bradley's dissent in
Hartell v. Tilghman, 99 U. S. 547, 556 (a decision since
explained and limited, White v. Rankin, 144 U. S. 628),
than with that of the majority, but it is the deliberate
judgment of the court and governs this case. As stated
there, the plaintiff is absolute master of what jurisdiction
he will appeal to; and if he goes to the District Court for

LUCKETT v. DELPARK.
496

Opinion of the Court.

infringement of a patent, unless the claim is frivolous or
a pretence, the District Court will have jurisdiction on
that ground, even though the course of the subsequent
pleadings reveals other more serious disputes. Excelsior
Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., 185 U. S. 282.
Jurisdiction generally depends upon the case made and
relief demanded by the plaintiff, and as it can not be
helped, so it can not be defeated by the replication to an
actual or anticipated defence contained in what used to
be the charging part of the bill. For the same reason it
does not matter whether the validity of the patent is admitted or denied.
"As appears from the statement of it, the plaintiffs'
case arose under the patent law. It was not affected by
the fact that the plaintiffs relied upon a contract as fixing
the mode of estimating damages or that they sought a
return of patented machines to which if there was no license they were entitled. These were incidents. The
essential features were the allegation of an infringement
and prayers for an injunction, an account of profits and
triple damages-the characteristic forms of relief granted
by the patent law. The damages were grounded on the
infringement, and the contract was relied upon only as
furnishing the mode in which they should be ascertained."
In Geneva FurnitureCo. v. Karpen, supra,the patentee
charged the defendants in his bill in equity with contributing to the infringement by wrongfully persuading the
licensees of the complainant to use the patent in circumstances not authorized by the license, second, with
wrongfully procuring such licensees to violate their licenses in particulars not bearing on the charge of infringement, and third, with refusing to perform stipulations by
which defendants agreed to assign other patents to plaintiff. Jurisdiction of the court under the patent laws which
was the sole basis of jurisdiction was sustained for the
first branch of the suit, because the claim of infringement

510

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

w; not frivolous but substantial and there was jurisdiction whether the claim ultimately was held good or bad.
The remainder of the bill was found not sustainable as
arising under the patent laws because based on contract,
and while, under the equity praztice, the parts of the bill
were properly joined, such practice must yield to a jurisdictional statute, and the bill was dismissed as to its second and third branches.
The result of these cases is, that a federal district court
is held to have jurisdiction of i suit by a patentee for an
injunction against infringement and for profits and damages, even though, in anticipation )f a defense of a license
or authority to use the patent, the complainant includes
in his bill averments intended to defeat such a defense.
If these averments do not defeat such defense, the
patentee will lose his case on the merits, but the court's
jurisdiction under the patent laws is not ousted. The
error in Hartell v. Tilghman, supra,was in denying jurisdiction under the patent laws when the patentee based his
action broadly on his patent and averment of infringement seeking injunction and damages. His averments intended to constitute a reply to the anticipated defense that
the defendant was a licensee did not change the nature of
his declared choice of a suit under the patent laws. This,
under the principle now established by the later cases,
and especially The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Company, and Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Company, is clear.
But the present qualification of the Ilartell Case does not
affect the principle laid down in Wilson v. Sandford, that
where a patentee complainant makes his suit one for recovery of royalties under a contract of license or assignment, or for damages for a breach of its covenants, or for
a specific performance thereof, or asks the aid of the Court
in declaring a forfeiture of the license or in restoring an
unclouded title to the patent, he does not give the federal
district court jurisdiction of the cause as one arising under
the patent laws. Nor may he confer it in such a case by

LUCKETT- v. DELPARK.
496

Opinion of the Court.

adding to his bill an averment that after the forfeiture
shall be declared, or the title to the patent shall be restored, he fears the defendant will infringe and therefore
asks an injunction to prevent it. That was Wilson v.
Sandford. If in that case the patentee complainant had
based his action on his patent right and had sued for infringement, and by anticipation of a defense of the assignment had alleged a forfeiture by his own declaration without seeking aid of the court, jurisdiction under the patent
laws would have attached, and he would have had to meet
the claim by the defendant that forfeiture of the license
or assignment and restoration of title could not .be had
except by a decree of a court, which if sustained, would
have defeated his prayer for an injunction on the merits.
But when the patentee exercises his choice. and bases his
action on the contract and seeks remedies thereunder, he
may not give the case a double aspect, so to speak, and
make it a patent case conditioned on his securing equitable
relief as to the contract. That is the principle settled by
Wilson v. Sanford and is still the law.
It is true that, in Mr. Justice Bradley's dissenting opinion in Hartellv. Tilghman, supra,p. 559, he says, in reference to Wilson v. Sanford, that if the question were a new
one he would think that it would not oust the jurisdiction
under the patent laws for the complainant to join in a bill
for infringement as ancillary to the relief sought an application to avoid an inequitable license. But no subsequent case has gone so far, and we are not disposed to
depart from the rule of Wilson v. Sandford, whatever
might be our conclusion if it were a new question. Moreover, the bill in this case, as we have already fully pointed
out, is really not based on threatened infringement but
on the contracts; and its reference to infringements is inadequate even to present a bill in the form suggested by
Mr. Justice Bradley.
The judgment of the District Court is
Affirmed.
