biguous. What the Government asks is not a construction
of a statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the
court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope. To supply omissions transcends the judicial function. Compare United
States v. Weitzel, 246 U. S. 533, 543; Peoria & Pekin
Union Ry. Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 528, 534, 535.
The Government calls attention to the fact that, as
early as October 24, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue made the ruling pursuant to which the tax here
in question was assessed; that on March 22, 1920, the
Attorney General sustained that ruling; that the provisions here in question were re-enacted without substantial
change in the Revenue Act of 1921, Act of November 23,
1921, ยง 800(a), c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, and the Revenue Act
of 1924, Act of June 2, 1924, ยง 500(a), c. 234, 43 Stat.
253; and that the administrative practice adopted in 1919
has been steadfastly pursued. It suggests that these facts
imply legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute. But the construction
was neither uniform, general, nor long-continued; neither
is the statute ambiguous. Such departmental construction cannot be given the force and effect of law. Com-.

Opinion of the Court.

from a judgment of the Court of Claims in
favor of the United States in a suit to recover the amount
of moneys retained by the Government from payments
made to the claimant on account of work done under a
contract which the claimant afterwards abandoned.
APPEAL

Mr. Clarence C. Calhoun, for appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, with whom
Solicitor GeneralMitchell was on the brief, for the United
States.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
On August .12, 1907, the Midland Land & Improvement
Company agreed with the United States to dredge and
dispose of 4,177,110 cubic yards of material in Newark
Bay and Passaic River at 161/4 cents per yard, payable
as the work progressed. The contract provided that the
work should be prosecuted with "faithfulness and energy" and that the rate of work "will be at least 50,000
cubic yards per month." On September 24, 1912, the
company stopped work, leaving much unperformed. In
1913, the Government declared the contract "annulled,"
and had. the uncompleted part of the work done by another contractor, who was paid 26 7/10 cents per yard.
See United States v. O'Brien, 220 U. S. 321, 328. The additional cost to the Government was $141,127.31. The
Midland contract provided that the Government would
reserve from each payment ten per cent. until half the
work was completed, and that the amount reserved might
be applied toward reimbursing it for any additional cost
resulting from the contractor's default. The sum of
$33,998.15,. which had been reserved, was so applied. In
1917, the company -brought this suit in the Court of
Claims to recover the amount. Upon elaborate finding4

of fact that court entered judgment for the United States..
58 Ct. Cls. 671. The case-is here on appeal, taken May
15, 1924, under ยง 242 of the Judicial Code.
It is contended that at the time when the Government
annulled the contract the amount of work done had
exceeded the aggregate of the monthly requirements, and,
hence, that the company was not in default. This question we have no occasion to consider. The correspondence between the parties and other facts found warranted
the conclusion that the company had abandoned the
york and refused to complete the contract. There was
thus an anticipatory breach by the company which entitled the Government to relet the uncompleted part of
the work. Compare Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 48; Dingley v. Oler, 117 U. S. 490, 503. It is also contended that
the judgment is erroneous, because it was incumbent upon
the Government to show that the uncompleted work done
under the later contract did not materially depart from
that described in the repudiated contract and that this
was not shown. See United States v. Axman, 234 U. S.
36. The lower court concluded that the uncompleted
part of the work was relet on the same specifications.
Enough appears to show that the loss to the Government
resulting from the plaintiff's repudiation of the contract
far exceeded the amount reserved.
Affirmed.
