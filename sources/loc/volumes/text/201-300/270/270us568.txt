FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND CIRCUITS.

Nos. 762, 824. Argued March 3, 1926.-Decided April 12, 1926.
1. An order of the District Court granting or denying a petition
for naturalization is a final decision within the meaning of Jud.
Code § 128. P. 575.
2. Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the federal
courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and
that remedy is pursued, there arises a " case" within the meaning
of the Constitution, Art. III, § 2, whether the subject of the
litigation be property or status. P. 576.
3. A petition for naturalization is a " case" within the meaning ot
Jud. Code § 128, and an order of the District Court denying the
petition is reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Pp.

Appeals in naturalization proceedings.
Mr. Louis Marshall, with whom Messrs. William H.
Lewis, Matthew M. Levy, and Eugene Untermyer were
on the brief, for petitioners.
A final decision of a United States district court rendered in a naturalization proceeding is appealable because such a proceeding is a "case " within the meaning
of the Judicial Code. Such a proceeding must be regarded as a "case" in the constitutional and statutory
sense of the term; otherwise our courts, from the lowest
to the highest, in passing upon hundreds of thousands of

such proceedings would have acted extrajudicially. That
would be in direct contravention of the rule laid down in
Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409; United States v. Ferreira,
13 How. 40; Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm.,

Smith v. Adams, 130 U. S. 167; In re Pacific Ry. Comm.,
32 Fed. 241.
The power to naturalize is judicial and not ministerial
or clerical and cannot be delegated. That naturalization
is a judicial proceeding is well settled. Spratt v. Spratt,
4 Pet. 393; Dolan v. United States, 133 Fed. 440; Re
Symanowsski, 168 Fed. 978; McCarthy v. Marsh, 5 N. Y.
263, Matter of Clark, 18 Barb. 444.
An order admitting an alien to citizenship has been
repeatedly declared to be a judgment of the same dignity as any other judgment of a court having jurisdiction. It is an adjudication on personal status. Spratt v.

Stark v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., 7 Cr. 420; Chas. Green's

Whenever the claim or contention of a party takes such
a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon
it, then it has become a case or controversy within the
meaning of these terms as used in the Constitution.

2 Dall. 419. A case arises under the Constitution or laws
of the United States whenever its correct decision depends
upon the right construction of either. Nashville v.
Cooper, 6 Wall. 247. A controversy as to rights claimed
under an Act of Congress falls within the third clause
of Rev. Stats., § 709, as a case wherein a title or right is
claimed under a statute of the United States. Telluride
Power Co. v. Rio Grande Ry., 175 U. S. 639. See also
Cooke v. Avery, 147 U. S. 375; Interstate Commerce
Comm. v. Brimson, 154 U. S. 447.
We call attention to a large number of instances in
which various of the circuit courts of appeals, as well as
this Court, have entertained appellate jurisdiction with
respect to judgments in naturalization proceedings where.
cases have been brought up either by the petitioner or the
United States on writ of error or by appeal. See United
States v. Lenore, 207 Fed. 865.
It was not necessary for Congress to provide in the
Naturalization Law for a direct review in order that final
decisions of a district court in naturalization proceedings
may be appealable. United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319,
is not authority for such a proposition.
Section 15 of the Naturalization Act of 1906 provides
for a method, at the suit of the Government, of cancellation of naturalization certificates illegally obtained. As
shown above, numerous appeals have been taken in such
proceedings. There is nothing in this section which expressly authorizes such appeals. Yet the right of either'
party to appeal from a final decision in such a proceeding
does not seem to be questioned. It is submitted that
there is no difference in substance between such a proceeding and the criginal proceeding for naturalization,
and if an appeal is proper in one case, it must be proper
in the other.

Argument for Petitioners.

Upon the granting or denial of his petition depend his
status and the most important civil and political rights.
If denied, he continues to be an alien; he cannot exercise the rights of citizenship; he is deprived of the protection incident to citizenship. In most States he cannot
vote or participate in the affairs of government, and in
many States he is debarred from becoming an incorporator or director of companies or the owner of real property. In many parts of the country he cannot be employed on public works; he is not permitted to practice
law however aualified he may be or to engage in various
Kinds of business as to which by statutory enactment
citizenship is made an essential qualification. He is subjected to a multitude of inconveniences and discriminatory regulations. If, therefore, he has shown himself entitled to naturalization, and that right is denied to him,
he certainly would be deprived of the most precious right
that an inhabitant of the United States can possibly
possess; and if such right can be withheld from him by
the determination of a single judge, his further deprivation of his right to review such determination would result not only in grave injustice to the individual but in a
distinct injury to the public. Moreover, it might occasion, in some sections of the country, a wholesale denial
of the right of naturalization. The only safeguard
against such a course resides in the right of appeal. In
re Fordiani, 98 Conn. 435.
That it was not considered necessary to have a specific
provision in the Act of 1906 authorizing appeals becomes
evident from a consideration of the debate in the Committee of the Whole referred to in the note on page 326
of the opinion in United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319.
Subsequent to the decision in that case, this Court, in
effect, entertained jurisdiction of an appeal like that taken
in the present cases. Ozawa v. United States, 260 U. S.

If the requirements of the statute are met, then naturalization is a right and not a favor. United States v.
Shanahan, 232 Fed. 169; United States v. Jorgenson, 241
Fed. 412; Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Pet. 393.
In a petition or proceeding for naturalization of aliens,
the court is vested with a legal, but not a personal discretion to determine whether an alien is qualified for
admission to citizenship. United States v. Hrasky, 240
Ill. 560; United States v. Kichin, 276 Fed. 818; In re

The preponderance of decisions in state and lower
federal courts is adverse to the right of appeal.
Section 128 of the Judicial Code does not extend to the
cases at bar. United States v. Dolla, 177 Fed. 101;
Muskrat v, United States, 219 U. S. 346.
Doubts certainly exist as to the "finality" of such a
decision as that here involved. Whether a decision favorable to the alien, admitting him to citizenship, is or is not
"final"
is not the question in these cases. Presumably
such a decision is final. But with regard to a decision
unfavorable to the alien, (whith is the question here involved,) different considerations arise. -His application
may have been denied, or consideration of it may have
been postponed, for some temporary reason, not going to
the merits. He may be debarred because he has not "behaved as a man of good moral character" during the five
years preceding his application. In that event, it would
seem that the action of the court in denying his application will not prevent him from applying again after the
lapse of another five years. In re Guliano, 156 Fed. 420;

Argument for the United States.

In re Argento, 159 Fed. 498; In re Centi, 217 Fed. 833;
Gassola v. Commanding Officer, 248 Fed 1001; In re
Pollock, 257 Fed. 350. There is a conflict of opinion as
to the power of a court to add to its denial of an application a clause providing that the applicant shall be" forever debarred" from again applying for citizenship. In re
Kornstein, 268 Fed. 172; State ex rel. Weisz v. District
Court, 61 Mont. 427; Marx v. United States, 276 Fed. 295.
Naturalization proceedings, it is true, have been entrusted to the courts (both state and federal) since the
beginning; and this grant of power to the judiciary is
clearly constitutional. Holmgren v. United States, 217
U. S. 509. The control of naturalization proceedings is
therefore within the legitimate scope of the judicial
power; and such proceedings may be classed as "cases and
controversies" within the meaning of the Constitution.
But the word "case," like any other word, may have one
meaning when used in the Constitution and quite another
when used in a statute. Lamar v. United States, 240 U.
S. 60. A hearing on a petition for naturalization may be
a "case" to which the constitutional power of the courts
may extend; and it may still not constitute a "case" which
is appealable under § 128 of the Judicial Code. In many
naturalization cases, it may happen that no appearance is
entered against the applicant. In re Mudarri, 176 Fed.
465. In nearly all such cases, the decision of the district
court is based largely upon a personal scrutiny of the
applicant and his witnesses, upon the manner in which
they answer the questions put to them, upon their frankness and intelligence, and upon many other such elements,
none of which can be crystallized in a bill of exceptions
or adequately weighed by any appellate tribunal.
The decisions of this Court, and the legislative history
of the Act of 1906, show that no right of appeal exists.

U. S. 9; 40 Cong. Rec. part 8, pp. 7786-7787. Congress
not merely failed to provide a remedy by appeal in
naturalization cases, but, having specifically considered
the very point, deliberately refused to make such a provision.
It is urged by opposing counsel that if there is a right
of appeal under § 15, there must also be a right of appeal
in the cases at bar. Proceedings for cancellation under
§ 15, however, axe materially different from original petitions for naturalization. Luria v. United States, 231 U. S.
9; United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319. In Ozawa v.
United States, 260 U. S. 178, the question as to jurisdiction was not raised at any stage of the case. See Webster
v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507.
The courts enumerated in § 13 of the Act of 1906 have
"exclusive jurisdiction" to naturalize aliens. The terms
of the Act are mandatory. No court save those enumerated may naturalize any aliens. Even judges of those
courts may not exercise the power at chambers or in any
place save in open court. United States v. Ginsberg, 243
U. S. 472.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases present, by certificate, the question whether
the circuit courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review
a decree or order of a federal district court denying the
petition of an alien to be admitted to citizenship in the
United States.
The existence of the jurisdiction was assumed by this
court, without discussion, in Ozawa v. United States,
260 U. S. 178. It has been exercised by the courts of
appeals in most of the circuits.' In the Fifth Circuit,
'In the following cases appellate courts entertained jurisdiction
over petitions for naturalization Without expressly considering the
existence of a right of appeal. First Circuit: Harmon v. United

jurisdiction was denied in United-States v. Dolla, 177
Fed. 101. Although the correctness of that decision was
questioned by Judge Amidon in United States v. Lenore,
207 Fed. 865, 869, and by Judge Hough in United States
v. Mulvey, 232 Fed. 513, 521-2, it has been followed in
the Third Circuit and in the Eighth.2 In the state courts
judgments granting or denying petitions for naturalization have generally
been held to be reviewable on appeal,

in all cases," except as other-

wise provided, was conferred by Act of March 3, 1891,
c. 517, § 6, 26 Stat. 826, 828, upon circuit courts of
appeals. . This provision was re-enacted in Judicial Code,
§ 128, and by Act. of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat.
936, in § 128(a). The order granting or denying a petition
for naturalization is clearly a final decision within the
meaning of that section. Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U. S. 32.
This is true, although a certificate granted may be cancelled under § 15 of the Naturalization Act, United States
v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, and a denial of the petition may
not preclude another application for naturalization. In
re Pollock, 257 Fed. 350. Compare Salinger v. Loisel,
265 U. S. 224, 230. The substantial questior is whether
a petition for naturalization is a case within the meaning
of the Courts of Appeals Act.
The function of admitting to citizenship has been conferred exclusively upon courts continuously since the
foundation of our Government. See Act of March 26,
1790, c. 3, 1 Stat. 103. The federal district courts, ambng
others, have performed that function since the Act of
January 29, 1795, c. 20, 1 Stat. 414. The constitutionality of this exercise of jurisdiction has' never been questioned. If the proceeding were not a case or controversy
within the meaning of Art. III, § 2, this delegation of
power upon the courts would have been invalid.- Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409; United States v. Ferreira, 13
How. 40; Muskrat v. Uniited States, 219 U. S. 346.
Whether a proceeding which results in a grant is a judicial
one, does not depend upon the nature of the thing
granted, but upon the nature of the proceeding which
Congress has provided for securing the grant. The United
States may create rights in individuals against itself
and provide only an administrative remedy. United
States v. Babcock, 250 U. S. 328, 331. It may provide
a legal remedy, but make resort to the courts available

TUTUN.v. UNITED STATES.

only after all administrative remedies have been exhausted.
Compare New Orleans v. Paine, 147 U. S. 261; United
States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U. S. 161; American Steel
Foundries v. Robertson, 262 U. S. 209. It may give to
the individual the option of either an administrative or
a legal remedy. Compare Clyde v. United States, 13
Wall. 38; Chorpenning v. United States, 94 U. S. 397,
399. Or it may provide only a legal remedy. Compare
Turner v. United States, 248 U. S. 354. Whenever the
law provides a remedy enforceable in the courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and that
remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning
of the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation
be property or status. A petition for naturalization is
clearly a proceeding of that character.
The petitioner's claim is one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The claim is
presented to the court in such a form that the judicial
power is capable of acting upon it. The proceeding is instituted and is conducted throughout according to the
regular course of judicial procedure. The United States
is always a possible adverse party. By § 11 of the Naturalization Act the full rights. of a litigant are expressly
reserved to it. See In re Mudarri, 176 Fed. 465. Its contentions are submitted to the court for adjudication. See
Smith v. Adams, 130 U. S. 167, 173-174. Section 9 provides that every final hearing must be held in open court;
that upon such hearing the applicant and witnesses shall
be examined under oath before the court and in its presence; and that every final order must be made under the
hand of the court and shall be entered in full upon the
record. The judgment entered, like other judgments of
a court of record, is accepted as complete evidence of its
own validity unless set aside. Campbell v. Gordon, 6

v. Bergin, 84 Fed. 140. If a certificate is procured when
the prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it
may be cancelled by suit. "It is in this respect," as stated
in Johannessen v. United States, 225 U. S. 227, 238,
" closely analogous to a pulblic grant of land (Rev. Stat.,
§ 2289, etc.,) or of the exclusive right to make, use and
vend a new and useful invention (Rev. Stat., § 4883,
etc.)."
The opportunity to become a citizen of the United
States is said to be merely a privilege and not a right.
It is true that the Constitution does not confer upon
aliens the right to naturalization. But it authorizes
Congress to establish a uniform rule therefor. Art. I,
§ 8, cl. 4. The opportunity having been conferred by the
Naturalization Act, there ;- a statutory righi in t6- %lien
to submit flis petition and evience to a court, to have
that tribunal pass upon them, and, if the requisite facts
are established, to receive the certificate. See United
States v. Shanahan,232 Fed. 169, 171. There is, of course,
no "right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are compiled with." United States v. Ginsberg,
243 U. S. 472, 475; Luria.v. United States, 231 U. S. 9,
22. The applicant for citizenship, like other suitors who
institute proceedings in a court of justice to secure the
determination of an asserted right, must allege in his
petition the fulfilment of all conditions upon the existence
of which the alleged right is made dependent; and he
must establish these allegations by competent evidence
to the satisfaction of the court. In re Bodek, 63 Fed. 813;
814, 815; In re an Alien, 7 Hill (N. Y.) 137. In passing
upon the application the court exercises judicial judgment. It does not confer or withhold a favor.
The Government contends that, at all events, a naturalization proceeding is not a case within the meaning
of the Court of Appeals Act. The same phrase may, of
course, have different meanings when used in different

connections. Lamar v. United States, 240 U. S. 60, 65.
The Constitution does not require, that a litigant be
afforded the opportunity of having every judicial decision
reviewed by an appellate court. Compare Rogers v.
Peck, 199 U. S. 425, 435. But the Court of Appeals Act
conferred upon that court appellate jurisdiction of final
decisions of the district courts "in all cases" except those
for which it provided a direct review by this Court. See
Lou Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S. 47, 57; The
Paquete Habana, 175 U. S. 677, 683-686. A denial of a
review in naturalization cases would engraft an exception
upon an otherwise universal rule. Compare Craig v.
Hecht, 263 U. S. 255, 274-276; In re Graves, 270 Fed.
181. There is nothing in that Act, which should limit
the application of the all-embracing language used.
It is argued that the Naturalization Act denies appellate jurisdiction, since § 3 declares that "exclusive jurisdiction to naturalize aliens as citizens" is conferred upon
the federal and state courts there specified, and these do
not include the circuit courts of appeals. The term "exclusive" was used in § 3 in order to withdraw the jurisdiction which minor state courts, being courts of record,
had exercised under the authority conferred by earlier
naturalization statutes. See House Dec. No. 46, 59th
Qong., 1st sess., Ser. No. 4984, pp. 18-24. The section
makes no reference to appellate proceedings. It is also
argued that Congress manifested the intention of denying
the usual method of appellate review by providing in § 15
for a bill in equity to cancel certificates of citizenship.
The remedy afforded to the Government by § 15 is narrower in scope than the review commonly afforded by
appellate courts. Moreover, there is no corresponding
provision which would afford to the applicant for citizenship an independent remedy for correcting errors committed in the district court.
Since the adoption of the Constitution, Congress has
by its legislation sought to promote the naturalization of

qualified resident aliens. The Act of 1906 did not introduce any change in policy. It did change, in some
respects, the qualifications. And to carry out the established policy through more effective application of the
law, it made changes in administrative and judicial machinery. That end is subserved by the correction of errors
of the trial court thiough appellate review. Neither
United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 326, nor the history
of the legislation there referred to, leads to a denial of
appellate review. In that case attention was called to the
fact that Congress had not provided in the Act of 1906
for an appeal from judgments of the state courts admitting aliens to citizenship. The question under discussion
was whether a judgment of naturalization entered by a
state court barred as res judicata a proceeding brought in
a federal court under § 15 to cancel the certificate of
naturalization.
To the questions asked in the two cases, we answer that
the Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review
by appeal the order or decree of the District Court denying the petition to be admitted to citizenship in the
United States.
Questions answered in the affirmative.
