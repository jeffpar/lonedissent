Affirmed.
CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 198. Argued March 8, 1926.-Decided April 12, 1926.
1. The effect as res judicata of the judgment of the Court of Claims,
as modified by this Court'(202 U. S. 101), determining the claims
of the Cherokee Nation against the United States, was waived
in so far as concerns interest, by the Act of March 3, 1919, directing a re-examination of that question and specially conferring
jurisdiction on the Court of Claims, with a right of appeal to this
Court. P.486.
2. Congress has power to waive the benefit of res judicata by allowing another trial of a claim against the United States. Id.
3. Interest can not be recovered from the United States in a suit
on contract referred by special Act to the Court of Claims, unless
the contract or the special Act expressly authorized interest.
P. 487.
4. On the amounts of principal owing them by the United States,
as determined in the case reported in 202 U. S. 101, the Cherokees
were entitled, as by stipulation, to simple interest only, at five per
cent. to date of payment. P. 487.
5. The fact that Congress failed to appropriate money, in accordance with its agreement, to pay principal amounts and accrued
simple interest due to the Cherokees on an account stated and
agreed to between them and the United States, is not a good reason for allowing interest on the interest from the time when the
payments should have been made. P. 488.
6. The provision in the sixth article of the agreement with the
Cherokees, of December 19, 1891, ratified by Act of March 3, 1893,
providing for interest at five per cent. on money to be paid them
"so long as the money . . . shall remain in the Treasury,"

Opinion of the Court.

the agreement, and not to the principal sums and interest to be
accounted as due under past treaties and laws. P. 491.
7. The provisions in the Treaty of June 19, 1866, and Rev. Stats.
§ 3659 for investing Cherokee funds in United States stocks and
paying interest are not a basis for compounding interest on the
amount expended from such funds for removal of Eastern Cherokees to Indian Territory, since, by agreement of the Cherokees
and the United States under a Senate Resolution of 1850 and
through ratification of the account stated under the agreement of
December 19, 1891, the interest was to be at five per cent. until
the debt was paid. P. 491.
8. Under the judgment rendered by this Court in 1906, 202 U. S. 101,
interest thereafter should not have been calculated on the interest
included in the judgment but only on the principal amounts, until
paid. Pp. 492, 495.
9. The provision of the Act of September 30, 1890, for paying interest at four per cent. on judgments appealed to this Court by the
United States from the Court of Claims, from the date of filing
the transcript of judgment in the Treasury Department to the
date of the mandate of affirmance, does not apply to a judgment
which itself provides for a certain rate of interest after its entry.

Nation. Cherokee Nation v. United States, 202 U. S.
101; s. c. 40 Ct. Cls. 252. The interest allowed in the
judgment was five per cent. on the four claims from the
accruing of liability to their payment. Since that judgment, and its payment in full, the Cherokee Nation has
presented to Congress the claim, that more than simple
interest was due, that the principal and interest due in
1895 should have been regarded as a lump sum, and that,
thereafter, interest on the total at five per cent. to the
time of payment should have been allowed. This, if
granted, would be an additional sum of $2,216,091.76,
with five per cent. interest from the dates of previous
credits till paid. A special Act of Congress, of March 3,
1919, 40 Stat. 1316, c. 113, provides in part as follows:
"That jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court
of Claims to hear, consider, and determine the claim of
the Cherokee Nation against the United States for interest, in addition to all other interest heretofore allowed and
paid, alleged to be owing from the United States to the
Cherokee Nation on the funds arising from the judgment
of. the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five (Fortieth Court of Claims Reports, page
two hundred and fifty-two) in favor of the Cherokee
Nation. The said court is authorized, empowered, and
directed to carefully examine all laws, treaties, or agreements, and especially the agreement between the United
States and the Cherokee Nation of December nineteeith,
eighteen hundred and ninety-one, ratified by the United
States, March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three
(Twenty-seventh Statutes at Large, page six hundred and
forty, section ten), in any manner affecting or relating
to the question of interest on said funds, as the same shall
be brought to the attention of the court by the Cherokee
Nation under this act. And if it shall be found that under
any of the said treaties, laws, or agreements interest on
one or more of the said funds, either in whole or in part,

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 479

has not been paid and is rightfully owing from the United
States to the Cherokee Nation, the court shall render final
judgment therefor against the United States and in favor
of the Cherokee Nation, either party to have the right to
appeal to the Supreme Court of the Ufiited States as in
other cases."
It is not necessary to recount the long and intricate
history of the relations between the United States and
the Cherokee Nation. It is complicated by the division
between Cherokees into the Eastern Cherokees, who
wished to become civilized and remain in the States east
of the Mississippi, and those who preferred nomadic and
hunting life in the West, and who first went to the Indian
Territory and were called the Old Settlers. Ultimately
the Eastern Cherokees were removed to the same place,
and they and the Old Settlers were united in a common
government again by the Treaty of 1846, 9 Stat. 871.
The sale and purchase and transfer of lands east and west
of the Mississippi, the distribution of these, the cost of
removal of the various bands of the Nation to Indian
Territory, and other transactions involving expense, were
the subject of discussion and dispute between the Government and the Nation and its different bands. In
avowed conformity with the Treaty of 1846, Congress
appropriated, in 1852, the sum of $724,603, "in full satisfaction and final settlement of all claims and demands
whatsoever of the Cherokee Nation against the United
States." 9 Stat. 573, c. 12. A full and final discharge
was accordingly signed by the representatives of the
Cherokee Nation, but under protest. Other claims, however, were thereafter made and paid, one of nearly
$190,000 to the Old Settlers. Then, in a case of The Old
Settlers v. United States, 27 Ct. Cls. 1, affirmed by this
Court in 148 U. S.427, a judgment for $212,376.94, with
interest from 1838 and an additional $4,100 was given
them.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

In 1889, the United States desired to buy from the
Cherokees what was known as the Cherokee Outlet, in
Oklahoma, embracing 8,000,000 acres, for settlement as
public land. Under the authority of § 14 of the Act of
March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 1005, an agreement was made
December 19, 1891, by the United States with the Cherokee Nation, by the first article of which the Cherokee
Nation agreed to convey to the United States, 8;144,682.91
acres between the 96th and 100th degrees of west longitude, south of the Kansas line, and commonly known as
the "Cherokee outlet."
The fourth article of the agreement was as follows:
"'Fourth. The United States shall, without delay,
render to the Cherokee Nation, through any agent appointed by authority of the national council, a complete
account of moneys due the Cherokee Nation under any of
the treaties ratified in the years 1817, 1819, 1825, 1828, 1833,
1835, 1836, 1846, 1866, and 1868, and any laws passed by
Congress of the United States for the purpose of carrying said treaties, or any of them, into effect; and upon
such accounting should the Cherokee Nation, by its
national council, conclude and determine that such accounting is incorrect or unjust, then the Cherokee Nation
shall have the right within twelve (12) months to enter
suit against the United States in the Court of Claims,
with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States by either party, for any alleged or declared
amount of money promised but withheld by the United
States from the Cherokee Nation, under any of said
treaties or laws, which may be claimed to be omitted from
or improperly or unjustly or illegally adjusted in said
accounting; and the Congress of the United States shall
at its next session, after such case shall be finally decided
and certified to Congress according to law, appropriate
a sufficient sum of money to pay such judgment to the
Cherokee Nation, should judgment be rendered in her

476

favor; or, if it shall be found upon such accounting that
any sum of money has been so withheld, the amount shill
be duly appropriated by Congress, payable to the Cherokee Nation upon the order of its national council, such
appropriation to be made by Congress if then in session,
and if not, then at the session immediately following such
accounting."
The Sixth Article was in part as follows:
"Sixth. ' That in addition to tle foregoing enumerated
considerations for the cession and relinquishment of title
to the lands hereinbefore provided the United States shall
pay to the Cherokee Nation, at such time and in such
manner as the Cherokee National Council shall determine,
the sum of eight million five hundred and ninety-five
thousand seven hundred and thirty-six and twelve onehundredths ($8,595,736.12) dollars in excess of the sum
of seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand three hundred and eighty-nine and forty-six one-hundredths ($728,389.46) dollars, the aggregate of amounts heretofore appropriated by Congress and charged against the lands of
the Cherokees west of the Arkansas River, and also in
excess of the amount heretofore paid by the Osage Indians
for their reservation. So long as the money or any part
of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States
after this agreement shall have become effective, such
sum so left in the Treasury of the United States shall
bear interest at the rate of five per centum. per annum,
payable semi-annually: Provided, That the United States
may at any time pay to said Cherokee Nation the whole
or any part of said sum and thereupon terminate the
obligation of the United States in respect to so much
thereof as shall be so paid and in respect to any further
interest upon the same."
On January 4, 1892, the agreement of 1891 was approved by the. Cherokee National Council. The agreement was ratified by Congress by § 10 of the Act of March
100569"-26----31

Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

3, 1893, 27 Stat. 612, 640, which appropriated $295,736,
to be immediately available and the remaining sum of
$8,300,000, it was provided, should be "payable in five
equal installments. commencing on the fourth day of
March, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and ending
on the fourth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-.
nine, said deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of
four per centum per annum, to be paid annually."
The Act further provided that the acceptance by the
Cherokee Nation of Indians of any of the money appropriated as therein set forth should be considered and
taken, and should operate, as a full and complete
relinquishment and extinguishment of all the title,
claim, and interest in and to said lands of the Cherokee
Nation.
The sum of $5,000 was appropriated by the Act to enable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, "to employ such
expert person or persons to properly render a complete
account to the Cherokee"Nation of moneys due said
Nation, as required in the fourth subdivision of Article
II of said agreement."
On May 17, 1893, a deed of cession was executed and
delivered by the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation to the United States and the first installment of the
purchase money was paid to and accepted by the Cherokee
Nation; and the United States thereupon took possession
of said lands, and thereafter disposed of the same. The
other installments were duly and seasonably paid.
In pursuance of the Act of March 3, 1893, supra, the
Secretary of the Interior promptly employed two expert
accountants, Messrs. James A. Slade and Joseph T. Bender, to prepare an account between the United States and
the Cherokee Nation, and, on April 28, 1894, they filed
it with the Secretary. The amounts due .the Cherokee
Nation were summed up as follows:

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 483
Opinion of the Court.
"Under the treaty of 1819:
"Value of three tracts of land containing 1700
acres at $1.25 per acre, to be added to the
$2, 125.00
principal of the 'school' fund ..............
(With interest from Feb. 27, 1819, to date
of payment.)
"Under treaty of 1835:
Amount paid for removal of Eastern Cherokees
to the Indian Territory, improperly charged
to treaty fund ............................. $1, 111,284.70
(With interest from June 12, 1838, to date
of payment.)
" Under treaty of 1866:
Amount received by receiver of public moneys
at Independence, Kans., never credited to
$432.28
Cherokee Nation ...........................
(With interest from Jan. 1, 1874, to date
of payment.)
" Under act of Congress March 3, 1893:
Interest on $15,000 of Choctaw funds applied
in 1863 to relief of indigent Cherokees, said
interest being improperly charged to Cherokee
$20,406.25
national fund ..............................
(With interest from July 1, 1893, to date
of restoration of the principal of the Cherokee
funds, held in trust in lieu of investments.)"

This was transmitted by the Secretary of the Interior
to the proper authorities of the Cherokee Nation, and it
was accepted by Act of the National Council approved
December 1, 1894. It was then transmitted by the Secretary to Congress, on January 7, 1895. The principal
due on said account on March 4, 1895, was $1,134,248.23,
and the interest was $3,162,279.34.
Instead of making an appropriation for this amount,
Congress on March 2, 1895, referred the report of the
Secretary of the Interior to the Attorney General, and
authorized and directed him to review the conclusions of
law reached by the Department of the Interior in the
account and report his conclusions at the next regular

270 U. S.

session. 28 Stat. 795, c. 177. The Attorney General
made his report, December 2, 1895, which differed with
the report of the Secretary of the Interior and the Slade
and Bender report, holding that, under the Treaty of
1846 and the settlement of 1852 by appropriation of
Congress, the Cherokees *.vere properly charged with the
expense of removal, and that the item 2 of $1,111,284.70
in the report was improperly charged to the' United
States. No action was taken in settlement of the matter
by Congress until July 1, 1902, when, by § 68 of the Act
of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 726, it referred the claims to the
Court of Claims, as follows:
"Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of
Claims to examine, consider, and adjudicate, with the
right of appeal tp the Supreme Court of the United States
by any party in interest feeling aggrieved at the decision
of the Court of Claims, any claim which the Cherokee
Tribe, or any band thereof, arising under treaty stipulations, may have against the United States, upon which
suit shall be instituted within two years after the approval of this act; and also to examine, consider, and
adjudicate any claim which the United States may have
against the said tribe, or any band thereof.
Under this Act, the Cherokee Nation brought suit
against the United States, claiming the whole amount
with interest, found due by the Slade and Bender account.
Thereafter the Eastern Cherokees and the Eastern and
Emigrant Cherokees each brought suit under the Act
of July 1, 1902, as amended by the Act of March 3,
1903, against the United States, each claiming the
removal fund of $1,111,284.70. The three suits were
consolidated by order of the court, and were heard,
considered, and decided together. The decree of the
Court of Claims, in conformity with its opinion and
conclusion of law entered March 20, 1905, was in part
as follows:

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 485
476

Opinion of the Court.

"It is, this 18th day of May, A. D. 1905, adjudged, ordered, and
decreed that the plaintiff, the Cherokee Nation, do have and recover of and from the United States as follows:
$2,125.00
Item 1: The sum of ............................

from Feb, 21, 1819, to date of payment.
Item 2: The sum of ............................. $1,111,284.70

from June 12, 1838, to date of payment.
$432.28
Item 3: The sum of ............................
With interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent.
from Jan. 1, 1874, to date of payment.
$20,406.25
Item 4: The sum of ............................
With interest thereon from July 1, 1893, to date of
payment."

Then followed directions as to the payment and distribution of the different items of the judgment. 40 Ct. Cls.
252, 363, 364.
The case having come to this Court on appeal, the judgment was affirmed, on April 30, 1906, with a modification,
consisting of a direction that item two, $1,111,284.70, with
interest at 5 per cent. from June 12, 1838, to date of payment, should be distributed among 'the Eastern Cherokees as individuals, whether east or west of the Mississippi, parties to the treaties of 1835-36 and 1846, and exclusive of Old Settlers.' 202 U. S.101, 130, 131. On May
28, 1906, the Court of Claims entered a decree modifying
its original decree to conform to the mandate of the Supreme Court. In attempted satisfaction of the judgment
of the Court of Claims, as modified by the Supreme Court,
and as directed by subsequent appropriation acts, there
has been paid to the Cherokee Nation the sum of
$5,158,005.54.
The .Court of Claims held in the case before us, that
the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any more interest,
and its petition was dismissed. Hence this appeal.
The first question for our consideration is the effect of
referring the issue in this case to the
the Act of 1919 in'

486

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

Court of Claims. The judgment of this Court in the suit
by the Cherokee Nation against the United States, in
April, 1906 (202 U. S. 101), already referred to, awarded
a large amount of interest. The question of interest was
considered and decided, and it is quite clear that but for
the special Act of 1919, above quoted, the question here
mooted would have been foreclosed as res judicata. In
passing the Act, Congress must have been well advised of
this, and the only possible construction therefore to be
put upon it is that Congress has therein expressed its
desire, so far as the question of interest is concerned, to
waive the effect of the judgment as res judcata, and to
direct the Court of Claims to re-examine it and determine
whether the interest therein allowed was all that should
have been allowed, or whether it should be found to be
as now claimed by the Cherokee Nation. The Solicitor
General, representing the Government, properly concedes
this to be the correct view. The power of Congress to
waive such an adjudication of course is clear. See Nock v.
United States, 2 Ct. Cls. 451; Braden v. United States,
16 Ct. Cls. 389, and United States v. Grant, 110 U. S. 225.
Compare United States v. Realty Company, 163 U. S.
427; Allen v. Smith, 173 U. S. 389, 393, 402; United
States v. Cook, 257 U. S. 523, 527; Work v. United States
ex rel. Rives, 267 U. S. 175, 181; Mitchell v. United States,
267 U. S. 341, 346.
There is nothing before us which indicates that the
present claim for a rest in the matter of interest in 1895,
was presented either to the Court of Claims or to this
Court. It is a new argument not before considered. The
argument is that the consideration for the land to be conveyed under the agreement of 1891 was not only the eight
and a half millions of dollars to be paid, but also the appropriation by Congress of money to pay the old accounts
long due, and that the failure of Congress to make the
appropriation at the time agreed required that interest

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 487
476

Opinion of the Court.

thereafter should be awarded upon the lump sum of principal and interest as of that date, in full payment of the
purchase money for the land. The claim is that the failure of Congress to make the appropriation as stipulated
in the contract became a new terminus a quo from which
the calculation of interest on everything then due and
owing must be calculated.
In taking up this argument, we should begin with the
premise, well established by the authorities, that a recovery of interest against the United States is not authorized under a special Act referring to the Court of
Claims a suit founded upon a contract with the United
States unless the contract or the act expressly authorizes
such interest. This is in accord with the general Congressional policy as shown in § 177 of the Judicial Code,
providing that "no interest shall be allowed on any claim
up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by
the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly
stipulating for the payment of interest." Tilson v. United
States, 100 U. S. 43, 46; Harvey v. United States, 113
U. S. 243, 249.
We have already held, in The Old Settlers case, supra,
and in United States v. The Cherokee Nation, supra, that
in the past financial dealings between the United States
and the Cherokee Nation on debts due from the former
to the latter, interest at five per cent. until payment was
to be allowed as if stipulated. This result followed from
a decision by the Senate of the United States acting as
umpire between the two parties in 1850. In that capacity
it adopted the following resolution:
"Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum should be
allowed upon the sums found to be due to the Eastern and
Western Cherokees respectively, from the 12th day of
June, 1838, until paid."
Thus it was that the accountants Slade and Bender
reported that interest at five per cent. until paid shoul

488

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.

Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

be allowed the Cherokees, not only on the items which
were due in 1850, but also on those which had accrued
since; and, by the ratification of their report by both
parties, interest thus calculated becomes a stipulated term
in respect of the issue before us.
It is contended, however, by counsel for the Cherokee
Nation, that the decision of this Court in 1906 so treats
the breach of the contract by the Government in failing
to make the appropriation in 1895 as to justify the claim
that it was more than a mere continuance of the failure
to pay,-that it was a new breach of a new contract,
requiring interest as upon a new default in a new debt of
the sum total of the original claim with interest added
down to 1895.
We can not ascribe such an effect to the decision referred to. The chief controversy in that case was as to
the liability of the Government at all for the removal
expenses of the Eastern Cherokees. It was argued on its
behalf, as the report of the case in the Court of Claims
shows (40 Ct. Cls. 252, 307), that Slade and Bender were'
merely accountants employed by the Government to state
the account and not to pass on the legal validity and
effect of the Treaty of 1846 and the scope of the settlement evidenced by the appropriation and the signed releases of 1852; that the Cherokees were not bound by the
report as an account stated or settled but were given full
right by the agreement of 1891 to contest its correctness
and to resort to court in respect of it; and that the Government could not be bound by such a report, in which
the accountants exceeded their authority as mere accountants and exercised their functions as if authorized to act
as arbitrators or umpires. This Court stated its adverse
conclusion on this point by quoting and approving the
language of Chief Justice Nott in the Court of Claims
(202 U. S. 101 at pp. 122, 123) as follows:
"The court does not intend to imply that when the
account of Slade and Bender came into the hands of the

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 489
476

Opinion of the Court.

Secretary of the Interior he was bound to transmit it to
the Cherokee Nation. On the contrary, the Cherokee
Nation had not agreed to be bound by the report of the
accountants and could not claim that the United States
should be. The accountants were but the instrumentality
of the United States in making out an account. When
it was placed in the Interior Department it was as much
within the discretion of the Secretary to accept and adopt
it or to remand it for alterations and corrections as a
thing could be. He was the representative of the United
States under whom the agreement had been made, and he
was the authority under which the account had been made
out, and when he transmitted it to the Cherokee Nation
his transmission was the transmission of the United States.
When the account was thus received by the Cherokee
Nation (May 21, 1894), the' twelve months' of the agreement, within which the Nation must consider it and enter
suit against the other party in the Court of Claims, began
to tun, and with the Nation's acceptance of the account
(December 1, 1894), the session of Congress at which an
appropriation should be made became fixed and certain.
The Secretary did not. recall the account; the United
States never rendered another, and the utmost authority
which Congress could have exercised, if any, was, at the
same session, or certainly within the prescribed 'twelve
months,' to have directed the Secretary to withdraw the
account and notify the Cherokee Nation that another
would be rendered. The action of the Secretary of the
interior, combined with the inaction of Congress to dire
anything to the contrary, makes this provision of the
agreement final and conclusive. The Cherokee Nation
-has parted with the land, has lost the time within which.
it might have appealed to the courts, and has lost the right
to bring the items which it regards as incorrectly or
unjustly disallowed to judicial arbitrament, and the
United States are placed in the position of having broken
and evaded the letter and spirit of their agreement."

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

All this, however, was directed to the question of the
liability of the United States to pay the principal debt.
The Court then proceeded to find the interest due as
directed in the Slade and Bender account without any
suggestion of a rest for interest in 1895, or anything other
than simple interest at five per cent. until paid.
When we consider the rule requiring an express provision of contract or statute to justify the imposition of
interest in adjudicating any claim against the United
States, we can find nothing in the circumstances of this
case to increase the interest as adjudged. The additional
interest now claimed is sought really as damages for the
delay of Congress in appropriating the sum due in 1895
as the United States.promised in the 1891 agreement.
But the rule as to interest against the United States does

so provide. The only contractual obligation here is for
simple five per cent. interest until payment.
What the appellant here seeks is compound interest,
that is interest on interest from 1895 until now. The
general rule even as between private persons is that in the
absence of a contract therefor or some statute, compound
interest is not allowed to be computed upon a debt.

legislative will, have limited the collection of simple
interest against the Government, a fortiori must com.pound interest be denied to appellant unless provision
therefor is made in the contract of 1891, or in the statute

Opinion of the Court.

of 1919 authorizing this suit; and it is to be found in
neither.
Further support for the claim of the appellant is said
to be found in the sixth article of the agreement, quoted
above, in the language, "so long as the money or any part
of it shall remain in the Treasury of the United States
after this agreement shall have become effective, such
sums so left in the Treasury of the United States shall
bear interest at rate of 5 per, cent. per annum, payable
semi-annually." It is said that this should be construed to
refer not only to the balance unpaid of the $8,595,736.12,
but also to the money on the old claims found to be due
under the agreement, because payment of the latter was
part of the consideration for the land. A careful examination of the sixth article shows that this clause referred only to the new money consideration to be paid,
and really only to the part of that which, after it fell due
and was ready for payment, should be voluntarily left in
the Treasury by the Cherokee Nation. It did not even
refer to the originally deferred payments, because those
payments were to bear only four per cent. interest. In
any view, it did not and could not refer to amounts due
on past account, because at the lne the agreement of
1891 was made they were not fixed in amount and awaited
a possible adjudication to determine them, and full treatment of them was given in article 4 of the agreement.
The sixth article did not apply to them at all.
It is further argued that the payment of compound
interest is to be supported here under the provisions of
the Treaty of June 19, 1866; 14 Stat. 799, 805, which reads
as follows:
"All funds now due the Nation, or that may hereafter
accrue from the sale of their lands by the United States as
hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in United
States registered stocks at their current value, and the
interest on all such funds shall be paid semi-annually on
the order of the Cherokee Nation."

And by § 3659 of the Revised Statutes, re-enacting
§ 2 of the Act of Congress of September 11, 1841, 5 Stat.
465, which provides:
"All funds held in trust by the United States, and the
annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty, shall be invested in stocks of the United
States, bearing a rate of interest not less than five per
centum per annum."
It is urged that the largest item, of $1,111,284.70, was
taken out of a $5,000,000 trust fund held by the United
States for the benefit of the Cherokees, and therefore that
it should be treated as if it were always in the Treasury
of the United States, held in trust for the Indians, and
as if the United States had collected the interest thereon
out of the invested stocks and had refused to pay it over
as annuities to the Indians. This claim proves too much.
It would require compound interest brought about by
annual or semi-annual rests for near a century, an amount
that the Solicitor General suggests would be equal to the
National debt. The argument is shown to be wholly
without support in the circumstance that the Cherokees
and the United States, by the resolution of the Senate
in 1850, agreed upon the interest for such debts as that
of five per cent. until paid. Moreover, the ratification by
the Cherokees of the Slade and Bender Report foreclosed
any such claim.
After the judgment was rendered, in 1906, by this
Court affirming that of the Court of Claims, the Treasury
had some difficulty in deciding how the interest was to be
calculated on the amounts declared in the judgment. We
have no doubt that the judgment should have been paid
in accordance with its exact terms, namely with simple
interest down to the time of actual payment, and that the
intervention of the judgment of 1906 made no difference
in the calculation of the interest. This is the necessary
effect of the judgment.

CHEROKEE NATION v. UNITED STATES. 493
476

Opinion of the Court.

The Treasury was troubled by the provision of September 30, 1890, 26 Stat. 504, 537, which provides as
follows:
"That hereafter it shall be the duty of the Secretary of
the Treasury to certify to Congress for appropriation only
such judgments of the Court of Claims as are not to be
appealed, or such appealed cases as shall have been decided by the Supreme Court to be due and payable. And
on judgments in favor of claimants which have been appealed by the United States and affirmed by the Supreme
Court, interest, at the rate of four per centum, shall be
allowed and paid from the date of filing the transcript of
judgment in the Treasury Department up to and including the date of the mandate of affirmance by the Supreme
Court: Provided, That in no case shall interest be allowed
after the term of the Supreme Court at which said judgment was affirmed."
It is quite clear that the statute applies where judgments against the United States bear no interest, and certainly not to one in which the judgment itself provides
for a certain rate of interest after its entry. The above
statute was framed in order to impose a penalty on the
United States for its unsuccessful effort by appeal to defeat the judgment against it. It only allows interest pending the appeal from the date of filing the transcript in
the Treasury Department to the date of the mandate of
affirmance. The Treasury Department seems to have applied this statute with respect to all the four items. of the
judgment of 1906.
By the Act of June 30, 1906, 34 Stat. 634, 664, Congress
made appropriation for the payment of the judgment of
the Court of Claims, principal and interest, as follows:
"To pay the judgment rendered by the Court of Claims
on May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in consolidated causes numbered twenty-three thousand one
hundred and ninety-nine, The Cherokee Nation versus

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

270 U. S.

The United States; numbered twenty-three thousand two
hundred and fourteen, The Eastern Cherokees versus The
United States; and numbered twenty-three thousand two
hundred and twelve, The Eastern and Emigrant Cherokees versus The United States, aggregating a principal
sum of one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand
two hundred and forty-eight dollars and twenty-three
cents, as therein set forth, with interest upon the several
items of judgment at five per centum, one million one hundred and thirty-four thousand two hundred and fortyeight dollars and twenty-three cents, together with such
additional sum as may be necessary to pay interest, as
authorized by law."
This Act was further amended by the Act of March 4,
1909, 35 Stat. 907, 938, 939, as follows:
"That the general deficiency appropriation act of June
thirtieth, nineteen hundred and six, so far as the same
provides for the payment of item two of the judgment
of the Court of Claims of May eighteenth, nineteen hundred and five, in favor of the Eastern Cherokees, shall be
construed as to carry interest on said item two up to such
time as the roll of the individual beneficiaries entitled to
share in said judgment shall be finally approved by the
Court of Claims, and for the payment of said interest a
sufficient sum is hereby appropriated."
Then by § 18 of the Act of June 30, 1919, 41 Stat. 3, 21,
Congress provided for the payment of certain interest on
items 1 and 4 of the judgment. The provision in this section as to item 1 seems to have been largely an overpaymert. That as to item 4 seems also to have involved a
considerable overpayment, though it also -included ten
years' interest due on the principal under the judgment
which by the C overnm ent's error was not embraced in the
payment under the Act of 1906.
The sum of all payments actually made under the
judgment of 1905 was as follows:

The delay in the payment of the largest item was due
to the desire to comply with the ruling of the Court of
Claims, concurred in by this Court; that the m6ney of the
large claim should be distributed to the individual members of the Eastern Cherokees according to rolls to be
made up of those individuals. 40 Ct. Cls. 332, 202 U. S.
119, 130. This is what led to the amendment of 1909.
It is quite clear that the mistake made by the Treasury,
and by Congress, too, in attempting to carry out the judgment of this Court, was in assuming, first, that 4 per cent.
should be allowed on the total of all items and interest
between the date of filing the transcript of the judgment
in the Treasury Department and the date of the mandate
of affirmance by the Supreme Court, as already pointed
out. A further mistake was made in calculating interest
at 5 per cent. after the date of affirmance by this Court
on the total of the judgment and the interest until final

payment. It should have been confined to interest on the
principal sums. The eighth finding of the Court of Claims
shows in mere or less detail how the interest was calculated. The methods adopted we have already criticised.
The Solicitor General in his brief makes it evident that
in the case of no one of the four items is the amount which
has been actually paid less than that which should have
been paid down to the day of payment, in accordance with
the judgment, including the principal and 5 per cent.
simple interest to the date of payment. There is no
attempt on the part of the appellant to question the
demonstration of this fact. The truth is that the errors
in the calculation increased by a substantial sum the
amounts which under the judgment should have been
paid. As this was more favorable than it should have
been to the Cherokees,. they can not complain. On
this appeal, under the Act of 1919, and in compliance
with its requirement, we hold that there is no more
interest due to the Cherokees beyond that which they
have already received. The Government is not in a
position, in view of the fact that the errors referred to
have been embodied in legislation, and the overpayments
have been made by direction of Congress, to seek to
recover them back. Indeed it has not attempted to do
so. The judgment of the Court of Claims is
Affirmed.
