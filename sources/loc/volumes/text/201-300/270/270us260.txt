1. Where spotting service is included in the line-haul tariff charge,
the carrier can not charge extra for it, even when done by assigning
a special engine and crew for handling the cars on a shipper's
industrial tracks to expedite delivery at a time of freight congestion
at the terminal. P. 265.
2. A contract for such special service held void, and the extra charge
under it uncollectible, both because such charge was illegal and
because such special service was an undue preference. P. 266.

Argument for Petitioners.

No obligation rests upon a carrier, under the "line!-aul" tariff rate, to furnish switching and "spotting"
service solely for the convenience of a shipper. Under
the "line-haul" tariff rate for carload shipments, and
what is spoken of as the "standard terminal rule," filed
with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the shipper is
ordinarily entitled to one placement of a car, free of further charge, upon industrial sidings or spur tracks, such
as involved here. The Los Angeles Switching Case, 234
U. S. 294; 18 1. C. C. 310. See 57 I. C. C. 677; Pittsburgh
Forge & Iron Co. v. Director General, 59 I C. C. 29;
Downey Shipbuilding Corp. v. S. F. R. T. Ry., 60 1. C. C.
543; Merchants' Shipbuilding Corp. v. P. R. R. Co., 61
I. C. C. 214.
The engine and crew, after the making of the contracL,
were under the exclusive control of the respondent and
conformable to its convenience at all times while the contract was in force. By this arrangement respondent was
enabled tb get better and more expeditious service than
would otherwise have been possible under existing conditions. The Supreme Court of Appeals, in declaring the
contract void for supposed want of consideration, necessarily held that respondent was entitled, under the tariffs, to the exclusive use of an engine and crew-which
was the precise service it received. This holding we believe to be untenable and certainly at variance with the
rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The obligation to place or "spot" cars, under the
"line-haul" tariff rate, does not contemplate the furnishing of special facilities to a shipper to meet abnormal
and unprecedented conditions. The Supreme Court of
Appeals, in its decision, evidently overlooked the consideration that, while it is the duty of a carrier under its
"line-haul" rate to once "spot" a car for a shipper, this
duty is subject to the same duty which is owed to all
other shippers at the same time, and same place, and

un(ler the same couditions; and that, consequently, it is
not the carrier's duty to furnish special facilities to
"spot " cars for a special shipper. Such a shipper, so far
as common carrier duty is concerned, must bide his time
along with all other shippers, and wait for the placement
of his cars in regular course. Moreover, since a common
carrier is only under obligation to furnish facilities adequate for normal conditions, if abnormal, and particularly if unprecedented, conditions exist, such as undoubtedly prevailed in the present case, the carrier is under
no further duty than to use such facilities as it has at
hand with such reasonable dispatch as these facilities
will afford, and this, too, with due regard to the equal
rights of all the shippers respectively. P. R. R. Co. v.
Puritan Coal Co., 237 U. S. 121. The effect of war conditions upon the obligations of carriers was considered by
the Interstate Commerce Commission in Waste Merchants Assoc. v. Director General, 57 I. C. C. 686.
The contract did not constitute an undue preferefice, or
an illegal expedited service. The contract, being one for
a mere rental of equipment, was not a common-carrier
service, and was in no wise illegal under the Interstate
Commerce Act or otherwise. 4 Elliott on Railroads, 3d
ed., § 2101, p. 463.
If the carrier "was under no statutory or common law
obligation to render the special service, there were no
reasons of public policy which forbade the rendition of
such service upon such terms as the parties might stipulate." Mr. Justice Lurton in Clough v. Grand Central
R. Co. 155 Fed. 81; Santa Pe, etc. R. Co. v. Grant Bros.
Cons. Co., 228 U. S. 177; Chicago, etc. R. Co. v. Maucher,

That the rental or letting out of equipment by carriers, for a special service as, for instance, to a circus, is
not within ordinary common-carrier duties, is recognized

M. V. R. Co. v. Crawford, 107 Miss. 355; Sager v.
Northern Pac. R. Co., 166 Fed. 526.
If the question of a preferential or expedited service is
here involved, it is believed the failure to exact payment
for the engine and crew will constitute a preference, since
respondent is thereby given a preference over other shippers during the term of this contract of a service valued
by the parties themselves at the sum of $13,298.93. C. &
A. R. Co. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155 ; Davis v. Cornwell,
supra. Preferences and discriminations, in violation of
the Acts of Congress, may as well result from acts not
within common-carrier duties or transportation service, as
otherwise. New Haven R. Co. v. I. C. C., 200 U. S. 361;
United States v. Union Stock, etc., Co., 226 U. S. 307.
The respondent was constructing embarkation facilities at Newport News for the Government, in war time,
on a contract for emergency work. The contract upon
which the suits are premised was one in which the Government was vitally interested. Certain it is that it concerned the "military traffic." It follows, then, that the
shipments handled by the leased engine were shipments
for the United States Government, of war materials in
time of a national emergency.

.Opinion of the Court.

MR. JuSrIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These actions were brought in a state court of Virginia
to recover amounts alleged to be due for the use of an
engine and crew rented or assigned by the Chesapeake &
Ohio Railway Company to Westinghouse, Church, Kerr
& Co., Inc., under a contract made in September, 1917.
The latter corporation was engaged in construction work
for the Government on premises at Newport News connected by industrial tracks with the Railway's main line.
Owing to war conditions, there was then serious congestion of traffic at Newport News, and the Railway failed
duly to perform spotting service for the company. To
remedy this condition the engine and crew were assigned
to the exclusive use of its traffic, payment to be made
therefor as prescribed in the contract. The use continued
from that date until April, 1918. The Railway sued for
tbe period prior to December 28, 1917; the Director General for that later. The defences were want of consideration and that the contract was void because it violated the
Interstate Commerce Act and a similar law of the State.
A judgment for the defendant, entered in each case by the
trial court, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals
on the ground of want of consideration. 138 Va. 647.
his Court granted writs of certiorari. 266 U. S.598. No
question under the state law is before
us.
r
The service of spotting cars was included in the line
haul charge under both interstate and state tariffs. The
Railway contends that under the tariffs no obligation
rested upon the carrier either to furnish spotting service
solely for the convenience of a shipper or to furnish -him
special facilities to meet abnormal and unprecedented
conditions; that the contract was, therefore, not without
.onsideration; and that, being for rental of equipment,
it was not for a common carrier service and, hence, a contract therefor was legal under the Interstate Commerce

Act, although no tariff provided for the charges. The
service by special engine and crew contracted for and
given was not spotting solely for the convenience of the
shipper. It was the spotting service covered by the tariff. Compare Car Spotting Charges, 34 I. C. C. 609;
Downey Shipbuilding Corp; v. Staten Island Rapid
Transit Ry. Co., 60 I. C. C. 543. It is true that abnormal
conditions may relieve a carrier from liability for failure
to perform the usual transportation services, but they do
not justify an extra charge for performing them. The
carrier is here seeking compensation in excess of the tariff rate for having performed a service covered by the
tariff. This is expressly prohibited by the Interstate
Commerce Act, Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, § 6(7),
24 Stat. 379, 381, as amended. A contract to pay this additional amount is both without consideration and illegal.
It is no answer that by virtue of the contract the shipper
secured the assurance of due performance of a transportation service which otherwise might not have been:
promptly rendered; that ordinarily rental of engine and
crew is not a common carrier service; and that such
rental may be charged without filing a tariff providing
therefor. Compare Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry.
Co. v. Maucher, 248 U. S. 359. To so assure performance
to a shipper was an undue preference. Hence the contract would be equally void for illegality on this ground.
