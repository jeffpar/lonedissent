PERRYMAN v. WOODWARD.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.

No. 277.

Argued May 12, 13, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.

The Townsite Commission of Muskogee Creek Nation Indian Territory awarded a lot to the party having the possessory right thereto
and thereafter, in 1904 the party having died in 1900, made a deed
purporting to convey the property to him. Immediately after his
death the probate court made a decree that the intestate's estate
did not exceed three hundred dollars and that it absolutely vested
in the widow who meanwhile sold the lot. In a suit brought by the
children of the intestate against the grantee of the widow held that:
The effect of the act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, § 32, 36 Stat. 855, in
regard' to deeds to -tribal lands in the Five Civilized Tribes issued
after the death of the party entitled was to make the patented lands
part of the estate of the nominal party as though the deed had issued
during his life; it did not exclude provisions of law otherwise applicable, and if the proper probate court had jurisdiction to make
the decree when made the act of 1910 simply established the validity
of the title.
In 1900, under the Act 9f May 2, 1890, c. 182, c. 31, 26 Stat. 81, § 3 of
Ch. I of Mansfield's Digest of the Laws of Arkansas providing that
where decedent's estate was less than three hundred dollars it vested
absolutely in the widow was in force, and the grantee of the widow
obtained good title whether the order of the probate court was made
before or after the purchase.
When the question is whether a particular law of Arkansas was or
was not put into effect by the act of May 2, 1890 in the Indian Territory, this court has jurisdiction to review the judgment of the state
court of Oklahoma under § 237, Jud. Code, although if such question
were not involved, the construction of the law itself would be a matter of local law and not reviewable by ihis court.
37 Oklahoma, 792, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve questions of title to land in
Muskogee Creek Nation Indian Territory awarded by
the townsite commission and the construction of the laws
of descent applicable to the property, are stated in the
opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

Mr. Joseph C. Stone for defendant in error, submitted.
MR. JusricE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit to quiet title to a parcel of land in Oklahoma brought by the children and heirs of Squire Saunders
against a purchaser of the land from his widow. The
defendant had a decree in her favor in the state court.
37 Oklahoma, 792, 799. The title of the defendant depends upon the effect of a decree of the Probate Court
made on November 16, 1900, finding that the estate of
Squire Saunders did not exceed three hundred dollars and
ordering and adjudging that the same do vest absolutely
in his widow. If valid, it is decided that this decree embraces the land in controversy. Squire Saunders having
the possessory right to the lot, which lay in the town of
Muskogee, Creek Nation, Indian Territory, it was awarded
to him.by the townsite commission. On October 22, 1900,
he died intestate. On January 26, 1904, a deed was made
by the principal Chief of the Muskogee (Creek), Nation,
approved by the Secretary of the Interior, purporting to
convey the same to him.
The act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, §32, 36 Stat. 855, 863,
provided that "where deeds to tribal lands in the Five
Civilized Tribes have been or may be issued

.

.

to

a person who had died, or who hereafter dies before the
approval of such deed, the title to the land designated
therein shall inure to and become vested in the heirs,
devisees, or assigns of such deceased grantee as if the deed
had issued to the deceased grantee during life." The intent and meaning of this statute in our opinion was to
make the patented land part of the estate of the nominal
patentee quoad hoc-the most important words being 'as
if the deed had issued to the deceased grantee during life.'
The section was not intended to exclude other provisions
of law otherwise applicable, and to give a title at all events

to the heir or other party named in the act as purchaser.
For other illustrations of heirs not taking as purchasers
under statutes see McDougal v. McKay, 237 U. S. 372;
Pigeon v. Buck, 237 U. S. 386, April 26, 1915; Mullen v.
United States, 224 U. S. 448. If the statute under which
the above-mentioned probate decree was made was in
force when the decree was passed, the later act does not
attempt to deprive it of effect, but only establishes the
validity of the Saunders title beyond a doubt. Therefore
we pass to the consideration of the earlier laws.
The act of Congress of May 2, 1890, c. 182, § 31, 26
Stat. 81, 94, adopted and extended over the Indian Territory certain general laws of Arkansas 'in force at the
close of the session of the general assembly of that State
of 1883, as published in 1884 in the volume known as
Mansfield's Digest,' &c. One of these was chapter one,
the provisions relating to administration, by § 3 of which
if the estate of the deceased does not exceed $300 the Probate Court is to make an order that the estate vest absolutely in the widow or children, as the case may be.
The state court held that this section was extended over
the Indian Territory whether it was in force in Arkansas
or not, an erroneous principle, as decided in Adkins v.
Arnold, 235 U. S. 417; but if the section was in force in
Arkansas the decision may be right in its result. Whether
the section was in force is the main question in the case,
and as this is, in effect, a question whether the act of Congress adopted it, it may, without much stretching, be
regarded as open to review in this court, although if it
were one degree more remote and concerned the construction of an Arkansas act admitted to be in force it would
be treated as involving only a local law. See Shulthis v.
McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 571; United States v. Pridgeon,
153 U. S. 48, 53, 54.
The constitution of 1874 (Art. 9, § 6), gives the occupation of the homestead of the deceased to his widow for

life. (The minor children take half during minority, but
there were no minor children in this case.) This section
was held to be paramount, so far as it goes, in Winters v.
Davis, 51 Arkansas, 335. But neither the constitution of
Arkansas nor the chapter of Mansfield's Digest (75),
dealing with the devolution of homesteads was put in
force in the Indian Territory, so we are concerned only
with § 3 of Chapter 1 of the adopted laws. So far as it
bears upon the present case we see no reason to doubt
that it was in force, its displacement as to homesteads not
being material here. If it was in force, it does not matter
that the defendant purchased from the widow in 1900,
before the decree of the Probate Court was made. There
was nothing in the acts of Congress to prevent it and no
reason appears why the widow's title may not have
enured to her grantee as held by the Supreme Court Commission; but that does not concern the plaintiffs if the
widow got a good title as against them.
The Master to whom the case was referred to take the
proof and report his findings of fact and conclusions of
law was of opinion that the widow's interest 'was purely
that of dower' and excluded the decree of the Probate
Court. But he attached it to his report and the decree
was considered by the courts, as we have indicated. The
plaintiffs contend that thereby they have been prevented
from introducing evidence to control the effect of the alleged decree. This is a matter of local practice that does
not concern us. It was disposed of by the courts of the
State.
Decree affirmed.
