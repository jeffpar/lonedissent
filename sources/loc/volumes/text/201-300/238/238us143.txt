Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY OF THE
UNITED STATES v. COMMONWEALTH OF
PENNSYLVANIA.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF DAUPHIN
COUNTY, STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 263. Argued May 5, 6, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.
A State may tax life insurance companies upon business done within the
State and measure the tax upon the premiums on policies of residents
of the State; and, in estimating the amount of premiums, those paid
by residents to foreign insurance companies outside of the State may
be included without depriving such companies of their property
without due process of law.
Taxation has to be determined by general principles.
The Pennsylvania Act of 1895, levying a tax of two per cent. on gross
premiums, of life insurance companies received for business done
within the State, does not amount to taxing property beyond its
jurisdiction as to the premiums paid directly to a corporation outside
of the State. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194, distinguished.
239 Pa. St. 288, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of a

statute of Pennsylvania taxing the gross premiums on life
insurance policies issued within the State, are stated in
the opinion.

Mr. Charles W. Pierson and Mr. Win. S. Snyder, with
whom Mr. Thomas DeWitt Cuyler was on the brief, for
plaintiff in error:

The assumption by a state court of a fact not in evidence as a basis for decision is a denial of due process of
law.
The tax sought to be collected is a property tax, and as
such cannot be collected.

Counsel for Defendant in Error.

The construction given to the act of 1895 deprives, the
society of its property without due process of law.
A State may not impose on a foreign corporation seeking to ente its borders such conditions as deprive it of
rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.
In support of these contentions, see Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U. S. 436; Atchison &c. Ry. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280; Atlantic & Pac.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United
States, the plaintiff in error, does business in Pennsylvania.
By an act of June 28, 1895, that State levies an annual
tax of two per cent. upon the gross premiums of every
character received from business done within the State
during the preceding year. The Company paid large
taxes under this act, but appealed to the state courts
from charges made by the State Accounting Officer in
respect of premiums for the years 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909
and 1910, paid to the Company outside the State by residents of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court sustained the
charge. 239 Pa. St. 288. The whole discussion there was
whether these items fell within the statute. On that point
of course the decision of the state court is final, and as the
Company is a foreign corporation and this is held to be
a tax for the privilege of doing business in the State, it is
obvious that the scope of the question before us is narrow,
being only whether the statute as construed deprives the
Company of its property without due process of law,
contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, as alleged. It is
true that the plaintiff in error suggests a further infraction
of that amendment in an assumption by the Supreme
Court of an unproved fact: that the beneficiaries of the
policies lived in Pennsylvania. But it is enough to answer
that we understand the decision when it uses the word
beneficiaries to mean parties t the contracts, the insured,
and that the assumption was warranted by the record as
to them.
The grounds for the only argument open are that a
State cannot tax property beyond its jurisdiction, Union
Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194; that it cannot
effect that result indirectly by making the payment a
condition of the right to do local business, Western Union
Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1; Pullman Co. v.
VOL. CCXXXVIii-1O

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

Kansas, 216 U. S. 56; Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph
Co., 216 U. S. 146; and that as it could not prohibit the
contracts it cannot impose the tax. Allgeyer v. Louisiana,
165 U. S. 578. In aid of the effort to make the foregoing
decisions applicable it is argued that this is a property
tax. But, as we have said, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania speaks of it as a tax for the privilege of doing
business within the Commonwealth, and whether the
statement is a construction of the act or not we agree with
it so far at least as to assume that if that characterization
is necessary to sustain the tax, the Legislature meant to
avail itself of any power appropriate to that end.
Without going into any preliminary matters that might
be debated it is enough for us to say that we agree with
the Supreme Court of. the State in its line of reasoning;
applying it to the claim of constitutional rights which that
court did not discuss. The question is not what is doing
business within a State in such a sense as to lay a foundation for service of process there. It being established that
the relation of the foreign company to domestic policy
holders constituted doing business within the meaning of
the statute, the question is whether the Company may
be taxed in respect of it,, in this way, whatever it may be
called. We are dealing with a corporation that has subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the State; there is no
question that the State has a right to tax it and the only
doubt is whether. it may take this item into account in
fixing the figure of the tax. Obviously the limit in that
regard is a different matter from the inquiry whether the
residence of a policy holder would of itself give jurisdiction
oyer the Company. The argument of the state court is
that the Company is protecting its insured in Pennsylvania
equally whether they pay their premiums to the Company's agent in Philadelphia or by mail or in person to
another in New York.
These are policies of life insurance and according to the

statement of the plaintiff in error are kept alive and renewed to residents of Pennsylvania by payments from
year to year. The fact that the State could not prevent
the contracts, sd far as that may be true, has little bearing
upon its right to consider the benefit thus annually extended into Pennsylvania in measuring the value of the
privileges that it does grant. We may add that the State
profits the Company equally by protecting the lives insured, wherever the premiums are paid. The tax is a tax
upon a privilege actually used. The only question concerns the mode of measuring the tax. Flint v. Stone Tracy
Co., 220 U. S. 107, 162, 163. As to that a certain latitude
must be allowed. It is obvious that many incidents of the
contract are likely to be attended to in Pennsylvania,
such as payment of dividends when received in cash,
sending an adjuster into the State in case of dispute, or
making proof of death. 'See Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co.
v. Spraley, 172 U. S. 602, 611; Pennsylvania Lumbermen's
Mut. FireIns. Co. v. Meyer, 197 U. S. 407, 415. It is not
unnatural to take the policy holders residing in the State
as a measure without going into nicer if not impracticable
details. Taxation has to be determined by general principles, and it seems to us impossible to say that the rule
adopted in Pennsylvania goes beyond what the Constitution allows.
Judgment affirmed.
