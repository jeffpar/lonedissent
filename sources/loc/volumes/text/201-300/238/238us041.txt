observed in addresses. Schedules are defective if they do
not contain the addresses of creditors, stating street and

number, in case the creditors reside in large cities, or
unless the schedules show that after diligent effort no
better addresses can be obtained. If the residence cannot
be ascertained, that fact must be stated, and the proper
practice requires that the bankrupt shall state what efforts he has made to ascertain the residence." Collier
on Bankruptcy, 9th ed., p. 234. To the same effect is
1 Loveland on Bankruptcy, 4th ed. 374.
It seems to me that in this case there is an utter lack of
that diligence to ascertain and state the residence of the
creditor which is required to give the discharge the effect
of barring this claim.
Indianapolis is a large city. The imperfectly addressed
notice never reached Ferger. Moreover Kreitlein had
probable knowledge of Ferger's true address or might have
obtained it by the exercise of due diligence. In my opinion
the judgment of the Indiana court should be affirmed.

MALLINCKRODT CHEMICAL WORKS v. STATE
OF MISSOURI, AT THE RELATION OF JONES,
CIRCUIT ATTORNEY OF CITY OF ST: LOUIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MISSOURI.
No. 187.

Argued March 10, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.

If it appears from the opinion of the trial court, that the question of equal
protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment, was treated as sufficiently raised and specifically dealt with adversely to plaintiff in error,
jurisdiction is conferred on this court under § 237, Judicial Code,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Statement of the Uase.

238 U. S.

Any one seeking to set aside a state statute as repugnant to the Federal
Constitution, must show that he is within the class with respect to
whom the act is unconstitutional and that the alleged unconstitu.tional features injure him. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232
U. S. 531.
This court will not pass upon the definition of disputed terms in a state
statute where that point is not of consequence to plaintiff in error,
as in a case where refusal to file a prescribed statement, was based
on the general theory that no statement of any kind need be made
and not upon the ground of ambiguity of any of the terms used. So
held as to the expression "trust certificates" in § 10322, Missouri
Rev. Stat. 1909.
In advance of any construction of a statute by the courts of the enacting State, this court assumes that those courts will give the act such
a construction as will render it consistent with constitutional limitations. Bechtel v. Wilson, 204 U. S. 36.
Objections to the constitutionality of a state statute requiring the filing
of an affidavit on thd ground that the prescribed form, in the statute
is not exactly adapted to every corporation and that the state officers
have construed the statute as not permitting any alterations, are too
frivolous to need serious attention. In this case neither the statute
nor official caution reasonably admits of the construction contended
for.
While classification must be reasonable and corporations may not be
arbitrarily selected for subjection to a burden to which individuals
would as appropriately be subject, there is a reasonable basis for
classifying corporations on account of their peculiar attributes
in regard to participation in prohibited trusts and combinations.
Section 10322, Missouri Rev. Stat. 1909, requiring officers of corporations to annually file with the Secretary of State, an affidavit in form
as prescribed in the statute setting forth the non-participation of the
corporation in any pool, trust, agreement or combination under
penalty of forfeiture of charter or right to do business in the State
is not unconstitutional as depriving the corporation of its property
without due process of law or as denying them equal protection of
the law on account of any reason involved in this case.
249 Missouri, 702, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
Fourteenth Amendment of a statute of Missouri requiring corporations to file annually an affidavit of non-

Argument for Plaintiff in !rror.

participation in trusts and combinations, are stated in
the opinion.
Mr. Shepard Barclag, with whom MT. S. Mayner Wallace and Mr. William R. Orthwein were on the brief, for
plaintiff in error:
The requirement as to trust certificates is not due
process.
The requirement as to date of incorporation is impossible of compliance, and hence is not due process.
The requirement of venue and jurat in "County," when
defendant is not domiciled in any county, is not due
process.
An unfounded discrimination by presumption of guilt
against persons managing corporations -while other individuals and partnerships, in like business, and like circumstances, are exempt therefrom amounts to denial of due
process of law.

Armour v. Lacy, 200 U. S. 226, 236.
Whether a state statute is repugnant to the state constitution, does not present a Federal question; the decision
of such question belongs wholly to the state court, and its
decision is binding on this court. Re Kemmler, 136 U. S.

courts and presents no Federal question. This court will

Before a state statute will be annulled by this court as
arbitrary or unreasonable and, therefore, in violation of
the Federal Constitution, or of the amendments thereto, it
must clearly appear to be in violation thereof. Carroll v.

The State has extremely wide latitude and great power
in providing classes which may be subject to legislative
enactment, regulation or control, and discretion, when
exercised by a State in such matters, will be enforced unless the enforcement thereof would be extremely unjust
and clearly in violation of some provision of the Federal
Constitution. Such classification may, within certain
degrees, discriminate to great length and still be valid
under the Federal Constitution. InternationalHarvester

then the judgment must be affirmed by this court. Berea

A constitutional question which may have been raised
by demurrer or answer, and not so raised, but presented to
the lower court for the first time by motion in arrest is
raised out of time and does not confer jurisdiction on the
Supreme Court. Dubowsky v. Binggeli, 258 Missouri, 197,
202; Howell v. Sherwood, 242 Missouri, 513.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This was an action brought by the State of Missouri,
at the relation of the Circuit Attorney of the City of St.
Louis, against the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (a
Missouri corporation), to forfeit its charter for failure of
its officers to file with the Secretary of State in the year
1910 the affidavit prescribed by § 10322, Missouri Rev.
Stat. 1909, setting forth the non-participation of defendant
in any pool, trust, agreement, combination, etc. The
Supreme Court of 'the State affirmed a judgment of forfeiture (249' Missouri, 702), and the case is brought here

MALLINCKRODT WORKS v. ST. LOUIS.
238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

upon the contention that the statute as thus enforced is
repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it denies to defendant and its managing officers the equal protection
of the laws and deprives them of property without due
process of law.
There is a motion to dismiss, based upon the ground
that the Federal questions here set up were not raised
in the trial court, or in the Supreme Court of the State,
with sufficient definiteness to comply with § 237, Jud. Code
(Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1156.) It
appears, however, from the opinion of the Supreme Court
(249 Missouri, 704 (8), 733), that the question of equal
protection under the Fourteenth Amendment was treated
as being sufficiently raised, and was specifically dealt
with and ruled against plaintiff in error. This is sufficient
to confer jurisdiction upon this court, and the motion to
dismiss must be denied. Nor. Car. R. R. v. Zachary,

entered into any such pool, trust, conspiracy or combination mentioned in the first article."
It appears that on or about July 1,,.1910, the Secretary
of State, in obedience to the requirements of § 10322,
addressed to the president of plaintiff in error a proper
letter of inquiry, requiring an answer under oath, and inclosing the form of affidavit prescribed by that section,
and that the corporation willfully failed and refused to
make answer by filing or causing to be filed the affidavit.
Proof of these facts was held sufficient to sustain the judgment of forfeiture.
Assuming, without deciding, that all of the grounds
upon which the validity of § 10322 is here attacked were
properly saved in the state courts, we will discuss them in
their order.
(1) It is insisted that the statute is repugnant to the
"due process" clause, in that it requires an oath of the
corporation's officer that the corporation "has not issued
and does not own any trust certificates," without explaining or defining the term "trust certificates," or otherwise indicating the meaning of the requirement or limiting
it to such certificates as are declared unlawful by the
statute. It is very plain, however, that the term "trust
certificates" in the prescribed affidavit must be construed
in the light of § 10306, found in Art. I of the same chapter,
which declares:
"It shall not be lawful for any corporation to issue or
to own trust certificates, or for any corporation, agent,
officer or employ6, or the directors or stockholders of
any corporation, to enter into any combination, contract
or agreement with any person or persons, corporation or
corporations, or with any stockholder or director thereof,
the purpose and effect of which combination, contract or
agreement shall be to place the management or control
of such combination or combinations, or the manufactured
product thereof, in the hands of any trustee or trustees,

with the intent to limit or fix the price or lessen the production and sale of any article of commerce, use or consumption, or to prevent, restrict or diminish the manufacture or output of any such article. (Laws 1907, p. 377.)"
The evident purpose of that part.'of the affidavit to
which the present criticism relates is to require an assurance under the oath of a responsible officer of the corporation that the provisions of § 10306 have not been
violated.
The Century Dictionary gives as a specific definition
of the commercial term "trust" the following: "An organization for the control of several corporations under
one direction by the device of a transfer by the stockholders in each corporation of at least a majority of the
stock to a central committee or board of trustees, who
issue in return to such stockholders respectively certificates
showing in effect that, although they have parted with
their stock and the consequent voting power, they are
still entitled to dividends or to share in the profits-the
object being to enable the trustees to elect directors in
all the corporations, to control and suspend at pleasure
the work of any, and thus to economize expenses, regulate
production, and defeat competition. In a looser sense the
term is applied to any combination of establishments
in the same line of business for securing the same ends
by holding the individual interests of each subservient
to a common authority for the common interests of all."
We need not adopt this or any other precise definition
of the disputed term, for if the legislative meaning be
doubtful in this respect there is nothing in the record
to show that this is of the least consequence to plaintiff
in error. From the undisputed evidence it appears that
the refusal to file the affidavit was based upon the general
theory that the corporation was not obliged to make any
such disclosure as is required by § 10322, and not upon the
ground of any ambiguity respecting the term "trust cer-

tificate." As has been often pointed out, one who seeks
to set aside a state statute as repugnant to the Federal
Constitution must show that he is within the class with
respect to whom the act is unconstitutional, and that the
alleged unconstitutional feature injures him. Plymouth
Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531, 544, and cases
cited.
And it is to be assumed, in the absence of any construction of the statute by the courts of the State, that
those courts will adopt such a construction as will render
the enactment consistent with constitutional limitations.
Bachtel v. Wilson, 204 U. S.36, 40.
The present case is altogether different from International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U. S. 216, and
Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U. S. 634, for there the local
statutes had already been construed by the highest court
of the State, and, so construed, were held by this court to
prescribe no standard of conduct that it was possible to
know, and to violate the fundamental principles of justice
embraced in the conception of due process of law in compelling men on peril of indictment to guess what their
goods would have brought under other conditions not
ascertainable.
(2) It is said that § 10322, as applied to plaintiff in
error, is inconsistent with due process of law because it
prescribes "an inflexible and immutable form of affidavit,"
and that the form transmitted to plaintiff in error was
accompanied with official instructions that it "will not
be accepted if any changes or erasures are made in the
form;" and that the statutory form includes in the jurat
the year "19-,," and hence is not applicable to corporations organized, as plaintiff in error was, prior to the year
1900. The objection hardly merits serious treatment.
It might as well be said that the blanks in the affidavit
could not be filled up without departing from the form
prescribed by the legislature. Of course, neither the stat-

ute nor the official caution reasonably admits of any
such construction.
(3) A similar contention is based upon the circumstance that the prescribed form of affidavit "has a venue
and jurat in a county," whereas plaintiff in error is located
and transacts business in the City of St. Louis, which
under the constitution and laws of Missouri is not part
of any county. This is sufficiently answered by what
we have just said; but we may add that, as pointed out in
the opinion of the Missouri Supreme Court (249 Missouri,
732), § 8057, Rev. Stat. 1909, which prescribes rules for
the construction of statutes, provides that "whenever
the word 'county' is used in any law, general in its character to the whole State, the same shall be construed to
include the City of St. Louis, unless such construction
be inconsistent with the evident intent of such law, or of
some law specially applicable to such city."
(4) It is insisted that to require an affidavit of innocence
by the managing officers of corporations is an unjust
discrimination against them, and hence repugnant to
the "equal protection" provision, because individuals,
partnerships, and associations of individuals, although
equally within the law against monopolies (§§ 10299,
10303) are not required to make similar exculpatory
affidavits. The question is whether, for the purpose of
such a disclosure as is required by § 10322, corporations
may be placed in one class and individuals in another.
The answer is not at all difficult. Of course, corporations
may not arbitrarily be selected in order to be subjected
to a burden to which individuals would as appropriately
be subject. Classification must be reasonable; that is to
say, it must be based upon some real and substantial distinction having a just relation to the legislative object
in view. But here, as in other questions of alleged conflict
with constitutional requirements, every reasonable intendment is in favor of the validity of the legislation

under attack. Corporations, unlike individuals, derive
their very right to exist from the laws of the State; they
have perpetual succession; and they act only by agents,
and often under circumstances where the agency is not
manifest. The legislature may reasonably have concluded
that, for these and other reasons, corporations axe peculiarly apt instruments for establishing and effectuating
those trusts and combinations against which the prohibition of the statute is directed, that their business
affiliations are not so easily discovered and traced as those
of individuals, and that there was therefore a peculiar
necessityf and fitness in annually requiring from each
corporation a solemn assurance of its non-participation
in the prohibited practices. The Act is, in this respect,
fairly within the wide range of discretion that the States
enjoy in the matter of classification. Missouri, Kansas &

No. 189.

Submitted March 10, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.

Legislation requiring the prompt furnishing of cars by carriers and the
prompt loading of same by shippers and prescribing damages and
penalties for failure on the part of either, is properly, within the
police power of the State; in that respect such legislation differs from
that which simply imposes penalties on the carrier for failure to
pay a specified class of debts, Gulf, Col. & S. F. Ry. v. Ellis, 165
U. S. 150, distinguished.
A police regulation is, the same as any other statute of the State, subject to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
