HERRMANN v. EDWARDS.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

No. 222.

Argued April 14, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.

The rule that, in the absence of diversity of citizenship, jurisdiction of
the District Court over a suit depends upon whether there is a
Federal cause of action stated in the bill applies to suits against
national banks and their directors.
Under the act of August 13, 1888, the Federal courts have not, in the
absence of diverse citizenship, jurisdiction of a suit by a stockholder
against directors of a national bank and the bank to compel the
directors to reimburse the bank for wrongfully investing its funds,
nor has the District Court any jurisdiction of such a suit under
paragraph 16 of § 24, Judicial Code.
The intention of Congress to make such a radical change in the rule

prevailing for many years as to confer jurisdiction on the Federal
courts of all suits by and against national banks will not be presumed
in the absence of clear manifestation of such purpose.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of a suit against a national bank and its directors,
under the Act of August 13, 1888, and paragraph 16,
§ 24 of the Judicial Code, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Shepard Barclay, Mr. S. Mayner Wallace and Mr.
Wm. R. Orthwein for appellant, submitted:
It was error to dismiss the bill for supposed want of
Federal jurisdiction as the powers of the banks under
Federal laws were directly involved.
Where any ingredient of the case is Federal, that jurisdiction is applicable.
The principles of other decisions disclose jurisdiction
over the case in this bill.
The refusal of leave to amend was also error.
The suit arises under the laws of the United States.

Prior to 1882, the District Court had jurisdiction of all

.jurisdiction of actions by or against national banks where
it would have had jurisdiction of actions by or against
citizens of the respective States. Leather Mfrs. Bank v.

The District Court has no jurisdiction in a suit against
the directors of national banks for acts alleged to have
been in fraud and in violation of the National Bank Acts,
where there is not a substantial and meritorious controversy as to the construction or effect of some provision of
the National Bank Act. Whittemore v. Amoskeag Bank,

Opinion of the Court.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of

the court.
If the statutes which control the question for decision
in this case and their significance as settled by the decisions of this court long prior to the commencement of this
suit be at once stated, it will serve to clarify and facilitate
the analysis of the issue to be decided. Section 4 of the
act of Congress of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433,
provided as follows (p. 436):
"That all national banking associations established
under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes
of all actions by or against them, real, personal or mixed,
and all suits in equity, be deemed citizens of the States in
which they are respectively located; anA in such caser tho
oircuit and distriot courtx shall not have jurisdietion ether
tharn

cih v, they would1hA,, in .asoes btw'; ea individual

f thc -z Stato. The provisions of this section
shall not be held to affect the jurisdiction of the courts
of the United States in cases commenced by the United
States or by direction of any officer thereof, or cases for
winding up the affairs of any such bank." (A line is
drawn through certain words for reasons hereafter referred to.)
This section was but a reenactment of an identical provision contained in § 4 of the act of Congress of March 3,
1888 (c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, 554) and again this was but
the reenactment of an identical provision contained in
§ 4 of the act of July 12, 1882 (c. 290, 22 Stat. 162, 163).
Under the provisions of the Act of 1882 long prior to
their reenactment in 1888 it had been conclusively established that because a corporation was a national bank
created under an act of Congress gave it no greater right
to remove a case than if it had been organized under a
state law. Leather Manufacturers' Bank v. Cooper, 120

(Whittemore v. Amoskeag National Bank, 134 U. S. 527)
was decided involving a controversy controlled by the
Act of 1882 but the decision of which was necessarily also
an interpretation of the Act of 1888, as the two were
identical. The case was this: A stockholder of a national
bank on his own behalf and of all others who might join,
sued in a Circuit Court of the United States, the directors of the bank, making the bank also a party defendant, to hold the directors liable for an act of alleged maladministration committed by them. The prayer was that
the directors be decreed to pay back to the bank for the
benefit of its stockholders the amount of money lost by
the bank as the result of their misconduct. There was no
diversity of citizenship upon which the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court could rest and therefore its power to entertain the case rested alone upon the fact that the defendant bank was a national banking association, that the
other defendants were directors of such an association
and that the liability sought to be enforced arose from misconduct on their part in relation to their duties to the
bank. The Circuit Court, not passing upon these questions, dismissed the bill because there had not been a compliance with Equity Rule 94. But this court concluding
that the Act of 1882 excluded jurisdiction as a Federal
court, the action of the court below in dismissing for want
of compliance with the Equity Rule was reversed and
the case remanded with directions to dismiss for want of
jurisdiction as a Federal court. Of course this conclusion
involved deciding that in the absence of a Federal controversy concerning the interpretation of some provision
of the National Bank Act raising what might be considered
by analogy a Federal question in the sense of § 709, Rev.
Stat., a mere assertion of liability on the part of directors
for wrongs for which they might be responsible at common
law, afforded no basis for jurisdiction. Indeed, that this
conception was the one upon which the decision was

HERRMANN v. EDWARDS.
238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

rested is shown by the fact that in the course of the opinion
it was pointed out that neither the pfovisions of § 5209,
Rev. Stat., providing for criminal punishment of directors
of national banks in certain cases, nor § 5239, Rev. Stat.,
giving certain powers to the Comptroller of the Currency
in certain instances, were involved in the cause of action
so as to give rise to a Federal question upon which the
jurisdiction could be based.
This ruling during the many years which have elapsed
has never been questioned and the fundamental principle
upon which it rested has been applied in various aspects.

191 U. S. 119; Yates v. Jones National Bank, 206 U. S.
158; Thomas v. Taylor, 224 U. S. 73.
By § 24 of the Judicial Code of 1911 the jurisdiction of
the district courts is provided for. The sixteenth paragraph of that section gives those courts original jurisdiction as follows:
"Sixteenth. Of all cases commenced by the United
States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against .any
national banking association, and cases for winding up the
affairs of any such bank; and of all suits brought by any
banking association established in the district for which
the court is held, under the provisions of title 'National
Banks,' Revised Statutes, to enjoin the Comptroller of
the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction,
as provided by said title. And all National banking
associations established under the laws of the United
States shall, for the puroses of all other actions by or
against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits in
equity, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are
respectively located."
The statutory law with the concluded interpretat'3n
affixed to it to which we have referred being in force, this
suit was commenced in the court below in March, 1913.
VOL. ccxxxvInI-8

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

The complainant, as a stockholder in the National Bank
of Commerce, a national banking association established
and carrying on business in St. Louis, Missouri, on his own
and on behalf of all other stockholders who might elect
to join in the suit, sought recovery from the defendants,
George Lane Edwards and Benjamin F. Edwards, of an
amount exceeding $1,300,000 for the benefit of the complainant and the other stockholders of the National Bank
of Commerce upon substantially the following grounds:
That the defendants as directors and officers of the National Bank of Commerce, having also a large interest,
direct or indirect, in another national bank known as the
Fourth National Bank, had devised a scheme by which the
National Bank of Commerce would buy out the Fourth
National Bank for a sum utterly disproportionate to the
value of the property and rights to be transferred, thus
despoiling the National Bank of Commerce and its stockholders and wrongfully enriching the Fourth National
Bank and its stockholders to the extent of the inordinate
price which was paid. It was charged that this scheme of
fraud and wrong was a breach of trust on the part of the
two main defendants, and was accomplished by them by
a wrongful and fraudulent exercise and perversion of the
power possessed by them over the business of the National
Bank of Commerce. It was alleged that demand had been
made upon the directors and officers of the National Bank
of Commerce to sue the main defendants for a recovery
of the amount by which they had wrongfully enriched
themselves to the detriment and injury of the National
Bank of Commerce and its stockholders, but they had refused to do so and the directors of the bank were joined as
defendants. The prayer was for an accounting, for a fixing of the amount by which the National Bank of Commerce had been despoiled and for a decree against the defendants to pay the sum so fixed for the benefit of the
stockholders of the National Bank of Commerce. There

HERRMANN v. EDWARDS.
238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

was no diversity of citizenship and jurisdictibn over the
suit therefore depended upon whether there was a Federal
cause of action stated upon which the authority of the
court to entertain the cause could be based.
Except in so far as it may be conceived that a Federal
cause of action giving jurisdiction existed because of the
averment that the National Bank of Commerce was a
United States corporation and the reiterated charges of
wrongdoing and breach of trust by the two main defendants there was nothing in the bill from which it could be
considered that a Federal right adequate to give jurisdiction was asserted unless it be a passage from the bill which
we quote:
"The acts ana transactions of said defendants Behjamin
F. Edwards and George Lane Edwards in the matter of
the transfer of the assets and property of the Fourth National Bank to the National Bank of Commerce were contrary to the, laws of the United States and beyond the
powers, under the acts of Congress in such case made and
provided, of the National Bank of Commerce as an incorporated banking association under the laws of the
United States, and that the acts and doings of the said
Benjamin F. Edwards and George Lane Edwards in promoting, effecting and executing the transfer of the assets,
and property of the Fourth National Bank, aforesaid, to
the National Bank of Commerce were in. violation of the
National Banking laws of the laws governing said banking
institutions, and were furthermore a breach of trust on
the part of said Benjamin F. Edwards and George Lane
Edwards as directors of the Bank of Commerce, and the
facts and circumstances of their interest in the Fourth
National Bank as stockholders and otherwise render their
action as directors in the National Bank of Commerce
in St. Louis in promoting, effecting, and executing the
transfer of the assets and property of the Fourth National
Bank to the National Bank of Commerce, a breach of

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

trust, in that said defendants, Benjamin F. Edwards and
George Lane Edwards, as directors of the National Bank
of Commerce in St. Louis, were in duty bound to execute
the trust which said office provided, in such a manner as
not to promote their own pecuniary and personal interest;
and therefore their acts as aforesaid, were in violation of
the National Banking laws of the United States as well
as contrary to equity and good conscience, and for the
consequences and damages resulting therefrom said Benjanin F. Edwards and George Lane Edwards were and
are liable to the National Bank of Commerce for all damages ensuing on account thereof."
There were demurrers for want of jurisdiction which
were maintained and the bill was dismissed and the case
is here on a direct appeal upon the theory that the power
of the court as a Federal court to entertain the cause is
involved and that that single question is to be determined.
It is, apparent that the general statements made in the
bill to the effect that Federal considerations were essential.
to the determination of the cause of action were but conclusions of law affording no jurisdiction apart from the
right to entertain the cause which would arise from the
substantive and essential facts upon which the bill was
based. Indeed when the averments of the bill are analyzed
there is no escape from the conclusion that the jurisdiction
t'o entertain it could not have been exerted without disregarding the plain letter of the statute in force since 1882.
In fact this inevitable result does not depend upon the
mere text of the statutes referred to since there is an absolute. legal identity between this and the Whittemore
Case and that case hence forecloses every contention here
relied upon.
But it is said that conceding these conclusions inevitably
result from the statute law as it existed prior to the Judicial Code, the Judicial Code has made a radical change in
the law which now requires a different interpretation.

HERRMANN v. EDWARDS.
238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

But we think the contention on the face of the statute is
without foundation and that a brief consideration of the
text of the Act of 1888 and of par. 16 of § 24 of the Judicial
Code will make this clear.
The proposition rests upon the omission from the Judicial Code of the certain words in the Act of 1888 through
which in the quotation which we have previously made a
line has been passed. But when par. 16 of §24 of the
Judicial Code and §4 of the Act of 1888 are considered together, the omission of the words referred to serves at
once to destroy the proposition here relied upon for these
reasons: Section 4 of the Act of. 1888, as will be seen,
opened with the provisions which excluded national banks
from the Federal jurisdiction which otherwise would have
attached to controversies concerning them. This being
done, the statute proceeded to provide that the exclusion
previously specified should not include certain classes of
controversies which it was deemed best should come under
the Federal jurisdiction, thus leaving those classes of cases
under the general rule, since they were carved out by the
last clause of the section from the provisions as to exclusion which were found in the first. In reenacting these
provisions of the Act of 1888 in par. 16 of §24 of the Judicial Code, obviously to make the purpose of the reenacted
statute clearer, just the opposite form of statement was
resorted to, since paragraph 16 opens by conferring Federal
jurisdiction only in those classes of cases which were kept
within that jurisdiction by the concluding clause of §4
of the Act of. 1888, and hence no jurisdiction was given
as to the other classes of cases which were excluded from
such jurisdiction by the Act of 1888. The reenacted section in other words, instead of generally stating what was
excluded from jurisdiction and then carving out exceptions, as was done in the Act of 1888, gave jurisdiction
only in the cases where it was intended to give it and then
proceeded to declare that in all other cases within the

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

contemplation of the section there should be no jurisdiction, thus making the lines clear and broad and leaving no
room for controversy or doubt. Aside from this it is to
be moreover observed that the intention of Congress to
make by the adoption of the Judicial Code so radical a
change from the rule which had prevailed for so long a
period is not to be indulged in without a clear manifestation of such purpose. Besides, as there is no ground for
distinguishing between the restrictions as to jurisdiction
imposed by par. 16 of §24, it must follow that the argument now made based upon the omission of the words
which were found in the Act of 1888 would apply to all of
paragraph 16 and therefore none of the restrictions as to
jurisdiction in that paragraph would be operative. Thus
in both aspects the contention must come to this: that on
the one hand because the provisions of paragraph 16 are
comprehensively all-embracing, they must be held to be
restrictive and on the other hand, that because the provisions of the Act of 1888 were reenacted, they were repealed.
As it follows that the court below was right in dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction as a Federal court to
consider it, its decree is therefore
Affirmed.
