Syllabus.

intoxicating liquors within the State by traveling salesmen
soliciting orders was held to be enforceable in view of the
Wilson Act, even as applied to the business of soliciting,
within the borders of the State, proposals for the purchase
of liquors which were to be consummated by the delivery
within the State of liquors to be brought from without.
That case, however, has no present pertinency, since the
prohibition of the Pennsylvania statute is not addressed
to the business of soliciting contracts for the purchase of
liquor, but to the sale of the liquor itself; and by the terms
of the Wilson Act, as previously construed, the control
of this subject by the several States is postponed until
after the delivery of the liquor within the State.
Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

v.

TRANBARGER.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 214.

Argued March 19, 1915.-Decided June 1, .1915.

In an action for damagesunder the statute of Missouri requiring owners
of railroads to maintain ditches along the right-of-way as amended in
1907 so as to -equire outlets for water across the rights-of-way and
imposing liability and penalties for non-complianbe within three
months after completion and where the embankment causing damage had been erected more than three months prior to the amendment of 1907, held that:
The amendment to the statute was not an ex post facto law: it did not
penalize the. railroad company for the manner in which it originally
built the embankment prior to the amendment but for the manner
in which it maintained it subsequently thereto.
The time limit should properly be construed as relating to railroads

erected after the passage of the act and that, as to those already
constructed reasonable time should be allowed.
It is not necessary for this court to determine what is a reasonable
time for compliance with a police regulation, when that question is
raised by one refusing compliance, not on that ground, but on the
ground that the legislature had no power to enact the statute.
Even though the charter be irrepealable, common-law rules existing at
the time the charter was granted are not so imported into the contract of the charter as to cause such contract to be impaired by subsequent enactment of proper police regulations.
No person has a vested right in any general rule of law or policy of
legislation entitling him to insist upon its remaining unchanged for
his benefit, nor is immunity from change of general rules of law to be
implied as an unexpressed term of an express contract.
The police power of the State cannot be abdicated nor bargained away,
is inalienable even by express grant, and all contract and property
rights are held subject to its fair exercise; it embraces regulations
designed to promote public convenience or general welfare as well
as those in the interest of the public health, morals or safety.
A statute requiring owners of a railroad to provide means for passing
water under embankments is a legitimate exercise of the police
power and not a taking of their property without compensation. It
amounts merely to an application of the maxim sic utere tuo ut
alienum non lwdas.
The enforcement of uncompensated obedience to legitimate police
regulation is not a taking of property without compensation or without due process of law in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Although water may, under common-law rules, be a common enemy
to all property, embankments of railroads, stretching across tracts of
land that are liable to injury from surface water, differ from other
constructions sufficiently to afford a substantial ground for classification and a statute otherwise legal is not unconstitutional under
the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment because it applies exclusively to railroad embankments, whether the
road be owned by individuals or corporations.
250 Missouri, 46, affirmed.

TE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the due process and impairment of contract provisions of
the Federal Constitution of a statute of Missouri requiring
owners of railroads to afford outlets for water across their
rights of way, are stated in-the opiniom-

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mr. Elliott H. Jones, with whom Mr. William C. Scarritt
and Mr. Charles M. Miller were on the brief, for plaintiff
in error:
The Act of Missouri, of March 14, 1907, is an ex post
facto law; it also impairs the contract between State and
railroad. The act takes property without due process
or compensation.
The police power of a State does not justify act 6f 1907
nor is the act a proper exercise of police.
The police power of the State is subject to constitutional
limitations.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
Tranbarger, owner of 60 acres of farming land in Callaway County, Missouri, brought this action against the
Railroad Company in a Missouri state court to recover
damages and a penalty under § 1110 of the Missouri
Revised Statutes of 1899, as amended by act of March 14,
1907, Sess. Acts, p. 169, of which the portion now pertinent
is as follows:

CHICAGO & ALTON R. R. v. TRANBARGER.
238 U. S.

71

Opinion of the Court.

"It shall be the duty of every corporation, company
or person owning or operating any railroad or branch
thereof in this State, and of any corporation, company
or person constructing any railroad in this State, within
three months after the completion of the same through
any county in this State, to cause to be constructed and
maintained suitable openings across and through the right
of way and roadbed of such railroad, and suitable ditches
and drains along each side of the roadbed of such railroad, to connect with ditches, drains, or water-courses,
so as to afford sufficient outlet to drain and carry off the
water, including surface water, along such railroad whenever the draining of such water has been obstructed or
rendered necessary by the construction of such railroad; . .
and any corporation, company or person
failing to comply with the provisions of this section shall
incur a penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars, and
be liable for all damages done by said neglect of duty."
A judgment for damages and a penalty of one hundred
dollars was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State
(250 Missouri, 46), and the case comes here upon questions
respecting the validity of the statute, as construed and
applied, in view of familiar provisions of the Federal
Constitution.
The facts found by the Missouri Supreme Court to be
within the pleadings and proofs and to be sustained by
the verdict of the jury are these: Plaintiff's lands lie in
what are known as the Missouri River bottoms. It is the
habit of that river to overflow the bottoms from the west
to the east in times of high water. Defendant's railroad
extends across the bottoms from southwest to northeast,
and along the easterly boundary of plaintiff's land. The
roadbed is constructed of a solid earth embankment, varying in height from four to seven feet, and is not provided
with traverse culverts, openings, or drains of any kind for
the escape of surface water, but constitutes a solid barrier

72

Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

for collecting such waters, and causes them to back over
and flood plaintiff's lands, which would not be overflowed
except for that obstruction. The road was maintained in
this condition for more than three months before a stated
day in June, 1908, when the River overflowed its banks
and the water ran across the bottoms until it reached the
railroad embankment, which repelled it, so that it backed
.over, upon, and flooded plaintiff's land, causing substantial damage, which was attributable solely to the negligent
failure of defendant to construct suitable openings across
and through the solid embankment upon. which its railroad tracks were laid, and suitable ditches and drains
along the side of the roadbed, to connect with an existing
ditch which would have afforded an outlet into the River
or elsewhere without -flooding plaintiff's land. It further
appears from undisputed evidence cited in the brief of
plaintiff in error that the railroad was constructed about
the year 1872,,and originally was carried by a trestle for a
digtance of 20 to 25 feet over a certain low spot in the
river bottom,, but that this opening was filled in about the
year 1895, since which time the railroad bed has been
maintained as a solid embankment across the bottom.
The statutory requirement of "openings across and
through the right of way and roadbed" originated in the
1907 amendment of § 1110. Before that, and dating
from the year 1874, the statute merely required railroads
to construct ditches along each side of the 'roadbed.

p. 50; Rev. Stat. 1889, § 2614; Laws 1891, p. 82; Rev. Stat.

Mo. App. 398, 402; Kenney v. Kansas City &c. R. R.
(1897), 69 Mo. App. 569, 571.1 It is upon the clause added
in 1907 that the present action is founded, and upon that
clause the questions before us are raised. It is attacked as
an ex post facto law, as a law impairing the obligation of
the contract between the State and the Railroad Company,

CHICAGO & ALTON R. R. v. TRANBARGER.

73

Opinion of the Court.

and as repugnant to the "due process" and "equal protection" provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(1) The argument that in respect of its penalty feature
the statute is invalid as an ex post facto law is sufficiently
answered by pointing out that plaintiff in error is subjected
to a penalty not because of the manner in which it originally constructed its railroad embankment, nor for anything else done or omitted before the passage of the act
of 1907, but because after that time it maintained the
embankment in a manner prohibited by that act. The
argument to the contrary is based upon a reading of the
section that applies the limiting clause "within three
months after the completion of the same" to railroads
already in existence as well as to those to be constructed
thereafter. The result is, according to the argument, that
as the road of plaintiff in error was constructed upon a
solid embankment at least as early as the year 1895, the
act was violated as soon as enacted. This construction is
so unreasonable that we should 'not adopt it unless required to do so by a decision of the state court of last resort. The language of the sectibn as it now stands: "It
shall be the duty of every corporation . . . owning
or operating any railroad or branch thereof in this State,
and of any corporation . . . constructing any railroad in this State, within three months after the completion of the same through any county in this State, to cause
to be constructed and maintained suitable openings,"
etc., seems to us to be more reasonably construed as
prescribing the express limit of three months only with
respect to railroads afterwards constructed,. and as allowing to railroads already in existence a reasonable time
after the passage of the enactment within which to construct the openings. In adopting this meaning, we have
regard not merely to the phrases employed, but to the
previous course of legislation, which is set forth in the
briefs but need not be here repeated. Whether we are

74

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

right or wrong about this, the duty to construct transverse
outlets having originated with the act of 1907, the statute
is of course to be construed as allowing some time-either
three months, or a reasonable time more or less than that
period-for their construction by railroads already in
existence. The law had been upon the statute books for
more than a year before the flood that gave rise to this
action. Whether three months, or a year, was a reasonable
time, or whether more time would reasonably be required
for the construction of the prescribed opening across the
railroad of plaintiff in error at the place in question, is a
matter that we need not determine, since no such issue
was raised in the state courts, plaintiff in error having
contented itself with asserting that the legislature had no
power td require it at any time after the act of 1907 to
construct such an opening.
(2) Upon the question of impairment of contract, it
appears that the railroad in question was constructed and
afterwards leased to plaintiff in error in perpetuity by
virtue of a charter and franchise granted to the Louisiana
& Missouri River Railroad Company in the year 1870
(Laws, p. 93, §§ 22, 23, 43), by § 33 of which the company
was exempted from the provisions of § 7 of Article I of
the general corporation act of 1855 (Rev. Stat. 1855,
p. 371), and thereby, it is claimed, relieved from the legislative power of alteration, suspension, and repeal. And
while by the constitution of 1865 (in force at the time the
railroad in question was authorized and constructed),
railroad corporations could be formed only under general
laws subject to amendment or repeal, it is contended that
this did not apply to subsequent amendments of charters
previously granted (State, ex rel. Circuit Attorney v. Railroad, 48 Missouri, 468; St. Joseph & Iowa Ry. v. Shambaugh, 106 Missouri, 557, 569), and it is pointed out that
the charter of 1870 is an amendment Of one enacted in
1868 (Laws, p. 97), and this in turn an amendment of

CHICAGO & ALTON R. R. v. TRANBARGER.
238 U. S.

75

Opinion of the Court.

one enacted in 1859 (Laws 1859, 1st Sess., p. 400). It is
further insisted that even if the State reserved to itself by
the constitution of 1865 the right to alter or amend the
corporate charter, this was relinquished when the constitution of 1875 went into effect, which contains no similar reservation. And hence, it is argued that, as applied
to this company, the act of 1907 cannot be sustained as a
charter amendment. This is disputed; but for present
purposes we will assume the charter was irrepealable.
Next, it is insisted that for all purposes except those
covered by the act of 1907, Missouri has at all times adhered to the common-law rule that surface water is a
common enemy, against which every landowner may protect himself as best he can, and that this applies to and
protects railroads as well as other landowners. Abbott v.
Kansas City &c. Ry. (1884), 83 Missouri, 271, 280 et seq.;
Jones v. St. Louis &c. Ry., 84 Missouri, 151, 155; Schneider
v. Missouri Pacific Ry., 29 Mo. App. 68, 72; Ready v.
Missouri Pacific Ry., 98 Mo. App. 467. The conclusion
sought to be drawn is that the common-law rule, as it
existed at the time the railroad was built and the right of
way acquired, entered into the contract between the
State and the company, and into the contracts between
the company and the landowners from whom its right of
way was acquired, and that the immunity from prosecution and from private action alike was in the nature of an
appurtenance to the land, the enjoyment of which could
not be impaired by subsequent legislation.
Of the cases cited in support of this contention the only
one that has a semblance of pertinency is Muhlker v.
Harlem Railroad Co., 197 U. S. 544, and this is readily
distinguishable. There the right in question was the easement of light and air, which of course pertains closely to
the use and enjoyment of the land. But the right to maintain a railroad embankment or other artificial structure
in such a manner as to deflect surface water from its

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

usual course, and thereby injure the land of another, has
little reference to the substantial enjoyment of the railroad right of way. Nor is it at all essential to the
protection of the railroad itself from surface water. It
cannot reasonably be contended that a railroad cannot
be maintained and operated as safely and as conveniently
over a bridge, trestle, culvert, or other opening calculated
to admit the passage of surface water, as upon a solid embankment, or that there is any substantial advantage in
favor of the latter except that it avoids the expenditure
necessary to be made for the construction and maintenance
of openings in order that the embankment shall no longer
be the occasion of injury to the lands of others. The previous immunity from responsibility for such injury was
nothing more than a general rule of law, which was not
in terms or by necessary intendment imported into, the
contract. For just as no person has a vested right in any
general rule of law or policy of legislation entitling him
to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit
(Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134; Hurtado v. California,
1.10 U. S. 516, 532; Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U. S. 470,
493; Martin v. Pittsburg &c. R. R., 203 U.S. 284, 294),
so an immunity from a change of the general rules of law
will not ordinarily be implied as an unexpressed term of an
express contract. See Gross v. United States Mortgage Co.,
108 U. S. 477, 488; Pennsylvania R. R. v. Miller, 132 U. S.
75, 83.
(3) But a more satisfactory answer to the argument
under the contract clause, and one which at the same time
refutes the contention of plaintiff in error under the due
process clause, is that the statute in question was passed
under the police power of the State for the general benefit
of the community at large and for the purpose of preventing unnecessary and wide-spread injury to property.
It is established by repeated decisions, of this court that
neither of these provisions of the Federal Constitution

Opinion of the Court.

has the effect of overriding the power of the State to establish all regulations reasonably necessary to sebure the
health, safety, or general welfare of the community; that
this power can neither be abdicated nor bargained away,
and is inalienable even by express grant; and that all contract and property rights are held subject to its fair exercise. Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 558,

power embraces regulations designed to promote the publie convenience or the general welfare and prosperity, as

or safety. Lake Shore & Mich. Southern Ry. v. Ohio, 173
U. S. 285, 292; C., B. & Q. Ry. v. DrainageCommissioners,
200 U. S. 561, 592; Bacon v. Walker, 204 U. S. 311, 317.
We deem it very clear that the act under consideration
is a legitimate exercise of the pqlice power, and not in any
proper sense a taking of the property of plaintiff in error.
The case is not at all analogous to those which have held
that the taking of a right of way across one's land for a
drainage ditch, where no water-course exists,'is a taking
of property within the meaning of the Constitution. The
present regulation is for the prevention of damage attributable to the railroad embankment itself, and amounts
merely to an application of the maxim sic utere tuo ut
alienum non lxdae. Of course, compliance with it involves
the expenditure of money; but so does compliance with
regulations requiring a railroad company to keep its roadbed and right of way free from combustible matters; to
provide its locomotive engines with spark arresters; to
fence its tracks; to provid. cattle guards and gates at
crossings, or bridges or viaducts, or the like. Such regulations as these are closely analogous in principle, and have
been many times sustained as constitutional. Minneapolis Railway Co. v. Beckwith, 129 U. S. 26, 31; Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway v. Em.nons, 149 U. S. 364,

Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 560, 561.
And it is well settled that the enforcement of uncompensated obedience to a legitimate regulation established
under the police power is not a taking of property without
compensation, or without due process of law, in the sense
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, Burlington &c.

(4) The contention that the statute in question denies
to plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws is not
seriously pressed, and is quite unsubstantial. Railroad
embankments, stretching unbroken across tracts of land
that are liable to injury from surface waters, differ so
materially from other artificial constructions and improvements to which the doctrine of the "common enemy" applies, that there is very plainly a substantial ground for
classification with respect to the object of the legislation.
The statute applies alike to corporations, companies, and
persons owning or operating railroads that axe so constructed as to obstruct the flow of drainage and surface
waters, and we deem it unexceptionable in this regard.
