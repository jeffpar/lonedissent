Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

PRODUCERS OIL OOMPANY v. HANZEN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
No. 165.

Submitted March 3, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.

The effect of riparian rights, attached to land conveyed by patent of
the United States, depends upon the local law.
As a general rule, meanders are not to be treated as boundaries and
when the United States conveys a tract of land by patent referring
to an official survey which shows the same bordering on a navigable
river, the purchaser takes title up to the water line.
Where the facts and circumstances, however, affirmatively disclose an
intention to limit the grant to actual traverse lines, these must be
treated as definite boundaries; and a patent to a fractional section
does not necessarily confer riparian rights because of the presence
of meanders.
Where, as in this case, the survey of improved lands was made at the
express request of the occupant to whom they were subsequently
patented, and the grant specified the number of acres, and other
circumstances also indicated that only the lands conveyed were
those within the traverse lines, the patent of the United States conferred no riparian rights but simply conveyed the specified number
of acres.
In a controversy between individuals as to the extent of the land conveyed by a patent of the United States, and to which the United
States is not a party, nothing in the opinion or judgment should
be taken to prejudice or impair any of the rights of the United States
in the lands-affected.
61 So. Rep. 754, affirmed.
THE, facts, which involve the title to property conveyed by a United States patent and the construction
of such patent and the amount of land conveyed thereby,
are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Edgar H. Farrarfor plaintiff in error:
The action is possessory, and no question of title is
involved, or can be decided, because not in issue.
Actual possession of part of an estate, with title to
the whole, is possession of the whole, and gives the holder
of the title the right to maintain a possessory action as

to the part not actually occupied or physically possessed.
Sallier v. Bartlett, 113 Louisiana, 400; Jones v. Gossett,
115 Louisiana, 926; Leonard v. Garrett, 128 Louisiana, 542.
In an action to protect constructive possession of part of
an estate not in actual possession, titles are averred and
put in issue solely to show the nature and extent of possession. Mott v. Hopper, 116 Louisiana, 629.
The mining laws of the United States do not grant
the right to search for minerals in lands which are the
property of individuals, nor authorize any disturbance
of the title or possession of such lands. Del Monte Mining
Co. v. Last Chance Co., 171 U. S. 55.
Defendants, not having discovered any oil on the
lands seized by them, and posted and surveyed as a mining claim, before doing such acts, got no rights of possession or any other rights under the mining laws of the
United States as against the constructive possession of
such lands by plaintiff. Discovery must precede location. Rev. Stat., ยง 2320; Enterprise Co. v. Rico-Aspen
Co., 167 U. S. 168; Calhoun Mining Co. v. Ajax Co., 182
U. S. 499; Mining Co. v. Tunnel Co., 196 U. S. 337.
Discovery of oil after this suit was brought, and after
the land was seized under a writ of sequestration, and
released by the defendants on bond, does not relieve them
from being trespassers; their rights must be determined
as of the time when they invaded the premises.
Defendants, being mere trespassers on lands prima
facie conveyed to the plaintiff, and covered by the patent
and plat of the United States to plaintiff's vendors, and
at the time of the trespass in the constructive possession
of the plaintiff, cannot be heard to contest the plaintiff's
claim to the property under the patent of the United
States or the survey and plat on which the patent is based.

showing a meander or traverse line all around the border
of the bounding stream, drawn in accordance with the field
notes, and showing no surveyed land between the meander
line and the water's edge, conveys to the grantee any land
actually existing between the meander line and the water
line. Railroad Co. v. Schurmeir, 7 Wall. 272; Mitchel v.
Smale, 140 U. S. 406, 414; Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S. 371;

87; United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 209 U. S.447.
Grants of the United States for lands bounded on
streams and other waters, without any reservation or
restriction of terms, are to be construed, as to their effect,
according to the law of the State in which the lands lie.
Hardin v. Jordan, supra; Whitaker v. McBride, supra.
If the Federal grant is, by its terms, riparian, then the
local law determines the rights of the riparian grantee.
The action of the state court in ignoring the official plat
on which plaintiff's patent was based, and the meander
line delineated on that plat, was purely arbitrary.
The intent of the United States Government is paramount; if that intent was to make the line delineated a
meander and not a boundary line, it must be so held.
Official patents and surveys of the United States cannot be attacked collaterally, or in litigations between
private persons. Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, 158 U. S.240;
Russell v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., 158 U. S.253; Home v.
Smith, 159 U. S.40; Whitaker v. McBride, 197 U. S.510.
Mr. David T. Watson and Mr. Eugene Mackey for defendant in error:
A Government patent is construed against the grantee.
The patent shows no intent to convey the land in
controversy. The Bristol survey was made at the request
of the patentee and was a survey of his improvements.

He and his successors never took possession of the land.
The Bristol survey line was not in fact a meander line.
The words "spur of marsh extend out north" exclude this
land. The omission of three hundred acres to the south
shows that the Bristol survey line was not a meander line.
Calling it a meander in Bristol's notes is not controlling.
The Government plat is not conclusive.
Whether defendant could question plaintiff's title in a
possessory action under the Louisiana practice is not a
Federal question. The writ 'of error does not present the
question of defendant in error's title under the mining laws.
Under the mining laws defendant in error's title is valid.
The alleged removal of a raft in the Red River was
not proved and presents no Federal question.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
court.

Plaintiff in error-The Oil Company-instituted this
action July 1, 1910, in the District Court, Caddo Parish,
Louisiana, for the purpose of establishing its right to possession of part of Lot No. 1, Section 4, Township 20, North,
Range 16, West, suddenly become very valuable through
discovery of gas and oil. The petition alleges that the
United States in 1874 sold to one Pitts Lots 1 and 2, Section 4, forming a projection known as "Wilson's Point,"
surrounded on three sides by waters of James Bayou, a
navigable stream; that he immediately entered and together with his successors remained in peaceful, complete
possession until April 2, 1910, when defendants in error,
without knowledge of Noel, then 'owner, wrongfully
entered upon part of Lot No. 1, built a wire fence and
placed a keeper thereon; that April 15, 1910, by notarial
act duly recorded, the Oil Company purchased both lots
from Noel and became subrogated to his rights and when
it came to subject the whole property to actual possession
a portion was found occupied as above indicated.
A writ of sequestration, issued contemporaneously with
filing of petition, was subsequently dissolved upon motion,
a proper bond having been given conditioned not to commit waste and to make faithful restitution of fruits if so
required.
Answering, defendants in error denied they were occupying any part of Lot No. 1, Section 4, but said they were and
had been since April 2, 1910, in possession of 87.9 acres situated in Sections 3 and 4, Township 20, described by metes

and bounds, "which said property your respondents located under the laws of the United States relative to the location of mining lands and upon which they have made a
discovery of oil and gas, and are, therefore, entitled to the
full use and enjoyment and to a patent from the United
States." They also denied the Oil Company or any of "its
ancestors in tit!e ever had or claimed possession to any part
of the property so located by your respondents; but, that,
on the contrary, your respondents aver that the said land
was never in the possession of any person until the location
by them." Further answering they averred that "Thomas
H. Pitts purchased from the United States, among other
property, Lot Otte of Section Four, Township Twenty
North of Range Sixteen West, containing 12.84 acres and
that he paid for the same with military land warrants,
as containing that acreage; that the said Lot One of Section Four is figured and described on the surveys of the
United States by certain metes and bounds, shown on the
said plat, the eastern boundary of said lot, as well as the
other boundaries thereof, being shown on the said map;
that the East line of said lot which is the boundary between the land of respondents and that of plaintiff, did
not and does not denote the banks of any body of water,
but that, on the contrary, the said line was run through
the hills as the line of boundary of the said lot; that the
land of which your respondents are-in possession and which
they located under their mineral filing aforesaid, -is high.
land, not subject to overflow at any time, and which never
constituted any part of any lake or bayou and which was
left out of the surveys of the United States and which
remained the property of the Government until said location had been made thereon by your respondent."
There were introduced in evidence patents from the
Government, field notes and attending documents, official
plat, sundry conveyances, contour maps-one prepared
by Williams for plaintiff company, another by Barnes for

defendants,-Barbour's survey of Sections 9, 10, 15 and 16,
and photographs showing landscape and vegetation. Witnesses were examined in behalf of both sides chiefly in
explanation of lines, maps, water levels, character of land
and growth thereon. A draft of the official plat (5/6 original size) is in the margin; on the following page is a copy
of the combination map (much reduced) showing the
Bristol, Williams, Barnes, and Barbour surveys especially
referred to by the Louisiana Supreme Court. At the trial
the following stipulation was made part of the record:
"It is admitted by both parties that J. S. Noel was in
possession, as owner, from the' date of his purchase in 1880
[1884], to the sale to the plaintiffs of the property known
as the Wilson's Point place, his corporeal possession being
limited on the East and North by the Bristol meander line,
and said Noel never exercised any acts of corporeal possession, or was ever in occupancy of any land in Section Four,
East of, or outside of the said meander line, or of any of the
land in controversy. This is not intended to apply to any
other land West of the land in controversy. That Noel's
possession was vested by act of purchase and continued
by occupancy in the Plaintiffs.
"It is further admitted that defendants on the second day of April, 1910, took actual possession of, and
posted and filed notices of location under the placer mining
laws of the United States, of the tract of land on which
they are now in possession, and concerning which this
suit is brought, which tract of land is described by metes
and bounds in defendants' answer.
"It is further admitted that when defendants
took
possession of said land, they -located the western boundary
line of their location, as the Bristol meander line, as properly located, and the defendant does not claim the ownership or possession of any land west of the true location of
said Bristol meander line.
"It is admitted that since the institution of this suit

238 U. S.

'There being a dispute between the Plaintiff and Defendants as to the true location of the Bristol meander line
referred to above, it is agreed that the said issue as to the
true and exact location of said line is not to be passed upon
in this case, said issue being relegated to a subsequent proceeding herein, should the Court sustain the defendants'
position that said line is the true boundary between the
property, and the question of costs and damages are likewise relegated to further proceedings."
Prior to 1858 Alfred Wilson squatted on the point since
known by his name and during that year sold to Ann Pitts
improvements upon "160 acres more' or less" lying
thereon. In April, 1871, Thomas H. Pitts applied to the
United States for a survey of the land-long improved and
then occupied-and shortly thereafter (July, 1871) this
was made by Byron Bradley Bristol, duly certified and
reported as "Field Notes of the Survey of Wilson's
Point." From these notes, referring among other things
to enclosure, corn field, fence, dwelling and road, the official plat or diagram was made in the office of the SurveyorGeneral of Louisiana with actual traverse lines marked out.
This plat shows fractional Section 4, immediately north of
Section 9-divided into two lots, No. 1 on the east, 12.84
acres, and No. 2 west, 11.44 acres-on a point upon the
left bank and surrounded on three sides by waters of James
Bayou. It is very small and does not indicate with certainty whether traverse lines or the stream constitute north
and east boundaries. In respect of this fractional Section 4
the surveyor's field notes in part recite: "July 27th,
1871. Meanders of the left Bank of James Bayou begin
at the corner between fractional sections 9 and 4 [southeast corner of Lot No. 1, Section 4], a gum tree at 24.50
West of the corner of sections 3, 4, 9 and 10; run thence
down stream in fractional sec. 4; N. 2 degrees E. 6.00;

1.10, enter Pitts' enclosure; N. 39 2 degrees W. 3.00, enter
corn field;" thence according to seven designated calls
bearing westerly and southerly around Lot No. 2 "to the
corner to fractional sect. 4 and 9, thence in sect. 9," etc.
Under "General Description" this note appears-" The
front land on James' Bayou is above the common average.
The back land is thin and poor, post oak, flat. James'
Bayou is navigable in ordinary seasons for large boats.
The slough or water course near the original transverse in
front of Sec. 10, is now dry and can only be traced by the
rotten drift wood."
March 1, 1878, Thomas H. Pitts received from the
United States 4 conveyance of "Northwest quarter of the
Northeast quarter of Section Nine,
containing
Forty Acres, according to the official plat." By patent
dated February 18, 1892, which recites a soldier's warrant
for 120 acres had been deposited, the United States conveyed to Thomas H. Pitts "Lots numbered one, two,
three and four of Section Nine and the Lots numbered
one and two of Section Four in Township Twenty North,
of Range Sixteen West, of Louisiana, Meridian, in the
District of Lands subject to sale at Natchitoches, Louisiana, containing One Hundred and Twenty-three acres
and eighty-eight hundredths of an acre, according to the
Official Plat of the Survey of said Lands returned to the
General Land Office by the Surveyor-General."
Pitts' title to 163.88 acres "with all buildings and improvements," described substantially as in his two patents-one for forty acres, the other 123.88 acres-was
conveyed November 23, 1880, to Walsch for $250.00;
February 15, 1884, Walsch conveyed to Noel for $300.00;
and on April 15, 1910, Noel conveyed the 163.88 acres
"more or less" to plaintiff company for recited consideration of $50,000.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

238 U.S.

It appears that north and northeast from the northernmost traverse line of Lot No., 1 designated in field notes
"S. 86V2 degrees W. 2.50, spur of marsh extends out
North," and between it and James Bayou, there is and was
at time of Bristol survey a narrow ridge -of high land
1636.8 feet long and contiguous fast ground, amounting
altogether to about forty acres (87 according to defendants' estimate), upon which is much large growing timber
including cypress, hickory, gum and oak-one oak 400
feet beyond the traverse lines being 14 feet in circumference. This is the land in dispute. To the south of the
Bristol survey and outside its traverse lines lie 300 acres of
fast land surveyed and platted by Barbour in 1896.
The Oil Company claimed traverse lines around Lot
No. 1 must be treated as true meanders; that being owner
and in actual possession of the lot it had constructive
possession of land lying beyond such lines east and north
to the Bayou-forty acres or more; and that this was being trespassed upon. Defendants in error maintained the
traverse lines were not intended as true meanders; that the
grant was limited by courses and distances specified; and
lands north and east of these were left unsurveyed with
title remaining in the Government.
The trial court sustained The Oil Company's contention
and adjudged it entitled to be maintained in possession of
Lot No. 1 "and that the tongue of land, on which defendants and their lessee have drilled an oil well, projecting
North, and bounded North, East and West by Jeems
Bayou, is a constituent and component part of Lot Number One, the boundary of said Lot Number One being the
water line of Jeems Bayou; it being the purpose of this
judgment to fix Jeems Bayou as the boundary of said lot
without regard to any arbitrary lines of survey."
Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Louisiana (132
Louisiana, 691, 698-700, 703, 707) reversed the judgment
of the trial court. It declared-" Plaintiff claims posses-

Opinion of the Court.

sion of the land in this suit as owner; and it produces a title
from the United States government showing it to be the
owner of Lot No. 1, containing 12.84 acres, and it claims
the additional 40 or 87 acres, as the case may be, as a part
of lot No. 1, lying between the Bristol meander line and
Jeems Bayou; treating said meander line as a regular
meander line, and not a boundary line. But, we cannot so
consider it; particularly in view of the admission of plaintiff that: 'It is admitted by both parties, that the land in
controversy is high land, and was high land at the date
that Bristol made his survey in 1871.'
As plaintiff and its authors held no title to the land referred to it
has had neither actual nor constructive possession of the
same, and cannot therefore be heard to complain of the
acts of these defendants. Its demand for possession must
be denied. The meander line established by Bristol on the
east and northeast of lot No. 1 does not meet any of the
requirements set forth by the Supreme Court of the
United States in defining a meander line in Railroad Co. v.
Schurmeir, 7 Wall. 272, 286. . . . Tested by this definition, which is sustained by all authorities, the so-called
meander line of Bristol fails in all respects. Niles v. Cedar
Point Club, 175 U. S. 300. . . . A glance at the
annexed map, taken from the Williams and Barnes maps
in the record, (Bristol made no map or plat, and the orle
made by the draftsman in the Land Office is very small
and apparently without reference to a scale), shows that
the Bristol meander line does not purport to define the
sinuosities of a stream; it is not represented as the border
line of a stream; and it shows, to a demonstration, that
the meander line, as actually run on the land on the east
and northeast of lot No. 1, is the boundary, and that a
water course is not the boundary. . . . The evidence
in the record in this case, aside from the admissions of
record, shows that there was. and is a large quantity of
swamp or marsh land on the east and north of the Bristol

meander line. .
If the eastern and northern
boundaries of lot No. 1 were taken out and other boundaries substituted, so as to reach Jeems Bayou, plaintiff
would get three to seven fold more land than was actually
mentioned and described in the patent conveying this
lot, or than its ancestor in title supposed he was purchasing, or than he actually paid for."
The cause is here by writ of error and the Oil Company
maintains that it was obligatory upon the Supreme Court
to accept the Government survey, plat and patent as
correct; to treat traverses about Lot No. 1 as true meanders of the Bayou; and to hold, in consequence, that
boundaries of the grant extended to the stream and include
the locus in quo. The substantial Federal question presented-the only one for our determination-is whether
properly construed thd original patent conveyed to Pitts
land lying between platted traverse lines and waters of the
navigable stream. Waters-PierceOil Co. v. Texas (No. 1),

Opinion of the Court.

Chapman v. St. Francis, 232 U. S. 186, 196; Gauthier v.
Morrison, 232 U. S. 452, 459; Forsyth v. Smale, 7 Biss.
201 (9 Fed. Cas. No. 4950, p. 471). A reviewand analysis
of these cases would be tedious and unprofitable; thorough
acquaintance with the varying and controlling facts is
essential to a fair understanding of them. They unquestionably support the familiar rule relied on by counsel
for the Oil Company that in general meanders are not to
be treated as boundaries and when the United States conveys a tract of land by patent referring to an official plat
which shows the same bordering on a navigable river the
purchaser takes title up to the water line. But they no
less certainly establish the principle that facts and circumstances may be examined and if they affirmatively
disclose an intention to limit the grant to actual traverse
lines these must be treated as definite boundaries. It
does not necessarily follow from the presence of meanders
that a fractional section borders a body of water and that
a patent thereto confers riparian rights.
In the instant case we find a survey of improved lands
made at the express request of the occupant to whom they
were subsequently patented; a -grant from the United
-States specifying the exact number of acres conveyed;
a positive declaration in. field notes that land to the north
lies outside the traverse lines; admission that excluded
area contains not less than 40 acres of high ground, and
evidence of large timber growing there; official plat delineating the surveyor's courses and specifying acreage
of the several subdivisions, which cannot be said to indicate a water boundary beyond possible question.
Outside the southern traverses of this plat, n space
designated "Open Lake," lie 300 acres of fast land surveyed by Barbour in 1896. Although Noel, the Oil

Considering all disclosures of the record we are unable
to conclude the court below erred in holding original
patent from the United States* to Pitts conveyed no
title to lands in controversy, and its judgment must be
affirmed.
It seems proper to add that nothing in this opinion or

RAILROAD & WAREHOUSE COMMISSION.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT

OF THE STATE OF

MINNESOTA.
No. 225.

Argued April 16, 1915.-Decided June 14, 1915.

An order of a state railroad commission requiring a railroad company
to install and maintain scales amountsto a taking-of the company's
property; and, if the order is arbitrary or unreasonable, the taking
is without due process of law and in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The facts established must be adequate as a matter of law to support a
finding of requisite public necessity in justifying an order of a state
