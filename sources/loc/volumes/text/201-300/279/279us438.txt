it is sought to justify what until justified is a wrong.
But, whatever the motive, nothing is shown or suggested
by the evidence to justify the general boycott that the
Secretary's order forbade. The Secretary's order should
be enforced, but without prejudice to the right of the appellees to refuse to deal with the Producers Commission
Association in matters beyond its power.
A suggestion was made that the last named association
was not within the protection of the Act of Congress.
We see nothing in the limitation of its powers to prevent
it, the statute seems to recognize it, § 306 (f), and the
corporation was found by the Secretary to be a market
agency duly registered as such.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION.

No. 17 Original. Argued January 2, 3, 1929.-Decided May 20, 1929.
1. The power of this Court to issue a writ of prohibition need not be
determined in a case where, assuming the power to exist, there is no
basis for exercising it. P. 448.
2. Article III of the Constitution does not express the full authority
of Congress to create courts. Other Articles invest Congress with
powers in the exertion of which it may create inferior courts and
clothe them with functions deemed essential or helpful in carrying
these powers into execution. P. 449.
3. Courts established under the specific power given in § 2 of Article
III are called constitutional courts. They share in the exercise of
the judicial power defined in that section, can be invested with no
other jurisdiction, and have judges who hold office during good
behavior, with no power in Congress to provide otherwise. Id.
4. Courts created by Congress in the exertion of other powers are
called legislative courts. Their functions always are directed to the
execution of one or more of such powers and are prescribed by
Congress independently of § 2 of Article III; and their judges hold
for such term as Congress prescribes, whether it be a fixed period
of years or during good behavior. Id.

5. A duty to give decisions which are advisory only, and so without
force as judicial judgments, may be laid on a legislative court,
but not on a constitutional court established under Article III.
P. 454.
6. In Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, the question whether the Court
of Claims is a statutory or a constitutional court was not mooted;
and the decision is not to be taken as attributing to that court a
constitutional status contrary to earlier rulings. P. 455.
7. A court may be a court of the United States within the meaning
of § 375 of Title 28, U. S. C., Jud. Code § 260, and yet not be
a constitutional court. Id.
8. The Court of Customs Appeals is a legislative court. P. 458.
9. The matter involved in this case-an appeal under § 316 of the
Tariff Act of 1922 from findings of the Tariff Commission sustaining a charge of unfair competition and from the recommendation of the Commission to the President that the articles to which
the findings relate shall be excluded from entry,--is within the
jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals, whether or not it
be a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III, § 2,
of the Constitution. P. 460.
Prohibition denied.

Mr. Samuel M. Richardson, with whom Mr. Albert

The Act and its legislative history, the congressional
debates, and the reports of the Senate Committee on
Finance, which committee initiated the legislation, indicate that Congress intended to create an inferior court
under Article III of the Constitution.
The matters to be heard by the Court of Customs Appeals are cases and controversies, within Liberty Warehouse v. Grannis, 273 U. S. 70; Postum Cereal Co. v.

court under Article III. See Keller v. Potomac Electric
Co., 261 U. S. 428.
The Court of Claims, by analogy similar to the Court of
Customs Appeals, is an inferior court of the United States
under Article III of the Constitution. United States v.
Klein, 13 Wall. 128; Miles v. Graham,268 U. S. 501. The
inquiry presents itself: If a judge of the Court of Claims
is exempt from income tax, how can he be thus exempt
except under Article III of the Constitution?
Congress, in creating courts, can only do so where especially authorized by the Constitution. There is no extra.
constitutional power to create courts. All constitutional
courts of the United States are courts of limited jurisdiction. Hodgson & Thompson v. Bowerbank, 5 Cranch
303; Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393; McAllister v. United
States, 141 U. S. 174; American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet.
511.
It has been suggested that courts of the United States
might be established, without regard to the provisions of
the Constitution, by virtue of the right of sovereignty
which exists in the Government of the United States.
The answer is that the United States Government has no
sovereign power over the States or the people of the
United States, except that which has been conferred by
the Constitution. And as to the States and the people
thereof, the judicial power of the United States was expressly conferred and limited, both as to courts and as to
jurisdiction, by Article III of the Constitution. Accordingly, there can be no sovereign or inherent power in the
Government of the United States superior to that conferred by Article III.
The Court of Customs Appeals is a court of limited,
not of general, jurisdiction, and this is true of every federal court. The courts in England and in the several
States of the United States, however, are courts of general
jurisdiction. Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393. Not only

EX PARTE BAKELITE CORP'N.

is the jurisdiction of the federal courts limited by the
Constitution, but that jurisdiction has been further limited by the failure of Congress to confer upon the courts
all of the jurisdiction provided for in the Constitution.
Turner v. Bank, 4 Dall. 6. This being so, there is no
reason for suggesting that, because a court established
by Congress is given a jurisdiction over a special class of
justiciable questions, it is not an inferior court of the
United States.
The term " inferior courts" relates to United States
Courts established by Congress pursuant to Article III, §
1, of the Constitution, and means those courts inferior
to the Supreme Court of the United States. Turner v.
Bank, supra;McCormick v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 192.
Special courts, such as the Court of Private Land
Claims, etc., are clearly distinguishable from the Court of
Customs Appeals. United States v. Coe, 155 U. S. 76;
Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648; United States v.
Klein, supra.
For nineteen years, the Court of Customs Appeals has
been functioning as a useful and respected part of the
judicial system of the country. During that time, its
presiding and associate judges have been commissioned
by the President, with the approval of the Department of
Justice, during good behavior. One of its judges, after
eighteen years of service, has been retired, under the general retirement act, and is now drawing his compensation,
by approval of the Department of Justice. Another such
judge now serving on the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals is eligible for retirement. If the Court of Customs Appeals be not an inferior constitutional court of
the United States, then its judges are not entitled to retirement, as they were not given statutory life tenure,
James v. United States, 202 U. S. 401, their salaries may
be decreased at any time and themselves be removed from
office, for partisan or other purposes. There is much

doubt as to whether judges of other inferior constitutional
courts of the United States may sit with them and supply
vacancies. The practical effect of such a construction is
to destroy the court that Congress so carefully provided
for in the act creating it.
Attorney General Mitchell, with whom Mr. Robert P.
Reeder, of the Department of Justice, was on the brief,
for respondent.
The principal question in this case is whether an appeal by an importer to the Court of Customs Appeals
under § 316 of the Tariff Act of 1922, to review the findings of the Commission that imported articles come into
unfair competition with domestic industries, presents a
judicial case or controversy under § 2 of Article III of the
Constitution. In this connection, the feature of this case
requiring particular scrutiny is that judicial review of the
findings of the Tariff Commission occurs before final
administrative action by the President, who is at liberty
to refrain from further action because of disagreement
with the findings of the Commission, and the question
thus arises whether at an intermediate stage of administrative action a judicial review of the administrative proceedings presents a case or controversy if, following the
judicial action, the findings reviewed and approved by the
court may be disapproved by administrative action and
further proceedings discontinued.
This Court may also have occasion to consider whether
the Court of Customs Appeals is an inferior court of the
United States organized pursuant to Article III of the
Constitution.
The question whether the appeal presented a case or
controversy should be considered first, because this Court
may not find it necessary to go further. In order to decide that question, it is necessary to determine the meaning, operation, and effect of §316, and particularly

EX PARTE BAKELITE CORP'N.
438

Argument for Respondent.

whether the findings of the Commission are conclusive
on the President or merely advisory. The action of the
Commission and the President in raising duties or excluding importations under § 316 is not entirely legislative
or administrative as under § 315. Its provisions are penal
in their nature, imposing increased duties or exclusion
of importations because of unfair competition. Because
of this and the possible necessity of due process, the provision for judicial review was made. Here the judicial
review comes not after administrative action is finished,
but midway in the administrative proceedings. Although
the provisions of the section are somev.what conflicting and
ambiguous, their fair meaning is that if the Commission
finds there is no unfair competition, its finding is binding
on the President and he may not adopt a different conclusion and raise duties or exclude articles; that if the
Commission finds that there is unfair competition and
recommends action by the President, he is at liberty to
reach a different conclusion and refuse to act. The result
is that the findings of the Commission are controlling on
the President in the sense that if he acts, it must be in
accordance with the Commission's findings. The case,
therefore, is that the findings of the Commission form a
final and indisputable basis of action by the President, if
he acts, but he has the power to disapprove the findings
and take no action, and the question is whether this prevents the appeal from the Tariff Commission's findings
constituting a case or controversy.
It has been held that where the law provides that action'
of an administrative body, although reviewed and approved by a court, is merely advisory or subject to later
revision by administrative officers, the application for
judicial review does not present a case or controversy
under the Constitution. In Fidelity Nat'l Bank v. Swope,
274 U. S. 123, this Court held that an intermediate judi-

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.

279 U. S.

cial review of administrative proceedings to be followed
by further administrative action constituted a case or controversy where the decision formed a final basis for further
administrative action, although the administrative officials
were at liberty to discontinue all proceedings. If we may
accept that decision as authority for the rule that application for judicial review of administrative action does not
fail to present a case or controversy merely because the
administrative officers may do nothing further, the fact
that the President may decline to approve the findings of
the Tariff Commission is not fatal to the contention that
the appeal to the Court of Customs Appeals presented a
judicial case.

If the Court holds that there was no case or controversy,
it need not inquire whether the Court of Customs Appeals
is a constitutional court, because § 316 confers jurisdiction

on this Court to review by certiorari, and that provision
is void if there is no case or controversy, and we can not
assume that Congress would have granted these powers
to the Tariff Commission without review by this Court.
The result would be that all the provisions of § 316 must
stand or fall together. If it is concluded that there was
a case of controversy, there may be no occasion to inquire
whether the Court of Customs Appeals is a constitutional
court.
The Court of Customs Appeals is a constitutional court.
If the intention of Congress is a test, that intention is
fully disclosed by its treatment of the subject, including
its assumption that the judges have life tenure. If the
jurisdiction conferred on the court is the test, it is fulfilled, because its jurisdiction has been limited to reviewing decisions of the Customs Court as to classification
of imported merchandise and raising of duty under the
Tariff Acts, and these are questions arising under the
laws of the United States and within the judicial power
defined in Article III of the Constitution. Its jurisdiction is not limited to cases arising in Territories or the
District of Columbia, but extends throughout the States.
The addition to its jurisdiction of appeals from the Tariff
Commission would still leave it with jurisdiction only of
cases arising under the laws of the United States.
The difference between constitutional courts, and legislative courts established pursuant to those clauses in the
Constitution authorizing Congress to govern the territories and the District of Columbia, has been dealt with
in the following cases: Keller v. Potomac Electric Co.,

MR. JusTIcE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a petition for a writ of prohibition to the Court
of Customs Appeals prohibiting it from entertaining an
appeal from findings of the Tariff Commission in a proceeding begun and conducted under § 316 of the Tariff
Act of 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 943; §§ 174-179, Title 19,
U. S. C. A rule to show cause was issued; return was
made to the rule; and a hearing has been had on the
petition and return.
Section 316 of the Tariff Act is long and not happily
drafted. A summary of it will suffice for present purposes.
It is designed to protect domestic industry and trade
against "unfair methods of competition and unfair acts"
in the importation of articles into the United States,
and in their sale after importation. To that end it empowers the President, whenever the existence of any such
unfair methods or acts is established to his satisfaction,
to deal with them by fixing an additional duty upon the
importation of the articles to which the unfair practice
relates, or, if he is satisfied the unfairness is extreme, by
directing that the articles be excluded from entry.
The section provides that, "to assist the President" in
making decisions thereunder, the Tariff Commission shall
investigate allegations of unfair practice, conduct hearings, receive evidence, and make findings and recommendations, subject to a right in the importer or con-

EX PARTE BAKELITE CORP'N.

signee, if the findings be against him, to appeal to the
Court of Customs Appeals on questions of law affecting
the findings. There is also a provision purporting to subject the decision of that court to review by this Court
upon certiorari. Ultimately the commission is required
to transmit its findings and recommendations, with a
transcript of the evidence, to the Presi.dent so that he may
consider the matter and act thereon.
A further provision declares that "any additional duty
or any refusal of entry under this section shall continue
in effect until the President shall find and instruct the
Secretary of the Treasury that the conditions which led
to the assessment of such additional duty or refusal of
entry no longer exist."
The present petitioner, the Bakelite Corporation, desiring to invoke action under that section, filed with the
Tariff Commission a sworn complaint charging unfair
methods and acts in the importation and subsequent sale
of certain articles and alleging a resulting injury to its
domestic business of manufacturing and selling similar
articles. The commission entertained the complaint, gave
public notice thereof and conducted a hearing, in which
interested importers appeared and presented evidence
claimed to be in refutation of the charge. The commission made findings sustaining the charge and recommended that the articles to which the unfair practice related be excluded from entry. The importers appealed to
the Court of Customs Appeals, where the Bakelite Corporation challenged the court's jurisdiction on constitutional grounds. The court upheld its jurisdiction and announced its purpose to entertain the appeal. Thereupon
the Bakelite Corporation presented to this Court its petition for a writ of prohibition. Pending a decision on the
petition further proceedings on the appeal have been
suspended.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

The grounds on which the jurisdiction of the Court of
Customs Appeals was challenged in that court, and on
which a writ of prohibition is sought here, are:
1. That the Court of Customs Appeals is an inferior
court created by Congress under section 1 of Article III
of the Constitution, and as such it can have no jurisdiction
of any proceeding which is not a case or controversy
within the meaning of section 2 of the same Article.
2. That the proceeding presented by the appeal from
the Tariff Commission is not a case or controversy in the
sense of that section, but is merely an advisory proceeding in aid of executive action.
The Court of Customs Appeals considered these grounds
in the order just stated and by its ruling sustained the
first and rejected the second. 16 Ct. Cust. Appls. 191,
53 Treasury Decisions 716.
In this Court counsel have addressed arguments not
only to the two questions bearing on the jurisdiction of
the Court of Customs Appeals, but also to the question
whether, if that court be exceeding its jurisdiction, this
Court has power to issue to it a writ of prohibition to
arrest the unauthorized proceedings.
The power of this Court to issue writs of prohibition
never has been clearly defined by statute I or by decisions 2
And the existence of the power in a situation like the
present is not free from doubt. But the doubt need not
be resolved now, for, assuming that the power exists, there
is here, as will appear later on, no tenable basis for exercising it. In such a case it is admissible, and is common
practice, to pass the question of power and to deny the
writ because without warrant in other respects.8

Opinion of the Court.

While Article III of the Constitution declares, in section 1, that the judicial power of the United States shall
be vested in one Supreme Court and in "such inferior
courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and
establish," and prescribes, in section 2, that this power
shall extend to cases and controversies of certain enumerated classes, it long has been settled that Article III does
not express the full authority of Congress to create courts,
and that other Articles invest Congress with powers in
the exertion of which it may create inferior courts and
clothe them with functions deemed essential or helpful in
carrying those powers into execution. But there is a difference between the two classes of courts. Those established under the specific power given in section 2 of Article
III are called constitutional courts. They share in the
exercise of the judicial power defined in that section, can
be invested with no other jurisdiction, and have judges
who hold office during good behavior, with no power in
Congress to provide otherwise. On the other hand, those
created by Congress in the exertion of other powers are
called legislative courts. Their functions always are directed to the execution of one or more of such powers and
are prescribed by Congress independently of section 2 of
Article III; and their judges hold for such term as Congress prescribes, whether it be a fixed period of years or
during good behavior.
The first pronouncement on the subject by this Court
was in American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511,

Congress for the Territory of Florida were drawn in ques93, 102; In re Rice, 155 U. S. 396; In re Huguley Manufacturing Co.,

tion. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said,
p. 546:
"These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in
which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution
on the general government can be deposited. They are
incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts,
created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which
exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which
enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory belonging to the United States.
The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a
part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d
article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress,
in the execution of those general powers which that body
possesses over the territories of the United States."
That ruling has been accepted and applied from that
time to the present in cases relating to territorial courts.'
A like view has been taken of the status and jurisdiction
of the courts provided by Congress for the District of
Columbia. These courts, this Court has held, are created
in virtue of the power of Congress "to exercise exclusive
legislation" over the district made the seat of the government of the United States, are legislative rather than
constitutional courts, and may be clothed with the authority and charged with the duty of giving advisory decisions in proceedings which are not cases or controversies
within the meaning of Article III, but are merely in aid
of legislative or executive action, and therefore outside
the admissible jurisdiction of courts established under
that Article.'

Opinion of the Court.

The United States Court for China and the consular
courts are legislative courts created as a means of carrying into effect powers conferred by the Constitution respecting treaties and commerce with foreign countries.
They exercise their functions within particular districts
in foreign territory and are invested with a large measure of jurisdiction over American citizens in those districts.' The authority of Congress to create them and to
clothe them with such jurisdiction has been upheld by
this Court and is well recognized.7
Legislative courts also may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising
between the government and others, which from their
nature do not require judicial determination and yet are
susceptible of it. The mode of determining matters of
this class is completely within congressional control.
Congress may reserve to itself the power to decide, may
delegate that power to executive officers, or may commit it to judicial tribunals.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

Conspicuous among such matters are claims against the
United States. These may arise in many ways and may
be for money, lands or other things. They all admit of
legislative or executive determination, and yet from their
nature are susceptible of determination by courts; but no
court can have cognizance of them except as Congress
makes specific provision therefor. Nor do claimants have
any right to sue on them unless Congress consents; and
Congress may attach to its consent such conditions as it
deems proper, even to requiring that the suits be brought
in a legislative court specially created to consider them."
The Court of Claims is such a court. It was created,
and has been maintained, as a special tribunal to examine
and determine claims for money against the United
States. This is a function which belongs primarily to
Congress as an incident of its power to pay the debts of
the United States. But the function is one which Congress has a discretion either to exercise directly or to delegate to other agencies.
For sixty-five years following the adoption of the Constitution Congress made it a practice not only to determine
various claims itself but also to commit the determination
of many to the executive departments. In time, as claims
multiplied, that practice subjected Congress and those departments to a heavy burden. To lessen that burden
Congress created the Court of Claims and delegated to it
the examination and determination of all claims within
stated classes.'" Other claims have since been included
in the delegation and some have been excluded. But the
court is still what Congress at the outset declared it

should be--" a court for the investigation of claims
against the United States." The matters made cognizable therein include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination. On the contrary,
all are matters which are susceptible of legislative or
executive determination and can have no other save
under and in conformity with permissive legislation by
Congress.
The nature of the proceedings in the Court of Claims
and the power of Congress over them are illustrated in
McElrath v. United States, 102 U. S. 426, where particular attention was given to the statutory provisions authorizing that court, when passing on claims against the
government, to consider and deternine any asserted setoffs or counter-claims, and directing that all issues of fact
be tried by the court without a jury. The claimant in
that case objected that these provisions were in conflict
with the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, which
preserves the right of trial by jury in suits at common law
where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars.
This Court disposed of the objection by saying (p. 440):
"There is nothing in these provisions which violates
either the letter or spirit of the Seventh Amendment.
Suits against the government in the Court of Claims,
whether reference be had to the claimant's demand, or to
the defence, or to any set-off, or counter-claim which the
government may assert, are not controlled by the Seventh
Amendment. They are not suits at common law within
its true meaning. The government cannot be sued,
except with its own consent. it can declare in what court
it may be sued, and prescribe the forms of pleading and
the rules of practice to be observed in such suits. It may
restrict the jurisdiction of the court to a consideration of
only certain classes of claims against the United States.
Congress, by the act in question, informs the claimant
that if he avails himself of the privilege of suing the

government in the special court organized for that purpose, he may be met with a set-off, counter-claiim or other
demand of the government, upon which judgment may
go against him, without the intervention of a jury, if the
court, upon the whole case, is of opinion that the government is entitled to such judgment. If the claimant avails
himself of the privilege thus granted, he must do so subject to the conditions annexed by the government to the
exercise of the privilege."
While what has been said of the creation and special
function of the court definitely reflects its status as a legislative court, there is propriety in mentioning the fact
that Congress always has treated it as having that status.
From the outset Congress has required it to give merely
advisory decisions on many matters. Under the act creating it all of its decisions were to be of that nature. 1
Afterwards some were to have effect as binding judgments, but others were still to be merely advisory.12 This
is true at the present time. " A duty to give decisions
which are advisory only, and so without force as judicial
judgments, may be laid on a legislative court, but not
on a constitutional court established under Article III."'
In Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697, and again in
In re Sanborn, 148 U. S. 222, this Court plainly was of
opinion that the Court of Claims is a legislative court

specially created to consider claims for money against the
United States, and on that basis distinctly recognized
that Congress may require it to give advisory decisions.
And in United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 144-145, this
Court described it as having all the functions of a court,
but being, as respects its organization and existence, undoubtedly and completely under the control of Congress.
In the present case the court below regarded the recent decision in Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, as disapproving what was said in the cases just cited, and holding that the Court of Claims is a constitutional rather
than a legislative court. But in this Miles v. Graham
was taken too broadly. The opinion therein contains no
mention of the cases supposed to have been disapproved;
nor does it show that this Court's attention was drawn to
the question whether that court is a statutory court or a
constitutional court. In fact, as appears from the briefs,
that question was not mooted. Such as were mooted were
considered and determined in the opinion. Certainly the
decision is not to be taken in this case as disturbing the
earlier rulings or attributing to the Court of Claims a
changed status. Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511.
That court was said to be a constitutional court in
United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 98 U. S. 569,
602-603; but this statement was purely an obiter dictum,
because the question whether the Court of Claims is a
constitutional court or a legislative court was in no way
involved. And any weight the dictum, as such, might
have is more than overcome by what has been said on the
question in other cases where there was need for considering it.
Without doubt that court is a court of the United States
within the meaning of § 375 of Title 28, U. S. C., 5 just
as the superior courts of the District of Columbia are;
but this does not make it a constitutional court.

The authority to create legislative courts finds illustration also in the late Court of Private Land Claims. It
was created in virtue of the power of Congress over the
fulfillment of treaty stipulations; and its special function
was that of hearing and finally determining claims founded
on Spanish or Mexican grants, concessions, etc., and embracing lands within the territory ceded by Mexico to the
United States and subsequently included within the Territories of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah and the States
of Nevada, Colorado and Wyoming." By the treaties of
cession the United States was obligated to inquire into
private claims to lands within the ceded territory and to
respect inviolably those that were valid. Congress at
first entrusted the preliminary inquiry to executive officers
and required that they make reports whereon it could
make the ultimate determinations. This was an admissible mode of dealing with the subject and many
claims were finally determined under it.18 But later on
Congress created the Court of Private Land Claims and
charged it with the duty of examining and adjudicating,
as between claimants and the United States, all claims
not already determined. In Coe v. United States, 155
U. S.76, that court was held to be a legislative court and
the validity of the act creating it was sustained. And
while that case related to lands in a Territory there can
be no real doubt that the same rule would apply were
the lands in a State. The obligation of the United States
would be the same in either case and Congress would
have the same discretion respecting the mode of fulfilling
it. 9 In fact the act creating the court included within
its jurisdiction all claims within three States as well as
those within three Territories, and the court adjudicated

all within these limits that were brought before it within
the periods fixed by Congress.
The Choctaw and Chickasaw Citizenship Court was
another legislative court. It was created to hear and
determine controverted claims to membership in two Indian tribes. The tribes were under the guardianship of
the United States, which in virtue of that relation was
proceeding to distribute the lands and funds of the tribes
among their members. How the membership should be
determined rested in the discretion of Congress. It could
commit the task to officers of the department in charge of
Indian Affairs, to a commission or to a judicial tribunal.
As the controversies were difficult of solution and large
properties were to be distributed, Congress chose to create
a special court and to authorize it to determine the controversies. In Wallace v. Adams, 204 U. S. 415, this was
held to be a valid exertion of authority belonging to Congress by reason of its control over the Indian tribes. And
it is of significance here that in so ruling this Court approvingly cited and gave effect to the opinion of Chief
Justice Taney in Gordon v. United States respecting the
status of the Court of Claims.
Before we turn to the status of the Court of Customs
Appeals it will be helpful to refer briefly to the Customs
Court. Formerly it was the Board of General Appraisers.
Congress assumed to make the board a court by changing
its name. There was no change in powers, duties or personnel."0 The board was an executive agency charged
with the duty of reviewing acts of appraisers and collectors in appraising and classifying imports and in liquidating and collecting customs duties. 1 But its functions,

although mostly quasijudicial, were all susceptible of performance by executive officers and had been performed
by such officers in earlier times.
The Court of Customs Appeals was created by Congress in virtue of its power to lay and collect duties on
imports and to adopt any appropriate means of carrying
that power into execution.22 The full province of the
court under the act creating it is that of determining matters arising between the Government and others in the
executive administration and application of the customs
laws. These matters are brought before it by appeals
from decisions of the Customs Court, formerly called the
Board of General Appraisers. 23 The appeals include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial deteriffination, but only matters the determination of which may
be, and at times has been, committed exclusively to executive officers. True, the provisions of the customs laws
requiring duties to be paid and turned into the Treasury
promptly, without awaiting disposal of protests against

rulings of appraisers and collectors, operate in many instances to convert the protests into applications to refund
part or all of the money paid;24 but this does not make the
matters involved in the protests any the less susceptible of
determination by executive officers.2" In fact their final
determination has been at times confided to the Secretary
of the Treasury, with no recourse to judicial proceedings.2

and of its relation to the executive administration of the
customs laws, shows very plainly that it is a legislative
and not a constitutional court.
Some features of the act creating it are referred to in
the opinion below as requiring a different conclusion; but
when rightly understood they cannot be so regarded.
A feature much stressed is the absence of any provision
respecting the tenure of the judges. From this it is argued that Congress intended the court to be a constitutional one, the judges of which would hold their offices
during good behavior. And in support of the argument it
is said that in creating courts Congress has made it a
practice to distinguish between those intended to be constitutional and those intended to be legislative by making no provision respecting the tenure of judges of the
former and expressly fixing the tenure of judges of the
latter. But the argument is fallacious. It mistakenly
assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other
depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true
test lies in the power under which the court was created
and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there been
any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives
special significance to the absence or presence of a provision respecting the tenure of judges. This may be
illustrated by two citations. The same Congress that
created the Court of Customs Appeals made provision
for five additional circuit judges and declared that they
should hold their offices during good behavior; 27 and yet
the status of the judges was the same as it would have
been had that declaration been omitted. In creating
courts for some of the Territories Congress failed to include a provision fixing the tenure of the judges; 2"but

the courts became legislative courts just as if such a
provision had been included.
Another feature much stressed is a provision purporting to authorize temporary assignments of circuit and
district judges to the Court of Customs Appeals when
vacancies occur in its membership or when any of its
members are disqualified or otherwise unable to act. This
it is said shows that Congress intended the court to be a
constitutional one, for otherwise such assignments would
be inadmissible under the Constitution. But if there be
constitutional obstacles to assigning judges of constitutional courts to legislative courts, the provision cited is
for that reason invalid and cannot be saved on the theory
that Congress intended the court to be in one class when
under the Constitution it belongs in another. Besides,
the inference sought to be drawn from that provision is
effectually refuted by two later enactments-one permitting judges of that court to be assigned from time to
time to the superior courts of the District of Columbia, 9
which are legislative courts, and the other transferring to
that court the advisory jurisdiction in respect of appeals
from the Patent Office which formerly was vested in the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia."0
Another feature to which attention was given is the
denomination of the court as a United States court. That
the court is a court of the United States is plain; but this
is quite consistent with its being a legislative cout.
As it is plain that the Court of Customs Appeals is a
legislative and not a constitutional court, there is no need
for now inquiring whether the proceeding under § 316 of
the Tariff Act of 1922, now pending before it, is a case or
controversy within the meaning of section 2 of Article
