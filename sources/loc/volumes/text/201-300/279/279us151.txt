ITHACA TRUST CO. v. UNITED STATES.

Argument for Petitioner.

ITHACA TRUST COMPAN\Y, EXECUTOR AND
TRUSTEE, v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 267.

Argued February 27, 1929.-Decided April 8, 1929.

1. Where a will makes bequests to charities, to be paid after the death
of the testator's wife from a residuary estate bequeathed to her for
life, and allows the wife to use from the principal any sum "that
may be necessary to suitably maintain her in as much comfort as
she now enjoys," and the income of the estate at the death of the
testator, after paying specific debts and legacies, is more than sufficient to maintain the widow as required, her authority to draw on
the principal, being thus limited by a standard fixed in fact and
capable of being stated in definite terms of money, does riot render
the value of the charitable bequests so uncertain as to prevent their
deduction from gross income, under § 403 (a) (3) of the Revenue
Act of 1918, in computing the estate tax. P. 154.
2. The estate tax being on the act of the testator and not on the receipt of property by legatees, the estate transferred is to be valued
as of the time of the testator's death. P. 155.
3. Therefore, the value of a life estate is to be determined on the
basis of life expectancy as of that time, even though the life tenant
died before the time came for computing and returning the tax. Id.
64 Ct. Cls. 686, reversed.

The value of the bequests was not ascertainable upon
facts known at the time of death. But the .statute and
regulations prescribe the period within which to ascertain
deductions, and the death of the widow within the period
made the value of the bequests definite; and such value
was therefore deductible. First Nat'l Bank v. Snead, 24
F. (2d) 186; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Comm'r of Internal
Revenue, 13 B. T. A. 85. Distinguishing Mitchell v.
United States, 63 Ct. Cls. 613, affirmed, sub nom. Humes
v. United States, 267 U. S. 487.
Solicitor General Mitchell for the United States.
The will, properly construed, placed the residuary estate in the hands of the executrix and the executor, in
trust during the widow's life. Such discretion as existed
in determining the necessity for drawing on the principal
was given not alone to the widow, but to the executor
acting with her. The widow did not have the unrestrained use of the principal, but was limited to such use
as was necessary to maintain her in her accustomed standard of living. Beyond that she could not go, and these
restraints were enforceable in the courts. The findings
of fact as to the widow's standard of living and as to the
amount of the income took the amount of the residuary
bequest out of the field of mere speculation and afforded a
reasonable basis for determining its value and amount.
On this point our views differ with the Court of Claims
and with those of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, as
disclosed by its regulations, and accord with those of the
Circuit Court of Appeals in First Nat'l Bank v. Snead,
24 F. (2d) 186.
As a practical matter, there are more uncertainties as
to the real value of a bequest to charity in an individual
case when determined by mortality tables than there was
in this case as to the extent to which the power to use

the principal might operate to diminish the charitable
bequest. This point of view is supported by Herron v.
Heiner, 24 F. (2d) 745 and the case first cited. Kahn v.
Bowers, 9 F. (2d) 1018, distinguished; s. c., Vol. 5, Am.
Tax Rep. 5888. See also Dugan v. Miles, 292 Fed. 131.
The case of Humes v. United States, 276 U. S. 487, bears
only indirectly on this case, in that the contingencies were
such that there was no basis through the use of mortality
tables or any other reasonable method, for ascertaining
the value of the bequest to charity.
The rights of the parties in regard to the payment of
a tax of this kind are ordinarily to be determined as of
the time of the decedent's death. Howe v. Howe, 179
Mass. 546; McCurdy v. McCurdy, 197 Mass. 248; Hooper
v. Bradford, 178 Mass. 95; In re White's Estate, 208
N. Y. 64. The value of the life estate or remainder interest as of the date of the testator's death was not changed
by subsequent events. See cases supra, and United States
v. Farr'sExecutor, 196 Fed. 996.
It is true that in both Massachusetts and New York,
the taxing statutes expressly authorize the use of mortality tables, but so do the estate tax regulations of the
Treasury Department. See Simpson v. United States,
252 U. S. 547; Cochran v. United States, 254 U. S. 387;
Henry v. United States, 251 U. S. 393; United States v.
Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158; Gleason & Otis, Inheritance Taxation (1925), p. 505; Boston Safe Deposit Co. v.
Nichols, 18 F. (2d) 660.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes alleged
to have been illegally collected under the Revenue Act of
1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, in view of
the deductions allowed by 403 (a) (3), 40 Stat. 1098.
The Court of Claims denied the claim, 64 C. Cls. 686, and
a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U.S.

On June 15, 1921, Edwin C. Stewart died, appointing
his wife and the Ithaca Trust Company executors, and
the Ithaca Trust Company trustee of the trusts created
by his will. He gave the residue of his estate to his wife
for life with authority to use from the principal any sum
"that may be necessary to suitably maintain her in as
much comfort as she now enjoys." After the death of
the wife there were bequests in trust for admitted charities. The case presents two questions the first of which
is whether the provision for the maintenance of the wife
made the gifts to charity so uncertain that the deduction
of the amount of those gifts from the gross estate under
§ 403 (a) (3), supra, in order to ascertain the estate tax,
cannot be allowed. Humes v. United States, 276 U. S.
487, 494. This we are of opinion must be answered in the
negative. The principal that could be used was only so
much as might be necessary to continue the comfort then
enjoyed. The standard was fixed in fact and capable of
being stated in definiteterms of money. It was not left
to the widow's discretion. The income of the estate at
the death of the testator, and even after debts and specific
legacies had been paid, was more thal sufficient to maintain the widow as required. There was no uncertainty
appreciably greater than the general uncertainty that attends human affairs.
The seconid question is raised by the accident of the
widow having died within the year granted by the statute, § 404, and regulations, for filing the return showing
the deductions allowed by § 403, the value of the net
estate and the tax paid or payable thereon. By § 403
(a) (3) the net estate taxed is ascertained by deducting,
among other things, gifts to charity such as were made
in this case. But as those gifts were subject to the life
estate of the widow, of course their value was diminished
by the postponement that would last while the widow

lived. The question is whether the amount of the diminution, that is, the length of the postponement, is to be
determined by the event as it turned out, of the widow's
death within six months, or by mortality tables showing
the probabilities as they stood on the day when the
testator died. The first impression is that it is absurd to
resort to statistical probabilities when you know the fact.
But this is due to inaccurate thinking. The estate so
far as may be is settled as of the date of the testator's
death. See Hooper v. Bradford, 178 Mass. 95, 97. The
tax is on the act of the testator not on the receipt of
property by the legatees. Young Men's Christian Association v. Davis, 264 U. S. 47, 50; Knowlton v. Moore,
178 U. S. 41, 49, and passim; New York Trust Co. v.
Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 348, 349; Edwards v. Slocum, 264
U. S. 61. Therefore the value of the thing to be taxed
must be estimated as of the time when the act is done.
But the value of property at a given time depends upon
the relative intensity of the social desire for it at that
time, expressed in the money that it would bring in the
market. See International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky,
234 U. S. 216, 222. Like all values, as the word is used
by the law, it depends largely on more or less certain
prophecies of the future; and the value is no less real at
that time if later, the prophecy turns out false than when
it comes out true. See Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction
Co., 275 U. S. 243, 247. New York v. Sage, 239 U. S. 57,
61. Tempting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities
by the now certain fact, we are of opinion that it cannot be done, but that the value of the wife's life interest
must be estimated by the mortality tables. Our opinion
is not changed by the necessary exceptions to the general
rule specifically made by the Act.
Judgment reversed.
