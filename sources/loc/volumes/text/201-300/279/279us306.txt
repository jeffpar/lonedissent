COMPARIA GENERAL De TABACOS DE FILIPINAS
v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS.

No. 335.

Argued March 1, 1929.-Decided April 8, 1929.

1. Under § 10 of the Philippine Income Tax Law (Act 2833, March
7, 1919, as amended by Act 2926, March 20, 1920) imposing a tax
upon income received from sources within the Philippine Islands by
foreign corporations doing business there, income derived from the
sale of goods exported from the Islands and sold in the United
States is "from sources within the Philippine Islands" and properly taxed as such, where the sales are made subject to confirmation
and absolute control as to price and other terms and conditions by
the Philippine office, and the confirmation is given by that office
direct to the buyer or is otherwise the final act consummating the
sales. P. 308.
2. In a suit to recover income taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted under § 10 of the Philippine Income Tax Law, imposing a tax
upon income derived from sources within the Philippine Islands by
foreign corporations doing business there, this Court will not construe a stipulation reciting that the income in question was from
goods "sold" in the United States to mean that the income was not
from sources within the Philippines and not subject to tax, where
the phraseology of the stipulation is ambiguous and fails to disclose
precisely how the business was done. P. 309.
3. The burden is on him who seeks the recovery of a tax already paid
to establish those facts which show its invalidity. P. 310.
4. The judgment of a territorial court on questions of fact or of local
law will be reversed only upon a clear showing of error. P. 310.

alleged to have been illegally exacted.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. William Cattron Rigby, Judge Advocate, with
whom Messrs. Edward A. Kreger, Judge Advocate General, U. S. A., and Delfin Jaranilla,Attorney General of
the Philippine Islands, were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner, a Spanish corporation, brought suit in the
Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, to recover
income taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted.
Judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Supreme
Court of the Philippine Islands. Vol. XXVI, Philippine
Official Gazette, No. 65, May 31, 1928, p. 1712. This
Court granted certiorari October 22, 1928, 278 U. S. 591,
under § 7 of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat.
936, 940.
The tax was assessed under § 10 of the Philippine Income Tax Law of March 7, 1919, Act 2833, 14 Pub. Laws,
P. I. 221, as amended by Act 2926, March 20, 15 Pub.
Laws, P. I. 260, which imposed a tax of 3% annually
.. . upon the total net income received in the preceding
calendar year from all sources within the Philippine
Islands by every corporation . . . organized . . . under
the laws of any foreign country . . ." The case was tried
on an agreed statement of facts and the question presented is whether the profit or income, upon which the
tax now in question was assessed, was received from
"sources within the Philippine Islands" within the meaning of the statute.
The stipulated facts are: That petitioner, a foreign corporation, was licensed to do business in the Philippine
Islands and there maintained its principal office and did
most of its business; that it owmed in the Islands various
sugar and oil mills and tobacco factories and was there
engaged in buying, selling and exporting these products;
that, acting through its Philippine branch, petitioner from
time to time during 1922 exported from the Philippine

Islands to the United States tobacco, sugar, copra and
cocoanut oil, produced, manufactured or purchased by it
in the Philippine Islands; that this merchandise ". . . was
sold in the United States by the agency therein of the
plaintiff's Philippine branch, the sale being subject to
confirmation and absolute control as to price and other
terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine
branch; and that from such transactions . . . the plaintiff
. ," which was ". .. accounted for
made a profit
by the plaintiff on its books of account kept in the Philippine Islands as earnings made by and accruing to the
Philippine branch . . ." It was this net profit on which
the tax was levied.
Petitioner insists that, as the stipulation recites that
the merchandise was "sold" in the United States, the
profit derived from the sales was not from sources within
the Philippine Islands and was, therefore, not subject to
the tax. Section 10 of the Philippine Act is substantially
similar to the corresponding section of the United States
Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, § 10, 39 Stat.
756, 765, and, in support of its position, petitioner cites
opinions of the Attorney General of the United States
ruling that a profit made by a foreign corporation from the
sale in other countries, of merchandise produced or purchased in the United States was not taxable income " from
sources within the United States" under the latter Act,
and the similar provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1917,
October 3, 1917, c. 63, § 1206, 40 Stat. 300, 333, and of
1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, § 233, 40 Stat. 1057,
1077. See opinions of the Aftorney General of January
21, 1924, 34 Ops. A. G. 93, and of November 3, 1920, 32
Ops. A. G. 336. These opinions were accepted and applied by Treasury Decision 3576, Cunm. Bull. 111-1-211,
and Treasury Decision 3111, 4 Cum. Bull. 280. See also

Opinion of the Court.

Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 841; R. J. Dorn & Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B. T. A. 1102, 0. D. 651, 3 Cum. Bull. 265.
While the stipulation states that the merchandise was
"sold" in the United States by petitioner's agency there,
'this statement cannot be taken without qualification;
it must be read with the limitation immediately following, that such sales were "subject to confirmation and
absolute control as to price and other terms and conditions" by petitioner'A Philippine branch. It does not
appear whether the confirmation was, in each case, given
by the Philippine branch direct to the buyer or was otherwise the final act consummating the sales within the
Philippine Islands, or whether, as the trial court and
petitioner seem to have assumed, it was a mere approval
or ratification of the negotiations had by petitioner's
American agent, and authority to him to confirm or otherwise complete the sales in the United States. Certainly,
if the former, the final acts of petitioner making effective
the sales, which were the source of the profit, took place in
the Philippine Islands as an incident to and part of its
business conducted there. See Holder v. Aultman, 169
U. S. 81, 89; Lloyd Thomas Co. v. Grosvenor, 144 Tenn.
349; Charles A. Stickney Co. v. Lynch, 163 Wis. 353;
Shuenfeldt v. Junkermann, 20 Fed. 357.
If, in fact, the sales were thus made in the Philippine
Islands, we think it unimportant whether the merchandise
sold was exported before or after its sale; it could not
be seriously contended, and indeed petitioner does not
contend, that a profit derived from such transactions would
not be subject to the tax. For, in such a case, the entire
transaction resulting in a profit, with the exception of
the negotiations in the United States preceding the sale,
would have taken place in the Philippines. Instead, petitioner asks us to construe the stipulation so as to bring it
within the ruling of the Attorney General applied to a
state of facts where every act effecting the sale took place

outside the taxing jurisdiction. The ambiguous phraseology of the stipulation failing to disclose precisely how
the business was done, we may not speculate as to its
actual character. See Cochranv. United States, 254 U. S.
387, 393.
The burden is on him who seeks the recovery of a tax
already paid, to establish those facts which show its invalidity. United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 428;
Fidelity Title Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 304, 306.
Further, in the absence of a clear showing of error, this
Court should be slow to reverse the judgment of a territorial court on questions of fact or of local law. Villanueva v. Villanueva, 239 U. S. 293, 298; Fox v. Haarstick,
156 U. S. 674, 679. For the reason indicated, the stipulation here does not sustain the burden resting on petitioner.
We need not consider petitioner's contention that the
taxing act, when applied to sales outside the Philippine
Islands, conflicts with the " equal protection" clause of
the Philippine Organic Law. This argument presupposes
that the sales were so made, an assumption which, as
already stated, we cannot make.
