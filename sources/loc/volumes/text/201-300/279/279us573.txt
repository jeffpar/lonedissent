LUCAS, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v.
ALEXANDER ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 481.

Argued April 12, 1929.--Decided May 20, 1929.

1. A respondent in certiorari who did not seek review for himself is
not entitled to question the correctness of the decree of the court
below. P. 576.
2. Semble that the amount realized by an insured, over and above
premiums paid, when, by exercising an option in his policy, he receives in his lifetime the amount of the policy plus accumulated
dividends, is within the provisions of § 213 of the Revenue Act
of 1918 taxing "gains or profits and income derived from any
source whatever," and not exempted as such by any other provision of the Act. Id.
3. That part of the gain so received which is attributable to and
accrued during the period before the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment (February 25, 1913), and of the first law taxing
the income of indivduals (March 1, 1913), must be deemed an
accretion to capital not taxable by the income tax acts enacted
after the Amendment. P. 577.
4. In determining what part of such total gain accrued to the taxpayer after March 1, 1913, provisions of the taxing statute enacted
as aids in arriving at the answer must be so construed as to avoid
doubts as to its constitutionality. Id.
5. The purpose of ascertaining the value of a taxpayer's property
on March 1, 1913, (Revenue Act of 1918, § 202 (A)(1),) is to
measure that part of his total gain which had arisen or accrued
after the enactment of any of the statutes taxing income, and thus
to arrive at his gain taxed as income. Value as of that date may
be disregarded unless it serves that purpose. P. 578.
6. In applying § 202(A) (1) to an insurance policy having no market
value, which was liquidated by the insured, its value on March 1,
1913, need not be determined by making a prediction as of that
time based upon an estimate of future possibilities; the 1913 value
is at most but a method of allocating a known income to the periods
in which it actually accrued. P. 579.

7. The taxpayer insured his life in 1899 under deferred dividend
policies which he fully paid up by 1908. Dividends were payable
only if he were living and the policies in force twenty years from
date of issue. At the end of that period (1919), exercising an option, he discontinued the insurance and received the face value
of the policies and the accumulated dividends. Held, construing
and applying § 202(A) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1918,
(1) That the value of the policies as of March 1, 1913, was
not their cash-surrender or loan value on that date, nor wa the
taxable gain the amount by which the proceeds of the policies
exceeded the total premiums paid. P. 578.
(2) That, (upon the evidence presented and for the purposes
of this case) the value which had accrued on March 1, 1913,
could be taken as the total of the insurance reserve liability and
dividend accumulations provisionally apportioned to the policies
on the company's books at that date. P. 580.
27 F. (2d) 237, affirmed.

Certiorari, 278 U. S. 594, to review a judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed a judgment recovered by A. J. A. Alexander in the District Court, 21 F.
(2d) 68, in an action for money illegally collected as
income taxes. The present respondents were substituted
in this Court, as executors, after the plaintiff's death.
Assistant Attorney General Wilebrandt, with whom
Attorney General Mitchell, and Messrs. J. Louis Monarch
and Edwin G. Davis were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Elwood Hamilton, with whom Mr. George V. Triplett was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case is here on certiorari, granted November 19,
1928, 278 U. S. 594, to review a judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth- Circuit, 27 F. (2d) 237, affirming a

nal Revenue of federal income taxes alleged to have been
illegally exacted.
On May 19, 1899, respondents' testator procured two
life insurance policies for $50,000 each upon his own life
and payable to his estate. On May 19, 1908, they became
fully paid up policies, upon the payment of the last of
ten annual premiums aggregating, for both policies,
$78,100. Each policy stipulated that in the event of death
within ten years the amount payable should be $50,000
and, from the eleventh to the twentieth year inclusive,
an annually increasing amount ranging from $50,700 in
the eleventh year to $72,150 in the twentieth year. The
death benefit on each policy during the year ending May
19, 1913, was $59,300. The policies participated in the
surplus of the company and "dividends" properly allocable to each were set aside or ascertainable on its books
each year, but were payable only at the end of the tontine
period of twenty years and only to holders of policies still
in force at that time.
The insured was given an option at the end of the
period of receiving on each policy the sum of $50,000
"and in addition the cash dividend then apportioned by
the company." The insured elected to exercise this option
May 19, 1919, receiving as proceeds of the two policies
$120,797, representing $100,000 face value plus $20,797
dividends. The gain to him over his total premium expenditure was thus $42,697. The Commissioner assessed
this amount as taxable income under the Revenue Act of
1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057.
Both the district court and the court of appeals thought
that, under § 202a(I) of the Act, only so much of the
proceeds of the policies as exceeded their value on March
1, 1913, was subject to tax. They found that the amount
provisionally set aside by the company as surplus accum-

ulations applicable to the two policies on that date was
$13,600, and that it was then evident that the rate of
accumulation, although not certain, would probably be
greater during the later years of the tontine period than
before March 1, 1913. Even at the same rate, the accumulation at the end of the period would amount to
$19,428.57. Both courts, therefore, concluded that the
insured might reasonably have anticipated that the policies would have .been worth on their maturity date, if
then in force, their face value plus the anticipated accumulations, or a total for both policies of $119,428.57.
Since, under the sliding scale, the death benefits would
have been even proportionately larger had the insured
died before the end of the period, they decided that the
combined value of the policies on March 1, 1913, was the
smaller amount discounted at the rate of 4% compounded
annually to that date, or $93,587.81. The taxable gain
on the policies, accordingly, was taken to be the difference
between this amount and the actual proceeds .of the policies, or $27,209.19. A recovery was allowed of the difference between the tax as assessed and that as computed
on the gain afterMarch 1, 1913, so ascertained.
As respondents did not ask certiorari, we may disregard
their argument that the judgment below was erroneous
in that the proceeds of an insurance policy paid to the
insured are not taxable income except as the determination of that question may be involved in passing upon the
assignments of error of petitioner. See Federal Trade
Commission v. Pacific Paper Ass'n., 273 U. S. 52, 66.
By the expenditure of $78,100 in premiums, the insured
secured a return of $120,797, -resulting in an economic
and realized money gain to him of $42,697. The question
of liability for the tax on this gain is different from that
mooted by counsel, but not decided, in United States v.
Supplee-Biddle Hardware Co., 265 U. S. 189, 194, which

LUCAS v. ALEXANDER.

Opinion of the Court.

was whether insurance upon the life of a corporate officer,
paid at his death to the corporation, could be constitutionally subjected to a tax on income. Here the amount
paid was not a death benefit or in the nature of a gift to a
beneficiary and was in no sense an indemnity for, or repayment of, an economic loss suffered by the insured, but
was a profit or gain upon his premium investment, and
would seem to be plainly embraced within the provisions
of § 213 taxing "gains or profits and income derived from
any source whatever" and not exempted as such from
tax by any other provision of the Act. See Penn.Mutual
Co. v. Lederer, 252 U. S. 523, 532, 534; Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207; Merchants' Loan & Trust
Co. v. Smietanka 255 U. S. 509, 518.
But of this total gain received by the insured, a part is
attributable to and accrued during the period before the
effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment (February 25,
1913), and of the first law taxing the income of individuals (March 1, 1913), and hence, for income tax purposes,
must be deemed an accretion to capital not taxable by the
income tax acts enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment.
See Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 334; cf.
Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179; Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221. Whether or not such accretions may
be constitutionally subjected to tax, we have no occasion
to decide. The present Act, at least, does not attempt it.
But the question presented necessarily involves a determination of what part of the total gain received by the
taxpayer accrued to him after March 1, 1913. In answering it, provisions of the taxing statute enacted as aids in
arriving at the answer must be construed with an eye to
possible constitutional limitations so as to avoid doubts
as to its validity. United States v. Delaware & Hudson
Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407, 408; United States v. Standard
Brewery, 251 U. S. 210, 220; Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R.

110, 114; PanamaR. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 390.
Section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides:
"(A) That for the purpose of ascertaining the gain
derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition
of property, real, personal, or mixed, the basis shall be:
"(1) In the case of property acquired before March 1,
1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of
that date."
The Government insists that the policies, being nonassignable except to persons having an insurable interest
in the life of the insured, had no market price and their
combined value as of March 1, 1913 did not exceed their
loan or cash surrender value on that date, which alone
could be realized on them, of $74,600, Regulations 45
(1920) Art. 87, and that any greater value assigned to
them as of that date must be rejected as contingent and
speculative. But in view of the provisions of § 213b(2)
of the Act, see Regulations 45 (1920) Art. 72(b), exempting from taxation the return of premiums on the maturity
of the policy, it concedes that the taxable gain of the
insured may be taken at the amount, fixed by the commissioner, by which the proceeds of the policies exceeded
$78,100, the total premiums paid.
Plainly, in the present case, the $42,697 gained over
premium cost of the two policies, which accrued to the
taxpayer through a period of twenty years, did not all
accrue in the six years following March 1, 1913. If the
value on that date, for the purpose of ascertaining taxable
gain, was greater than the total premium expenditure
which had been completed more than four years before,
there is no reasonable basis for determining the taxable
gain which accrued after March 1, 1913, by deducting from
the total amount received the total premium payments.
Nor can we accept the contention of the Government
that the value of the policies on March 1, 1913, did not

LUCAS v. ALEXANDER.
573

Opinion of the Court.

exceed their loan value as of that date. The purpose of
ascertaining the value of the taxpayer's property on
March 1, 1913 is, as § 202 states, to measure that part of
his total gain wh'ch has arisen or accrued after the enactment of any of the statutes taxing income and thiis to
arrive at his gain which may be taxed as income. Lynch
v. Turrish, supra. Value as of that date may be disregarded unless it serves that purpose. United States v.
Flannery, 268 U. S. 98; Goodrich v. Edwards, 255 U. S.
527; Walsh v. Brewster, 255 U. S. 536.
Under the statute, market price of the taxpayer's property on that date, where ascertainable, may be resorted to
as generally a sufficiently definite and trustworthy gauge
of the gain which has later accrued. But where the property has no market value, the statute must be interpreted
in the light of its purpose to ascertain taxable gains accruing since March 1, 1913. Hence, in such a case, its fair
value on the critical date is not necessarily what might
have been realized upon it by a forced liquidation by accepting the unfavorable loan or cash surrender value.
Having in mind the purpose of the statute, we think it
must be taken rather to be that part of the amount actually realized by the taxpayer which, by the use of appropriate accounting methods, can fairly be said to have accrued before March 1, 1913-its value then as compared
with the value in fact later realized by the taxpayer taken
as a standard.
In applying § 202a(1) to an insurance policy having no
market value, we are not required either by circumstances
or any positive provision of statute to determine its value
on March 1, 1913, by making a prediction as of that time
based upon an estimate of future possibilities, as is the case
in valuing for purposes of inheritance tax an interest of
uncertain duration passing at the death of the testator.

OCTOBER TERM, 1928.
Opinion of the Court.

279 U. S.

There the value as of the date of death is the very thing
taxed and can usually be determined only by speculation
as to future events. Here, 1913 value is at most merely
a method of allocating a known income to the periods
in which it actually accrued. It is never necessary to
speculate, as did the court below, as to what might later
be realized from his property by the taxpayer, nor as to
what might have been realized ift on March 1, 1913, he had
made some forced disposition of the property which
would have precluded any taxable gain. For the necessity of ascertaining value as of March 1, 1913, can never
arise until some later date when income has been produced
by converting the property into money or money's worth
and the amount actually realized is known, and then, as
we have said, only for the purpose of apportioning the
total gain which has accrued between fhe periods before
and after March 1, 1913.
It is familiar knowledge that' the source of dividend accumulations upon insurance policies is interest upon investments of the company and savings effected from estimated future expenses and from death payments covered
by premiums, with appropriate "loadings" to give a margin of safety, which the policy holders have paid. In
accordance with the usual practice of life insurance companies, under the system of accounting employed by the
insurer in the present case, the amount of reserve set
aside by the company to meet its policy liability and dividend accumulations provisionally apportioned to each
policy was ascertained or ascertainable on the books of the
company at the end of each year. During the policy year
which included March 1, 1913, the insurance reserve i,
bility thus ascertained on each of the present policies was
$40,600 and the dividend accumulation on each, which
both courts below found had accrued on March 1, 1913,
was $6,800, making a total of reserve and accumulations
applicable to each policy of $47,400. These items with
subsequent annual additions totaled at the maturity of

LUCAS v. ALEXANDER.
573

Opinion of the Court.

each policy, for the former $50,000 and for the latter
$10,398.50 which, taken together, made up the total payment received by the taxpayer on each policy. They constitute a complete record and determination of the actual
economic-gain annually accruing upon the policies which
was ultimately realized by the taxpayer and they provide an
adequate basis for ascertaining the proportion of the total
value realized which had accrued on March 1, 1913. The
sum of the insurance reserve liability and the dividend
aocumulations provisionally apportioned to the two policies on March 1, 1913, their accrued value on that date,
was $94,800. As that valuation is larger than that found
by either of the lower courts and is supported by reliable
data, we may, in the absence of other evidence, accept it as
sufficiently establishing that the value found below was
not more than that required to be ascertained by the statute and so did not prejudice the rights of petitioner. It
is unnecessary to consider the question mooted whether
upon other evidence, not here presented, a larger value as
of March 1, 1913, might have been found.
The court below, by discounting the total estimated
value of the policies at their maturity at 4%, arrived at a
rough approximation of their accrued value on that date.
This method, however, did not ascertain that value or
the taxable gain with accuracy, since it was based on an
assumed instead of the actual value of the policies at maturity. It discounted the assumed value at a flat rate of
interest instead of at that actually earned, and it left out
of account savings from estimated expenses and death
losses which, as well as actual interest earned, were taken
into account in determining dividend accumulations annually ascertained and credited to the policies on the
books of the company. But, as the accuracy of the computation is not questioned here, and as it gave a result of
which petitioner cannot complain, the judgment will be
Affirmed.
