LEONARD v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 183. Argued January 17, 1929.-Decided February 18, 1929.
1. In the Act of June 10, 1922, which adjusts the base pay of officers
of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, according to rank and
length of service, the clause in § 1 providing that "For officers
in the service on June 30, 1922, there shall be included in the computation all service which is now counted in computing longevity
pay," refers only to officers who were in active service on that
date. P. 44.
2. The Act to equalize pay of retired officers, approved May 8, 1926,
in providing that the pay of officers retired on or before June 30,
1922, shall not be less than that of officers of equal rank and length
of service retired subsequent to that date, contemplates that the
standard of comparison in each case shall be an officer continually
in active service until his retirement after that date, and does
not operate to extend to officers retired before June 10, 1922, the
benefits of the clause from the Act of that date quoted supra,
par. 1. P. 45.
3. An officer of the Marine Corps who retired in 1911, and, under
the Act of March 2, 1903, received longevity pay for his retired
service because the retirement was on account of wounds received
in battle, held not entitled, under the Acts of June 10, 1922, and
May 8, 1926, to have the years spent by him on the retired list
counted in determining his base pay period. P. 45.

Opinion of the Court.

Solicitor General Mitchell and Assistant Attorney
General Galloway submitted for the United States.
Mr. JusTIcE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case is here on writ of certiorari, granted October
8, 1928, under § 3 (b) of the Act of February 13, 1925, to
review a judgment of the Court of Claims, 64 Ct. Cls. 384,
denying recovery of additional pay claimed to be due to
petitioner as a major in the Marine Corps on the retired
list. Petitioner, because of wounds received in battle,
was retired on September 30, 1911, when his active service
was a little more than thirteen years. He was later, at
various times, detailed to active duty, making his total
active service, both before and after his retirement, more
than seventeen years. His service, both active and retired, amounted to more than twenty-seven years at the
time this suit was brought. The question presented is
whether the Court of Claims correctly held that the years
spent by him in inactive service on the retired list could
not be counted in determining the amount of his base or
period pay as an officer on the retired list.
The pay and allowances of officers of the Marine Corps,
and provisions for their retirement, are in general the
same as those of like grades in the Army. R. S. §§ 1612,
1622. Under R. S. § 1274, officers retired from active
service are entitled to receive 75% of the pay "of the
rank upon which they are retired." Before the Act of
June 10, 1922, c. 212, 42 Stat. 625, officers in the Army
received pay based upon rank, $2,500 a year in the case
of a major, R. S. § 1261, increased to $3,000 by Act of
May 11, 1908, c. 163, 35 Stat. 106, 108, and a certain additional amount, termed "longevity pay," based on length
of service. R. S. §§ 1262, 1263, and Act of June 30, 1882,
c. 254, 22 Stat. 117, 118.
In United States v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 244, decided in the
October term, 1881, this Court held that under the appli-

cable statutes a retired army officer was entitled to count
the period during which he had been on the retired list in
computing longevity pay. The effect of this decision was
modified by the Act of March 2, 1903, c. 975, 32 Stat. 927,
932, which provided that "except in case of officers retired on account of wounds received in battle," officers
then or later retired should not receive further increases in
longevity pay for retired service. Under these provisions
the petitioner was entitled, after his retirement in 1911,
to 75% of the base pay of a major, $3,000 a year, and as
his retirement was because of wounds received in battle,
he was permitted by the Act of 1903 to count his period
of retirement in determining the airhount of his longevity
pay.
By the Act of June 10, 1922,1 revising generally the
scheme of service pay, a new schedule of base and longevity pay was adopted. The amount of base pay was
fixed with reference to specified pay periods and was made
to depend both upon rank and length of service. Under
it majors who had completed fourteen years of service
were to receive fourth period pay of $3,000 per annum,

and majors of twenty-three years of service fifth period
pay of $3,500. It also provided that an officer should
receive an increase of 5% of the base pay of his period for
each three years of service up to thirty years, with certain
limitations not now important.
As this Act, effective July 1, 1922, provided that it
should not operate to authorize an increase or decrease
in the pay of officers on the retired list on June 30, 1922,
the petitioner continued after its enactment, as before, to
be entitled to base pay of $3,000 a year as fixed by the
Act of May 11, 1908, and to longevity pay as fixed by
other applicable provisions of the statutes. But by the
Act of May 8, 1926, c. 274, 44 Stat. 417, enacted "to
equalize the pay of retired officers," the benefits of the
Act of June 10, 1922, were to some extent extended to
officers retired on or before June 30, 1922, by proviling
that the retired pay of such officers should not be less
than that provided for "officers . . . of equal rank and
length of service retired subsequent to that date."
Petitioner has received longevity pay as a major of
twenty-seven years service, his right to which is not
three years of service up to thirty years: . . . Nothing contained in
the first sentence of Section 17 or in any other section of this Act
shall authorize an increase in the pay of officers or warrant officers
on the retired list on June 30, 1922.
For officers appointed on and after July 1, 1922, no service shall
be counted for purposes of pay except active commissioned service
under a Federal appointment and commissioned service in the National Guard when called out by order of the President. For officers
in the service on June 30, 1922, there shall be included in the computation all service which is now counted in computing longevity
pay .. .
Sec. 17. That on and after July 1, 1922, retired officers and warrant officers shall have their retired pay, or equivalent pay, computed
as now authorized by law on the basis of pay provided in this Act:

the present pay of officers . . . now on the retired list ...

contested. He has also received 75% of the base pay for
the fourth period as prescribed by the Act of June 10,
1922, for a major of more than fourteen years service.
If entitled to base pay calculated on the twenty-seven
years of his total active anti inactive service, he should
receive, under the provisions of the 1926 Act, the benefit
of the higher pay of the fifth period, 75% of the difference
between this pay and the base pay for the fourth period
being the amount involved in the present suit.
It is not denied that petitioner should be allowed to
count his entire period of active service, including that
since his retirement, of more than seventeen years, which
would entitle him to pay of the fourth period which he
is now receiving, and it is argued by petitioner that the
benefits of the Act of June 10, 1922, which by the Act
of May 8, 1926y were extended to all retired officers,
include, in the case of petitioner, the right to count inactive service in computing base pay. This claim is based
on the provision of the Act of March 2, 1903, allowing
officers whose retirement was on account of wounds
received in battle, as was petitioner's, to count retired
service in computing longevity pay and on the clause in
the Act of 1922 which provides that "for officers in the
service on June 30, 1922, there shall be included in the
computation all service which is now counted in computing longevity pay."
That this latter clause, when enacted, was intended to
include only officers then in active service is, we think,
apparent on an inspection of the whole 1922 Act. As
already noted, the pay of officers on the retired list
remained unaffected by this legislation at the time of its
enactment. Section 1 expressly stipulated that the act
should not authorize any increase in the pay of officers
already retired on June 30, 1922, and this provision must
be read with the next sentence, save one, on which the
petitioner relies. Having by the first clause excluded

Opinion of the Court.

retired officers from any increase authorized by the act,
the later provision for computing the pay of "officers in
service" by including all service then counted in computing longevity pay must be taken to have referred only to
officers on the active list.
The equalization Act of May 8, 1926, was passed in
order to correct certain inequalities in the pay of retired
officers, due to the fact that the Act of 1922 was not, by
its terms, applicable to officers retired before its effective
date, and also to continue the former policy, exemplified
by R. S. § 1274, of securing to retired officers proportionate benefits of increased pay legislation affecting
officers on the active list. See House Report No. 857,
69th Congress, First Session.
But in carrying out this purpose, the 1926 Act did not
strike down the provision of the 1922 Act expressly
excluding from its benefits officers then retired and, as so
modified, apply it to those officers. Had it done so it
would more certainly have secured to officers retired
before the effective date of the earlier act the benefit of
the clause allowing all service counted in computing
longevity pay to be included in the computation of base
pay. Instead, by its terms, the Act of 1926 implies a
comparison with an officer benefited by the 1922 Act,
that is--so far as the clause of that act in question is
concerned-an officer in active service on July 1, 1922.
Even assuming, as petitioner argues, that under the
provisions of the 1922 Act, an officer then in active service
would be entitled to count prior service while retired on
account of wounds received in battle, in computing his
base pay, which is not free from doubt,2 it seems unlikely
that Congress, by the equalization Act of 1926, meant to
set up as a standard of comparison, a case so exceptional
2The compilers of the U. S. Code regarded the Act of 1903 as
being repealed and consequently as permitting only active service
to be included. See U. S. Code, Tit. 10, See. 683.

as that of an officer reappointed to active service after
being retired, chancing to be engaged in such service on
the operative date of the 1922 Act. It is argued by the
Government that section 24 of the Act of June 4, 1920,
c. 227, 41 Stat. 759, had rendered reappointments from the
retired to the active service (as distinguished from temporary assignments of retired officers to active duty, like that
of petitioner) practically impossible, except by special act
of Congress. The Act is open to such a construction for
it limited the number of commissions permitted in each
rank, provided that vacancies should be filled from senior
active officers of next lower rank and thus semingly terminated the former practice of permitting appointments
to the active service from those on the retired list.
It seems more reasonable to believe that Congress in
general legislation of this character contemplated comparison only to a more universal standard-the normal
case of %n officer continually in active service until his
retirement after July 1, 1922, and that consequently the
1926 Act should not be read to extend to officers retired
before 1922, the 1 enefits of the clause permitting active
officers alone to include all service counted in computing
longevity pay. There is nothing in the 1926 Act expressly
indicating an intention of Congress to allow to an officer
retired in 1911, the same base pay as that given to one who,
appointed at the same time, had continued in active service until after the date of the 1922 Act-which is what
petitioner contends. Moreover, the construction adopted
by us is more in consonance with the policy seemingly
expressed in the amendment to the 1922 Act contained in
the Act of May 26, 1928, c. 787, 45 Stat. 774, that from
and after July 1, 1922, only active service should authorize
increases in the base pay.
On the facts presented we need not decide whether officers in active service on June 30, 1922, and retired after
that date because of wounds received in battle were en-

titled to count such subsequent retired service in computing their base pay.
Recognizing the force of petitioner's argument and that
the number and complexity of the statutes involved and
their inept phrasing leave the question not free from
doubt, we conclude that the construction given to them
by the Court of Claims is the more reasonable one. The
judgment is accordingly
Affirmed.
Mr. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the

should be allowed.

1. When a treaty provision fairly admits of two constructions, one
restricting, the other enlarging, the rights which may be claimed
under it, the more liberal interpretation is to be preferred. P. 52.
2. As the treaty-making power is independent of and superior to
the legislative power of the States, the meaning of treaty provisions liberally construed is not restricted by any necessity of
avoiding possible conflict with state legislation, and when so ascertained must prevail over inconsistent state enactments. P. 52.
3. When the meaning of treaty provisions is uncertain, recourse
may be had to the negotiations and diplomatic correspondence of
the contracting parties relating to the subject matter, and to their
own practical construction of it. P. 52.
