DES MOINES v. CITY RAILWAY CO.
214 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

CITY OF DES MOINES v. DES MOINES CITY RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.
No. 171.

Argued April 21, 22, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.

A resolution of a municipal council, directing a street railway company
to remove and replace tracks and wires, and, in case of failure to
comply, instructing the City Solicitor to take such action as he deems
advisable to enforce the resolution, amounts only to direction to
bring a suit; and, even if contract rights should be violated if the
resolution were enforced, the resolution does not of itself amount
to an ordinance or law impairing the obligation of contracts and the
Circuit Court has no jurisdiction of a suit to enjoin its enforcement.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. William H. Baily, Mr. Howard J. Clark and Mr. William H. Bremner, with whom Mr. R. 0. Brennan was on the
brief, for appellant:
The United States Circuit Court was without jurisdiction
to hear and determine this cause. The question of jurisdiction
precedes any inquiry into the merits. Oregon v. Hitchcock,
202 U. S. 60, 68; Whitney v. Dick, 202 U. S. 132, 135.
The question of jurisdiction was clearly raised and decided
in the court below, and while not referred to in the assignment
of errors, is before this court, and would be even if it had not
been suggested in the court below. Act of March 3, 1875, § 5;
Briggs v. Traders' Company, 135 Fed. Rep. 254, 257; Hartog
v. Memory, 116 U. S. 588; Williams v. Nottawa, 104 U. S. 209211.
Whether a case presents a Federal question must be determined from the allegations of fact in the bill, giving them
their natural and logical meaning and application, without regard to the arguments, conclusions and surmises stated. Devine v. Los Angeles, 202 U. S. 313, 333; Houston & T. C. R. Co.,

Equity, p. 95.
If it appears from the entire record that a case does not
really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy
within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, jurisdiction must
be denied. Morris v. Gilmore, 129 U. S. 315; Wetmore v.
Rymer, 169 U. S. 115, 120; Barrie v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550;

Holden v. Utah M. & M. Co., 82 Fed. Rep. 209; Bank of Arapahoe v. David Bradley & Co., 72 Fed. Rep. 867.
The resolution of the City Council does not infringe the provisions of § 10, Art. I of the Constitution, which is aimed at the
legislative power of the State, and to come within its inhibition
there must be a law of the State or an enactment from some
source to which the State gives the force of law. N. 0. Water

96 U. S. 176, 183; Lehigh Water Company v. Easton, 121 U. S.
388, 392.
If an enactment is susceptible of two meanings, one in conflict with the Constitution and the other not, the court should
adopt the latter. State v. Stevens, 112 Wisconsin, 170; Wheeler

Walnut, 117 Iowa, 629; Zalesky v. CedarRapids, 118 Iowa, 774.
The resolution was not enacted in the manner required for
the enactment of an ordinance, and, therefore, cannot be construed to be an ordinance. Code of Iowa, 1897, §§ 681, 682;
Cape Girardeauv. Foufeu, 30 Mo. App. 511, 556; City of Alma

McQuillin, Mun. Ord., § 2; Strohm v. Iowa City, 47 Iowa, 42.
The contract of the complainant, if it has one, is set forth in
the ordinance, and an ordinance cannot be amended or repealed except by an ordinance, and the resolution is therefore
void as a matter of state law. Code of Iowa, 1897, § 681;
Cascaden v. Waterloo, 106 Iowa, 673, 681; People v. Mount,
186 Illinois, 560, 571.
If the effect of the resolution would be to impair the obligation of contracts, or to deny due process of law or equal protection of law, it contravenes the constitution of Iowa and is
void as a matter of state law. Const. Iowa, Art. I, §§ 9, 21.
If an attempt to legislate is void under the state law no
Federal question arises under it for it is not a law. Gas Light

The resolution does not deny due process of law.
Law in its regular course of administration is due process
and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied. 2 Kent, Com., 13; Davidson v. New

The resolution shows that the city only intended to proceed
by due process of law. Cape May v. Cape May Ry. Co., 60
N. J. Law, 224.
The intention of the council in passing the resolution was to
cause proceedings to be instituted in a court of competent
jurisdiction.
Mr. Nathaniel T. Guernsey, with whom Mr. William L.
Read, Mr. George H. Carr, Mr. Alonzo C. Parker and Mr.
William E. Miller were on the brief, for appellee:
This case presents a Federal question and the jurisdiction
is clear. See Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Duluth, 208 U. S. 583,
which is exactly in point. See also Mercantile Trust Co. v.
Columbus, 203 U. S. 311, 322; Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter,
177 U. S. 507; Saginaw Gas Light Co. v. Saginaw, 28 Fed. Rep.

U. S. 1; Iron Mountain R. Co. v. Memphis, 96 Fed. Rep. 113;
Riverside Ry. Co. v. Riverside, 118 Fed. Rep. 736.
The resolution is a law and its effect is to destroy the appellant's rights. The argument that this enactment should be by
ordinance and that it is merely administrative, is beside the
point as is the argument that the city did not mean what it
said. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Wichita, 123 Fed. Rep. 779.

214 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The effect of this resolution, if it were permitted to stand,
would be to render unlawful the exercise by the complainant
of its rights under this contract.
There is jurisdiction in equity. Resort to equity is proper,
because of the cloud upon the complainant's title, to avoid a
multiplicity of suits, to prevent interference with necessary
extensions, and because damages at law would be clearly inadequate. Blair v. Chicago, 201 U. S. 400, 449; Detroit v.
DetroitCitizens' R. Co., 184 U. S. 368; Cleveland v. City R. Co.,

Co. v. Omaha, 147 Fed. Rep. 1.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill brought in the Circuit Court by an Iowa corporation against a city of Iowa. The ground of jurisdiction is
that a resolution of the City Council of that city is a law impairing the obligation of contracts within the meaning of the
Constitution of the United States, and if carried out will take
the property of the corporation without due process of law,
contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The Circuit Court
granted an injunction against the enforcement of the resolution, and the defendant appealed to this court.
The plaintiff, the appellee, sets up, under a certain ordinance,
a right unlimited as to time to construct, maintain and operate
an electric street railway in and over the streets, alleys and
bridges of Des Moines. The resolution alleged to impair these
rights is as follows:
"Whereas: Questions have been raised as to the rights of
the Des Moines City Railway Company and the Interurban
Railway Company to maintain their tracks and operate their
lines upon and along and over the streets and bridges and public places of the City of Des Moines; and
"Whereas: It is essential to the preservation of the rights of
the City of Des Moines that such questions be determined as
speedily as possible.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

214 U. S.

"Be it Resolved by the City Council of the City of Des
Moines: That said companies be and they are hereby ordered
to remove all of their tracks, poles and wires from the streets,
bridges and public places of the City of Des Moines, and to
restore and repair the surface and pavement where paved of
all of the streets along which they are now operating their
lines, and said companies are hereby ordered to commence said
removal within twenty-five days after the passage of this
resolution.
"Be it Further Resolved: That should the said Railway
Companies fail to commence such removal within the time
above specified, the City Solicitor be and he is hereby instructed to take such action as he shall deem advisable and
necessary to secure the enforcement of the above resolution.
"Be it Further Resolved: That the City Clerk be and he is
hereby instructed to serve a certified copy of this resolution
upon the Des Moines City Railway Company and the Interurban Railway Company forthwith."
We are of opinion that this is not a law impairing the rights
alleged by the appellee, and therefore that the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court cannot be maintained. Leaving on one side
all questions as to what can be done by resolution as distinguished from ordinance under Iowa laws, we read this resolution as simply a denial of the appellee's claim and a direction
to the City Solicitor to resort to the courts if the appellee shall
not accept the city's views. The resolution begins with a recital that questions as to the railway company's rights have
been raised, and ends with a direction to the City Solicitor to
take action to enforce the city's position. The only action to
be expected from a City Solicitor is a suit in court. We cannot take it to have been within the meaning of the direction
to him that he should take a posse and begin to pull up the
tracks. The order addressed to the companies to remove their
tracks was simply to put them in the position of disobedience,
as ground for a suit, if the city was right.
Decree reversed, with direction to dismiss the bill.
