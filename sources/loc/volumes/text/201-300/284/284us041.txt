APPEAL from a decree enjoining the Commission froih

enforcing a privilege tax.
Mr. Edward R. Holmes, Jr., argued the cause for appellants, appearing pro hac vice by leave of Court; and
Messrs. George T. -Mitchell,Attorney General of Mississippi, And J. A. Lauderdale, Assistant Attorney General;
were on the brief.
The New York contracts are simply executory conttacts of sale. The appellee cannot tell what gas it will
sell to the distributor at Woodville, or what gas it will
carry on through Mississippi into Louisiana. None of the
gas is actually sold before it leaves the gas fields in
Louisiana. It is true that the appellee is transporting
gas with a view to selling it, but, before it relinquishes the
title and control of any of it by delivery to the distributor,

it must, under the very terms of its executory contract,
prepare and treat it for sale and delivery. Appellee alone
controls and operates its taps, regulators, thermometers
and meters.
The sale is actually consummated at a time when the
commodity is in Mississippi. This is not case of de-livery of an interstate shipment sent in response to an
order. It is a case where the original package, being
transported in interstate commerce; is broken, and the
-commodity prepared for 'sale and actually sold and
delivered in Mississippi.
The method of measuring -the tax by the number of
miles of pipe line is reasonable. The tax. can be validly
imposed, even though it incidentally and indirectly affect
and burden interstate business. St. Louis 'R. Co. v.

Opinion of the Court.

Hallahan,257 U. S. 277.
Mr. David Clay Bramlette for appellee.

MIR. JusrFc

HOLMEs delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from a decree of three Judges sitting
according to statute in the District Court, by which the
Tax Commission of the State of Mississippi is permanently
enjoined from enforcing a.Privilege Tax Law of that
State, being c. 88 of the laws of 1930, against the Interstate Natural Gas Company, the plaintiff in this suit.
The facts are agreed. The plaintiff has a trunk line of
pipe extending from gas fields in Louisiana through
Mississippi and back to Louisiana; 72.42 miles having a
diameter of 22 inches, 8.11 miles having a diameter of 12
inches and 4.99 miles a diameter of 10 inches. It sells
daily to distributors in Louisiana about 70,000,000 cubic
feet of natural gas in summer and about 75,000,000 feet in"
winter. In Mississippi it sells as will be explained from
204,000 to 520,000 feet according to the season. The gas
flows continuously from the gas fields in Louisiana and
obviously, for much the greater part at least, in interstate commerce. But the appellants rely upon business
done under two similar contracts made in New York to
show that there was intrastate commerce in Mississippi
that may be taxed without burdening the main activity
that the State cannot touch. Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v.
Mon.ier, 266 U. S. 555, 563. East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax
Commission, 283 U. S. 465, 470. Distributing companies
tap the plaintiff's pipes near Natchez and the town of
Woodville. The gas withdrawn by the distributors is
measured by a thermometer and a meter furnished by the
plaintiff which is the only way in which it can be measured. The pressure of the gas is reduced by: the plaintiff

before it passes iinto th purchaser's hands. The w6rk
done by the plaintiff is done upon fieflowing gasto help
: e elivery and seems to us'plaily to be 'incident to the
'inteitate commerce between Louisiana anci Mississippi.
