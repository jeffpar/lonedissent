OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

284U.S.

held that a corporation does not realize taxable income
by settling a debt for a lesser sum in dollars than it was
obligated to pay.
The Board of Tax Appeals in many cases, beginning
with- Independent Brewing Co, 4 B. T. A. 870, has held
that no income is.realized in the circumstances -here
involved.
Cancellation of indebtedness is a capital transaction
which does not result in income. United States v.
Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 251 Fed. 211;. Meyer
Jewelry Co., 3 B. T. A. 1319; John F. Campbell Co., 15
B. T. A. .458; 50 F. (2d) 487;. Eastside Mfg. Co., 18
B. T. A. 461; Progress Paper Co., 20 B. T. A. 234; Herman Senner; 22 B. T. A. 655.
Income does not mean transactions not cobnected with
the corporate activities and which only affect the capital
structure of the corporate taxpayer. Doyle v. Mitchell
Bros. Co., 247 U. S.179, 185.
1he transaction is a purchase by the taxpayer 6f. its
promise to pay. It is settled that income can be realized
only by the sale or other disposition of capital assets. If
income- could be realized by' purchase, every "good bargain" is taxable*when made. Purchase could not result
in income in this case, because bonds were purchased at
their then value, as shown by the judgment of the market
place.
MR. JusTICE

HoLm.s. delivered the opinion of the

'Court.
In July, 1923, the plaintiff, the Kirby Lumber Company, issued its own bonds for $12,126,800 for which it
received their par value. Later in the same year it purchased in the open market some of the same bonds at less
-than par, the.difference' of price being $137,521.30. The
question is whether this diffeience is a taxable gain or
income of the plaintiff for the 7ear 1923. By the Rev-

Opinion of the.-Court.
enue Act of (November 23,).. 1921, c. 136, § 213 -(a)
gross income includes "gains or- profits and- income derived from 'any source- whatever," and .by the Treasury.
Regulations auhorized by. § 1303, that have been in force
through repeated reenactments, If the corporation purchases and retires any of such bonds at-a-pric-Iess-than
the excess of the issuing
the issuing price or face value,.
"price
-or face value over • the purchase price .is gain or
income for the taxable year." Article 545 i(1) (c) of
Regulations 62, under Revenue Act of 192Lt S-ee Article 544 (1) (c) of Regulations 45, under Re, enue•Act
of 1918; Article 545 (1) (c) of'Regulations 65, U derRevenue Act of 1924; Article 545 (1).' (c) of Regulations
69, under Revenue Act of 1926; Article 68 (i) -(c) of
Regulations 74, under Revenue Act of 1928. We see no
-reason why the. Regulations should not be accepted'as a
correct statement of the.law.

in Boiver v. Ketbaugh-.mpire"qo., 271-. S. 170, the
defendant in drror. owned the stock of another company.
that had borrowed' money repayable -in marks or their
equivalent-for au enterprise that *failed. At the time of
payment the marks had fallen'in'value, which so far'as
it went was a gain for the defendant in error, and it was.
contended by the plaintiff in error-that the gain was taxable income, But the transaction as a whole was a loss,
and the contention -was denied. Here' there -was no
shrinkage of assets and the fxpayer made a -clear -gain.
As a result of its dealings it made available $137,521.30
assets previously offset by the obligation 'of bonds now
eiktinct. We see nothing to be gaumed 'by.the-discussion
of judicial definitions. The defendant in error has real-.
ized within the year an ac'cession to income, 'if we take
words in their plain popular meaning, as they should be
taken here. Bi rnet v. Sanford & Brooks C6., 282 U, S.
$59, 64.

JAdgrnnt reversed.
