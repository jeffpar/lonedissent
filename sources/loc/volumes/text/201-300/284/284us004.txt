Opinion of the Court.

of the mortgage and those who became suclf-between the
date of the mortgage and that on which it was recorded;
there having been a failure to observe the requirements
of the Civil Code of California, § 3440. The question
raised is whether the mortgage is void also as against
those who gave the bankrupt credit at'a later date, after
the mortgage was on record. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed an order of the DistrictJudge giving the
mortgage priority over the last creditors. Whether the
Court was right must be decided by the Bankruptcy Act •
since it is -superior to all state laws upon the subject.
Globe Bank v. Martin,236 U. S. 288, 298.
The trusfee in bankruptcy getsthe title to all property
which has been transferred by the bankrupt in fraud of
creditors, or which prior to the petition he couldby any
means have transfefred, or-wh'ch might have .been levied
upon and sold under judicial process against him. Act of
July 1, 1898, c. 541, § 70; U. S. -Code, Title 11, § -110.
By § 67, Code, Title 11, § 107 (a), claimswhich for want:
of record or for other reasons would not have been valid.
liens as against the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt
shall not- be liens against- his estate. - The rights of the
trustee"by subrogation are to be enforced for -the benefitof the estate. The Circuit Courts of Appeals" seemgenerally to agree,-as the language of the Bafikruittcy Ac.t
appears to us to imply very plainly, that what thus is
recovered for the benefit of the estate is to. be distributed
in "dividends of an. equal percentum on all allowed
claims, except such as have priority or are secured."
