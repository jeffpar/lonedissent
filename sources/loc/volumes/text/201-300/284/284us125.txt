Argument for Appellants.

284 U.S.

Mr. Wylie M. Barrow, with whom Messrs. Percy Saint,
Attorney General. of Louisiana, Lewis L. Mbrgan, and
Michel Provosty were on the brief, for the Louisiana
Public Service Commission et al., appellants.
There was no investigation 6r finding by, or evidence
-before, the Ccmmission as to the cost of performing the
service in the territory involved in this proceeding; and
the full hearing contemplated by § -13 (4) has not been
.had.
Discrimination against interstate commerce growing
out of a rate disparity should not be held as undue, unreasonable, or unjust unless it be shown that the intrastate -rates are so low as to place an undue burden upon
interstate commerce, and this requires an investigation
into the, remunerativeness of -the intrastate rates, especially in view of the controlling language of § 15a (2).
Floridav. United States,-31 F. (2d) 580, 581; 282 U. S.
194; 1 Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated, p. 379.
There is no finding or reference to evidence by the
Commission as to the cost of performing the ferry transfer service, although separate ferry arbitrary charges are
established by the Commission to apply on intrastate
traffic.
The ferry services for which additional charges are prescribed are parts of the transportation services of the railroads, operating these ferries or using them as parts of
their through lines.
The. Commission has treated the ferry charges as
divisions of through rates, by prescribing separate charges
for ferry services performed, in an arbitrary and illegal
manner, and w ilout investigation or consideration of
§ 15 (6).
There is no authority vested in the Commission to fix
'
" arbitrary" rate or charge of any sort. ' The word
"arbitrary" is not used in the Interstate Commerce Act,
P8 amended.

Argument f6r Appellants.

The ferries across the Mississippi operated by the rail.rQads form a part of their continuous through lines, aid
are included in the term "railroad," as used in the- Act.
There is no authority in the Commission to accord ,themn
special tteatment,. especially in the absence of any evidence of their value, the cost of performing the service,
*or of other essential elements of rate-making.
'Allowances" are only authorized finder § 15 (13), for
services or instrumentalities of commerce, furnished' by
the- owner of the property to be transported. The. ferry
-charges are not allowances. They form a parf -of the
through rate. The procedure td be followed, in making
through rates is laid down in § 15-(5), (6), which require
a full hearing, and :provide that ii determining the
divisions of joint rates, the Commission shall give due
consideration-to certain specified things. Brimitone B,

R. Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 74.
There was no finding or reference to evidence by the.
Commission showing a real and substantial burden upon
interstate commerce growing out of the disparity between
the Louisiafia intrastate iates and interstate rates on the,
said commodities in the territory herein involved. The
undue preference of intrastate shippeis and undue prejudice against interstate shippers,; as well as the unjilst
discrimination against interstate commerce which -the
proceeding was intended to correct were confined bythe
Commission's findings to northern Louisiana.

the carriers involved, as well as the cost of performing
the service. Obviously, without such a showing there is
no proof upon which it can be determined that the intrastate rates cast an undue burden upon interstate commerce. Wisconsin Case, 257 U. S. 563; New York Case,
257 U. S. 591.
The harsh exercise of power by the federal commission
was beyond the necessities of the case, and violative of
the principle announced in Lawrence v. St. Louis-S. F.
Ry. Co.,-274 U. S.588, 594, 595.
It is stretching the law too far to say that the Commission can step in and fix intrastate rates in one State to
conform with those in another State. The disparity in
rates which the Commission is authorized to end by
directly removing it is, " a disparity of intrastate rates as
compared with interstate rates." FloridaLog Cases, 282
U. S: 194.; New York v. United States, 257 U. S.591.
This arbitrary ferry charge applies on all traffic to and
from the ports of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, both
ports of entry. No such charges are made on traffic to
and from any Texas ports, although there are bridges,
ferries, and a causeway to be crossed by the iailroads servling Texas ports. The charges therefore give a direct preference to the Texas ports over the Louisiana ports, and
consequently violate the Constitution. PennSylvania v..

The fact that the investigation by the Commission was
a Hoch-Smith investigation did not add any power to that
which it derived from the provisions of § 13 (4) and
§ 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended. The
requirements of § 13 (4) and of § 15a both must be met
before state rates can be disturbed by the federal
ommnission,

Opinion of the Court.

There must be basic findings by the Commission under
both § 13 (4) and § I5a;, based upon substantial evidence, before it may destroy the exercise of state authority
and set aside intrastate rates. Florida v. United States,

MR. JUSTIcF BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Interstate Commerce Commission, June 3, 1929
(155 I. C. C. 247) and September 30, 1929 (157 I. C. C.
498) prescribed rates for the transportation of sand, gravel
and other named commodities, hereafter referred to as
road materials, in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and that
part of Louisiana west of the Mississippi, including certain points on the east bank of the river. The rates werebased on straight mileage. Eight cents per ton was added
for ferrying such of the traffic as crosses the Mississippi to
and from the named points on. the east bank. The rates
were made to apply alike to interstate -and intrastate
transportation.
• The commissions of Arkansas, Oklahoma and -Texas,,
respectively, adopted for application therein the intrA.
state rates so prescribed. The carriers applied to the
Louisiana Public Service Comnission for authority to-give:
them effect in that State. October 12, 1929, tle commission adopted .them as to traffic between point. on and.

-The first of these suits was brought by the cairiers
against the commission and its members to enjoin them
from interfering with the .application of these intrastate
rates. -The other was brought by the State and the commission to annul them. 28 U. S. C., § 47. A court of three
judges heard the cases, held the rates valid, granted a
permanent injunction in the first suit, No. 36, and disi isse d the other, No. 37. 41 F. (2d) 293. The cases are
here on direct appeal. § 345 (4).
Appellants seek reversal on the grounds that the inclusion of the allowance for ferrying the Mississippi gives
preference to Galveston, Houston and. other ports ofTexas over New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana
in violation of the Constitution, Art. I, § 9,. c. 6; that the
Interstate Commerce Commission .made no. findings and
had no evidence as to the cost of the ferry service; and that
there is no evidence to warranta finding that the lower
intrastate rates in dffect under 'state authority operate as

The power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is exclusive and has no limitations other
than such as afise from the Constitution itself. Gibbons

The clauge of the Constitution invoked. is: "No -Preference shall be given by afly Regulation of Commerce or
Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another;
Nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged
to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another." The specified
limitations on the power of Congress were set to prevent
preference as between States in respect of their ports or
the entry and clearance of vessels. It does not forbid
such discriminations as between .ports. Congress, acting
under the commerce clause, causes many things to be done
that greatly benefit particular ports and which incidentally result to the disadvantage of other ports in the same
or neighboring States. The establishing of ports oftntry,
erection and operation of lighthouses, improvement of
rivers and harbors and the'providing of structures for
the convenient and economical handling of traffic are examples. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge

.nd which always has been held to have been granted to
it by the commerce clause. It is clear thai the Constitution does not forbid the. allowance for ferrying the Mississippi at Louisiana ports.
Neither, the failure of the Commission separately to
ascertain and state, nor the absence of evidence to st9w,
the cost to carriers of the ferry service requires annulment
of the rates prescribed for transportation between the.
places on the east bank of the Mississippi and points west
of the river.
Those rates were made by adding eight cents per ton to
the mileage scale which was applied generally throughout
the above mentioned States. No rate specifically applies
to the carriage across the river. The orders do not relate
to divisions under § 15 (6) or to "allowances under § 15

require switching at places of loading and unloading and

conditions, the service is performed at costs per mile much
in excess of the average on other parts of the -haul.
•Straight .mileage schedules, appropriately may. be applied'
vhere c6nditions affecting transportation are reasoably

are to be regarded, it.
,practicable-if indeed it is at all possible-to ascertain in.

require any such determination.
There was evidence to show:
The commodities in question are used chiefly -for the
construction, improvement and maintenance of highways.

COMMISSION v. TEXAS & N. 0. R. CO..
125

133

Opinion of the Court.

Each of the, States mentioned has an extensive system of
highways and contemplates much construction, improvement and maintenance work. There are more than 300
sources of supply in the territory,, and by far the larger
part of the materials used in each State is-produced there-in. These commodities move in great volume. and constitute substantially more than ten per cent. of the
carriers' tonnage. In Louisiana there are many places
where such materials are produced. About 98% of the
improved highways in that State are constructed with
gravel. There is a large part of western Louisiana in
which no gravel is produced. Some road materials are
hauled intrastate more than 240 miles, large quantities
move from 100 to more-than 140miles and, as calculated
by the Commission, the -average is from 75 to 80 miles."
-In Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma there is a number of
places, not far- from Louisiana boundaries,'-where large
quantities of such materials available for use in that State
are produced. Notwithstanding the relatively low applicable Louisiana intrastate rates, substantial -quantities
are shipped from these outside sources for use on roads
in.various parts of the State including .the territory as to
which the state authorities refused to adopt the scale of
rates prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Louisiana highway commission constructs about 500
miles of road annually and the parishes construct considerable additional mileage. In each year great quantities
of road materials. are and in the future will be required
for road work in that State south of the Vicksburg, Shreve-.
port & Pacific Railroad and west of the Mississippi /At
shipping points throughout the whole territory prices.perton range about as follows: Washed gravel, fromii $0.60 t6
61.15; clay gravel, $0.40 to' $0.60; sand, $0.45 to $b.70;
crushed stone, $1.00 to-$1.50; shells,-$1.20 to $1.40;-.chat;
$0.25 to $0.35.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.Opinion of the Court.

284 U.S. -

The Commission found in Louisiana three scales of
intrastate rates applicable to these commodities. One applies to commercial shipments and is higher than that
prescribed by the orders under consideration. One somewhat- lower and on which comparatively little moves,
covers shipments to municipalities for the construction of
public buildings. The one here under consideration is
the lowest; it applies to materials used in the construction
of state and parish highways and city streets when the
shipments are consigned to and, the freight charges are
paid by federal, state, parish or municipal governments.
From 80% to 85% of all the traffic in such materials in,
western Louisiana moves on that scale. There is printed
in the margin a comparison of these rates with those ordered by the Commission.'

Opinion of the Court.

The latter are about 150% of the former. For 80*miles,
about the average intrastate haul, the prescribed rates
are higher by 30 cents per ton, for 100 miles 40 cents,
120 miles 50 cents; 140 miles 40 cents, and 200 miles 60
cents. Producers outside Louisiana are necessarily at
disadvantage in respect of the sale and delivery within
that State of such materials to the extent thht the. State
rates are lower than the prescribed scales I i the course
of the Commission's report it is said that the disparity between the two scales is bound to operate as a real discrimination against, and obstruction to, interstate com-merce, and result in interstate shippers being'unduly
prejudiced and interstate commerce unjustly burdened.
And in its,ultimate findings the Commisgion states that
the intrastate rates to the extent that they are lower,
distance considered,, than corresponding interstate rates
would result in undue preference and advantage to shippers and receivers of freight in-intrastate commerce within
western Louisiana and in uiidue prejudice to sbppers and
receivers of freight in interstate commerce between points
.in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas and points. in western
Louisiana, and in unjust discrimination: against interstate.
commerce.
The facts above stated are adequately supported by the
evidehce and are clearly sufficient to waiiant the Interstate Commerce Commission in prescribing, under § 13(3)
(4), the schedule of intrastate rates under consideration.
