Decided December 7,

1. The bankruptcy courts have power to sell real estate of bankrupts
free from liens of state taxes, transferring the liens-from the property to the proceeds of sale. P. 227.
2. Ohjections that the notice given the state treasurer in this case
was insufficient and that the proceeding to determine* priority of
liens should have been plenary rather than summary,--held not
open'in this Court, not having been made in, or discussed by, the
courts below. P. 229.
3. A decision of a state sulireme court dismissing a petition in error
as of right to review a judgment of in - intermediate court, upon
the ground that the constitutional question raised, and upon which
the jurisdiction of the higher court depended, was not debatable, is
a decision of the merits, so that a writ of certiorari from this Court
should go to the supreme court if it has the record, and not to the
intermediate court. P. 230.
4. In reviewing the judgment of a state supreme-court; .a transcript
of the record in that court, certified by its clerk and filed here with
the petition for eertiorari is, by Rule 43, to be treated as sent up in
response to a formal writ, and in such case there is no occasion to
direct a writ to the intermediate state court to which, under the
rules of the state supreme court, the'recbrd may have been re-.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Van Huffel brought this suit in the Court of Common
Pleas of Trumbull County, Ohio, to quiet his "titleto two
parcels of real estate acquired from the purchaser at a sale
made by the bankruptcy court for that district. The defendaht, the county treasurer, asserts a lien for unpaid
state taxes. which had accrued prior to the bankruptcy.
The sale was made pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy
court which directed that 'all liens be marshalled; that the
property be sold free of all encumbrances; and that the
rights of all lien holders be transferred to 'the proceeds of
the sale. The trial court entered a decree quieting the
title. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals
of the county. The Supreme Court of the-State declined
to review .the case. 177 N. E. 587. This Court granted
certiorari. .283 U. S. 817.
Section 5671 of the Ohio General Code provides: "The
lien of the state for taxes levied for all purpses, in each
year, shall attach to all real property subject to such taxes

Opinion of the Court.

on the day preceding -the second Monday of April, annually, and continue until such taxes, with any ipenaltieis
accruing thereon, arepaid." The bankruptcy court, having held two mortgages executed by the bankrupt to be
prior.in lien to the taxes, applied all of the proceeds of the
sale toward the satisfaction of one -of'them; and left the
staie'taxes -unpaid. The. treasurer did. not by any proceedingin that court question the propriety of such action.
Van Huffel admits that the decision of thb bankruptcy'
court-was erroneous in denying priority to the taxes, .but
insists that it is res judicata. The treasurer contends that
the judgmefit of the bankruptcy court authorizing and
confirming the sale free from the tax lien is a iiullity, because the court was without power to sell property of the
bankrujt free from the existing eieh-for taxes; and lso
because it did not acqui.re jurisdiction- over.the State in
that proceeding.
First; The present Bahkruptcy Act (July 1, 1898, . 30
Stat. 544, c. 541), unlike the Act .of 1867,' contains no provision which in terms confers upon bankruptcy courts the
,power to sell property of the bankrupt free from encumbrances. We tink it" clear that the power was granted
by implication. Like power had long been exercised :by^
federal courts sitting-in equity when' ordering sales by
receivers or on foreclosure. First National Bank v.
SShedd, 121 U.'S. 74, 87-; 'Mellenv: Moline Malleable Iron
Works, 131 U. S. 352, 367. The lower federal courts have
consistently held that the bankruptcy court possesses'the
'-Act of March 2, 1867,.14 Stat. 517, c. 176, §§ 1, 20; .Ray v. Norseworthy, 23 Wall. 128, 134: _See as to Act of August 19, 1841, 6 Star,

power, stating that it must be implied from the general
,equity powers of the court and the duty imposed by § 2
of the Bankruptcy Act to collect, reduce to money and
distribute the estates of bankrupts, and to determine ccntroversies with relation thereto.3
No good reasop is suggested why liens for state taxes
should be deemed to have been excluded from the scope
.of ,this general power to sell free from encumbrances.
Section 64 of, the Bankruptcy Act grants to the court
express authority to determine ' the amount or legality"
of any tax. To transfer the lien from the property to the
,proceeds of its.sale is*the exercise of. a lesser power; and
legislation conferring it is obviously constitutional._ Realization upon thelien created by the state law must yield
to the requirements of bankruptcy administration' Compare International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, 278 U. S. 261;
Isaacs v. Hbbs Tie & Timber Co., 282 U. S. 734; Straton
v. New, 283 U. S. 318. In many of the cases in the lower
federal courts the order of sale entered was broad enough
to authorize a sale free from tax liens as well as from
others; 4 and in some of them it appears affirmatively that
liens for taxes were treated as discharged by, the order.5

Opinion of the Court.

No case has been found, in which the power to sell free
from the lien of state taxes was denied.
Second. The treasurer contends that the order authorizing a sale free from encumbrances was void as against
the State for lack of notice and opportunity to be heard.
He asserts that he'had no knowledge of the ruling of the
court determining the priority of the liens; that neither
'henor his counsel, the prosecuting attorney; was present
at any of .the proceedings; aiid thit the notice of the
public sale, mailed to him after the order of sale had been
made by the referee, did not state that the .property was
to be sold " free and clear of encumbrances." But-it appears that prior to any action by the court, notice of the
filfng of the application to sell free and clear of encumbrances. was mailed -to the treasurer; and that thereafter
he mailed to the referee a statement of the taxes due. It
is urged that such notice was insufficient; and also that-a
proceeding to determine the priority of liehs is plenary,
whereas the order now complained of was entered in a
summary proceeding. Compare Ray v. Norseworthy, 23
Wall. 128. We have no occasion to pursue the argument.
So far as appears, neither of these- objectionswas made
by the treasurer below, nor were they discussed by any of
the state courts. They cannot, therefore, be urged here.

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.-

284 U.S.:

Third. There remains for consideration a question of
practice. 'After the adverse judgment in the Court of
Appeals, Van Huffel filed in the Supreme C6urtof Ohio
a petition in error as of right,, claiming that a constitutional question was involved; and he filed there also a,
motion requesting that the Court of Appeals be directed
to certify its Tecord for review. The, Supreme Court dis" missed the petition in error on the ground that no debatable constitutional question was involved; and it'overruled the motion to certify the record for review. An
application for rehearifig was denied, as to both. Van
Huffel filed two petitions for certiorari, one .(No. 54)
directed .to the Court. of Appeals, the other (No, 55)
directed to the. Supreme Court. He states that he did.
this because he was uncertain to which of the state courts
the certiorari from this Court should b7e directed. The question which we have discussed is a federal constitutional question. The Constitution of Ohio; Article
-IV, § 2," confers upon the Supreme Court of the State'
C"appellate jurisdiction, in all cases involving questions
arising under the constitution of the United States or of
this state." The- order of the Supreme Court dismissing
the petition in error -as of right, on the ground that no,
'debatable constitutional question was involved, was noi,
in law, a dismissal of the petition for want of jurisdiction. It was a decision of the case on the merits. Hetrick
v. Vi lage of Lindsey, 265 U.. S. 384, 386" Matthews v.
Huwe, 269 U. S.262, 265. Under the federal practice a
writ of certiorari would, therefore, have to be directed to
that court if it had possession of the record to be reviewed. Atherton v. Fowler, 91 U. S. 143, 146. The
petition in error as of right was necessarily. accompanied
by a transcript of the final record in the Court of Appeals.
Ohio, General Code, 1§ 12,263. It is suggested in the brief
for the treasurer, however, that such record went out of
the possession of the Supreme Court after it dismissed

the petition in error and denied the motion for certiorari;
and in support of this allegation we are referred to Rule
IX of the Supreme Court, 122 0. S.lxxii, which provides
for the return of the record to the lower court "after
the decision of a cause . . .in which a final record is not
required to be made' in" the Supreme Court., But we
have 6btained the record from the court whose decision
we are to review, and so have no occasion to resort to any
other court in order to get it. Atherton v. Fowler, supra.
Our Rule 43 provides that the certified transcript of the
record on file here shall be treated. as though sent up.in
*response to a formal writ. The case at bar should, therefore, properly be considered on -the writ (in No. 55) issued to the Supreme Court of Ohio; and the writ (in No.
54) issued to the Court of Appeals shoula be discharged.
In No. 55, Judgment reversed.
In No. 54, Writ of. .Certiorari discharged.
