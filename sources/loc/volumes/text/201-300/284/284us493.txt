MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Lee Ray Jackson, a soldier in the United States army,
received a certificate of insurance on his life, issued by the
United States through the Bureau of War Risk Insurance
on September 5, 1918. His wife, Mary Lucinda Jackson,
was named as beneficiary. He died intestate March 21,
1921, a resident of Craig County, Oklahoma, leaving him
surviving his wife and a son named James Lee Roy Jack"* See table of cases reported in this volume.

son, a minor child about seven months old. In March,
1922, the child died, of course intestate; and in March,
1923, the widow died intestate, in the meantime having
married Charley Singleton, one of the petitioners. No
part of the insurance due under the certificate was paid
during the lifetime of the insured or beneficiary; but the
sum accrued between. March 31, 1921, and March 30,
1923, has since been paid to the administrator of the estate of Mary Lucinda Jackson, who, at the time of her
death, was Mary Lucinda Singleton. The amount of insurance due to the insured on account of permanent disability has been paid to the administrator de bonis non
of the estate of Lee Ray Jackson. The remaining installments of the life insurance were commuted and the sum
thereof, fixed by the War Rtisk Bureau, was also paid to
the administrator last named. Such payments of the
disability insurance and the sum of the commuted installments were authorized by the Veterans' Bureau and, the
administrator directed to distribute the amounts in accordance with the intestacy laws of the state of the insured's last legal residence, an award in favor of the
administrator in each case having previously, been made.
The respondents, Edith Cheek, n6e Jackson, and Jewel
Braziel, n6e Jackson, are sisters, and Emmett Jackson is
a brother, of Lee Ray Jackson. Neither his father nor his
mother survived him. George Davis and Maggie Davis
are the parents of Mary Lucinda Singleton, but neither
they nor Charley Singleton are blood kin to the insured.
During her 'lifetime Mary Lucinda Jackson administered the estate of Lee Ray Jackson, and upon her final
report the court having probate jurisdiction found that
she was entitled to all of the estate of the deceased Lee
Ray Jackson, one-half in her own right, and the other
one-half in the right of the minor child above named.
A decree of heirship to that effect was duly entered.

SINGLETON v. CHEEK.
493

Opinion of the Court.

In the administration following the death of Mary Lucinda Singleton and the infant son of Lee Ray Jackson,
the same court determined that petitioners were entitled
to the disability insurance which accrued before the death
of the insured, but that respondents were entitled to the
commuted value of the insurance falling due after the
death of the beneficiary, holding that the commuted balance of such insurance was payable to the estate of the
insured, but vested in the heirs next surviving within
the permitted class of beneficiaries designated by the Wai
Risk Insurance Act of 1917, c. 105, Art. 4, § 402, 40 Stat.
398, 409, as amended by the World War Veterans' Acts of
-1919, c. 16, § 13, 41 Stat. 371, 375, and of 1924, c. 320,
§§ 300, 303, 43 Stat. 607, 624, 625. The case was ap-"
pealed to a state district court, where a different judgment was rendered. From that judgment an appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, where it was
twice heard. That court first sustained the petitioners'
contention. Subsequently, upon rehearing, it held in
favor of the respondents in respect of the commuted installments accruing after the death of the beneficiary, and
in favor of petitioners as to those accruing before her
death, following a decision of the Supreme Court of Kentucky in ,Sutton's Executor v. Barrs Administrator, 219
Ky. 543; 293 S. W. 1075, in which that court had decided
that the heirs of the insured in being at the time of the
death of the beneficiary took the property, and not those
who were heirs at the time of the death of the insured.'

4OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

284 U. S.

court in the original administration of the Jackson estate
fixed the parties entitled to inherit all his estate; "whether
the assets were then in the hands of the administrator, or
later came into the possession of an administrator de bonis
non "; and that when the widow died these assets became
assets of her estate, to be distributed among her heirs.
By the second Oklahoma decision this was reversed, upon
the authority of the very case which had been distinctly
rejected in the first decision.
We are of opinion that the first decision was right, and
the second wrong. Undoubtedly,'by § 15 of the War-Risk
Insurance Amending Act of 1919, - 'wrar risk insurance,
after the death of the designated beneficiary, became payable to such -person or persons within the permitted
class of beneficiaries (enumerated in § 402, Act of 1917, as
amended by § 13, Act of 1919) as would, under the laws
of the state of the residence of the insured, be entitled to
his personal property in case of .intestacy. The'second
decision of the state supreme court, therefore, would have
been entirely correct if no change had been made in the
statute. But a radical change had been effected prior to
the award of insurance made by the Veterans' Bureau on
August 18, 1925. The Act of March 4, 1925, c. 553, 43
Stat. 1302, 1310, amended § 303 of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924 (which had in turn amended and modifled the preceding acts), to read as follows:
See. 15. That if any person to whom such yearly renewable term
insurance has been awarded dies, or his rights are otherwise terminated after the death of the insured, but before all of the two hundred
and forty monthly installments have been paid, then the monthly
installments- payable and applicable shall be payable to such person
or persons within the permitted class of beneficiaries as would, under
the laws of the State of residence of the insured, be entitled to his
personal property in case of intestacy; and if the permitted class of
beneficiaries be exhausted before all of the two hundred and forty
monthly installments have been paid, then there shall be paid to the
estate of the last surviving person within the permitted class the
remaining unpaid monthly installments."
2-

SINGLETON v. CHEEK,
493

Opinion of the Court.

"If no person within the permitted class be designated
as beneficiary for yearly renewable term insurance by the
insured either in his lifetime or by his last will and testament or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the
insured or survives the insured and dies prior to receiving
all of the two hundred and forty installments or all such
as are payable and applicable, there shall be paid to the
estate of the insured the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable, said value to be computed
as of date of last payment made under any existing
award."

The amendment, in express terms, was made retroactive
so as tO take effect as of October 6, 1917, a provision undoubtedly within the power of Congress, for the reasons
stated by this court in White v. United States, 270 UI. S.
175.
By that amendment, the rule, which, upon the happening of the contingencies named in the prior acts, limited
the benefit of the unpaid installments to persons within
the designated class of permittees, was abandoned, and
" the estate of the insured" was wholly substituted as the
payee. All installments, whether accruing before the
death of the insured or after tho death of the beneficiary
named in the certificate of insurance, as a result, became
assets of the estate of the insured as of the instant of
his death, to be distributed to the heirs of the insured
in accordance with the intestacy laws of the state of his
residence, such limirs to be determined as of the date of
his death, and not as of the date of the death of the beneficiary. The state courts, with almost entire unanimity,
hav'e reached the same conclusion.
Judgment reversed.
