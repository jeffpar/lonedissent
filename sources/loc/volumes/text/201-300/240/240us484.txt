BARLOW v. NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH
DAKOTA.
No. 257.

Argued March 3, 1916.-Decided April 3, 1916.

Under the Right of Way Act of March 3, 1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482,
the rights of a railroad company entitled to the benefit of the act
are paramount over those of a homestead entryman holding a
patent of the United States in consequence of rights initiated after
the line was in course of construction, but before the map of the
right of way had been filed in local land office. Jamestown & Northern R. R, v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125, followed and Minn., St. Paul &c.
Ry. v. Doughty, 208 U. S.251, distinguished.
26 N. Dak. 159, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the rights of a railroad company under the Right of Way Act of 1875 and of an entryman under the Homestead Act, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. S. E. Ellsworth, with whom Mr. John Knauf was on
the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Charles Donnelly, with whom Mr. Charles W. Bunn
and Mr. Emerson Hadley were on the brief, for defendant
in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of

the court.
In Tamestown & Northern R. R. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125,
there came under consideration the construction of the
act of Congress of March 3, 1875, entitled "An act granting to railroads the right of way through.the public lands

. of the United States," c. 152, i8 Stat. 482. The case
involved a controversy between the railroad which was
entitled to the benefit of the act and Jones, a homestead
entryman holding a patent of the United States in consequence of rights initiated after the railroad had constructed its line but before it had filed a map of its right
of way in the appropriate local land office. The railroad
claimed that its right of way across the land covered by
Jones' patent was paramount and Jones asserted that his
right under the patent was dominant. Giving sanction
to a previous course of administrative construction dealing with unsurveyed public land, it was held that an
appropriation of the right of way by a construction of
the road under the statute gave the railroad the paramount
right and that the provision of the statute concerning the
filing of a map and profile in the local land office was intended not to deprive 6f the power to fix and secure the
right of way by construction in advance of filing such
map and profile, but simply to afford the means of securing-'the right of way in advance of construction. The
two methods of securing the right, the one by construction of the road, and the other in anticipation of construction by filing a map, were decided to in no wise conflict
the one with the other as both afforded a means of securing the right which the statute gave. The opinion
pointed out that although the previous administrative
rulings were concerned only with unsurveyed land8, they
were equally applicable under the statute to surveyed
lands, and it was thus concluded, p. 132:" It follows from
-these views that the grant to plaintiff in error (the railroad company) by the act of 1875 became definitely fixed
by the actual construction of its road, and that the entry
of the defendant in error (Jones) was subject thereto."
In Minneapolis, St. Paul, &c. Ry. v. Doughty, 208
U. S. 251, the controversy was between the Railway
Company and a settler holding a patent of the United

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.!
Opinion of the Court.

States whose right had been initiated before the construction of the railroad but after a preliminary survey which
had been made by the railroad as a means of ultimately
determining upon what line it would build its road, the
stakes of such survey being, at the time the settler initiated his right, across the land in question. The claim of
the settler was that a mere entry of the railroad for the
purpose stated was not a construction within the meaning of the Jones Case, while that of the railroad was "that
an entry upon the land to locate the road is as necessary
as an entry on the land to build the road, and, being
there, the railroad could not become a trespasser; either as
to the government or as to the plaintiff." It was decided
that as a mere preliminary step for the purpose of determining where the road should be located was not in and
of itself the equivalent of a definite location of the line
and a permanent appropriation of the right of way, the
case was not covered by the rule of the Jones Case and the
right of the settler was paramount.
Which of these rulings is here controlling is the single
question arising for decision on this record, as will be at
once seen by the following statement of the case:
The suit was commenced by the railroad to quiet its
title to its right - of way across a quarter-sdction of land
which had been patented by the United States to the
defendant. The latter not only by answer, but by counterclaim asserted the paramount nature of his right. The
court below, affirming the action of the trial court, held
that the rights of the railroad were paramount upon the
conclusion that the facts found clearly brought the case
within the rule established in the Jones Case. (26 N.
Dak. 159.) The fdicts as thus established were these,
p. 161:
"On the said 22d day of July'A. D. 1883, intending to
make entry of the said land therein described when the
same was surveyed, and to acquire title to the same by

Opinion of the Court.

virtue of the compliance with the pre~mptionh laws. of the
United States, said Frederick G. Barlow [the predecessor
in title of the plaintiff in error] settled upon saidland
and took up his residence thereon. At the time of such
settlement there was not a railroad track or line of railroad in operation across said land at any place, nor had
,plat or profile of the section of railroad extending across
such land hereinbefore referred to been filed in the United
States District Land Office at Fargo.. We find from the
evidence that, although Barlow entered upon the land
upon the 22d day of July, .A. D. 1883, the grading'of the
road across said land was, completed prior to May 31st,
1883; that-is to say, nearly two months before his settlement. We also find the rails were laid upon the grade
between August 10th and 15th, 1883, and that trains
were operated on said road and across said land soon
after."
That under these facts the court below was right in hold-ing that the controversy was foreclosed by the ruling inthe
Jones C'ase we think is too clear for anything but statement. The contention that the case is controlled by the
Doughty and not the Jbnes Case because the road was not
complete and operating when the entrymai initiated his
rights although it Was then graded' and was virtually
ready for the ties and rails, if acceded to, would render the
statute inefficacious and dominate the substance of things
by the mere shadow. The first, because as it is impossible
to conceive of the completion of the road by the placing
of ties and the laying of rails without presupposing the
pribr doing of the work of grading, it would follow that
the recognition of the right of an entryman to appropriate
adversely to the railroad after the grading had been done
and before the laying of the ties and rails would render the
performance of the latter useless and would deprive the
railroad therefore of all practical power to appropriate.
The second, because as pointed out in Stalker v. Oregon

Short Line, 225 U. S. 142, the decision in the Jones Case
rested not upon the ground that the work of construction
had reached the absolutely completed stage so as to enable
the road to be operated, but on the fact that the work was
of such a character as to manifest that the railroad company had exercised its judgment as to where its line was
to be established and had done such work of construction
as "necessarily fixes the position of the route and consummates the purpose for which the grant of a right of way
is given" (p. 150). And it is obvioug that this standard
when complied with would serve not only to demonstrate
the fixed intention of the railroad to appropriate, but also
to give tangible and indubitable evidence to others of the
right of way appropriated, thus preventing injury to innocent persons which might result from their selection of
land in ignorance of the fact of its prior appropriation.
The distinction between the doctrine of the Jones Case and
that of the Doughty Case is therefore that which necessarily
must obtain between permanent work of construction of a
railroad on a line definitely selected and fixed by it, and
mere tentative work of surveying done by a railroad for
the purpose of enabling the line which it was proposed to
construct to be ultimately selected. The broad distinction
between this case and the Doughty Case both as to the
fundamental rights given by the statute and the protection to innocent parties was thus lucidly pointed out by
the court below in its opinion:
"There can be no doubt, indeed, that the route was
fixed, both on account of the physical construction and
the difficulty of a subsequent removal,
.....
The
entryman in this case can have no more ground for complaint than could the entryman in the case of Stalker v.
OregonShort Line, supra. It would be absurd to hold that
one who enters upon land and sees upon it a railroad
grade which is only 18 days from physical completion,
and, as we have a right to believe, but. a link in miles of

road stretcning across the same prairie, was not aware of
this prior railroad occupation."
We have not stopped to consider an intimation contained in the argument that the court erred in its finding
of fact as to the state of construction of the road at the
time the entry by Barlow was made, because without at all
questioning our power to review the ,facts in so far as necessary to dispose of the Federal contention, we consider
the suggestion wholly without merit, first, because we
would not in any event disregard the finding of fact of
the court below except upon conviction of clear error
committed, for which the record here affords no ground
whatever; and second, because as the finding of the court
below was also the finding of the trial court, the request
invites us to disregard the findings of both courts on a
matter of fact in the absence of any ground for a conviction that error of fact was clearly committed.
Affirmed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA.
No. 269.

Argued March 10, 1916.-Decided April 3, 1916.

The Federal Employers' Liability Act, in so far as it deals with the
subjects to which it relates, is paramount and exclusive, and recovery
under it can be had only in the mode prescribed, and by and for the
persons in whose favor it creates and bestows a right of action.
T'htk Federal Employers' Liability Act contains no definition of- who
are to constitute the next of kin to whom it grants a right of recovery,

and the absence of such definition indicates the purpose of Congress
to leave the determination of that question to the state law.
