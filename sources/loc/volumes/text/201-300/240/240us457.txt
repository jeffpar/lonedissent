and willing to assume the responsibility of direction and
to be judged by its results. This is manifest from the
contract under review and from the cooperage contract;
it is also manifest from his contracts with the other companies to whose industries the railroad company's tracks
extended. We certainly cannot say that he was incompetent to assume such relation and incur its consequences.
Thus being of opinion that Turner was not an employee
of the company but an independent contractor, it is not
material to consider whether the services in which he was
engaged were in interstate commerce.
Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

SOUTHERN WISCONSIN RAILWAY COMPANY v.
CITY OF MADISON..
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
No. 260. Argued March 6, 7, 1916.-Decided March 20, 1916.
Although the charter of a railway company was held in this case to be a
contract, a later ordinance requiring it to pave with asphalt the
space between its tracksand one foot on each side was held not to be
an impairment of its obligation or a violation of the due process or
equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The state court having found that the pavement between the tracks of
a street railway needed repair, and that the pavement originally
used was not suitable and was additionally unsuitable when the rest
of the street was paved with asphalt, this court will not declare the
State wrong in holding that a provision requiring the railway company to keep the space between the tracks and one foot on each side
in proper repair so as not to interfere with travel over the same was
*broad enough io cover requiring it to be paved with asphalt when the
rest of the street was so paved.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit brought by the City of Madison to recover the cost of asphalt pavement between the rails of
the defendant's track and one foot on the outside of them,
for a certain distance along University Avenue in that
City. The declaration, after stating the ordinances
under which the defendant and its predecessors had
built and operated the street railway concerned, sets out
an ordinance of June 11, 1910, requiring the defendant,
under a penalty, to do the work above described. The
defendant answered that to make it pay the cost would
deprive it of its property and-contract rights under its
franchise without due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Constitution of the
United States. The judge before whom the case was' tried
found that the designated space had become so out of
repair as to* interfere with travel and that the crushed
stone then used was not a proper pavement, and would
interfere with the asphalt laid down by the City, and
gave judgment for the plaintiff. The Supreme Court
accepted the defendant's position, that its charter was a
contract, but met the argument based upon it by a construction that warranted the later ordinance, and judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed. 156 Wisconsin, 352.
As our opinion is that the judgment should be affirmed,
we shall not dwell upon a motion to dismiss made by the
defendant in error. The court expressly upheld thelater
ordinance, and whether that ordinance can be upheld
without impairing the obligation of the admitted contract of the charter is a Federal question none the less
that the answer depends upon the construction of the instrument. Even if the opinion below be read as asserting
that the duty existed by the charter alone irrespective
of the later ordinance, still as the ordinance was set up
and relied upon in the declaration and was present im-

pelling, so far as might be, the decision reached and was
given effect by that decision, we should not dismiss the
case. Terre Haute &c. R. R. v. Indiana, 194 U. S. 579. We
lay on one siqe a suggestion that runs counter to the opinion below and to common sense, that the later ordinance,
when it requires the defendant to do the work under a
penalty of not exceeding fifty dollars a day, is not a legislative command but merely a notice to perform a duty
already in force..
Up to 1892 the defendant's franchise was held under a
charter that, after providing for the disposition to be
made of snow on the track, continued: "And said company shall keep the space between the rails and for the
distance of one. foot on the outside side of the rails in
proper repair so as not to interfere with travel over the
same,'and shall keep the same in proper order as to cleanliness at its own cost and expense." The charter thgn
went on to provide that whenever a street in which were
tracks should be paved or macadamized, the railway company should pave or macadamize the above-mentioned
space and keep it in equally good and corresponding condition. In 1892, a new ordinance was passed authorizing
the company to build and operate a road in the City and
to use electricity as a motive power upon its tracks then
or thereafter authorized and constructed. It had the
above-quoted provision as to keeping the space in repair,
and the grant was made 'subject to such reasonable rules
and regulations respecting such streets and highways and
operation of cars as the said council may from time to
time enact,' but the ordinance did not repeat the provision
as to paving. The Supreme Court held that. the requirement to keep the space in repair was enough, and, by a
diminished majority, that the ordinance of 191.0 fell
within the reasonable rules and regulations' that the
company was bound to obey.
If there had been no ordinance of 1910, but the suif

had been brought simply upon the alleged duty under the
charter of 1892, and the City had recovered as it might
have upon the present interpretation of that instrument,
there would have been no question for this court. Fisher
v. New Orleans, 218 U. S. 438, 440. While this consideration has not required us to dismiss the writ of error it
suggests reasons of more than usual force for following that
interpretation. Although we all agree that in this class
of cases it is our duty to see that parties are not deprived
of their constitutional rights under the guise of construction, still the mere fact that without the state decision
we might have hesitated is not enough to lead us to overrule that decision upon a fairly doubtful point. Tampa
WaterWorks Co. v. Tampa, 199 U. S. 241, 243, 244. We
appreciate the argument to be drawn from the- omission
of the paving clause in the charter of 1892, and the possible reason for its omission in the fact that the experiment of substituting electricity for horse power then was
relatively new. But it is also possible that the clause
was deemed superfluous, if, indeed, the omission should
be considered at all. Charles River Bridge v. Warren
Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 543, 544. It is to be remembered that
this requirement is a widespread- one with regard to street
railways. Reading v. United Traction Co., 202 Pa. St.
571, 573; 215 Pa. St. 250, 255. There are persuasive
decisions that the obligation to keep the space 'in proper
repair so as not to interfere with travel over the same'
extends to what was demanded of the defendant in this
case. Mayor of New York v. Harlem Bridge, Morrisania&
FordhamRy. Co., 186 N. Y. 304. State ex rel. Milwaukee v.
Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co., 151 Wisconsin, 520.
The reasons for construing such ordinances strictly in
favor of the public are reiterated in the present case.

decisions of this court. FairHaven & Westville R. R. Co. v.
New Haven, 203 U. S. 379, 389. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens'
Street Ry. Co., 184 U. S. 368, 397. In view of the finding
that the pavement needed repair and that crushed stone
would not have been suitable for the purpose and would
have been additionally unsuitable when the rest of the
street was paved with asphalt we do not feel prepared
to declare the judgment wrong.
Judgment affirmed.

AKRON.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 465.

Argued October 20, 1915.-Decided March 20, 1916.

As the bill in this case states that a municipality does not intend to
institute proceedings to condemn, but does intend to take plaintiff's
property rights without compensation, and has taken steps that will
destroy such rights, and that in so doing it purports to be acting
under an ordinance which violates the contract clause of, and the
Fourteenth Amendment to, the Federal Constitution, held that such
municipal action is to be regarded as action of the State, and as the
only way to determine whether plaintiff has rights that the municipality is bound to respect, is to take jurisdiction and determine the
case on the merits, the District Court has jurisdiction.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court, are stated in the opinion.
