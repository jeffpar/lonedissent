Consistently with its prohibitions he could not proceed
with the work, except under a permissible regulation of the
Secretary of War. It is not contended that the work was
thus made permissible, and so the conclusion is unavoid-.
able that the claimant was proceeding in violation of the
statute and that the engineer officer and the district attorney rightly requested him to desist. Such inconvenience and damage as he sustained resulted not from a
taking of his property, but from the lawful exercise of a

Whether damages for anticipatory breach of an executory contract
which one of the parties can cancel on notice after a stated period can
be recovered for the life of the contract or only up to the end of such
period after the breach involves no Federal question.
Where the question on which a cross appeal is based is of general importance in relation to questions involved on the direct appeal, the
court may, and in this case does, allow a certiorari in lieu of the
cross appeal which must be dismissed.
The general rule, the exceptions to which are not material in this case,
is that where a party, bound by an executory contract, repudiates
his obligations or disables himself from performance, the promisee
has the option to treat the contract as ended and. may maintain
an action at once for damages occasioned by the anticipatory breach.
The intervention of bankruptcy, held, under the circumstances of this
case, to constitute such a breach, notwithstanding the petition was
involuntary; and also held that the claim of the promisee is one
founded upon a contract expressed or implied and provable under
§ 63a-4, and that the damages may be liquidated under § 63b.
In this case, held that the claim may be proved for damages occasioned
by the breach covering the entire life of the contract, notwithstanding the party proving the claim had the right to cancel on a stated
notice, that provision not being reciprocal.
216 Fed. Rep. 308, affirmed as to allowance of claim; cross appeal
therefrom dismissed; certiorari allowed and reversed as to amount
of claim allowed.
THE facts, which involve the effect of bankruptcy of
one party to an executory contract and the right of the
other party to regard the same as an anticipatory breach
of the contract and to prove its claim against the bankrupt's estate, are stated in the opinion.

performed. By its terms the Association granted to the
Transfer Company, for a term of five years from the date
of the contract, the baggage and livery privilege of the
Auditorium Hotel, in the City of Chicago, that is to say,
the sole and exclusive right, so far as it was within the
'legal capacity of the Association to grant the same, to
transfer baggage and carry passengers to and from the
hotel and to furnish livery to its guests and patrons. For
the baggage privilege the Transfer Company agreed to pay
to the Association the sum of $6,000, in monthly instalments of $100 each, and for the livery privilege the sum of
$15,000 in monthly instalments of $250 each, and also
agreed to furnish to the hotel and its guests and patrons
prompt and efficient baggage and livery service at reasonable rates at all times during the continuance of the
privileges. It was further agreed as follows:
"The party of the first part [Chicago Auditorium
Association], however, reserves the right, which is an
express condition of the foregoing grants, to cancel and
revoke either or both of said privileges, by giving six
months' notice in writing of its election so to do, whenever
the service is not, in the opinion of the party of the first
part, satisfactory, or in the event of any change in management of said hotel; and in case of the termination of either
or both of said privileges by exercise of the right and option
reserved by this paragraph, such privilege or privileges
shall cease and determine at the expiration of the six
months' notice aforesaid, and both parties hereto shall in
that case be released from further liability respecting the
concession so cancelled and revoked.
"Said rights and concessions shall not be assignable
without the express written consent of the party of the
first part, nor shall the assignment of the same, with such
written consent, relieve the party of the second part [Scott
Transfer Company] from liability on the covenants and
agreements of this instrument.'

CENTRAL TRUST CO. v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM.
240 U. S.

587

Opinion of the Court.

The contract authorized the Association, in the event of
default by the Transfer Company in the payment of any
instalment of money due, or in the performance of any
other covenant, if continued for thirty days, to terminate
the privileges at its option, without releasing the Transfer
Company from liability upon its covenants. Should either
or both of the privileges be thus terminated before January 31, 1916, the Association was to be at liberty to sell
the privileges, or make a new or different contract for the
remainder of the term, but was not to be obliged to do this,
and the Transfer Company, unless released in writing, was
to remain liable for the entire amount agreed to be paid
by it.
Up to the time of the bankruptcy this contract remained in force, and neither party had violated any of its
covenants. The trustee in bankruptcy did not elect to
assume its performance, and the Association entered into a
contract with other parties for the performance of the
baggage and livery service, and obtained therefrom the
sum of $234.69 mpnthly as compensation for those privileges. On February 28, 1912, it exhibited its proof against
the bankrupt estate, claiming an indebtedness of $6,537.94,
of which $311.20 had accrued prior to the bankruptcy
proceedings, and the remainder was claimed as unliquidated damages arising under the contract for alleged
breach thereof on the part of the bankrupt through the
bankruptcy proceedings. Of this amount $691.86 represented the loss incurred during the first six months of
bankruptcy. Objections filed .by the trustee were sustained by the referee, except as to that portion of the
claim which had accrued prior to the bankruptcy pro-.
ceedings. On review, the District Court sustained this
decision. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the
order of the District Court was reversed, and the cause
remanded with direction to allow $691.86 upon the claim,
and to disallow the.remaining portion. 216 Fed. Rep. 308.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

An appeal to this court by the trustee in bankruptcy
was allowed, under § 25b-2 of the Bankruptcy Act (of
July 1, 1898, c. 541; 30 Stat. 544, 553), upon a certificate
by a Justice of this court that the determination of the
questions involved was essential to a uniform construction
of the Act throughout the United States. This is No. 162.
Thereafter a cross-appeal by the Auditorium Association
was allowed by one of the judges of the Circuit Court of
Appeals. This is No. 174.
A motion is made to dismiss the cross-appeal, and this
must be granted. In the absence of the certificate prescribed by § 25b-2, the sole authority for an appeal from a
decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals allowing or rejecting a claim is found in § 25b-1: "Where the amount in
controversy exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars, and
the question involved is one which might have been taken
on appeal or writ of error from the highest court of a State
to the Supreme Court of the United States." This limits
such appeals to cases where Federal questions are involved,
of the kind described in § 237, Jud. Code. The motion to
dismiss is resisted upon the ground that the claim of the
Association to damages beyond a period of six months was
denied by the Court of Appeals as not constituting a
provable debt in bankruptcy, and that a Federal question
is thus necessarily presented, provability depending upon a
construction of the Bankruptcy Act. An examination of
the opinion of that court, however, shows that while it
held that damages for anticipatory breach of the contract
were provable, it held that the contract itself, because of
the option reserved to the Auditorium Association to
cancel it on six months' notice, was mutually obligatory
for that term only, and hence no damages beyond that
period were allowable. This involved no Federal question.
Chapman v. Bowen, 207 U. S. 89, 92.
But, in view of the general importance of the question of
the amount allowable in its relation to the questions

CENTRAL TRUST CO. v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM.

Opinion of the Court.

involved in the trustee's appeal, we have concluded
that a certiorari should be allowed in lieu of the crossappeal.
Coming to the merits: It is no longer open to question in
this court that, as a rule, where a party bound by an
executory contract repudiates his obligations or disables
himself from performing them before the time for performance, the promisee has the option to treat the contract as ended, so far as further performance is concerned,
and maintain an action at once for the damages occasioned
by such anticipatory breach. The rule has its exceptions,
but none that now concerns us. Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S.
1, 18, 19. And see O'Neill v. Supreme Council, 70 N. J. L.
410, 412. There is no doubt that the same rule must be
applied where a similar repudiation or disablement occurs
during performance. Whether the intervention of bankruptcy constitutes such a breach and gives rise to a claim
provable in the bankruptcy proceedings is a question not
covered by any previous decision of this court, and upon
which the other Federal courts are in conflict. It was,
however, held in Lovell v. St. Louis Life Ins. Co., 111 U. S.
264, 274, where a life insurance company became insolvent
and transferred its assets to another company, that a
policy-holder was entitled to regard his contract as terminated and demand whatever damages he had sustained
thereby. And see Carr v. Hamilton, 129 U. S. 252, 256.

S. C., 175 Fed. Rep. 312; besides which a number of cases
arising out of the relation of landlord and tenant are cited:
In re Ells, 98 Fed. Rep. 967; In re Pennewell, 119 Fed. Rep.
139; Watson v. Merrill, 136 Fed. Rep. 359; In re Roth &
Appel, 181 Fed. Rep. 667; Colman Co. v. Withoft, 195
Fed. Rep. 250. Cases of the latter class are distinguishable, because of the "diversity betweene duties which
touch the realty, and the meere personalty." Co. Litt.,
292, b, § 513.
The contract with which we have to deal was not a contract of personal service simply, but was of such a nature
as evidently to require A considerable amount of capital,
in the shape of equipment, etc., for its proper performance
by the Transfer Company. The immediate effect of
bankruptcy was to strip the company of its assets, and
thus disable it from performing. It may be conceded that
the contract was assignable, and passed to the trustee
under § 70a (30 Stat. 565), to the extent that it had an
option to perform it in the place of the bankrupt (see
Sparhawk v. Yerkes, 142 U. S. 1, 13; Sunflower Oil Company v. Wilson, 142 U. S. 313, 322); for although there was
a stipulation against assignment without consent of the
Auditorium Association, it may be assumed that this did
not prevent an assignment by operation of law. Still, the
trustee in bankruptcy did not elect to assume performance,
and so the matter is left as if the law had conferred no such
election.
It is argued that there can be no anticipatory breach
of a contract except it result from the voluntary act of
one of the parties, and that the filing of an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy, with adjudication thereon, is but
the act of the law resulting from an adverse proceeding
instituted by creditors. This view was taken, with respect
to the effect of a state proceeding restraining a corporation
from the further prosecution of its business or the exercise
of its corporate franchises, appointing a receiver, and

CENTRAL TRUST CO. v. CHICAGO AUDITORIUM.

dissolving the corporation, in People v. Globe Ins. CO., 91
N. Y. 174, cited with approval in some of the Federal court
decisions above referred to. In that case, it did not appear that the company was the responsible cause of the
action of the State, so as to make the dissolution its own
act; but, irrespective of this, we cannot accept the reasoning. As was said in Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S. 1, 19:
"Therparties to a contract which is wholly executory have
a right -to the maintenance of the contractual relations up
to the time for performance, as well as to a performance of
the contract when due." Commercial credits are, to a
large extent, based upon the reasonable expectation that
pending contracts of acknowledged validity will be per-formed in due course; and the same principle that entitles
the promisee to continued willingness entitles him to
continued ability on the part of the promisor. In short, it
must be deemed an implied term of every contract .that
the promisor will not permit himself, through insolvency or
acts, of bankruptcy, to be disabled from making performance; and, in this view, bankruptcy proceedings are but
the natural and legal consequence of something done or
omitted to be done by the bankrupt, in violation of his
engagement. It is the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act,
generally speaking, to permit all creditors to share in the
distribution of the assets of the bankrupt, and to leave the
honest debtor thereafter free from liability upon previous
obligations. Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., 236 U. S.549,
554. Executory agreements play so important a part in
the commercial world that it would lead to most unfortunate results if, by interpreting the Act in a narrow sense,
persons entitled to performance of such agreements on the
part of bankrupts were excluded from participation in
bankrupt estates, while the bankrupts themselves, as a
necessary corollary, were left still subject to action for
non-performance in the future, although without the
property or credit often necessary to enable them to per-

form. We conclude that proceedings, whether voluntary
or involuntary, resulting in an adjudication of bankruptcy,
are the equivalent of an anticipatory breach of an executory agreement, within the doctrine of Roehm v. Horst,
supra.
The claim for damages by reason of such a breach is
"founded upon a contract, express or implied," within
the meaning of § 63a-4, and the damages may be liquidated
urider 6 63b. Grant Shoe Co. v. Laird, 212 U. S. 445, 448.
It is true that in Zavelo v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625, 631, we
held that the debts provable under § 63a-4 include only
such as existed at the time of the filing of. the petition.
But we agree with what was said in Ex parte Pollard,
2 Low. 411, Fed. Cas. No. 11,252, that it would be "an
unnecessary and false nicety" to hold that because it was
the act of filing the petition that wrought the breach,
therefore there was no breach at the time of the petition.
And as was also declared in In re Pettingill, 137 Fed.
Rep. 143, 147: "The test of provability under the Act
of 1898 may be stated thus: If the bankrupt, at the time
of bankruptcy, by disenabling himself from performing the contract in question, and by repudiating its obligation, could give the proving creditor the right to maintain at once a suit in which damages could be assessed
at law or in equity, then the creditor can prove in bankruptcy on the ground that bankruptcy is the equivalent
of disenablement and repudiation. For the assessment of
damages proceedings may be directed by the court under
§ 63b (30 Stat. 562)." It was in effect so ruled by this
court in Lesser v. Gray, 236 U. S. 70, 75, where it was said:
("If,as both the bankruptcy and state courts concluded,
the contract was terminated by the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, no legal injury resulted. If, on the
other hand, that view of the law was erroneous, then there
-was a breach and defendant Gray became liable for any
resulting damage; but he wa8 released therefrom by bi*

Opinion of the Court.

discharge." Of course, he could not be released unless the
debt was provable.
We therefore conclude that the -Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the intervention of bankruptcy constituted such a breach of the contract in question as entitled the Auditorium Association to prove its
claim.
The denial of all damages except such as accrued within
six months after the filing of the petition was based upon
the ground that the contract reserved to the Association
an option to revoke the privileges by giving six months'
notice in writing of its election so to do, in which case both
parties were to be released from further liability at the
expiration of the six months. It was held that because
of this the contract was mutually obligatory for that
term only, and uncertain and without force for any longer
term of service in futuro, within the ruling of this court
in Dunbar v. Dunbar, 190 U. S. 340. In that case the
contract was to pay to a divorced wife "during her life,
or until she marries, for her maintenance and support,
yearly, the sum of five hundred dollars"; and it was held
that for instalments falling due after bankruptcy the
husband remained liable, notwithstanding lAis discharge,
on the ground that the wife's claim for such payments
was not provable because of thd impossibility of calculating the continuance of widowhood so as to base a valuation upon it. The court referred to the 1903 amendment
of § 17 of the Bankruptcy Act (32 .Stat. 797) relating to
debts not affected by a discharge, and including among
these a liability for alimony due or to become due for
maintenance or support of wife or child. This, while
enacted after the Dunbar suit was begun, and not applicable to it, was cited as showing the legislative trend
in the direction of not discharging an obligation of the
bankrupt for the support of his wife or children. The
authority of that decision cannot be extended to cover

240 U. S.

such a case as the present. Here the obligation of the
bankrupt was clear and unconditional. The right reserved
to the Auditorium Association to cancel and revoke the
privileges was reserved for its benefit, not that of the
grantee of those privileges. It does not lie in the mouth
of the latter, or of its trustee, to say that its service would
not be satisfactory, and there is no presumption that
otherwise it would have been advantageous to the Association to exercise the option. It results that the decree,
in so far-as it limits the provable claim to a period of six
months after the bankruptcy, must be reversed, and the
cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity
with this opinion.
