MEMORANDUM ON PETITION FOR REHEARING, MARCH

1916.
MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES:

Our decision is limited, of

course, to the particular ordinance before the court;
to the assessment of three quarters determined in the
mode described, and to those who, like the plaintiff in
.error, have suffered from the inequalities that have no
justification in law.

LAMAR v. UNITED STATES.1
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 434.

Motion to dismiss or affirm submitted January 17, 1916.Decided January 31, 1916.

Jurisdiction is a matter of power and covers wrong as well as right
decisions.
The District Court has cognizance of all crimes cognizable under the
authority of the United States and acts equally within its jurisdiction whether it decid6s that the accused is guilty or innocent and
whether its decision is right or wrong.

The objection that an indictment does not charge a crime against the
United States goes only to the merits of the case.
The question in what sense the word officer is used in § 32, Criminal
Code, is not one involving the Constitution of the United States.
The same words may have different meanings as differently used, and

the word officer.may be used in § 32 of the Criminal Code in a different sense from what it is used in the Constitution; and whether
§ 32- covers falsely personating a Congressman and whether a Congressman is a: state or Federal officer are not constitutional questions
which can be made the basis of a direct appeal under Jud. Code, § 241.
Under § 32, Crim. Code, the indictment is not for defrauding, but for
false personation with intent to defraud, and the nature of the fraud
is immaterial.
False personation by telephone of an officer of the United States takes
effect where the hearer is, and whether the speaker is or is not in
the same district where the former is, the District Court of that
district has jurisdiction of. the offense under § 32, Criminal Code.

facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the crime of falsely personating an officer of the
United States, to wit, a member of the House of Representatives, are stated in the opinion.
THE

The Solicitor General for the United Stat~s, in support of the motion:
The court below had jurisdiction to construe the statute.
Its error, if any, in so doing is one over which the Circuit
Court of Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.
The statute and not the Constitution was to be construed.
No constitutional question is involved.
The .alleged constitutional question, if presented, must
be found in favor of the Government. A member of the
House of Representatives is an officer of the Government
of the United States and 'acting under its authority;
members of Congress hold "office"; a'member of Congress is an "officer."

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error was tried and convicted upon an
indictment charging him with having falsely pretended to
be an officer of the Government of tlie United States, to
wit, a member of the House of Representatives, that is to
say, A. Mitchell Palmer, a member of Congress, with
intent to defraud J. P. Morgan & Company and the
United States Steel Corporation. The case is brought
here directly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction because the indictment does not charge a crinle
against the United States, and that the interpretation of
the Constitution was involved in the decision that a
Congressman is an officer of the United States. There
are subsidiary objections stated as constitutional that
the indictment is insufficient and that it does not appear
in what district the crime was committed.
On the matter of jurisdiction it is said that when the
controversy . concerns a subject limited by Federal law,
such as bankruptcy, Grant Shoe Co. v. Laird, 212 U. S.
445; copyright, Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker, 210 U. S.
356; patents, Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., 237 U. S.
479, or admiralty, The Jefferson, 215 U. S. 130, the jurisdiction so far coalesces with the merits that a case not
within the law is not within the jurisdiction of the court.

covers wrong as .well as right decisions. Fauntleroy v.
Lum, 210 U. S. 230, 234, 235. Burnet v. Desmornes, 226
U. S. 145, 147. There may be instances in Which it is

Opinion of the Court.,

hard to say whether a law goes to the power or only to
the duty of the court; but the argument is pressed too far.
A decision that a patent is bad, either on the facts or on
the law, is as binding as one that it is good. The Fairv.
Kohler Die Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25. And nothing can be
clearer than that the District Court, which has jurisdiction
of all crimes cognizable under the authority of the United
States (Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, c. 231, § 24,
second), acts equally within its jurisdiction whether it
decides a man to be guilty or innocent uiider the criminal
law, and whether its decision is right or wrong. The
*objection that the indictment does not charge a crime
*against the United States goes only to the merits of the
case.
As to the construction of the Constitution being in.
volved, it obviously is'not. The question is in what sense
the word 'officer' is used in the Criminal Code of March 4,
1909, c. 321, § 32. The same words may have different
meanings in different parts of the same act and of course
words may be used in a statute in-a different sense from
that in which they are used in the Constitution. Am.
Security & Trust Co. v. Dist. of Col., 224 U. S. 491, 494,
There were fainter suggestions that the defendant's
constitutional rights were infringed because the nature
of the fraud intended was not set forth and because the
State and district wherein the crime was committed were
not proved. The indictment is not for defrauding .but
for personation with intent to defraud; the nature of the
fraud intended is not material and even mighi not yet
have been determined. It is not an indictment for a
conspiracy to commit an offence against the United States,
where the offence intended must be shown to be a substantive clime. It reasonably may be inferred from the
evidence that the defendant was tried in the right State
and district in fact. If so, his constitutional rights were
preserved. The personation was by telephone to a person

in New York (Southern District) and it might be found
that the speaker also was in the Southern District; but if
not,' at all events the personation took effect there. Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 389. These objections
are frivolous and the others have been shown to be unfounded. It follows that the writ of error must be dismissed.

v.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.
No. 194.

Argued January 19, 20, 1916.-Decided January 31, 1916.

Where two employees of the carrier are necessarily working together,
as under the exigencies existing in this case, each has a reasonable
latitude in relying upon statements of the other made in the course
of and as a part of the operation, and if statements made negligently
by one result in injury of the other properly relying thereon, the
latter is not barred from recovering under the Employers' Liability
Act.
The salutary rule, that a party is not entitled to sit silent until after
verdict, and then insist that it shaH be set aside because the trial
court failed to particularly specify in its charge some matter to which
its, attention had not been suitably called, has not been altered by
the local statute .of Minnesota under which errors in rulings and
instructions may be specified on a motion for new trial without
taking exceptions on the trial.
This court concurs in the view expressed by the state Appellate Court
. to the effect that an instruction on the question of contributory
