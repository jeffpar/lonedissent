v.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MINNESOTA.
No. 194.

Argued January 19, 20, 1916.-Decided January 31, 1916.

Where two employees of the carrier are necessarily working together,
as under the exigencies existing in this case, each has a reasonable
latitude in relying upon statements of the other made in the course
of and as a part of the operation, and if statements made negligently
by one result in injury of the other properly relying thereon, the
latter is not barred from recovering under the Employers' Liability
Act.
The salutary rule, that a party is not entitled to sit silent until after
verdict, and then insist that it shaH be set aside because the trial
court failed to particularly specify in its charge some matter to which
its, attention had not been suitably called, has not been altered by
the local statute .of Minnesota under which errors in rulings and
instructions may be specified on a motion for new trial without
taking exceptions on the trial.
This court concurs in the view expressed by the state Appellate Court
. to the effect that an instruction on the question of contributory

negligence of the plaintiff did not conform exactly to the proper
interpretation of the Employers' Liability Act, but that as the mistake was a verbal one whi4 would undoubtedly have been cotrected
had attention been called thereto at the time, which was not done,
and ds defendant was not prejudiced thereby, it was not error
justifying reversal of the judgment.
125 Minnesota, 532, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the. construction and application of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and the
validity of a verdict and judgment recovered thereunder in
a state court, are stated in the opinion.
â€¢ Mr. W. S. Horton, with whom Mr. Blewett Lee was on
the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Humphrey Barton, with whom Mr. John H. Kay
was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to review a judgment recovered
under the Federal Emplyers' Liability Act. There is no
question but that the defendant in error, Fulton M.
Skagg3, was injured while he was engaged in interstate
commarce in the course of his employment by the plaintiff
in error. It is contended that the state court erred in its
,application of the statute to the, facts, both with respect
to the conditions of liability and the measure of damages.
Skaggs had been employed by the Company for about
four years, first in connection with the building and repair
of bridges, and then, for about two years, as a locomotive
fireman. A few days before the accident he began work
as a b:,keman on a freight train, his first run being from
Freeport to Clinton, Illinois, on January 10, 1913. It was
on the retulia trip to Freeport, on January 13, 1913, that
he was injured. The crew consisted of the conductor, the
engineer, the fireman, the rear brakeman, named Buchta,

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

and Skaggs who was head (or forward) brakeman. There
was evidence that Buchta was assigned to the position of
rear breakman because of his greater experience. The
train reached Amboy, an intermediate station, about
two o'clock A. M. It was a dark, cold night. There were
fifteen cars in the train, two of which were to be left at
Amboy.

The train was cut immediately behind these

two cars; the engine with the forward string of cars proceeded northward on the main track to a point beyond a
switch connecting with a passing track to the west; and
the two cars were then pushed back on the passing track
and cut off. The engine with the remaining cars then returned to the main track and backed down in the direction
of the cars which had been left standing on that track.
After backing a short distance, the engine was stopped,
was uncoupled, and was moved forward alone across the

switch leading to the passing track, the purpose being to
return to the passing track and from thence to proceed to a
further track to the west in order to pick up certain other
cars which were to be put into the train. There had not
been left, however, a safe clearance for the engine, and,
when the engine backed to the passing track, Skaggs who
was -riding on the right side at the rear of the tender was
hit by the end of the foremost car left on the main track,
was knocked to. the ground and was run over, this being
the injury of which he complains.
While there is little or no dispute as to these facts, there
is a conflict of testimony as to the relation of Buchta, the
other brakeman, to the occurrence. Omitting various
details of the movements which for the present purpose
need not be considered, and taking the testimony of
Skaggs which the jury was at liberty to believe, these facts

appear: When, after ieaving the two cars on the passing
'track, the engine with the remaining string of cars returned
to the main track and backed down, Skaggs gave the
signal to stop, repeating.a signal which was received, as he

Opinion of the Court.

supposed, from the conductor. At that time Buchta was
somewhere in the yard (he had been lining up switches for
the intended movements) but Skaggs did not see him when
the cars were stopped. Skaggs then went to the depot to
ascertain the meaning of the signal and was told by the
cojnductor that it was necessary to pick up certain other
cars. Returning to the engine, he attempted to uncouple
it from the right-hand side but found this difficult, and
Buchta who was then on the opposite side effected the
uncoupling and said "Go ahead." On Skaggs' signal, the
engine started forward; but Skaggs did not know whether
the cars were left so as to give sufficient clearance for an
engine going into the passing track and asked Buchta as
to this. He did not receive a satisfactory answer; he
stopped the engine, got off, and again asked Buchta .who
replied: "They are clear a mile, go ahead, and if we don't
get out of here the sixteen-hour law will catch us before we
get into Freeport." Skaggs at that time was on the track
at the rear of the tender and not more than a car's length
from the standing car. He then got on the engine, rode up
to the switch, threw the switch, gave the back-up signal,
stepped on the corner of the tender and was looking back
for any signal that might be given by the other brakeman
when he was caught between the rear right-hand side of the
tender and the end of the standing car, as already stated.
It is contended that the state court erred in permitting
a recovery under the Federal statute for the reason that
the injury resulted from Skaggs' own act,, or from an act
in which he participated. The company, it is said, 'cannot be negligent to an employee whose failure of duty and
neglect produced the dangerous condition.' It may be
taken for granted that the statute does not contemplate
a recovery by an employee for the consequences of action
exclusively his own; that is, where his injury does not
result in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the
officers, agents or employees of the employing carrier or

by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its property or equipment. April 22, 1908, 35
Stat. 65. But, on the other hand, it cannot be said that
there can be no recovery simply because the injured employee participated in the act which caused the injury.
The inquiry must be whether there is neglect on the part
of the employing carrier, and, if the injury to -one employee resulted 'in whole or in part' from the negligence
of any of its other employees, it is liable under the express
terms of the act. That is, the statute abolished the
fellow-servant rule. If the injury was due to the neglect
of a co-employee in the performance of his duty, that
neglect must be attributed to the employer; and if the
injured employee was himself guilty of negligence contributing to the injury the statute expressly provides that
it "shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be
diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of
negligence attributable to such employee." See Second
Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 49, 50; Seaboard
Air Line v. Tilghman, 237 U. S. 499, 501. We think that
the argument for the plaintiff in error overlooks the inferences of fact which the jury was entitled to draw.
Thus, the jury could properly regard the two brakemen
as assisting each other in the movement in question.
Such assistance was certainly appropriate, if not absolutely
necessary. The very purpose of having two brakemen
was not to put upon either the entire responsibility.
Working together under the exigencies of such operations,
particularly when conducted in the night time, it was
manifestly contemplated that the one brakeman ,would
supplement the other and not be compelled at the peril
of his rights personally to examine what the other did or
the basis of the reports the other gave. Each had a
reasonable latitude in relying upon the statements of
the other made in the course of the operation and as a
part of it. The Supreme Court of the State said: "It was

ILLINOIS CENTRAL R. R. CO. v. SKAGGS.

Opinion of the Court.

a very dark night, and evidently there was necessity for
haste. If plaintiff's story is true, Buchta was in a position
to know about clearance, while plaintiff was not; and we
.are unable to say plaintiff had not the right to rely upon
his statement in regard thereto." In this we find no error.
When the engine was uncoupled, Skaggs was on the righthand side, while Buchta was on the other side,-the side
of the passing track-a better place to judge the clearance.
The fact that Skaggs asked his questions is itself not
without significance. These questions indicated doubt
on Skaggs' part, while Buchta's reply showed certainty
on his. It was plainly permissible to infer from the testimony that the two men were not in positions of equal
advantage, and Skaggs was entitled to the exercise of
reasonable care on the part of Buchta in olserving and
reporting the position of the cars. As there was evidence
upon which it could be found that Buchta was negligent,
and that thereby injury resulted to Skaggs, it cannot be
said that the recovery in this aspect of the case was contrary to the statute.
But it is urged that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. After stating that if any employee
"was at the time of this accident negligent in the performance of his duty, which negligence was the direct
cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff, then the
defendant
.
would be liable for that negligence,"
and after referring to the "direct conflict of testimony"
with respect to what was said and done by Buchta, the
trial court charged as follows: "Did the employee Buchta
fail to exercise that ordinary and reasonable care which
a prudent person would have exercised under the -circumstances existing At that time? If he did fail to exercise such ordinary and -reasonable care, then he would be
guilty of negligence, and-that negligence in this case would
be the neglig-ence of the defendant rrailway company.
You must determine this question of fact from all of

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

Opinion of the Court.

240 U.S.

the testimony in the case." It was added, in substance,
that if Buchta did not fail to exercise reasonable care the
plaintiff was not entitled to recover. It is contended
that the trial court erred in failing to qualify the instruction quoted, and other statements to the same effect, by
reference to what Skaggs himself did, knew, or was in a
position to know. But in view of the state of the testimony, and the point to which the court's instruction
was addressed, we cannot say that it was in itself erroneous. If the plaintiff in error desired any addition,
amplification or qualification in order to present its point
of view to the jury it should have made appropriate
request therefor. The record does not show that the
plaintiff in error either objected at the time to any statement made by the court to the jury or that it made any
request whatever for instructions. While under the
local statute (General Statutes, Minnesota, Â§ 7830), the
plaintiff in error was permitted (without taking exceptions at the trial) to specify upon a motion for a new trial
alleged errors in the rulings or instructions of the trial
court, we do not find that this statute alters the salutary
rule that a party is not entitled to sit silent until after the
verdict and then insist that it shall be set aside because
of a failure on the part of the trial court particularly to
specify in its charge some matter to which its attention
had not been suitably called. State v. Zempel, 103 Minnesota, 428, 429; Waligora v. St. Paul Foundry Co., 107
Minnesota, 554, 559; Sassen v. Haegle, 125 Minnesota,
441; State v. Sailor, 153 N. W. Rep. (Minn.) 271; Smith
v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 153 N. W. Rep. (Minn.) 513.
This, also, is a sufficient answer to the complaint of the
failure of the trial court to charge the jury with respect
to assumption of risk. There was no request for any
instruction upon this point. So far as these criticisms
are concerned, we are unable to say that any asserted
Federal right was denied by the state court.

ILLINOIS CENTRAL R. R. CO. v. SKAGGS.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The remaining question is with respect to the instructions of the trial court on the subject of contributory
negligence. In the course of these the court fell into the
error of saying that, if Skaggs was negligent, "a comparative amount, depending upon the ratio of his negligence to
the negligence of the defendant, would be considered by
you" (the jury); and, again, that the jury should "take
into consideration his negligence in comparison with the
negligence of the defendant." But the court read the
applicable provision of the statute to the jury and also
said: "The design of this statute seems to be to place the
responsibility for negligence in all cases just where it
belongs, and to make everybody who is responsible for
negligence which produces injury or an accident responsible for that part of it and to the extent to which they
contributed to it, and so the law provides that contributory negligence does not bar a recovery, but that the
damages to which one is entitled are to be reduced in
proportion as his own negligence contributed to bring
about the injury. That is, in a'case like this, if it should be
found that both parties were to blame, that both were
negligent, both the defendant and the plaintiff, then the
defendant company is to be responsible to the extent to
which it was to blame and the plaintiff would be responsible himself to the extent to which he was to blame."
And no request was made for a correction of the firstmentioned parts of the charge. It was recognized by the
Supreme Court of the State that those parts failed to
conform to the correct interpretation of the statutory
rule as defined in Norfolk & Western Rwy. v. Earnest, 229
U. S. 114, 122, and the court quoted what we there said,
as follows; "But for the use in the second instance of the
additional words 'as compared with the negligence of the
defendant' there would be no room for criticism. Those
words were not happily chosen, for to have reflected what
the statute contemplates they should have read 'as corn-

pared with the combined negligence of himself and the
defendant.' We say this because the statutory direction
that the diminution shall be 'in proportion to the amount
of negligence attributable to such employee' means, and'
can only mean, that, where the causal negligence is partly
attributable to him and partly to the carrier, he shall not
recover full damages, but only a proportional amount
bearing the same relation to the full amount as the negligence attributable to the carrier bears to the entire
negligence attributable to both. . . . Not improbably the mistake in the instruction was purely verbal and
would have been promptly corrected had attention been
specially called to it, and possibly it was not prejudicial to
the defendant."
The state court concluded that 'upon the whole instruction no prejudice to defendant resulted.' And in
this view we concur.
Judgment affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 77.

Argued December 1, 2, 1915.--Decided January 31, 1916.

The findings of the Court of Claims in an action at law determine all
matters of fact precisely as a verdict of a jury, and this court cannot
refer to the opinion for the purpose of eking out, controlling or modifying their scope.
Secret arrangements with government officials by which they share in
profits on contracts which they have a voice in awarding are most
reprehensible, and vitiate the contract, justifying its rescission, even
if made by those negotiating the contract on behalf of the contractor
and without the actual knowledge of the latter.
