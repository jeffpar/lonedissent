VARNER v. NEW HAMPSHIRE BANK.
240 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

VARNER v. NEW HAMPSHIRE SAVINGS BANK.
HAINES TILE & MANTEL COMPANY v. SAME.
JACKSON-WALKER COAL & MATERIAL COMPANY v. SAME.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 264, 265, 266.

Argued March 8, 9, 1916.-Decided April 3, 1916.

The essential question in this case being one of fact, and notwithstanding the different conclusions reached by the courts below, this
court after consideration thereof holds that the evidence sustains
the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that there was no
such commencement of building as would give the mechanics' liens
priority over the mortgages on the property within the meaning of
the Kansas statute.
216 Fed. Rep. 721, affirmed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Chester I. Long, with whom Mr. J. A. Brubacher,
Mr. George Gardner and Mr. A. M. Cowan were on the
brief, for appellants:
'The property in controversy was conveyed to the bankrupt on January 3, 1911, and the work of excavating for
the foundation was begun on January 3, 1911, and continued on the morning of January 4, 1911.
Under the Kansas statute, as construed by the Supreme
Court of that State, a building is commenced when work
or labor is begun on the excavation for the foundation,
which in this case was on the morning of January 3, as
found by the Referee and approved by the District Court.
Even if the, bankrupt did the work on January 3 and 4,
1911, with the motive or intent of preferring the mechanic
lien holders to the mortgagees, that cannot affect the

Argument for Appellants.

rights of the mechanic lien holders, who had no notice or
knowledge of such motive or intent.
Mechanic lien claimants are entitled to a lien upon improvements separate from the land, regardless of the
priority of the mortgages.
Under the Kansas Statute of Frauds the oral agreement
that the mortgages should be executed and delivered
concurrently with the execution and delivery of the deed
to the bankrupt and be a first and prior lien upon the
property and that the Kimball mortgage should be prior
to that of Conklin, was void as to the appellant mechanic
lien holders.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a contest for priority between creditors of a
bankrupt. Appellees claim under mortgages upon certain real estate in Wichita alleged to have been recorded
before building operations on the property were commenced. Appellants maintain construction began prior
to recordation and that they are secured by preferred
mechanics' liens created by the Kansas statute. Disagreeing with the District Court but in accord with the
referee's opinion, the Circuit Court of Appeals (216 Fed.
Rep. 721) held that no "such work as amounted to the
commencement of the building within the meaning of the
Kansas statute" was performed prior to the time when the
mortgages were placed on record, and "that what was
done was but a mere pretense at the commencement of a
building, done to defeat bona fide prior liens." And it accordingly adjudged the mortgage creditors entitled to
priority.
The essential question presented is one of fact; and there
is sharp dispute in the testimony. Substantial difficulties
are disclosed but after considering the evidence we think
it sustains the conclusions reached by the Circuit Court
of Appeals; and the judgment entered there is accordingly
Affirmed.
