LOOMIS v. LEHIGH VALLEY R. R.
240 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

LOOMIS v. LEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

No. 106.

Argued December 6, 1915.-Decided January 24, 1916.

The purpose of the Act to Regulate Commerce was to secure and
preserve uniformity, and the courts may not, as an original question,
exert authority over subjects which primarily come within the
jurisdiction of the Commission.
The character of equipment which the carrier must provide and allowances which it must make for instrumentalities supplied, and services
rendered, by the shipper-such as inside doors and bulkheads in
cars and timber therefor-are problems which directly concern rate
making and are peculiarly administrative on which there should be
an appropriate inquiry by the Interstate Commerce Commission
before being submitted to a court.
The opinions of the Interstate Commerce Commission on questions
in regard to allowances to shippers for doors and bulkheads indicate
that these problems are complicated and administrative.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended by
the Hepburn Act, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Edward P. White, with whom Mr. John Colmey
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The judgment presents a Federal question, because it
is founded upon an erroneous construction of certain
Federal statutes, and upon nothing else.
It was the common-law duty of the defendant to furnish
the lumber in suit.
The common-law duty asserted .by the plaintiffs is
reaffirmed by ยง 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the

liability of the defendant is necessarily implied by ยง 15,
and the common-law remedy is expressly saved by
ยง 22.
The common-law duty asserted in this action was enforceable at the place of shipment by the courts of New
York, whatever the destination of the freight.
The alleged defense is without foundation.
The judgment under review, so far as it reverses part
of the original judgment, should itself be reversed, in
other respects it should be affirmed, and the original
judgment should in all things be affirmed.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

128, 13.1; St. L., 1. M. & So. Ry. v. Taylor, 210 U. S.
281.
Mr. Lyman M. Bass, with whom Mr. Daniel J. Kenetick and Mr. Thomas R. Wheeler were on the brief, for
defendant in error:
No question is presented for review to this court because the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York
State does not deny any right, privilege or immunity
specially set up or claimed by the plaintiffs in error under
any statute of the United States.
The courts of the State of New York had no jurisdiction
over the interstate shipments involved since Congress had
legislated upon the field covering such interstate transportation and had assumed exclusive jurisdiction thereof.
The courts of the State of New York have not jurisdiction to nor should this court direct that the defendant
in error make a payment to the plaintiffs in error in
violation of the specific provisions of the Interstate
Commerce Act.
The Interstate Commerce Commission under the
Interstate Commerc& Act has the exclusive jurisdiction
to determine whether or not the practice of the defendant
in error was discriminatory and unjust in failing to provide in its tariffs for allowances to shippers for lumber
furnished for grain doors or bulkheads and until the
Interstate Commerce Commission had acted, no court,
state or Federal, had any jurisdiction to require the
railroad to pay shippers for such lumber so furnished.
Defendant after the passage of the Hepburn Act owed
no common-law duty to furnish grain doors and bulkheads for interstate shipments without extra charge,
and consequently there is no obligation on its part to
reimburse the plaintiffs for lumber furnished by them for
that purpose without. its request unless provisions therefor were made in its tariffs.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of

the court.
Plaintiffs in error have long been shippers of grain and
produce over the line of defendant carrier from Victor and
other stations in Western New York. From time to time
during a period beginning in August, 1906, and ending

LOOMIS v. LEHIGH VALLEY R. R.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

May 6, 1908, they requested it to furnish at such places
for their use one or more cars-about two hundred altogether-suitable for transporting in bulk, wheat, oats,
rye, apples, cabbages and potatoes. In response, it sent
ordinary box and refrigerator cars inadequate for the
required service until fitted with inside doors or transverse bulkleads. Prior to 1906, in like circumstances,
the custom was for the railroad to supply lumber without
charge and shippers constructed these temporary fittings.
This practice was discontinued at the stations mentioned,
and, during the period specified, it refused either to supply
such material or cars completely prepared for carrying
in bulk the enumerated -articles. Plaintiffs were therefore compelled to construct inside doors or bulkheads in
the car, which they loaded and delivered to defendant
for transportation to points both within and beyond the
State. The total cost of material used was $322.07-it
varied from forty cents to three dollars and fifty cents
per car.
Payment of the amount so expended was demanded
by plaintiffs and refused. Without preliminary resort
to the Interstate Commerce Commission, they then
brought this action in a state court upon the theory that
the carrier having failed to perform its common-law duty
to furnish adequate cars, they were entitled to recover
as damages their consequent outlay. Defendant denied
liability and further' challenged the court's jurisdiction
over claims incident to interstate shipments because:
It was and remains an interstate carrier subject to the
Act to Regulate Commerce as amended and supplemented
as well as the act of Congress passed February 19, 1903,
known as the Elkins Act, etc.; it had filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission the tariffs under which
such shipments were made; these tariffs fixed rates for
transportation only and did not provide for payments
or allowances for grain doors, bulkheads, or lumber for

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

constructing the same; the rates were reasonable and
just and had not been held otherwise by the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
The Court of Appeals held that the common law imposed upon the railroads the duty of furnishing cars
equipped with inside doors, or bulkheads for transporting
grain or provisions in bulk and unless local or Federal
statutes had established different rules plaintiffs were
entitled to recover. Having considered the statutes,
it concluded the local act created no bar to recovery on
account of the intrastate shipments, but that Congress
had assumed such control over interstate shipments as to
deprive the state courts of power to consider claims arising
out of them. 208 N. Y. 312. The judgment of the Appellate Division in favor of plaintiffs for total cost of material
supplied by them was modified accordingly and the record
and proceedings remitted to the Supreme Court, Ontario
County. This writ of error was then sued out to obtain
a review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, being
addressed to the Supreme Court because the record was
in its possession. Shanks v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R.,
239 U. S. 556.
No serious dispute exists concerning the facts. The
applicable duly-filed interstate rate schedules made no
reference to allowances for grain doors or bulkheads, and
the circumstances under which these were installed, together with their cost, are not controverted. Whether
there was jurisdiction in the state court to pass upon the
carrier's liability incident to the interstate traffic, is the
sole point demanding consideration.
The effect of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as supplemented and amended, upon the jurisdiction of courts,
has been expounded in many cases heretofore decided.

Co. v. Penna. R. R., 230 U. S. 304; Minnesota Rate Cases,
230 U. S. 352; Tex. & Pac. Ry. v. American Tie Co.,

121; Penna. R. R. v. Clark Coal Co., 238 U. S.456.
Speaking through Mr. Justice Lamar in Mitchell Coal
Co. v. Penna. R. R., supra, we said (p. 255); "The courts
have not been given jurisdiction to fix rates or practices
in direct proceedings, nor can they do so collaterally
during the progress of a lawsuit when the action is based
on the claim that unreasonable allowances have been paid.
If the decision of such questions was committed to different courts with different juries the results would not only
vary in degree, but might-often be opposite in characterto the destruction of the uniformity in rate and practice
which was the cardinal object of the statute."
In the Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, we further said
(p. 419): "The dominating purpose of the statute was to
secure conformity to the prescribed standards through the
examination and appreciation of the complex facts of
transportation by the body created for that purpose;
and, as this court has repeatedly held, it would be destructive of the system of regulation defined by the
statute if the court without the preliminary action of the
Commission were to undertake to pass upon the administrative questions which the statute has primarily
confided to it."
And in Tex. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. American Tie Co., supra,
the rule was thus stated (p. 146): "It is equally clear that
the controversy as to whether the lumber tariff included
crossties was one primarily to be determined by the Commission in the exercise of its power concerning tariffs
and the authority to regulate conferred upon it by the
statut6. Indeed, we think it is indisputable that that
subject is directly controlled by the authorities which
establish that for the preservation of the uniformity which

it was the purpose of the Act to Regulate Commerce to.
secure, the courts may not as an original question exert
authority over subjects which primarily come within the
jurisdiction of the Commission..
An adequate consideration of the present controversy
would require acquaintance with many intricate facts of
transportation and a consequent appreciation of the
practical effect of any attempt to define services covered
by a carrier's published tariffs, or character of equipment
which it -must provide, or allowances which it may make
to shippers for instrumentalities supplied and services
rendered.. In the last analysis the instant cause presents
a problem which directly concerns rate-making and is
peculiarly administrative. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Ry.v. United States, 232 U. S. 199, 220. And the preservation of uniformity and prevention of discrimination render
essential some appropriate ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission before it may be submitted to a court.
See Penna. R. R. v. Puritan Coal Co., supra, pp. 128, 129;
Penna. R. R. v. Clark Coal Co., supra, pp. 469, 470.
If in respect 'of interstate business the courts of New
York may determine, as original matters, rate-making
problems, those in other States have like jurisdiction.
The uncertainty and confusion which would necessarily
result, is manifest. Ample authority has been given the
Commission, in circumstances like those here shown, to
administer proper relief, and in connection therewith to
approve some general rule of action. In so doing it would
effectuate the great purpose for which the statute was
enacted.
On June 1, 1908, before this proceeding was begun, the
Interstate Commerce Commission ruled: "A carrier may
not lawfully reimburse shippers for the expense incurred
in attaching grain doors to box cars unless expressly so
provided in its tariff." (Conference Ruling No. 78.) In
National Lumber Ass'n v. Railroad, 14 I. C. C. 154,

KANSAS CITY RY. v. McADOW.
240 U. S.

Syllabus.

June 23, 1908, after much consideration, the Commission
refused to order carriers either to furnish flat cars equipped
in all respects for transporting lumber or grant allowances
for cost incurred by shippers in connection therewith. In
N. Y. Shippers' Ass'n v. N. Y. Central R. R., 30 I. C. C.
437 (1914), the regulations and practices of railroads in
Western New York with respect to car fittings used in
bulk transportation of grain and produce, were challenged. The shippers claimed, "it is the carrier's duty to
supply cars at all seasons of the year fully equipped for
the safe transportation of grain, potatoes, and other
produce in bulk without further fitting; or, that if a car
bc tendered the shipper which cannot safely be used for
such commodities, in view of their nature or of the condition of the weather, it is the carrier's duty to furnish,
or to pay for, all materials and labor necessary to render
the car reasonably safe." This was denied. The opinions
in these causes strikingly indicate the complicated administrative problem involved.
We find no error in the judgment below and it is
Affirmed.
