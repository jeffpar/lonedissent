MAYFLOWER FARMS, INC. v. TEN EYCK, COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRI-

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME. COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 349.

Argued January 15, 1936.-Decided February 10, 1936.

1. The New York Milk Control Act, as amended effective April 1,
1934, discriminates between milk dealers without well-advertised
trade names who were in the business before April 10, 1933, and
those in that class who entered it later, by granting to the
former and denying to the latter the privilege of selling milk in
New York City at a price one cent below the minimum.binding on
competitors with well-advertised trade names. Held that the discrimination is arbitrary and unreasonable and violates the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 271.
2. This provision, on its face, is not a regulation of a business
in the interest of, or for the protection of, the public, but
an attempt to give an economic advantage to those engaged in. a
given business at an arbitrary date as against all those who entered
the business after that date. No reasons for the discrimination are
disclosed by the record; and in the absence of such showing the
Court has no right to conjure up possible situations which might
justify the discrimination. Pp. 272, 274.
3. The question whether the time limitation found unconstitutional
is severable from the provision for the price differential, is left for
adjudication by the state courts upon remand of the case. P. 274.
Reversed.

Argument for Appellant.

Mr. Seymour Ellenbogen, with whom Mr. Max Cohen
was on the brief, for appellant.
The purpose of, the time limitation is to create a
monopoly, by preventing new dealers from entering the
field. It was not intended to prevent new and injurious
competition; such competition was and is directly and
effectively prevented by ยง 258-c of the Act, which the
court below overlooked. It was not enacted to preserve
the status quo of the milk dealers in business orl April
10, 1933, or upon the ground that the well-advertised
deaiers would form unadvertised subsidiaries: or on.emergency grounds.
It cannot be supported as a legitimate exercise of police
power. Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 137; Colon v.
Lisk, 153 N. Y. 188, 196; Wright v. Hart, 182 N. Y. 330.
To prescribe -different qualifications for entrance into
the business, or to prescribe regulations covering the different classes, is entirely different from proscribing, in
effect, the right to engage in such business altogether.
This case is like Connolly v..Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184
U. S. 540; Truax v. Corrigan,257 U. S. 312. The limitation is not based on any factual situation. It is an unusual legislative expedient and its approval will establish a most dangerots precedent.
To concede the validity of the time limitation would
be to concede the power of the legislature, in the guise of
regulation, to destroy a lawful business-a; power which
this Court has declared in many cases does not exist.

Jr., Attorney General of New York, and Mr. Henry Epstein, Solicitor General, were on the brief, for appellees.
There was good reason for limiting the privilege of selling at the "unadvertised" price to dealers who were in

Argument for Appellees.

business on April 10, 1933, -when the original Milk Control Law was enacted. The classification is not unconstitutional.
For the purpose of testing the narrow question of constitutionality involved in this case, it is necessary to examine the facts underlying the statute. The legislature
did not wish to increase and intensify the lower-price competition against the "advertised" dealers by permitting
new dealers to join it; and if persons and corporations
wanted to make investments in the milk business after
April 10, 1933, they were required to attach themselves to
the higher-price group.
New legislation frequently makes important distinctions with relation to its effective date, and such classification, far from being arbitrary and unfair, often is necessary to protect from an unfair burden those who began
business before the statute was contemplated. Sperry &

pose of extending to the appellant and other new dealers
the benefit of the "unadvertised differential" provision.
The legislature was moved by the anticipated hardship of an even price, upon dealers whose existing businesses depended upon continuing sales at a lower price,
to make them a concession which this Court has said is
"novel, if not unique." Borden's Farm Products Co. v.
Baldwin, 293 U. . 194, 203. The legislature made the
concession only to the extent that it was needed. It
intended merely to save existing business done on the
lower price level; it had no intention of encouraging new
dealers to come in on that basis.
The statute now under consideration contains a separability clause; but we do not understand that such a
clause is conclusive upon all questions of separability.
Such a clause is "but an aid to interpretation and not an
inexorable command." Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U. S. 286,
290; Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U. S. 235, 242;
Utah Power & Light Co. v. Plost, 286 U. S. 165, 184;

The general rule as to separability has been stated and
applied many times. See, for examples, Sprague v.
Thompson, 118 U. S. 90, 94-95; Connolly v. Union Sewer
Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 565; Lynch v. United States,

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The appellant is a corporation formed under the laws
of New York, pursuing the business of a milk dealer
in Brooklyn. It did not enter the business until the
autumn of 1933, when it applied for, and was granted,

MAYFLOWER FARMS v. TEN EYCK.

Opinion of the Court.

a license under the Milk Control Act of March 31, 1933.
The statute having been renacted for the year commencing April 1, 1934, the company, on April 16, 1934, sought
a license under the new act. After a hearing the application was denied. The Supreme Court granted a certiorari
order, and upon that order and the return the Appellate
Division confirmed the order of the Department of Agriculture and Markets refusing a license, and this action
was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
The Milk Control Act of 1933,' authorized a board to
fix minimum prices for sales of fluid milk in bottles by
dealers to stores in cities of more than one million inhabitants, with a differential of one cent per quart in favor
'
of dealers "not having a well advertised trade name. 2
The term of the act was one year. An amended act, effective April 1, 1934,' which placed milk control under the
jurisdiction of a division of the Department of Agriculture and Markets, contained a similar provision with
respect to the differential. The pertinent section, as it
stood at the time of the appellant's application for a
license, follows; the words in brackets having been in the
original act, but eliminated when the statute was revised
in 1934, those in italics having been added by the later
act:
"It shall not be unlawful for any milk dealer who [at
the time this act shall take effect is] since April tenth,
nineteen hundred thirty-three has been engaged continuously in the business of purchasing and handling milk
not having a well. advertised trade name in a city of more
than one million inhabitants to sell fluid milk in bottles
to stores in such city at a price not more than one cent
per quart below the price of such milk sold to stores under

a well advertised trade name, and such lower price shall
also apply on sales from stores to consumers; provided
that in no event shall the price of such milk not having
a well advertised trade name, be more than one cent per
quart below the minimum price fixed [by the board] for
such sales to stores in such a city." '
The appellant had not a well-advertised trade name.
The reason for refusing it a license was that though it
had not been continuously in the business of dealing in
milk since April 10, 1933 it had sold and was selling to
stores milk at a price a cent below the established minimum price. The question is whether the provision denying the benefit of the differential to all who embark in
the business after April 10, 1933, works a discrimination
which has no foundation in the circumstances of those
engaging in the milk business in New York City, and is
therefore so unreasonable as to deny appellant the equal
protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The record discloses no reason for the discrimination.
The report of the committee, pursuant to which the Milk
Control Act was adopted, is silert on the subject. While
the legislative history indicates that the differential provision was intended to preserve competitive conditions
affecting the store trade in milk, it affords no clue to the
genesis of the clause denying the benefit of the differential to those entering the business after April 10, 1933.
The Court of Appeals thought a possible reason for the
time limitation might be that, without it, the companies
having well advertised names could, through subsidiaries,
sell milk not bearing their names in competition with
unadvertised dealers and thus drive some of the latter

Opinion of the Court.

out of the field with consequent injury to the farmers who
sell them milk. This view ignores the fact that the purchase price to the farmer is fixed and that the introduction of new unadvertised brands of bottled milk would not
reduce the total demand for fluid milk in the metropolitan
area. The appellees do not attempt now to support the
provision on this ground.
Another suggested reason for the discrimination is that
the legislature believed an equal price basis for all dealers
would cause most of the business of selling milk through
stores to pass into the hands of the large and well known
dealers; the differential provision was designed to prevent
this result, and save existing businesses of the independent dealers, but was limited in its scope by the reason for
it; the legislature did not wish to increase the lower
price competition against well advertised dealers by permitting new independent dealers to go into the business,
and so required persons or corporations desiring to make
investments in the milk business after April 10, 1933 to
attach themselves to the higher price group. This is, but
another way of saying the legislature determined that
during the life of the law no person or corporation. might
enter the business of a milk dealer in New York City.
The very reason for the differential was the belief that
no one could successfully market an unadvertised brand
on an even price basis with the seller of a well advertised
brand. One coming fresh into the field would not possess
such a brand and clearly could not meet the competition
of those having an established trade name and good will,
unless he were allowed the same differential as others in
his class. By denying him this advantage the law
effectually barred him from the business.
We are referred to a host of decisions to the effect that
a regulatory law may be prospective in operation and may
except from its sweep those presently engaged in the calling or activity to which it is directed. Examples are stat-

utes licensing physicians aud dentists, which apply only
to those entering the profession subsequent to the passage of the act and exempt those then in practice, or zoning laws which exempt existing buildings, or laws forbidding slaughter houses within certain areas, but excepting
existing establishments. The challenged provision is
unlike such laws, since, on its face, it is not a regulation
of a business or an activity in the interest of, or for the
protection of, the public, but an attempt to give an
economic advantage to those engaged in a given business
at an arbitrary date as against all those who enter the
industry after that date. The appellees do not intimate
that the classification bears any relation to the public
health or welfare generally; that the provision will discourage monopoly; or that it was aimed at any abuse,
cognizable by law, in the milk business. In the absence
of any such showing, we have no right to conjure up
possible situations which might justify the discrimination.
The classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and denies
the appellant the equal protection of the law.
At the argument we'were asked to hold that if the time
limitation be bad, it is severable, and the provision for the
differential, shorn of it, remains in force; and we were
referred to a section of the act claimed to show the legislature so intended. While we have jurisdiction to decide
the question, it is one which may appropriately be left
for adjudication by the courts of New York, Dorchy v.
Kansas, 264 U. S. 286, 290, 291; Fox Film Corp. v.
Muller, 296 U. S. 207, 209, 210.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

C.,mozo, J., dissenting.

A minimum price for fluid milk was fixed by law in
April, 1933. At that time, "independents" were underselling their competitors, the dealers in well-advertised
brands, by approximatery a cent a quart. There was
reason to believe that unless that differential was preserved, they would be driven out of business. To give
them an opportunity to survive, the lawmakers maintained the differential in the City of New York, the field
of keenest competition. We have learned from the opinion in Borden's case that this might lawfully be done.
The problem was then forced upon the lawmakers, what
were to be the privileges of independents who came upon
the scene thereafter? Were they to have the benefit of
a differential though they had not invested a dollar in
the milk business at the passage of the act, or were they
to take the chances of defeat by rivals stronger than themselves, as they would have to do in other callings? "The
Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a business
against the hazards of competition." Hegeman Farms
Corp. v. Baldwin, 293 U. S. 163, 170; Public Service
Comm'n v. Great Northern Utilities Co., 289 U. S. 130,
135. To concede the differential to newcomers might
mean an indefinite extension of an artificial preference,
thereby' aggravating the handicap, the factitious barrier
to expansion, for owners of established brands. There
was danger that the preference would become so general
as to occupy an unfair proportion of the field, the statutory norm being thus disrupted altogether. On the other
hand, to refuse the differential might mean that newcomers would be deterred from putting capital and labor
at the risk of such a business, and, even if they chose to
do so, would wage a losing fight.
Hardships, great or little, were inevitable, whether the
field of the differential was narrowcd or enlarged. The
legislature, and not the court, has been charged with the
duty of determining their comparative extent. To some
minds an expansion of the field might seem the course of

276

297 U.S.

wisdom and even that of duty; to others wisdom and duty
might seem to point the other way. The judicial function is discharged when it appears from a survey of the
scene that the lawmakers did not play the part of arbitrary despots in choosing as they did. Standard Oil Co.
v. Marysville, 279 U. S. 582, 586, 587. When a line or
point has to be fixed, and "there is no mathematical or
logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very
wide of any reasonable mark." Holmes, J., in Louisville
Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 41. Cf.
Dominion Hotel v. Arizona., 249 U. S. 265, 268, 269. The
judgment of the court commits us to a larger r6le. In
declaring the equities of newcomers to be not inferior to
those of others, the judgment makes a choice between
competing considerations of policy and fairness, however
emphatic its professions that it applies a rule of law.
For the situation was one to tax the wisdom of the
wisest. At the very least it was a situation where
thoughtful and honest men might see their duty differently. The statute upheld by this court in ebbia v.
New York, 291 U. S. 502, was an experiment, and a novel
one, in that form of business enterprise. Relations between groups had grown up and crystallized under cover
of the regime of unrestricted competition. They were
threatened with disruption by a system of regulated prices
which might crowd the little dealers out and leave the
strong and the rich in possession of the field. If th'ere
was to be dislocation of the price structure by the action
of the state, there was a duty, or so the.lawmakers might
believe, to spread the consequences among the groups with
a minimum of change and hence a minimum of hardship.
But the position of men in business at the beginning of
the change was very different from those who might go
into the business afterwards. Those already there woald
lose something more than an opportunity for a choice
.between one business and another. They would lose cap-

MAYFLOWER FARMS v. TEN EYCK.

CARDozo, J., dissenting.

ital already ventured; they would lose experience already
bought; they would suffer the pains incidental to the sudden and enforced abandonment of an accustomed way of
life. A newcomer could not pretend that he was exposed
to those afflictions. Then, too, the ephemeral character
of the project counted heavily in favor of the older dealers, and little in favor of a newcomer, or rather, indeed,
against him. The systdm of regulation had been set up
as a temporary one, to tide producers over the rigors of
the great depression. If independents already in the field
could have their business saved from ruin, it might come
back to them. intact when the statute was no longer
needed. Those who went into the system later would
have to count the cost.
Considerations akin to these have seemed sufficient to
other legislatures for drawing a distinction between an
old business and a new one. They have seemed sufficient to this court in determining the validity of other
acts of legislation not different in principle. Stanley v.
Public Utilities Comm'n, 295 U. S. 76, 78; Continental
Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U. S. 352, 370, 371;
Sperry & Hutchinson Co. v. Rhodes, 220 U. S. 502, 505;
Watson v. Maryland, 218 U. S. 173, 177, 178; cf. Spector v.
Buildiig Inspector, 250 Mass. 63, 70, 71; 145 N. E. 265.
Independents who were in business when the statute was
adopted would not have suffered a denial of a constitutional right or privilege if they had been refused a differential, though the refusal might have condemned them
to a foreordained and hopeless struggle with advertised
competitors stronger than themselves. For the same reason, independents starting afterwards must submit to the
same chances unless their equities are as commanding as
those of dealers on the scene before. It is juggling with
words to say that all the independents make up a single
"class," and by reason of that fact must be subjected to
a single rule. Whether the class is divisible into subclasses is the very question to be answered. There may

278

be division and subdivision unless separation can be
found to be so void of rationality as to be the expression
of a whim rather than an exercise of judgment. "We have
no right," it is now said, "to conjure up possible situations which might justify the discrimination." The court
has taught a different doctrine in its-arlier decisions.
"A statutory discrimination will not be set aside as the
denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts
reasonably may be conceived to justify it." Metropolitan
Casualty Insurance Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584;
Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U. S. 342, 357;
O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 282
U. S. 251, 257; Williams v. Mayor, 289 U. S. 36, 42. On
this occasion, happily, the facts are not obscure. Big
dealers and little ones, newcomers in the trade and veterans, were clamorously asserting to the legislature their
title to its favor. I have not seen the judicial scales so
delicately poised and so accurately graduated as to balance and record the subtleties of all these rival equities,
and make them ponderable and legible beyond i reasonable doubt.
To say that the statute is not void beyond a reasonable
doubt is to say that it is valid.
