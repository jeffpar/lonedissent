SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 226.

Argued January 8, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.

1. A loss resulting from the sale in 1926 of securities in respect of
which a distribution pursuant to a plan of reorganization had been
made, held properly determined, for the purpose of computing
income tax under the Revenue Act of 1926, by the method prescribed by Art. 1599 of Treasury Regulations 65, as amended
April 3, 1928, rather than by the original regulation promulgated
August 28, 1926, where the effect of applying the original regulation would be to credit the taxpayer with a loss greatly disproportionate as between the stock in respect of which the distribution
was made and the stock distributed, contrary to the provision of
the statute which requires that the basis shall be "apportioned" between the old and the new stock. P. 132.
2. To apportion is "to divide and assign in just proportion," "to distribute among two or more a just part or share to each." P. 134.
3. The validity of an administrative regulation depends on whether
it is consistent with the statute and reasonable. P. 134.
4. Since the original regulation could not lawfully be applieal in the
circumstances of this case, because inconsistent with the statute
and unreasonable, the amended regulation in effect became the

before the Board of Tax Appeals and disposed of by a
single decision both by the Board and by the Circuit
Court of Appeals.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases involve identical facts and questions of law,
and were disposed of by the court below in one opinion.
76 F. (2d) 892. The facts, so far as they concern the
question here, are taken from the statement of that
court.
"The petitioners are affiliates of United Brokerage
Company. That corporation filed income tax returns for
itself and its affiliates for 1925 and 1926 and the petitioniers seek to review tax deficiencies attributed to them
by the Commissioner, which the Board of Tax Appeals
has affirmed ...
"On June 30, 1925, the United Brokerage Company
purchased for $3,414,345.63 in cash all the capital stock of
Artemas Ward, Inc., [a New York corporation] that wa

issued and outstanding, consisting of 4,964 shares of no
par value ...
"On December 31, 1925, pursuant to a plan of reorganization, Artemas Ward, Inc. (N. Y.) transferred to Artemas Ward, Inc. (a Delaware corporation), in exchange
for 100 shares of stock of the latter company of no par
value, all its assetsj then of a net book value of $1,246,920.07, with the exception of cash and accounts receivable
aggregating $284,967.21; that is to say, the New York
corporation transferred to the Delaware corporation assets
of the value of $961,952.86. Immediately after the transfer, and on December 31, 1925, Artemas Ward, Inc.
(N. Y.) distributed to United Brokerage Company the
100 shares of stock of Artenias Ward, Inc. (Del.) and
accounts receivable amounting to $234,967.21. In December, 1926, United Brokerage sold the entire 4,964
shares of Artemas Ward, Inc. (N. Y.) for $49,640. That
stock had cost the United Brokerage $3,414,345.63 and
the total must be apportioned between the 100 shares of
the Delaware corporation (which it still owns) and the
4,964 shares of Artemas Ward, Inc. (N. Y.) in order
to determine the loss suffered by the United Brokerage Company through its sale of the 4,964 shares at
$49,640.
"Upon the reorganization, the New York corporation
had left among its assets, valued at $1,246,920.07, accounts receivable and cash aggregating $284,967.21, or
approximately 22.85% thereof, after $961,952.86 had
been transferred to the Delaware Company. Under Art.
1599 (2) [as amended, infra,] the portion of $3,414,345.63
paid by the United Brokerage Company for the stock of
Artemas Ward, Inc. (N. Y.) represented by that stock
after the reorganization was $780,303.97. If from this
be deducted $234,967.21 accounts receivable and the
$49,640 realized from the sale in December, 1926, there

would be a loss of $495,696.76. This loss the Commissioner allowed in assessing the income tax for 1925. The
second point raised on this appeal is whether the loss,
for the year 1926, to which the United Brokerage Company and its affiliates were entitled, was only the sum of
$495,696.76 or was the sum of $2,167,785.56 which would
arise through deducting from $3,414,345.63, (the cost of
the stock of the New York company) tne value at the
time of the reorganization of the Delaware stock, which
was $961,952.86 and $234,967.21 realized from accounts
receivable and S49;640 realized from sale of the 4,964
shares."
It thus appears, the New YQrk company having parted
with all its assets except $50,000 in cash, that the assets
behind the 4,964 shares when the 100 share distribution
was made consisted of only that sum, while the 100 shares
of the Delaware company stock was represented by the
transferred assets of the New York company of the value
of $961,952.86. The sale of the 4,964 shares brought
$49,640; and the simple question to be determined is
what method for the purposes of taxation should be employed to determine the loss in respect of the 4,964 shares
under the Revenue Act of 1926, ยง 204 (a) (9), c. 27,
44 Stat. 9, 14, 15. That section provides that the basis
for determining the gain or loss from such sale shall be
the cost of the property, except that"(9) If the property consists of stock or securities distributed after December 31, 1923, to a taxpayer in
connection with a transaction described in subdivision
(c) of section 203,* the basis in the case of the stock in

plan of reorganization, to a shareholder in a corporation a party to
the reorganization, stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in such a corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock or
securities shall be recognized."

Opinion of the Court.

respect of which the- distribution was made shall be apportioned, under rules and regulations prescribed by the
Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary,
between such stock and the stock or securities
distributed; . . ."
At the time of the reorganization, Article 1599 of
Treasury Regulations 69, which had been promulgated
on August 28, 1926, was in force. Petitioners invoke
subdivision 2 of that regulation which provided:
"Where the stock distributed in reorganization is in
whole or in part of a character or preference materially
different from the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the cost or other basis of the old shares of
stock shall be divided between such old stock and the new
stock in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the respective
values of each class of stock, old and new, at the time the
new shares of stock are distributed, and the basis of ea&h
share of stock will be the quotient of the cost or other
basis of the class with which such share belongs, divided
by the number of shares in the class. The portion of the
cost or other basis of the old shares of stock to be attributed to the shares of new stock shall in.no case exceed the
fair market value of such shares as of the time of their
dtstribution." (Italics added.)
April 3, 1928, this regulation was amended by striking
from it the italicized portion. The taxpayer contended
that its loss should be computed in accordance with the
original regulation. This would have resulted in an allocation to the 4,964 shares of the New York corporation
of $2,452,392.77; and, after making certain deductions,
thd allowable loss, as already appears, would have been
something over $2,000,000. The commissioner, however,
proceeding in strict accordance with the amended regulation, determined the amount of loss to be $495,696.76.
Without pursuing the matter in further detail, it is
enough to say that the case turns entirely upon the ques-

Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S

tion whether the loss was to be determined in accordance
with the original or the amended regulation. If in accordance with the former, the taxpayer is right; if in
accordance with the latter, the commissioner is right.
The court below held that the amended and not the original regulation furnished the-applicable rule, and affirmed
the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals, which in
turn had sustained the commissioner. We agree with
that view.
In determining a loss, the statute requires that the
basis shall be "apportioned" between the old and the new
stock. To apportion is to "divide and assign in just proportion," "to distribute among two or more a just part or
share to each," Fisher v. Charter-Oak Life Ins.. Co., 14
Abb. N. C. 32, 36, albeit, a division may be just without
necessarily being also an exactly equal division. The result of applying the original regulation here is to bring
about an inequitable apportionment, contrary to the intent iof the statute, and to credit the taxpayer with a loss
essentially and greatly disproportionate. On the other
hand, application of the amended regulation effectuates
the legislative intent that the basis of apportionment
between the old and the new stock shall result in a fair
and just division.
The power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and
regulations to that end is not the power to make lawfor no such power can be delegated by Congress-but the
power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will
of Congress as expressed by the statute. A regulation
which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out
of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity. Lynch
v. Tilden Produce Co., 265 U. S. 315, 320-322; Miller v.
United States, 294 U. S. 435, 439-440, and cases cited.
And not only must a regulation, in order to be valid, be
consistent with the statute, but it must be reasonable.

Syllabus.

International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, 257 U. S. 506, 514.
The original regulation as applied to a situation like that
under review is both inconsistent with the statute and
unreasonable.
The contention that the new regulation is retroactive
is without merit. Since the original regulation could not
be applied, the amended regulation in effect became the
primary and controlling rule in respect of the situation
presented. It pointed the way, for the first time, for
correctly applying the antecedent statute to a situation
which arose under the statute. See Titsworth v. Commissioner, 73 F. (2d) 385, 386. The statute defines the
rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which such
rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes
only a step in the administrative process. It does not,
and could not, alter the statute. It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determinati6n
construing and applying a statute to a cae in hand.
Judgment affirmed.
