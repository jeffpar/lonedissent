HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. SALVAGE.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 173.

Argued December 20, 1935.-Decided January 13, 1936.

1. Upon appeal from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining a tax assessment, the Circuit Court of Appeals should confine
itself to grounds which were presented to or considered by the
Board. P. 108.
2. Stock of a corporation worth more than par was acquired from
it by the taxpayer upon payment of par value in cash and in
further consideration of an option to the corporation to repurchase
part of the shares at par and of the taxpayer's agreement not to
compete with the corporation in business. Held:
(1) That the taxpayer's failure to report the profit at the
time in his income tax return, due to an innocent mistake, did not
estop him, when measuring the gain from a disposition of the
shares in a later year, from claiming that their market value at
time of purchase was greater than the cash price he had paid for
them. P. 109.
(2) That the market value of the shares subject to the option
of repurchase was necessarily limited to $100 per share. P. 109.
76 F. (2d) 112, affirmed.

MR.

Opinion of the Court.

Jusri.cE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cross writs bring up a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit, which disapproved a deficiency assessment for 1929 income; and authorized
recovery for overpayment below the taxpayer's claim.
The petition for certiorari in No. 173 asserts: "The
question is--Whether the taxpayer is estopped to claim
that the difference between the market value of the 1,500
shares as of December 30, 1922 and their cost to him
constituted taxable income to him for 1922; and hence
that the fair market value of these shares, and not their
cost, is the basis to be used in measuring the gain from
the disposition of the shares in 1929, no income from
the transaction having been reported in 1922."
The points to be urged in No. 280 are stated thus-"The Circuit Court of Appeals erred: (1) In holding
that the cost base of the preferred stock of American
Viscose Corporation redeemed in 1929 was to be arrived
at by taking as the fair market value of The Viscose
Company stock the sum of $100 per share, insofar as the
five-sevenths of said stock which was subject to the option to repurchase was concerned. (2) In making a finding as to the value of said optioned stock."
Prior to 1922, Salvage, the taxpayer, bought twentyfive shares, Viscose Company stock. He paid $166.66 for
each one-for all $4166.66. In December, 1922, he acquired from the corporation 1500 shares for which he paid
$100 per share ($150,000) and entered into an obligation
to refrain from competing business, etc. Also, he agreed
that during 1923 the corporation might repurchase fivesevenths of 1500 shares at par; during 1924, foursevenths, etc. Intrinsically (when unincumbered) a share
of the company stock was then worth $1164.70.
Later during 1922, all these shares (1525) were exchanged for 6100 preferred shares, redeemable at $110,

and 7625 common shares, American Viscose Corporation.
The basis of exchange was four preferred and five common
shares of new stock for one share of old. The taxpayer's
return for 1922 (not in evidence) showed no gain from
these transactions.
During 1929, American Viscose Corporation redeemed
its preferred shares at $110; Salvage received $671,000.
His return for that year disclosed as net capital gain the
difference between that sum and $154,166.66, total outlay
for the 1525 converted shares. Upon' this, he paid the
assessed tax. Apparently, he supposed apportionment between preferred and common stock of their total cost was
impossible or unnecessary; also that no taxable gain arose
before return of his entire outlay.
Upon an audit, the Commissioner ruled that proper apportionment of the total cost-$154,166.66-could be
made. He assigned thirty-seven + per cent. to the preferred and sixty-two + per cent. to the common shares
and made a deficiency assessment of $12,005.38. Thereupon, the taxpayer claimed, first that in 1922 each Viscose
Company share was fairly worth $1164.70 and with that
as the base, no taxable gain arose upon redemption of
the preferred stock. Also that he had overpaid to the
extent of $63,750. Second, that apportionment of the
cost of both between preferred and common shares was
impracticable and no taxable gain could arise prior to
recovery of the full outlay.
Upon these conflicting claims, the Board of Tax Appeals took the matter. There the Commissioner asserted
correctness of his action; he presented no affirmative defense; set up no claim of estoppel because of the taxpayer's failure properly to report 1922 gain.
The Board held the difference between the true value
of Viscose Company. shares and the price paid by the taxpayer was not compensation for services; also that the

deficiency assessment was properly made. Estoppel was
neither presented nor considered.
The court below held that the consideration for the Viscose Company stock acquired in 1922 was.$100 per share,
plus the covenants to resell five-sevenths at par, etc. and
not to engage in competing business. Also that the base
cost for estimating capital gain in 1929 was the fair market value in 1922 of the shares then held. And since the
corporation had the right to repurchase at par, the market value of- five-sevenths did not exceed $100 per share.
Further, that the failure to disclose 1922 taxable gain apparently resulted from innocent mistake of law; there was
no false representation of fact; nothing gave support to
the claim of estoppel. The cause was remanded for ascertainment of the amount of the overpayment.
We find no reason to disagree with the judgment of the
court.
The defense of estoppel was not before the Board. Under what we regard as the correct practice, General Utilities & OperatingCo. v. Helvering, 296 U. S. 200, the court
should have passed the point. Furthermore, the facts disclosed give it no support.
Considering the option to repurchase at par, outstanding in 1922, there could be no proper finding of fair market value at that time in excess of $100 per share. In the
circumstances, the court did not err in so holding.
Pertinent Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial
opinions are adequately pointed out by the court's
opinion.
The judgment is affirmed. The cause will be remanded
for further proceedings.
Affirmed.
