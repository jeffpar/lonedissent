In such cases the complainant, because the valuation is
too high or too low, suffers a harm from which the Constitution guarantees immunity. But the Constitution
guarantees no immunity from taxation even though the
tax, because of its amount, may be burdensome, see Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, or because it is as high in a
year of depression and falling property values as in years
of prosperity. Beyond this, petitioner does not show
that it is harmed, or present any case for invoking the
protection of the Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

Mr. Warren E. Miller, with whom Mr. A. H. Culwell
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SToi- delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case was brought here on certiorari to review a
determination of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit, said to be inconsistent with our decision in Miller
v. United States, 294 U. S. 435. The challenged holding
is that there is statutory authority for including in contracts of United States government insurance (converted
war risk insurance) covering death or total permanent
disability a provision that "the permanent loss of hearing of both ears . . . shall be deemed to be total disability." The case was tried in the district court to a
jury which rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, respondent here. Judgment in his favor was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 76 F. (2d)
564, which held that the insertion in the policy of the
quoted definition of total disability, pursuant to Veterans' Administration Regulation, § 3122, was authorized
by 43 Stat. 624, 1309, 38 U. S. C., § 512.'
The government, by its assignment of errors here,
assails, as it did in the court below, the correctness of
1,,§ 512. Not later than July 2, 1926, all term insurance held by
persons who were in the military service after April 6, 1917, shall be
converted, without medical examination, into such form or forms of
insurance as may be prescribed by regulations and as the insured may
request. Regulations shall provide for the right to convert into
ordinary life, twenty-payment life, endowment maturing at age sixtytwo, and into other usual forms of insurance, . . . Provisions for

maturity at certain ages, for continuous installments during the life
of the insured or beneficiaries, or both, for cash, loan, paid up and
extended values, dividends from gains and savings, and such other
provisions for the protection and advantage of and for alternative
benefits to the insured and the beneficiaries as may be found to be
reasQnable and practicable, may be provided for in the contract of
"
insurance, or from time to time by regulations.

Opinion of the Court.

this ruling, but examination of the record discloses that
no such objection was presented to the trial court. In
consequence the government is precluded from raising
the question on appeal.
The trial judge instructed the jury that respondent
might recover either on the theory that his loss of hearing
constituted in fact a permanent disability preventing his
pursuit of any substantially gainful occupation, or that
his loss of hearing of both ears, if permanent, was a permanent disability as defined by the policy. The jury was
thus left free to return a verdict for respondent if it found
that he had suffered permanent loss of hearing of both
ears, regardless of its effect upon his ability to earn his
livelihood. The government failed to question the correctness of these instructions either by exception or request
to charge, and its motion for a directed verdict was upon
other grounds not now material.
The verdict of a.jury will not ordinarily be set aside for
error not brought to the attention of.the trial court. This
practice is founded upon considerations of fairness to the
court and to the parties and of the public interest, in
bringing litigation to an end after fair opportunity has
been afforded to present all issues of law and fact. Beaver
v. Taylor, 93 U. S. 46; Allis v. United States, 155 U. S.
117, 122, 123; United States v. United States Fidelity &
Guaranty Co., 236 U. S. 512, 529; Guerini Stone Co. v.
Carlin Construction Co., 248 U. S. 334, 348; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Minds, 250 U. S. 368, 375; Burns v. United
States, 274 U. S. 328, 336; see Shannon v. Shaffer Oil &
Refining Co., 51 F. (2d) 878, 880. It is substantially
that adopted by Rule 10, Subdivision 1, of the rules of the
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which requires the
party excepting to the charge "to state distinctly the several matters of law" to which he, excepts, and directs that
"those matters of law, and those only, shall be inserted
in the bill of exceptions."

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Statement of the Case.

297 U.S.

In exceptional circumstances, especially in criminal
cases, appellate courts, in the public interest, may, of their
own motion, notice errors to which no exception has been
'taken, if the errors are obvious, or if they otherwise seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of
judicial proceedings. See New York Central R. Co. v.
Johnson, 279 U. S. 310, 318; Brasfield v. United,States,
272 U. S. 448, 450. But no such case is presented here.
The judgment must be affirmed for the reason that the

error assigned was not made the subject of appropriate
exception or request to charge upon the trial.
Affirmed.
