OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Counsel for Parties.

297 U.S.

state commerce, the company presented accounts which,
as the trial court found, show that in the year 1933, the
intrastate business resulted in a net operating deficit of
$192,507. On the other hand to have abandoned the
intrastate business while operating the interstate would
have cost the company gross operating revenues of
$5,271,893. Since the occupation tax challenged is not
shown to be a direct burden upon the company's interstate business, the judgment against it is affirmed.
What has been said above disposes of the contention
of the railroads that the statute violated the due process
clause. It also renders unnecessary consideration of the
additional reasons urged by the State in support of the
judgments of its Supreme Court. On these we express
no opinion.
Affirmed.

LEAHY v. STATE TREASURER.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Leahy brought this action in a court of Oklahoma
against the State Treasurer and others to recover $11.99
paid under protest as state income tax. He is a duly
enrolled member of the Osage ,Tribe of Indians, and has
long held a certificate of competency. As such member
he is entitled to receive, from time to time, his pro rata
share of the income of the restricted mineral resources
of the Tribe held by the United States for the Tribe under
the Act of June 28, 1906, c. 3572, 34 Stat. 539, and later
legislation. The tax challenged is upon such income paid
to him. Leahy claims that it is void because laid by the
State upon a federal instrumentality. The trial court
overruled the contention and entered judgment for the
defendants. On the authority of Choteau v. Burnet, 283
U. S. 691, its action was affirmed by the Supreme Court
of the State, three judges dissenting. 173 Okla. 614; 49
P. (2d) 570. We granted certiorari because of the constitutional question presented.
The facts are substantially the same as those presented
in Choteau v. Burnet, supra, which upheld a .federal income tax on a like payment. The applicable statutes and
decisions are discussed. there. As Leahy was entitled to
have the income paid to him and was free to use it as he
saw fit, no reason appears why it should not be taxable
also by the State.
Affirmed.
