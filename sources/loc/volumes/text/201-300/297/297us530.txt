UNITED STATES v. RIZZO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 272. Argued January 9, 1936.-Decided March 9, 1936.
1. In a suit in admiralty to forfeit a cargo of alcohol for breach of
the customs and navigation laws, a claim of the United States for
internal revenue taxes on the alcohol, being a non-maritime claim,
cannot be set up in the libel; and to defer the presentation of such
claim until after the final decree adjudicating the right to the
property, is therefore not dilatory conduct. P. 533.
2. The basic tax imposed upon distilled spirits is not a penalty; it
is imposed irrespective of the legality of their origin; the lien
attaches when the spirits as such come into existence, continues
until the tax is paid, and is valid against all transferees, without
assessment, distraint, or other administrative proceedings. P. 533.
3. One who claims that alcohol, admittedly not imported, is not sub-ject to tax, must prove payment of the tax. P. 533.
4. The United States, by seeking a forfeiture of distilled Epirits for
violation of the customs and navigation laws, is not estopped,
through election of. remedies, from claiming the tax imposed upon
the spirits by the internal revenue laws. P. 534.
5. An agreement by the United States, in a proceeding by libel to
forfeit distilled spirits, for a judicial sale of the spirits "free and
clear of all claims of any kind or character," and transfer of all
existing liens from property to pr9ceeds, does not waive a lien
on the proceeds for internal revenue taxes. P. 534.
6. The Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in admiralty in a proceeding to forfeit distilled spirits under the customs and navigation
laws, having sbld the spirits free of liens and transferred existing

liens to the proceeds of sale, has jurisdiction to entertain a petition of the Government for satisfaction out of such money in
custodia legis of its lien for internal revenue taxes on the spirits.
P. 535.
7. Denial of a claim by the United States for payment of internal
revenue taxes on distilled spirits out of the proceeds of their sale
in a proceeding by libel for breach of the customs and navigation
laws, held a final judgment for the purposes of review in this
Court,-cases denying- review of merely administrative proceedings
under a decree are inapplicable. P. 536.

CERTIORARI, 296 U. S. 559, to review an order rejecting

a petition by the United States that moneys in the custody of the court below, proceeding from a judicial sale
of alcohol in a forfeiture suit, be paid into the Treasury
in satisfaction of internal revenue taxes.
Mr. Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., with whom Solicitor
General Reed, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and
Mr. George F. Foley were on the brief, for the United
States.
Mr. Milton R. Kroopf, with whom Messrs. Louis Halle
and Samuel I. Kessler were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In December, 1932, a cargo of alcohol was seized by
Customs and Coast Guard officials acting together; and
the United States filed, in the federal court for New Jersey, a libel in admiralty praying forfeiture for violation of
the customs and navigation laws. Rizzo, as claimant, filed
an answer. A decree of forfeiture was entered on the
ground that the cargo was carried on a vessel employed
in a trade other than that for which she was licensed. The
Court of Appeals reversed, citing United States v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217. While the Government's petition for

297 U.S

a rehearing, later denied, was pending, that court ordered,
upon application by Rizzo for sale of the alcohol, that it
be sold, "free and clear of all claims of any kind or character"; that the proceeds be deposited in the registry;
and that they "be substituted in the place and stead of
said 146,157 gallons of alcohol, and that all further proceedings herein shall be against said proceeds of sale."
The marshal sold the alcohol for $1.85 per wine gallon.
In confirming the sale, the court ordered (1) that the alcohol be delivered to the purchaser free of all government
taxes or tax liens and customs duties; (2) that it "shall be
treated by the United States Government and any of its
departments as tax paid, irrespective of the lack of any
stamp or tax. certificate affixed thereto on the respective
containers in which said alcohol may be deposited or contained"; and (3) that the proceeds of sale be paid into
the-fegistry of the court. We denied a writ of certiorari,
sought on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals
lacked authority to include the provision regarding taxes
in its order of confirmation. 294 U. S. 709.
Thereupon, the United States filed in the Circuit Ccurt
of Appeals a petition asking that the proceeds of the
sale be paid into the Treasury of the United States in
satisfaction of the lien for taxes due on the alcohol; made
proof that the taxes exceeded the proceeds of the sale;
and filed with the clerk notices of levy and warrant for
distraint. The court ruled that the petition could not
be entertained, because the Government had failed to
raise the question of taxes when it filed its libel but had
waited until after denial of certiorari to seek such relief.
Accordingly, the Court directed that the proceeds be
paid to the claimant or his assigns.' To review this order
we granted certiorari, a misconstruction of the 'statutes

ceeds in amounts aggregating nearly the whole of the deposit.

Opinion of the Court.

concerning tax liens and a departure from the usual
course of proceedings being charged.
First. Rizzo does not attemjot here to support the order
on the ground stated by the Court of Appeals. Nor could
he well do so. The claim for taxes, being non-maritime,
could not have been set forth in the libel. Compare The
Steamboat Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175, 182. To
defer presenting the claims for taxes until after the final
decree adjudicating the right to the property was not
dilatory conduct. Obviously, there would have been no
occasion to proceed against the property for collection
of the tax if the alcohol had been declared forfeit to the
United States.
Second. Rizzo contends that the tax sought to be
recovered is a penalty imposed for violation of the National Prohibition Act; hence uncollectible, because of the
repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. United States v.
Chambers, 291 U. S. 217. But this tax is not a penalty.
It is the basic tax upon distilled spirits irrespective of
their legal or illegal origin. United States v. One Ford
Coupe, 272 U. S. 321, 328; Various Items of Personal
Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577, 579. A lien attaches to alcohol "as soon as it is in existence as such"
and continues until the tax is paid. Rev. Stat. §§ 3248,
3251; Thompson v. United States, 142 U. S. 471, 474.
That lien is valid against all transferees, without assessment, distraint or other administrative proceedings.
Alkan v. Bean, 1 Fed. Cas. No. 202, p. 418; United States
v. Turner, 28 Fed. Cas. No. 16,548, p. 232.
Rizzo objects here that the alcohol does not appear to
have been of domestic manufacture. His answer in the
District Court stated that it was not imported; and there
is no showing that it was. As the alcohol was subject to
the tax, the burden rested upon him to prove payment.
Rev. Stat. § 3333, as amended. No evidence to that effect
was introduced. The contrary was established.

297 U.S.

Third. Rizzo contends that the United States is estopped from collecting the tax, because it elected to seek
forfeiture for violation of the National Prohibition Act.
But the Government made no such attempt. The libel
sought forfeiture on four grounds. Three of them were
for violation of provisions in the Tariff Act of 1930, June
17, 1930, c. 497, 46 Stat. 590. The fourth was for violation of the navigation laws. Rev. Stat. § 4377. The District Court decreed forfeiture on the fourth ground, without passing on the other three. The petition presented to
the Circuit Court of Appeals has no relation to navigation
or customs laws. It states a claim based solely upon the
internal revenue laws. The present proceeding is thus
founded on a right distinct from, and entirely consistent
with, the rights theretofore asserted. Compare United
States v. One Ford Coupe, 272 U. S. 321, 327, 333-334.
No reference was made in the libel, and no evidence was
introduced in the District Court, with respect to the tax
due upon the domestic production of alcohol. There is
no basis for the contention that the United States is
estopped by an election of remedies. Compare Southern
Pacific Co. v. Bogert, 250 U. S. 483, 490-491.
Fourth. Rizzo contends that the United States is also
barred because its counsel agreed, when the terms of sale
were framed, that the proceeds should be answerable only
to the causes of forfeiture set forth in the libel and that
any tax lien should be waived. There was no such agreement. The notice of the "terms and conditions under
which the sale will be conducted" (to which counsel for
the Government is alleged to have consented) recited:
"3. The cargo .of alcohol which is being sold is to be sold
free and clear of all claims of any kind or character." The
order of sale had provided that "all further proceedings.
herein shall be against said proceeds of sale." Thus it
was in the common form authorized by Admiralty Rule
40, which is interpreted as transferring all existing liens

UNITED STATES v. RIZZO.

Opinion of the Court.

from property to proceeds. Compare The Lottawanna,
20 Wall. 2d1, 211, 221; Schuchardt v. Ship Angelique, 19
How. 239, 241. Since counsel did not agree to waive the
tax lien on the proceeds, and since the Court of Appeals
made no finding of such a waiver, we need not consider
whether a United States Attorney had authority to waive
the Government's right. Compare Utah v. United States,
284 U. S.534, 545-546.
Fifth. Rizzo contends that the Circuit Court of Appeals
sitting in admiralty lacks jurisdiction to enforce the lien
for taxes. The argument is that collection of internal
revenue taxes must be effected in accordance with prescribed statutory methods; and that the Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, § 1115, 44 Stat. 117, and Rev. Stat.
§ 838 provide specifically for collection by the Collector of
Internal Revenue through proceedings specified. But
compare Rev. Stat. § 3213. The order of the appellate
court confirming the sale deprived the Government of
two of the statutory methods. First, the right to forfeit
the alcohol even after it had been transferred to a bona
fide purchaser while in a container not properly stamped.
Act of January 11, 1934, c. 1, Title II, § 206, 48 Stat.
317. Second, the right to collect the taxes from the purchaser under the court's order, Rev. Stat. § 3334, as
amended by Act of March 1, 1879, c. 125, § 5, 20 Stat. 340.
But in ordering sale of the alcohol free of liens, the Court
of Appeals in effect provided, in accord with the common
practice, that existing liens should attach to the proceeds.
Compare Terre Haute & L. Ry. v. Harrison, 96 Fed. 907,
911. These being in custodia legis, it was proper to petition that they be applied towards satisfaction of the tax.
Compare Marshall v. New York, 254 U. S. 380, 3S4-38.5;
In re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164, 182-183, 187. The practice
prevails in admiralty as in other courts. In Schuchardt v.
Ship Angelique, 19 How. 239, 241, where proceeds of the
sale of a mortgaged ship had been paid into the registry,

297 U. S.

the Court, refusing to entertain a "libel simply to foreclose a mortgage, or to enforce the payment of a mortgage," said: "As the fund is in the custody of the admiralty, .the application must necessarily be made to that
court by any person setting up an interest in it. This
application by petition is frequently entertained for proceeds in the registry, in ca ses where a suit in the admiralty
would be wholly inadmissible." Admiralty Rule 42; compare The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 582-583; TheJ. E.
Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1, 15. The practice prevails in appellate courts'as wellas in courts of original jurisdiction.
Compare In re Antigo Screen Door Co., 123 Fed. 249,
251-252.
Sixth. Finally, Rizzo contends that this Court lacks
jurisdiction because the order appealed from does no
more than carry out another order not here for review.
This is not true. The United States seeks to enforce
against property in the possession of the Circuit Court
of Appeals a right which had not theretofore been litigated, and which was not barred by earlier proceedings.
If the Government had been a stranger to the litigation
it would have been entitled to intervene; compare Savannah v. Jesup, 106 U. S. 563, 564-565; Krippendorf v.
Hyde,, 110 U. S. 276, 282-283; Gumbel v. Pitkin, 113
U. S.'545, 547-548; 124 U. S. 131; and a denial of intervention would have been reviewable as a final judgment;
compare Cenitral Trust Co. v. Grant Locomotive Works,
135 U.'S. 207, 224-225; Credits Commutation Co. v.
United States, 177 U. S. 311, 315-316; Clark v. Williard,
292 U. S. 112, 117-119. Its right to have the new issue
adjudicated is not to be denied because it was already a
party to the suit. Compare In the Matters of Howard,
9 Wall. 175, 183. The cases which hold that merely administrative proceedings under a decree may not be
brought here for review have no application. See Wynkoop, H., C. Co. v. Gaines, 227 U. S. 4. Compare Collins

RAL GAS CO.
APPEAL FROM THE

No. 551.

ET AL.

COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

Argued March 4, 1936.-Decided March 16, 1936.

A franchise contract between a city and a gas company provided that
if rates proposed by the company were deemed excessive by the
city, reasonable rates should be prescribed in proceedings before
a state commission; that pending such proceedings and any subsequent proceedings in court, the company should charge specified temporary rates, part of the collections from which should
be impounded; and that, upon the final fixation of rates, the
impounded sums should be distributed, under order of the commission or of the court, to the company or to its several customers,
as the final determination should direct. Pursuant to these provisions, proceedings were brought and litigated, but, while they were
pendirg, the city and the company compromised their differences
by agreeing upon a rate for the future and by providing for distribution of the impounded sums. Upon appeal from a judgment of
the state court upholding the compromise over objections by customers who claimed that their rights in the fund were thereby
infringed in violation of the contract clause of the Constitution and
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,-held
1. That this Court, in adjudicating these constitutional claims,
will examine for itself the franchise contract and the impounding
proceedings. P. 542.
2. The customers had no vested rights preventing the cMty from
making the compromise agreement. Id.
3. In making the settlement, as well as in making the original
franchise contract, the customers were represented by the city.
Id.
260 Ky. 361; 85 S. IV. (2d) 870, affirmed.
