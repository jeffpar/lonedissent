UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 33.

Argued January 16, 17, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.

1. Whether a transportation agency is a common carrier depends not
upon its corporate character or declared purposes, but upon what
it does. P. 181.
2. The State Belt Railroad, owned by the State of California and
operated by it along the waterfront of San Francisco harbor, which
receives all freight cars, loaded and empty, offered to it by railroads, industrial plants and steamships, with which it connects, and
hauls them at a fiat rate per car, the larger part of such traffic
having its origin or destination in States other than California, is
a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce. P. 182.
3. In operating a common-carrier railroad in interstate transportation,
though the purpose be to facilitate the commerce of a port and the
net proceeds be used in harbor improvement, a State acts in subordination to the -power of Congress under the commerce clause.
P. 183.
4. Even though the State, in the conduct of its railroad, be said to
act in its "sovereign," distinguished from a 'private," capacity, its
sovereignty in that regard is necessarily diminished to the extent
of the power granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government. P. 183.
5. The principle by which state instrumentalities are protected from
federal taxation, and vice versa, is inapplicable by analogy as a
limitation upon the federal power to regulate interstate commerce.
P. 184.
6. The provisions of the Safety Appliance Act forbidding any common
carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to haul cars not
equipped with couplers as prespribed, and penalizing infractions,
include state-owned interstate rail carriers. P. 185.
7. The canon of construction that a sovereign is presumptively not
intended to be bound by its own statute unless named in it, should
not be extended so as to exempt from an Act of Congress a business
plainly within its terms and purpose, merely because the business
is carried on by a State. P. 186.
8. Congress may confer on inferior courts original jurisdiction of suits
in which a State is a party. P. 187.

297 U.S.

9. The inclusion of an earlier provision in the Judicial Code was not
a reenactment. P. 187.
10. Section 6 of the Safety Appliance Act, as amended in 1896, provides that any common carrier, for each car hauled by it in violation
of the Act, shall be liable to a penalty of $100, "to be recovered
in a suit or suits to be brought by the United States district attorney in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in
the locality where such violation shall have been committed." Section 233, Jud. Code, originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act
of 1789, gave this Court "exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies
of a civil nature where a State is a party," (with certain exceptions).
Assuming that a suit to recover the penalty is a controversy of a
civil nature, held that, with respect to such suits when brought
against States, § 6 supplants § 233, and lodges jurisdiction in the
district court of the locality. P. 187.

Argument for the United States.

The State is subject to the provisions of the Federal
Safety Appliance Act. United States v. Erie R. Co., 237
U. S. 402, 409; St. Louis & I. M. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, 210
U. S. 281, 294-296; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. United

34 I. C. C. Val. Rep. 276; United States v. New York
Central R. Co., 272 U. S. 457, 461-462.
The power of the Federal Government to regulate
state-owned railroads engaged in interstate commerce
would seem beyond doubt. Cf. Helvering v. Powers, 293
U. S. 214 (operation of a street railway); South Carolina
v. United States, 199 U. S. 437 (sale of liquor under a
dispensary system); Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360
(sale of liquor through state-owned stores); Georgia v.
Chattanooga, 264 U. S. 472, 481; United States v.
Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904; Bank of Kentucky v.
Wister, 2 Pet. 318, 323; Curranv. Arkansas, 15 How. 304,
308.
It is plain that a state-owned railroad would not be
immune from the federal taxing power. So far as the
commerce power is concerned it is not clear that any
immunity is properly to be implied in favor of the States;
but assuming that such immunity exists, it is manifestly
no more extensive than the immunity from federal taxation. Board of Trustees v. United States, 289 U. S. 48,
59; Southern Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 236 U. S.
439; Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry., 292 U. S. 57, 60-61.
Since the Federal Government clearly has the power
to regulate state-owned railroads engaged in interstate
commerce, no sound reason appears for excepting them
from the operation of existing federal statutes. The
Safety Appliance Act embraces any common carrier.

The historical basis for the rule that a sovereign is not
bound by a statute unless specifically named, clearly indicates that it has application only to the enacting
sovereign. There is no reason to assume that Congress
meant to distinguish between state and privately owned
railroads. See Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, 222
U. S. 20, 27; Mathewes v. Port Utilities Comm'n, 32 F.
(2d) 913.

270 U. S. 181, 195; cf. Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S.
313, 329; and Congress can vest jurisdiction of such cases
in the inferior federal courts. Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S.
449; United States v. Louisiana,123 U. S. 32.
The Constitutional principle is the same whether the
suit be brought with or without the consent of the State.
This is shown by Ames v. Kansas, supra, where the State
objected to having its suit removed. See also Bdrs v.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUsTlFc

STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a suit brought by the United States against the
State of California in the District Court for northern
California to recover the statutory penalty of $100 for
violation of the federal Safety Appliance Act, § 2, Act
of March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U. S. C. § 2,
and § 6 of the Act as amended April 1, 1896, 29 Stat.
85, 45 U. S. C., § 6.1
The complaint alleges that California, in the operation
of the state-owned State Belt Railroad, is a common carrier engaged in interstate transportation by railroad, and
that it has violated the Safety Appliance Act by hauling
over the road a car equipped with defective coupling
apparatus. Upon the trial, without a jury, upon stipulated facts, the district court gave judgment for the United
States. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, 75 F. (2d) 41, on the ground that as exclusive
jurisdiction of suits to which a state is a party is conferred upon this Court by § 233 of the Judicial Code, 36
Stat. 1156, 28 U. S. C. 341, the district court was without

I "Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged
in interstate commerce by railroad to haul or permit to be hauled
or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not
equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which
can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the
ends of the cars."
"Section 6. Any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce
by railroad using any locomotive engine, running any train, or hauling or permitting to be hauled or used on its line any car in vinlation
of any of the preceding provisions of this chapter, shall be liable to a
penalty of $100 for each and every such violation, to be recovered in
a suit or suits to be brought by the United States district attorney
in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction in the
locality where such violation shall have been committed; and it shall
be the duty of such district attorney to bring such suits upon duly
verified information being lodged with him of such violation having
occurred:

jurisdiction of the cause. We granted certiorari to review
the case as one involving questions of public importance,
upon a petition of the government which urged that the
state is a common carrier by railroad, subject to the Safety
Appliance Act, and, under its provisions, to suit in the
district court to recover penalties for violation of the
Act.
In an earlier suit, Slerman v. United States, 282 U. S.
25, brought against the Board of State Harbor Commissioners, which supervises operation of the State Belt Railroad, to recover penalties for violation of the Act, this
Court set aside the judgment of the district court for the
government because the state had not been made a party.
1. Whether a transportation agency is a common carrier depends not upon its corporate character or declared
purposes, but upon what it does. United States v. Brooklyn Terminal, 249 U. S.296, 304. The State Belt Railroad is owned and operated by the state, see Sherman v.
United States, supra. It parallels the water front of San
Francisco harbor and extends onto some forty-five stateowned wharves. It serves directly about one hundred
and seventy-five industrial plants, has track connection
with one interstate railroad, and, by wharf connections
with freight car ferries, links that and three other interstate rail carriers with freight yards in San Francisco
leased to them by the state. It receives and transports
from the one to the other, by its own engines, all freight
cars, loaded and empty, and the freight they contain, offered to it by railroads, steamship companies and industrial plants. The larger part of this traffic has its origin
or destination in states other than California. For the
transportation service it makes a flat charge per car. It
issues no bills of lading and is not a party tcj through
rates. It moves the cars on instructions contained in
"switch lists" made out by the delivering or receiving carrier, which pays the charge and absorbs it in its rate. The

charge on cars not delivered to or received from another
carrier is paid by the industry concerned.
The Belt Railroad is thus a terminal railroad for the
industries and carriers with which it connects, and it
serves as a link in the through transportation of interstate freight shipped to or from points in San Francisco
over the connecting carriers. Its service is of a public
character, for hire, and does not differ in any salient feature from that which this Court, in United States v.
Brooklyn Terminal, supra, 304, 305, held to be common
carriage by rail in interstate commerce within the meaning of the federal Hours of Service Act, 34 Stat. 1415, 45
TJ. S. C., § 61.
The state insists that the facts that it maintains no
freight station, issues no bills of lading, and is engaged
only in moving cars for a flat rate instead of at a charge
per hundred pounds of freight moved, distinguish the operation of its railroad from that of the Brooklyn Terminal. As the service involves transportation of the cars
and their contents, the method of fixing the charge is
unimportant. Belt Railway of Chicago v. United States,
168 Fed. 542, 544; see United States v. Union Stock Yard
& Transit Co., 226 U. S.286, 299, 300. And while maintenance of a freight station and the issue of bills of lading. may be embraced in the service of a cdmmon carrier,
and a part of interstate commerce, see United States v.
Ferger, 250 U. S. 199; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 193, they are not indispensable
adjuncts to either where the subject of transportation,
here cars loaded and empty, may be effected without.
All the essential elements of interstate rail transportation are present in the service rendered by the State
Belt Railroad. They are the receipt and transportation,
for the public, for hire, of cars moving in interstate
commerce. See United States v. Union Stock Yard &
Traneit Co., supra, 299; Union Stockyards Co. v. United

UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA.
175

Opinion of the Court.

States, 169 Fed. 404; Belt Railway of Chicago v. United
States, supra. Its service, involving as it does the transportation of all carload freight moving in interstate
commerce between the industries concerned and all railroad and steamship lines reaching the port, is of the same
character, though wider in scope, as that held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce in the
Brooklyn Terminal and the Union Stockyard cases. They
abundantly support the conclusion that such is the service rendered by the state in the present case, a conclusion
twice reached by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, see McCallum v. United States, 298 Fed. 373;
Tilden v. United States, 21 F. (2d) 967.
2. The state urges that it is not subject to the federal
Safety Appliance Act. It is not denied that the omission
charged would be a violation if by a privately-own6d rail
carrier in interstate commerce. But it is said that as
the state is operating the railroad without profit, for
the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and
is using the net proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, see Sherman v. United States, supra, Denning v.
State, 123 Cal. 316, it is engaged in performing a public
function in its sovereign capacity and for that reason
cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of
the federal Act. In any case it is argued that the statute
is not to be construed as applying to the state acting in
that capacity.
Despite reliance upon the point both by the government and the state, we think it unimportant to say
whether the state conducts its railroad in its "sovereign"
or in its "private" capacity. That in operating its railroad
it is acting within a power reserved to the states cannot be doubted. See Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v.
Seattle, 291 U. S. 619, 624; Green v. Frazier, 253 U. S.
233; Jones v. Portland,245 U. S. 217. The only question
we need consider is whether the exercise of that powr, in

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.

297 U.S.

whatever capacity, must be in subordination to the power
to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted
specifically to the national government. The sovereign
power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in
the Constitution. The power of a state to fix intrastate
railroad rates must yield to the power of the national government when their regulation is appropriate to the regulation of interstate commerce. United States v. Louisiana,
290 U, S. 70, 74, 75; Wisconsin Railroad Comm'n v.
Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563; Shreveport Rate
Cases, 234 U. S. 342. A contract between a state and a
rail carrier fixing intrastate rates is subject to regulation
and control by Congress' acting within the commerce
clause, New, York v. United States, 257 U. S. 591, as are
state agencies-created to efect a public purpose, see Sanitary District of Chicago v. United States, 266 U. S. 405;
Board of Trustees v. United States, 289 U. S. 48; see
Georgia v. Chattanooga,264 U. S. 472. In each case the
power of the State is subordinate to, the constitutional
power.
exercise of the granted federal
The analogy of the constitutional immunity of state
instrumentalities from federal taxation, on which respondent relies, is not illuminating. That immunity is implied
from the nature of our federal system and the relationship
within it of state and national governments, and is equally
a restriction on taxation by either of the instrumentalities
of the other. Its nature requires that it be so construed
as to allow to each government reasonable scope for
its taxing power, see Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269
U. S. 514, 522-524, which would be unduly curtailed if
either by extending its activities* could withdraw from
the taxing power of the other subjects of. taxation traditionally within it. Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214,
225; Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360; South" Carolina
v. United States, 199 U. S. 437; see Murray v. Wilson

UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIA.
175

Opinion of the Court.

Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 173, explaining South Carolina v. United States, supra. Hence we look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as
marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal
taxing power. But there is no such limitation upon the
plenary power to regulate commerce. The state can no
more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by
Congress than can an individual.
California, by-engaging in interstate commerce by rail,
has subjected itself to the commerce power, and is liable
for a violation of the Safety Appliance Act, as are other
carriers, unless the statute is to be deemed inapplicable
to state-owned railroads because it does not specifically
mention them. The federal Safety Appliance Act is remedial, to protect employees and the public from injury
because of defective railway appliances, Swinson v. Chicago, St. Paul, M. & 0. Ry. Co., 294 U. S.529; Fairport,
P. & E. R. Co., v. Meredith, 292 U. S.589, 594; Johnson
v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S. 1, 17, and to safeguard
interstate commerce itself from obstruction and injury due
to defective appliances upon locomotives and cars used on
the highways of interstate commerce, even though their
individual use is wholly intrastate. Southern Ry. Co. v.
UnitedStates,222 U. S.20; Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio
Ry. Co., 291 U. S. 205, 214. The danger to be apprehended is as great and commerce may be equally impeded
whether the defective appliance is used on a railroad
which is state-owned or privately-owned. No convincing
reason is advanced why interstate commerce and persons
and property con6erned in it should not receive the protection of the act whenever a state, as well as a privatelyowned carrier, brings itself within the sweep of the statute, or why its all-embracing language should not be
deemed to afford that protection.
In Ohio v. Helvering, supra, it was held that a state,
upon engaging in the business, became subject to a federal

statute imposing a tax on those dealing in intoxicating
liquors, although states were not specifically mentioned in
the statute. The. same conclusion was reached in South
Carolina v. United States, supra, and see Helvering v.
Powers, supra. Similarly the Interstate Commerce Commission has regarded this and other state-owned interstate
rail carriers as subject to its jurisdiction, although the
Interstate Commerce Act does not in terms apply to stateowned rail carriers. See California Canneries Co. v.
Southern Pacific Co., 51 I. C. C. 500, 502, 503; United
States v. Belt Line R. Co., 56 I. C. C. 121; Texas State
Rairoad, 34 I. C. C. Val. R. 276.
Respondent invokes the canon of construction that a
sovereign is presumptively not intended to be bound by
it's own statute unless named in it, see Guarantee Title &
Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty Co., 224 U. S. 152; United
States v. Herron,; 20 Wall. 251; In re Fowble, 213 Fed.
; 676. This rule has its historical basis in the English doctrine that the Crown is unaffected by acts of Parliament
not specifically directed against it. United States v.
Herron, supra, 255; Dollar Savings Bank v. United
States, 19 Wall. 227, 239. The presumption is an aid
to consistent construction of statutes of the enhcting
\sovereign when their purpose is in doubt, but it does not
require that the aim of a statute fairly to be inferred be
8isregarded because not explicitly stated. See Baltimore.
National Bank v. State Tax Commission of Maryland;
decided this day, post, p. 209. We can perceive no reason
for extending it so as to exempt a business carried on
by aistate from the otherwise applicable provisions of an
act of Congress, all-embracing in scope and national in
its purpose, which is as capable of being obstructed by
state as bk individual action. Language and objectives
s6 plain are not to be thwarted by resort to b,rule of
construction whose purpose is but to resolve doubts, and
whose application in the circumstances would be highly

artificial. It was disregarded in Ohio v. Helvering, supra,
and South Carolinav. United States, supra. See Heiner
v. Colonial Trust Co., 275 U. S. 232, 234, 235.
3. The jurisdiction of the district court to entertain
suits by the United States against a state under the
Safety Appliance Act turns on the construction to be
given to § 6 of the Act in the light of § 233 of the Judicial Code. Article III, § 2 of the Constitution extends
the judicial power of the United States and the-original
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to cases "in which a
state shall be a party." See United States v. West
Virginia, 295 U. S. 463, 470, and cases cited. But Congress may confer on inferior courts concurrent original
jurisdiction of such suits. Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S.
449, (United States v. Louisiana, 123 U. S. 32; compare
B6rs v. Preston, 111 U. S. 252. Section 233 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C., 341, originally enacted as § 13
of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 80, became § 687 of
the Revised Statutes, and was carried into the Judicial
Code in 1911, 36 Stat. 1156. It gives to this Court "exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature
where a state is a party, except between a state and its
citizens or between a state and citizens of other states
or aliens." The later enacted § 6 of the Safety Appliance
Act, see Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, provides that the
penalty which it imposes is "to be recovered in a suit or
suits to be brought ... in the district court of the United
States having jurisdiction in the locality where such
violation shall have been committed. .. ."
If it be assumed that the present suit to recover the
payment denominated a "penalty" by § 6 is a controversy of a civil nature, but see Wisconsin v. Pelican
Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265; cf. Milwaukee County
v. M. E. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, it is by § 233 of the
Judicial Code within the exclusive jurisdiction of this
Court, unless that provision is supplanted with respect

297 U. S.

to suits such as the present by the provisions of § 6. Upon that assumption § 6 is in conflict with § 233 of the
Judicial Code and supersedes it, United States v. Yuginovich, 256 U. S. 450, 463; United States ex rel. Chandler v. Dodge County Comm'rs, 110 U. S. 156; United
States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92, unless, again, the general
language of § 6 is to be taken as not applying to suits
brought against a state. Since the section which, as we
have held, imposes the liability upon state- and privatelyowned carriers alike, also provides the remedy and designates the manner and the court in which the remedy is
to be pursued, we think the jurisdictional provisions are
as applicable to suits brought to enforce the liability of
states as to those against privately-6wned carriers, and
that the district court had jurisdiction.
If we lay aside possible doubts, whether the suit is of
a "civil nature," in which case only does § 233 of the
Judicial Code purport to make the jurisdiction of this
Court exclusive, still, in construing the jurisdictional
provisions of § 6 of the Safety Appliance Act practical
convenience and "the tacit assumptions" upon which it
is reasonable to suppose its language was used, see Ohio
ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379, 383, are not to be
disregarded. The controversy in a suit authorized by § 6
is essentially local in character and involves issues for
which a jury trial may be appropriate, compare Georgia
v. Brailsford,3 Dall. 1. Their adjudication often requires
the presence, as witnesses, of railroad workers, shippers
and otfhers of the locality. These are considerations
which undoubtedly led to the command that the suit
should be brought in the district court of the "locality"
where violations occur. They are considerations as applicable to suits against a state as to suits against a privately-owned railroad. The suggestion that it should be
assumed that Congress did not intend to subject a sovereign state to the inconvenience and loss of dignity in-

TREIGLE v. ACME HOMESTEAD ASSOCIATION.*
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA.

No. 287.

Argued January 9, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.

Prior to the adoption of Act No. 140 of 1932 by the legislature of
Louisiana, building and loan associations in that State were required, whenever the income ordinarily applicable to the demands
of withdrawing members was insufficient to pay all such demands
within sixty days from date of notice, to set apart fifty per cent.
of the receipts of the association to pay such withdrawing members,
and payments were to be made in the order of i.resentation of
notices of withdrawal. Act No. 140 abolished this requirement,
and the amount to be allocated to payment of withdrawing members
was by that Act left to the sole discretion of the directors, who
were authorized to apply the association's receipts to the making of
loans, to payment of old or new debts, to dividends to continuing
members, or to the creation of a cash reserve for future dividends.
A stockholder who, prior to the adoption of the Act, gave notice of
withdrawal, but whose demand had not been paid, although similar applications had been paid, challenged the validity of the Act
under the Federal Constitution. Held:
1. The Act impairs the obligation of the stockholder's contract
and destroys his vested rights in violation of § 10 of Article I, and
§ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution.
