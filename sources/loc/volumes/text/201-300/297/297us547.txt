to have ascertained and established a part of the boundary
between them. March 1, 1926, we announced our decision. 270 U. S. 295. To carry it into effect, the States

297 U.S.

upon the agreement and consent of the parties entered
the decree proposed. 272 U. S. 398.
November 7, 1932, Wisconsin brought this suit against
Michigan, alleging that as a result of mistakes of the
parties the decree of November 22, 1926, did not carry
our decision into effect as to the tracts called "Grassy
Island" and "Sugar Island" on the north bank and a
short distance from the mouth of the Menominee River
and as to the Green bay section of the boundary. Issue
was joined, and a special master took evidence, heard
counsel for the States, made findings of fact, stated his
conclusions of law and recommended a form of decree.
The parties filed exceptions to his report and, after hearing counsel, the court May 20, 1935, decided (295 U. S.
455, 462):
"The decree to be entered in this case will establish the
boundary through and along, or near, the middle of the
waters of Green bay that are here involved. That line
commences at a point midway between the piers at the
harbor entrance of the Menominee River; thence east by
south seven and one-eighth miles; thence approximately
north by east one-eighth east, about eight and seveneighths miles; thence to and along a line in or near
the middle of the bay to a point west of the Rock Island
passage; thence easterly by courses and distances to be
designated through that passage to the boundary in the
middle of Lake Michigan. The decree will appropriately
define the tracts called 'Grassy -Island' and 'Sugar Island'
and declare them to belong to Michigan."
And the court ordered (p. 463):
"The case is referred to the special master, and he is
directed to prepare and submit to the court a form of decree which will give effect to this decision. Inasmuch as
the preparation of the decree may involve the ascertainment of physical facts and the formulation of technical
descriptions, the master is authorized to hear counsel, take
evidence and procure such "assistance, if any, as may be

necessary to enable him conveniently and promptly to
discharge the duties here imposed upon him. He may
call upon counsel to propose forms of decree. He is directed to give them opportunity to submit objections to
the form prepared by him and to include the objections,
if any, in his report."
The master took evidence, viewed the locus, heard
counsel and in accordance with the court's directions filed
his report. It includes a form of decree. Wisconsin objects to the proposed decree in respect of the part of the
boundary in Green bay, Rock Island passage and Lake
Michigan not defined by our decision of May 20, 1935,
and submits for consideration alternative forms of decree.
Michigan urges adoption of that proposed by the master.
After hearing counsel for the respective States, the
court does hereby order, adjudge and decree:
1. Wisconsin's objections are overruled. The definitions of the boundary recommended by the master are
approved and adopted.
2. The decree of this court, entered November 22, 1926,
in the suit brought by Michigan against Wisconsin, is
modified by striking therefrom the provisions that purport to definie the parts of the boundary in the Menominee River downstream from the concrete bridge on United
States Highway No. 41 between the cities of Menominee,
Michigan, and Marinette, Wisconsin, and in the waters
of Green bay, the Rock Island passage and Lake Michigan and by inserting in lieu of the parts of the decree so
stricken out, definitions of the boundary recommended by
the master.
3. The decree in Michigan v. Wisconsin, as modified by
this decree, defines and establishes the boundary between
these States. As modified, it is as follows:
It is ordered, adjudged and decreed:
That the boundary between the States of Michigan and
Wisconsin along the- following course be and it is hereby
fixed and finally established as follows:
