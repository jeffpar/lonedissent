TYSON v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 192.

Argued January 7, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.

1. Section 19 of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, as amended,
bars suits on yearly renewable term insurance unless brought within
six years after the right accrued or within one year after the date
of approval (July 3, 1930) of the amending Act, but suspends the
limitation "for the period elapsing between the filing in the bureau
of the claim sued upon and the denial of said claim by the director."
Held, where a claim was filed July 3, 1931 and notice of denial was
received by claimant through the mail on November 16, 1932,
suspension of the limitation ended not later than the latter date
and a suit brought on November 17, 1932, alleging disability existing from time of discharge in 1918, was barred. P. 122.
2. Whether denial of the claim occurred prior to the date when notice
was received by the claimant, not decided. P. 123.
76 F. (2d) 533, affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

kept in force by premium payments while the insured remained in service. The petition, filed November 17,
1932, alleged that disability had existed ever since the
claimant's discharge from the Ariy, December 18,
1918.
The trial court dismissed the cause for want of jurisdiction, being of opinion that it was not instituted within the prescribed time. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgment.
July 3, 1931, Tyson filed his claim with the Veterans'
Administration. November 16, 1932, he received from it
a letter, dated November 12, 1932 and mailed at Washington November 14, 1932, which stated that this had
been denied. Also-"You may consider such denial final
for the purposes of instituting suit under Section 19 of
the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, as amended. If you
accept the denial of the claim by the Council as final, the
suspension of the statute of limitations provided by Section 19 shall cease from and after the date of this letter
plus the number of days usually required by the Post
Office Department for the transmission of regular mail
from Washington, D. C., to your last address of
record."
The question for decision is whether the petitioner
brought suit within the time permitted by ยง 19, Act of
1924, as amended. ยง 445, t~tle 38, United States Code;
c. 849, ยง 4, 46 Stat. 992, approved July 3, 1930.
"No suit on yearly renewable term insurance shall be
allowed under this section unless the same shall have been
brought within six years after the right accrued for which
the claim is made or within one year after the date of approval of this amendatory Act, whichever is the later
date, , . . : Provided, That for the purposes of this section it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the.
happening of the contingency on which the claim is
founded: Provided further, That this limitation is sus-

pended for the period elapsing between the filing in the
bureau of the claim sued upon and the denial of said
claim by the director."
Manifestly, suit was not begun within six years after
the right accrued, or within one year after July 3, 1930.
Permission to sue had expired unless the limitation was
suspended between the filing on July 3, 1931 and November 17, 1932, when proceedings began in the trial court.
Whether the denial occurred November 12th, the date
given the letter of advice, or November 14th, when this
was mailed, or November 16th, when the claimant actually received it, although much debated by counsel, we
need not consider.
The statute provides: No suit . . . shall be allowed
. . . unless . . . brought within six years after the right
accrued . . . or within one year after July 3, 1930, whichever is the later date. But this limitation was suspended
by the proviso for the period between the filing and denial
of the claim.
In any view, the denial occurred not later than November 16th, 1932. And, with that day, the suspension of
the statute ended-certainly the period between July 3,
1931 and November 16, 1932 did not extend beyond the
latter day. The plain words employed by Congress require this conclusion. Suit was not begun until the 17th,
and that was too late.
Affirmed.
