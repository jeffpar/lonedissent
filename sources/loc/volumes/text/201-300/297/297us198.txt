THE PRUDENCE CO., INC. v. FIDELITY & DEPOSIT COMPANY OF MARY-LAND ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS- FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 270. Argued January 8, 9, 1936.-Decided February 3, 1936.
1. In an action by the maker of a building loan, secured by a mortgage on the building, to recover on a bond indemnifying him from
loss due to the failure of the borrower to complete the building in
time and manner as specified in the loan contract, the measure of
damages should be such as will place the lender in the same position
.as if the building had been completed as stipulated. P. 205.
2. Where the lender, in such a case, was obliged by the borrower's
defaults in construction of an apartment building, to foreclose his
mortgage, buy in the unfinished structure for less than the loan
and take a deficiency judgment, it was error to limit recovery on
the indemnity bond to the cost of completing the building in accordance with the contract; in the estimation of damages there
should be considered also the rents that might have been impounded in the foreclosure proceedings had the building been ready
for use, and the reduced value of the building at the foreclosure sale
because of its unfinished state. P. 206.
3. The difference between the value of the unfinished building, at the
foreclosure sale, and the value it would have had if completed as per
contract, may be considered as made up of two elements, the cost
of completion and the carrying charges meanwhile. These may

be proved by expert testimony; or where, as in this case, the
building was completed by the lender, the actual cost of that may
be shown; and the other element may be established by expert
proof of the rental value of such a building (finished) at the date
of default and later. P. 206,
4. In this case, in proof of damages due to delay in completing the
building, evidence was received, without objection, of payments for
taxes and insurance and of loss of interest on investment during
the time required for its completion. Held that an objection that
such carrying charges may have exceeded the rents that might
have been received if the building had been finished as agreed, came
too late, it not having been made at the trial. P. 207.
5. In an action for damages caused by impairment of a mortgage
security, through the borrower's failure to complete the mortgaged
building as agreed, 16ss of rents is to be classed not as special but
as general damage and may be proved without having been specifically alleged. P. 207.

The holder of a mortgage, representing a money interest
in land, is entitled to the ifiterest, 'corresponding to the
rent of an owner, which he loses, during the delay in completion of a building guaranteed to be finished at a specified time.
Ihterest is recognized as part of the measure of damages
for breach of contract, where loss of such interest was
within the contemplation of the parties. United States v.

In addition to being within the contemplation of the
parties, interest, taxes and insurance premiums are recoverable because necessarily included in the general
rules of. damages applicable to bonds guaranteeing completion.
If the building had been completed and ready for
occupancy with all equipment installed, on December
16, 1930, Prudence Company could have immediately
rented it instead of having to wait until October 1, 1931;
and out of such rent it would have had a source of payment of its interest, taxes and insurance premiums.
The fact that a breach of the obligation to pay the
mortgage is also involved does not alter the causal relation between the delay in completion of the building and

Co., 195 App. Div. 756, 760, aff'd 233 N. Y. 602.
Whether the rule of damages be considered from the
standpoint of difference in value, cost of completion, or
impairment of security, the broad primary rule of putting Prudence Company in as good position as it would
have been had the building been properly completed and
within the time specified, requires allowance of its actual
loss in interest, taxes and insurance premiums.
Interest, -taxes and insurance premiums during the
period of completion must necessarily enter into the determination of difference in value.
Taxes, insurance premiums, and interest on the investment during the construction period are uniformly
treated for accounting, rate-making and general legal
purposes, as part of the cost of construction, and must be
included in the entire cost of the erection, construction
and completion of the building which the sureties agreed
to pay.
The provisions of the surety bond in this case obliged
the surety in express terms to pay interest on the loan,
and taxes and insurance on the mortgaged property
until the date of actual completion of the building in
accordance with the plans and specifications.
Mr. John W. Davis, with whom Messrs. Thomas E.
White and Joseph F. Murray were on the brief, for respondents.
The measure of damages is the difference between the
value of the uncompleted building on the date of the default and its value if it had been completed. Trainor Co.

Under the decisions in Kidd v. McCormick and .Trainor
v. Aetna Casualty Co., petitioner is not entitled to recover
loss of interest on the mortgage loan, taxes or insurance
premiums.
The petitioner included in its claimed cost of completion, taxes and insurance premiums covering the period
alleged to have been used for completion, but which were
due and were paid after petitioner had purchased the
property on the foreclosure sale.
It also claimed specifically for interest on the mortgage loan claimed to have been lost during the alleged
period used for completion.
In neither Kidd v. McCormick nor Trainor v. Aetna
Casualty Co. did the court allow interest on mortgages,
taxes or insurance premiums. In each case it was held
that the proper measure of damages was difference in
value.
Respondents' bond did not guarantee payment of interest, taxes and insurance premiums, but only guaranteed the completion of a building. Cf. United Real Estate Co. v. McDonald, 140 Mo. 605; Province Securities

App. Div. 152; Hamilton v. Van Rensselaer, 43 N. Y. 244;
Melick v. Knox, 44 N. Y. 676.
No evidence was offered by petitioner to show that it
suffered any loss of interest on mortgage loan, or taxes
or insurance premiums, by reason of failure to complete
the building.
Since petitioner concedes that it is entitled to recover
damages suffered by it only as mortgagee and not as
owner, it may not recover interest on mortgage, taxes or
insurance premiums, because the foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the property terminated its status
as mortgagee.
The difference in value between a building with and
without omissions and substitutions is the proper measure of damages for such omissions and substitutions and
the petitioner offered no evidence that the value of the
building was lessened by reason thereof.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO

delivered the opinion of the

dourt.
We are to determine the measure of damages upon a
bond conditioned against loss through the failure to complete a building at the time and in the manner called for
by the building contract.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

297 U.S.

In September, 1929, petitioner, the Prudence Company, Inc., undertook to make a mortgage loan of $6,650,000 in aid of the construction of Essex House, an
apartment hotel in the City of New York. The borrower
covenanted that the building would conform to plans and
specifications, and would be completed not later than
December 16, 1930. As part of the same transaction, two
surety companies, the respondents in this court, signed
a bond in the sum of $3,000,000, indemnifying the lender
against loss through the failure of the borrower to construct and pay for a building conforming to the contract,
and complete it by the stated time. The bond also provided that in the event of the borrower's default, the
lender, if it so elected, should be at liberty to go forward
with the work, and charge the cost against the sureties.
Other conditions are believed to be immaterial to any
question now before us.
On December 16, 1930, the borrower made default
under the mortgage, abandoning the work with the building then unfinished. At that time the petitioner's advances under the building loan agreement were $6.,575,000, the full amount promised, less $75,000 retained by
agreement. On December 18, 1930, petitioner through
its nominee brought suit in the state court for the foreclosure of the mortgage. On January 6, 1931, it went
into possession with the mortgagor's consent. On January 19, 1931, there was a judgment of foreclosure, followed by a sale on March 17, 1931, at which the mortgagee was the buyer, the bid of $6,000,000 being applied
upon the mortgage. A deficiency judgment of $716,215.02
was entered the next month.
Petitioner in possession of the building went on with
the unfilished work, bringing it to completion in October,
1931. An action on the bond was then begun against the
sureties. The trial court gave judgment for damages in
the sum of $798,416.81, made up of three classes of items:

PRUDENCE CO. v. FIDELITY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

the cost of completion; the loss from omissions and inferior substitutions; and the interest on investment, together with taxes and insurance charges, while the building was idle because unready for its occupants. 7 F.
Supp. 392. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit found this award to be excessive. In the view of
that court no award should have been made for interest,
taxes or insurance during the period of idleness. Payments necessary to complete the building were properly
allowed, for they were evidence of the difference in value
between an incomplete and a completed structure. Reparation was also to be made for omissions and substitutions to the extent that they diminished value, unless
strict compliance had been waived by the lender or its
agents. However, the extent of the recovery was not
susceptible of ascertainment without the aid of a new trial.
This was so because evidence of waiver had been offered
by the surety and erroneously excluded. A remand was
thus necessary to elicit all the facts. 77 F. (2d) 834.
Before a second trial was had, a writ of certiorari issued
at the instance of petitioner to. resolve a claim of conflict
between the decision to be reviewed and a decision of this
court. Trainor Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 290
U. S. 47. The writ states that it is "limited to the question of the measure of damages," thus excluding from our
consideration the ruling of the court below as to the effect
of waiver of performance.
Limiting our review accordingly, we think the extent of
the recovery upon the new trial that will be necessary has
been too narrowly confined.
The petitioner should be placed in the same position it
would have occupied if the building had been completed
on December 16, 1930. Trainor Co. v. Aetna Casualty &
Surety Co., supra, at pp. 54, 55; Kidd v. McCormick, 83
N. Y. 391, 398; Province Securities Corp. v. Maryland
Casualty Co., 269 Mass. 75, 94; 168 N. E. 252. To give

it nothing but the cost of doing the unfinished work, plus
the loss resulting from omissions and substitutions, would
be a scant measure of reparation, allowing nothing for
delay. Ruff v. Rinaldo, 55 N. Y. 664; C. W. Hunt Co.
v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 199 Mass. 220, 233, 235; 85
N. E. 446; Sedgwick, Damages, 9th ed., ยง 645. If performance had been prompt, the mortgagee would have
had the security of a finished structure, which a buyer at
a foreclosure sale could have utilized at once. During the
pendency of the suit, the rents might have been impounded at the hands of a receiver and applied upon the
deficiency resulting from the sale. Freedman'sSaving &
Trust Co. v. Shepherd, 127 U. S. 494, 503; Worthen Co.
v. Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56, 62. With the building still
unfinished there were no rents to be collected and hence
none to be applied in reduction of the debt. More important still, the amount of any bid was certain to be
reduced by notice to the bidders that the building would
be unproductive until ready to be occupied. From the
point of view of bidders the reduction in value as the
consequence of delay would be made up of two factors:
the estimated cost of finishing the work, and the estimated carrying charges, not to exceed the rental value,
during the period of idleness. Cf. Trainor Co. v. Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., supra, at p. 55; Kidd v. McCormick, supra, at p. 398. So at least an assessor of the
damages might find as a fair inference of fact, even if
the finding does not follow as an inference of law. The
effect of the decision is to hold down the recovery to the
first of these factors and to eliminate the second.
The petitioner might have relied upon the testimony
of --.perts as to the total depreciation and as to the
weight of the component factors. It chose a different
method. To show the loss sustained from finishing the
work, it proved the actual cost, as by the express provisions of the bond it was at liberty to do. Cf. Comey v.

PRUDENCE CO. v. FIDELITY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

United Surety Co., 217 N. Y. 268, 276; 111-N. E. 832;
Appleton v. Marx, 191 N. Y. 81, 85, 86; 86 N. E. 563.

One of the factors of diminished value it has thus established with precision. To fix the weight of the other
factor, it would have done better to give evidence by experts of the rental value of such a building at the date of
the default and later. Griffin v. Colver, 16 N. Y. 489,
496; Cassidy v. Le Fevre, 45 N. Y. 562, 567; Witherbee
v. Meyer, 155 N. Y. 446, 453, 454; 50 N. E. 58: Instead
of doing this it chose to give evidence of the taxes, insurance premiums and interest on investment. We are told
by the respondents now that for anything appearing in
the record the carrying charges may have been greater
than any rents that could have been earned if the building had been finished. No such objection was made upon
the trial. We think it comes too late when first made
upon appeal. In the absence of more specific challenge
the trier of the facts might not improperly assume that
interest on the investment along with taxes and insurance were losses flowing from the failure to receive a
finished building. New York & Colorado Mining Syndi\cate v. Fraser,130 U. S. 611, 622, 623. The point will
not be labored, for the assumption is a safe one that
evidence and objection will not be subject to this criticism when the case is tried again.
A question is raised as to the form of the complaint.
The respondents insist that its allegations are insufficient
to permit proof of loss of rents in addition to the cost.
We read the pleading otherwise. In the circumstances of
this case, loss of rents is to be reckoned as general, not
special, damage. Sedgwick, Damages, 9th ed., ยง 1261;
Griffin v. Colver, supra; Cassidy v. Le Fevre, supra;
Ruff v. Rinaldo, supra; Jutte v. Hughes, 67 N. Y. 267,
271. It is one of the factors contributing to and measuring the diminished worth of the security. Damages when
general are recoverable under a pleading that does not

enumerate the items. Armstrong v. Percy, 5 Wend. 535,
538, 539; Laraway v. Perkins, 10 N. Y. 371, 373. Here
the complaint alleges that except for the default and in
particular the delay, the plaintiff would have obtained
upon foreclosure the full amount of principal and interest due upon the mortgage; it alleges that through the
same causes the value of the mortgage was impaired to
the extent of the deficiency judgment; it alleges that the
plaintiff has thereby been deprived of any and all return
on the amount of the investment. We find these allegations broad enough to let in evidence of damages along
the lines that have been marked.
Another trial will permit the petitioner to show more
accurately than it has done upon the record now before
us that the building was continuously untenantable until
the completion of the work and that the time taken for
completion did not outrun the bounds of reason.
What was ruled by the Court of Appeals in respect of
the scope of the recovery for omissions and substitutions
was not specified as error in the petition for the writ, and
will be assumed to be correct. Zellerbach Paper Co. v.
Helvering, 293 U. S. 172, 182; Helvering v. Taylor, 293
U. S. 507, 511; Clark v. Williard, 294 U. S. 211, 216.
The judgment is modified by a direction that the measure of damages upon a new trial shall be that defined in
this opinion, and as thus modified affirmed.
Modified and affirmed.
