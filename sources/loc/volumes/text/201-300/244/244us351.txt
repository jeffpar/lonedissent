CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE & ST. PAUL RAILWAY
COMPANY OF IDAHO v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEAL"OR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 176. Argued April 18, 19, 1917.-Decided June 4,1917.
The power to establish forest reservations, bestowed upon the President
by acts of Congress, includes the power to withdraw lands temporarily from disposition under the public land laws in order that they
may be examined, and, if found suitable, may be permanently reserved as forests.
An act of the Secretary of the Interior in directing the making of
a temporary withdrawal for forest reserve purposes is in legal contemplation the act of the President.
Lands reserved for forest purposes, whether by temporary withdrawal
or permanent reservation, are "specially reserved from sale" within
the meaning of ยง 5 of the general railroad right of way act of March 3,
1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482, and also, like the military, park and
Indian reservations therein mentioned, are set apart for a public
purpose, and are not subject to the provisions of that act.
Under the provision relating to the subject in the Act of March 3, 1899,
c. 427, 30 Stat. 1233, a railroad right of way may be obtained over
a temporary or permanent forest reservation only if in the judgment
of the Secretary of the Interior the public interests will not be injuriously affected thereby, and, in exercising his broad discretion
under this provision, the Secretary may condition his approval of an
application upon the prior filing of a stipulation, binding upon the
applicant, respecting the use and enjoyment of the privilege granted,
the prevention of forest fires, and compensation for timber cut or
destroyed or for other injuries done to the reservation.
'Where, for the purpose of securing a right of way under the Act of 1899,
supra, with immediate permission to proceed with construction
work, a railroad company's agent' agreed in writing that it would
later execute and abide by a stipulation touching its rights and conduct in the reservation, but the agreement was made subject to
ratification by the company, Held, that the company's action in
availing itself of the permission and proceeding with the construction work with knowledge of the manner in which the permission

had been obtained, and its acceptance of ensuing benefits, amounted
to an implied ratification of its agent's agreement, binding the company either to execute the required stipulation or to discontinue the
construction and operation of its railroad within the reservation.
A suit by the United States to enjoin a railroad company from constructirg)and operating its road through a national forest in default
of the execution and filing by it of a stipulation required by the
Secretary of the Interior, and to obtain damages for timber cut and
destroyed and for injury done in the course of the construction and
operation of such railroad, is cognizable in equity, and a bill praying
such relief is not multifarious.
The damages assessed against the appellant in this case are in part
justified by the terms of the stipulation which it agreed to execute,
and in other respects are sustained by the concurring decisions 61
the courts below.
In the absence of either cross-appeal by the Government or objection
by the appellant company, the court will not decide whether the
decree, instead of commanding unconditionally that the company
execute the stipulation agreed upon, should not have provided, in
the alternative, for ousting the company from the reservation if it
did not execute such stipulation within a certain time.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a suit by the United States to enjoin a railroad
company from constructing or operating its railroad
through a national forest reserve in Idaho unless it executes and files with the Secretary of the Interior a stipula-

tion required by that officer, and to obtain damages for

timber cut and destroyed and injury done in the course

of the construction and operation of such railroad. In
the District Court, 207 Fed. Rep. 164, and in the Circuit
Court of Appeals, 218 Fed. Rep. 288, the Government
prevailed. The railroad company prosecutes this appeal.
The forest reserve had its inception in an order by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office, made March 21,
1905, temporarily withdrawing a large body of public
lands from all disposal, save under the mineral land laws.
The order was made by direction of the Secretary of the
Interior with a view to the creation of a permanent forest
reserve, under ยง 24 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26
Stat. 1095,. if after further examination that should receive the President's approval. The permanent reserve
was created November 6, 1906, by a proclamation of the
President. Between the temporary withdrawal and the
President's proclamation the railroad company was incorporated under the laws of Idaho and filed with the
Secretary of the Interior a copy of its articles of incorporation and due proofs of its organization. During the
same period it also filed in the local land office a map or
profile of its proposed railroad through the reserve, and
after the President's proclamation it filed in that office a
second and then a third map. The line of the proposed
road shown upon the second map differed widely from
that U4on the first and the line shown upon the third
differed materially from those upon the others. The first
and second maps, neither of which had been approved,
were returned to the company as superseded by the third.
It was filed May 10, 1907. At that time, as also before
any map was filed, the regulations governing applications
for railroad rights of way in forest reserves required the
applicant to enter into a stipulation respecting the use
and enjoyment of the privilege, the prevention of forest
fires, the compensation to be made for timber cut or
destroyed and the duty of the company to pay for any
injury otherwise done to the reserve. 32 L. D. 481; 34

L. D. 583. One provision in the regulations said: "No
construction can be allowed on a reservation until an
application for right of way has been regularly filed in
accordance with the laws of the United States and has
been approved by the Department, or has been considered
by this office or the Department, and permission for such
construction has been specifically given." After filing the
third map the company sought permission from the Forest
Office to proceed with the construction of its railroad in
advance of the approval of its map, and to that end its
authorized representative, Mr. George R. Peck, in its
behalf, signed and filed in the Forest Office the following
memorandum:
"Whereas, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway
Company of Idaho desires immediate permission from
the Forest Service to begin construction of the company's
railroad in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, Idaho, I
hereby promise and agree on behalf of the company that
it will execute and abide by stipulations and conditions
to be prescribed by the Forester in respect to said railroad;
such stipulation and conditions to be as nearly as practicable like those executed by the company on January 18,
190, in respect to its railroad within the Helena National
Forest, Montana."
The Forester wrote upon the memorandum, and;igned,
an endorsement, saying: "Approved and advance permission given to construct, subject to ratification hereof by the
company." At the same time a telegram was sent to the
supervisor of the reserve, saying: "Advance permission
given today St. Paul Railroad Company to construct railroad through Coeur d'Alene, subject usual stipulations.
Supervise clearing and piling and scale all timber cut."
There was no express ratification of the Peck memorandum, but shortly after it was made the company entered
upon the reserve and actively proceeded with the construction of its road, which it would not have been per-

Opinion of the Court.

mitted to do without the memorandum. Not until the
work had proceeded for some months was there any indication that the memorandum- was not satisfactory to the
company. It then declined to execute the stipulation
called for by the memorandum and assigned as a reason
that Mr. Peck had acted upon the mistaken belief that
the President's proclamation creating the permanent
reserve preceded the filing of the first map, when in fact
the map was filed before the proclamation was issued,
and that the execution of such a stipulation as was called
for by the memorandum was indispensable, when, as
the company asserted, it was entitled, under the Act of
March 3, 1875, infra, to a right of way through the reserve
without entering into any stipulation or assenting to any
conditions. But the officers of the Forest Service insisted,
with the full sanction of the Secretary of the Interior and*
of the Secretary of Agriculture, that the stipulation be
executed and that without it the company was not entitled to proceed. This resulted in a conference at which
the company particularly requested that its construction
work be not disturbed and assented to an arrangement
for further negotiations or, if need be, a "friendly lawsuit." Further negotiations failed and the present suit
followed. When it was begun the road through the reserve was nearly completed and was in operation, the
construction being on the line shown on the third map.
Approval had not been given to this map but had been
withheld awaiting the company's execution of the prescribed stipulation.
The District Court, after concluding and announcing
that the company was bound by the Peck memorandum
and that the Government was entitled to a decree, gave
the parties an opportunity to agree upon the form of
stipulation called for by that memorandum and then
postponed the assessment of damages as a matter which
might be affected materially by the terms of the stipula-

tion. Afterward the parties brought into court a form of
stipulation, which they agreed was what was required by
the Peck memorandum, and that form was adopted by
the court, with the addition only of a paragraph declaring
that the stipulation should be deemed to have been
executed as of May 10, 1907, which was the date of the
Peck memorandum, of the permission to proceed with the
construction and of the filing of the map according to
which the road was constructed.
Rights of way for railroads over lands of the United
States were granted only by special acts until March 3,
1875, when Congress enacted a general law upon the subject and confided its administration to the Land Department. Chap. 152, 18 Stat. 482. But that'law, by its
fifth section, was declared to be inapplicable to "any
military, park, or Indian reservation, or other lands
specially reserved from sale." Lands in a forest reserve
not only are specially reserved from sale, but, like those
in the reservations particularly named, are set apart for
a public purpose. Act June 4, 1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 34-36.
That they come Within the excepting provision of the
fifth section, as do lands in other public reservations,
is plain. Both Congress and the Land Department have
so regarded them. House Report No. 1212, 54th Cong.,
1st sess.; House Report No. 1790, 55th Cong., 3rd sess.;
Brainard and Northern Minnesota Ry. Co., 29 L. D. 257.
Thus the company neither did nor could acquire a right
of way over these lands under the law of 1875. And this
is true notwithstanding the prelitoinary steps taken, as
before recited, in advance of the creation of the permanent reserve. The temporary withdrawal was made
several months before any of those steps were takenindeed, before the company came into existence-and
remained in force until the permanent reserve was created.
While the withdrawal was in force it was as much of an
obstacle to the acquisition of a railroad right of way over

CHICAGO, MIL. & ST. P. RY. v. UNITED STATES. 357
244 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

these lands as was the permanent reserve thereafter. The
power to establish the reserve included the power to make
the temporary withdrawal, and the act of the Secretary
of the Interior in directing the latter was in legal. contemplation the act of the President. United States v.
Morrison, 240 U. S. 192, 212; Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet.
498, 512-513; Wolsey v. Chapman, 101 U. S. 755, 769-770.
We come then to the provision in the Appropriation Act
of March 3, 1899, c. 427, 30 Stat. 1233, which says:
"That in the form provided by existing law the Secretary of the Interior may file and approve surveys and
plats of any right of way for a wagon road, railroad, or
other highway over and across any forest reservation or
reservoir site when in his judgment the public interests
will not be injuriously affected thereby."
Doubtless if this provision were separately considered,
its purpose would seem obscure, but it must be considered
in connection with the law of 1875 and the rulings thereunder, and when this is done its purpose seems reasonably
plain. That law, by its first section, provides in general
terms for rights of way for railroads over public lands.
By its fourth section it deals with the identification of the
desired right of way by a survey and plat and provides
for filing the plat and securing its approval by the
Secretary of the Interior. By its fifth section, as has been
seen, it excepts forest and other reservations from its
operation. Because of this exception the Secretary of the
Interior was ruling-properly so, as we think-that his
-authority did not extend to receiving and approving surveys and plats of rights of way in forest reserves. And
so, to obtain such a right of way it was necessary to go
to Congress. The requests for special acts came to be
frequent, especially as the reserves were increasing in
number. In this situation Congress passed the provision
last quoted. It is a general and continuing provision,
and says, in substance, that rights of way for railroads

through forest reserves may be secured when, and only
when, the public interests will not be injuriously affected,
and it commits the solution of that question to the Secretary of the Interior. If "in his judgment" the public
interests will not be jeopardized, he "may file and approve" surveys and plats of any such right of way. In
short, he is invested with a large measure of discretion to
be exercised for the conservation of the public interests,
and only through his approval can the right of way be
acquired Without further action by Congress.
Here the Secretary made it manifest, through the regulations before noticed and otherwise, that in his judgment due regard for the public interests required that a
stipulation, such as was described in the Peck memorandum, be exacted of the company as a condition to the
approval of the survey and map, that is, to securing the
right of way. Rightly understanding that this was so,
Mr. Peck, the company's representative, promised on its
behalf that it would comply with that condition. The
promise was given for the purpose of securing permission
to proceed at once With the construction of the road, and
on the faith of the promise the permission was given.
While this was said to be subject to the company's ratification, it must be held upon this record that there was an
implied ratification. The company promptly availed
itself of the permission and proceeded with the work of
construction. The circumstances were such that it must
have known how the permission was obtained. It was
largely benefited thereby and to these benefits it ever
since has held fast. True, after some months had elapsed,
it manifested a purpose to disaffirm Mr. Peck's promise,
but that was after the implied ratification and after the
construction had proceeded so far that restoration of the
original situation was not possible.
It follows that the company not only is bound by the
Peck memorandum but is in a position where it must

Opinion of the Court.

execute the required stipulation or discontinue the construction and operation of its railroad in the reserve.
It is objected that the case is not one which is cognizable
in a court of equity and that the bill is multifarious. Both
branches of the objection are without merit, so plainly
so that a discussion of them would serve no purpose.
The assessment of the damages is called in question,
but without any good reason. The stipulation agreed
upon as conforming to the Peck memorandum was rightly
regarded as decisive of several of the questions bearing
upon the assessment and no reason is perceived for disturbing the concurring decisions below upon the others.
The decree unconditionally commands the execution
and filing of the prescribed stipulation without awarding
an alternative injunction, and counsel for the Government
suggest that it should have enjoined the company from
the further occupation of the reserve unless within a
prescribed time the stipulation be executed and filed.
The criticism is not without merit and doubtless is
prompted by a careful study of the bill. But as the Government has not appealed and the company is not complaining of. the failure to put the matter in the alternative,
the point may be passed without further notice.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
