erly regarded as but part of a railroad's extension or equipment as
understood and applied in common practice.
Under Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution, extending the judicial power
of the United States "to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," and Art. I, § 8, conferring on Congress power to make all
laws which may be necessary and proper for executing the powers
vested in the general government or in any of its departments or
officers, Congress has paramount power to fix and determine the
maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country.
In the absence of controlling statutes, the general maritime law as
accepted by the federal courts constitutes part of our national law
applicable to matters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
The power of the States to change, modify or affect the general maritime law, while existing to some extent under the Constitution and
the Judiciary Act of 1789, § 9, Judicial Code, §§ 24, 256, may not
contravene the essential purposes of an act of Congress, work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime
law or interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law
in its international and interstate relations.
Work performed by a stevedore on board a ship in unloading her at
wharf in navigable waters is maritime; his employment for such work
and injuries suffered in it are likewise maritime, and the rights and
liabilities arising from such work, employment and injuries are
clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transport Co. v.
Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52.
A stevedore engaged on an interstate ship in unloading her at wharf in
navigable waters in New York was accidentally injured and killed,
and an award of compensation was made against the shipowner
by the New York Workmen's Compensation Commission under the
New York Workmen's Compensation Act (New York Central R. R.
Co. v. White, 243 U. S. 188), and affirmed by the courts of that State.
Held, that the act as applied to such a case was in conflict with the
Constitution and to that extent invalid.
The remedy of the New York Workmen's Compensation Act (it provides compensation upon a prescribed scale for injuries and deaths
of employees, without regard to fault, to be administered and
awarded primarily through a state administrative commission),
is a remedy unknown to the common law and incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court, and hence is not among
the common-law remedies which are saved to suitors from the
exclusive admiralty jurisdiction by Judiciary Act of 1789, § 9; Judicial Code, §§ 24, 256.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.
244 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The remedy of the New York Workmen's Compensation Act is inconsistent with the policy of Congress to encourage investments in
ships, manifested by the Acts of 1851 and 1884 (Rev. Stats., §§ 42834285; c. 121, 23 Stat. 57), which declare a limitation upon the liability of their owners.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

was on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, with whom Mr. EgburtE. Woodbury, Attorney General of the State of New York, and

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

court.
Upon a claim regularly presented, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission of New York made the following findings of fact, rulings and award, October 9, 1914:
"1. Christen Jensen, the deceased workman, was, on
August 15, 1914, an employee of the Southern Pacific
Company, a corporation of the State of Kentucky, where
it has its principal office. It also has an office at Pier 49,
North River, New York City. The Southern Pacific
Company at said time was, and still is, a common carrier
by railroad. It also owned and operated a steamship El
Oriente, plying between the ports of New York and
Galveston, Texas.
"2. On August 15, 1914, said steamship was berthed

for discharging and loading at Pier 49, North River, lying
in navigable waters of the United States.
"3. On said date Christen Jensen was operating a small
electric freight truck. His work consisted in driving the
truck into the steamship El Oriente where it was loaded
with cargo, then driving the truck out of the vessel upon
a gangway connecting the vessel with Pier 49, North
River, and thence upon the pier, where the lumber was
unloaded from the truck. The ship was about 10 feet
distant from the pier. At about 10:15 A. M., after Jensen
had been doing such work for about three hours that
morning, he started out. of the ship with his truck loaded
with lumber, a part of the cargo of the steamship El
Oriente, which was being transported from Galveston,
Texas, to New York City. Jensen stood on the rear of the
truck, the lumber coming about to his shoulder. In
driving out of the port in the side of the vessel and upon
the gangway, the truck became jammed against the guide
pieces on the gangway. Jensen then reversed the direction of the truck and proceeded at third or full speed backward into the hatchway. He failed to lower his head and
his head struck the ship at the top line, throwing his head
forward and causing his chin to hit the lumber in front of
him. His neck was broken and in this manner he met his
death.
"4. The business of the Southern Pacific Company in
this State consisted at the time of the accident and now
consists solely in carrying passengers and merchandise
between New York and other States. Jensen's work consisted solely in moving cargo destined to and from other
States.
"5. Jensen left him surviving Marie Jensen, his widow,
29 years of age, and Howard Jensen, his son, seven years
of age, and Evelyn Jensen, his daughter, three years of age.
"6. Jensen's average weekly wage was $19.60 per week.
"7. The injury was an accidental injury and arose out of

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.
244 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and in the course of Jensen's employment by the Southern
Pacific Company and his death was due to such injury.
The injury did not result solely from the intoxication of
the injuied employee while on duty, and was not occasioned by the wilful intention of the injured employee to
bring about the injury or death of himself or another."
"This claim comes within the meaning of Chapter 67
of the Consolidated Laws as re-enacted and amended by
Chapter 41 of the Laws of 1914, and as amended by Chapter 316 of the Laws of 1914."
"Award of compensation is hereby made to Marie
Jensen, widow of the deceased, at the rate of $5.87 weekly
during her widowhood -with two years' compensation in
one sum in case of her remarriage; to Harold Jensen, son
of the deceased, at the rate of $1.96 per week and to
Evelyn Jensen, daughter of the deceased, at the rate of
$1.96 per week until the said Harold Jensen and Evelyn
Jensen respectively shall arrive at the age of eighteen
years, and there is further allowed the sum of One Hundred
($100) Dollars for funeral expenses."
In due time the Southern Pacific Company objected to
the award "upon the grounds that the Act does not apply
because the workman was engaged in interstate commerce
on board a vessel of a foreign corporation of the State of
Kentucky which was engaged solely in interstate commerce; that the injury was one with respect to which
Congress may establish, and has established, a rule of
liability, and under the language of Section 114,1 [copied
Section 114. "The provisions of this chapter shall apply to employers and employees engaged in intrastate, and also in interstate or
foreign commerce, for whom a rule of liability or method of compensation has been or may be established by the Congress of'the United
States, only to the extent that their mutual connection with intrastate
work may and shall be clearly separable and distinguishable from interstate or foreign commerce, except that such employer and his employees

in the margin] the Act has no application; on the ground
.that the Act includes only those engaged in the operation
of vessels other than those of other states and countries
in foreign and interstate commerce, while the work upon
which the deceased workman was engaged at the time of
his death was part of the operation of a vessel of another
state engaged in interstate commerce, and hence does not
come within the provisions of the Act; further, that the
Act is unconstitutional, as it constitutes a regulation of
and burden upon commerce among the several States in
violation of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of the
United States; in that it takes property without due
process of law in violation of the 14th Amendment of the
Constitution; in that it denies the Southern Pacific Company the equal protection of the laws in violation of the
14th Amendment of the Constitution because the Act
does not afford an exclusive remedy, but leaves the employer and its vessels subject to suit in admiralty; also
that the Act is unconstitutional in that it violates Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution conferring admiralty jurisdiction upon the courts of the United States."
Without opinion, the Appellate Division approved the
award and the Court of Appeals affirmed this action
(215 N. Y. 514, 519), holding that the Workmen's Compensation Act applied to the employment in question and
was not obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. It said:
"The scheme of the statute is essentially and fundamentally one by the creation of a state fund to insure the payment of a prescribed compensation based on earnings for
disability or death from accidental injuries sustained by
employees engaged in certain enumerated hazardous employments. The state fund is created from premiums
manner provided by the commission and so far as not forbidden by any
act of Congress, accept and become bound by the provisions of this
chapter in like manner and with the same effect in all respects as provided herein for other employers and their employees."

Opinion of the Court.

paid by employers based on the payroll, the number of
employees and the hazards of the employment. The
employer has the option of insuring with any stock corporation or mutual association authorized to transact.
such business, or of furnishing satisfactory proof to the
commission of his own financial ability to pay. If he. does
neither he is liable to a penalty equal to the pro rata
premium payable to the state fund during the period of
his non-compliance and is subject to a suit for damages by
the injured employee, or his legal representative in case
of death, in which he is deprived of the defenses of contributory negligence, assumed risk and negligence of a
fellow-servant. By insuring in the state fund, or by himself or his insurance carrier paying the prescribed compensation, the employer is relieved from further liability
for personal injuries or death sustained by employees.
Compensation is to be made without regard to fault as a
cause of the injury, except where it is occasioned by the
willful intention of the injured employee to bring about
the injury or death of himself or another or results solely
from his intoxication while on duty. Compensation is not
based on the rule of damages applied in negligence suits
but in addition to providing for medical, surgical or other
attendance or treatment and funeral expenses it is based
solely on loss of earning power. Thus the risk of accidental
injuries occurring with or without fault on the part either
of employee or employer is shared by both and the burden
of making compensation is distributed over all the enumerated hazardous employments in proportion to the risk
involved." See also Walker v. Clyde Steamship Co., 215
N. Y. 529.
In New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, 243 U. S. 188,
we held the statute valid in certain respects; and, considering what was there said, only two of the grounds
relied on for reversal now demand special cinsideration.
First. Plaintiff in error being an interstate common

carrier by railroad is responsible for injuries received by
employees while engaged therein under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65,
and no state statute can impose any other or different
liability. Second. As here applied, the Workmen's
Compensation Act conflicts with the general maritime
law, which constitutes an integral part of the federal law
under Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution, and to that extent
is invalid.
The Southern Pacific Company, a Kentucky Corporation, owns and operates a railroad as a common carrier;
also the steamship El Oriente plying between New York
and Galveston, Texas. The claim is that therefore rights
and liabilities of the parties -here must be determined in
accordance with the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
But we think that act is not applicable in the circumstances.
The first Federal Employers' Liability Act (June. 11,
1906, c. 3073, 34 Stat. 232) extended in terms to all common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,
and because it embraced subjects not within the constitutional authority of Congress was declared invalid.
The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S.463, January 6,
1908. The later act is carefully limited and provides
that "every common carrier by railroad while engaging
in commerce between any of the several States or Territories, or between any of the States and Territories, or
between the District of Columbia and any of the
States and Territories, or between the District of
Columbia or any of the States and Territories and any
foreign nation or nations, shall be liable in damages to
any person suffering injury while he is employed by such
carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such
employee, to his or her personal representative, for the
benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children
of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.
244 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent
upon such employee, for such injury or death resulting
in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the
officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason
of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its
cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed,
works, boats, wharves, or other equipment."
Evidently the purpose was to prescribe a rule applicable
where the parties are engaging in something having direct
and substantial connection with railroad operations, and
not with another kind of carriage recognized as separate
and distinct from transportation on land and no mere
adjunct thereto. It is unreasonable to suppose that
Congress intended to change long-established rules applicable to maritime matters merely because the oceangoing ship concerned happened to be owned and operated
by a company also a common carrier by railroad. The
word "boats" in the statute refers to vessels which may
be properly regarded as in substance but part of a railroad's extension or equipment as understood and applied
in common practice.
The fundamental purpose of the Compensation Law as
declared by the Court of Appeals is "the creation of a
state fund to insure the payment of a prescribed compensation based on earnings for disability or death from
accidental injuries sustained by employees engaged in
certain enumerated hazardous employments," among
them being "longshore work, including the loading or
unloading 'of cargoes or parts of cargoes of grain, coal,
ore, freight, general merchandise, lumber or other products
or materials, or moving or handling the same on any dock,
platform or place, or in any warehouse or other place of
storage."
Its general provisions are specified in our
opinion in New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, supra, and
need not be repeated. Under the construction adopted
by the state courts no ship -may load or discharge her

cargo at a dock therein without incurring a penalty, unless
her owners comply with the act which, in order to secure
payment of compensation for accidents, generally without
regard to fault and based upon annual wages, provides
(§ 50) that-"An employer shall secure compensation to
his employees in one of the following ways:
"1. By insuring and keeping insured the payment of
such compensation in the state fund, or-2. By insuring
and keeping insured the payment of such compensation
with any stock corporation or mutual association authorized to transact the business of workmen's compensation
insurance in this state. If insurance be so effected in such
a corporation or mutual association the employer shall
forthwith file with the commission, in form prescribed by
it, a notice specifying the name of such insurance corporation or mutual association together with a copy of the
contract or policy of insurance.-3. By furnishing satisfactory proof to the commission of his financial ability
to pay such compensation for himself, in which case the
commission may, in its discretion, require the deposit
with the commission of securities of the kind prescribed in
section thirteen of the insurance law, in an amount to be
determined by the commission, to secure his liability to
pay the compensation provided in this chapter."
"If an employer fail to comply with this section, he
shall be liable to a penalty during which such failure continues of an amount equal to the pro rata premium which
would have been payable for insurance in the state fund
for such period of noncompliance to be recovered in an
action brought by the commission."
Article III, § 2, of the Constitution, extends the judicial
power of the United States "To all cases of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction;" and Article I, § 8, confers
upon the Congress power "To make all laws which may
be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Con-

Opinion of the Court.

stitution in the government of the United States or in any
department or officer thereof." Considering our former
opinions, it must now be accepted as settled doctrine that
in consequence of these provisions Congress has paramount power to fix and determine the maritime law
which shall prevail throughout the country. Butler v.
Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., 130 U. S. 527; In re
Garnett, 141 U. S. 1, 14. And furthe, that in the absence
of some controlling statute the general maritime law as
accepted by the federal courts constitutes part of our
national law applicable to matters within the admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558;
Butler v. Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., 130 U. S. 527,
557; Workman v. New York City, 179 U. S. 552.
In The Lottawanna,Mr. Justice Bradley speaking for the
court said: "That we have a maritime law of our own,
operative throughout the United States, cannot be
doubted. The general system of maritime law which was
familiar to the lawyers and statesmen of the country when
the Constitution was adopted, was most certainly intended and referred to when it was declared in that
instrument that the judicial power of the United States
shall extend 'to all cases of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction.' . . . One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must have referred to a system of
law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the
whole country. It certainly could not have been intended
to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the
disposal and regulation of the several States, as that would
have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which
the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial
character affecting the intercourse of the States with each
other or with foreign states."
By § 9, Judiciary Act of i789, 1 Stat. 76, 77, the District Courts of the United States were given "exclusive
original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and

maritime jurisdiction; . . . saving to suitors, in all
cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it." And this grant has
been continued. Judicial Code, §§ 24 and 256.
In view of these constitutional provisions and the federal act it would be difficult, if not impossible, to define
with exactness just how far the general maritime law may
be changed, modified, or affected by state legislation.
That this may be done to some extent cannot be denied.
A lien upon a vessel for repairs in her own port may be
given by state statute, The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 579,
580; The J. E. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1; pilotage fees fixed,
Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299; Ex parte McNiel,
13 Wall. 236, 242; and the right given to recover in death
cases, The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398; La Bourgogne, 210
U. S. 95, 138. See The City of Norwalk, 55 Fed. Rep. 98,
106. Equally well established is the rule that state statutes may not contravene an applicable act of Congress or
affect the general maritime law beyond certain limits.
They cannot authorize proceedings in rem according to the
course in admiralty, The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411; Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 534; The Glide, 167 U. S.
606; nor create liens for materials used in repairing a
foreign ship, The Roanoke, 189 U. S.185. See Workman v.
New York City,. 179 U. S.552. And plainly, we think, no
such legislation is valid if it contravenes the essential purpose expressed by an act of Congress or works material
prejudice to the characteristic features of the general
maritime law or interferes with the proper harmony and
uniformity of that law in its international and interstate
relations. This limitation, at the least, is essential to the
effective operation of the fundamental purposes for which
such law was incorporated into our national laws by the
Constitution itself. These purposes are forcefully indicated in the foregoing quotations from The Lottawanna.
A similar rule in respect to interstate commerce deduced

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.

244 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

from the grant to Congress of power to regulate it is now
firmly established. "Where the subject is national in its
character, and admits" and requires uniformity of regulation, affecting alike all the States, such as transportation
between the States, including the importation of goods
from one State into another, Congress can alone act upon
it and provide the needed regulations. The absence of any
law of Congress on the subject is equivalent to its declaration that commerce in that matter shall be free." Bowman
v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., 125 U. S. 465, 507,
508; Vance y. Vandercook Co., 170 U. S. 438, 444; Clark
Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., 242 U. S. 311.
And the same character of reasoning which supports this
rule, we think, makes imperative the stated limitation
upon the power of the States to interpose where maritime
matters are involved.
The work of a stevedore in which the deceased was engaging is maritime in its nature; his employment was a
maritime contract; the injuries which he received were
likewise maritime; and the rights and liabilities of the
parties in connection therewith were matters clearly
within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transvort Co.
v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52, 59, 60.
If New York can subject foreign ships coming into her
ports to such obligations as those imposed by her Compensation Statute, other States may do likewise. The
necessary consequence would be destruction of the very
uniformity in respect to maritime matters which the Constitution was designed to establish; and freedom of navigation between the States and with foreign countries would
be seriously hampered and impeded. A far more serious
injury would result to commerce than could have been
inflicted by the Washington statute authorizing a materialman's lien condemned in The Roanoke. The legislature
exceeded its authority in attempting to extend the statate
under consideration to conditions like those here disclosed.

So applied, it conflicts with the Constitution and to that
extent is invalid.
Exclusive jurisdiction of all civil cases of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction is vested in the Federal District
Courts, "saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a
common law remedy, where the common law is competent
to give it." The remedy which the Compensation Statute
attempts to give is of a character wholly unknown to the
common law, incapable of enforcement by the ordinary
processes of any court and is not saved to suitors from the
grant of exclusive jurisdiction. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall.
555, 571, 572; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644; Steamboat Co.
v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 531, 533; The Glide, 167 U. S. 606,
623. And finally this remedy is not consistent with the
policy of Congress to encourage investments in ships manifested in the Acts of 1851 and 1884 (Rev. Stats., §§ 42834285; § 18, Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, 23 Stat. 57) which
declare a limitation upon the liability of their owners.

The judgment of the court below must be reversed and

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES,

dissenting.

The Southern Pacific Company has been held liable
under the statutes of New York for an accidental injury
happening upon a gang-plank between a pier and the company's vessel and causing the death of one of its employees.
The company not having insured as permitted, the statute
may be taken as if it simply imposed a limited but absolute liability in such a case. The short question is
whether the power of the State to regulate the liability
in that place and to enforce it in the State's own courts
is taken away by the conferring of exclusive jurisdiction

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.

HOLMES, J., dissenting.

of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
upon the courts of the United States.
There is no doubt that the saving to suitors of the right
of a common-law remedy leaves open the common-law
jurisdiction of the state courts, and leaves some power of
legislation at least, to the States. For the latter I need do
no more than refer to state pilotage statutes, and to liens
created by state laws in aid of maritime contracts. Nearer
to the point, it is decided that a statutory remedy for
causing death may be enforced by the state courts, although the death was due to a collision upon the high seas.
Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522. Sherlock v. Alling,

U. S. 638, 646. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 409.
The misgivings of Mr. Justice Bradley were adverted to
in The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398, and held at least insufficient to prevent the admiralty from recognizing such a
state-created right in a proper case, if indeed they
went to any such extent. La Bourgogne, 210 U. S. 95,
138.
The statute having been upheld in other respects, New
York Central R. R. Co. v. White, 243 U. S. 188, I should
have thought these authorities conclusive. The liability
created by the New York act ends in a money judgment,
and the mode in which the amount is ascertained, or is to
be paid, being one that the State constitutionally might
adopt, cannot matter to the question before us if any
liability can be imposed that was not known to the maritime law. And as such a liability can be imposed where
it was unknown not only to the maritime but to the common law, I can see no difference between one otherwise
constitutionally created for death caused by accident and
one for death due to fault. Neither can the statutes limiting the liability of owners affect the case. Those statutes
extend to non-maritime torts, which of course are the
creation of state law. Richardson v. Harmon, 222 U. S.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
HOLmES, J., dissenting.

244 U. S.

96, 104. They are paramount to but not inconsistent with
the new cause of action. However, as my opinion stands
on grounds that equally would support a judgment for a
maritime tort not ending in death, with which admiralty
courts have begun to deal, I will state the reasons that
satisfy my mind.
No doubt there sometimes has been an air of benevolent
gratuity in the admiralty's attitude about enforcing state
laws. But of course there is no gratuity about it. Courts
cannot give or withhold at pleasure. If the claim is enforced or recognized it is because the claim is a right, and
if a claim depending upon a state statute is enforced it is
because the State had constitutional power to pass the
law. Taking it as established that a State has constitutional power to pass laws giving rights and imposing
liabilities for acts done upon the high seas when there were
no such rights. or liabilities before, what is there to hinder
its doing so in the case of a maritime tort? Not the existence of an inconsistent law emanating from a superior
source, that is, from the United States. There is no such
law. The maritime law is not a corpus juris-it is a very
limited. body of customs and ordinances of the sea. The
nearest to anything of the sort in question was the rule
that a seaman was entitled to recover the expenses necessary for his cure when the master's negligence caused his
hurt. The maritime law gave him'no more. The Osceola,
189 U. S. 158, 175. One may affirm with the sanction of
that case that if is an innovation to allQw suits in the
admiralty by seamen to recover damages for personal
injuries caused by the negligence of the master and to
apply the common-law principles -of tort.
Now, however, common-law principles have been
applied to sustain a libel by a stevedore in personam
against the master for personal injuries suffered while
loading a ship, Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, 234
U. S.52; and The Osceola recognizes that in some cases at

least seamen may have similar relief. From what source
do these new rights come? The earliest case relies upon
"the analogies of the municipal law," The Edith Godden,
23 Fed. Rep. 43, 46,-sufficient evidence of the obvious
pattern, but inadequate for the specific origin. I recognize
without hesitation that judges do and must legislate,
but they can do so only interstitially; they are confined
from molar to molecular motions. A common-law judge
could not say I think the doctrine of consideration a bit
of historical nonsense and shall not enforce it in my court.
No more could a judge exercising the limited jurisdiction
of admiralty say I think well of the common-law rules of
master and servant and prop6se to introduce them here
en bloc. Certainly he could not in that way enlarge the
exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts and cut down
the power of the States. If admiralty adopts common-law
rules without an act of Congress it cannot extend the
maritime law as understood by the Constitution. It must
take the rights of the parties from a different authority,
just as it does when it enforces a lien created by a State.
The only authority available is the common law or statutes of a State. For from the often repeated statement
that there is no common law of the United States, Wheaton
v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 658; Western Union Telegraph Co. v.
Call Publishing Co., 181 U. S. 92, 101, and from the principles recognized in Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek
having been unknown to the maritime law, the natural
inference is that in the silence of Congress this court has
believed the very limited law of the sea to be supplemented
here as in England by the common law, and that here that
means, by the common law of the State. Sherlock v.
Alling, 93 U. S. 99, 104. Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583,
598. So far as I know, the state courts have made this
assumption without criticism or attempt at revision from
the beginning to this day; e. g. Wilson v. MacKenzie, 7
Hill (N. Y.), 95. Gabrielson v. Waydell, 135 N. Y. 1, 11.

Even where the admiralty has unquestioned jurisdiction
the common law may have concurrent authority and the
state courts concurrent power. Schoonmaker v. Gilmore,
102 U. S. 118. The invalidity of state attempts to create
a remedy for maritime' contracts or torts, parallel to that
in the admiralty, that was established in such cases as The
Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, and The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall.
555, is immaterial to the present point.
The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the
sky but the articulate voice of some sovereign or quasisovereign that can be identified; although some decisions
with which I have disagreed seem to me to have forgotten
the fact. It always is the law of some State, and if the
District Courts adopt the common law of torts, as they
have shown a tendency to do, they thereby assume that
a law not of maritime origin and deriving its authority in
that territory only from some particular State of this
Union also governs maritime torts in that territory-and
if the common law, the statute law has at least equal force,
as the discussion in The Osceola assumes. On the other
hand the refusal of the District Courts to give remedies
coextensive with the common law would prove no more
than that they regarded their jurisdiction as limited by
the ancient lines-not that they doubted that the common
law might and would be enforced in the courts of the
States as it always has been. This court has recognized
that in some cases different principles of liability would be
applied as the suit should happen to be brought in a
common-law or admiralty court. Compare The Max
Morris, 137 U. S. 1, with Belden v. Chase, 150 U. S. 674,
691. But hitherto it has not been doubted authoritatively,
so far as I know, that even when the admiralty had a rule
of its own to which it adhered, as in Workman v. New York
City, 179 U. S. 552, the state law, common or statute,

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.

PrNEY, J., dissenting.

would prevail in the courts of the State. Happily such
conflicts are few.
It might be asked why, if the grant of jurisdiction to the
courts of the United'States imports a power in Congress
to legislate, the saving of a common-law remedy, i. e.,
in the state courts, did not import a like if subordinate
power in the States. But leaving that question on one
side, such cases as Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522,
The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398, and Atlantic Transport Co.
v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52, show that it is too late to say
that the mere silence of Congress excludes the statute or
common law of a State from supplementing the wholly inadequate maritime law of the time of the Constitution, in
the regulation of personal rights, and I venture to say that
it never has been supposed to do so, or had any such effect.
As to the spectre of a lack of uniformity I content myself with referring to The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398, 406.
The difficulty really is not so great as in the case of interstate carriers by land, which "in the absence of Federal
statute providing a different. rule are answerable according
to the law of the State for nonfeasance or misfeasance
within its limits." The Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S.
352,. 408, and cases cited. The conclusion that I reach
accords with the considered cases of Lindstrom v. Mutual
Steamship Co., 132 Minnesota, 328; Kennerson v. Thames
Towboat ,7o., 89 Connecticut, 367; and North Pacific S. S.
Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission of California, 163

. 241 U. S.

This dissent is confined to that part of the prevailing
opinion which holds that the Workmen's Compensation
Act of New York, as applied by the state court to a fatal
injury sustained by a stevedore while engaged in work of
a maritime nature upon navigable water within that State,
conflicts with the Constitution of the United States and
the act of Congress conferring admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction in civil cases upon the district courts of the
United States, and is to that extent invalid. Except for
the statute, an action might have been brought in a court
of admiralty. Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, 234
U. S. 52, 62. No question is raised respecting the jurisdiction of the state court over the subject matter. But plaintiff in error contends, and the prevailing opinion holds,
that it was a violation of a federal right for the state court
to apply the provisions of the local statute to a cause of
action of maritime origin, because, by the Constitution of
the United States, admiralty jurisdiction was conferred
upon the federal courts.
It should be stated, at the outset, that the case involves
no question of penAlties imposed by the New York act,
but affects solely the responsibility of the employer to
make compensation to the widow, in accordance with its
provisions, which are outlined in New York Central R. R.
Co. v. White, 243 U. S. 188, 192-195.
The argument is that even in the absence of any act of
Congress prescribing the responsibility of a shipowner to
his stevedore, the general maritime law, as accepted by
the federal courts when acting in the exercise of their
admiralty jurisdiction, mu~t be adopted as the rule of
decision by state cDurts of common law when passing
upon any case that might have been brought in the admiralty; and that just as the absence of an act of Congress
regulating interstate commerce in some cases is equivalent
to a declaration by Congress that commerce in that respect
shall be free, so non-action by Congress amounts to an im-

PrnzY, J., dissenting.

perative limitation upon the power of the States to interpose where maritime matters are involved.
This view is so entirely unsupported by precedent, and
will have such novel and far-reaching consequences, that
it ought not to be accepted without the most thorough
consideration.
Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution reads as
follows: "The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases,
in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the
Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which
shall be made, under their Authority i-to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to
Controversies to which the United States shall be a
Party;-to Controversies between two or more States;between a State and Citizens of another State;--between
Citizens of diifferent States ;-between Citizens of the same
State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and
between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign
States, Citizens or Subjects." Acting under the authority
of Article I, § 8, which empowers Congress. to make all
laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
powers vested in the Government or in any department
or officer thereof, the First Congress, in the original Judiciary Act (A ct of September 24i 1789, c. 20, § 9, 1 Stat. 73,
77), conferred upon the federal district courts "exclusive
original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction, . . . saving to suitors, in all
cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it." The saving clause has
been preserved in all subsequent revisions. Rev. Stats.,
§ 563 (8); Jud. Code, § 24, (3), 36 Stat. 1087, 1091, c. 231.
From the language quoted from the Constitution, read
in the light of the general purpose of that instrument and
the contemporaneous construction found in the Judiciary
Act, with regard also to the mischiefs that called for the

establishment of a national judiciary, and from what I
believe to be the unbroken current of decisions in this
court from that day until the present, I draw the following
conclusions: (1) That the framers of the Constitution intended to establish jurisdiction-the power to hear and
determine controversies of the various classes specifiedand not to prescribe particularcodes or systems of law for
the decision of those controversies; (2) That the civil
jurisdiction in admiralty Was not intended to be exclusive
of the courts of common law, at least not until Congress
should deem it proper so to enact; (3) That by the law
of England, and by the practice of the colonial governments, the courts of common law, of equity, and of admiralty, were controlled in their decisions by separate
and in a sense independent systems of substantive law,
and the constitutional grant of judicial power in "all cases
in law and equity," and in "all cases of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction," was no more intended (in the
absence of legislation by Congress) to make the rules of
maritime law binding upon the federal courts of common
law when exercising their concurrent jurisdiction, than
to make the rules of the common law binding upon the
courts of admiralty; (4) That if not binding upon the
federal courts, it results, a fortiori, that the rules of maritime law were not intended to be made binding upon the
courts of the States; (5) That it is not necessary, in order
to give full effect to the grant of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction, to imply that the rules of decision prevailing
in admiralty must be binding upon common-law courts
exercising concurrent jurisdiction in civil causes of maritime origin, and to give such a construction to the Constitution is to render unconstitutional the saving clause in
§ 9 of the Judiciary Act, and also to trench upon the proper
powers of the States by interfering with their control over
their water-borne internal commerce; and (6) That, in the
absence of legislation by Congress abrogating the saving

clause, the States are at liberty to administer their own
laws in their own courts when exercising a jurisdiction
concurrent with that of admiralty, and at liberty to change
those laws by statute.
That the language of §2 of Art. III of the Constitution
speaks only of' establishing jurisdiction, and does not
prescribe the niode in which or the substantive law by
which the exercise of that jurisdiction is to be governed,
seems to me entirely plain; and upon this point I need only
refer to the language itself, which I have quoted.
That this view is in harmony with the general purpose
of the Constitution seems to me equally plain. At this
late date it ought not to' be necessary to repeat that the
object of the framers of that, instrument was to lay the
foundations of a government, to set up its frame-work,
and to establish merely the general principles by which it
was to be animated; avoiding, as far as possible, any but
the most fundamental regulations for controlling its
operations, and these usually in the form of restrictions.

Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326.
The object .was to enumerate, rather than to define, the
powers granted. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 194;

judicial power, leaving the details to Congress, while pro-'
viding for the organization of the legislative department
and the mode in which and the restrictions under which
its authority should be exercised. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. '657, 721. The reason for adopting general'outlines only was well expressed by Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407:
"A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the
subdivisions of wtich its great powers will admit, and of all
the means by which they may be carried into execution,
would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could

scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires, that only its great outlines should be
marked, its important objects designated, and the minor
ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from
the nature of the objects themselves. That this idea was
entertained by the framers of the American constitution,
is not only to be inferred from the nature of the instrument, but from the language."
The adoption of any particular system of substantive
law wag not within the purpose of the Constitutional
Convention; and the clause establishing the judicial
power was ill-adapted to the purpose had it existed. So
far as they intended to prescribe permanent rules of substantive or even procedural law in connection with the
establishment of the judicial system, the framers employed
express terms for the purpose, as appears from other provisions of Article III, including the definition of treason,
the character of proof required, the limitation of the
punishment, and the requirement of a jury trial for this
and other crimes.
In a somewhat exhaustive examination of various
sources of information, including Elliot's Debates, Farrand's Records of the Federal Convention, and The Federalist, Nos. 80-83, I have been unable to find anything
even remotely suggesting that the judicial clause was
designed to establish the maritime bode or any other
system of laws for the determination of controversies in
the courts by it established, milch less any suggestion
that the maritime code was to constitute the rule
of decision in common-law courts, either federal or
state.
Certainly, there is nothing in the mere provision establishing jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime causes to
have that effect, unless the jurisdiction so established was
in its nature exclusive. But, in civil causes, the jurisdic-

J., dissenting.

tion was not exclusive by the law of England and of the
Colonies, and it was not made an exclusive jurisdiction
by the Constitution.
In discussing this point, the distinction between the
instance court and the prize court of admiralty must be
observed. It was held in England that the question of
prize or no prize, and other questions arising out of it,
were exclusively cognizable in the admiralty, because that
court took jurisdiction bwing to the fact of possession of a
prize of wax, and the controversy turned upon belligerent
rights and was determinable by the law of nations, and
not the particular municipal law of any country. Le Caux
v. Eden (1781), Doug. 594; 99 E. R. 375, 379-385; Lindo
v. Rodney, reported in a note to Le Caux v. Eden, Doug.
613; 99 E. R. 385; Smart v. Wolff (1789), 3 T. R. 323, 340,
et seq.; Lord Camden v. Home (1791), 4 T. R. 382, 393
et seq. But of civil actions in personam the instance court
exercised a jurisdiction concurrent with that of the courts
of common law. As Lord Mansfield said in Lindo v.
Rodney, Doug. 614: "A thing being done upon the high
sea don't exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of common
law. For seizing, stopping, or taking a ship, upon the
high sea, not as prize, an action will lie; but for taking as
prize, no action will lie. The nature of the question excludes; not the locality." And again, referring to the
effect of certain statutes (p. 614a): "The taking a ship
upon the high sea is triable at law to repair the plaintiff
in damages; but a' taking on the high sea as prize is not
triable at law to repair the plaintiff in damages. The
nature of the ground of the action-prize or no prize-not
only authorizes the prize court, but excludes the common
law. These statutes don't exclude the common law in any
case, and they confine the Admiralty by the locality of the
thing done, which is the cause of action. It must be done
upon the high sea."
So, with respect to actions ex contractu, Mr. Justice

Blackstone says, 3 Black. Com. 107: "It is no uncommon
thing for a plaintiff to feign that a contract, really made
at sea, was made at the royal exchange, or other inland
place, in order to draw the cognizance of the suit from the
courts of admiralty to those of Westminster Hall." The
concurrent jurisdiction of the courts of common law was
affirmed by Dr. Browne, the first edition of whose work
was published in 1797-1799. 2 Browne's Civ. & Adm. Law
(Ist Am. ed.), 112, 115.
The declaration of Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for this
court in New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants'
Bank, 6 How. 344, 390, that the lodging by the Constitution of the entire admiralty power in the federal judiciary,
and the ninth section of the Judiciary Act, with its saving
of common-law remedies, left the concurrent power of
the courts of common law and of admiralty where it stood
at common law, was not a chance remark. It has been so
ruled in many other cases, to which I shall refer hereafter.
The principles and history of the common law were well
known to the framers of the Constitution and the members of the First Ccngress; it was from that system that
their terminology was derived; and the provisions of the
Constitution and contemporaneous legislation must be
interpreted accordingly.
The statement that there is no common law of the
United States (Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 658; Smith
v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, 478) is true only in the sense
that the Constitution neither of its own force imposed, nor
authorized Congress to impose, the common law or any
other general body of laws upon the several States for the
regulation of their internal affairs. As was pointed out
in Smith v. Alabama (p. 478), "There is, however, one
clear exception to the statement that there is no national
common law. The interpretation of the Constitution of
the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact
that its'provisions are framed in the language of the Eng-

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.

lish common law, and are to be read in the light of its
history."
As was well expressed by Shiras, District Judge, in
Murray v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co., 62 Fed. Rep. 24, 31:
"From them [citations of the decisions of this court] it
appears, beyond question, that the Constitution, the
Judiciary Act of 1789, and all subsequent statutes upon
the same subject are based upon the general principles
of the common law, and that, to a large extent, the legislative and judicial action of the government would be
without support and without meaning if they cannot be interpreted in the light of the common law. When the Constitution was adopted, it was not the design of the framers
thereof to create any new systems of general law, nor to
supplant those already in existence. At that time there
were in existence and in force in the Colonies or States,
and among the people thereof, the law of nations, the
law admiralty and maritime, the common law, including
commercial law, and the system of equity. Upon these
foundations the Constitution was erected. The problem
sought to be solved was not whether the Constitution
should create or enact a law of nations, of admiralty, of
equity, or the like, but rather how should the executive,
legislative, and judicial powers and duties based upon these
systems, and necessary for the proper development and
enforcement thereof, be apportioned between the national
and state governments."
And it is not to be supposed that the framers of the
Constitution, familiar with the institutions and the prin,.ciples of the common law, by which the admiralty jurisdiction was allowed on sufferance, land with a degree of
jealousy born of the fact that the courts of admiralty were
not courts of record, that they followed the practice of the
civil law, allowed no trial by jury, and administered an
exotic system of laws (3 Black. Com. 69, 86, 87, 106-108)
-it is not to be supposed, I say, that the framers of the

Constitution, in granting judicial power over cases of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, along with like power
laws of
over all cases in law and equity arising under the

the United States, intended to exclude common-law courts,
state or national, from any part of their concurrent jurisdiction in cases of maritime origin, or to deprive them of
the judicial power, theretofore existing, to decide such
cases according to the rules of the common law.
It is matter of familiar history that one of the chief
weaknesses of the Confederation was in the absence of a
judicial establishment possessed, of general authority.
Except that the Continental Congress, as an incident of
the war power, was authorized to establish rules respecting
captures and the disposition of prizes of war and to appoint courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed
on the high sea, and for determining appeals in cases of
capture, and except that. the Congress itself, through
commissioners, was to exercise jurisdiction in disputes
between the States and in controversies respecting conflicting land grants of different States, there was no provision in the Articles of Confederation for establishing a
judicial system under the authority of the general government.
The result was that not only private parties, in cases
arising out of the laws of the Congress, but the United
States themselves, were obliged to resort to the courts
of the States for the enforcement of their rights. Many
cases of this character are reported, some even antedating
the Confederation. Respublica v. Sweers (1779), 1 Dall.
41; Respublica v. Powell (1780), 1 Dall. 47; Respublica v.
De Longchamps (1784), 1 DalU. 111. Even treason was
punished in state courts and under state laws. See cases
of Molder, Malin, Carlisle and Roberts (1778), 1 Dali.
33-39.
Before the Revolution, courts of admiralty jurisdiction
were a part of the judicial systems of the several Colonies.

PITNEY, J., dissenting.

Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 454-456; Benedict on
Admiralty, §§ 118-165. Upon the outbreak of the War
questions of prize law became acute, and the colonial
Congress, by resolutions of November 25, 1775, passed in
the exercise of the war power (3 Dall. 54, 80) made appropriate recommendations -for the treatment of prizes of
war, but remitted the jurisdiction over such questions to
the courts of the several Colonies, reserving to itself only
appellate authority. This system continued until the
year 1780 (after the submission of the Articles of Confederation, but before their final ratification), when the
Congress established a court for the hearing of appeals
from the state courts of admiralty in cases of capture.
The opinions of this court are reported in 2 Dall. 1-42, and
numerous cases decided without opinion, as well as some
of those decided by committees of the Congress prior to
the establishment of the court, are referred to in the late
Bancroft Davis' "Federal Courts Before the Constitution," 131 U. S., Appendix, xix-xlix. The weak point of
this system was the want of power in the central government to enforce the judgment of the appellate tribunal
when it chanced to reverse the decree of a state court.
There were some curious cases of conflicting jurisdiction,
illustrated by Doane v. penhallow (1787), 1 Dall. 218, 221;
Penhallow v. Doane (1795), 3 Dall. 54, 79, 86; and United
States v. Peters (1809), 5 Cranch, 115, 135, 137.
It was under the influence of numerous experiences of
the inefficiency of a general government unendowed with
judicial authority that the Constitutional Convention
assembled in the year 1787. The fundamental need, to
which the Convention addressed itself in framing the
judiciary article, was to set up a judicial power covering
all subjects of national concern. There was no greatr
need to establish jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime
causes than over controversies arising under the Constitution and laws of the Union. There was no purpose to

establish a system of substantive law in any of the several
classes of cases included within the grant of judicial power.
The language employed makes it plain that, with the
few express exceptions already noted (treason, etc.), the
rules of decision were to be sought elsewhere. The entire
absence of a purpose to establish a maritime code is manifest not only from the omission of any reference to the
laws of Oleron, the laws of Wisbuy, or any other of the
maritime codes recognized by the nations of Europe, but
further from the fact that the Colonies differed among
themselves as to maritime law and admiralty practice,
and that their system in general differed from that which
was administered in England. The evident purpose, in
this as in the other classes of controversy, was that the
courts of admiralty should administer justice according
to the previous course and practice of such courts in the
Colonies, just as the courts of common-law and equity
jurisdiction were to proceed according to the several
systems of substantive law appropriate to courts of their
respective kinds; subject, of course, to the power of Congress to change the rules of law respecting matters lying
within its appropriate sphere of action.
Undoubtedly the framers of the Constitution were advised of the ancient controversy in England between the
common-law courts and the courts of admiralty respecting
the extent of the jurisdiction of the latter. They were
aware of the dual function of the admiralty courts as
courts of instance and as prize courts, and of the established rule that in civil causes the jurisdiction of the instance court was concurrent with that of the courts of
common law. They must have known that, whatever
question had existed as to the territorial limits of the
jurisdiction of the admiralty, it never had been questioned
that in suits for mariners' wages and suits upon policies
of marine insurance, and in other actions ex contractu
having a maritime character, and also in actions of tort

PITNEY, J., dissenting:

arising upon the sea, the courts of common law exercised,
and long had exercised, concurrent jurisdiction. Whatever
early doubts may have existed had been based not upon
any inherent incapacity of the common-law courts to deal
with the subject matters, but upon the ancient theory of
the venue, and disappeared with the recognition of the
fictitious venue.
The grant of judicial power in cases of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction never has been construed as excluding the jurisdiction of the courts of common law over
civil causes that before the Constitution were subject
to the concurrent jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty
and the common-law courts. The First Congress did
not so construe it, as the saving clause in the Judiciary
Act conclusively shows. And, assuming that t:e States,
in the absence of legislation by Congress, would be without power over the subject matter, this saving clause,
still maintained upon the statute book, is, a sufficient
grant of power. Jurisdiction in prize cases, as has been
shown, springs out of the possession of a prize of war.
Civil proceedings in rem, to be mentioned hereafter, are
based upon the maritime lien, where possession in the
claimant is neither necessary nor usual as is the case with
common-law liens. With these exceptions, both resting
upon grounds peculiar to the forum of the admiralty,
concurrent jurisdiction of the courts of common law in
civil cases of maritime origin always has been recognized
by this court. New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 390; Propeller Genesee Chief v.

at the time of the passage of the Judiciary Act. It includes
statutory changes. Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522,
533, 534; Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638,
644. Those remedies which were held not to be commonlaw remedies, within the saving clause, in The Moses
Taylor; 4 Wall. 411, 427, 431; The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall.
555, 571, 572; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644; Steamboat
Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522,'533, and The Glide, 167 U. S.
606, 623, provided for imposing a lien on the ship by proceedings in the nature of admiralty process in rem, and
it was for this reason only that they were held to trench
upon the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the courts
of the United States. The distinction was noticed in Leon
v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185, 189, and again in Knapp, Stout
& Co. v. McCaifrey, 177 U. S.. 638, 642. In the latter case
it was pointed out (p. 644) that the reservation of a
common-law remedy where the common law is competent
to give it was not confined to common-law actions but
included remedies without-action, such as a distress for
rent or for the trespass of cattle; a bailee's remedy by
detaining personal property until paid for work done upon
it or for expenses incurred in keeping it; the lien of an innkeeper upon the goods of his guests, and that of a carrier
upon things carried; the remedy of a nuisance by abatement, and others. The most recent definition of the rule
laid down in The Hine V. Trevor and other cases of that
class is in Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine Co.,
237 U. S. 303.
I have endeavored to show, from a consideration' of the
phraseology of the constitutional grant of jurisdiction and
the act of the First Congress passed to give effect to it,
from the history in the, light of which the language of those
instruments is to be interpreted, and from the uniform
course of decision in this court from the earliest time until
the present, these propositions: First, that the grant of
jurisdiction to the admiralty was not intended to be ex-

clusive of the concurrent jurisdiction of the common-law
courts theretofore recognized; and, secondly, that neither
the Constitution nor the Judiciary Act was intended to
prescribe a system of substantive law to govern the several
courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction, much less to
make the rules of decision, prevalent in any one court,
obligatory upon others, exercising a distinct jurisdiction,
or binding upon the courts of the States when acting
within the bounds of their respective jurisdictions. In
fact, while courts of admiralty undoubtedly were expected
to administer justice according to the law of nations and
the customs of the sea, they were left at liberty to lay hold
of common-law principles where these were suitable to
their purpose, and even of applicable state statutes, just
as courts of cbmmon law were at liberty to adopt the rules
of maritime law as guides in the proper performance of
their duties. This eclectic method had been practiced by
the courts of each jurisdiction prior to the Constitution,
and there is nothing in that instrument to constrain them
to abandon it.
The decisions of this court show that the
courts of
admiralty in many matters are bound by local law. The
doubt expressed by Mr. Justice Bradley in Butler v. Boston
& Savannah Steamship Co., 130 U. S. 527, 558, as to
whether a state law could have force to create a liability
in a maritime case at all, was laid aside in The Corsair, 145
U. S. 335, and definitely set at rest in The Hamilton, 207
U. S. 398, 404. The fact is that, long before Butler v.
Boston & Savannah Steamship Co., it had been recognized
that state laws might not merely create a liability in a
maritime case, but impose a duty upon the admiralty
courts of the United States to enforce such liability. Thus,
while it was recognized that by the general maritime law
a foreign ship, or a ship in a port of a State to which she
did not belong, was subject to a suit in rem in the admiralty for repairs or necessaries, the case of a ship in a

port of her home State was governed by the municipal
law of the State, and no lien for repairs or necessaries
would be implied unless recognized by that law. The
General Smith. (1819), 4 Wheat. 438, 443; The Lottdwanna,
21 Wall. 558, 571, 578. Conversely, it was held in the case
of The'Planter (Peyrouxv. Howard, 1833), 7 Pet. 324, 341,
that a libel in rem in the admiralty might be maintained
against a vessel for repairs done in her home port where a
local statute gave a lien in such a case. To the same
effect, The J. E. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1, 12. As elsewhere
pointed out herein, where a state .statute conferred a lien
operative strictly in rem,At was uniformly held not enforceable in the state courts, but only because it trenched
upon the peculiar jurisdiction of the admiralty, and therefore was not a "common-law remedy" within the. saving
clause of the -Judiciary Act of 1789. The Moses Taylor,
4 Wall. 411, 427, 431; The Hine v.. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555,
571, 572; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644; Steamboat Co. v.
Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533; The Glide, 167 U. S. 606, 623.
Under these decisions, and others to the same effect,
the substance of the matter is that a State may, by statute,
create a right to a lien upon a domestic vessel, in the nature
of a maritime lien, which may be enforced in admiralty
in the courts of the United States; but a State may not
confer upon its own courts jurisdiction to enforce such a
lien, because the federal jurisdiction in admiralty is exclusive. The J. E. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1, 12, and cases
cited. But a lien imposed not upon the rem but upon defendant's interest in the res may be made enforceable in
the state courts. Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine
Co., 237 U. S.303, 307, and cases cited.

against foreign vessels to be enforced in the courts of the
United States.
In the present case there is no question of lien, and, I
repeat, no question concerning the jurisdiction of the state
court; the crucial inquiry is, to what law was it bound to
conform in rendering its decision? Or, rather, the question is the narrower one: Do the Constitution and laws of
the United States prevent a state court of common law
from applying the state statutes in an action in personam
arising upon navigable water within the State, there being
no act of Congress applicable to the controversy? I confess that until this case and kindred cases submitted at the
same time were brought-here, I never had supposed that it
was open to the least doubt that the reservation to suitors
of the right of a common-law remedy had the effect of reserving at the same time the right to have their commonlaw actions determined according to the rules of the common law, or state statutes modifying those rules. This
court repeatedly has so declared, at the same time recognizing fully that the point involves the question of state
power. In United States v, Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 388, the
court; by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, said: "Can the
cession of all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
be construed into a cession of the waters on which those
cases may arise? This is a question on which the court is
incapable of feeling a doubt. The article which describes
the judicial power of the United States is not intended for
the cession of territory, or of general jurisdiction. It is
obviously designed for' other purposes. . . . In
describing the judicial power, the framers of our Constitution had not in view any cession of territory, or, which
is essentially the same, of general jurisdiction. It is not
questioned that whatever may be necessary to the full
and unlimited exercise of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, is in the government of the, Union. Congress may
pass all laws which are necessary and proper for giving

240

244 U. S.

the most complete effect to this power. Still, the general
jurisdiction ovei the place, subject to this grant of power,
adheres to the territory, as a:portion of the sovereignty
not yet given away." In Steamboat Co. v. Chase, supra,
the court, by Mr. Justice Clifford, said (p. 534): "State
statutes, if applicable to the case, constitute the rules of
decision in common-law actions, in the Circuit Courts as
well as in the State courts."
In Atlee v. Packet Co., 21 Wall. 389, 395, 396, the court,
by Mr. Justice Miller, said: "The plaintiff has elected to
bring his suit in an admiralty court, which has jurisdiction
of the case, notwithstanding the concurrent right to
sue at law. In this court the course of proceeding is in
many respects different and the rules of decision are
different. . . . An important difference as regards
this case is the rule for estimating the damages. In the
common-law court the defendant must pay all the damages or none. If there has been on the part of plaintiffs
such carelessness or want of skill as the common law wQuld
esteem to be contributory negligence, they can recover
nothing. By the rule of the admiralty court, where there
has been such contributory negligence, or in other words,
when both have been in fault, the entire damages resulting
from the collision must be equally divided between the
parties. . . . Each court has its own set of rules for
determining these questions, which may be in some respects the same, but in others vary materially." And see
The Max Morris, 137 U. S. 1, 10; Belden v. Chase, 150
U. S. 674, 691; Benedict Adm., § 201.
In the prevailing opinion, great stress is laid upon certain expressions quoted from The Lottawanna, 21 Wall.
558, 574, but it seems to me they have been misunderstood,
because read without regard to context and subject matter.
That was an admiralty appeal, and involved the question
whether by the general maritime law, as accepted in the
United States, there was an implied lien -for necessaries

Prrmy, J., dissenting.

furnished to a vessel in her home port, where no such lien
was recognized by the municipal law of the State. In the
course. of the discussion, the court, by Mr. Justice Bradley,
said: "That we have a maritime law of our own, operative
throughout the United States, cannot be doubted. The
general system of maritime law which was familiar to the
lawyers and statesmen of the country when the Constitution was adopted, was most certainly intended and referred to when it was declared in that instrument that the
judicial power of the United States shall extend 'to all
cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' But by
what criterion are we to ascertain the precise limits of the
law thus adopted? The Constitution does not define it.
It does not declare 'whether it was intended to embrace
the entire maritime law as expounded in the treatises, or
only the limited and restricted system which was received
in England, or lastly, such modification of both of these as
was accepted and recognized as law in this country. Nor
does the Constitution attempt to draw the boundary line between maritime law and local law; nor does it lay down any
critdrion for ascertaining that boundary. It assumes that
the meaning of the phrase 'admiralty and maritime jurisdiction' is well understood. It treats this matter as it does
the cognate ones of common law and equity, when it
speaks of 'cases in law and equity,' or of 'suits at common
law,' without defining those terms, assuming them to be
known and understood."
In this language there is the clearest recognition that
the Constitution, in establishing and distributing the
judicial power, did not intend to define substantive law,
or to make -the rules of decision in one jurisdiction binding
proprio vigore in tribunals exercising another jurisdiction.
The courts of common law were to administer justice
according to the common law, the courts of equity according to the principles of equity, and the courts of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction according to the maritime law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.,
PrrNEY, J., dissenting.

244 U. S.

The expression on page 575 respecting the uniform operation of the maritime law was predicated only of the operation of that law as administered in the courts of admiralty,
for it is not to be believed that there was any purpose to
overrule Atlee v. Packet Co., 21 Wall. 389, 395, decided
at the same term and only about two months before The
Lottawanna by a unanimous court including Mr. Justice
Bradley himself, in which it was held that where there'
was concurrent jurisdiction in the courts of common law
and the courts of admiralty each court was at liberty to
adopt its own rules of decision. Moreover, the principal
question at issue in The Lottawanna was whether the
case of The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438, should be overruled, in which it had been held that, in the absence of
state legislation imposing the lien, a ship was not subject
to a libel in rem in -the admiralty for repairs furnished in
her home port. The general expressions referred to relate
to that state of the law-the absence of state legislation, as
well as of legislation by Congress--and upon this the
decision in The General Smith was upheld (p. 578). But
in proceeding to discuss the subordinate question whether
there was a lien under the state statute, it was held
(p. 579): "It seems to be settled in our jurisprudence that
so long as Congress does not interpose to regulate the
subject, the rights of material-men furnishing necessaries
to a vessel in her home port may be regulated in each State
by State legislation." And again (p. 581): "Whatever
may have been the origin of the practice, and whether or
not it was based on the soundest principles, it became
firmly settled, and it is now too late to question its validity. . . . It would undoubtedly be far more satisfactory to have a uniform law regulating such liens, but until
such a law be adopted (supposing Congress to have the
power) the authority of the States to legislate on the subject seems to be conceded by the uniform course of decisions."

Prrlzy, J., dissenting.

Again, in Workman v. New York City, 179 U. S. 552,
which, like The Lottawanna,was a proceeding in admiralty,
the court, in -quoting the declarations contained in that
case respecting the general operation of the maritime law
throughout the navigable waters of the United States,
was dealing only with its application in the courts of
admiralty. This is plain from what was said as a preface
to the discussion (p. 557): "In examining the first question, that is, whether the local law of New York must prevail, though in conflict with the maritime law, it must be
borne in mind that the issue is not-as was the case in
Detroit v. Osborne (1890), 135 U. S. 492-whether the
local law governs as to a controversy arising in the courts
of common law or of equity of the United States, but does
the local law, if in conflict with the maritime law, control
a court of admiralty of the United States in the administration of maritime rights and duties, although judicial
power with respect to*such subjects has been expressly
conferred by the Constitution (Axt. III, sec. 2) upon the
courts of the United States."
In the argument of the present case and companion
cases, emphasis was laid upon the importance of uniformity in applying and enforcing the rules of admiralty and
maritime law, because of their effect upon interstate and
foreign commerce. This, in my judgment, is a matter to be
determined by Congress. Concurrent jurisdiction and
optional remedies in courts governed by different systems
of law were familiar to the framers of the Constitution,
as they Were to English-speaking peoples generally. The
judicial clause itself plainly contemplated a jurisdiction
concurrent with that of the state courts in other controversies. In such a case, the option of choosing the
jurisdiction is given primarily for the benefit of suitors,
not of defendants. For extending it to defendants, removal proceedings are the appropriate means.
Certainly there is no greater need for uniformity of

adjudication in cases such as the present than in cases
arising on land' and affecting the liability of interstate
carriers to their employees. And, although the Constitution contains an express grant to Congress of the power
to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, nevertheless,
until Congress had acted, the responsibility of interstate
carriers to their employees for injuries arising in interstate
commerce was controlled by the laws of the States. This
was because the subject was within the police power, and
the divergent exercise of that power by the States did not
regulate, but only incidentally affected, commerce among
the States. Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, 103; Second
Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S.1, 54. It required an
act of Congress (Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65)
to impose a uniform measure of responsibility upon the
carriers in such cases. So, it required an act of Congress
(the so-called Carmack Amendment to the Hepburn Act
of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 595) to impose a
uniform rule of liability upon rail carriers for losses of
merchandise carried in interstate commerce. Adams
Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491, 504. In a great
number and variety of cases state laws and policies incidentally affecting interstate carriers in their commercial
operations have been sustained by this court, in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress. Among them
are: Laws requiring locomotive engineers to be examined
and licensed by the state authorities, Smith v. Alabama,
124 U. S.465, 482; requiring such engineers to be examined
for defective eyesight, Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis

U. S. 280; Vandalia R. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission,

of iiterstate carriers. Until now, Congress has passed no
act concerning their responsibility for personal injuries
sustained by passengers or strangers, or for deaths resulting
from such injuries, so that these matters still remain subject to the regulation of the several States. We have held
recently that even the anti-pass provision of the Hepburn
Act (34 Stat. 584, 58,5, c. 3591, § 1) does not deprive a
party who accepts gratuitous carriage in interstate commerce with the consent of the carrier, in actual but unintentional violation of the prohibition of the act, of the
benefit and protection of the law of the State imposing
upon the carrier a duty to care for his safety; Southern

tween two ports located within the same State, Wilmington TransportationCo. v. California Railroad Commission,
236 U. S. 151, 156.

In each of these cases, except the last, which related to
intrastate transport, the state regulation had an incidental
effect upon the very conduct of navigation in interstate or
foreign commerce. If in such cases the States possess the
power of regulation in the absence of inconsistent action
by Congress, much more clearly do they possess that power
where Congress is silent, with respect to a liability which
arises but casually, through the accidental injury or death
of an employee engaged in a maritime occupation.
Indeed, with respect to injuries that result in death, it
already is settled that although the general maritime law,
like the common law, afforded no civil remedy for death
by wrongful act (The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199; The
Alaska, 130 U. S. 201, 209), yet a right of action created
by statute is enforceable in a state court although the
tort was committed upon navigable water (Steamboat Co.
v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533; Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S.
99, 104), and the liability arising out of a state statute in
such a case will be recognized and enforced in the admiralty (The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398), although not by
proceeding in rem unless the statute expressly creates a
lien (The Corsair, 145 U. S. 335, 347).
In Sherlock v. Alling, supra, which was an action in a
state court and based upon a state statute to recover damages for a death by wrongful act occurring in interstate
navigation, it was contended that the statute could not
be applied to cases where the injury was caused by a marine tort, without interfering with the exclusive regulation
of commerce vested in Congress. The court, after declaring that any regulation by Congress, or the liability for its
infringement, would be exclusive of state authority, proceeded to say, by Mr. Justice Field (93 U. S. 104): "But
with reference to a great variety of matters touching the

rights and liabilities of persons engaged in commerce,
either as owners or navigators of vessels, the laws of Congress are silent, and the laws of the State govern. The
rules for the acquisition of property by persons engaged
in navigation, and for its transfer and descent, are, with
some exceptions, those prescribed by the State to which
the vessels belong; and it may be said, generally, that the
legislation of a State, not directed against commerce or
any of its regulations, but relating to the rights, duties,
and liabilities of citizens, and only indirectly and remotely
affecting the operations of commerce, is of obligatory
force upon citizens within its territorial jurisdiction,
whether on land or water, or engaged in commerce, foreign
or interstate, or in any other pursuit. In our judgment,
the statute of Indiana falls under this class. Until Congress, therefore, makes some regulation touching the
liability of parties for marine torts resulting in the death'
of the persons injured, we are of opinion that the statute
of Indiana applies," etc.
I deem The Hamilton, supra, to be a controlling authority upon the question now presented. It was there held,
not only that the constitutional grant of admiralty jurisdiction, followed and construed by the Judiciary Act of
1789, leaves open the common-law jurisdiction of the state
courts over torts committed at sea, but also that it leaves
the States at liberty to change the law respecting such
torts by legislation, as by a statute creating a liability for
death by wrongful act, which was the particular legislation there in question.
To what extent uniformity of decision should result
from the grant of jurisdiction to the courts of the United
States concurrent with that of the state courts, is a subject that repeatedly has been under consideration in this
court, but it never has been held that the jurisdictional
grant required state courts to conform their decisions to
those of the United States courts. The doctrine clearly

SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO. v. JENSEN.
244t.U.S.

PiTNEY, J., dissenting.

deducible from the cases is that in matters of commercial
law and general jurisprudence, not subject to the authority
of Congress or where Congress has not exercised its authority, and in the absence of state legislation, the federal
courts will exercise an independent judgment and reach
a conclusion upon considerations of right and justice
generally applicable, the federal jurisdiction having been
established for the very purpose of avoiding the influence
of local opinion; but that where the State has legislated,
its will thus declared is binding, even upon the federal
courts, if it be not inconsistent with the expressed will of
Congress respecting a matter that is within its constitutional power. The doctrine concedes as much independence to the courts of the States as it reserves for the courts
of the Union. Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S. 20, 33, 34;
East Alabama Ry. Co. v. Doe, 114 U. S.,340, 353; Gibson v.

In Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh, supra, the.
court had under review the judgment of a circuit court of
the United States in an action by a locomotive fireman
injured through negligence of the engineer. The cause of
action arose in the State of Ohio, and the question presented was whether the engineer and fireman were fellowservants. Under the decisions of the Ohio courts they
were, but this court held that, as there was no state statute, the question should not be treated as a question of
local law, to be settled by an examination merely of the
decisions of the state court of last resort, but should be
determined upon general principles; the courts. of the
United States being under an obligation to exercise an
independent judgment. The court, by Mr. Justice
Brewer, said (149 U. S.378): "There is no question as to

the power of the States to legislate and change the rules
of the common law in this respect as in others; but in the
absence of such legislation the question is one determinable
only by the general principles of that law. Further than
that,, it is a question in which the nation as a whole is interested. It enters into the commerce of the country.
Commerce between the States is a matter of national
regulation, and to establish it as such was one of the principal causes which led to the adoption of our Constitution."
In other words, the general effect of the question upon
interstate commerce rendered it one of the class that
called for the application of general principles; nevertheless, state legislation would be controlling-in the absence
of valid legislation by Congress, of course.
In Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Solan,
supra, the doctrine was concisely stated by Mr. Justice
Gray, speaking for the court, as follows (169 U. S. 136):
"The question of the right of a railroad corporation to
contract for exemption from liability for its own negligence
is, indeed, like other questions affecting its liability as a
common carrier of goods or passengers, one of those questions not of merely local law, but of commercial law or general jurisprudence, upon which this court, in the absence
of express statute regulating the subject, will exercise its
own judgment, uncontrolled by the decisions of the courts
of the State in which the cause of action arises. But the
law to be applied is none the less the law of the State; and
may be changed by its legislature, except so far as restrained by the constitution of the State or by the Constitution or laws of the United States."
I freely concede the authority of Congress to modify
the rules of maritime law so far as they are administered
in the federal courts, and to make them binding upon the
courts of the States so far as they affect interstate or international relations, or regulate "commerce with foreign

nations, and among the several States, and with the
Indian tribes." What I contend is that the Constitution
does not, propriovigore, impose the maritime law upon the
States except to the extent that the admiralty jurisdiction
was exclusive of the courts of common law before the
Constitution; that is to say, in the prize jurisdiction, and
the peculiar maritime process in rem; and that as to civil
actions in personam having a maritime origin, the courts
of the States are left free, except as Congress by legislation
passed within its legitimate sphere of action may control
them; and that Congress, so far from enacting legislation
of this character, has from the beginning left the state
courts at liberty to apply their own systems of law in those
cases where prior to the Constitution they had concurrent
jurisdiction with the admiralty, for the saving clause in
the Judiciary Act necessarily has this effect.
Surely it cannot be that the mere grant of judicial power
in admiralty cases, with whatever general authority over
the subject matter can be raised by implication, can, in the
absence of legislation, have a greater effect in limiting the
legislative powers of the States than that which resulted
from the express grant to Congfess of an authority to
regulate interstate commerce,-the limited effect of which,
in the absence of legislation by Congress, we already have
seen. The prevailing opinion properly holds that, under
the circumstances of the case at bar, although plaintiff in
error was engaged in interstate commerce, and the deceased met his death while employed in such commerce,
the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act
(April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65) do not apply, because
they cover only railroad operations and work connected
therewith, whereas the deceased was employed upon an
ocean-going ship. In effect it holds also that in the absence of applicable legislation by Congress the express
grant of authority to regulate such commerce, as contained
in the Constitution, does not exclude the operation of the

state law. It seems to me a curious inconsistency to hold,
at the same time, that the rules of the maritime law exclude the operation of a state statute without action by
Congress, although the Constitution contains no express
grant of authority to establish rules of maritime law, and
the authority must be implied from the mere constitutional grant of judicial power over the subject matter;
and most remarkable that this result is reached in the
face of the fact that the judicial power in cases of admiralty
jurisdiction has been put into effect by Congress subject
to an express reservation of the previous concurrent
jurisdiction of the courts of law over actions of this character. This, besides ignoring the reservation, gives a
greater potency to an implied power than to a power expressly conferred.
The effect of the present decision cannot logically be
confined to cases that arise in interstate or foreign commerce. It seems to be thought that the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States has limits coextensive with
the authority of Congress to regulate commerce. But this
is not true. The civil jurisdiction in admiralty in cases
ex contractu is dependent upon the subject matter; in cases
ex delicto it is dependent upon locality. In cases of the
latter class, if the cause of action arise upon navigable
waters of the United States, even though it be upon a
vessel engaged in commerce wholly intrastate, or upon
one not engaged in commerce at all, or (probably) not
upon any vessel, the maritime courts have jurisdiction.

632; In re Garnett, 141 U. S. 1, 15, 17. It results that if
the constitutional grant of judicial power to the United
States in cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is
held by inference to make the rules of decision that prevail in the courts of admiralty binding proprio vigore upon

state courts exercising a concurrent jurisdiction in cases
of maritime origin, the effect will be to deprive the several
States of their police power over navigable waters lying
wholly within their respective limits, and of their authority
to regulate their intrastate commerce so far as it is carried
upon navigable waters.
The following additional consideration is entitled to
great weight: The same Judiciary Act which in its 9th
section conferred upon the district courts of the United
States original cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the
right of a common-law remedy where the common law
is competent to give it, in its 25th section allowed a writ
of error from this court to review the final judgment or
decree of a state court of last resort resulting from a decision overruling any special claim of right, privilege, or
exemption based upon the construction of any clause of
the Constitution or statutes of the United States. By
later legislation the review was broadened (Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, § 2, 14 Stat. 385, 386; § 709, Rev.
Stats.; § 237, Jud. Code), and by recent legislation the
writ of certiorari has been substituted for the writ of error
in many cases (Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat.
726). But, at all times, the right to review in this court
the decisions of the state courts upon questions of federal
law has existed, so that if by the true construction of Art.
III, § 2, of the Constitution, or of § 9 of the Judiciary Act
of 1789, it had been the right of parties suing or sued in
state courts upon causes of action of a maritime nature
to insist that their cases should be determined according
to the rules of decision found in the law maritime, this
right or immunity might have been asserted as a federal
right, and its denial made the ground of a review of the
resulting judgment, under a writ of error (or, now, a writ
of certiorari), from this court to the state court of last
resort. Yet, until the present case, and others submitted

at the same time, the reported decisions of this court show
not a trace of any such question raised. I can conceive
of no stronger evidence to prove that from the foundation
of the government until the present time it has been the
opinion of the Bar and of the Judiciary, in the state courts
as well as in the courts of the United States, that it was
not the right of parties suing or sued in state courts of law
or equity upon causes of action arising out of maritime
affairs, to have them decided according to the principles
that would have controlled the decision had the suits been
brought in the admiralty courts.
There is no doubt that, throughout the entire life of the
nation under the Constitution, state courts not only have
exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of admiralty in actions ex contractu arising out of maritime
transactions, and in actions ex delicto arising upon the
navigable waters, but that in exercising such jurisdiction
they have, without challenge until now, adopted as rules
of decision -their local laws and statutes, recognizing no
obligation of a federal nature to apply the law maritime.
State courts of last resort, in several recent cases, have
had occasion to consider the precise contention now made
by plaintiff in error, and upon full consideration have rejected it. Lindstrom v. Mutual Steamship Co., 132 Minnesota, 328; North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Industrial Accident
Commission [Cal.], 163 Pac. Rep. 199; Kennerson v.
Thames Towboat Co., 89 Connecticut, 367, 373. See also
Matter of Walker v. Clyde Steamship Co., 215 N. Y. 529,
531; Matter of Jensen v. Southern Pacific Co., 215 N. Y.
514 (this case). I have found no case to the contrary except a decision by the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio in Schuede v. Zenith S. S. Co.,
216 Fed. Rep. 566, now under consideration by this court.
The reasoning is unsatisfactory, and it was repudiated in
Keithley v. North Pacific S. S. Co., 232 Fed. Rep. 255, 259.
I may remark, in closing, that there is no conflict be-

tween the New York Workmen's Compensation Act and
the acts of Congress for limiting the liability of shipowners (Rev. Stats., §§ 4283-5; Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,
§ 18, 23 Stat. 53, 57). So long as the aggregate liabilities
of the owner, including that under the New York law,
do not amount to as much as the interest of the owner
in the vessel and freight pending, the act of Congress does
not come into play. Where it does apply, it reduces all
liabilities proportionally, under whatever law arising;

the liability under the New York law along with the others.
