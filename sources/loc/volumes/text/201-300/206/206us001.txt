ATLANTIC COAST LINE RAILROAD COMPANY v. NORTH
CAROLINA CORPORATION COMMISSION.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA.
No. 15.

Argued February 28 and March 1, 1907.-Decided April 29, 1907.

Railroad companies from the public nature of the business by them carried
on, and the interest which the public have in their operation are subject
as to their state business to state regulation, which may be exerted either
directly by the legislative authority or by administrative bodies endowed
with power to that end.
The public power to regulate railroads and the private right of ownership
of such property coexist and do not the one destroy the other; and where
the power to regulate is so arbitrarily exercised as to infringe the rights
of ownership the exertion is void because repugnant to the due process
and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
An order of a state railroad commission requiring a railroad company to
so arrange its schedule as to furnish transportation between two points
so as to make connections with through trains, held, under the circumstances of this case, not to be so arbitrary or unreasonable as to transcend
the limits of regulation and to be in effect either a denial of due process
of law or a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws, or a taking
of property without compensation.
Whether a regulation of a state railroad commission otherwise legal is
arbitrary and unreasonable because beyond the scope of the powers
delegated to the commission is not a Federal question.
It is within the power of a state railroad commission to compel a railroad
company to make reasonable connections with other roads -so as to proVOL. CCVf-lI

mote the convenience of the traveling public, and an order requiring the
running of an additional train for that purpose, if otherwise just and
reasonable, is not inherently unjust and unreasonable because the run-.
ning of such train will impose some pecuniary loss on the company.
While the enforcement by a Ste
of a general scheme of maximum rates
so unreasonably low as to be unjust and unreasonable may be confiscation and amount to taking property without due process of law, the
State has power to compel a railroad company to perform a particular
and specified duty necessary for the convenience of the public even
though it may entail some pecuniary loss. Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.
526, distinguished.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John G. Johnson, with whom Mr. Warren G. Elliott and
Mr. Frank P. Prichardwere on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
A State cannot require a railroad company to run a special
daily train at a lbss for the convenience of a limited number of
passengers who wish to make. close connection with a particular train on a crossing road, it appearing that it is already
running _sufficient trains to accommodate the general travel
on its lines and has arranged its schedules to best accommodate
general travel and connect with all connecting roads, and that
its failure to connect with such particular train was due to a
change of. schedule on the crossing road to which it was impracticable to conform by any change in the schedule of the
train which had made the. connection under the original
schedule.
As to the power of the State to regulate railroads and the
constitutional limitations upon the exercise of such power
and as to what are unreasonable regulations, see Wisconsin, &c.
R. R. Co. v. Jacobson, 179 U. S. 287; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.

M. & St. P. Ry. v. Tompkins, 176 U. S. 167.
A statute which in effect applied to one corporation only and
not to others in like business was- unreasonable. Every partial
or private law which directly proposes to destroy or affect

individual rights or does the .sarre thing by affording remedies
leading to similar consequences, is unconstitutional and void.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., 183 U. S. 79; Lake
Shore & Mich. Southern v. Smith, 173 U. S.684.
In the case at bar the order complained of was not an exercise of the police power of the State. It was not made to protect the health, the morals, or the safety, of the citizens. It,
was the exercise of a governmental power to regulate, for public
convinieiice, the facilities afforded to the public by a corporation. See Minneapolis & St. L. R. R. v. Minnesota, 186 U. S.
.257. An order which is reasonable, when necessary for the
protection of the lives or health of the public, may be very
unreasonable if ihade simply for public convenience.
The order in the present case was a very unusual one.
None of the authorities cited by the court, or counsel. in the
court below, show any attem-pt by a state legislature, or a
commission, fo increase the number of trains on a railroad.
People v. St. L., A. & T. H. R. R. Co., 176 Illinois, 512, distinguished, and see Ohio & Miss. Ry. v. People, 120 Illinois,
200.
No case has held that, in the absence of statutory requirements, a -railway company may, be, compelled by mandamus
to increase the number of trains on its road or to run daily
a particular number:of trains, over its road,, and there is no
common law authority for making such an order.
As to general regulations prescribing a minimum number
of daily trains, see Lake Shore & Mich. South. v. Ohio, 173
U. S. 285.
The cases show no attempted exercise by any State, or commission, of a power to order. a particular railroad to put. on an
additional train between certain poiits for the sake of affording additional convenience of transportatin. Such a power
would- partake more of the nature 'of an -operation of such
particular road than- of! a general regulation of all roads for
the public convenience.
In this case the order compelled the railroad to run an additional train at a pecuniary loss.
This is the appropriation of property without compensation.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

206 U. S.

There can be no just distinction between taking possession of
and using a company's property at its expense and forcing
the company to use the property for the benefit of the public
at a loss to itself. Chiwago, Mil. &c. Ry. v. Tompkins, 176
U. S. 167-173.
Conceding that it is within the power of the legislature to
compel this particular railroad to run this particular additional train over its road, to meet some special public need,
it is, certainly not within the power of the legislature to compel
the railroad to do it for nothing, much less to do it at a loss.
Even if the legislature had the power to direct the running
of a special additional train at a loss in order that a comparatively few passengers from a branch line might make convenient
connection with a particular train over another road, the order.
itself was under the circumstances 'so unreasonable 4hat. it
must be considered an unwarrantable interfere nce with the
property rights .of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which was
running a sufficient number of trains for all necessary purposes.
There could not have been a more unreasonable and unjustifiable interference with its affairs. It is no answer to this to
say that the jury found it was "reasonable, and proper that
for the convenience of the traveling public" the connection
should be made. The other facts found by the jury, coupled
with the omission of either finding or testimony justifying the
order, make the question one for the court. The finding resulted from a failure properly to instruct the jury as to the
duty and rights of the appellant. It is for the court to say
what is the nature of the convenience which justifies such an
order and how far, for such convenience, the legislature or
commission can interfere with the reasonable exercise by the
railroad of its right to operate its own road.
Mr. Robert D. Gilmer, Attorney General of the State of North
Carolina, and Mr. F. A. Woodard, for defendant in error:
The North Carolina Corporation Commission found as a fact
that its order could be carried into effect by the extension of

either the Spring Hope or the Plymouth run, and this finding
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
The highest court of the State having therefore decided
against the plaintiff in error upon an independent ground, not
involving a Federal question, and broad enough to maintain
the judgment, the judgment of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina should be affirmed or the writ of error dismissed without considering the Federal question, assuming that one is
presented in the record. Kennebec & P. R. Co. v. Portland

The presumption of law is always in favor of the maintenance
of the order of a railroad commission, and the same will not be
set aside unless flagrantly in violation of the rights of the railroad company. Dow v. Beidleman, 125 U. S. 680; Reagan

The public safety, interest and convenience are clearly
embraced within the legislative power of the State, and the
exercise of this power does not deprive the plaintiff in error
of its property without due process of law under the constitution of North Carolina or of the United States. Brass v. North

MR.

JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

Did the order of the North Carolina Corporation Commission,
the enforcement of which was directed by the court below,
invade ionstitutional rights of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad
Company, hereafter spoken of as the Coast Line, is the question
which arises on this record for decision. A sketch showing
the situation of the railway tracks at and relating to the place
with which the controversy is concerned was annexed by the
court below to its opinion, and that sketch is reproduced to
aid in clearness of statement.
For. years prior to October, 1903, the Coast Line operated
daily an interstate train from Richmond, Virginia, through
North Carolina to Florida. This train, known as No. 39,
moved over the main track from Richmond to Wilson, North
Carolina,, thence by the track designated as -the cut-off via
Selma and Fayetteville to Florida. The train .(No. 39) was
scheduled to reach Selma at 2:50 in the afternoon and to leave
at 2:55. The Southern Railway owned or controlled a road
in North Carolina which crossed the Coast Line main track at
Goldsboro and the cut-off track at Selma. On this road there
was operated daily a train from Goldsboro via Raleigh to
Greensboro, North Carolina, at which point connection was
made with the min track of the Southern road. This Southern

206 U. S.

train, known as No. 135, left Goldsboro at 2: 05 in the afternoon
and Selma at 3 o'clock. Thus at Selma it connected with No.
39 of the Coast Line. The Coast Line also operated in North
Carolina the branch lines shown on the sketch, which radiated
easterly, and served a considerable area of territory. These
branches connected with the main track at Rocky Mount, a
station forty-two miles hearer Richmond than Selma. At
Rocky Mount there also was a connection with a Coast Line
road running from Pinners Point, near Norfolk, Virginia.
Over this road also the Coast Line operated a train, which left
Pinners Point in the morning and connected with the Coast
Line train "No39 at Rocky Mount.' The departure of the train
in question from Pinners Point was so arranged as to enable
boats timed to arrive at Norfolk during the night or early
morning to make, by ferry to Pinners Point, a morning connection with the train. On the third of October, 1903, the Southern
Railway notified the North Carolina Corporation Commission
of a contemplated change of schedule on its line from Goldsboro
via Raleigh to Greensboro. By the change, which was to go
into effect on the 11th of October, Southern train No. 135,
instead of leaving Goldsboro at 2:05, would leave at 1:35 in
the afternoon, and would leave'Selma at 2:25 instead of 3.
As a result, the connection at Selma between the Coast Line
train No 39 and the Southern train would be broken. 4Th
North Carolina Corporation Commission, by letter, on the sixth
of October, called the attention of the general manager of the
Coast Line to the contemplated change of time by the Southern,
and requested that line to advance the time of No. 39 to enable
that train to reach Selma at 2:25, thus continuing the connection with the Southern. On the twelfth of October the superintendent of transportation of the Coast Line answered. He
stated that the schedule of train No. 39 from Richmond to
Selma was already so fast that it was very difficult to make
the connection at Selma, and that it would be impossible to
advance the time of arrival at Selma as requested. It was
besides represented that to d6 so would require a breakirig of

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N.

Opinion of the Court.

the connection made with the Norfolk train at Rocky Mount
and would disarrange the running time of the train south of
Selma and disturb connections which that train made with
other roads south of. that point. However, it was pointed out
that as train No.39 did not originate at Richmond, but was a
through train made up at New York, carried from thence to
Washington by the Pennsylvania and from Washington to
Richmond by the Richmond; Fredericksburg and Potomac,
that negotiations. would be put on foot with those roads with
an endeavor to secure an acceleration of the time of the departure of the train from New York and Washington, so as
thereby to enable an earlier'departure from Richmond.

On

the eleventh of October the change of time became operative
and the connection at Selma was broken-.
A complaint having been lodged with- the corporation commission because. of the inconvenience to the public thereby
occasioned, both- tbe Southern and Coast Line were notified
-that a hearing.,iQW1 be had concerning the subject on the
29th. On that day the railways, -through their officials,
appeared. The Southern represented, that its -change in time
was because it was absolutely dangerous to operate its train
at the speed reqiuired by the previous schedule, and indeed
that the lengthened schedule was yet faster than..desired.
The Coast Line reiterated the impossibility of changing the
schedule of train No. 39 from Richmond to Selma unless there
was a change between New York and Richmond. It stated
that there was to be a meeting in Washington on November 6
of the representatives of various roads in the South, and that
it hoped, as the result of that meeting, to so arrange that No.
39 would be scheduled for delivery at Richmond at an earlier
hour, thus enabling its time to Selma to be advanced. The
commission continued the subject for further consideration.
On November 9 the superintendent of the Coast Line advised
the corpbration commission that at the meeting in Washington
it.
had been impossible to"obtain an earlier departure of the
train from New York and Washington, bpt that the Pennsyl-

vania still had the matter under consideration. Finally, in
answer to urgent requests from the commission, by a letter of
November 13 and telegram of November 14 the Coast Line
informed the corporation commission that it regretted it could
make no change in-its schedule of train No. 39 because the
Pennsylvania Railroad had definitively expressed its inability
to make any change in the hour of departure of the train from
New York, as to do so would be incompatible with the duties
which the Pennsylvania Railroad owed to the public, to other
roads and to its contracts concerning the transportation of the
mail and express matter. Thereupon the corporation commission entered the following order:
"Whereas, the convenience of the traveling public requires
that close connection be made between the passenger trains
on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Southern Railway
at Selma daily in the afternoon of each day;
"And whereas, it appears that such close connection is
practicable:
"It is ordered that the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad arrange
its schedule so that the train will arrive at Selma at 2:25 P.M.
each day instead of: 2:50 P. M., as the schedule now stands.
"It is further ordered that if the Atlantic Coast Line trains
have. passengers en route for the Southern Railway, and are
delayed, notice shall be given to the Southern Railway, and
that the Southern Railway shall wait fifteen minutes for such
delayed trains upon receipt of such notice.
'iThis order shall take effect December 20, 1903."
The Southern, on receipt of the order, expressed its intention
to comply. The Coast Line addressed to the commission a
letter protesting against the' oder and requesting its withdrawal
and asking for a further hearing. The letter making this request reviewed the previous correspondence. It pointed out
that the connection at Selma had been a very old one and that
-its breaking was solely caused by the act of the Southern in
changing the time of its train. It declared that the Coast Line
at once, on hearing of the intention of the Southern to make

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 11

Opinion of the Court.

the change, urgently requested that road not to do so. On
this subject the letter said:
"On October 6th, I further advised the Southern Railway
that if their train was scheduled to leave Selma at two twentyfive P. M.this would break the connection with our No. 39, and
stated to them that the connection was a most important one,
being the principal outlet for passengers en route from eastern
Carolina to Raleigh and other'points on their line, and that we
hoped that they. could see their way clear not to disturb the
connection, as it was impossible for us to get No. 39 to Selma
at an earlier hour than the present schedule, owing to the inability of northern connections to deliver the train to us at
Richmond any sooner."
Proceeding to point out the failure of the negotiations with
the Pennsylvania and recapitulating the previous statements
concerning the rapidity of the schedule of No. 39 between
Richmond and Selma, the exacting nature of its work and connections, the absplute'impossibility of making it faster was insisted upon. Indeed, there was annexed to the letter a report
of the time of No. 39 at Selma for a period of nearly five months,
showing that the train had rarely made its connection at Selma.
• The commission, after a hearing afforded officials of the Coast
Line, suspended its prior order and fixed a day for a rehearing
of the whole subject, both roads being notified to that effect.
Upon the new hearing the matter was taken under advisement.
On January 16 the commission stated the facts and its conclusions deduced therefrom. As to the operation of the two trains,
their connection at Selma, the importance of this connection
to the public and the 'breaking of the connection by the change
of schedule, the facts found were identical with those above
previously recited. In addition. it was found that the Coast
Line train No. 39 from Richmond to Selma was not only a
through train, but also operated as a local train between Richmond and Selma, making all local stops and daily handling in
consequence one or two extra express cars. It was found in
accordance with the official time sheets of the running of the

train that it had arrived at Selma on schedule time only twice
between August 1, 1903, and January 11, 1904. Considering
the branch lines as marked on the sketch and the trains operated thereon and connecting with the main track at Rocky
Mount it was found:
a. T hat a train was operated from Plymouth to Rocky Mount
which left in the morning at 7:30 and arrived at Rocky Mount
at 10:35, whee it remained until 3:55 in the afternoon, when
it returned to Plymouth.
b. That the road also operated a train. from Spring Hope on
the westerly side of the main track to Rocky Mount, leaving
Spring Hope at 11:20 in the morning, arriving at Rocky Mount
at 12:10 in the afternoon and leaving there at 4, arriving at
Spring Hope at 4:45. The commission concluded as follows:
"Assuming that the statements made by the Atlantic Coast
Line Railroad Company are true-that it was for the past five
months impossible for them to bring No. 39 to Selma by schedule time, to wit, 2:50 P. M., more than twice, and that this train
was more'than ten minutes late every day except twenty-four
-we must conclude that it is impracticable to require them
to make a faster schedule and place this train at Selma at 2:25
P. M. instead of 2:50 P. m.; and therefore this much of the
former order is revoked and annulled; but the commission is of
the opinion that it is practicable and that the convenience of
the traveling public requires that the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad C6mpany furnish transportation for passengers from
Rocky Mount to Selma after 12:50 P. M.and by or before 2:25
P. M. each day; that this can be done by extending the run of
the Plymouth train to Selma instead of having it lie over at
Rocky Mount as now, or by extending the run of the Spring
Hope train to Selma instead of having it lie over at Rocky
Mount as now. The distance from Plymouth to Rocky Mount
is sixty-nine miles, and from Spring Hope to Rocky Mount
is nineteen miles, and from Rocky Mount to Selma forty-two
miles; or by providing a separate train for the service.
"And it is therefore ordered that the Atlantic Coast Line

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 13
206 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Railroad Company furnish transportation for passengers from
RockyMount to Selma after 12:50 P. M. and by or before 2:25
P. M. each day.
"It is further ordered that the Southern Railway hold its
train No. 135 at Selma fifteen minutes if for any reason the
Atlantic Coast Line train connecting at that point is delayed.
"It is further ordered that this order take effect on and after
the 26th day of January, 1904."
Before the date fixed for the taking effect of this order the
Coast Line filed five grounds of exception to its validity and
prayed another hearing. The first asserted the impossibility
of making the connection from Rocky Mount to Selma between
the hours fixed by the commission by an extension of the run
of either of the branch trains referred to in the order which the
commission had rendered. The reasons principally relied upon
to sustain the first exception were the inadequate character
of the motive power of the branch road trains for operation
on the main track, the speed at which the train would be obliged
to travel and the congested condition of the business on the
main track during the hours when the train from either of
the branch roads would be obliged to use the main track for
the purpose of making the connection. The second exception
denied the possibility of making the connection by a special
train from Rocky Mount to Selma within the time indicated,
and besides asserted that such a train could not be operated
without an actual loss. The power of the commission to compel
the performance of "services without compensation to the
company" was denied, and it was alleged that a taking of
property without due process of law in violation of the state
constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States would result from enforcing the order.
The third exception denied the power of the commission under
the state law to order -the company to put on an extra train
between Rocky Mount and Selma, and the fourth in effect reiterated the same ground. The fifth exception challenged the
validity of the order as unreasonable, unjust and arbitrary and

beyond the power of the commission to render, because ample
and sufficient accommodations for passengers desiring to connect at Selma with the Southern road were afforded by the Coast
Line entirely irrespective of the connection which had formerly
existed between train No. 39 of the Coast Line and train No.
135 of the Southern. The trains thus relied upon as showing
a wholly adequate service for the purposes stated were eight
in .number, and, as enumerated in the exception, are stated
in the margin.'
After a new hearing at which further testimony was taken,
the corporation commission in substance adhered to its former
view and reiterated its previous ruling. In its findings of fact
it pointed out the importance of the connection at Selma, the
admissions to that effect made by the railroad and the fact that
1 1. The train from Rocky Mount, southbound, in the early morning,
makes a close connection at Goldsboro at 6:50 o'clock with the Southern
for Raleigh and all points West.
2. The trains from Norfolk and Richmond make close connection at
Goldsboro and Selma with the night train on the Southern for Raleigh and
all points West.
3. The train from Weidon to Kinston makes close connection at Kinston
with the Atlantic and North Carolina train for Goldsboro, which train in
turn makes close connection with the Southern at Goldsboro at 9:40 P. M.
for Raleigh and all points West.
4. The train No. 39, from Washington to Jacksonville, is due at Selma
at 2:50 P. M., and the accommodation train No. 183, on the Southern,
from Selma to Releigh and all points West, is scheduled to leave Selma at
3:25 P. M.
5. Train No. -,. from Jacksonville to Washington, is due to arrive at
Selma at 2:10 o'clock, and makes close connection there with the Southern,
which leaves Selma at 2:25 P. M. for Raleigh and all points West.
6. Two trains leave Wilmington for the North, the first at 9:30 A. M.,
No. 48, and the other, No. 42, at 6:50 P. m. Both of these trains make close
connections at Goldsboro with the Southern trains for Raleigh and all points
West.
7. No. 34, leaving Smithfield at 7:00 A. M., makes close connection at
Selma with the Southern going West for Raleigh and all points beyond,
and the same train makes close connection at Weldon with the Seaboard
train for Raleigh, and for Seaboard points South and West.
8. No. 102 leaves Goldsboro for Norfolk at 7:30 A. M., and makes close
connection at Hobgood with No. 58, the train from Kinston to Weldon,
and there with the Seaboard for Raleigh and points West.

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 15

Opinion of the Court.

that connection afforded the principal means of travel between
the eastern and western parts of the State. The grounds relied upon in the exception to show that an extension of the
run of either of the local trains from Rocky Mount to Selma
as previously ordered was impracticable, were reviewed and
found to be without foundation. The trains which it was
alleged afforded adequate means for connection between the
western and eastern part of the State, irrespective of the connection formerly existing at Selma by train No. 39, were analyzed, and as a matter of fact the service afforded by these
trains was held to be wholly inadequate. Thus, for example,
whilst it was found that the first train relied upon-the one
from Rocky Mount to Goldsboro, arriving there at 6:50 in the
m6rning--made a connection with a Southern Railway train
moving from Selma via Raleigi to Greensboro, it was pointed
out that it was inadequate because the train had no connection
at its .point of departure, Rocky Mount, with any incoming
train over the large area covered by the branch roads, which
area, it was stated; embraced a population of four hundred
thousand people. Hence it was found that to use that train
any person in the territory covered by the branch roads would
be obliged to leave home the day before and pass the night at
Rocky Mount. The fourth train relied upon, that is, a connection made by Coast Line No. 39 at Selma under the new
schedule with a later train over the Southern road for Raleigh,
was found to be but a connection with a Southern freight train,
having no passenger car, but only a caboose. The trains under
the second, third and sixth headings, connecting at Goldsboro
or Selma in the afternoon and night, were found to make a
connection only with a slow train over the Southern road,
doing a mixed passenger and freight business, and which made
no adequate. connection :beyond Raleigh to the west. The
objection to suggested route No. 8, that is; via-Weldon, and.
thence by the Seaboard Air Line to Raleigh and points further
west, was decided to.be that it was a longer route, more costly,
and uncertain as to connections. The remaining suggested

routes were in effect disposed of upon similar considerations
to those above adverted to.
Considering the operation of an extra train from Rocky
Mount to Selma or the extension of the run of one of the branch
trains as directed in the previous order, and the objection that
a loss would be entailed in the operating expenses for such
train or trains, the commission treated that fact as immaterial,
because it found as a matter of fact that the total receipts of
the Coast Line in North Carolina, taken from business in that
State, were sufficiently remunerative, and therefore that even
if the train was operated at a los, as that loss would not reduce
the total earnings below what was an adequate remuneration
for the whole business, the Qrder would not take the property
of the road without due process of law. Summing up its conclusions, the commission said:'
"The commission is of the opinion 'that the facilities given
heretofore by the Atlantic Coast Line Company to the traveling
public should not be lessened; that the connection furnished
passenger from the Washington branch, the Norfolk and
Carolina branch, the Plymouth branch and the Nashville
branch with No. 135, Southern Railway passenger train at
Selma, and also for all points between Rocky Mount and Selma,
for nearly ten years, should be restored; that if this cannot be
done by the Atlantic Coast Line 'train No. 39, as formerly, on
account of this train being heavier, containing usually one or
more extra" express cars, and in all usually ten or more cars,
and on account of increase in business between Richmond and
Selma, which necessitates longer stops, then other facilities
should be furnished by the Atlantic Coast Line Company; that
this connection, which was the principal outlet for passengers
from eastern Carolina to Selma and other Southern Railway
points for the last ten years, instead of being abandoned should
be made permanent and certain, and that this result be accoinplished by carrying out -the order heretofore made in this court.
It is ordered, therefore, that the exceptions be, aid they are
hereby, overruled."

Opinion of the Court.

The Coast Line, as authorized by statute, appealed to the
Superior Court of Wake County, city of Raleigh, and the case
was there tried de novo before a court and jury. The jury,
under the instructions of the court, considered and responded
to the eight questions, which follow:
"1. Is it practicable for train No. 39 of the Atlantic Coast
Line Railroad, due to arrive at Selma at 2:50 P.M., to make
connection at Selma with train No. 135, westbound, of the
Southern Railway, due to leave Selma at 2:25 e.M.?
"Answer. No.
"2. Is it practicable to make said connection by extending
the run of the Plymouth train daily from Plymouth to Selma
and return, and if so, what would be the additional expense?
"Answer. No.
"3. Is it practicable to make said connection by the use
of the Spring Hope train, and if so, what would be the additional expense?
"Answer. No.
"4. In order to make such connection would defendant
company have to run an additional train on-its main line
from Rocky Mount to Selma?
"Answer. Yes.
"5. Is it practicable for said train to safely run the schedule
prescribed in plaintiff's order, having due regard to the number of trains and number of stops, on defendant's main line
from Rocky Mount to Selma?
"Answei.
Yes.
"6. What would be the daily cost of operating such train
from Rocky Mount to Selma and return?
"Answer: $40.00.
"7. What would be the probable daily receipts from such
train?
"Answer. $25.00.
"8. Is it reasonable and proper that, for convenience of the
traveling public, the defendant company should be required
to make such connection?

"Answer. Yes."
The answers to the first four questions were the result of
peremptory instructions by the court, and the responses to
the last four were deduced by the jury from the testimony
submitted to its consideration.
The court granted the prayer of the Atlantic Coast Line to
that effect and rendered judgment on the verdict in its favor.
The corporation commission was held to be without power
"to interfere with the right of railway companies to regulate
for themselves the time and manner in which passengers and
property should be transported," provided only such companies complied with the existing statutory direction "to run
one passenger train at least each way over its line every week
day." On appeal the Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the judgment. The facts found by the corporation
commission were reiterated, and it was held that error had
been committed by the court below in instructing the jury
to give a negative response to the first three propositions.
Indeed it was declared that the only essential proposition
submitted to the jury was the eighth, which required it to be
determined whether the connection at Selma was necessary
for the public convenience. Treating the facts found by the
commission as sustaining the conclusion reached by that body,
it was decided that the commission had power to make the
order, and that the exercise of the authority was not repugnant
either to the Constitution of the United States or of the State.
Notwithstanding the finding of facts made concerning the
means by which the connection at Selma was to be performed,
-the court construed the order of the commission as not having
been solely based upon the ineans of performance referred to
in the findings and as embracing not only a choice of the
methods referred to therein, but any other which the Coast
Line might choQse to adopt, provided only it accomplished
the purpose of the order. But whilst thus from one point
of:view, treating the order of the coihmission so as to render
it unnecessary to -pass upon the particular methods for mak-

Opinion of the Court.

ing the connection at Selma referred to in the findings, the
court yet reviewed the means of performance therein stated.
In doing so it was decided that although to execute the order
of the commission it might be imperative for the Coast Line
to operate at a pecuniary loss a new train from Rocky Mount
to Selma, or the extension with like result of the movement
of one or the other of the branch trains from Rocky Mount
to Selma, no violation of any right of the Coast Line protected
by the Constitution of the United States or of the State would
arise. This was based upon the finding by the court that the
average net earning of the railroad from its business in North
Carolina was of such a character that an adequate remuneration would remain after allowihg for any possible loss which
might arise from operating either of the trains in question.

All the assignments of error challenge the correctness of the
decision below on the ground of its repugnancy to the due
process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The elementary proposition that railroads from the
public nature of the business by them carried on and the interest which the public have in their operation are subject,
as to their state business, to state regulation, which may be
exerted either directly by the legislative authority or by
administrative bodies endowed with power to that end, is not
and could riot be successfully questioned in view of the long
line of authorities sustaining that doctrine.' Accepting this

general rule, the assignments of error rest upon the. hypothesis
that the order which the court below enforced tas so arbitrary
and unreasonable in its character as to transcend the limits
of regulation and to be in effect a denial of due process of law
or a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws.
As the public power to regulate railways and the private
right of ownership of such property coexist and do not the one
destroy the other, it has been settled that the right of ownership of railway property like other property rights finds protection in constitutional guarantees, and, therefore, wherever
the power of regulation is exerted in such an arbitrary and unreasonable way as to cause it to be in effect not a regulation
but an infringement upon the right of ownership, such an
exertion of power is void because repugnant to the due process
and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.'
The result, therefore, is that the proposition relied upon is well
founded if it be that the order which the court below enforced
was of the arbitrary and unreasonable character asserted.
In coming to consider the question just stated it must be
borne in mind that a court may not, under the guise of protecting private property, extend its authority to a subject of
regulation not within its competency, but is confined to ascertaining whether the particular assertion of the legislative
power to regulate has been exercised to so unwarranted a
degree as in substance and effect to exceed regulation, and be
equivalent to a taking of property without due process of law,
or a denial of the equal protection of the laws. We shall not

Opinion of the Court.

ten propositions of error found in the record and reproduced
in the briefs of counsel, as each proposition, although numbered separately, but reiterate grounds of error to be found
in the others. In other words, the various grounds of error
are so interblended in the several propositions as to render
it impossible to treat one as distinct from the other. All the
grounds, however, which the propositions assert as 'establishing the arbitrary and unreasonable character of the order
complained of may be embraced under four general headings,
which we proceed to dispose of.
1. That the order was arbitrary and unreasonable, because
beyond the scope of the authority delegated to the corporation
commission by the state law.
As this proposition involves no Federal question and is
concluded by the judgment entered below, we put the subject
out of view. And, although not cognate to this proposition,
to clear the way for the consideration of the substantial issues
we also put aside the suggestion made in argument that as
the Southern Railway by its change of schedule originally
rendered the connection at Selma impossible, therefore that
road should have been compelled to restore the connection
by a modification of the schedule or schedules of the trains by
it operated. We put this suggestion aside because it does
not seem to have been seriously urged in the court below, and
besides is so directly refuted by the findings that we think
it requires no further notice.
2. The order was arbitrary and unreasonable, because when
properly considered it imposed upon the Coast Line a duty
foreign to its obligation to furnish adequate facilities for those
traveling upon its road.
This rests upon the assumption that as the order was based
not upon the neglect of the Coast Line to afford facilities for
travel over its own road, but because of the failure to furnish
facilities to those traveling on the Coast Line who desired
also to connect with and travel on the Southern road, therefore the order was in no just sense a regulation of the business

206 U. S.

of the Coast Line. This reduces itself to the contention that,
although the governmental power to regulate exists in the
interest of the public, yet it does not extend to securing to the
public reasonable facilities for making connection between
different carriers. But the propositiori destroys itself, since
at one and the same time it admits the plenary power to regulate and yet virtually denies the efficiency of that authority.
That power, as we have seen, takes its origin from the quasi.public nature of the business in which the carrier is engaged,
and embraces that business in its entirety, which of course
includes the duty to require carriers to make reasonable connections with other roads, so as to promote the convenience
of the traveling public. In considering the facts found below
as to the connection in question, that is, the population contained in the large territory whose convenience was subserved
by the connection, and the admission of the railroad as to the
importance of the connection, we conclude that the order in
question, considered from the point of view of the requirements of the public interest, was one coming clearly within
the scope of the power to enforce just and reasonable regulations.
3. That the facilities afforded the public by the railroadwere
of such a character as to demonstrate that the extra burden which
would result from the compliance with the order was wholly
arbitraryand unreasonable.
This rests upon the assumption that as there were several
existing daily connections between trains of the Coast Line
and those of the Southern at Selma, which might be availed
of by those desiring to travel from eastern to western North
Carolina and beyond, and, as besides, the proof established
that another connection operating the same result was afforded
by way of Weldon and the Seaboard Air Line to Raleigh and
thence further west, therefore it was both arbitrary and unreasonable to superadd an unnecessary connection. Conceding, as must be done, that the nature and extent of the existing
facilities furnished by a carrier for the public convenience are

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 23
206 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

essential to be considered in determining whether an order
directing an increase of such facilities is just and reasonable,
and that the deficiency of facilities must clearly appear to
justify an order directing the furnishing of new and additional
facilities, we think the proposition here relied on to be without
merit. Its error arises from assuming that adequate facilities
were afforded at Selma or via Weldon and the Seaboard without reference to the order complained of. In view of the facts
as to the connections at Selma and the Weldon rout6 found
by the commission and reiterated by the court, which we have
previously stated and which we accept, we cannot escape
drawing for ourselves the conclusion deduced both by the
commission and the court below that the connections relied
on were wholly inadequate for the public convenience, and,
therefore, a state of things existed justifying the order.
4. That, however otherwise just and reasonable the order may
have been, it is inherently unjust and unreasonable because of
the nature of the burden which it necessarily imposes.
This proposition is based on the hypothesis that the order,
by necessary intendment, directed the Coast Line to operate
an additional train, although such train could not be operated
without a daily pecuniary loss. The premise upon which
this proposition rests would seem to be irrelevant, since the
court below in one aspect of its opinion treated the order of
the commission as not requiring the operation of an extra
train from Rocky Mount to Selma. Yet, as the facts found by
the commission and which were affirmed by the court would
indicate that it was considered that the operation of such
train was the most direct and efficient means for making the
ordered connection, and as the court considered and passedupon the duty of the railroad to comply with the order, even
if to do so it became necessary to operate the extra train at a
loss,:we think the proposition relied upon is open and must
be decided. The contention is that the fact that some loss
would result from the requirement that the extra train be
operated, in and of itself, conclusively establishes the unrea-

208 U. S.

sonableness of the order and demonstrates that to give it
effect would constitute a taking of property without due
process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Conclusive support for this contention, it is insisted, is afforded
by the doctrine upheld in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, and
the cases which preceded that decision. The cases relied upon,
however, only involved whether a general scheme of maximum
rates imposed by state authority prevented the railroads from
earning a reasonable compensation, taking into view all proper
considerations as to the value of the property and the cost of
operation, and, if not, whether the enforcement of rates so
unreasonably low would be unjust and unreasonable, and,
therefore, be confiscation, that is, a taking of property without
due process of law in violation of the Constitution of the United
States. The principle upon which the cases in question proceeded was thus summed up by Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering
the opinion of the court in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 526:
"A state enactment or regulations made under the authority
of a state enactment, establishing rates for the transportation
of persons or property by railroad that will not admit of the
carrier earning such compensation, as under all the circumstances is just to it and to the public, would deprive such carrier
of its property without due process of law and deny to it the
equal protection of the laws, and would, therefore, be repugnant to -the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States."
But this case does not involve the enforcement by a State
of a general scheme of maximum rat~s, but only whether an
exercise of. state authority to compel a carrier to perform a
particular and specified duty is so inherently- unjust and unreasonable as to amount to the deprivation of property without due process of law, or a denial of the equal protection of
the laws. in a case involving the validity of an order enforcing
a scheme of maximum rates of course the finding that the
enforcement of such scheme will not produce an adequate
return foithe operation of the railroad, in and of itself dem-

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 25

Opinion of the Court.

onstrates the unreasonableness of the order. Such, however,
is not the case when the question is as to the validity of an
order to do a particular act, the doing of which does not involve
the question of the profitableness of the operation of 'the railroad as an entirety. The difference between the two cases is
illustrated in St. Louis &c. Ry. Co. v. Gill, 156 U. S. 649, and
Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, 186 U. S. 257.
But even if the rule applicable to an entire rate scheme were
to be here applied, as the findings made below as to the net
earnings constrain us to conclude that adequate remuneration
would result from the general operation of the rates in force,
even allowing for any loss occasioned by the running of the
extra train in question, it follows that the order would not be
unreasonable, even if tested by the doctrine announced in
Smyth v. Ames and kindred cases.
It is insisted that, although the case be not controlled by
the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames, nevertheless the arbitrary and
unreasonable character of the order results from the fact that
to execute it would require the operation of a train at a loss,
even if the result of the loss so occasioned would not have the
effect of reducing the aggregate net earnings below a reasonable profit. The power to fix rates, it is urged, in the nature
of things, is restricted to providing for a reasonable and just
rate, and not to compelling the performance of a service for
such a rate as would mean the sustaining of an actual loss in
doing a particular service. To hold to the contrary, it is
argued, would be to admit that a regulation might extend to
directing the rendering of a service gratuitously or the performance of first one service and then another and still another
at a loss, which could be continued in favor of selected interests
until the point was reached where by compliance with the last
of such multiplied orders the sum total of the revenues of a
railroad would be reduced below the point of producing a reasonable and adequate return. But these extreme suggestions
have no relation to the case in hand. Let it be conceded that
if a.scheme of maximum rates was imposed by state authority,

Opinion of the Court.

206 U. S.

as a whole adequately remunerative, and yet that some of such
rates were so unequal as to exceed the flexible limit of judgment which belongs to the power to fix rates, that is, transcended the limits of just classification and amounted to the
creation of favored class or classes whom the carrier was compelled to serve at a loss, to the detriment of other class or classes
upon whom the burden of such loss would fall, that such legislation would be so inherently unreasonable as to constitute a
violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Let it also be conceded that a like
repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States would
arise from an order made in the exercise of the power to fix
a rate when the result of the enforcement of such order would
be to compel a carrier to serve for a wholly inadequate compensation a class or classes selected for legislative favor even
if, considering rates as a whole a reasonable return from the
operation of its road might be received by the carrier. Neither
of these concessions, however, can control the case in hand,
since it does not directly involve any question whatever of the
power to fix rates and the constitutional limitations controlling
the exercise of that power, but is concerned solely with an
order directing a carrier to furnish a facility which it is a part
of its general duty to furnish for the public convenience. The
distinction between an order relating to such a subject and
an order fixing rates coming within either of the hypotheses
which we have stated is apparent. This is so because as the
primal duty of a carrier is to furnish adequate facilities to the
public, that duty may well be compelled, although by doing
so as an incident some pecuniary loss, from rendering such
service may result. It follows, therefore, that the mere incurring of a loss from the performance of such a duty does not
in and of itself necessarily give rise to the conclusion of unreasonableness, as would be the case where the whole scheme of
rates was unreasonable. under the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames
or under theconcessions made in the two propositions we have
stated. Of course, the fact that the furnishing .of a necessary

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. N. CAR. CORP. COM'N. 27
206 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

facility ordered may occasion an incidental pecuniary loss is
an important criteria to be taken into view in determining
the reasonableness of the order, but it is not the only one.
As the duty to furnish necessary facilities is coterminous with
the powers of the corporation, the obligation to discharge that
duty must be considered in-connection with the nature and
productiveness of the corporate business as a whole, the character of the services required, and the public need for its performance. A similar contention to the one we are considering
was adversely passed upon in Wisconsin &c. Ry. Co. v. Jacobson, supra. That case involved the enforcement of an order
of a state railroad commission directing a railroad company
to acquire the necessary land and make a track connection
for the purpose of affording facilities for the interchange of
business with another road. The court, after holding that the
order was not so unjust and unreasonable as to be repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States, disposed of the contention that the order was void because compliance with it
would necessitate the incurring of expense, by saying (179
U. S. 302):
"Although to carry out the judgment may require the exercise by the plaintiff in error of the power of eminent domain,
and will also result in some, comparatively speaking, small
expense, yet neither fact-furnishes an answer to the application
of defendant in error. Worceter v. Norwich & W. R. Co.,
