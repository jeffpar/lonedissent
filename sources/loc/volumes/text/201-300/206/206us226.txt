makes it certain that the language of paragraph 408 was deliberately used to apply only to beads actually loose. This
view is supported by the testimony as well. It was testified
that prior to 1897 the terms threaded and strung beads were
familiar in the importing trade, and that beads strung on
"threads for temporary use were commercially known at that
time as strung beads." And it was further testified that there
was an increase in value over unstrung beads from fifteen to
twenty per cent. on account of the labor attached to stringing.
Judgment affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. FARENHOLT.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 277.

Argued April 25, 1007.-Decided May.13, 1907.

A court is not always confined to the written words of a statute; construction
is to be exercised as well as interpretation and a statute will not be construed as giving higher pay to the inferior officer. Under the Navy Personel Act of March 3, 1898, 30 Stat. 1007, and ยง 1466, Rev. Stat., passed
assistant surgeons of the navy, as well as assistant surgeons, rank with
captains in the army and are entitled to the pay of a captain mounted.

Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel. was on the brief, for

MR.

Opinion of the Court.

JUSTICE MCKENNA

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellee filed a petition in the Court of Claims to recover
from the United States the sum of $282.66 for the difference,
he alleged, he was entitled to as a passed assistant surgeon in
the Navy, with the rank of lieutenant, for mounted pay from
December 26, 1900 to July 27, 1901, with ten per cent. increase
for service outside of the limits of the United States. He was
given judgment for $141.33. The ten per cent. increase was not
allowed.
A statement of the case is well expressed in 'the findings and
conclusion of the court, as follows:
"The claimant, Ammen Farenholt, entered the naval service
as an assistant surgeon May 29, 1894, and was promoted to the
grade of passed assistant surgeon May 29, 1897. He attained
the rank of lieutenant on December 26, 1900, and was a passed
assistant surgeon in the Navy with the rank of lieutenant during
all of the time covered by this petition.
"From December: 26, 1900 to April 12, 1901, he was on sea
duty attached to the U. S. S. 'Concord.' From April 12, 1901
to July 27, 1901, he was on sea duty attached to the U. S. S.
'Qregon.'
"The claimant has already received pay at mounted rates
for the periods before December 26, 1900, and after July 27,
1901, under the decisions of the Court of Claims in Richardson
v. United States, 38 C. Cl. 182, as applied by the Comptroller
of the Treasury in Brownell's Case, 9 Comp. Dec. 676, but the
Treasury Department declines to allow. him mounted pay between these dates only because it considers that it is deprived
of jurisdiction over the claim therefor by reason of a prior
allowance and settlement of pay for the same period.
"If entitled to army pay at mounted rates for this period
the amount due would be as follows:
Pay of a lieutenant of the Navy, which corresponds in
rank with a captain in the Army, mounted, from
December 26, 1900, to July. 27, 1901, with in-

"Before the date of the decision of this court in the case of
Richardson v. United States, 38 C. Cl. 182, January 5, 1903,
assistant .surgeons in the Navy received only the pay of an
officer of corresponding rank in the Army 'not mounted.' By
that decision it was held that they are entitled to the pay of
such an officer 'mounted.' This decision was not appealed
from and has been accepted as the proper interpretation of the
law. It has been applied by ruling of the Comptroller of the
Treasury to passed. assistant surgeons.
"All officers of the Medical Corps in grades for which there
is in the Army pay table a distinction between 'mounted' and
'not mounted' pay, have ever since been paid at mounted rates
of pay for their service from the date the personnel act took
.effect, July 1, 1899, to the present time.
Conclusion-of Law.
"Upon the foregoing findings of fact, the court decides as a
conclusion of law, on the authority of Richardson v. United
States, 38 C. Cl. 182, that the claimant is entitled to recover
against the United States the sum one hundred and forty-one
dollars and thirty-three cents ($141.33).
"By a majority of the court."
Section 13 of the act of March 3, 1898, 30 Stat. 1007, called
the Navy Personnel Act, provides ."that after June 30, 1899,
commissioned officers of the line of the Navy and of the Medical
and Pay Corps shall receive the same pay and allowance, except
forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for
the officers of corresponding rank in the Army."
Section 1466, Revised Statutes, assimilates in rank lieutenants in the Navy with captains in: the:Army. And Section 1261

UNITED STATES v. FARENHOLT.
206 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

fixes the pay of a captain mounted at $2,000 a year and a captain not mounted at $1,800 a year. Section 1262 gives ten per
cent. increase for each term of five years' service.
The appellee is a lieutenant in the Navy; he ranks with a
captain in the Army, but the question is, Of which class,
mounted.or not mounted?
The Government contends, with captains not mounted. Its
argument is that the extra pay that mounted officers receive
is not compensation, but reimbursement for expenses incurred,
and to give it to a naval officer who does not bear such expenses
would produce the inequality that the Navy Personnel Act was
passed to prevent. United States v. Crosley, 196 U. S. 332.
Counsel, however, concedes that Richardson v. United States,
38 C.. Cl. 182, was correctly decided, and that the rule has been
extended by the Comptroller of the Treasury to passed assistant
surgeons, but attacks the practice of the Comptroller and rejects the application of the Richardson case upon the distinction
between an assistant surgeon, which Richardson' was, and a
passed assistant surgeon, which appellee is.
The act of June 7,. 1900, 31 Stat. 697, provides that "the
active list of surgeons shall hereafter consist of fifty-five and
that all passed assistant and assistant surgeons of one hundred
and ten. Assistant surgeons shall rank with assistant surgeons
in the Army." Commenting on this statute the .Government
says: "Assistant surgeons in the Army being mounted the court
very justly granted mounted pay to Richardson, who ranked
with assistant surgeons in the Army." In other words, the
Government contends it was the purpose of Congress to give
the inferior officer the better pay. The Assistant Attorney
General ventures on no explanation of this anomaly, but insists upon the written word. A court is not always confined to
the Written word. Construction sometimes is to be exercised
as well as'. interpretation. And "construction is the drawing
of conclusions respecting subjects that lie beyond the direct
expression of the text from elements known from and given in
the text-conclusions which are in the spirit, though not within

the letter of the text." Lieber, 56. The application of this rule
is clear. Consideration of the provisions relative to the rank
and pay of officers of the Army and Navy make it evident that
Congress used the words "assistant surgeon" as descriptive of
the whole class of assistant surgeons, passed as well as those not
passed.
Jugdment affirmed.

GEORGIA v. TENNESSEE COPPER COMPANY.
BILL IN EQUITY.
No. 5, Original. Argued February 25, 26, 1907.-Decided May 13, 1907.
When the States by their union made the forcible abatement of outside
nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to
whatever might be done. They retained the right to make reasonable
demands on the grounds of their still remaining quasi-sovereign interests,
and the alternative to force a suit in this court.
This court has jurisdiction to, and at the suit of a State will, enjoin a corporation, citizen of another State, from discharging over its territory noxious
fumes from works in another State where it appears that those fumes
cause and threaten damage on a considerable scale to the forests and vege-

table life, if not to health, within the plaintiff's State.
A suit brought by a State to enjoin a corporation having its works in another
State from discharging noxious gases over its territory is not the same as
one between private parties, and although-the elements whichwould form
the basis (f relief between private parties are wanting, the State can maintain the suit for injury in a capacity as quasi-sovereign, in which capacity
it has an interest independent of and behind its citizens in all the earth
and air within its domain; and whether insisting upon bringing such a

suit results in more harm than good to its citizens, many of whom may profit
through the maintenance of the works causing the nuisance, is for the State
itself to determine..

facts are. stated' in the opinion..
