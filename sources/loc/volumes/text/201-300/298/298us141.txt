TIPTON v. ATCHISON RY. CO.
Argument for Petitioner.

TIPTON v. ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE
RAILWAY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 664. Argued March 31, 1936.-Decided April 27, 1936.
1. The remedy of an employee of a railway which is a highway of
interstate commerce for personal injuries suffered while he is
engaged about intrastate transportation, and caused by a breach of
the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, is the remedy afforded by the
common or statutory law of the State. P. 146.
2. In such cases, the State is at liberty to afford any appropriate
remedy for breach of the duty imposed by the federal Acts, including the remedy of workmen's compensation; and the state law on
the subject is binding on the federal courts. P. 147.
3. In California, the exclusive remedy in such cases is under the state
workmen's compensation act. P. 149.
4. A construction of a state statute by the state courts resulting from
their erroneous conception of federal statutes, is not binding on the
federal courts. P. 151.
78 F. (2d) 450, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 297 U. S. 700, to review the affirmance of a
judgment dismissing an action by a railway employee
against the Railway Company to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by a defective
coupling on a freight car, used in violation of the Federal
Safety Appliance Acts.

this duty regardless of the type of commerce in which the
employee was engaged when injured. Cases supra; Fairport, P. & E. Ry. v. Meredith, 292 U. S. 589; United
States v. California, 297 U. S. 175.
Since this right is a creation of the federal statute, it

must be conceded that, if the remedy is also a creation of
the federal statute, no mandatory state Workmen's Compensation Act can destroy either. Ward v. Erie R. Co.,
230 N. Y. 230, cert. dqn., 256 U. S. 696, and cases cited.
Assuming that the remedy afforded for the violation
of the duty is not a creation of federal law, but has been
left to the States, the question still remains as to whether
or not the State can abrogate the right of action given by
the common law by adopting a compulsory compensation
act.
From the decision of this Court in Texas & Pacific Py.
Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, to the decisions of this Court
(luring the 1933 October Term hereinafter referred to, it
was the almost unanimous opinion of the bar and of the
federal and state bench that the right and the remedy
were creations of the federal statute. The arguments
proving the basic soundness of this position and the reasons therefor are set forth in the Rigsby case, supra, and
are clearly expressed in the majority opinion of the Court
of Appeals of New York in Ward v. Erie R. Co., supra.
This view has been adhered to in the following cases
involving compulsory compensation acts: McManon v.

298 U.S.

springs from the common law of the States, we come to
the question of how far the States can abrogate the right.
It is important to consider that the compensation given
under a compulsory Workmen's Compensation Act is not
damages for violation of a right. It is compensation
arising because of a status and has nothing to do with a
violation of a duty. Kenna v. Calumet H. & S. E. R. Co.,
284 Ill. 301; North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 174
Cal. 1; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident
Comm'n, 294 U. S. 532.
The right created by the federal statute exists only in
so far as it can be enforced by action. There is no right
as distinguished from the right to enforce the liability
for the breach of duty. As the courts have stated, the
creation of the duty by Congress gave rise to a correlative right and that right can only be a right to recover
damages. Regardless of how far the States can regulate the particular remedy for a violation of that right,
they can not destroy the right by refusing any remedy,
any more than they could make "assumption of risk" a
defense. This, a compulsory compensation act purports
to do, and this it can not do.
Consequently whether the right and remedy are creations of the federal Act, or only the right isa creation of
the federal Act, in neither event can the right be
destroyed by a compulsory compensation Act.
Assuming that the existence of any remedy for injury,
caused by a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts, is a
matter left to the States and that a State can. adopt a
compulsory compensation Act and make it the sole
remedy, California, where the accident occurred, has not
done this.
The Court accepts the meaning and scope given to a
state Workmen's Compensation Act by a local state court.

Opinion of the Court.

The Federal Safety Appliance Act does not give petitioner any right to sue his employer. Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 291 U. S. 205; Minneapolis,St. P.
& S. S. M. R. Co. v. Popplar, 237 U. S. 369; Gilvary v.
Cuyahoga Valley R. Co., 292 U. S. 57.
Petitioner's rights are defined by the California Workmen's Compensation Act within the jurisdiction of the
Industrial Accident Commission of the State, by appropriate proceedings therein, and not by any action at law
in the courts.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioner, a citizen of California, brought an action against the respondent in the Superior Court of the
State to recover for injuries sustained in the course of his
employment as a switchman. The complaint recites that
the respondent, a Kansas corporation, is a common carrier by railroad in interstate commerce, authorized to
transact business in California, and that the line on which
the accident occurred is a highway of interstate commerce. The cause of petitioner's injury is alleged to
have been a defective coupling apparatus upon a freight
car, used in violation of the Federal Safety Appliance
Acts.' The complaint does not state that, at the time of
the accident, petitioner Was engaged in interstate commerce. After removal to the federal court a demurrer
was filed challenging the complaint for failure to state a
cause of action. The demurrer was sustained and leave
to amend refused. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,
holding that as the petitioner, when injured, was not engaged in interstate commerce, he may seek redress only

Opinion of the Court.

under the California workmen's compensation act.:' The
petitioner sought review by this court on the ground that
the decision conflicts with adjudications of the California
courts sustaining the right to maintain an action for damages in like circumstances. We granted certiorari.
The Safety Appliance Acts impose an absolute duty
ulion an employer and prescribe penal sanctions for
breach. The earliest, that of 1893, affected only cars
which were being used in interstate commerce. By the
Act of 1903 the duty was extended to all cars used upon
any railroad which is a highway of interstate commerce.'
The absolute duty imposed necessarily supersedes the
common law duty of the employer. But, unlike the Federal Employers' Liability Act, which gives a right of
action for negligence, the Safety Appliance Acts leave
the nature and the incidents of the remedy to the law of
the states.4 The Safety Appliance Acts modify the enforcement, by civil action, of the employe's common .law
right in only one aspect, namely, by withdrawing the defense of assumption of risk.' They do not touch the
common or statute law of a state governing venue, limitations, contributory negligence, or recovery for death by
wrongful act.0

TIPTON v. ATCHISON RY. CO.
141

Opinion of the Court.

In Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, it
was decided that, as the first Safety Appliance Act had
been extended by later legislation to equipment used in
intrastate transportation upon a railroad which is a highway of interstate commerce, an employe injured as the
result of a violation of the act, in respect of a car so used,
is entitled to recover for breach of the duty imposed on
the carrier. Nothing more was there adjudicated. While
the opinion discussed the power of Congress, in connection with such regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, not only to enlarge the common law
duty of the employer and thus alter substantive rights
of the employe, but also to afford a correlative remedy,
the construction put upon the Safety Appliance Acts was
that they remit the person injured to such remedy as the
state law affords.
As respects an injury occurring during the course of
employment in intrastate activities on a highway of interstate commerce, the question has arisen whether a
state may substitute workmen's compensation for the
common law or statutory action whereby damages could
have been recovered for violation of the Safety Appliance
Acts. A number of courts have interpreted the discussion in the Rigsby case as a denial of the power of the
states to make the substitution.!
This court has recently reaffirmed the principle that
the Safety Appliance Acts do not give a right of action
'Ross v. Schooley, 257 Fed. 290; Director General v. Ronald,

for their breach but leave the genesis and regulation of
such action to the law of the states. In Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 291 U. S. 205, it was held competent to a state to embody the provisions of the Federal
Safety Appliance Acts in its own statute and to provide
that an employe injured by violation of the federal acts
should have a cause of action under the local statute.
In Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., 292 U. S. 57,
it was decided that an elective compensation act afforded
appropriate redress to an employe injured in intrastate
transportation as a result of violation of the Safety Appliance Acts; and it was said that those acts do not dictate or prescribe the method of the enforcement of the
liability arising from the breach of the duty they impose,
or extend to the field occupied by a state compensation
act. In Fairport,P. & E. R. Co. v. Meredith, 292 U. S.
589, an action in a state court, based upon a violation of
the Safety Appliance Acts, this court held the application of the doctrines of contributory negligence and last
clear chance by the state court raised no federal questions
reviewable here.
In McMahon v. Montour R. Co., 270 U. S. 628, cited
by the petitioner, the judgment of the state court was
reversed, not because that court had held that remedy
for breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance
Acts was afforded by the state workmen's compensation
law, but because of its erroneous decision that the federal
acts were inapplicable to the cars used in intrastate operations of the railroad, although it was a highway of interstate commerce.8
California is at liberty to afford any appropriate remedy
for breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance
Acts. Her choice in the matter raises no federal question
and the federal courts are as much bound as those of
'McMahan v. Montour R. Co., 283 Pa. 274, 276; 128 Atl. 918.

TIPTON v. ATCHISON RY. CO.
141

Opinion of the Court.

California to conform to the remedial procedure she has
adopted. There is nothing to prevent her prescribing
workmen's compensation, elective or compulsory, in lieu
of a common law or statutory action for disability or death
arising from a breach of the duty imposed. The question
is: has California, as the petitioner insists, excepted from
the scope of her workmen's compensation act injuries
sustained by an employe engaged in intrastate transportation? The Circuit Court of Appeals thought she had
not. Whether this conclusion is right depends upon the
force and effect of two District Court of Appeal decisions, which the Supreme Court of the State refused to
review.
Ballard v. Sacrameto Northern Ry.Co., 126 Cal. App.
486; 14 P. (2d) 1045, 15 P. (2d) 793, was an action by
the administratrix of a brakeman who was killed as a
result of a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts. The
defendant's railroad was a highway of interstate coininerce but the decedent was not engaged in interstate
commerce at the time of the-accident. The complaint
contained no count based upon the Federal Employers'
Liability Act. Nevertheless, the court in affirming a
judgment for the plaintiff, dealt with the trial court's
charge as to contributory negligence as if the action were
one brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act,"
and 4'eferred to the amending Act of 1910,0 conferring on
state and federal courts concurrent jurisdiction of actions
for damages under the Liability Act, which has no bearing upon actions brought under the Safety Appliance Acts.
The railway company insisted that the state workmen's
compensation act afforded the only redress for the decedent's death. In overruling the contention the court
cited Smithson v. Atchison T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 174 Cal.
April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, U. S. C. Tit. 45, §§ 51-59.

298 U.S.

148; 162 Pac. 111, a case dealing not with the Safety
Appliance Acts but with the Employers' Liability Act,
saying that the two statutes correspond in force and effect. The court added (p. 495):
"By subdivision 'C' of section 69 of the Workmens' Compensation Act, it is expressly provided that where interstate commerce questions are presented, resort to the
courts is not prohibited."
In Walton v. Southern Pacific Co., 8 Cal. App. (2d)
290; 48 P. (2d) 108, plaintiff as administratrix sued
for the death of her husband, an employee of the defendant. The first and third counts were based upon
the Federal Employers' Liability Act; alleged the decedent and the defendant were engaged in interstate
commerce at the time of the accident; and described
the negligence alleged to have caused the decedent's
death. The second count was founded upon the
Federal Boiler Inspection Act."' A trial resulted in a
judgment for the plaintiff. Holding that the decedent
was not engaged in interstate transportation, the court
proceeded to discuss the count framed under the Boiler
Inspection Act. It overruled the defendant's contention
that the cause of action was barred, basing its decision
upon the section of the state code of civil procedure limiting the time within which to bring an action for death.
In this connection the court referred to Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra, as deciding that the Safety
Appliance Acts do not affect the time of bringing suit
or govern the right to recover for death; and also noted
the statement in Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co.,
supra, that the right to recover damages sustained by the
injured employe "sprang from the principle of the common law" and was left to be enforced accordingly or, in
the case of death, "according to tne applicable statute,"
"U. S. C. Tit. 45, §§ 22-34.

TIPTON v. ATCHISON RY. CO.
141

Opinion of the Court.

and that the safety acts "do not extend to the field occupied by the State Compensation Act." Correctly holding that the same principles apply in an action under the
Boiler Inspection Act as in one under the Safety Appliance Acts, the court said that the former does not purport to provide remedial procedure where it is invoked as
a ground of recovery lor death caused in an intrastate
operation, and added: "Hence, in an intrastate case such
as this, the state law applies." Dealing with the defendant's contention respecting the Workmen's Compensation
Act, the court said (p. 115):
"The appellant's contentions that the sole remedy of an
employee of a common carrier, engaged in interstate transportation, or, in this case, of his personal representative,
where, at the time of the injury, the employee was not
engaged in interstate transportation, but under circumstances where there has been a violation of duty imposed
by the Boiler Inspection Act, is under the State Workmen's Compensatiofi Act are untenable (St. 1917, p. 831,
as amended). The evidence here shows that the accident
happened on a highway of interstate commerce ...
"Under the authority of Ballard v. Sacramento Northern Railway Co., 126 Cal. App. 486, 14 P. (2d) 1045, 15 P.
(2d) 793, the instant suit is maintainable."
If these decisions of intermediate courts of appeal, and
the refusal of the Supreme Court of California to review
them, amount to no more than a judicial construction of
the compensation act as having, by its terms, no application in the circumstances, they are binding authority in
federal courts.1 2 If, on the other hand, the state courts
excluded railroad employees injured in intrastate operations from the benefits of the compensation act, not as a
matter of construction of the statute, but because they
thought the Safety Appliance Acts required the State to

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

298 U.S.

afford a remedy in the nature of an action for damages,
then the court below was right in disregarding that erroneous construction of the federal acts."
. In the Ballard case the court thought the Safety Appliance Acts, in addition to imposing a duty, afforded a
remedy, and to deny that remedy would be to disregard
the mandate of the federal statutes. It was proper, in this
view, to construe the language of the compensation act
accordingly. In the Walton case, while holding the Boiler
Inspection Act irreleyant upon the question of the appropriate remedy, the court denied the application of the
workmen's compensation law, upon the authority of the
Ballard case.
The Supreme Court of the State refused to review either
of the cases although this court had recently defined the
scope of the Safety Appliance Acts in the Moore and Gilvary cases. If we were convinced that the court acted
solely upon a construction of the workmen's compensation law, uninfluenced by the decisions following the supposed authority of the Rigsby case, we should not hesitate
to hold United States courts bound by such construction of
the state statute. But the terms of the state compensation law, and the California decisions construing it, lead
us to doubt that this is so.
The act, in § 6, provides: 14
"(a) Liability for the compensation provided by this
act, in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person; shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an
employer for any injury sustained by his employees arising
out of and in the course of the employment . . .
"(b) Where such conditions of compensation exist, the
right to recover such compensation, pursuant to the provisions of this act, shall be the exclusive remedy against
the employer for the injury or death; . . .
"Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109, 120.
" It Deering's General Laws of California, pp. 2276-7.

TIPTON v. ATCHISON RY. CO
141

153'

Opinion of the Court.

Section 69 provides:'
"(c) Employers engaged in interstate commerce. This
act shall not be construed to apply to employers or employments which, according to law, are so engaged in
interstate commerce as not to be subject to the legislative
power of the state, or to employees injured while they are
so engaged, except in so far as this act may be permitted
to apply under the provisions of the Constitution of the
United States or the acts of Congress."
Thus,. by its plain terms, the compensation law embraces, injuries to an employe circumstanced as was the
petitioner i;1 this case. Employers or employments in
interstate commerce (the phrase used) obviously signifies situations covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act which gives a right of action for breach. The
phrase does not exclude injuries consequent upon violation of the Safety Appliance Acts in intrastate commerce
and the remainder of the section evinces a determination that the compensation act shall govern the rights of
employes in interstate commerce so far as permissible
under the federal laws.' As has been shown, these laws
do not forbid its application in the instant case.
The Supreme Court of California has repeatedly declared the purpose and effect of the compensation act.
"The enactment substitutes a new system of rights and
obligations for the common-law rules governing the liability of employers for injuries to their workmen. The
change thus made is radical, not to say revolutionary. In
place of the old action, in which the employer was liable
only if he, or someone representing him, had been guilty
of negligence or misconduct, the new law imposes upon
the employer a liability for any accidental injuries to his
employees arising out of the employment-a liability not

conditioned upon any negligence of the employer, or any
want of negligence on the part of the employee.""
"The California Workmen's Compensation Act provides the only means by which an injured employee can
recover compensation from his employer. for injuries received in the course of and arising out of his employment,
and it abrogates the common-law liability of the master
for such injuries in the cases to which it is applicable.
(Netherlands American Steam Nay. Co. v. Gallagher,282
Fed. 171, 183.) The obvious intent of the act was to
substitute its procedure for the former method of settling
disputes arising between those occupying the strict relationship of master and servant, or employer and employee,
by means of actions for damages. (Cooper v. Industrial
Ace. Com., 177 Cal. 685, 687 [171 Pac. 684].) It substitutes a new system of rights and obligations for the common-law rules governing the liability of employers for
injuries to their employees. (Western Indemnity Co. v.
Pillsbury, 170 Cal. 686, 692 [151 Pac. 398].) When the
specified conditions exist, the remedy provided by the act
is exclusive of all other statutory or common-law remedies. (DeCarli v. Associated Oil Co., 57 Cal. App. 310
[207 Pac. 282].)" 18
We are not persuaded that if the state courts had
thpught that California was free to ordain a plan of workmen's comperation in lieu of an action for damages for
breach of the duty imposed by the Safety Appliance Acts
they would have restricted the scope of the Workmen's

Syllabus.

Compensation Act as was done in the Ballard and Walton
cases., A definite and authoritative decision that its scope
is so limited,-and that the appropriate remedy under state
law is an action for damages, will, of course, be binding
upon federal courts. In the absence of such a pronouncement we are of opinion the Circuit Court of Appeals committed no error in construing the Workmen's Compensation Act as affording the only remedy available to the
petitioner.
