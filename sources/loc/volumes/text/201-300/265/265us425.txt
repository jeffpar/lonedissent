265 U. S.

The American was organized, in June, 1918, as a war
measure, to *take over the express business done on the
railroads which had come under federal control. -After
the Government relinquished such control, this consolidation of the 'transportation business and property of the
express companies was approved by the Commission.
under paragraph 7 of § 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act
as amended by Transportation Act, 1920. Consolidation
of Express Companies,59 1. C. C. 459. Uniform cqntracts
were entered into by the American with substantially, all
the railroads of the United States, Express Contract,100,
59 1. C. C. 518; and it enjoyed a practical monopoly of
the railroad express business until May 1, 1921. On that
day the Southeastern Express Company entered the field,
by utilizing for that purpose the Southern Railway system and affiliated lines, in all about 10,000 miles of railroad. Many cities and towns in the southeastern States
are now served both by the American and by the Southeastern. These are called common points. A larger
number in those States are served only by one of the
companies. These are called exclusive points. Except in
the southeastern States, practically all railroad express
offices in the United States are exclusive points of the
American.
The Southeastern sought to have the American agree
with it to establish through routes and joint rates between all points served by them respectively, whether
common points or exclusive; and to permit the shipper
to give the routing instruction. The American declined
to do this; limiting its concurrence to routes between the
exclusive points of one company and the exclusive points
of the other. In this way, it attempted to secure t6 itself
either the entire haul or the longest possible haul. 'Thereupon, theSoutheastern instituted, before the Commission,
proceedings against the American, praying that the Commission establish the through: routes and joint rates
sought. Another proceeding, seeking in .part like relief,
was brought against the two express companies by ship-

Commission ordered -the establishment of some of the

adequate service, it was necessary aid desirable in the
.publio interest that competitive -.joint routes be established, although the American had reasonable routes from
origin to destination, or from origin to a point nearer
destination than the joint through routes established.

-

'The Commission found "that it is necessary and desirable in the
public interest that additional reasonable direct through routes and
joint rates shall be maintained between points on the lines of the
American Railway Express Company and points on the lines of the
Southeastern Express Company, regardless of the fact that one
company may have a reisonable direct single-line route, or join in a
reasonable direct joint route via another junction which allolws it a
longer'haul; that the rates between any two points shall be the same
regardless of the route over which the shipment may move or the
number of lines -over which it may travel; that joint through routes
shall be established, in instanies .where they will result in reasonable direct T6utes, so that there will be at least two reasonable dire6t
routes between such points, one of which shall be via the transfer
point selected by the Southeastern Express Company, and the other
via the traisfer point selected by.the Americali Railway Express
Company;- and that the tariffs shall provide for the right of the
shipper to designate the routing of express shipments over the routes
established.

See 78 . C. C. 128, 143.* The order (81 I. C. C. 247) required the companies to estab~lsh,
on or before October 20, 1923, through routes between all points in
the States of Maine, New Hampshire, VYrmont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, and New Ydrk, N. Y., and all points on the
direct routes of the American R&4way Express Co. between New York
and Washington, D. 9., on the one hand, and all points on the main
line of the Southern Railway Co. from Washington to and including
Birmingham,'Ala., on the other, with transfer between the com-:
panies at Washington, D. C.; that the rates between these p6intp
shall not exceed the rates contemporaneously in effect bltween the

Southeastern Express Co. v. American, Ry Express Co.,

Before the effective date of the order, this suit to en- join its enforcement was brought by the American against
the United States in the federal court for northern
Georgia. The Seaboard Air Line Railway, one of the
many railroads with which the American has a contract,
intervened as plaintiff. The Commission, the Southeastern, the Southerii Traffic League and other shippers'
associations intervened as defendants. The case was
heard on application for a: temporary injunction by three
judges, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38
Stat. 208, 219, 220; the order was held void on the
ground that the American is 'a "carrier by railroad"
within the meaning of paragraph 4,.ahcl that, therefore,
the Commission was, on the facts found, without power
to make. the order;. and a temporary injunction 2 was
granted, Circuit Judge Bryan dissenting. 293 Fed. 31.
The case js here oh separate appeals from that decisionby the several respondents. - The three appeals present
the same questions of law.
First. The power to establish through routes is conferred broadly as to all carriers by paragraph 3 of § 15. 8
The limitation upon the power in respect to a "carrier
by railroad" is imposed by paragraph 4.. The language
'The opinion stated that the injunction would be " without prejudice to the right of the Commission to enquire whether, because the.
existing routes are unreasonably long, or for other cause particularly
appearing, any of the proposed new routei can be established coniistently with paragraph 4 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce
Act, and, if so, to order their establishment." 293 Fed. 31, 38.
The Act to Regulate Commerce, of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24
Stat. 379, did not confer upon the Coimnission any power fo establisl through routes. Conipare Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate

Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 536, 553. The amendment of
June 29, 1906,.c. 3591, § 4, 34 Stat. 584, 590, conferred power to do
so "when that may be necessary to give effect to any provision of
this Act, .and the carriers complained of have refused or neglected

which embodithis limitation is not appropriate to-describe the situation of an express ocimpany. It is that the
Commission may not .compel the carrier, to efrbrace hi
the through route "substantially less than the entirelength of its railroad and of iny intermediate railroad
operated in conjunction and under a common -management or control therewitY, which. lies between the termini
."
An exof such proposed through route, unless
press company.has no railroad. It is served by many
railroads, as it is served by water lines, by motor trucks
and by horses and wagons. Moreover, the language of
to voluntarily establish such through routes and joint rates, provided no reasonable or satisfactory through route exists." The
amendment of June 18, 1910, c. 309, § 12, 36 Stat. 539, 552, struck
out the proviso and substituted therefor the linitation now reenacteil in paragraph 4 of § 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act as
amended by Transportation Act, 1920. The latter act struck out,
also, the clause in the Act of 1910 by which the Commision's:power
to establish the through routes was dependent upon failure of the
carriers to establish them yoluntarily.'
Section 1, par. 3, provides that "the term 'common -carrier' as
used in this Act shall include all pipe-hue companies; telegraph,
telephone, and cable companies operatingiby wire or wireless; express companies; sleeping-car companies, etc.' Section 1, par. 4,
imposes upon every carrier of property the duty to establish through"
routes. -Section 15, par. 1, (which deals, among other things, with
joint rates) confers the regulatory powers in respect to "ankr common carrier or carriers subject to this Act for the transportation of
persons or property or for the transifission of messages as defined
in the first section of this Act.' .Paragraph 2, of § 15, deals only
with thp time when the orders under par. 1 take effect. Paragraph 3 'contains no words limiting the scope- of the Commssion's
power to establish trough routes to "carriers by railroad!' The
limitation impiosed, as abplied to "carriers by railroad," appears
first in par. 4. Prior to Transportation Act, 1920, the existence
of the unrestricted power to establish through routes and joint
rates appears to have been assumed without question by the Commission in In re'1Ezpres Rates, etc., 24 I. C. C. 380, 392-4; 28

paragraph 4 describes aptly a single railroad system, but
not a system of express routes extending over many separate railroad systems. Practically 'very express company
has had, as the American has now, routes over many separate railroad systems 4 However numerous the railroads.
used, all the routes are parts of a single'express system:
If an express company is -a-" carrier by railroad," the.
"entire length of its railrdad" must, as the *American
argues, be construed to mean the entire length of- all the
lines of the railroads within the United States over which
it has 'routes. Such a cdnstruction would, if adopted,
tend .to give permanency to an existing monopoly although it failed to give adequate service.. For it would
deprive the Commission of powe: to foster the competition found necessary to secure sucl seir4ce. There is
nothing in Transportation Act, 1920, whichi evinces .an
intention on the part of Congress to accomplish such a
purpose.
The natural meaning of the term "carrier by railroad"
is one who operates a railroad, not .one whose shipments
are carried by a railroad. The term is not found in the
original Act to Regulate Commerce which was applicable
only to carriers "engaged in the transportation of pas'In 1911 -there were 13 express companies of which the 16 important ones conducted their service over 218,013 miles of railway,

of 1906 extended:.the-..Commissioh's jurisdiction to express companies, sleeping car companies and pipe lines,
and that of 1910 'extended its jurisdiction to telegraph,
telephone and cable companies,. 6ccasion for differentiat"ing between carriers arose; as some of the provisions of
the Act to Regulate'Comnmerce were obviously not applicable to all the classes of carriers which had been made
subject to regulation. But to what extent its provisions
should be applied to any class was left, by those-amendments, largely to construction. In Transportation Act,1920, the phrase " c arrier by railroad" seems to have

been systematically -employed tb designate sections of
the Interstate Commerce Act which .apply only to carriers operating railroads." The tetrm was introduced by
8 See

§ 1. The phrase used in all later sections of the original act
is "any common carrier, subject to the provisions of this act."
See §§ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20. Compare § 22.
The Commission held in In re Ezpress Companies,1I .C.349,-that
while express business conducted, as a department of -a railroad
was subject to the original act, such business when conducted by
an independent company, which had acquired rights by contract
with the railroad, was not subject to the act. Nor is the term
"carrier by railroad" found in the amendments of March 2, 1889,
c. 382, 25. Stat. 855; of February 10, 1891, c. 128, 26 Stat. 743;
or of February.19, 1903., c. 708, 32 Stat. 847. In the amendmedt
of 1905, it appears in § 2 (34 Stat. p. 586); and in the amendment
of 1910, it al~pears in §§ 8 and 9 (36 Stat. p. 548). But in connection with the establishment of through routes, the use of the
term " c ar ri er by railroad" appears for the first time in the amendment made by Transportation Act, 1920.

it in paragraph 4 in place of the word ".bmpany" which
had been used in the amendment of 1910 The purpose
of the substitution was to make it clearer that the prohibition against compelling a carrier to short-haul its
traffic was limited -to railroads. The same phra§e had
been adopted in the Federal Employers' Liability Act of
April 22, 1908, c. 149, §§ 1, 2, and 3, 35 Stat. 65,'66V
As used in that act, it was held in Wells Fargo & Co. v.
Taylor, 254 U. S. 175, 187, .188, not to include independent express compinies doing business over railroads.
In § 15(4) of Transportation Act, 1920, it shoild be
given the same meaning.. Compare United State" ez rel.
Chicago, New York &.Boston Refrigerator Co. v. Inter-

state Commerce Commission, ante, 292.

Second. The American. claims that the order is void,
even if the limitation contained in paragraph 4 is not appl.cable to express companies. One contention: is that the
order exceeds the power conferred upon the Commission,

because it is, as a matter of law, unreasonable to establish
a second through route merely for the sake of securing
"Section 15, as amended by the Act of June 18, 1910, c" 309, 36 "
Stat. 539, read: "The Commission, shall not require any company,
without its consent, to embrace-in such route substantially less than
the entire length of- its railroad, etc."
'The phrase had been introduced in the Safety Appliance Act of
March.2, 1903, c. 976, § 1, 32 Stat. 943; but it was not found in
the original Safety Appliance Act of March 2,. 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531; nor in the amendinent thereof of April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat.
298. The term is used in the Hours of Service Act, March 4, 1907,

competition in service.' Another contention is that the
order exceeds the power conferred upon the Commission
because it purports to authorize the shipper to-give routing instructions. The further claim is made fhat the
American has, as a matter of law, the right to carry, over
its own lines, traffic which it originates, as long as this
can be done without unreasonably delaying the delivery
at-destination; that this right to haul its traffic to destination is property protected by the Fifth Amendment;
that to authorize the shipper to give routing instructions
takes this property; and that the provision for making
an equitable division of the joint rate does not.afford the
legal compensation for the taking to which it is entitled.
The Southeastern insists that these claims, although
adequately presented in the bill of complaint, cannot be
availed of in this Court, because they were overruled-by
the District Court and the American did not take a crossappeal. The objection is unsoufid. It is true that a party
who does not appeal from a final decree of.the trial court
cannot be heard in opposition thereto when the case is
brought here by the appeal of the adverse party. In other
words, the appellee may not attack th& decree with a
view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of
lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he
seeks is to- correct an error or to supplement the decree
with respect to a Inatter not dealt with below. But it is
likewise settled that the appellee may, without taking a
cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve
an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an
insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it 0 By
the claims now in question, the Aiierican does not attack,

in any respect, the Aecree entered below.". It merely
asserts additional grounds why the decree should be affirmed. These grounds will be examined.
The comp6titive route ordered must, of course, -bereasonable in character from thd standpoint of transportstion; and there must be reasonable cause for establishing
it. In this case, :no objection is made to the character of
the routes ordered. The objection is that, as a, matter of
law, the competitive routes cannot be justified because the
time required foi" delivery. over the existing routes of the
American is as short as it would be under the competitive
.joint routes. To this objection the action taken by Con-'
gregs supplies an answer. Under the Act of 1906, the
Commission could act only if no "reasonable pr satisfactory through route exists." In Interdtate Commerce
Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 216 U. S. 538,
this Court set aside an order to establish a second through
route because it deemed the existing one adequate. There-upon, Congress, by the Amendment of 1910, struck out
the proviso and empowered the Commission to establish"
through routes "whenever deemed by it to 'be necessary
or desirable in the public interest!" In transportation, the
quality of the service furnished-may'be as important to
the shipper as the iate. The Commission fouhd, in theproceeding under review, that the service of the American,
"in some histances, had been inadeciiate; and that in
"considering.competition, time is not the only imp6rtant
element. Competition tends to make each c6mpany jm- .
prove its general treatment of th" 'public, its practices,
The'decision in.Peoria& Pekin. Union, Ry.Co. v. U.ited States,

rules, and regulations in regard to its methods of doing

business." It found, also, that the "service at. common
points has improved since the formation of the Southeastern." Its conclusion, that the establishment of the competitive routes was necessary and desirable in: the public
interest, is not shown to have been unreasonable.
The existence of a competitive route ordinarily implies
an option in. the shipper. To give him the privilege of
directing the routing is a corollary of the establishment of
competitive routes. Upon shippers -of railroad freight
this right was expressly conferred by Congress, in paragraph 8 of § 15, subject only "to guch reasonable exceptions and regulations" as the.Commission may prescribe.
The rights, in this respect, of shippers by express, were
not dealt with in terms. The matter was, therefore, left
subject to 'egulation by the Commission under general
provisions of the at Paragraph 3,-which empowers the
to establish through routes, authorizes it,
-Commission
also, to fix "the terms and conditions under which such
through routes.shall be operated." Its order that the
shipper by express may direct the routing is not unreasonable 2 As the American has no absolute right to
retain trafc which it ,originates, and. as the provision
Sauthorizing the shipper to direct' the routing is reasonable,
