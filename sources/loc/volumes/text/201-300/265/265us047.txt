Mr. Solicitor GeneralBeck for defendant in error.
I. The Constitution confers on Congress a broad power
4
to lay and collect taxes.
Referring to this power, this Court said in the License
Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462: "It is given in the Constitution
with. only one exception and only two qualifications.
Congress can not tax exports, and it must impose direct
taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by
the rule of uniformity. Thus limited, and thus only, it
reaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion.'
The rule announced in these cases 'was reitated and
affirmed in'Polock v.'Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., -157
U. S. 429. .Tothe same effect are Nicol v. Ames, 173
U. S. 509; KnOwlton. v. Moore, 178 U. S.41; and Flint
v. St6ne Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107. See'Brushaber-v.
.Uniion PacificR.R. Co., 240 U. S. 1.
II. The tax'imposed on the plaintiff is not unconstitutional because it applies to income from property outside
of the United States.
This Court has decided (Brushaber Case, supra) that
even before the adoption of- the Sixteeiith Amendment'
Congress might tax all property and the income from all
property. Stanton v; Baltic Mining Co., 240 U. S.103.
All taxes are personal obligations of the citizen, even
though measured in amount by his property o'r the income

thereof. Taxes are not imposed upon property as such
but upon its owner.
The contention that taxing the income is not authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment, if well founded, would
apply equally to a citizen residing in the United States,
and deriving his entire income from sources outside of
the United States; -and yet unquestionably Congress has
such power of taxation over citizens. residing within the
United States. How can the duty of the citizen to support the government which protects him depend upon
his place of residence? Wherein does the Constitution
impose such a limitation upon the power of Congress to
tax?
The Sixteenth Amendment made it immaterial whether
income were or were hot derived from property.
III. The courts have clearly indicated that Congress
may tax the income of one who is subject to its jurisdibtion, although that income is derived from sources outside
of the United States. Nevada Bank v. Sedgwick, 104

U. S. 111; Memphis & Charleston, R. R. Co. v. United
States, 108 U. S. 228; 26 R. C. L., pp. 85, 86; United

them. I Hyde, supra, p. 451. Our Criminal Code (§§
308, 309) forbids the sale of arms, liquors, or opium to
the aboriginal natives of Pacific islands which are not in
the possession of or under the protection of any civilized
power; and an act of Congress (March 3, 1915, a. 74 §§
1-13, 38 Stat. 817) regulates the practice of pharmacy and
the sale of poisons in consular districts in China. Under
treaties the United .States has established consular courts
for American citizens in several countries. So also, personal representatives of a sovereign, members of the diplomatic corps, -carry their national law with them, and they
are immune from the operation of the laws of the countryto which they are sent. I Hyde, supra,pp. 746-763.
Counsel for the plaintiff urge that. the"imposition of
such a tax upon him would be subvertive of the -sovereignty of Mexico. The rules of international law, however, indicate that there is no subversion of the sovereignty
of the countr- when a resident alien obeys the command
of his own national sovereign, unless the command of his
sovereign conflicts with the command 'f the local sovereign.
VI. The leading text writers upon international law
concede that a national sovereign has the power to impose
taxes upon its nonresident citizens regardless of the
sources from which such-incomes are derived. I Oppenheim, Int. Law, p. 195; Bar, Int. Law, 2d el., p. 247;
Story,"Conflict of Laws, 7th ed., pp. 21, 22, 682; I Westlake, Int. Law, pp. 111, 112, 206, 208; I Hyde, Int. Law,

167, 168.

The payment of an income tax by a nonresident 6itizen
is looked upon as primafade evidence of -itizenship. The
failure to pay such an income tax is, inter alia, of considerable weight in determining that the nonresident
citizen has given up his allegiance to the United States.

Action by plaintiff in error, he will be referred to as

The tax was imposed under the Revenue Act of 1921,
which provides by § 210 (42 Stat. 227, 233): "That, -in.
lieu of the tax imposed bp section 210.of th; Revenue Act.
of 1918, there shall be levied, collected, and paid for each
taxable year upon the net income of every individual a
normal tao of 8 .per centum of the amouni of the net
income in excess of the credits provided in section 216:

Tlie following regulation, No. -62, promulgated by the- Commis-

sioner of Internal Revenue under the Revenue Act of 1921, provides

in Article 3: ".Citizens of the United States except those entitled to
the benefits, of section 262 . . . wherever resident, are liable to
the tax. It makes no difference that they may own no assets within

the United States and may receive no income from sources within
the United States. Every resident alien individual is liable to the
tax, even though his income is wholly fron sourees outside the United
States. Every nonresident alien individual is liable to the tax on
his income from sources within the United States."

5OCTOBER

TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court..

265 U. S.

Plaintiff iH a native citizen of the United States and was
such when he took p his residence and becane domiciled
in the City of Mexico. A demand was made upon him
by defendant in error, designated defendant, to make a
return of his income for the purpose of taxation under the
Revenue Laws of the United States. Plaintiff ebmplied
with the-demand, but uhder protest, the income having
been derived from property situated in the City of Mexico. A tax was assessed against hi in the sum of
$1,193.38, the flrst.installment of which he paid, and for
it, as we have said, thi action was brought.
The question in the case, and-which was presented by
the demurrer to the declaration is, a expressed by plaintiff, whether Congress has power to impose a tax upon
income received by a native citizen of the United States
who, at the time the income wis received, was permanentlyxesident and domiciled in the City of Mexico, the
income being from real and personal property located in
Mexico.
Plaintiff assigns against the power not only his rights
under the Constitution of the United States but under
international law, and in support oPthe assignments cites
many cases. It will be bserved that ihe foundation of
the assignments is the fact that the citizen receiving the
inome, and the property of which it is the product, are
outside of the territorial limits of the United States..
These two facts, the contention is, exclude the eistence
of the power to tax.- Or to put the contention another
way, as to the "ex.stence of the power and its exercise, the
person receiving the income, and the property from which
he receives it, must both be within the territorial limits of
the United States to be within the taxing power of the
United States;. The contention is not justified, and that
it is not justified is the necessary deduction of. recentcases. In. UMited States v. Bennett, 232 U. S. 299, the
power of the United States to tax a foreign built yacht
-owned and used during the taxing period outside of the

COOK v. TAIT.
47

Opinion of the Court.

United States by a citizen domiciled in the United States
was sustained." Thd tax passed on was imposed by a
tariff act,2 but necessarily the power does not depend
upon the.form by which it is exerted.It will be observed that the case contained only one
of the conditions of the present case, the property taxed
was outside of the United States. In United States v.
Goelet, 232 U. S. 293, the yacht taxed was outdde of the
United States but owned by a citizen of the United States
who was "permanently resident and domiciled in a foreign. country." It was decided that the yacht was not

subject to the tax-but this as a matter of construction.
Pains were taken to say that the question of power was
determined "wholly irrespective" of the owner's "permanent domicile in a. foreign country." And the Court put
out of view the situs of the yacht. That the Court had
no"doubt of the power to tax was illustrated by reference
to the income tax laws of prior years and their express
extension to those domiciled abroad. The illustration
has pertinence to the case at bar, for the ease at bar is
concerned with an income tax, and the power to impose it.
We may make further exposition of the national power
as the case depends upon it. It was illustrated at once in
United States v. Bennett by a contrast with the power of a
State. It was ppinte& out that there were limitations
upon the latter thAt were not on the national power. The
taxing power of a State, it was decided, encountered at its.
borders the taxing power of other States and was limited
by them. -There was no such limitation, it was pointed.
'Section 37, Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, o: 6, 86 Stat. 11, 112,
provided in part as follows: "There) shall be levied and collected
annually on- the first day of September by the collecatr of customs
of the district nearest the residence of the managing owner, upon the
use of every foreign-built yacht, pleasure-boat or vese1 not used or
intended to be used for trade, now or hereafter owned or chartered
for more than. six months by any citizen or citizens of the United
States, a sum equivalent to a tonnage tax 6f seven dollars per gross
ton."

out, upon the national power; and the limitation upon theStates affords, it was said, no ground for constructing a
barrier around the United States " shutting that governmenf off- from the exertion of powers which inherently
belong to it by virtue of its sovereignty."
The contention was rejected that a citizen's property
without the limits of the United States derives no benefit
from the United States. The contention, it was said, came
from the confusion of thought in "mistaking the scope
and extent of the sovereign power of the United States as
a nation and its iefations to. its citizens and their relations
to it." And that power in its scope and extent, it was
decided, is based on the presumption that government by
its very nature benefits the citizen and his property
wherever found, and that opposition to it holds on to
citizenship vhile it "belittles and destr6ys its advantages
and blessings by denying the possession by government of
an essential power required to miiake citizenship completely beneficial." In other words, the principle was Aedared that the government, by its very nature, benefits
the citizen and his property wherever found and, therefore, has the power to make the benefit complete. Or to
express, it another way, the basis of the power to tax was
not and cannot be made dependent upon the situs of the
property in all cases, it being in or out. of the United
States, and was not and cannot be mide dependent upon
the domicile of the citizen, that being in or out of the
United States, but upon his relation as citizen to the
United States and the relation of the latter to him as
citizen. The consequence of the relations is that the
native citizen who is taxed may have domicile, and the
property from which his income is derived may have
situs, in a foreign country and .the tax be legal-the
government having power to impose the tax.
