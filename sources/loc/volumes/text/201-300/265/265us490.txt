OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
265 U. S.

Syllabus.

96 Okla. 78; and, after the proceeding was carried to
judgment, petitions for certiorari were denied by that
court and by this Court, 263 U. S. 721.
We think the District Court rightly dismissed the bill.
A court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appoint-

ment and removal of public officers, White v. Berry, 171
U. S. 366;. and particularly are the courts of the United
States sitting as courts of equity without jurisdiction over
the appointment and removal of state officers. In re

Sawyer, 124 U. S.200, 210. And see Taylor v. Beckham,
178 U. S.548; 570. That the removal is through a proceeding in the nature of a criminal prosecution does not
alter the rule.

In re Sawyer, supra,'pp. 210, 219.

'Williamsfor re-

JusTcsi VAN Dwv.TER delivered the opinion of'

the Court.
In a recent report of-the receiver in this case, he called
attention to an actioh- brought against him in the District
Court of Wichita County, Texas, by 3. H. Duhon and H. J.
Kebideaux, the object-of which is to enforce payment by
him of the claim herfinafter described. On examining
the report, this Cburt ordered the plaintiffs in that action
to show cause why they should iot be enjoined from
maintaining it. In-due time they submitted a response.
The claim sought to be enforced is one for reimbursement for the cost of drilling an oil well in the iiver bed;
and, if paid, must be paid ou. of an impounded fund in
the receivr's custody. The well was drilled prior to the
receivership, and without right. In nojpossible view did
the drilling give rise to an enforceable claim against the
receiver or against any property in the receivership.
The right asserted against the receiver is based on a
subsequent order of this Court, 256 U. .S. 607. That
order is not imperative or mandatory; nor does it purport
to give any operator or driller a right to be reimbursed.
On the c.ontrary, it commits the question of reimbursement to the receiver's- discretion. Its words are, "is
hereby authorized, in his discretion," etc. Obviously the
receiver's action in a matter committed to his discretion
by this Court can not be controlled by any other court.
The plaintiffs say that the receiver recognized their claim.
Even so, they assert and reassert that there has been no

reimbursement. If this be true, the matter still restsin
the receiver's discretion. A mere recognition of the claim
would not terminate his discretion. He would be free to
reconsider until there was an actual reimbursement.
If the plaintiffs desired to enforce reimbursement regardless of the receiver's discretion, they should have
applied to this Court for 9 mandatory order. No other'

court could change the existing order, or require the
receiver to surrender his discretion under it; and yet that
is-what the plaintiffs seek to accomplish by their action
against the receiver. They rely on ยง 66 of the Judicial
Code which reads as follows:
"Every receiver or manager of any property appointed
by any court of the United States mak be sued in respect
of any act or transaction .of his in carrying on the business
connected with such property, without the previous leave
of the court in which-such receiver, or manager was appointed; but such suit .shall be subject to the general
bquity jurisdiction of the court in which such manager or
receiver was appointed, so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice."
Whether the section rightly understood applies to a
receiver appointed by this Court in a suit within its
original jurisdiction we need not consider. In terms it
is confined to suits against a receiver in respect of his acts
or transactions while carrying on the business of the receiverihip. Here the receiver is not sued in respect of
any act or iransaction of his in the course of the business,"
but in respect of acts occurring pfior to the receivership,
for the cost of which this Court by a subsequent order
authorizejd him, in his dicretion, to make reimbursement.
Under the plaintiffs' showing, the receiver's only connection with the matter has been a refusal to exercise his
discretion favorably to them. That, in our opinion, is not
such an act or transaction as the section intends.
