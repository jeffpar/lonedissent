to use the mails for the purpose. Section 5480 has since
been again amended to make its scope clearer. Its construction in the Horman,Case can not be used as authority
to include within the legal definition of a conspiracy to
defraud the United States a mere open defiance of the

governmental purpose to enforce a law by urging persons
subject to it to disobey it.
We think the demurrer to the indibtment in this case
should have been sustained and the indictment quashed.

UNITED STATES v. SUPPLEE-BIDDLE HARD-

WARE COMPANY
APPEAL FROM THM COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 477. Argued April 9, 1924.-Decided May 26, 1924.
1. The "Revenue Act of 1918" (passed February 24, 1919),'i-the
income tax provisions applicable to corporations, adopts the defii tion of gross income applicable to individuals (§ 213), which excludes "the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death
of the insured to individual beneficiaries or to the estate 6f the
insured". Held, that there was no purpose, in the exemption, to
distinguish between individual beneficiaries, and corporate beneficiaries, and that the proceeds of insurance taken by a corporation
on the life of an important official, to secure its financial position
and indemnify itself against loss of earning power in case of his
death, were not taxable as income under the act. P. 194.
2. Assuming that Congress could tax proceeds of such indemnity life
insurance as income, its purpose to do so should be lxpress, in view
of the popular conception of life insurance as resulting in a single
addition to the resources of the beneficiary and not in a periodical
return. P. 195.
3. A construction of a war taxing act as imposing bo-'i an income and
an estate tax on the proceeds of life insurance should be avoided
unless required in express terms. Id.
58 Ct. Clms. 343, affirmed.

from a, judgment of the Court of Claims allow-

ing recovery bf money paid under protest as an income

tax.
Mr.Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Soliciftor General Beek and Mr.
FredE.Hamilton.were on the brief, for the United States.
Under the terms of the Revenue Act of 1918, the proceeds of life insurance payable to corporate beneficiaries
are taxable as income.
The definition of gross income in the case of a corporation is exactly the same as in the case of an individual
It includes gains, profits, and income derived from any
source whatever, and the specific mention of certain forms
.of income cannot narkow the meaning of this all-inclusive
language. The proceeds of these insurance policies represented a gain, a profit,, and an inicome growing out of
the transaction of a business carried on for gain or profit.
If the-general language admits of any doubt, the specific
language removes the doubt. That Congress, in all legislation passed since the Sixteenth Amendment, regarded
the proceeds of life insurance policies as a form of income
which they had authority to tax is sbown by.a comparison
of the language'used in the various acts. Act of October
3, 1913, e. 16, § II, subd. b, 38 Stat. 114; T. D. 2090,
December 14, 1914; Act of Sbptember 8, 1916, c. 463, § 4,
39 Stat. 756; Act of October 3, 1917; c. 63, 40 Stat. 300;
Revenue Act of 1918, § 213; Act of November 23, 1921,
c. 136, 42 Stat. 227.
First, the proceeds of life insurance policies were exempt
when paid td hidividual beneficiaries, and this restricted
exemption was continued until after the armistice. Then
the exemption- was further extended to include policies
payable to the estate of the insured, and, finally, after the
war was over and the necessity for extreme taxation had
passed, the restrictions were wholly removed, and they
are now wholly exempt.

U. S. v. SUPPLEE-BIDDLE CO.

Argument for the United States.

The proceeds of -the policies are included by direct
language and the court below has been forced to resort to
-implication in order to exclude them. Everything not
excluded is taxed. Everything not specifically excluded
is income. Everything is included that the statute does
not exempt, and the first item exempted is the proceeds
of life-insurance policies paid upon the death of the insured to individual beneficiaries or their estates. The
construction of the act by the Court of Claims fails
wholly to give effect to the words "individual beneficiaries or to the estate of the insured." This language
surely has a different meaning fi'om the language employed in the Acts of 1913, 1916, and 1917. According to
the reasoning of the,-Court of Claims, these words have
no meaning, and the Act of 1918 means the same as the
Acts of 1913 and 1921.
See Commercial Health & Accident Co. v. Pickering,
Fed. 539.
281The
omission of the words "individual beneficiaries"
in the Act of 1921 does not amount to a legislative construction of the Act of 1918 and to a declaration that it
was never the intention of Congress to attempt to tax such
proceeds of insurance as income. United States v. Field,.

Opinion of the Court.

265 U. S.

The proceeds of life insurance are not withi the definition 6f gross income as found in § 213 of the Revenue Act
of 1918 and such proceeds are not taxable under said act.
Towne v. Eisner,245 U. S. 418; Eisnerv. Macomber, 252
U. S. 189.
Life insurance proceeds are not "income" within the
meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and are therefore
not taxable.
Mr. Henry Necarsulmer and Mr. Max 3. Koler, by
leave of Court, filed a brief as amici curiae.
delivered the opinion of the
MR. Czmr JusTiCJ Tr
Court.
The Supplee-Biddle Hardware Company sued the
United States in the Court of Claims to recover $55,153.89, with interest, as taxes illegally assessed on the
proceeds of two life insurance policies paid to it as the
beneficiary on the death in 1918 of the insured, Robert
Biddle, 2nd. Biddle was elected President of the Company in February, 1917. He was then thirty-seven years
of age, in good health, and had for nearly twenty years
held various 6ffices, in the Biddle Hardware Company,
which had merged with the appellee company in January,
1914. He was a man of ability, energy and initiative and
*as so regarded in the hardware trade. The returns from
the Company's business under Biddle's management had
been much increased. At the instance of the Board of
Directors and the expense of the Company, he took out
the two policies for $50,000 each. They were term
policies for five years. The Company intended thus to
make secure its financial position, and to indemnify itself
against losses to its earning power in the event of Biddle's
death.
The Revenue Act of 1918, which was passed February
24, 1919 (40 Stat. 1057, c. 18), in prescribing the income
to be taxed, deals first with individuals, from § 212 to

Opinion of the Court.

§ 228, inclusive. Then follows provision for the rate of
income tax on corporations, beginning \with § 28.Y Section 233(a) says "That in the case of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 the term 'gross
income' means the gross income as'defined in section
213," with certain exceptions not here material. Section
213 defines the grossiincome for individuals as follows:
" That for the purposes of this title (except as otherwise provided in section 233) the term 'gross income '"(a) Includes gains, profits, and income derived from
salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service
whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or
S.of
from.professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce,
or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal,
growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such
property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities,
or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or
profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any
source whatever

. ; but

"(b) Does not include the following items, which shall
be exempt from taxation under this title:
"(1) The proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon
the death of the insured to individual beneficiaries or to
the estate of the insured."
The Treasury Department, construing these sections,
held that the proceeds of insurance policies paid to a beneficiary which was a corporation, were not exempted and
.
. from any source what-.
were included as " gains
ever." Under this ruling the appellee was forced to
pay a tax of $84,737.95 on the proceeds of the two policies
of $97,947.28. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
reduced this amount by $29,584.06 in accordance with the
powers conferred upon him by §§ 327 and 328 of the
Revenue Act of 1918 to reduce the rate bf taxation in
cases of unusual hardship. There remained, however, the
sum of $55,153.89, which tax the appellee paid under

protest, and for this with interest, the Court of ClaIns
gave jpudgment to the appellee.
We think the Treasury Department erred in assuming
that Congress intended by §§ 233 and 213 to distinguish
between individual beneficiaries and corporate beneficiaries in including the proceeds of life insurance policies
as within gross income. We think the two sections have
no such purpose. Section 213 primarily applies only tothe taxing of individuals. The union of proceeds of life
insurance payable to individual beneficiaries and to the
estate of the assured was th.us intended to emlhasize the
exclusion from taxation in the hands of individuals .ofall
.uch proceeds and to leave no doubt of it. The meaning
is the same as if the clause had read "the proceeds of life
insurance shall not be included in gross income whether
they are paid to individual beneficiaries -orto.the estate of
the assured." When Cbn'gress came to deal with the
gross income of corporations, it made use-of § 213 by reference and grafted it on to § 233. It is reasonable that the
purpose of § 213 to exclude entirely the proceeds of life
insurance policies from taxation in the case of individuals
should be given the same effect in adapting its application to corporations, and that such proceeds should be so
excluded whether by the direction of the insured they
were to go to specially named beneficiaries or were toinure to the estate of the insured.
Nor do we find any difficulty with the expression in
paragraph (b) which exempts proceeds of life insurance
from gross income. The word.is used not to indicate that
they would be otherwise included in the income to be
taxed, but only to make clear .that the gross does not indude them.
It is arnestly pressed upon us tlat proceeds of life insurance paid on the death of the insured are in fact capital
and can not be taxed as income under the Sixteenth
Amendment. Eimer v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207;

Opinion of the Court.

Merchants' Loan & Trust (o. v. Smietank%, 255 U. S.
509, 518. We are not required to meet this question. Ii
is enough to sustain our construction of the act to say
that proceeds of a lfe insuranc6 policy paid on the death
of the insured are not usually classed as income.
Life insurance in such a. ease as the one before us is
valid and is not a wagering contract. There- was certainly an insurable interest on the part of the Company
in the life of Biddle. Mutual Life Insurance Co.v. Board,
115 Va. 836; Keckley v. Coshocton Glass Co., 86 Oh. St.
213; Mechanics National Bank v. Comins, 72 N. H. 12;
Unifed Security Life Ins. & Trust Co.v.Brown, 270 Pa.
St. 264. Life insurance in such a case is like that of fire
and marine ins irance, a contract of indemnity. Central
Bank of Washington v. Hume, 128 U. S. 195. The benefit
to bp gained by death has no periodicity. It is a substitution of money value for something permanently lost either
in a house, a ship, or a life. Assuming without deciding
that Congress could call the proceeds of such indemnity,
income, and validly tax it as such, we think that in view
of the popular conception of the life insurance as resulting
in a single addition of a.total sum to the resources of the
beneficiary, and not in a. peri6dical return, such a purpose
on its part should be express, as it certainly is not here..
This view is strengthened by the fact that under § 402.
p. 1097, of the same Revenue Law of 1918, a decedent's
estate tax is levied, with rates ranging -from one per
centum to twenty-five per centum on the net estate which
is made to include (par.*f) "the amount receivable by the
executor as insurance under policies taken out by the
decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess
over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the
decedent upon his own life.' The result of the construction put by the Government upon §§ 233, 230 and 213

would be to impose a double tax on the proceeds of the
two policies in this case over and above $40,000, i. e., an
income tax and an estate tax. Such a. duplication even
in an exigent war tax measure is to be avoided unless required by express words.

APPEALS FROM THU DISTRICT COURT OF THE VNTIM STATES
FOR TB WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

Nos. 540 and 789. Argued April 17, 1924.--Decided May 26, 1924.
I

1. When the jurisdiction of a state court to review orders of a commission fising rates is confined to determining -on the record
certified by the commission whether the order is lawful and reasonable and whether evidence was improperly excluded, without power
to pass on the weight or sufficiency of evidence or to enter any
new order in lieu of the one appealed from, the remedy is purely
judicial, and need not be invoked ly a party complaining of the
rates fixed as confiscatory, before seeking relief in a federal court.
Remington's Comp. Washington Stat. 1922, § 10428, considered.
"P. 200.
2. A state statute empowering a commission after hearing to refuse
an increase of rates proposed by a public utility, cannot, by forbidding supersedeas until a final judicial decree has been rendered
in the state courts, prevent recourse to a federal court for temporary relief by injunction. P. 201.
3. Under the law of Washington, Rem. Comp. Stat. 1922, § 10441,
providing for revision of administrative valuations of the property
of public utilities, the function of the state courts is not merely
judicial but also legislative, since they can pass upon the weight
of evidence, and can set aside a valuation and make a new one.
Ke7ler v. Potomac o., 261 U. S. 428. Id.
4. The fact that a public utility had resorted to the state courts,
acting legislatively, to chang6 a valuation of its property, would
not bar it from seeking relief in the federal court against rates
based on the valuation as approved by the state courts. P. 203.
