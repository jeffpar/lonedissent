ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON

No. 211. Argued February 25, 1924.-Decided May 26, 1924.
1. The treaty-making power extends to all proper subjects of negotiation between our Government and.foreign nations, including that
of promoting friendly relations by establishing rules of equality between foreign subjects whil6 here-and native citizens. P. 341.

2. A rule of equality thus established stands on the same footing of
supremacy as the Federal Constitution and laws, cannot be rendered nugatory in any pait of the Uiited States by municipal ordinances or state laws, operates without the aid of legislation, state or
national, and is to be applied and given authoritative effect by the
courts. Id.
3. A treaty is to be liberally construed; when two constructions are
vossible, one restrictive of rights that may be claimed under it and
the other favorable to them, the latter is to be preferred. P. 342.
4. The Treaty of April 5, 1911, with Japan, provides that the citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties shall have
liberty to enter, travel and reside if the territories of the other

recognized as a business by the law of the State of Washington, is

approval- to the argument. Huntwortk v. Tanner, 87"

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

265 U. S.

The right to prohibit must be found in the inherent
nature or characteristic of the business at which the legislative act is directed.
The business of pawnbroker is lawful and the legislature
cannot prohibit any honest man from engaging therein.
If the business is not lawful, the City cannot license it.
The City, however, is asserting the power to license the
business, and it thereby is foreclosed from contending that
the business itself is not lawful. Furthermore, the business is recognized as lawful by the statutes of the State.
The argument which is made to sustain this ordinance
incontrovertably leads to the conclusion that any dis-.
honesty occurring in,
a business justifies the legislature in
abolishing the business.
The City cannot decline to grant aliceeise to the plaintiff in error merely because he is a subject of the Emperor
of Japan. Though an alien he is protected by the Equal..
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Citing
many decisions, including Terracev. Thompson, 263 U. S.
197; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; Trhzw v. Raich,
239 U. S. 33.
Again, the plaintiff ii error has the right to .engage in*
business as a pawnbroker by the express terms of ยง 1977,
Rev. Stats. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; United
States v. Tong Kim Ark, 169 U. S.649; Whitefield v.
Hanges, 222 Fed. 745.
Notfiing said by this Court in the case of Teriace v.
Thompson,.263 U. S. 197, is in conflct with the foregoing.
It must be remembered that the' question before the
Court in that case was the right of the State to prohibit'
.aliens from owning or leasing real estate within the limits
of the State, and that general language in an opinion
must be restrained to the particular facts before the
Court.
The Treaty between the United States and Empire of"
Japan *doesnot permit of the refusal of the City to grant."
the plaintiff in error the'license in question.

Mr. CharlesT. Don'worth,with whom Mr. Thomas J. L.

The ordinance involved must be treated as a statute of
the State of Washington. Shepard v. Seattle, 59 Wash.
363; Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U. S. 86.
Every legislative act is presumed to be constitutional,
and if any state of facts can be reasonably conceived to
exist which would sustain the act, the Court will presume
such facts to have existed.
The motives of the legislators in enacting a law will
not be inquired into by the Court.
No person has a vested right to engage in pawnbroking.
Because of the facilities that it affords for aiding in and
concealing the commission of crime, it has always been regarded by the law as an inherently vicious occupation
which may-be prohibited entirely. It is not a necessary
business and engaging in it is merely -a pyrivilege. St.
Joseph v. Levin, 128 Mo. 588; Grand Rapids v. Braudy,

While, so far as our investigation dcisloses, this Courthas never had occasion to pass upon the status of pawnbroking under the police power, it has discussed the power
of the State to prohibit inherently vicious and non-useful
occupations. Crowley v. Christensen,137 U. S.86.

In that decision it was strongly intimated that the
muhicipal authorities might pick and choose, between applica~ts for licenses and grant licenses only when deemed
proper. Booth v. Illinois, 184 U. S. 425; Murphy v. California, 225 U. S. 623; Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S.
197.

. The ordinance involved in this case merely restricts the

-

privilege of engaging in this unnecessary and inherently
vicios occupation to citizens of the United States. Since,
under the authorities citeoi, the city council could have
prohibited the occupation entirely, it can limit its exercise
to citizens of the United States without violating the Fourteenth Ainendnient or the guarantees contained in the
Japanese Treaty.
It has been'held in numerous cases; that if the business
is one that may be prohibited, alienage may justify the
denial of the privilege, though of course a State cannot
discriminate between aliens and citizens in respect to those
useful businesses which every person: may follow as of
right. Trmax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33; Peoplev. Crane,214

Ames, 47 Wash. 328; Ozawa v. United States, 260 U. S.
178; Yamashitav. Hinkle, 260 U. S. 199. -That the classificatioAi adopted by the city council in the present case
does not deny the plaintiff in error equal protection of the
laws, is conclusively shown by Terrace v. Thompson, 263
U. S. 197. ( See also Fric v. WeIb, 263 U. S. 326; Webb
.v. O'Brien, 263 U. S. 313.
The basis of classification between aliens and citizens
being a proper one, the ordinance is not invalid because
Congress has so far failed to mke Japanese subject to
naturalization
Furthermore, the burden of showing that the classification complained of does -not rest upon any reagonable

ASAKURA v. SEATTI.

basis, is upon the plaintiff in error. .Lindsley v. Natural
CarbonicGas Co., 220 U.-S. 61.
The legislators had a right to presume that pawnbroking
would be conducted by citizens with less harm to the publie welfare than when conducted lby aliens. In any event,
this Court cannot substitute its judgment upon this question for that of the legislati'e body. Crescent Oil Co. v.
Mississippi,257 U. S. 129; Heislerv. Thomas Colliery Co.,
260 U. S. 245.
The Federal Government through the treaty-making
power caninot restrict the police power of a sovereign
State. Missouriv. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, discussed.
So far as. our investigations disclose, the only opinion
of this Court which squarely passes upon the relation between the treaty-making power of the Federal Government and the police power of the States, is that of Mr.
Justice Daniel, in the License Cases, 5 How. 504. Chief
Justice Taney, in his dissenting opinion in the Pdasenger
Cases, 7 How. 283, expressed a similar view, and Mr.
Justice Daniel in that case approvingly quoted from his
former opinion. Although these were minority opinions,
those of the majority do not seem to disigee with them
o
upon this point.
Another expression of this Court to the effect that the
treaty-making power is limited by the other provisions of
the Constitution and b3 the peculiar nature of our form
of government, is found in Geofroy" v. Rigs, 133
U. S. 258.
Mr. Justice White rendered a special concurring opinion
in Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S.244, concurred in by Justices Shiras and MeKenna, pointing out that the tredtymaking power must beinterprete"l with reference to the
nature of our government and in harmony with related
provisions of the Constitution. See Compagnie Francaise
v. Board of Health, 51 La. Ann. 645; s. c.- 186 U. S. 380,

If Congress and the President cannot enact a statute
which violates the Tenth Amendment, how can the President and the Senate, together with some alien minister or
other diplomatic representative, enter into a treaty which
has that effect? The decision in Missouri v. Holland,
supra,intimates that such is the case, but even if the broad
statement referred to be correct, the facts of that case
are distinguishable from the present case in that the subject-matter was not local and internal.

As was said in Kansa v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 90:

"The 'powers affecting the internal affairs of the States
not granted to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to.%e States
respectively, and all powers of a national character which
are not delegated to -the National Government by the
Constitution are reserved to the people of the United
States .
.
. This Article X is not to be shorn of its
meaning by any narrow or technical construction, but is to
be considered fairly and liberally so as to give affect to
its scope and meaning."
One of the poVers reserved to the State (which is to be
liberally construed), is the police power, pursuant to
which a State may prohibit callings dangerous to .the
.public.
If the treaty-making power should be declared to be not
limited by the other provisiohs of the Constitution, then
it becomes a convenient substitute for.legislation in fields
over which Congress has no jurisdiction. As this Court
"knows, a treaty is usually drafted secretly by the State
Department or commissioners appointed by the President, in conference with some foreign representative.
*This Court has always restrained attempts on the part
of either the Federal Government or the States to encroich upon or impair the powers of the other. Slaughter-

Japanese
Treaty does not guarantee the privilege
of engaging in pawnbroking.
The term "frade" as used in the treaty, means dealing
in commodities as a bu~yer or seller, but can not reasonably
be held to include the indiscriminate loaning of money
upon pledge of persoiial effects.. May v. Sloan, 101 U. S.

While treaties must be construed liberally to make effective the intention of the parties, yet a strained construction such as suggested by plaintiff in error should not be
indulged in. We agree that the word "trade" is used in
the ordinary acceptation of the term, but where was the
word ." trade" ever used to describe the act of pawning,
or the term "tradesman" to designate a pawnbroker?
It has already been demonstrated that pawnbroking is
a privilege. This being so, the provisions of 'the treaty are
inapplicable. Patsone v. Pennsylvani, 232 U. S. 138;

ML JUSTICE Buwmm delivered the opinion of the Court.

Plaintiff in error is a subject of the Emperor of Japan,
and, since 1904, has resided in Seattle, Washington. Since
July, 1915, he -has been engaged in business there as a
pawnbroker. The city passed an ordinance, which took
effect July 2, 1921, regulating the business of pawnbroker
and repealing former ordinances, on the same Subject. It
-make&it unlawful for any person to engage in the business
unless he shall have a license, and the ordinanee.pro-des

"that no such license shall be grantedunless the applicant
be a citizen of -theUnited States." Violations of the ordinance are punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.
Plaintiff in error brought this suit in'the Superior Court of
King County, Wdshington, against the city, its Comptroller and its Chief of Police to iestrain them from enforcing the ordiianqe. against him. He attacked the ordinance on the ground that it violates the treaty between
the United States and.the. Empire Qf 'Japan, procla med
April 5, 1911, 37 Stat. 1504; violates the constitution of
the State of Washingt6on, and also the due process and
equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. He declared his
willingness to.eoiply with any valid ordinance relating to
-the business of pawnbroker. Itwas"showi that he had
about $5,000 invested in his business, Which would b6
broken up and destroyed by the enforcement of the ordi-nance. The Superior Court granted the relief prayed.
On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State held the orit-.
nance.valid and reersed the decree. The cise is here on
writ of error under a 237 of the Judicial Code.
Does the ordinance violate the treaty? Plaintiff in
eiror invokes and relies upon the following provisions:
1.Thb citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting
Parties shall have literty to enter, travel and residce in
-theterritories of the other to carry oia trade, vholesale and
retail, to own or lease and occupy houses; manufactories,

to lease land 'for residential and commer"i! purloses,

trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects,
submitting themselves'to the laws and regulations there
established.

The treaty-making power of th United States is not

makes it impossible for aliens to carry on the business. It
need not be considered whether the State, if it sees fit,
may forbid and destroy the business generally. Such a
law would- apply equally to aliens and citizens, and-no
question of conflict with the treaty would arise. The
grievance here alleged is that plaintiff in error, in violation of the treaty, is denied equal opportunity.
It remains to be considered whether the business of
pawnbroker is "trade" within the meaning of the treaty.
Treaties are to be construed in a broad and liberal spirit,
and,. when two constructions are possible, one restrictive
of rights that may be claimed under it and the other favorable to them, the latter is to be preferred. Hauenstei v.
Lynham, 100 U. S. 483, 487; G4?ofroy v. Riggs, smpra, 271;
Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424 437. The ordinance
defines "pawnbroker" to "mean and include every person whose busihess or occupa.tion. [it] is to take and receive by way of pledge, pawn or exchange, goods, wares
or merchandise, or any kind of personal property what-ever, -for the repaymeqnt or security of any money loaned
thereon, or to loan money on deposit of personal
properti"; .and defines "pawnshop" to ."mean and
include every place, at which the business of pawnbroker is carried on:" The language .of the treaty is
comprehensive. The phrase "to.carry on trade" is broad.
That it is not'to be given a restricted meaning is plain.
The clauses "'to own or lease . .
shops,
to lease land for .- . . commercial purposes, ana

generally to do anything incident to or necessary for
trade," and "shall receiv . . . the most constant
protection and seciuity for their . . . property ..

all go to show the intention of the parties that the citizens
or subjects of either shall have liberty in the territory of
.the other to engage in all kinds and classes of business that
.are or reasonably may be embraced witilin the meaning
of the word *" trade" as used in the"treaty.

ASAKURA v. SEATTLE.
32'" ""Opinion

43

of.the Court.

,By definition contained in the ordinance, pawnbrokers
are regarded as carrying on a "business." A feature of.it
is the lending of money upon the Iedge or pawn of personaL property which, in case of default, may be sold to
pay the'debt. While the amounts-of the loans made in
that business Ire relatively small and the character of
property pledged as security is different, the transactions
are similar to loans made by banks on collateral security.
The.business of lending money on portable securities has
been :carried'on for centuri. 'In most of the countries
of Europe, the pledge system is carried on by goyernmental agencies;'in some of them the business is also carEnglahd, as in the UVnited
ried on by privit.e parties. Ii.
States, the jrivate pledge system prevaijs. In this
"country the prgctice of pledging personal property for
loans dates back to early coloial times, and pawnshops
have been rogulated-by state laws for more th.n'a century.
We have found no state legislati6n abolishing or forbidding the business. Most, if not afl, of the States provide'
for licensing pawnbrokers and aithorize regulation by*
municipalities. While, regulation has been found_.necessary in the public intei'est '; the busfiess is not on that
account to be excluded from the trade and commerce re-'
ferred to in the treaty. Many worthy occupations and.
lines of legitimate business are regulited by.st4te and federal laws for the protection of the piblic against fraudulent and dishbnest practices. There is nothing in the char-acter of the business ofpawnbroier which requires-it to be
excluded from the field covered by the above quoted provision, and it must.be held that such business is "rade"
Wvithin the meaning of the.treaty. The ordinance violatus
the treaty. The question in the present dase relates solely
to Japanes& subjects who have been admitted to this
country. We do not pass upon'the'right of admissioii or
the construction of.the treaty in this reject, as that question.is not before us and would require, consideration of
