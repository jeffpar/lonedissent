made upon the employer in.furtherance of the-rehabilitation of such employees of other employers as have been.
incapacitated in the course of hazardous work. No less
arbitrary and unreasonable would be an enactment requiring a building contractor, should a structure in course
of erection by hing collapse,, without resultant injury or
death, to contribute $900 to a rehabilitation fund.
-The subject of judicial inquiry, in such a case as this,
is whether the statute under consideration " is arbitrary
and nreasonable, from the standpoint of natural justice,"
'White Case, at p. 202; or "'soextravagant or arbitrary
as to constitute an abuse of power.' Mountin Timber
Case, at p. '237. Such was the test applied" in determining the validity of the Arizona Act. 250 UI S.'421422, 420. As recently fis in Cudahy Packing Co. v. Parramore, 263 U. S. 418, this Court examined the *question
w' ther the liabilfty prescribed by the Utah Workmen's*
Compensation Act- was imposed unreasoiably, capriciously and arbitrarily.
How unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary was the
action of'the New York legislature in fixing $900 as the
amount-, of the Ibontribution compelled by the statute
under review is,.demonstrated by the circumstance that,
when it came to a general revision of the Workmen s
Compensation Law, by c. 615, Laws of 1922, the compulsory contribution was changed to $500, a provision which
is the subject of consideration in Sheehan Co. v. Shuler,
to be argued herewith. See ante, p. 371.
There being no claim that any element of pubic. health
or of public safety is involved, and no'real consideration
of public welfare being presented, it follows that the
act in question may properly be characterized as unreasonable and fundamentally.-unjust.
The compulsory payment denies to the employer the
equal protection. of the laws, in contravention of the
-Fourteenth Amendment.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.*

Classification is not fairly made. It is only the employer whose deceased employee left no dependents that
is singled- out 'for involuntary contribution to the rehabilitatioh fund. lothing but the fortuitous circumstance of absence of puch dependents renders the employer liable to the exaction.* Gulf, Colorado & Santa
Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150; State v. Haun, 61 Kans.
146; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., 183 U..S.

268.
No mere regulation of the relation of brnployer and
employee is involved.
In sustaining the. principle of compulsory workmen's
compensation legislation, this Court, in the White Case,
supra, and in the Mountainm Timber Case, .supra, dwelt
upon the reciprocal advantages inuring to both employer
and employee by the substitution, in. the case of the employer, of a definite but limited liab.ility for the uncertain hazards of a verdict, and by the substitution, in the
case of the employee, of a moderate but ascertained compensation for the doubtful remedy of a law suit in which
the common-law defenses of assumption of risk, contributory negligence and negligence of a fellow servaiht
were available. Here, however, in exchange for the lia"bility imposed, this employer gains no relief from an
action at law.
The Chief Justice observed in Truax v. Corrigan, 257
U. S. 312, 339: "It seems a far cry from classification on
the basis of the relation of employer and employee in
respect of injuries received in course of employment to
classification based on the relation of an employer, not
to an employee, but to one who has ceased- tb be so."
Is it not even a more distant cry to classification based
on the relation of an employer to those beneficiaries of
the rehabilitation fund who, in the vast majority' bf instances, have never been in his employ?

Opiion of the Court.

265 U. S.

In the Washington statute involved in the Mountain
Timber Case the principle of classification was observed
to the extint of compelling an employer to contribute
to the state fund ohly for the benefit of workmen of
other employers engaged in the same class of Qccupation.
243 U. S. 219, 236-7, 241-2.
Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, Deputy Attorney General, with
* whom Mr. Carl Sherman, Attorney General of the State
of New York, was on the brief, for defendants in error.
MR. JusT m SAoRD delivered the opinion of the
Court.
-This case, which was heard with Sheehan Co. v. Shuler,
No. 593, just decided, ante, 371, likewise involves the question of *the constitutionality of the amendment to the
Workmen's Compensatidn Law of New York relating to
the creation of a special fund lor the maintenance of employees undergoing vocational rehabilitation.
The on y difference between the two cases in this respect is that the present case arose under the Laws of
1920, c. 760, by which the amendment (then constituting
subdivision 8 of ยง 15 of the Compensation Law), required
the employer to pay.te sum of nine hundred dollars to
this special fund, while the Sheehan Company Case arose
under the Laws of 1922, c'.. 615, by which the amendment
(changed to subdivision 9) reduced the required payment
to five hundred dollars. The provisions are otherwise
identical. In March, 1921, an employee of the New York State
Railways sustained, in the course of his employnent, accidental injuries resulting in his death. He left no survivor. entitled to compensation. The State Industrial
; Board, in an-a-pprnpriateproceeding, awarded the State

Opinion of the Court.

Treasurer against the Railways, a " self-insurer ", the sum
of one hundred dollars, under subdivision 7 (now 8)2 of
ยง 15, for the total disability fund, and the. sum of nine
hundred dollars, under subdivision 8 (now 9), for the rehabilitation fund. The Railways did not appeal from the
award under subdivision 7. On successive appeals the
award under subdivision 8 was affirmed by the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals,
without opinions. 202 App. Div. 768; 233 N. Y. 681.
The record was remitted to the Supreme Court, to which
this writ of error was directed.
The Railways contend, as did the plaintiffs m error in
the Sheehan Company Case, that subdivision 8 (now 9)
of the Compensation Law and the award made thereunder, are in conflict with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This case is governed by the decision in the Sheehan
Company Case. The difference in the amount of the required payment to the rehabilitation fund does not change
the result. The amount required under the amendment
of 1920 was neither unjust nor unreasonable. "The sum
fixed in the statute is not great, is not larger than could
readily be awarded, had the deceased left dependentf:
There is no evidence

.

.

.

that the sum fixed is so

extravagant or arbitrary as to constitute an abuse of
power." Watkinson v. Hotel Pennsylvania, 195 App.
Div. 624, 627. And the aggregate of the required payments to the two special funds was then the same as that.
subsequeiitly required under the amendments of 1922;.
This subdivision- then required the employer, under the Laws of

1916, c. 622, to pay into the total disability fund, in the spebified
contingency, the sum of one hundred dollars; the amount being subsequently increased, under the Laws of 1922, e. 615, to five hundred
dollars.- See the opinion in the Sheehan Company Case, supra, note
