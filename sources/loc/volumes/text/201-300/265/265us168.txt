UNITED STATES EX RELATIONE THE BALDWIN
COMPANY v. ROBERTSON, AS COMMISSIONER
OF PATENTS, AND R. S. HOWARD COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 251. Argued April 29, 1924.-Decided May 26, 1924.
1. A decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia
directing dismissal of a bill for want of jurisdiction upon a construction of the Trade Mark Act, is reviewable here by appeal,
under Jud. Code, § 250. P. 176.
2. Under § 9 of the Trade Mark Act, the registrant of a trade-mark
who successfully resisted an application to cancel before the Commissioner but was defeated on his opponent's appeal to the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia, may maintain a bill under
Rev. Stats., § 4915, to enjoin the Commissioner from canceling the

registration. American Steel Fcundries v. Robertson, 262 U. S.
209. P. 177.
3. A bill brought under Rev. Stats., § 4915, to enjoin the Commissioner of Patents from canceling a trade-mark registration pursuant to a decision of the Court of Appeals, is not barred by Rev.
Stats., § 4894, where the delay beyond the period there prescribed
was justified by the taking of an appeal to this Court which was,
however, dismissed for want of jurisdiction. P. 181.
287 Fed. 942; 52 App. D. C. 368, reversed; certiorari denied.

United States, 233 U. S. 604; Chapman v. United States,
164 U. S. 436.
Section 4915, Rev. Stats., does not authorize this action.
It is a statutory provision to secure a purely statutory
right; that is, to secure a patent. Its language is unmistakably plain. As pointed out in Greenwood v. Dover,
194 Fed. 90, the section has come down to us without substantial change from the time when there was no review
by any court or judge of decisions of the Commissioner of
Patents. Its language goes back to the Patent Act of
1836, when there was first created a board of examiners.
In Butterworth v. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, and in United
States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, this Court summarized all
the instrumentalities provided by Congress since the
foundation of the Government for the granting of patents
and traced the development of appeals, viz:
In 1793 appeals might be taken to three arbitrators; in
1836 appeals might be taken to the Board of Examiners
bomposed of three disinterested persons whose decision
was to be certified to the Commissioner of Patents, who
"shall be governed thereby in further proceedings to be
had on such application," and remedy by bill in equity
was first provided; in 1839, somewhat modified in 1849
and 1852; appeal was provided from the Commissioner to
one of the judges of the Circuit Court of the District of
Columbia; in 1870 an appeal was provided from the decision of the Commissioner to the Supreme Court of the
District sitting in bane "whose decision was to govern
further proceedings in the case"; in 1893 appeals were
transferred from the Supreme Court of the District sitting
in bane to the Court of Appeals of the District, which is
the present status.
While Congress provided for the granting of patents
in 1790 (c. 7, 1 Stat. 109), it made no enactment in any
way relating to trade-marks until 1870, and no valid en-

actment prior to 1881. There is a wide and substantial
difference between patents and trade-marks. Butterworth v. Hoe, supra; Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82.
The registration of a trade-mark is solely a statutory
-privilege and the statutory limitations are strictly, con"strued.
By the Trade Mark Act, Congress granted .power to
cancel trade-mark registrations exclusively to the ComSmissioner of Patents, subject only to review
by the Court
to the Act
Columbia.
Prior
of-Appeals of the District of
of 1905, there 'was no provision for canceling a trademark registration, and there was no direct review, judicial
or administrative, by appeal or otherwise, of decisions of
the Commissioner upon matters relating to the registration of trade-marks. *South Carolina v. Seymour, 153
U. S. 353. No court has ever assumed the right to caneel a trade-mark registration, except the Court of Appeals
9f the District by the procedure expressly provided by
the Trade Mark Act itself. Section 13 of that act pro. vides for the cancellation of a trade-mark registration by
the Commissioner when the registrant was not- entitled
to the use of the trade-mark By §-9, appeal may be
taken from the Commissioner to the Court of Appeals of
the District.
The "use." referred to has been repeatedly held "to
mean the right of exclusive usee" Magic Curler Co. v.
Porter, C. D. 1907, 163. The remedy is full, fair and
summary, with appeal from the examiner to the Commissioner, and with no time limit for the application,
Plante v. Gedney, 224 Fed. 382.
Section 22 provides for the cancellation of trade-mark
registrations when there are interfering registrations by
suit in equity. This section corresponds to § 4918, Rev.
Stats., 'applicable to interfering patents. The Trade
Mark.Act fully provides for every case, both when the
Commissioner wrongfully refuses to register a trade-mark

"BALDWIN CO. v. ROBERTSON.
168

Argument for Appellees.

and when he erroneously grants registration. No trademark registration has ever been canceled under § 4915,
Rev. Stats.; no patent has ever been canceled under
§ 4915, Rev. Stats.
Except in the case of interfering patents, it is settled
law that patents for inventions may be canceled only by
the United States, and only under the general principles
of equity, and this right is solely within the power of the
United States. It has been settled that § 4915, Rev.
Stats., does not authorize an action to cancel a patent,
even by the United States. Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall.
434; United States v. Amric n Bell Tel. Co., 129 U. S.
315; Same v. Same, 159 U. S. 548; Bridgs v. United Shoe
Machinery Co., 239 U. S. 48.
To interpret § 4915 as authorizing the action at bar,
which is to enjoin the cancellation of a trade-mark registration, requires a rewriting of § 4915, and the incorporation into the section of both words and subject matter
entirely foreign to its present'plain language. Such an
interpretation "is not to be attained by striking out or
disregarding words that are in the section, but by inserting those that are not there now. This is no part of our
duty." Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82; Hill v. Wallace,
259 U. S. 44; United States v. Temple, 105 U. S.-97;
United States v. First Natl. Bank, 234 U. S. 245.
As far as counsel has been able to discover, there has
been only one decision which even touches the question
at bar, by any court, during the years since trade-marks
have been registered, and that was in the recent case of
Loughran v. Quaker City Chocolate Co., 286 Fed. 694,
in which the court held that § 4915, Rev. Stats., did not
authorize an action to cancel a trade-mark registration,
although it held that § 4915 authorized an application to
secure registration of a trade-mark.
It is rmspectfull submitted that Atkins & Co. v. Moore,

son, 262 U. S. 209, have no application, having to do
solely with securing the registration of a trade-mark,
while the case at bar has to do with the cancellation of a
registration; that is, to enjoin a cancellation.
If § 4915, Rev. Stats., does not authorize an action to
cancel a patent, much. less can it be interpreted to
authorize an action to cancel the registration of a mark;
and much less still to authorize an action to enjoin the
cancellation .of a registration of a mark which the Court
of-Appeals of the District has adjudged should be can-'
celed.
In Westinghouse Elec. Co. v. Ohio Brass Co. 186 Fed.
518, 520, which was an action for a patent under § 4915,
Rev. Stats., the court said: "The right tV retry the
merits of an application for a patent, by bill in equity,
.

.

.

is purely statutory, and is subject to such restric-

tions as Congress may prescribe."
The Supreme Court of the District is without cognizance of the class of cases to which this case belongs, without power to -adjudicate concerning the subject matter
here involved. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308; In re
Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200.
There is no presumption of jurisdiction where a court,
although one of general jurisdiction, is called upon. to
exercise special statutory powers, Galpin v. Page, 18
Wall. 350; nor is there ever any presumption that Congress intended to provide a. further review or a .retrial.
Ferry v. United States 85 Fed. 550: Reynolds v. Stockton, 140 U. S. 254.
Respondent contends that all provisions provided by
Congress for the cancellation of trade-mark registrations
are contained-in §§ 13 and 9 of the Trade Mark Act of
1905, and that these provisions are exclusive, whether regarded as judicial or administrative, except as provided
by § 22 of the act, which is applicable only when there
are interfering registrations.

BALDWIN CO. v. ROBERTSON.
168

Argument for AppeUee .

It is familiar doctrine that where a right, pri~ilege or
remedy is created by statute, the provisions of the statute
govern, limit and control ihe right or remedy and are
exclusive. Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corm Products Co., 236
U. S. 165.
By the Trade Mark Act itself Congress regulated the
whole subject of cancellation of trade-mark registrations,
which was a subject mater entirely within its control and
discretion, United States v. American Bell Tel. Co., 167
U. S. 224; United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, 589;
the provisions which C6ngress made are'comprehensive;
they embrace the whole subject; it is respectfully submitted that these provisions are exclusive.
It is plain that the cancellation provision "was a new
remedy" provided as a part of the registration statute
itself, "and as the mode of pursuing it was specially
pointed out, that mode must be pursued ", and that " the
remedy thus.prescribed is exclusive of all others ". Arnso v. Murphy, 109 U. S. 238; Middletown Natl. Bank v.
Toledo, etc., By. Co.,*197 U. S. 394; Cook County Bank
v. United Slates, 107 U. S. 445; Jackson v. Cra.vens,'238

220 U. S. 329; Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing
Co., 252 U. S. 436.
If the trade-mark registration statutes are to .be regarded as administrative provisions, the courts have no
jurisdiction to review their -quasi-judicial. decisions beyond what is expressly conferred by the Trade Mark Acts
themselves. Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., 261
U. S. 428; United States v. Duedl, 172 U. S. 576; Ness v.
Fisher, 223 U. S. 683; Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
149 U. S. 698.
If it be held that § 4915, Rev. Stats., authorizes this
action, it is respectfully submitted that the case at bar was
not brought in time.

It has been settled by the decisions of this Court that
an action under § 4915 must be brought within one year
from the date of the decision of the Court of Appeals of
the District in the Patent Office proceeding, unless excuse, " to the ,satisfaction of the court" is pleaded and
shown. None is here pleaded. Gandy v. Marble, 122

The appeals of the Baldwin Company to this Court,

Elec, Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., supra;McMillan Contrackingr
Cu. v. Abernathy, 263 U. S.438. Obviously, a litigant, by
choosing a wrong court or a wrong remedy, cannot continue a litigation indefinitely when. the statutes provide
otherwise, as might-be done if the time limit could be extended by selecting the'wrong court. If this could be
done, the statute which limits the time would be a dead
letter... Credit Co. v. •Arkansas CentralRy. Co., 128 U.S.
258, 261; Conboy v. FirstNati. Bank, 203 U. S. 141, 145;

As an action under § 4915, Rev. Stats., is "a part of the

Time'is reckoned from the date df. the decision of the

MR. CHMP JUsTICE Txr delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Baldwin Company filed its bill in the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia against the Commissioner of Patents, seeking to enjoin that officer from canceling two registrations of trademarks for pianos of
which the coinplainant claims to be the rightful owner.
The trademarks were one for the word "Howard", accompanied by the initials V. G. P. Co. arranged in a monogram dated March 8, 1898, .and the other the word
Howard printed or.impressed in a particular and distinctive manner dated October 17, 1905. The. R. S.
Howard Company came into the case as an intervener

and filed an answer denying the right of the eomplain-

265 U. S.

ant to continue to enjoy such registrations and resisting
the injunction to prevent the cancellation. The Cornmissioner of Patents as defendant also filed an answer
denying the right of the complainant to the relief sought*
The intervener also filed a motion to dismiss the bill for
lack of jurisdiction in the court to entertain it. The court
denied the motion to dismiss the bill and enjoined cancellation pending the final disposition of the cause. An appeal from this interlocutory order was taken under § 7 of
the Act -of February 9, 1593, establishing the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (27 Stat. 434, c. 74).
The Court of Appeals- reversed the Supreme Court and
remanded the cause with instructions to dismiss the bill.
Appeal to this Court was sought and allowed under § 250
of the Judicial Code, which provides as follows:
"Any final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals
of the District of Columbia may be reexamined and
affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of
the United States, upon writ of mror or appeal, in the
following cases:
"First. In cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial
court"is in issue; but when any such case is not otherwise reviewable in said Supreme Court, then the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to said Supreme Court for decision.
"Sixth. In cases in which the construction of any law
of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant."
The errors assigned were the holding that the Supreme
Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and
the direction to dismiss the bill on that account. In addition to the appeal, the appellee in the Court of Appeals
petitioned for a certiorari which is now pending.
As the decree of the Court of Appeals directs the dismissal of the bill for lack of jurisdiction, it is a final' de-

cree. Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S. 37, 44. As the court
based its conclusion upon the construction of § 9 of the
Trade Mark Act (33 Stat. 727), and § 4915, Rev. Stats.,
which was specifically drawn in question by the intervener, and necessarily by the defendant in.his answer in
denying the complainant's right to relief as claimed by
him in his bill under said two sections, we think the appeal was rightly allowed and that the petition for certiorari should be denied.
The controversy between the parties litigant has had
several phases. In August, 1914, R. S. Howard Company
sought to cancel the registration of the two trademarks of
Baldwin & Company, already referred to, by application
to the Commissioner. The Commissioner refused, but
upon appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District, the
decision of the Commissioner was reversed and this was
duly certified to the Commissioner. 48 App. D. C. 437.
The Baldwin Company appealed to this Court and filed
an application for a certiorari as welI. The appeal was
dismissed and the certiorari denied on the ground that
the certificate of the Court of Appeals to the Commissioner was not a final judgment, reviewable here upon appeal or certiorari. 256 U. S. 35. This was April 11,
1921, and on May 7, 1921, the Baldwin Company filed the
original bill in this case in the Supreme Court of the District against the Commissioner of Patents, seeking an injunction against the canceling of the trademarks in question. By an amended bill, there was set forth the record
in a suit between R. S. Howard Company and Baldwin
Company in New York, resulting in an injunction against
the use of the word Howard without prefix or suffix by
the R. S. Howard Company in sales of pianos. 233 Fed.

The main question we have here to consider is whether,

state and foreign trade, a remedy by bill in equity to enjoin the Commissioner of Patents from cancling a registered trademark is given to the owner of the trademark
so registered. We are to find the answer in § 9 of the
Trade Mark AMt (33 Stat.727, c. 592) and in § 4915 (dfthe.
Revised Statutes. Section 9 provides as follows:
" That if an applicant for registration of a trade-mpak,
or a party to an interference as to a trade-mark, or a
-party who has filed opposition to the registration of a
.trade-mark, or-party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark, is dissatisfied
with the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, he may
appeal to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia,
on complying with the conditions required in cae of an.
appeal from the decision of the Commisaioner by an applicant for patent, or a party to an interfereice- as to an
invention, and the same rules of practice and procedure
shall govern in every stage of su&h proceedings, as far as
the same may be applicable."
Section 4915,. Rev. Stats., providea as follows:
"Whenever a .patent on application is iefused; either
by the Commissioner of Patents or by the supreme court.
of the'Distrit of Columbia upon appeal from the Commi sioner, the applicant may have remedy by bill in
equity; and the court having cogiizance thereof, .on.notice to idverse parties and other due proceedings had;
may -adjudge that- such applicant is entitled, according
' td law, to receive a patent for his invention, as specified
in his claim, or for any part thereof, as the facts inthe'
case may appear.. And such adjudication, if it be in
favor of the right of the applicant, shall authorize -the
Commissioner to issue such patent on-the applicant filing
inthe Patent-Office a co1y of the adjudication, and other- wise complying with the requirements of- law.- In all
cases, -where there is no opposing party, a copy of the
bill shall be-served on the-Commissioner; and all the ex-

Opinion of the Court.

penses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant,
whether the final decision is in his favor or not."
We.have held that*the assimilation of the practice in
respect of the registration of trademarks to that in s&curing patents as enjoined by § ! of the Trade Mark Act
makes § 4915, Rev. Stats., providing for "abill in equity
to compel the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent,
applicable to a. petition for the registration of a trademark when rejected by the Commissioner. American
Steel Foundriesv. Robertson, 262 U. S. 209; Baldwin Co.
v. Howard Co., 256 U. S. 35, 39 ; Atkins & Co. v. Moore,,

212 U. S. 285, 291.
The present case presents this difference. The defeated party in tie hearing before the Commissioner is
not asking registration of a trademark but -is
seeking to
prevent the cancellation of trademarks already registered.
Section 9 provides for appeals to the District Court of
Appeals not only for a defeated applicant for registration
of a trademark, but also for a dissatisfied party to an interference as to a. trademark, a dissatisfied party who has
filed opposition to the registration of a trademark and a
dissatisfied party to an application for the cancellation
of the registration of a trademark. It seems clear -that
the complainant below was a dissatisfied party to an
application for the cancellation of the registration of a
trademark. We think that both the applicant for cancellation and the registrant opposing it are given the
right of appeal to the District Court of Appeals under
that section.
The next inquiry is whether, in addition to such appeal
and after it proves futile, the applicant is given'a remedy.
.by-billin equity as provided for a defeated applicant for
aipatent in. § 4915, Rev. Stats. We have in the cases cited
given the closing words of § 9 a liberal custruction-in the
view that Congress intended by them to give. every-

180

Opinion of the Court.

265 U. S.

remedy in respect to trademarks that is afforded in proceedings as to patents, and have held that under them a
bill of equity is afforded to a defeated applicant for trademark registration just as to a defeated applicant for a
patent. It is not an undue expansion of that construction to hold that the final words were intended to furnish a remedy in equity against the Commissioner in
every case in which by § 9 an appeal first lies to the Court
of Appeals. This necessarily would give to one defeated
by the Commissioner as a.party to an application for the
cancellation of the registration of a trademark, after an
unsuccessful appeal to the advisory supervision of the
Court of Appeals, a right to resort to an independent bill
in equity against the Commissioner to prevent canc'ellation.
It is pointed out, as niilitating against" our interpretation of § 9 and an assimilation of trademark procedure to
that in the case of .patents, that, after a patent issues,
there is no proceeding provided by which a patent can be
*canceled except on suit of the United States. Mowry v.
Whitney, 14 Wall. 434, 439; United States v. American
Bell Tel. Co., 128 U. S. 315, 368, 370; United States v.
America, Bell Tel. Co., 159 U. S. 548, 555; Brgg&v.
United Shod Machinery Co., 239 U. S. 48, 50. That is
true; but a registration of a trademark may be canceled,
and the purpose of Congress by § 9 of the Trade Mark Act
was tor give to defeated applicants in the Court of Appeals the same resort to a court of equity as was given to
defeated applicants for patents so far as the same was applicable. The applicant:- in § 9 were of four kinds and
to each of them were intended to be accorded the same
resort to the Court of Appeals and the same remedy in
equity as to the applicant for a patent in'§ 4915. The
inherent differences between trademarks- and patents
should not prevent our giving effect to the remedial purpose of Congress in carrying out the analogies between the
two classes of privileges to secure a common procedure.

BALDWIN CO. v. ROBERTSON.
168

Opinion of the Court.

The argument is made that § 9 should not be held to
authorize the use of a suit in equity for all of the four
cases in which appeals are provided to the Court of Appeals from the Oommissioner and are unsuccessful, because by § 22 of the same act there is a special provision
for a remedy in equity where there are interfering registered trademarks. It is said this excludes the inference
that such a remedy is also provided in §9, on the principle
expressio unius exclusio alterius. An examination of § 22
shows th&t it refers to an independent suit between claimants of trademarks both of which have already been registered. The Commissioner is not a party to such litigation but is subject to the decree of the court after it is
entered. It is just like the proceeding in §4918 to settlecontroversies between interfering patents already granted
by the Patent Office. Section 9 of the Trade Mark Act
is wider than § 22in its scole. Ii includes one who applies
for registration of an unregistered trademark which interferes with one already registered.
On the whole, we think that our decision in American
Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 262 U. S. 209, leads us
necessarily to sustain the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the District to entertain this bill.
Finally, it is objected that this bill was not in time. It
was filed more than two years and two months after the
decision 6f the Court of Appeals in the first appeal from
the Commissioner of Patents. It is contended that under
Gandy v. Marble,122 U. S. 432, § 4894 Rev. Stats. applies
to any bill in equity under § 4915 and compel the dismissal of the bill if it is not prosecuted within one year
after the adverse decision in the Court of Appeals, unltss it
appears to the satisfaction of the court that the delay was
unavoidable. 'In re Hien, 166 U. S. 432, 438; American
Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 262 U. S. 209, 212, 213.
There was here, however, justification for the delay, in the
appeal taken to this Court which was dismissed. 2.;

1. Section 37 of the Criminal Code (Rev. Stats., § 540) punishing
conspiracy to defraud .the United StAtes in any manner or fok
any purpose," does not embrace a conspiracy to defeat the pur-pose of the Selective Draft Act by inducing persons-to refuse to
register under it. P. 185.
2. To "defraud" the United States means to cheat the Government
out of property or money, or to interfere with or obstruct dne of
its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at
least by means that are dishonest. P. 188.
3. But mere open defiance of the governmental purpose to enforce a
law by'urging those subject to it to disobey it, is not a "fraud"
in this sense. Id. Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462, explained; Hor"wan v. United States; 116 Fed. 350, limited.
