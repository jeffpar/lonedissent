Statement of the Case.

This is to us so plain a proposition that it is unnecessary to
enlirge upon it.
Having no power to review on this writ any other question
than that of the jurisdiction of the court in the trial and sentence pronounced upon the verdict of guilty, and concluding
that there was the necessary jurisdiction, the order of the
Circuit Court refusing the writ of habeas corpus is
Affirmed.

OTIS ,COMPANY v. LUDLOW MANUFACTURING COMPANY.:
ERROR

TO THE

SUPERIOR

COURT OF

THE STATE

OF

MASSA-

CHUSETTS.
No. 73.

Argued March 1, 2, 1906.-Decided March i2, 1906.

Where the Federal question is distinctly set up in the bill, and insisted on
at every. stage,'and the state court could not have decided as it did without overruling the claim, this court has jurisdiction to review. the judgment on writ of error.
In determining whether a statute of a State is constitutional, this court
cannot wholly neglect the long-settled law and common understand;.
ing of that State, and will not, under the Fourteenth Amendment, upset
what has long been established and accepted. Even the incidents . of
ownership may be cut down by the peculiar laws and usages of a State.
Under the Massachusetts Mill Act the right of the lower owner only becomes complete when the land is flowed, and then it is only a right to
maintain a dam'subject to paying the upper owners for harm actually
done, in pursuance of the terms of the act. In a suit at equity brought
by the upper owner to restrain the lower owner from building a dam,
* the state court having declared generally that the Mill Act ,is valid, but
not having definitely expressed itself as to its constitutionality, and as the
opinion of this court may depend upon the interpretation of the act by
the .state court, held, that the bill should be dismissed without prejudice,
or retained until plaintiff's rights have been determined in an action for
damages under the statute pending in the state court.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mr. Boyd B. Jones, with whom Mr. Charles L. Gardiner and
Mr. John J. Winn were-on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Whether the state court considered or failed to consider the
Federal questions is immaterial. These questions were in fact
presented by the record and -argued by the plaintiff, and the
judgment in the case necessarily involved a decision of them.
A refusal or failure to consider a Federal question is equivalent
to a decision against the Federal right involved therein. Erie

The Mill Act, Mass. Pub. Sts. c. 190, authorizes depriving a
person of property without due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, -because, as interpreted by
the state court, it authorizes the taking of the property of
another without notice to the, owner thereof, by acts of occupation, like the making of the excavation in the present case,
so unintelligible and ambiguous as to utterly fail to indicate
how much of the property of the owner was or is to be taken,
or even that any of his property is to be injuriously affected.

This Mill Act is also unconstitutional because under its provisions one riparian owner is authorized, by an act of occupation of his land, to thereby acquire the right to flow the land
•of anupper proprietor, and at a later date to abandon such
taking without flowing and without liability to the upper proprietor for damages resulting from such taking,: and because
*it does not give the owner of property taken a right to compensation simultaneous with the taking; but makes such right dependent upon the future volition of the taker. - Pub. Stats.,
c. 190, § 4; Thompson v. Moore, 2 Allen, 350; Storm v. Manchaug Co., 13 Allen, 10;, Palmer Co: v. Ferrill, 17 Pick. 58.
An upper proprietor in such case is restricted in the use and
enjoyment of his land, between the commencement of occupation of. a mill-site and the abandonment thereof by another,
because he cannot improve his land without danger of loss of
the value of such improvements by floWage._ This liability to
loss is a prohibition against' the use and enjoyment of his land,
Which, unless just compensation be provided therefor, is unconstitutional. Re Wall St., 17 Barb. 617; Portland v. Lee

This Mill Act also violates the due process of law clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, because it authorizes the flowing
of the land of another and his consequent exclusion from the
use thereof for the time between the flowing and the filing and
recording of the verdict, usually a periodof at least two years,
without first requiring the payment of the damages caused during that period. Stuart v. Palmer, 74 N. Y. 183; Montana

the effect *thatan interference with the rights of a landowner,
which forces him either to have his lands flowed by a lower

The Mill Acts of Massachusetts, Pub. Stats., c. 190, are in accord with the constitution of that Commonwealth, and have
been assumed to be so by the highest court of the State for
more than one hundred years without dispute.
In cases where the question has been directly raised, the
validity of the statutes known as the."Mill Acts" has been
sustained and they have been declared constitutional. Murdock v. Stickney, 8 Cush. 113; Hazen v. Essex Company, 12

Anne, c. 8.
They were enacted to enhance the wealth of the Commonwealth, for the public welfare, for the promotion of and increase of industries and manufactures, and incidentally for the
discouragement of controversies between riparian proprietors
and for the regulation of the rights of property owners upon
streams adaptable for power purposes.

No title to the land flowed is acquired by: a lower pr6prietor
under this Mill Act, and no land is taken thereby. The landowner cannot obtain damages for an alleged i'estriction on the
use of .his land by the contemplated raising of the.water thereon
or thereover, until the flowage caused by the raising of the
waters of the stream by the dam of the lower prokrietor actually takes place.
It is also true that before the water is raised by the dam of
the lower proprietor, the upper proprietor may dike, embank
or dig canals on his own land. See Williams v. Nelson, 23

MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity to restrain the defendants in error
from flooding the plaintiff's land by means of a dam erected
under the Massachusetts Mill Act. The injunction is asked
on alternative grounds-either that the Mill Act does not
authorize the dam, or that, if it does, then it is contrary to the
Fourteenth Amendment of the. Constitution of the United
States. The case was tried in the Superior Court and reported
to the Supreme Judicial Court, which held that the statute authorized the dam and was valid, and ordered the bill be dismissed. 186 Massachusetts, 89. A decree was entered in
accordance with the rescript and the case then was brought
here. The claim under the ponstitution was distinctly set up

OTIS CO. v. LUDLOW CO.
201 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

in the bill, and was insisted on at every stage. The court could
not have decided as it did without overruling that claim, so that
the jurisdiction of this court is clear, although it was denied.
The dam in question is, built across the Chicopee River, a
non-navigable stream, at Red Bridge. It was begun, in pursurance of a long previous determination, on August 3, 1899,
and was completed within a reasonable time. The plaintiff
owned a mill and dam, more than two miles above, and land
below its dam on the two sides of the watercourse, down to
within about two miles from the principal defendant's dam.
On April 4, 1900, the plaintiff determined to build a dam near
its lower boundary, and began the work of construction on
August 11 of the same year. This dam was completed before,
although it was begun after, the defendants', and will be
rendered nearly or wholly useless by the back flow from the
defendants' structure. The plaintiff's original dam and mill
will not be interfered with. The Supreme Judicial Court decided that under the statute then in force, Pub. Stats., c. 190,
§2, the principal defendant, herein called the defendant, acquired the prior right, and that the statute was constitutional.
It postponed the consideration of the plaintiff's rights in reference to damages, but decided that the provision for compensation was adequate to satisfy whatever rights the plaintiff
might have.
The only question which it is necessary for us to consider

is whether the act as construed violates the Fourteenth Amendment.-General objections to Mill Acts as taking property
for private use or on other grounds have been disposed of by

ings and warnings one miller to each grist mill; act of 1693,

But at all events, the liability of streams to this kind of appropriation and use has become so familiar a conception in
New England, where water power plays as large a part as
mines in Utah, that it would not be very extravagant to say
that it enters as an incident into the nature of property in
streams as there understood.
However, the liability of upper land to be flowed is not a
liability to be flowed without payment. The principal objection made to the law is that it makes no adequate provision
for payment, if it is construed as it has been construed by the
state court. There has been no substantial change in the form
of this provision for the better part of a century. It reads:
"A person whose land is overflowed or otherwise injured by
such dam,. may obtain compensation therefor upon his complaint before the superior court for the county where the land
or any part thereof lies; but no compensation shall be awarded
for damages sustained more than three years before, the institution of the complaint." Pub. Stats., c. 190, § 4. The
jury is to take into consideration damage to other land as
well as the damage to the land overflowed. Section 14. It
is to assess .the damages sustained within three years, § 16,
and to determine what sum, to be paid annually, would be
reasonable compensation for the damages that may be occasioned thereafter, and also a sum in gross for all damages
from .the use of the dam in the manner fixed by it, § 18, the
jury having power to regulate the height of the dam. Section
17. The complainant is given an election to take the gross sum,
in which case the owner of the dam loses all beiefit of the act
after three months until he pays. Sections 19, 20.. Otherwise
the complainant has an action for the annual compensation
and a lien on the dam and lands used with it. Section. 21 et
seq. And, finally, if dissatisfied with the amount of the annual
compensation, he may bring a new complaint. Section 30.

OTIS CO. v. LUDLOW CO.
201 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In considering whether these provisions are sufficient it is
important to know exactly what the upper owner loses by the_
dam. The state court lays it 'down that there is no taking
under the right of eminent domain.' 186 Massaehusetts, 95.
We assume this to mean what often has been said with regard
to the Mill Acts, that under them no easement or title of any
kind is gained in or over the upper land, and that the water
could be diked out, Storm v. Manchaug Co., 13 Allen 10, 13;
Lowell V. Boston, '1il Massachusetts, 454, 466; although the
language has not been uniform and it seems to have been held
otherwise when the damages are paid in gross. Isele v. Arlington Five Cents Savings Bank, 135 Massachusetts, 142. Taking
the law to be as stated by the court, it would follow that only
the damage physically suffered is to be paid for. When a title
is taken, for instance, to the waters of a stream, it is held that
the whole value of the title must be paid, although a consider'able use may be left in fact to the party aggrieved. Howe v.
Weymouth, 148 Massachusetts, 605; Imbescheid v. Old Colony
Railroad Co.,' 171 Massachusetts, 209. Flowage under the
Mill Acts seems to be regarded as presenting the converse case.
As no title is gained to have the water on the upper land, the
dam owner pays only for the harm actually done from time
to time. Ifthis is so,. 'somewhat less elaborate provisions
might be justified 'than could be sustained when the title is lost.
So far as security goes, looking to the reasonable probabilities
in such cases, it would seem to be sufficient. We must bear in
mind, as we presume the state court meant to suggest by its
citation of the case of Brickett v. Haverhill Aqueduct Co., 142
Massachusetts, 394, 397, that, as was said there in words that
need but little 'change, if other remedies proved ineffectual,
..the "court would, by proceedings in equity, restrain, the defendant from a further use of the water, and, if necessary,
order the removal of the dam." In other words, the right to
an injunction, if necessary, is taken into account in Massachusetts, in deciding whether the security for payment is sufficient, even when there is a taking by eminent domain. See

also Attorney General v. Old Colony Railroad, 160 Massachusetts,.
62, 90; Manigault v. Springs, 199 U. S. 473, 485, 486. This
seems an answer to the objection that in the state of the
business of the courts a judgment for past damages may not
be recorded for several years, that the defendant may be insolvent, the dam inadequate security, and valuable improvements destroyed. It is said that the lower owner might abandon his dam and thereby escape liability for gross damages
after an election to take them. But we presume that in that
case he would be held to pay the temporary damage caused
and the case would stand like one where the choice had been
.
the other way. Hunt v. Whitney, 4. Met. 603, 608.
Again, we cannot wholly neglect the long settled law and
common understanding of a particular State in considering
the plaintiff's rights. We are bound to be very cautious in
coming to the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment
has upset what thus has been established and accepted for a
long time. Even the incidents of ownership may be cut down
by the peculiar laws and usages of a State. Eldridge v. Trezevant, 160 U. S. 452, 466. For a century the remedy given by
the statute has been supposed to be sufficient, and in 1832 it
was decided to be so under a somewhat similar statute which
was held to create a' servitude. Boston & Roxbury Mill Corporation v. Newman, 12 Pick. 467. We are not prepared to
pronounce the statute void on the ground that the security
for payment is not enough.,
But it is argued that not all the serious damage which is,
or may be, suffered is compensated. It is said that only damages caused by flowing can be recovered. But the cases cited
only show that damages regarded as too remote on general
principles are disallowed, Fuller v. Chicopee Manufacturing
Co., 16 Gray, 46, or that not being within the protection of
the Mill Acts they are to be recovered by an action at common
law. Eames v. New England Worsted Co., 11 Met. 570. And
the statute now expressly provides for a "person whose land
is overflowed or otherwise injured," § 4, and that the jury

OTIS CO. v. LUDLOW CO.
201 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

shall take into consideration any damage occasioned to other
land as well as that to the land overflowed. Section 14. A
graver doubt is raised by another argument. It is decided that
the prior right is gained by the dam first begun, provided it
is completed and put in operation within a reasonable time.

If, as in the present case, the upper owner builds a dam in the
meantime, it may be held that he is entitled to no compensation
for its being rendered useless, even if he builds without notice
of the earlier appropriation, as well might happen. On the
other hand if he refrains from using his land as he desires, he
may be denied compensation for being deprived of the use of
his land. We do not perceive why the latter' result should
follow.: As to the former it may be held that, notwithstanding the priority of the lower owner, the upper owner has a
right to improve his land until it actually is flowed. Otherwise the former might have it in his power to keep the latter
in suspense for a year or two and then abandon his- dam.
.Because the plaintiff was too late to prohibit the defendant's
dam it does not follow that it may not be entitled to all the
damages which it'suffers when the flowing takes place. That
it would be entitled to them perhaps may be inferred from
Baird v.. Wells, 22 Pick. 312, decided under a different statute
but .still applicable so. far as -this principle is concerned. See
further Storm v. Manchaug Co., 13 Allen, 10, 15; Edwards v.
Bruorton, 184 Massachusetts, 529, 532.
The state court has confined itself to a general declaration
that the act is valid and has not expressed itself definitely
upon these points. Yet our opinion upon the constitutional
question may depend upon its interpretation of the statute in
a case which could not be brought here. Obviously it would
be unjust that the plaintiff should be concluded upon a doubtful construction assumed by us which the state court hereafter
may not adopt. Therefore it seems to us proper that this bill
should be dismissed without prejudice, or retained until the
plaintiff's rights shall have been determined in the proceedings
for damages under the statutes, which it is admitted have been

brought. The objection to the act on the ground of want of
notice does not impress us except in its bearing upon the point
just mentioned. The right- of the lower owner only becomes
complete when tfie land is flowed, and, as, even then, it is
not a right to maintain the water. upon the plaintiff's land,
but merely a right to maintain the dam subject to paying for
the harm actually done, we see nothing to complain of in that
.regard.

COMPANY, PETITIONER.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS.
No. 17, Original.

Argued February 19, 1906-Decided March 19, 1906.

Plaintiffs brought suit upon a single Oatent, in which there were twelve
claims. The Circuit Court found that three of the claims were invalid
and nine valid, of which five had been infringed, and referred it to a
master to report the amount of damages and dismissed the bill as to the
claims found invalid and not infringed. Defendants appealed from the
decree and plaintiffs also filed cross appeal assigning as errors the rulings
adverse to them. The Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the cross appeal. Petition for mandamus to compel that court to take jurisdiction
of the cross appeal denied and held, that:
The decree was interlocutory and not final and in the Federal courts no
appeal can as a general rule be taken except from a final decree.
The appeal authorized by J 7 of the act of March 3, 1891, does not bring
up the cause as a wh6le; and, unless otherwise specially ordered, the
case, except for hearing of the appeal from the interlocutory order,
proceeds in the lower court as though no appeal had been taken until
final judgment.
Cases in which a bill has been dismissed as to some of the defendants and
a separable controversy as to others referred to a master for an accounting, and in which the dismissal has been treated as a final decree, have
no application to a case of joint liability, or in which there is only a single
defendant.

IN March, 1903, the petitioners filed their bill in the Circuit
