public improvements.. Chicago v. Taylor, 125 U. S. 161;
Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., 233 U. S. 546, 554.
Others have, in authorizing specific public improvements,
conferred the right to such compensation.' Ettor v.
Tacoma, 228 U. S. 148; Joslin Manufacturing Co. v.
Providence, 262 U. S. 668.. Congress had, of course, the
power to make like provision here. Compare United
States v. Realty Co., 163 U. S. 427. But the mere reference in the appropriation clause to losses "resulting from
the procurement of the land for this purpose" does not
confer such a right. The settled policy of Congress, in
authorizing the taking of land and appurtenances, has
been to limit the right to compensation to interests in the
land taken. The only act called to our attention in which
was conferred a right to compensation for injury to property other than an interest in the land taken is the statute
involved in United States v. Alexander, 148 U. S. 186,
which wag passed more than forty years ago, and in which
the injury provided for was a direct result of the taking.
We need not consider other objections to a recovery.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Claims which dismissed the petition on demurrer. The
plaintiff owns a short-line railroad which it operated, but
which is alleged to have been under federal control from
January 1 to July 1, 1918. The suit was brought to recover, for that period, amounts representing the deficit
in operating income, under maintenance of way and
equipment charges, and the rental value of the property,

which are claimed under ยง 3 of the Federal Control Act,
March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 454. There was annexed to the petition as an exhibit the copy of a contract
between the plaintiff and the Director General of Railroads, dated February 26, 1919. It deals, in the main,
with the mutual relations of the parties for the period
after July 1, 1918, but section 3, of the contract provides
as follows:
"The Company . . . expressly accepts the covenants and obligations of the Director Gendral in this
agreement set out and the rights arising thereunder in full
adjustment, settlement, satisfaction, and discharge of any
and all claims and rights at law or in equity, which it now
has or hereafter can have against the United States, the
President, the Director General or any agent or agency
thereof by virtue of anything done or omitted, pursuant
to the acts of Congress herein referred to.
"This is not intended to affectany claim said Company
may have against the United States for carrying the mails
.or for other services rendered not pertaining to or based
upon the Federal Control Act."
The acts of Congress referred to in the contract were
the Federal Control Act, the Act of August 29, 1916, c.
418, 39 Stat. 619, 645, and the Joint Resolutions. of April
6, 1917, and December 7, 1917, 40 Stat. 1, 429. The
Government assigned as a ground of demurrer that the
copy of the contract annexed to the petition showed that
the claims sued on had b~en settled and that the United
States had been released from any liability to the plaintiff.
The petition alleges, among other things, "that section
3 thereof does not contain and was not intended. to contain any receipt or acknowledgment of any consid etion
by or in favor of the plaintiff for the use of said railroad
property during said six months from January 1 to July
1, 1918; ' that the section refers only to other provisions;,

and that the "plaintiff gained nothing by the execution of
this contract, and by it no rights were lost." The contention is that these allegations are admitted by the demurrer; and that for this and other reasons sectiofi 3
can not properly be construed to apply to claims of the
character of those sought to be recovered, because these
"did not arise out of the contract or becauseof anything
contained in it." The allegations in the petition as to the
meaning, applicatign and effect of section 3, being conclusions of law, are not admitted by the demurrer. United
States v. Ames, 99 U. S. 35, 45; Chicot County v. Sherwood, 148 U. S. 529, 536; Equitable Life Assurance
Society/v. Brown, 213 U. S. 25, 43. The legal effect of the
instrument remains that which its language,imports. Interstate Land Co. v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., 139 U. S.
569, 578. The contract here in question appears to have
been carefully drawn. It is the standard form short-line
or co-operative contract said to have been executed by
more than a hundred railroads.1 The language employed
in section 3 to embody the agreement for settlement and
release of claims is so clear and comprehensive as to leave
on its face no room for construction. United States v.
Win. Cramp & Sons Co., 206: U. S. 118, 128. And we do
not find in any other part of the contract any provision
which prevents the application of the release clause to the
claims here in suit.
There is no contention that the contract as written does
not express the actual agreement, nor a prayer that, because of mutual mistake, it should be reformed. The
petition contains allegations which indicate that originally itwas intended to challenge the validity of the contract because of duress, lack of consideration and want of
power in the Director General to enter into the same.
For the form of the cooperative contract, see United States Railroad Administration, Director General of Railroads, Bulletin No. 4
(revised), 1919, p. 80; Report of the Director General, 1924, pp. 36-38.

But the plaintiff's brief declares that the sole question before the Court is' whether section 3 of the contract is a
settlement or waiver of the claim in suit. And more specifically: "It is not alleged nor now claimed that the contract was wholly and absolutely void because of total lack
of consideration, or because the same was executed under
forceable and legal duress.". Any claim based on a lack of
authority in the Director General is clearly unfounded.
There is in the brief a suggestion that the lower court
erred in giving effect to section 3 because "the contract
was set out as an exhibit to the petition not as a part
thereof, but merely for the purpose of showing to the
court that the cause of action set out in the petition
.

.

.

[was] entirely independent of and arose outside

of the contract itself." The suggestion is unsubstantial.
Ordinarily the defense of release or accord and satisfaction must be pleaded in bar. But where the fact appears
either in the body of the petition, or from an exhibit annexed, the defense may be availed of on demurrer. Compare Randall v. Howard, 2 Black, 585, 589; McClure v.
'Township of Oxford, 94 U. S. 429, 433; Speidel v. Henrici,
