lines at 50 per cent. of the tariff rates. Two of appellant's lines of railroad in Minnesota were constructed by
the aid of land granted by an Act of Congress of July 4,
1866, § 3, c. 168, 14 Stat. 88. Appellant made no charges
for the shipments: that moved over these lines. Appellant alleged that when it received and transported such
freight it believed it belonged to the United States, and
had no intimation that the shipments were private property until the latter part of 1916. , The Court of Claims
held that all the shipments belonged to the United States,
and that it was entitled to transportation of its property
at 50 per cent. of the tariff rates on the aided lines first
above referred to and to free transportation on those last
mentioned, and found that it was not shown whether appellant was informed as to the title to the property.
The court further found that in every instance appellant made out and presented freight bills to the Government for the net charges after making proper land
grant deductions, and that the payment of the full amount
so claimed was made and accepted without protest. Appellant is not entitled to recover. Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, decided this day, ante, p..

a .judgment of the Court of Appeals of

Missouri affirming, with a reduction, a judgment for treble
damages recovered by Stroud from the Railroad Company, under Rev. Stats. Mo. §§ 9985, 9990, for discrimination in furnishing freight cars.
Mr. Thomas T. Railey for petitioner. Messrs. Edw. J.
White, Jas. F. Green, and J. C. Sheppard, were on the
brief.
Mr. George H. Moore, for respondent, submitted.
MP_ JUsTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This action was brought by the respondent against the
petitioner in the Circuit Court of Ripley County, Missouri, to recover treble damages under .. § 9985, 9990, Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1919. The petitioner is a
common carrier of freight and passengers for hire by railroad in Missouri and other States. Section 9985 cgntains the following: "It shall be unlawful for any such
common carrier to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person
in the transportation" of goods . . . or to
subject any particular person . . . to any undue or
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to
such transportation
.
" Section 9990, among other
things, makes the carrier liable to any person injured by a
violation of the above quoted provision for three' times
the amount of damages sustained.
. June 12, 1920, respondent, who was engaged in the
lumber business, had 20,000 feet of hardwood lumber

ready for shipment at Oxly, Missouri, a station on petitioner's railroad, and applied for two cars on which to
ship the lumber to Saint Louis, Missouri. The petitioner
failed to furnish him any cars until August 19, 1920.
After he had ordered the cars, and before they were delivered, other shippers at Oxly applied to the petitioner
for, and were furnished, cars for-the transportation of
lumber. Respondent alleged that by § 9985 petitioner
was prohibited from so discriminating against him, and
that as a result of such unlawful discrimination he was
damaged in the sum of $1,000. The complaint alleged
the foregoing facts, but contained no allegation that respondent attempted to designate aLy route, intrastate or
interstate, for the transportation of his lumber. The answer denied the discrimination and alleged that petitioner
moves its cars from Oxly to Saint Louis over two routes:
one wholly within the State of Missouri; the other by
way of Thebe's, crossing the Mississippi River at that
point and running through the State of Illinois into Saint
Louis; that the usual and regular way of routing cars
loaded with lumber at Oxly and consigned to Saint Louis
would be over the latter route through the State of Illinois and would be interstate commerce, and that § 9985
has no application to the facts stated in respondent's
complaint.
The first trial resulted in a judgment for respondent
which was reversed on appeal. 210 Mo. App. 311. However, the Court of Appeals held that, under these sections,
an action lies for damages for discrimination in furnishing cars for the shipment of lumber which could have gone
over either an intrastate or interstate route. At the
second trial, petitioner's superintendent of transportation testified that, under the routing circular then in
force, respondent's lumber would have been hauled over
the interstate route; that the line on the Missouri side
of the river passes over Iron Mountain and other Ozark

hills, and that the routing through Illinois over the more
level line is made as a matter of operating convenience
and economy. There was no other evidence on the point.
Cf. 210 Mo. App. 316. Respondent did not attempt to
designate any route, intrastate or interstate, and there is
nothing to show that he expressed or had any preference
in respect of the route. At the close of all the evidence
in the case, the petitioner requested the court to instruct
the jury to return a verdict for petitioner. The court refused to do so, and, notwithstanding the fact that respondent's lumber would have moved over the interstate
route, submitted the case to the jury. There was a verdict of $1,000 for respondent, and judgment was entered
for three times that amount. Petitioner appealed. 212
Mo. App. 512. The Court of Appeals held' that respondent was not entitled to a verdict in excess of
$502.50, and ordered that, if respondent filed remittitur,
judgment for $1,507.50 would be affirmed. The remit-'
titur was filed and judgment entered accordingly. The
case is here on certiorari. .§ 237, Judicial Code.
Congress, in the exertion of its power over commerce
among the States, has enacted laws for the regulation of
the furnishing of ears to shippers. Interstate Commerce
Act, § 1, (3), (4), (6), (10), (11), (12), (14); .§ 3 (1);
§15 (1). See United States v. New River Company, 265
U. S. 533, 541. Section 3, c. 104, 24 Stat. 380 (as
amended February 28, 1920, § 405, c. 91, 41 Stat. 479) is
very similar to § 9985, and contains the following: "That
it shall be unlawful for any common carrier 'subject to
the provisions -of this act to make or give any undue or
unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular
person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or for any
particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm,
corporation, or locality, or any particular description of
traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or dis-

advantage in any respect whatsoever." It is elementary
and well settled that there can be no divided authority
over interstate commerce, and that the acts of Congress
on that subject are supreme and exclusive. Transportation from Oxly to Saint Louis over the route partly within
and partly outside of Missouri is interstate commerce.

by that r6ute. The record discloses n6 facts which would
impose upon petitioner any obligation to haul respondent's lumber over the intrastate route. See Northern
Pacific Ry Co. v. Solum, 247 U. S. 477, 482. The state
law has no application to the furnishing of cars to shippers for the transportation of freight in interstate commerce. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. v. Hardwick
