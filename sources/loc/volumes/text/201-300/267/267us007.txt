do not imply, we shall leave that for further consideration

as stopped at the outset by Want of jurisdiction. In that
we think it erred.

States, as a part of the net impounded funds derived from

who presented claims for reimbursement out of the proceeds of' well 139 (known as the Burke-Senator well)
for the cost of drilling that well prior to the receivership
shall adjust the differences between them and accept reimbursement as contemplated in paragraph 13 of the
order of June 9, 1924, they are directed to show cause,
within five days after the expiration of that period, why

National Bank of Wichita Falls, Texas, 1/6 of the said
balance-the 27/96 to be held by Rhea S. Nixon, as receiver and trustee, to await the outcome of litigation now
pending in the courts of Texas to determine the rights of
those who are claiming interests therein, and the 1/6 to
be held by the Security, National Bank to await the outcome of litigation now pending in those courts to determine the rights of those who'are claiming interests therein.
7. The motion of the State of Texas presented January
16, 1925, for leave to file a claim for a royalty or owner's
interest in a part of the impounded funds in the receiver's
custody,is denied,-because, as appears from the receiver's
thirteenth report before mentioned, no claim thereto was
presented by that State within the period prescribed by
paragraph 18 of the order of June 9, 1924, because that
period has long since expired, and because to permit such
a claim by the State to be presented and entertained at
this time would unreasonably prolong the receivership
and would be inequitable to other claimants whose claims
were seasonably presented.

derived from Wells 152, 153, 154, 157, 159, 160,162,165,169,

of the order of June 9, 1924, and reported in his thirteenth
report before mentioned, are referred .to Joseph M. Hill,
Esquire, of Fort Smith, Arkansas, as a special master,

bearing on such claims and report the same to the court,
together with his findings of 'fact, conclusions of law and
recommendations in- the premises, for the ultimate consideration and action of the court. The evidence shall
be taken at Wichita Falls, Texas, and the taking thereof
shall begin February 16, 1925, and shall proceed with
reasonable expedition and be concluded not later than
March 7, 1925. The report of the special masier shall be

filed with the clerk within thirty days after the evidence
is taken, and shall be printed by the clerk. Claimants
shall have fifteen days after the filing of the report within
which to prepare, print and file exceptions to it accompanied by supporting briefs. The special master shall

this cause without procuring new exemplifications thereof
or presenting other proof of their authenticity or identification. The special master shall receive an allowance
covering his actual expenses and a reasonable compensation for his service. This allowance, together with the
cost of his stenographic and clerical assistance and the
cost of-printing his report, shall be charged against and
be borne by the several claimants in such proportions and
in such manner as the court hereafter may direct. Each
claimant, however, shall make. to the clerk an advance
payment of fifty dollars towards such costs within twenty
days from this date; and in default thereof the claimant
shall be deemed to have abandoned his claim.
9" If, before the time fixed for taking evidence under
the last paragraph, the several conflicting claimants to
any particular fund make and present to the receiver a
stipulation adjusting their differences and settling their
rights to such fund, or providing that the fund shall be
paid over to a trustee of their selectiomi to await an adjustment or adjudication of their claims through some
medium other than this court, the receiver shall be authorized to give effect to such stipulation and to pay over the
fund as therein provided, and -the stipulation shall operate to withdraw the claims covered by it from the
