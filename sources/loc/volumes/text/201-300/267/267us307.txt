BUCK v. KUYKENDALL.
302

Syllabus.

As the record contains no bill of exceptions, upon this
direct writ of error we can review only questions of law apparent on the face of the pleadings in so far as they directly relate to the court's jurisdiction. Insurance Company v. Folsom, 18 Wall. 237; Law v. United States,
266 U. S. 494; Judicial Code, § 238.
Jurisdiction was invoked under the Lever Act. The
claim is for something alleged to have been commandeered or requisitioned by. the President, as provided by § 10, and this section confers jurisdiction without qualification upon district courts to hear and determine controversies directly resulting from such action.
Houston Coal Co. v. United States, -62 U. S. 361, 365.
Proceedings in the district where the'seizure actually occurred are not forbidden, and seem entirely appropriate.
The allegations of the complaint were sufficient to set
out a substantial claim under a federal statute. Accordingly, there was jurisdiction in the court to pass upon the
questions so presented. Bind-erup v. Pathe Exchange, 263
U. S. 291, 305.
Affirmed.

BUCK v. KUYKENDALL, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 345.

Argued November 25, 1924.-Decided March 2, 1925.

1. Section 4, of c. 111, Laws of Washington, 1921, which prohibits
common carriers for hire from using the highways-by auto vehicles between fixed'Oinini or over regular routes without having
obtained from the Director of Public Works a certificate declaring
that public conveniefice a

primarily, not a regulation to secure safety on highways, or to
conserve them, but a prohibition of comoetition, and, as applied
to one desirous of using the highways as a common carrier of pas-

APPEAL from a decree of the District Court dismissing
a bill for an injunction. See 295 Fed. 197; id. 203. The
opinion is printed as amended by order, June 8, 1925.

Mr. Merrill Moores, with whom Mr. W. R. Crawford
was on the briefs, for appellant, submitted.
The Federal Highway Act and the adoption of the provisions thereof by the State of Washington constitute a
contract protected by the Federal Constitution. The
provisions of the state law, c. 111, of the Laws of 1921,
as amended, preventing unimpeded traffic on federal-aided
highways or granting an exclusive privilege to use them
in certain traffic, impair this contract and are unconstitutional. They create a monopoly; they discriminate
against and prohibit the free use of these highways for
traffic. 'McGehee v. Mathis, 4 Wall. 145; Seabright v.
Stokes et al., 3 How. 151; Neil, Moore & Co. v. Ohio, 3
How. 720; Achison v. Hudleson, 12 How. 291.
In § 2 of the federal act the term "reconstruction" was
defined as including the widening or rebuilding of highways or any portion thereof, to make a continuous road
sufficiently wide and strong to care adequately for "traffic" needs.
Section 8 provides that such highways must be built to
adequately meet existing and probable future" "traffic"
needs and conditions. Further, the Secretary of Agriculture must approve the types and width, and consideration
must be given probable character and extent of future
"traffic."

BUCK v. KUYKENDALL:
307

Argument for Appellant.

. Section 18 vests the Secretary with sole authority to
administer the law, protecting the highways and the
safety of "traffic" thereon.
Interstate commerce consists of intercourse and traffic
between the citizens of different States.
The term " traffic" is not one of restriction, but em-.
braces all uses of such public highways by any means or
instrument of transportation, whether or not there is a
charge for the use of the means or instruments by the
owner thereof to others for transportation.
If § 4 of the state law, prohibiting the use of such
public highways, except by one person or corporation in
the same territory using such highway, is constitutional,
then the State can prohibit the free use of such highways
by any class either of motor vehicles or of persons,
and the entire meaning of the Federal Highway Act
and the protection thereof chn be destroyed and a
favored few would have absolute monopoly in "traffic"
thereon.
The provision of the state law requiring a 'certificate
or license to engage in interstate commerce, is unconstitutional. McCall v. California, 136 U. S. 104; Gloucester
Ferry Co. v. Penn., 114 U. S. 196; Crandall v. Nevada,

17 Wall. 560; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U.
S. .525; Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States,
263 U. S. 456.
A state law requiring the obtaining of a license to
engage in interstate commerce in the State is unconstitutional and can not be defended as a police measure.

Wash. 441.
A state law granting an exclusive privilege to engage
in the business of interstate commerce over the public
highways is unconstitutional. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1; .Long v. Miller, 262 Fed. 363; Pensacola Tel.
Co. v. West. Union Tel. Co., 96 U. S. 1; United States

Etc. Co., 192 U. S. 454.
The provisions of the state law are arbitrary and void.
The appellant was prohibited from entering the State
of Washington, carrying persons from Portland, Oregon,
at reduced fares.
It is claimed that these provisions are constitutional
on the ground that Congress has not legislated on the
subject. We contend that the "Federal Highway Act,"
furnishes a complete answer.
Even if that Act had no application, the inaction of
Congress is equivalent to a declaration that such interstate commerce shall remain free and untrammeled. Missouri v. Kansas City Nat. Gas. Co. 265 U. S. 298; Penn.
v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553; Wabash St. L. & P. R.
Co. v. Illinois, 118 U. S. 557; South Covington Ry. v.
Covington, 235 U. S. 538.
The power vested in Congress to regulate commerce
among the States cannot be stopped at the boundary line
of the State, and the absence of a law by Congress is
equivalent to its declaration that the importation of
the article of commerce into the States shall be
unrestricted. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100; Lyng v.

It. has been repeatedly recognized by this Court that in
matters affecting interstati commerce the States may legislate with reference to local needs where there has been no

This is an appeal, under § 238 of the Judicial Code,
from a final decree of the federal court for western Washington dismissing a bill brought to enjoin the enforcement•
of § 4 of chapter 111 of the Laws of Washington, 1921.
That section prohibits common cariers for hire from
using the highways by auto vehicles between fixed termini
or over regular routes, without having first obtained from
the Director of Public Works a certificate declaring that

Opinion of the Court.

public convenience and necessity require such operation.
The highest court of the State has construed the section
as applying to common carriers engaged exclusively in
interstate commerce. NorthernPacificRy. Co.v. Schdenfetdt, 123 Wash. 579; Schmidt v. Department of Public
Works, 123 Wash. 705.. The main question for decision
is whether the statute so construed and applied is consistent with the Federal Constitution and the legislation
of Congress.
Buck, a citizen of Washington, wished to operate an
auto stage line over the Pacific Highway between Seattle,
Washington and Portland, Oregon, as a common carrier
for hire exclusively for through interstate passengers and
express. He obtained from Oregon the license prescribed
by its laws. Having complied with the laws of Washington relating -to motor vehicles, their owners and drivers
(Carlsenv. Cooney, 123 Wash. 441), and alleging willingness to comply with all applicable regulations concerning common carriers, Buck applied there for the prescribed
certificate of public convenience and necesity. It was
refused: The ground of refusal was that, under the laws
of the State, the certificate may not be granted for any
.territory which is already being adequately served by the
holder of a certificate and that, in addition to frequent
steam railroad service, adequate transportation facilities
between Seattle and Portland were already being provided by means of four connecting auto stage lines, all ofwhich held such certificates from the State of Washington.' Re Buck, P. U. I. 1923 E, 737. To enjoin interference by its officials with the operation of the projected
'An additional ground for refusing the certificate was that the
applicant did not appear to have financial ability. This ground of
rejection does not require separate consideration; among other
reasons, because the plaintiff later asserted, in his bill, that he possesse-d the requisite financial ability, and the motion to -dismiss
admitted the allegation.

line, Buck brought this suit against Kuykendall, the
Director of Public Works. The case was first heard,
under § 266 of the Judicial Code, before three judges,
on an application for a preliminary injunction. They
denied the application. 295 Fed. 197. A further application for the injunction made after amending the bill
_was likewise denied. 295 .Fed. 203. Then the case was
heard by the District Judge upon a motion to dismiss the
amended bill. The final decree dismissing the bill was
entered without further opinion. See also Interstate
Motor Transit Co. v. Kuykendall, 284 Fed. 882.
That part of the Pacific Highway which lies within the
State of Washington was built by it with federal aid
pursuant to the Act of July 11, 1916, c. 241, 39 Stat. 355,
as amended February 28; 1919, c. 69, 40 Stat. 1189, 1200,
and the Federal Highway Act, November 9, 1921, c. 119,
42 Stat. 212. Plaintiff claimed that the action taken by
the Washington officials, and threatened, violates rights
conferred by these federal acts and guaranteed both by
;the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause.
In support of the decree dismissing the bill this argument
is made: The right to travel interstate by auto vehicle,
upon the public highways may be a privilege or immunity
of citizens of the United States. Compare Crandall v.
Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. A citizen may have, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the right to travel and transport his
property upon them by auto vehicle. But he has no
right to make the highways his place of business by using
them as a common carrier for hire. Such use is a privilege which may be granted or withheld by the State in its
discretion, without violating either the due process clause
or the equal protection clause. Packard v. Banton, 264
U. S. 140, 144. The highways belong to the State. It
may make provision appropriate for securing the safety
and convenience of the public in the use of them. Kane
v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. 160. It may impose fees with a

view both to raising funds to defray the cost of supervision and maintenance and to obtaining compensation
for the use. of the road facilities provided. Hendrick v.
Maryland, 235 U. S. 610. See also Pierce Oil Corp6ration v. Hopkins, 264 U. S. 137. With the increase in
number and size of the vehicles used upon a highway,
both the danger and the wear and tear grow. To exclude
unnecessary vehicles-particularly the large ones commonly used by carriers for hire-promotes both safety
and economy. State regulation of that character is valid
even as applied to interstate commerce, inthe absence of
legislation by Congress which deals specifically with the
subject. Vandalia R. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 242 U. S.255; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee
Flour Mills Co., 211 U. S. 612. Neither the recent federal
highway acts, nor the earlier post road acts, Rev. Stat.
§ 3964; Act of March 1, 1884, c. 9, 23 Stat. 3, do that.
The state statute is not objectionable because it is designed primarily to promote good service by excluding
unnecessary competing carriers. That purpose also is
within the State's police power.
The argument is not sound. It may be assumed that
§ 4 of the state statute is consistent with the Fourteenth
Amendment; and also, that appropriate state regulations
adopted primarily to promote safety upon the highways
and conservation in their use are not obnoxious to the
Commerce Clause, where the indirect burden imposed
upon interstate commerce is not unreasonable. Compare
Michigan Public-Utilities Commission v. Duke, 266 U. S.
571. The provision here in question is of a different
character. Its primary purpose is not regulation with a
view to safety or to conservation of the highways, but the
prohibition of competition. It determines not the.manner of use, but the persons by whom the highways may
be used. It prohibits such use to some persons while

permitting it to others for the same purpose and in the
same manner. Moreover, it determines whether the prohibition shall be applied by resort, through state officials,
to a test which is peculiarly within the province of federal
action-the existence of adequate facilities for conducting
interstate commerce. The vice of the legislation is dramatically exposed by the fact that the State of Oregon
had issued its certificate which may be deemed equivalent to a legislative declaration that, despite existing
facilities, public convenience and necessity required the
establishment by Buck of the auto stage line between
Seattle and Portland. Thus, the provision of the Washington statute is a regulation, not of the use of its own
highways, but of interstate commerce. Its effect upon
such commerce is not merely to burden but to obstruct it.
Such state action is forbidden by the Commerce Clause.
It also defeats the purpose of Congress expressed in the
legislation giving federal aid for the construction of interstate highways.
- By motion to dismiss filed in this Court, the State
makes the further. contention that Buck is estopped from
seeking relief against the provisions of § 4. The argument is this: Buck's claim is not that the Department's
action is unconstitutional because arbitrary or unreasonable. It is that § 4 is unconstitutional because use of the
highways for interstate commerce is denied unless the prescribed certificate shall have been secured. Buck applied
for a certificate. Thus he invoked the exercise of the
power which he now assails. One who invokes the provisions of a law may not thereafter question its constitutionality. The argument is unsound. It is true that one
cannot in the same proceeding both assail a statute and
rely upon it. Hurley v. Commission of Fisheries, 257 U.
S. 223, 225. Compare Wall v. Parrot Silver & -Copper
Co., 244 U. S. 407,411. Nor-can one wvho avails himself

St. Louis Co. v. PrendergastCa., 260 U. S. 469, 472. But
in the case at bar, Buck does not rely upon any provision
of the statute assailed; and he has received no benefit
under it. He was willing, if permitted to use the highways, to comply with all laws relating to common carriers.
But the permission sought was denied. The case presents no element of estoppel. Compare Arizona v. Copper Queen Mining'Co., 233 U. S. 87, 94 et seq.

COMMISSION OF MARYLAND.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
MARYLAND.

No. 185. Argued January'16, 1925.-Decided March 2, 1925.
1. A statute of Maryland, 1922, c. 401, prohibits common carriers
of merchandise or freight by motor vehicle from using public
highways over specified routes without a permit; requires a commission to investigate the expediency of granting a permit when
applied for, and authorizes it to refuse if it deems the granting
of the permit prejudicial to the welfare and convenience of the
public. Held unconstitutional as applied to one desirous of using
the highways as a common carrier in exclusively interstate commerce. Buck v. Kuykendall, ante, p. 307. P. 323.
2. The facts that the highways here in question were not constructed
or improved with federal aid, and that refusal of the pernift is
not mandatory under the statute but in exercise of a broad discretion vested in the commission, do not affect this conclusion.
