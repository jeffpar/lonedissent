by the law of that State, as to which it would be premature
to express ali olpinion, wa-h~r that the .plaintiffs' argument probably would be regarded as correct. Zinsmeister

Dustan v. McAndrew, 44 N. Y. 72, 78; Van Brocklen v.

KAPLAN v. TOD, COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 241. Argued January 26, 1925.-Decided March 2, 1925.
1. Section 217-2 of the Revised Statutes, by which naturalization of
-parents extends to minor children "if dwelling in the United
States," does not apply where a child was rightly denied entry
as a feeble-minded person and ordered deported but permitted,
under special safeguards, to remain in this country with her father
while the deportation was temporarily suspended because of the
late war. P. 229.
2. Under the above circumstances, the alien, properly speaking, has
not "entered" the United States and is not "found" there but
is in custody at the limit of jurisdiction awaiting the order of the
authorities; consequently the limitation of five years upon liability
to deportation (Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, §19, 39 Stat. 889)
is inapplicable. P. 230.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from an order dismissing a petition
of the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus. The petiti6n alleges that the petitioner is a citizen of the United

States, and that she is unlawfully detained by the respondent under a warrant of deportation issued by the
Assistant Secretary of Labor, without jurisdiction and
without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. An appeal was taken directly to this Court on the alleged infringement of the appellant's constitutional rights. Chin
Yow v. United States, 208 U. S. 8, 13. Ng Fung Ho v.
White, 259 U. S. 276, 284.
The appellant was born in Russia. On July 20, 1914.
being then about thirteen years old, she was brought to
this countryj where her father already was, by her mother.
Upon examination she was certified to be feeble minded,
and was ordered to be excluded, but before the order
could be carried into effect the European war had begun.
Deportation necessarily was suspended, and she was kept
at Ellis Island until June, 1915. In the latter half of
that month she was handed over to the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society upon its undertaking to
accept custody of the child until she could be deported
safely, to return her when required, and meanwhile to
prevent her becoming a public charge: The Society
allowed her to live with her father, which she has done
ever since. On December 14, 19'20, her father was naturalized, she being then about nineteen. The warrant of deportation was issued on January 19i 1923; the writ of
habeas corpus was allowed on April 24, and was dismissed
on the following October 9.
It is not questioned that the appellant rightly was denied admission in July, 1914, or that she is feeble minded..

still. Act of March 26, 1910, c. 128; 36 Stat. 263. But
it is said that she became a citizen by the naturalization
of her father while she was a minor and in this country,
Rev. Stats. § 2172, and that she cannot be deported upon
a warrant issued more than five years after her entry into
the United States. Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, § 19;
39 Stat. 874, 889; Act of February 20, 1907, c' 1134, § 20;
34 Stat. 898, 904. The answers to both arguments are
much the same. Naturalization of parents affects minor
children only "if dwelling in the United States." Rev.
Stats. § 2172. The appellant could not lawfullyhave
landed in the United States in view of the express prohibition of the Act of 1910 just referred to, and until she
legally landed "could not have dwelt within the United
States." Zartarianv. Billings, 204 U. S. 170,175. Moreover while she was at Ellis Island she was to be regarded
as stopped at the boundary line and kept there unless
and until her right to enter should be declared. United
States v. Ju Toy, 198 U. S.-253, 263. When her prison
bounds were enlarged by committing.her to the custody
of the Hebrew Society, the nature of her stay within the
territory was not changed. She was still in theory of law
at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the
United States. Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, 142
U. S. 651, 661. She never has been dwelling in the
United States within the meaning of the Act. Still more
clearly she never has begun to reside permanently in the
United States within the later Act of March 2, 1907, c.
2534, § 5; 34 Stat. 1229. United States ex rel. P.atton v.
Tod, 297 Fed. 385, affirming s. c. 292 Fed. 243. United
States ex rel. De Rienzo v: Rodgers, 185 Fed. 334.
The later of the limitation acts, the Adt of February 5,
1917, c. 20, § 19, 39 Stat. 874, 889, applies to 'any alien
who at the time of entry was a member of one oik more
of the classes excluded by law' and to 'any alien who
shall have entered or-who shall be. found in the United

States in violation of'this Act.' For the reasons already
stated the appellant never has entered the-United States
within the meaning of the law, and is not properly de-scribed in the warrant as' found in the United States in
violation of the immigrant authorities.' Theoretically she
is in custody at the limit of the jurisdiction awaiting the
order of the authorities. It would be manifestly absurd
to hold that the five years run in favor of one held at
Ellis Island for deportation, and as we have said the position of the appellant is the same.

ERROR TO THE SUPREM COURT OF THE STA

.OF ARKANSAS.

No. 266. Submitted January 28, 1925.--Decided March 2,1925.
Where a piivate gas company, empowered to become a public service
corporation, changed its status accordingly aild. exercised the
power of eminent domain soon after it had contracted to furnish
-future supplies of gas to a consumer, and thb face of the contract,

an unconstitutional impairment of the-contract.. P. 232.
