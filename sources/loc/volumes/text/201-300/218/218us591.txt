couldnot revoke it as to any "interest or right founded or
created upon faith thereof" and which "required its
perpetuation and continuance," as the Court of Appeals
has correctly said, and we think with that learned court,
that it would be 6xtremely inequitable to regard it as irrev-

ocable to plaintiff and those in his situation. Indeed, it
is not within the contemplation of the statute that the
authority to the commissioner is to be available to those
in the situation of plaintiff.

ATTORNEY GENERAL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
No. 58.

Argued November 29, 30, 1910.-Decided December 12, 1910.

This court does not inquire into the knowledge, negligence, methods
or motives of the legislation if, as in this qase, the statute is passed
in due form; and where the statute repeals the charter of a corporation under the reserved'power of repeal, the only question here is
whether the statute goes beyond the power expressly reserved.
A corporation contracts subject, and not paramount, to reservations
in its charter and cannot, by making contracts or incurring obligations, remove or affect such reservations.
A franchise given by a city to a public service corpdratisn does not
enlarge the right of the corporation to exist as against an ,expressly
reserved power to repeal the charter, even if the corporation has
mortgaged such franchise.
In this case, held. that the question of paxties is not open in this court.,
153 Michigan, 724, affirmed.

Under the law of Michigan, public service corporations

Franchises of public service corporations are property
and cannot be taken or used by others without compensation. Willcox v. Gas Co., 212 U. S. 22; Wilmington R. R.

A statute separating the tangible property of a corporation from its franchise, and taking the former for public
use while forbidding any compensation for the latter, is
unconstitutional. The legislature may determine what
private property is needed for. public use, but the question of compensation is a judicial one. The legislature
may neither say what compensation shall be made nor
fix the rule of compensation. Monongahela Nay. Co. v.

The dissolution of a corporation cannot impair the obligation of its contracts or the claims of its creditors; they

The so-called repealing acts are unconstitutional because they deprive the Hydraulic Company, its bondholders and other creditors of their property without due

An act repealing or amending the charter or powers of a

to abrogate lawful prior contracts, is unconstitutional,

The cases holding that the property and charter of a
corporation may be taken for public use, upon payment
of "due compensation therefor" axe not in point.
Even if the Hydraulic Company had elected to present a claim against the city under and pursuant to the
repealing acts, by the very terms of those acts such action would have estopped it from setting up that the
prohibition of any compensation for its franchise was

While there is a reasonable presumption of validity of
the repealing acts, the court will not make violent presumptions in favor of such validity. The killing of a
corporation by the legislature is not a trivial action.

Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 718.
While there ig a strong presumption that the journals
of a legislative body are correct, Federal courts, under
proper pleadings, have the power when-contract rights are
involved, to go behind the face of legislative acts and,
also, of the journals, when a State claims it has annulled
a private charter. New Jersey v. Yard, 95 U. S. 104, 113;

Incorrect and defective legislative journals if made conclusive might have the indirect effect of nullifying a
Federal power granted to the Supreme Court of the
United States, and be constitutional inhibitions and restrictions against a State impairing the obligations of contracts or depriving one of property without due process of

Hydraulic Company. It was rendered, upon an information in the nature of quo warranto, by a County Court,
and was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 153
Michigan, 724. The case was heard on demurrer. The
defendants pleaded that in 1849 the legiglature incorporated the Grand Rapids' Hydraulic Company, and that
they were directors of the company; that the company
had constructed and was maintaining an elaborate system
of water supply; that in 1905 the legislature purported
to repeal this charter, but that, owing to the manner in
which the repeal was passed, as well as to the contents
of the act purporting to effect it, the repeal was void under
Article I, § 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States. Seemingly in aid' of
this contention, the defendants alleged the issue of bonds
and a mortgage of the company's plant, including its
franchise to own and operate the same, that still are outstanding. To this plea the-State demurred.
As to the manner in which the repeal was obtained
and passed, the plea alleged that the city of Grand Rapids
was a rival of the company in furnishing water, and that
the mayor and city authorities carried out an unfair
scheme for getting the repeal lhy.ried -through the legislature without notice to the c4 mpany. It set out the
particulars with much detail. The defendants new, on
the ground that there are limits even to the operation
of a reserved power to repeal, argue that we should consider these allegations. But we do not inquire into the
knowledge; negligence; imiethods or motives of the legislature if, as in this case, the repeal was passed in due form.
United S&ates v. Des Moines Navigation & Railway Co.,
142 U. S.510, 544. The only question that we can consider is whether them is anything relevant to the present
case in the terms on effect of the repeal that goes beyond
the power that the charter expressly reserves.
The charter provides that "The legislature may at any

time hereafter amend or repeal this act." Art No. 223,
Laws of 1849, § 11. Now, in the first place, with regard
to the reference in argument to the bondholders, it is
enough to say that they are not before the court. The
defendants do not represent them; the defendants represent the debtors, not the creditors. By making a contract or incurring a debt the defendants, so far as they,
are concerned, could not get rid of an infirmity inherent
in the corporation. They contracted subject not para-'
mount to the proviso for repeal, as is shown by a long
line of cases. Greenwood v. Freight Co., 105 U. S. 13.
Bridge Co. v. United States, 105 U. S. 470. Chicago Life
Insurance Co. v. Needles, 113 U. S. 574. MonongahelaNay,
igation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 313, 338, 340. New
Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, 185 U. S. 336, 353,
354. Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 189 U. S. 434, 437,
438. Manigault v. Springs, 199 U. S. 473, 480. It would
be a waste of words to try to make clearer than it is on its
face the meaning and effect of this reservation of the power
to repeal.
But the legislature did not content itself with a bare
repeal and leave the consequences to the law. Act No. 492
of the Local Acts of 1905, after repealing the charter, provides that the company, at any time before January, 1906,
may present a claim to the city of Grand Rapids for
the value of its real and tangible estate, 'not including franchise,' and transfer the property to the city. If the parties do not agree an action of assumpsit may be brought,
with the usual incidents, and the amount of the final judgment is made a claim against the city, to be paid like other
claims. If the company does not elect this course, it may
remove the property, first giving bond, to be approved
by the common council, to protect the city from any damages caused thereby, and is to leave the streets in as good
condition as before. It is argued that these provisiop
are void, and the argument mqy perhaps be abridged

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

as follows: Corporations with existence limited in time may

take a fee simple or a franchise of longer duration than
themselves. Minneapolis v. Minneapolis Street Ry. Co.,
215 U. S. 417, 430. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street Ry.
Co., 1841U. S. 368, 394, 395. There is a distinction between
the franchise to be a corporation and that to operate its
plant. Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co., 202 U. S.
453, 464. As the corporation had been authorized to lay
its pipes, and lawfully hadfmortgaged not only its pipes
but its franchise to own and operate them, it must be
taken to have given a security not limited or terminable
by anything short of payment. The attempt to extinguish the corporation, if successful, would render the security and continuing franchise unavailable and is void.
It is argued further that the exclusion of 'franchise' (assumed to embrace the supposed franchise to operate the
works) from the valuation is unconstitutional.
We express no opinion as to whether the premises of
the foregoing argument are justified by anything appearing in the present record. In any event the conclusion
cannot be maintained. If the city gave the privilege of
using the streets to the corporation forever it could not
enlarge the right of the corporation to continue in existence 'as against the sovereign power, as sufficiently appears from the cases already cited. See also Arkansas
Southern Ry. Co. v. Louisiana & Arkansas Ry. Co., ante,
p. 431. The only question before us now is the validity
of the judgment ousting the defendants from "assuming
to act as a body corporate, and particularly under the
name and style of the Grand Rapids Hydraulic Company." This really is too plain to require the argument
that we have spent upon it. We may add that it is a
matter upon which the bondholders have nothing to say.
Moreover the question of parties-is not open here. New

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 390.

Argued November 10, 11, 1910.-Decided December 12, 1910.

Under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat.
1246, when the indictment is quashed this court is confined to a
consideration of the grounds of decision mentioned in such statute,
United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370, and there is-a similar limit
when the case comes up from a judgment sustaining a special plea
in bar.
Although mere continuance of result of a crime does not continue the
crime itself, if such continuance of result depends upon continuous
co6peration of the conspirators, the conspiracy continues until the
time of its abandonment or success.
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is more than a contract in restraint
of trade; the latter is instantaneous, but the former is a partnership
in criminal purposes and as such may.have continuance in time; and
so held in regard to a conspiracy made- criminal by the Anti-trust
Act of July 2, 1890.
Whether the indictment in this case charges a continuing conspiracy
with technical sufficiency is not before the court on the appeal taken
under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, from a judgment
sustaining special pleas of limitation in bar.
Allegations in the indictment consistent with other facts alleged that
a conspiracy continued until the date of filing must be denied under
the general issue and cannot be met by special plea in bar..
This couht, having on an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act of
March 2, 1907, held that allegations as to continuance of a conspiracy cannot be met by special plea in bar, all defenses, including
that of limitations by the ending of the conspiracy more thari three
