RICHARDSON v. AINSA, ADMINISTRATOR OF
ELY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
ARIZONA.
No. 28. Argued.November 2, 1910.-Decided November 14, 1910.
Notwithstanding the contention of appellant in this case, the decision
of this court in Ainsa v. New Mexico & Arizona R. R. Co., No. 2,
175 U. S. 91, that the District Court of Arizona had jurisdiction of
an action to quiet title brought by a grantee of the Mexican Government of land in the territory included in the Gadsden Purchase, did
not proceed upon a mistake in fact and is not inconsistent with the
reasoning of the decision of Ainsa v.New Mexico & Arizona R. R.
Co., No. 1, 175 U. S. 76.Under the Gadsden Purchase Treaty with Mexico of December 30,
1853, 10 Stat. 1031, the good faith of the United States was pledged
to respect Mexican titles, and one whose title was absolutely perfected prior to the treaty was not bound to present his title .or confirmation to the Court of Private Land Claims under the act of
March 3, 1891; nor did the fact that he prayed for confirmation, in
a suit brought by the United States against him in that court to
declare the patent void or to determine boundaries if valid, limit
his claim to the recovery of the price specified in the act for land
included within the grant but patented to others by the United
States.
While under § 14 of the act of March 3, 1891, where the claimant of a
Mexican land grant himself presented his claim to a Mexican grant
in the Gadsden Purchase to the Court of Private Land Claims he
might be limited to recovery in the casu of lands within his grant
sold by the United States to the price specified in the act, where he
is brought into the court by the United States in a suit attempting
to set aside a grant, title to which was perfected before the treaty,
he is not so limited and patents issued by the 'United States to lands
within the boundaries of his grant are mere usurpations and void.

in the territory known as the Gadsden Purchase, are
stated in the opinion.
Mr. S. L. Kingan for appellant, submitted:
Although this court had already once decided in this
case (Ainsa v. New Mexico Ry., 175 U. S. 91) that the
District Court of Arizona did have jurisdiction, yet,
from the- face of the decision it is apparent that the
grounds supporting the decision are diametrically opposed to the conclusion arrived at, so that it is patent
from the decision itself that it should have been to the
contrary.
The acts of July 22, 1854, 10 Stat. 308, and July 15,
1870, 16 Stat. 304, remained in active force and effect
until the act of March 3, 1891, creating the Court of Private Land Claims.
Between July 22, 1854, and March 3, 1891, during
which time this suit was instituted, the only tribunals,
therefore, that had jurisdiction to try title to land grants
was the surveyor general of New Mexico and Arizona
and the Congress of the United States. Ainsa v. United
States, 175 U. S.91, and see Astiazaran v. Santa Rita Co.,
148 U. S.80.
It is immaterial how this court came to make its said
error, whether through stipulations of the parties or
otherwise, as jurisdiction cannot be stipulated, and it is
always subject to be questioned by a litigant.
The previous decision as to jurisdiction should be
changed to the conclusion derived from the grounds cited
in support of the correct decision.
The lands in suit were public lands of the United States.
While the United States was bound to respect the titles
of Mexican grantees, all, the land ceded belonged to the
United States except the interests of Mexican grant
claimants, and a statute was passed giving these grant
claimants a right and an opportunity to establish their

RICHARDSON v. AINSA.

Argument for Appellant.

claims of record. Until this was availed of by the grantee
the land was at least prima facie public land. No notice
having been given for twenty-five years, the United
States was fully able to give such title and patent to the
land as would bar the Mexican grant claimants from
denying that the lands were public lands.
Under the Gadsden Purchase Treaty grantees from
Mexico, of land embraced in the ceded district, are entitled to be protected in their property rights, the same
as natural-born Americans. This would probably be so
even if nothing were provided in the treaty. But that
matter is definitely settled in the context. There is
nothing in the statute requiring grantees to prove claims
that violate the obligations of the United States under the
treaty.
. There is no confiscation nor deprivation without due
process of law. The statute says that under certain circumstances, when land is patented to others, the grantee
from Mexico shall take money in lieu of such land. The
Congress of the United States decided that money would
be a just compensation, and we have no higher authority.
Therefore the grant claimant must have delayed so long
as to give one a prima facie right to a patent. Even
though the statute be in violation of treaty rights, there is
no other recourse for the judiciary department than upholding the law. The violation of a treaty is not grounds
for the court to act upon. The judiciary department
must follow the law promulgated by the legislative department. If the legislators choose to violate a treaty,
the affair is of a political aspect, and not a matter for the
court's jurisdiction. Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U. S. 238;
Edye v. Robertson, 112 U. S. 580; In re Ah Lung, 18 Fed.
Rep. 28; Horner v. United States, 143 U. S. 570.
The statute, however, does not violate, but is in furtherance of, the treaty. United States v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 441.
Even if the Mexican grantee is brought before the

.court against his wishes, he is bound by the statute requiring him to accept money in lieu of patented lands
within the boundaries of his grant. The United States
has power to bring a party into court and have him bound
by the decision. The Arizona decision, following the
decision of the case in 34 L. D. 612, erred in saying that

untarily submitted to the
All the principles of equity-laches, unjust enrichment,
estoppel, fraud, etc.-unite in overthrowing any claim to
this Mexican grant. Besides these equitable principles
there are both the spirit and express wording of the
statute directly in point, the interpretation of .which
cannot possibly be distorted to cover imaginary exceptions. See United States v. Conway, 175 U. S. 60; Real de
Dolores v. United States, 175 U. S. 75; Ainsa, Admr., v.
Magee, 34 L. D. 506; Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U. S.
238; United States v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 441; United States
v. Baca, 184 U. S. 653.
The Court of Private Land Claims had no right to determine that the grant was a perfect one -at the time of the
treaty, but-its only authority was to pass upon its jurisdiction, and to find that it had no jurisdiction.
The statute provides a means whereby the claimants'
rights could have been established and recogniz d and
proved for the benefit of all concerned. The statute provides for an adequate means of protecting one's rights in
land and for preventing anyone being injured by unknown claims. Doolan v. Carr, 125 U. S. 618; Newhall v.
Sanger, 92 U. S. 761, cited by appellee, do not sustain his
position, nor do Cameron v. United States, 148 U. S. 301;
Reynegan v. Bolton, 95 U.'S. 33.

This court having heretofore decided on appeal in this

that question is settled and cannot be raised again.

The grant, being a complete and perfect grant prior to
the treaty of cession, the grantee thereof, his heirs and
assigns, had title in fee, which was not in any way affected
by the change of sovereignty. United States v. Percheman,

treaty, so provides. Ely v. United States, 171 U. S. 220,

The lands embraced within the grant being private
property the patents issued to parts thereof under the
United States public land laws were utterly void. Knight

While so reserved the homestead patents under which
Richardson claims title were issued. Patents for lands
reserved from sale are void. Burfenning v. Chicago R. R.

618, 642; Noble v. Union River R. R. Co., 147 U. S. 165,
176.
Lands within the limits of a claimed Mexican grant in
Arizona, being reserved from sale or, disposal by the acts
of Congress aforesaid, are not "public lands" of the
United States, and are not subject to sale under the public
land acts. Cameron v. United States, 148 U. S. 301, 311;
Reynegan v. Bolton, 95 U. S. 33, 37; Newell v. Sanger, 92
U. S. 761, 766.
Under the cited acts of Congress the reservation became immediately operative upon all lands within the
ceded territory covered at the time by any Spanish or
Mexican claim which originated prior to the treaty of
cession. Op. Sec. of Int., 30 L. D. 97, 105.
The act of Congress creating the Court of Private Land
Claims does not deprive the owner of a perfect grant, if he
is brought into that court as a party defendant at the suit
of the Government, of lands which previously had been
unlawfully and without right patented to others, under
the public land laws, and such lands are not excluded by
the terms of that act from the grant as confirmed by that
court. Ely's Admr. v. Magee, 34 L. D. 506, 517; Richardson v. Ainsa, 95 Pac. Rep. (Ariz.) 103, 105.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit to quiet title brought in 1887 by the appellee's intestate in the District Court of Arizoia. The
decision was in favor of the appellee, and this decision
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory,

RICHARDSON v. AINSA.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

whereupon the defendant Richardson appealed to this
.court.
The appellee represents a title derived from a grant by
the Mexican Government of land in the portion of Arizona
afterwards acquired by the Gadsden Purchase, December 30, 1853. 10 Stat. 1031. At the time of the Gadsden
Purchase this title was complete. The appellant claims
through mesne conveyances from holders of patents issued
by the United States in 1879 and 1880 under the homestead laws.
The first error assigned is that the District Court was
without jurisdiction. That point already has been decided against the appellant in this very case under the
name of Ainsa v. New Mexico & Arizona R. R. Co., No. 2,
175 U. S. 91, so that it is not open to him to urge it.
United States v. Camou, 184 U. S. 572, 574. But it is
proper to. say that in our opinion the decision did not
proceed upon a mistake of fact and is not inconsistent
with the reasoning of the immediately preceding decision
between the same parties, 175 U. S. 76, 86, although
No. 2 was begun before and No. 1 after the passage of
the act of March 3, 1891, c. 539, 26 Stat. 854, establishing
a Court of Private Land Claims.
In 1892 the United States brought a suit against the
present appellee in the ,Court of Private Land Claims,
alleging that his claim was void, and that the United
States had granted patents for portions of the land, praying that the title might be-adjudicated, and, if valid, the
boundaries established, excepting such parts as might
have been disposed of by the United States. The appellee answered setting up title, and praying confirmation.
Ultimately in pursuance of the decision of this court, Ely's
Administratorv. United States, 171 U. S. 220, a decree was
entered in his favor and a patent issued to him on
October 29, 1906, specifying no exceptions other than one of
"gold, silver, or quicksilver mines or minerals of the same."

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

218 U.S.

The appellant however contends that by virtue of the
above-mentioned statute of March 3, 1891, the effect of
the appellee's appearance in the Court of Private Land
Claims was to forfeit all portions of the land in controversy that had been patented by the United States, and
to give the appellee in place of it a claim for not exceeding
$1.25 per acre so patented against the United States. The
contrary decision is the other error assigned.
Of course, the patents for homesteads issued in the
name of the- United States, on the facts that we have
stated, were a mere usurpation and were void. The lands
covered by them, whether reserved or not by the acts of
July 22, 1854, c' 103, § 8, 10 Stat. 308; July 15, 1870,
c. 292, 16 Stat. 304, were not public lands, but private
property, which the Government was bound by the express terms of the Gadsden Treaty of December 30, 1853,
to respect. The appellant's claim rests solely on an interpretation of §§ 8 and 14 of the above-mentioned act
of 1891, that would cut down the performance of the
treaty promise by the United States to at least to the
narrowest limits consistent with good faith. We are of
opinion that the different construction adopted by the
court below, and also by the Acting Secretary of the
Interior in Ely v. Magee, 34 L. D. 506, 512, is correct.
After providing in § 6 for incomplete titles the act goes
on in §8 to deal with complete ones. Holders of claims
under such titles, it says, "shall have the right (but shall
hot be bound) to apply to said court" for a confirmation
of their title. Of course, this means that the title is.
recognized as good without the proceeding in court.
Ainsa v. New Mexico & Arizona R. R. Co.' 175 U. S.
76, 90.
The confirmation is granted, "excepting any part ot
such land that"shall have been disposed of by the United
States," and without prejudice to conflicting private interests. Then, in § 14 it is enacted that "if in any case it

218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

shall appear that the lands or any part thereof decreed to
any claimant under the provisions of this act shall have
been sold or granted by the United States to any 9ther
person, such title from the United States to such otber
person shall remain valid, notwithstanding such decree,"
with a provision for a judgment in favor of the claimant
against the United States for the proved value of such
granted lands, not exceeding $1.25 per acre. If this were
all there could be no question that the exception of lands
granted by the United States was merely a condition
attached to the decree of confirmation, and did not purport to affirm such grants if the claimant did not see fit to
go into the Court of Private Land Claims.
But in § 8 there is a. further provision by which the
United States may proeed against the claimant, as it did.
against the appellee, on the ground that the title or
boundaries are open to question, and therefore the court
is to determine the matter, "but subject to all lawful
rights adverse to such claimant or possessor, as between
such claimant and possessor and any other claimant or
possessor, and subject in this respect to all the provisions
of this section applicable thereto." The appellant argues
.that this provision gives a wider meaning to § 14. He
says that the words "if in any case" it shall appear that
lands have been sold by the United States apply as well
to a proceeding by the United States as to one where the
claimant goes forward. He argues that so to apply them
is just, in view of the supposedly unknown boundaries of
the old Mexican grants and the policy of the United States
in offeringits public J4nds.to se'tlers-that otherwise there
is a suspended threat and possibility of a claimant trning
up after many years and dispossessing those who had been
encouraged by the United States to go upon the land.
Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U. S. 238. But the considerations mentioned in the case cited did not prevent the
United States in the act of March 3, 1891, from leaving

the holders of perfected titles free not to present them to
the court as they were required to do in earlier statutes.
The good faith of the United States was pledged to respect
the Mexican titles. It recognized in the act of 1891 that
holders of such titles need not go into the Land Claims
Court to get them confirmed, and we should be slow to
suppose that it meant to make a doubt in the Department
of Justice as to the validity of a perfect title a ground for
cutting down what otherwise it was bound to protect and
did by the statute leave intact. But for that unfounded
doubt the appellee would have been secure in his rights,
and could have turned the holders of the homestead
patents off his land. ' United States v. Martinez, 184 U. S.
441, 445. The proceeding by the Government was a
matter over which he had no control, and ought not to
affect his' rights. Looking at the words of § 14 more
exactly they do not require the appellant's construction.
"If in any case" means in any'case before the court that
the act established. And when the section goes on, "it
shall appear that the lands or any part thereof decreed
to any claimant under the provisions of this act shall have
been sold," it is reasonable to suppose that it has reference
to those cases in which a claimant is seeking a decree, that
is to say, where the claimant is the plaintiff in the case.
It is true that a petition by the United States may end in
the same result, but the terms of the sentence and the
duty of the Government concur in leading us to limit the
words as we do. On the other hand, the consideration
mentioned sufficiently shows that the claimant did not
impair his position by praying for confirmation in his
answer. The prayer merely expressed what would have
happened without it by the force of law.
Judgment affirmed.
