OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Statement of the Case.

218 U. S..

IN RE AMETROPOLITAN TRUST COMPANY OF
THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF PROHIBITION OR MANDAMUS.

No. 12. Original.-Submitted May 16, 1910.-Restored to the docket
for oral argument May 31, 1910.-Argued October 11, 1910.-Decided
November 14, 1910.
All parties to the record who appear to have any interest in the challenged ruling must be given an opportunity to be heard on an appeal,
and the decision of the Circuit Court of -Appeals reversing a decree
of the Circuit Court applies only to the parties brought before that
court.
After the Circuit Court has refused to remand, has tried the issues and
entered judgment dismissing the complaint as to certain defendants,
it cannot, after the Circuit Court of Appeals has, on an appeal to
which such defendants were not made parties, reversed the order
refusing to remand, vacate the 'judgment dismissing the complaint
as to the defendants not parties after the expiration of the term at.
which such judgment was entered.
A decree of the Circuit Court refusing to remand a cause cannot, even
if error and subsequently reversed on appeal by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, be treated as a nullity; and proceedings of the Circuit
Court while it retained jurisdiction as to defendants not parties to
such appeal remain in full force.
A court cannot deal with a decree other than for correction of clerical
error or inadvertance after the termination of the term at which it
was entered.
Where the Circuit Court vacates a decree without jurisdiction and
refuses to reinstate it, mandamus is the proper remedy to compel it
to do so.

THIS is an application by the Metropolitan Trust
Company of the city of New York, which had been impleaded as a defendant in the suit of James Pollitz v. The
Wabash Railroad Company, for a writ of prohibition or
mandamus directed to the Circuit Court of the United

IN RE METROPOLITAN TRUST CO.

Statement of the Case.

States for the Southern District of New York, to forbid
the exercise of jurisdiction over the petitioner and over a
decree dated January 10, 1908, in its favor in said suit,
and in the alternative to provide that any order for the
vacating of said decree should be set aside.. A rule to
show cause was issued, to which return has been .made,and from the petition and return the following facts
appear:
On or about January 15, 1907, James Pollitz brought
suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York
against the Wabash Railroad Company and others to
declare illegal and void certain securities of the Railroad
Company issued in exchange for debenture bonds pursuant
to a plan complained of as injurious to the stockholders,
and for a refxchange, and in default thereof for an accounting by the defendants with respect to the new securities which had been issued.
On January 25, 1907, the Railroad Company caused
the case to be removed to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York on the
ground that there was a separable controversy between
it as a citizen of the State of Ohio and the complainant,
a citizen of the State' of New york.
The complainant moved:to remand the cause, and on
February 21; 1907, the motion was denied. Thereupon
application was made to this court for a writ of mandamus
to compel the remand and the petition was denied. In re
james Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323.
After the removal of the cause the defendants demurred
to the bill of complaint, the Trust Company demurring
separately, and all the demurrers were overruled, save
that of the Trust Company which was sustained. A
decree was entered on January 10, 1908, which, after overruling the other demurrers, provided as follows:
"Ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the demurrer of
the defendant the Metropolitan Trust Company of the

OCTOtER TERM, 1910.

218 U. S.

City of New York, be, and the same hereby is, sustained,
and that the bill of complaint be, and the same hereby is
dismissed as to the defendant the Metropolitan Trust
Company of the City of New York, with costs."
The defendants other than the Trust Company then
answered. An earlier suit, to which the Trust Company
was not a party, was pending in the same court, with
regard to the same transaction, and the court denying the
motion of the complainant for leave to discontinue the
first suit ordered the suits to be consolidated. After
hearing a final decree was entered on February 23, 1909,
dismissing the bill in each suit upon the merits.
The complainant then appealed to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, but no review was sought of the decree of
January
10, 1908, dismissing the bill in the second suit as
against the
Trust Company; and the Trust Company was
not cited and did not in any way become a party to the
appeal.
On February 18, 1910, the Circuit Court of Appeals
decided that there was not a separable controversy between the complainant and the Railroad Company, and
that the motion to remand should have been granted.
The court accordingly reversed the final decree with direction to the Circuit Court to permit the complainant
to discontinue the first cause and to remand the second
cause to the Supreme Court of the State of New York.
Thereupon, on February 28, 1910, an order for remand
was entered in the Circuit Court, which contained the
following provision as to the Trust Company:
"And it appearing that the defendant Metropolitan
Trust Company duly demurred to the complaint and that
such demurrer was sustained and judgment entered January 10, 1908, dismissing the complaint as to said defendant which has not been appealed from or reversed,
"Ordered, adjudged and decreed that this judgment
remanding said cause to the Supreme Court of the State

of New York shall not apply to said defendant Metropolitan Trust Company."
On March 21, 1910, the complainant moved in the
Circuit Court to Vacate the decree entered January 10,
1908, and to remand the cause as to the Trust Company.
The latter appeared specially and objected to the jurisdiction of the court. The court granted the motion to"
vacate the decree and denied the motion to remand the
cause as to the Trust Company, without prejudice, upon
the ground that the application for such relief should be
made to the judge who entered the order to remand as to
the other defendants.
The Trust Company then applied to this court for a
writ of prohibition or mandamus, as stated.
Mr. Tompkins McIlvaine, with whom Mr. Henry B.
Closson was on the brief, for petitioner:
On the face of the record the Circuit Court was with-,
out power or jurisdiction to enter any order affecting
the rights of petitioner under the final judgment after
the term at which said judgment was rendered had
expired. Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410; Rolle's
Abridgment, p. 749. See also Cameron v. McRpberts, 3
Wheat. 590; Phillips v. Negley, 117 U. S. 665; Weknore v.
Karrick, 205 U. S. 141.
Whether the Circuit Court has any inherent po'*er to
at any time vacate a judgment for want of jurisdiction
to enter it is immaterial in this case, since it appears on
the face of the record that diversity of citizenship existed
between the plaintiff and the removing defendant, who
asserted that a separable, removable controversy existed. between them. The determination, of whether
such controversy existed was a justiciable question to be
decided by the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court, in
the exercise of its proper jurisdiction, did determine that
such a controversy existed, which determination, being

unmodified and unreversed, as against the petitioner,
is binding and conclusive as to it and cannot be treated
as a nullity. In re Winn, 213 U. S. 458, distinguishing

U. S. 327; Re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323.
Where plainly and on the face of the record the Circuit Court is assuming to act beyond its power and
jurisdiction, prohibition or mandamus is an appropriate
remedy for one who has objected to the jurisdiction
improperly assumed to be exercised. As to prohibition
see In re Huguley Mfg. Co., 184 U. S. 297, 301;.Smith v.

Mr. J. Aspinwall Hodge, appearing by appointment of
Judge Ward, United States Circuit Judge, in opposition
to the applications:
This court has no power to issue a writ of prohibition,
in any case, except where the court below is proceeding
as a Court of Admiralty.
The writ never includes the prohibition of an act
already completed. Ex parte Christy, 3 How. 292; Ex
parte Easton, 95 U. S. 68, 72.
The writ of mandamus cannot be used to compel the
Circuit Court to take jurisdiction of a cause which it
has decided, through its Court of Appeals, it has no

IN RE METROPOLITAN TRUST CO.
218 U. S.

Argument for Respondent.

jurisdiction to consider, owing to a failure to show diverse
citizenship between the necessary parties.
The Jonclusion of the Circuit Court that the cause
should be remanded is not reviewable here by appeal or
writ of error or by mandamus. In re Pennsylvania Co.,
137 U. S. 451, 454; Missouri Pac. R. R. v. Fitzgerald,
160 U. S. 556, 581.
A motion in the nature of a writ of error coram vobi8 "is
the exercise of jurisdiction in the court below which
does not admit of revision in this tribunal.". Legerwood
v. Picket, 15 Fed. Cas. 132; S. C., 1 McLean, 143; S. C.,
7 Pet. 144, 148.
The writ of mandamus cannot perform the office of a
writ of error. In re Rice, 155 U. S. 396, 403, citing
American ConstructionCo. v. Jacksonville Ry. Co., 148 U. S.
372, 379; Ex parte Loring, 94 U. S. 418; and see Ex parte
Newman, 14 Wall. 152.
An order or decree sustaining the demurrer of one of
several defendants, is not such a final decision as gives
the right of appeal to the complainant. In re Hohorst,
148 U. S. 262; In re Atlantic City R. R., 164 U. S. 633;
In re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323, 332; Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, 106 U. S. 3.
The Metropolitan Trust Company was not a necessary
party to the cause, although a proper party.
The court may vacate a judgment, after the term has
expired during which it was entered, and its power so
to do is not dependent upon the issue of a formal writ,
or the institution of an action in equity; but in a proper
case relief can be obtained by service of a notice of motion.

147; Ferris v. Douglass, 20 Wend. 626; cited with approval
in Wetmore v. Karrick, 205 U. S. 141, 151.
Whether the order of January 10, 1908, was final or
interlocutory, and whether the Trust Company was a necessary, or only a proper, party, no error was committed,

by the Judge of the Circuit Court, in granting complain-

ant's motion to vacate that order, or decree, on the suggestion or motion of complainant, in view of the mandate
of the Circuit Court of Appeals establishing the fact
that the diverse citizenship did not exist, which was necessary to give jurisdiction to the court to enter the
decree.
The entry of a void judgment does not dismiss the defendant from the court; only a valid final judgment can
do that. City of Olney v. Harvey, 50 Illinois, 453. Much
less does the entry of a void interlocutory decree dismiss a
defendant. United States v. Wallace, 46 Fed. Rep. 569;

MR.JUSTICE HUGHES,

after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
When the complainant moved to remand the cause the
Circuit Couirt had jurisdiction to determine whether or

not a separable controversy existed which justified the
removal from the state court. Its decision was an act
within its jhdicial authority, subject to review upon
appeal after final decree. On the application made to

IN RE METROPOLITAN TRUST CO.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

this court in In re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323, for a writ of
mandamus to compel the remand, the court said (pages
2.31, 333):
"The issue on the motion to remand was whether such
determination could be had without the presence of defendants other than the Wabash Railroad Company, and
this was judicially determined by the Circuit Court, to
which the decision was by law committed.
"The application to this court is for the issue of
the writ of mandamus directing the Circuit Court to
reverse its decision, although in its nature a judicial
act, and within the scope of its jurisdiction and discretion.
"But mandamus cannot be issued to compel the court
below to decide a matter before it in a particular way or
to review its judicial action had in the exercise of legitimate
jurisdiction, nor can the writ be used to perform the office
of an appeal or writ of error.
"If the ruling of the Circuit Court was erroneous, as
is contended, but which we do not intimate, it may be
reviewed after final decree on appeal or error. Missouri
Pacific Railway Company v. Fitzgerald, 160 U. S. 556,
582." See, also, Ex pare Nebraska, 209 U. S. 436; In re
Winn, 213 U. S. 458, 468; Chesapeake & Ohio Railway
Co.. v. McCabe, Admx., 213 U. S. 207.
Having decided to retain the cause, the Circuit Court
proceeded, as it was entitled to proceed, to try the issues.
It heard the demurrers to the bill and overruling the
others it sustained that of the Metropolitan Trust Company. No leave was granted to amend the bill and a decree was entered dismissing it as against the Trust Company. When, after final decree dismissing the bill as
against the other defendants, the complainant appealed
to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the decree in favor of the
Trust Company was not brought before the appellate

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

218 U. S.

court for review and the Trust Company was not a party
to the appeal.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing the final decree and in directing the remand to the
state court, was of course subject to the necessary limitation that it could apply only to the parties who had been
brought before that court. It had no other purport. It
is one of "the ordinary rules respecting ap'eals" that
"all the parties to the record, who appear to have any
interest in the order or ruling challenged, must be given
an opportunity to be heard on such appeal." Davis v.
Mercantile Trust Co., 152 U. S. 590, 593. See also Terry
v. Abraham, 93 U. S. 38; Wilson v. Kiesel, 164 U. S. 248,
251. If a party has not had this opportunity he is not
bound; as to him an essential element of appellate jurisdiction is lacking. Accordingly, when the decree was entered in the court below upon the mandate of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, the Trust Company was expressly excepted from its operation.
It is in this light that the subsequent proceeding in the
Circuit Court must be examined. If that court had jurisdictiofi to vacate the decree of January 10, 1908, in favor
of the Trust Company, it was by viitue of its own control
-over the decree and not by force of the mandate of the
appellate court. Nor could the court exercise the general
power which it possesses to modify or set aside its orders
or decrees prior to the expiration of the term at which the
final decree is entered; for in this case that term had ended
before the motion was made. Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3
Wheat. 591; Ex parte Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488;
Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415; Ayres v. Wiswall,
112 U. S. 187, 190; Phillips v. Negley, 117 U. S. 665, 674.
The motion was not made for the purpose of correcting a
clerical error or an inadvertence. After the term had
expired, and after the complainant had exercised his right
of appeal to procure a review of the errors of which he

IN RE METROPOLITAN TRUST CO.
218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

desired to complain, it was sought to set aside a. decree
which stood unreversed and by which the Trust Company had been dismissed from the cause.
To reach this result the Circuit Court asserted the power
to vacate the decree upon the ground that it had been
rendered without jurisdiction; and the court held that it
must be treated as a nullity. But the decree cannot be so
regarded unless the court, upon the motion to remand,
was without jurisdiction to determine whether a separable
controversy existed, and hence not merely committed
error but exceeded its authority. The decree was not a
nullity unless the order refusing to remand was a nullity;
and the latter contention was negatived by the decision
of this court upon the application for a writ of mandamus
in In re Pollitz, supra. The reversal by the Circuit Court
of Appeals of the final decree as to the other defendants,
and its direction to remand, did not make the decision of
the court of first instance any the less "a judicial act, and
within the scope of its jurisdiction and discretion;" and
as that reversal and direction did not affect the Trust
Company the decree in its favor remained in full force.
The question is not with respect to the mere form of the
application which was made to the Circuit Court for the
purpose of setting the decree aside. When the motion
was made the court was without jurisdiction to vacate the
decree. As the court, in granting the motion, exceeded its
power, mandamus is the appropriate remedy. Ex parte
Bradley, 7 Wall. 364; In re Winn, 213 U. S. 458.
The rule is made absolute and the writ of mandamus
awarded.
