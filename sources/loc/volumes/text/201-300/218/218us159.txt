ROACH v.. ATCHISON, T. & SANTA FE RY. CO.
218 U. S.

159

Counsel for Parties.

while the right to do local business within the State may
not have been derived from the Federal Constitution, the
right to resort to the Federal courts is a creation of the
Constitution of the United States and the statutes passed
in pursuance thereof.
It is enough now to say that within the principles decided at this term, in the cases cited above, the act of
March 13, 1907, as applied to the complainant railroad
company, in view of the admitted facts set out in the bill
in this case, is unconstitutional and void. We find no
error in the decree granted in the Circuit Court, and the
same is affirmed.

Apirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE

concurs in the result.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case was argued at the same time with No. 150,
and involves the validity of the statute of March 13, 1907.
The case was also decided upon demurrer to the bill. The
allegations of the bill and supplemental bill showed that
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company
was within the State of Missouri in compliance with its
laws; that it had acquired a large amount of property
therein; that, being a foreign corporation, it had removed
suits from a State to the Federar court, and the company
averred that for that reason its right to do business in the
State of Missouri was about to. be revoked by the action
of the secretary of state. This case comes within the
principles just laid down in No. 150, and the decree of the
Circuit Court is affirmed.
Affirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in

the result.

argued simultaneously.
