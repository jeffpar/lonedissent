The damage that will be done by removal in this case is
trifling and the petitioner offers to make it good.
The West Virginia decisions that had been rendered
before the petitioner's contract was made, like thQse of
Virginia, favored the petitioner's right. Hurxthal v. Hurxthal, 45 W. Va. 584. We do not understand Lazear v.
Ohio Valley Steel Foundry Co., 65 W. Va. 105, to lay down
a different doctrine. We take it rather as turning on the
special effect of a sale to receivers whose certificates it was
thought were backed by a promise of the court that they
should constitute a first lien. Therefore, we find it unnecessary to consider whether otherwise the doctrine of Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S. 20, coupled with our own opinion that the rule applied in the earlier decision is correct,
would require us to follow that rather than the later case.

OCEANIC STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY, LIMITED, AS OWNER OF THE STEAMSHIP TITANIC, v. MELLOR.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 798.

Argued January 13, 14, 1914.-Decided May 25, 1914.

This case falls within the general proposition that a foreign ship may
resort to the courts of the United States for a limitation of liability
under § 4283, Rev. Stat. The Scotland, 105 U. S. 24.
It is competent for Congress to enact that in certain matters belonging

to admiralty jurisdiction parties resorting to our courts shall recover
only to such extent or in such way as it marks out. Butler v. Boston
S. S. Co., 130 U. S. 527.
In the case of a disaster upon the high seas, where only a single vessel of
British nationality is concerned and there are claimants of many
different nationalities, and where there is nothing before the court
to show what, if any, is the law of the foreign country to which the
vessel belongs, touching the owner's liability for such disaster, such
owner can maintain a proceeding under §§ 4283, 4284 and 4285,
Rev. Stat., and Rules 54 and 56 in Admiralty.
If it appears in such a case that the law of the foreign country to which
the vessel belongs makes provision for the limitation of the vessel
owner's liability, upon terms and conditions different from those
prescribed in the statutes of this country, the owner can, nevertheless, maintain a proceeding int the courts of the United States under
§§ 4283, 4284 and 4285, Rev. Stat., and Rules 54 and 56 in Admiralty.
In such a proceeding the court3 of the United States will enforce the
law of the United States in respect of the amount of such owner's
liability, and not that of the country to which the vessel belongs.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the Limited Liability Act and the right of the petitioner in this
case to the benefit thereof, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles C. Burlingham, Mr. Norman B.

Beecher,

and Mr. J. Parker Kirlin, for Oceanic Steam Navigation
Co., Ltd.:
The Limited Liability Act applies equally to American
and foreign shipowners; it establishes maritime law of the
United States to be universally applied in our courts as
an expression of our conception of justice.
Under The Scotland, 105 U. S. 24, foreign shipowners are
entitled to benefit of our Limited Liability Act.
The English cases giving narrow construction of early
British statute were disapproved by this court in The
Scotland.
The law of limited liability is a part of our maritime
code, and is to be applied whether favorable or adverse to
foreign ships.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Argument for Owners of the Titanic.

233 U. S.

The Harter Act decisions of this court are controlling
authorities in the interpretation of the Limited Liability

Act.
The application of the Harter Act to foreign ships, irrespective of nationality, is based on the broad interpretation previously given the Limited Liability Act.
The rule of limited responsibility has been uniformly
applied in our courts, as shown by a history of the cases.
The application of the Limited Liability Act is not affected by the immaterial circumstance that but a single
vessel is involved; and this notwithstanding the dictum of
Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland.
Under the La Bourgogne Case the doctrine of the law of
the flag applies only to very limited extent.
The claimants' authorities can be distinguished.
The purpose of the Limited- Liability Act is not only
to provide limitation, but also to enable all parties to be
brought into concourse for the determination of whatever
liability exists.
There is no question of limitation presented until the
liability has been determined and until then the consideration of the law to be applied is premature.
In this case no other law than our own has been thus
shown.
Question A should be answered in. the affirmativo; Question B, if answered, in the affirmative; Question C, if answered, The Law of the United States.

or where they belong to different nations whose laws,

force of the general maritime law since the act of 1851
was adopted. The Scotland; La Bourgogne, supra.
The American view in such cases, see The Scotland,
supra, applying the lex fori to cases of collision between
vessels of different nations, has many adherents in continental Europe; although, as already seen, it has not
found acceptance in the highest courts of France, whereas
in Germany the Imperial Court has adopted it only in a
modified form. See Valroger Droit Maritime, § 2124.
Diversity of citizenship of parties litigant is not a factor
of legal significance. If the controversy were one of which
the court might assume or decline jurisdiction in its discretion, the nationality of the parties litigant might be a
material factor. Neptune Nay. Co. v. Timber Co., 37 Fed.

When once the court has assumed jurisdiction it should

happened beyond our territorial jurisdiction, the court

The British courts invariably held American and other
foreign vessels liable without limit for negligent disasters
at sea, while the former British Limitation Act was in
force; although it does not appear that the British courts
were ever asked to apply the American Act as the lex loci
delicti, after that act had been duly pleaded and proved.

There is no analogy between the Limited Liability Act
and the Harter Act. The national policies, of which the
two acts are expressions, are wholly different. The one
act was designed to increase the liability of foreign ships,
the other to diminish the liability of domestic ships.
The purpose of the Limited Liability Act was to change
the position of, and. to confer a. benefit upon American
ships and shipowners only. La Bourgogne, 210 U. S.

The debates accompanying the passage of the liability
acts of 1851 and 1884, and of 1886, extending them to lake
vessels, barges, etc., show that Congress intended them
to apply only to American vessels.
The law of Great Britain must be taken, presumptively,
as a law holding shipowners to unlimited liability.
The petition cannot be aided by any legal rule that the
British law of limited liability is presumed to be similar
to the American law, until shown by proper pleading and
proof not to be similar. No such rule exists. Crosby v.

465, 468; Carpenterv. Grand Trunk R. R., 72 Maine, 388.
The presumption of identity of the foreign law with the
common law of the forum is indulged as a practical rule
of convenience only where the situation is such as to
create a strong probability that the two laws are in truth
and fact identical or substantially so. Dainese v. Hale,
91 U. S. 13, 20, 21; Langdon v. Young, 33 Vermont, 136;

2 Baxter (Tenn.), 25; Leonard v. Columbia Nay. Co., 84
N. Y. 48; Minor, Confl. of Laws, § 214.
The presumption is that the British law on the subject of
limitation of liability is that which is represented by the
common law, judicially known to our courts. Commonwealth v. Chapman, 13 Metc. 68; United States v. Reid,
12 How. 361, 363; Murray v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co.,

Therefore it must be presumed that in Great Britain,
shipowners are liable without limit for disasters governed
by British law, if the shipowner before the court, challenged by his adversary to establish his legal right to enjoy
the benefit of any statute or law of limitation of liability,
fail to plead and prove the British law.
Under the legal principle actually applicable here, the
American courts must be taken as having judicial knowledge of the fact that in 1776 when this country became independent of Great Britain, the laws of the latter (statutory and non-statutory) held shipowners to unlimited
liability for torts in the navigation of their ships and the
courts are bound to presume, in the absence of suitable
pleadings and proof to the contrary, that such is still the
state of the British law. Matter of Huss, 126 N. Y. 537,

There have been two sorts of British acts regulating
the liability of shipowners for torts happening without
personal fault on their part: (a) those that regulate the liability of shipowners for loss or destruction of goods on
board their ships, owing to fire or to robbery or to embezzlement, and (b) those that limit the liability of shipowners
for torts generally.
In respect of fire, robbery, or embezzlement, Parliament referred to "any ship or vessel" in the acts of 7 Geo.
II, c. 15 (1734), and 26 Geo. III, c. 86 (1786), and to "any
sea-going ship" in the act of 17 & 18 Vict., c. 104; M. S. A.,
1854, § 504, and (for greater clearness, Temperley, 2d ed.,

By leave of court Mr. Howard S. Harrington,Mr. Henry

also Mr. A. Gordon Murray and Mr. Benjamin Micou, Mr.
Richard P. Whiteley and Mr. George S. Graham.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes here upon a certificate from the Circuit
Court of Appeals. The facts stated are as follows, with
slight abbreviation. The Titanic, a British steamship,
which had sailed from Southampton, England, on her
maiden voyage for New York, collided on the high seas
with an iceberg, on April 14, and sank the next morning,
with the -loss of many lives and total loss of vessel, cargo,
personal effects, mails and everything connected with the
ship except certain life boats. The owner, alleging that
the loss was occasioned and incurred without its privity
or knowledge, filed a petition for limitation of its liability
under the laws of the United States, Rev. Stats., §§ 4283,
4284, 4285, and Admiralty Rules 54 and 56. 210 U. S.
562, 564. Before it did so a number of actions to recover
for loss of life and personal injuries resulting from the
disaster had been brought against the petitioners in Federal and state courts. The persons who sustained loss
were of many different nationalities, including citizens of
the United States. Mellor, a British subject, excepted to
the petition, on the ground that 'the acts by reason of
which .and for which [the petitioner] claims limitation of
liability took place on board a British registered vessel on
the high seas' and therefore the law of the United States
would not apply. Anderson, a citizen of the United States,
excepted on the ground that the law of the United States

could not and that of England was not shown to apply.
The District Court dismissed the petition as to these.two.
209 Fed. Rep. 501. The petitioner appealed, and the Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following questions:
A. Whether in the case of a disaster upon the high seas,
where (1) only a single vessel of British nationality is concerned and there are claimants of many different nationalities; and where (2) there is nothing before the court to
show what, if any, is the law of the foreign country to
which the vessel belongs, touching the owner's liability for
such disaster,-such owner can maintain a proceeding
under §§ 4283, 4284 and 4285 U. S. Revised Statutes and
the 54th and 56th Rules in Admiralty?
B. Whether, if in such a case it appears that the law of
the foreign country to which the vdssel belongs makes
provision for the limitation of the vessel owner's liability,
upon terms and conditions different from those prescribed
in the Statutes of this country, the owner of such foreign
vessel can maintain a proceeding in the courts of the
United States, under said Statutes and Rules?
In the event of the answer to question B being in the
Affirmative,
C. Will the courts of the United States in such proceeding enforce the law of the United States or of the foreign
country in respect to the amount of such owner's liability?
The general proposition that a foreign ship may resort
to the courts of the United States for a limitation of liability'under Rev. Stat., § 4283 is established. The Scotland,
105 U. S. 24. La Bourgogne, 210 U. S. 95. These were
cases respectively of collisions between American and English and English and French vessels. See also The Chattahoochee, 173 U. S. 540. The Germanic, 196 U. S. 589, 598.
But it is argued that there is an exception in a case like this,
where only a single foreign ship is concerned. The argument is supported by a quotation from Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland, to the effect that if a collision occurred

on the high seas between two vessels belonging to the
same. nation the court would determine the controversy
by the law of their flag. For, it is said, if the foreign law
would govern in that case it must govern in this, and therefore at least in the absence of allegations bringing the case
within the foreign law, the petition must be dismissed.
If, in the observation referred to, Mr. Justice Bradley had
been speaking of proceedings of this class it would be important as sanctioning the view that the United States
courts offered a forum concursus for the administration of
other systems as well as of our own; but we apprehend
that he was speaking of an ordinary collision case and
merely indicating that in such a case the principle usually
governing foreign torts would apply. That principle may
be accepted as equally governing here but it does not carry
us far.
It is true that the act of Congress does not control or
profess to control the conduct of a British ship on the high
seas. See American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213
U. S. 347, 356. It is true that the foundation for a recovery upon a British tort is an obligation created by British
law. But it also is true that the laws of the forum may
decline altogether to enforce that obligation on the ground
that it is contrary to the domestic policy, or may decline
to enforce it except within such limits as it may impose.
Cuba Railroad Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 47$, 480.
Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 2d ed., 647. It is competent
therefore for Congress-to enact that in certain mattdrs belonging to admiralty jurisdiction parties resorting to our
courts shall recover only to such extent or in such way as
it may mark out.. Butler v. Boston & Savannah Steamship
Co., 130 U. S. 527. The question is not whether the owner
of the Titanic by this proceeding can require all claimants
to come in and can cut down rights vested under English
law, as against, for instance, Englishmen living in England
who do not appear. It is only whether-those who do see

fit to sue in this country are limited in their recovery irrespective of the English l'aw. That they are so limited results in our opinion from the decisions of this court. For
on what ground was the limitation of liability allowed in
The Scotland or La Bourgogne? Not on their being subject
to the act of Congress or any law of the United States in
their conduct-but if not on that ground then it must
have been because our statute permits a foreign vessel to
limit its liability according to the act when sued in the
United States. There may be some little uncertainty in
the language of Mr. Justice Bradley in the earlier case. A
slight suggestion that the statute is applied because of a
vacuum,-the absence of any law properly governing the
transaction. But it was no necessary part of his argument
that people were to be made liable after the event by the
mere choice of a forum; and if they were it would not be
because of the act of Congress. That does not impose
but only limits the liability-a liability assumed already
to exist on other grounds. The essential point was that
the limitation might be applied to foreign ships if sued in
this country although they were not subject to our substantive law.
It is not necessary to consider whether, the act of Congress may not limit the rights of shippers or American
vessels to recover for injuries in our waters or on the high
seas, so that if they sued in a foreign court they could not
be allowed to recover more than the act allows, if our construction of the law' were followed. A law that limits a
right in one case may limit a remedy in another. This,
statute well might be held to announce a general policy,
governing both obligations that arise within the jurisdiction and suits that are brought in the courts of the United
States. Emery v. Burbank, 163 Massachusetts, 326, 328.
It clearly limits the remedy, as we have shown, in cases
where it has nothing to sdy about the rights. - With the
explanation that we have made we may repeat here Jus-

tice Bradley's words: "The rule of limited responsibility
is now our maritime rule. It is the rule by which, through
the Act of Congress, we have announced that we propose
to administer justice in maritime cases."
We see no absurdity in supposing that if the owner
of
the Titanic were sued in different countries, each having a
different rule affecting the remedy there, the local rule
should be applied in each case. It can be imagined that
in consequence of such diverse proceedings the owner
might not be able to comply with the local requirements
for limitation, as it also is conceivable that if it sought
the advantage of an alien law it might as a condition have
to pay more than its liability under the law of its flag in
some cases. But the imagining of such possible difficulties
is no sufficient reason for not applying the statute as it
has been construed;.on the whole, it would seem with good
effect.
It follows from what we have said that the first two
questions must be answered in the affirmative and the
third, the law of the United States.
Answers: A, Yes.
B, Yes.
C, The law of the United
States.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA considers it a proper deduction
from The Scotland that the law of the foreign country
should be enforced in respect of the amount of the owner's
liability.
