A statute which fixes the annual sslary of a public officer at a designated
sum without limitation as to time is not abrogated or suspended by
subsequent enactments which merely appropriate a less amount for
that officer for particular years and which contain no words expressly,
or by clear implication, modifying or repealing the previous law.

The provision in the appropriation acts of 1906 and 1907 excepting

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson for the United
States:

Congress had the power to repeal general salary or compensation acts through special appropriation acts. When
such a repeal is claimed the question is determined by the
intention of Congress. United States v. Fisher, 109 U. S.
143; United States v. Mitchell, 109 U. S. 146; Matthews v.
United States, 123 U. S. 184; Wallace v. United States, 133

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Argument for the United States.

233 U. S.

The army appropriation act of April 23, 1904, was intended to redefine the definition of "foreign stations"
given in the act of June 30, 1902, so as to exclude Porto
Rico and Hawaii; it repealed the act of June 30, 1902, to
that extent. See H., Rept. No. 4644, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.,
p. 3, vol. 4908; H. Repts. (public), 59th Cong., 1st Sess.;
S. Rept. No. 1199, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8, vol. 4573,
S. Repts. (public); 38 Cong. Rec., 58th Cong., II, pt. 4,
pp. 3906, 3907, and pt. 5, pp. 4406-4470; Irwin v. United
States, 38 Ct. Cls. 87, 98.
The cases relied on by the Court of Claims and cited in
its opinion are not opposed to this conclusion. As to
Langston v. United States, 118 U. S. 389, see Belknap v.
United States, 150 U. S. 588, 595; and as to Converse v.
United States, 26 Ct. Cls. 6, see Carden v. United States,
45 Ct. Cls. 171, 176.
Service beyond the limits of the States comprising the
Union and the Territories of the United States contiguous
thereto shall be as now provided by law under the act of
May 11, 1908, 35 Stat. 110, and did not include service in
Porto Rico or Hawaii.
The act of June 12, 1906, having been construed by the
comptroller and the act of May 11, 1908, having been prepared with reference to the act of 1906, so far as the definition of foreign stations was concerned, must necessarily
refer back to the territorial definition of foreign stations
as set forth in the act of 1906 and as construed by the
comptroller. Sessions v. Romadka, 145 U. S. 41, 42;
Claflin & Others v. Commonwealth Ins. Co., 110 U. S.81;
The "A bbotsford," 98 U. S. 440; Plummer v. United States,
224 U. S.137, 140.
The army appropriation acts of 1909, 1910, and 1911,
respectively, simply make appropriation for services outside the limits of the United States and the Territories
contiguous thereto in conformity with existing law as
construed by the comptroller.

UNITED STATES v. VULTE.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Since the passage of the act of 1906, the accounting
officers of the Treasury have uniformly disallowed increased pay for service in Porto Rico and Hawaii. Such
contemporaneous, uniform, and continuous construction
is, we submit, entitled to great weight and should not be
overruled without cogent reasons. Brown v. United States,
113 U. S. 568; Schells, Executor, v. Fouche, 138 U. S. 562;
Hewitt v. Shultz, 180 U. S. '139; United States v. Healey,
160 U. S. 136; United States v. Sweet, 189 U. S. 471. When
such construction has been approved by Congress, as was
done by the act of 1912, it is conclusive.
Mr. George A. King, with whom Mr. William B. King
was on the brief, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
The appellee, Nelson P. Vulte, filed a petition in the
Court of Claims claiming to be entitled to $299.78, being
ten per cent. of his regular pay for service beyond the
seas. Judgment was entered in his favor for that amount,
and the United States prosecuted this appeal.
The court found the following facts: Vulte was appointed second lieutenant in the Marine Corps June 30,
1903, and was promoted to first lieutenant March 3, 1904.
Under orders assigning him for duty in Porto Rico with
station at San Juan, he sailed from New York for Porto
Rico June 27, 1908, and served there until November 3,
1909, when he was detached and ordered back to the
United States. He was four days on the return
voyage.
If it is held that he is entitled to ten per cent. for services in Porto Rico from the date of sailing from New
York until the date of his detachment from duty at San
Juan, there would accrue to him the sum of $296.72, and

233 U. S.

an additional sum of $3.06 if entitled to pay en route from
Porto Rico to New York.
Vulte's pay was originally fixed by ยง 1612 of the Revised Statutes as follows: "The officers of the Marine
corps shall be entitled to receive the same pay and allowances, and the enlisted men shall be entitled to receive
the same pay and bounty for re~nlisting, as are or may be
provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers and
enlisted men of like grades in the Infantry of the Army."
On June 30, 1902, as part of the appropriation act for
the Army (c. 1328, 32 Stat. 507, 512), Congress modified
existing law respecting the pay proper of officers of this
grade by the following language: "For additional ten per
centum increase on pay of commissioned officers serving
at foreign stations, four hundred and fifty-one thousand,
four hundred and fifty-six dollars: Provided, That hereafter the pay proper of all commissioned officers and enlisted men serving beyond the limits of the States comprising the Union and the Territories of the United-States
contiguous thereto shall be increased ten per centum for
officers and twenty per centum for enlisted men over and
above the rates of pay proper as fixed by law for time of
peace, and the time of such service shall be counted from
the date of departure from said States to the date of return thereto."
As observed by Mr. Justice Booth, delivering the opinion of the Court of Claims: "Thus far the rights of plaintiff [Vulte] respecting pay are obvious; the complications
arise by subsequent legislation."
On June 12, 1906, Congress provided-" for additional
ten per centum increase on pay of commissioned officers
serving beyond the limits of the States comprising the
Union and the Territories of the United States contiguous
thereto (excepting Porto Rico and Hawaii) as provided by
act of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and two, the time
of such service to be counted from the date of departure

Opinion of the Court.

"
from said States to the date of return thereto .
(c. 3078, 34 Stat. 240, 247).
This provision of the act of June 12, 1906, was repeated
in the appropriation act of March 2, 1907, c. 2551, 34
Stat. 1158, 1164. โข
The act of May 11, 1908, provided as follows: "That
increase of pay for service beyond the limits of the States
comprising the Union and the Territories of the United
States contiguous thereto shall be as now provided by
law.
"For additional ten per centum increase on pay of
officers on foreign service, two hundred and eighty-five
thousand dollars.
"That nothing herein contained shall be construed so
as to reduce the pay or allowances now authorized by
law for any officer or enlisted man of the Army; and all
laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of
this act are hereby repealed." C. 163, 35 Stat. 106, 110,
114.
The short point in the case is to what the words "shall
be as now provided by law" in the act of May 11, 1908,
refer-whether to the acts of 1906 and 1907, or more
liDfitedly, we may say, to the exceptions of Porto Rico
and Hawaii in those acts, or to the proviso in the act of
June 30, 1902, supra. In other words, whether the exceptions of those years of those special places shall prevail
over the substantive provision of the act of June 30, 1902,
supra, which is explicit, of enduring effect, and is besides
comprehensive of all foreign stations, its language being"That hereafter the pay proper of all commissioned
serving beyond the limits of the States
.
officbrs
shall be increased ten per centum. . . ."
The Government contends for the exceptions as constituting new law, not as a temporary condition under an

old one. The claimant contends for the proviso of the
act of 1902, and counsel, in quite elaborate arguments,
have supported their respective contentions. We shall
not follow the details of their arguments. The question
presented, we think, is in brief compass. Congress manifestly did not think that by the first instance of the
exception, that in the act of 1906, it had done more than
temporarily suspend as to Porto Rico and Hawaii the act
of June 30, 1902. The exception was repeated in 1907.
If the first exception was not, intended to affect permanently the act of 1902, why should such intention be
ascribed to the' second exception-or to both, neither
having words of prospective extension, and, without such
words, naturally having only temporary operation? It
would be extreme to say that by making them Congress
considered that it had established a policy which could be
confidently referred to as having the status and effect of
permanent law.
The exceptions, it is to be remembered, were in appropriation acts and no words were used to indicate any other
purpose than the disbursement of a sum of money for
the particular fiscal years. This court has had occasion to
deal with such instances of legislation and their intended
effect on existing law. In United States v. Langston,
118 U. S. 389, 394, it was decided that a statute which
fixed the annual salary of a public officer at a designated
sum without limitation as to time is not abrogated or
suspended by subsequent enactments which merely appropriate a less amount for that officer for particular
years, and which contained no words that expressly or
by clear implication modified or repealed the previous
law. See also Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445,
where it is said: "It would be somewhat unusual to find
engrafted upon an act making special and temporary
appropriation, any provision which was t6 have a general
and permanent application to all future appropriations.

UNITED STATES v. FOSTER.
233 U. S.

Syllabus.

Nor ought such an intention on the part of the legislature
to be presumed, unless it is expressed in the mostclear and
positive terms, and where the language admits of no other
reasonable interpretation." This follows naturally from
the nature of appropriation bills, and the presumption
hence arising is fortified by the rules of the Senate and '
House of Representatives.
The ruling in the' Langston and Minis Cases is not opposed by the cases cited by the Government. In all of
them there was something more than the mere omission
to appropriate a sufficient sum. There were expressions
indicating a broader purpose. In two of them, United
States v. Fisher,109 U. S. 143, and United States v. Mitchell,
109 U. S. 146, it was intimated that the law was only
suspended for the particular -years. In another, Wallace v.
United States, 133 U. S.180, it was held that the appropriation constituted the law which prescribed the compensation of the office. And in all of them the Langston Case was
referred to and not disturbed or modified.
Judgment affirmed.

Argued April 13, 14, 1914.-Decided May 4, 1914.

Where the case is one of statutory construction, consideration of the
statute becomes necessary, f nd if the validity of departmental
regulations is involved, a construction of the statute authorizing the
head of the Department to niake them is also necessary, and this
court has jurisdiction under the Criminal -Appeals Act of 1907 to
review the judgment sustaining a demurrer to the indictment.
,The theory of the act of March 3, 1883, is that every postmaster shall
receive a salary dependent upon and regulated by the amount of
business done at his office as represented by normal and natural-nol
unlawfully induced-sales of stamps.
