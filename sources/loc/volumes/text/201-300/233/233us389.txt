GERMAN ALLIANCE INSURANCE COMPANY v.
LEWIS, SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE OF
THE STATE OF KANSAS.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DIST:[ICT OF KANSAS.
No. 120.

Argued December 10, 1913.-Decided April 20, 1914.

The business of insurance is so far affected with a public interest as to
justify legislative regulation of its rates.
A public interest can exist in a business, such as insurance, distinct
from a public use of property, and can be the basis of the power of
the legislature to regulate the personal contracts involved in such
business.
Where a business, such as insurance, is affected by a public use, it is
the business that is the fundamental thing; property is but the instrument of such business.
Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113; Budd v. New York, 143 U. S. 517; Brass
v. North Dakota, 153 U. S. 391, demonstrate that a business by circumstances and its nature may rise from private to public concern
and consequently become subject to governmental regulation; and

the business of insurance falls within this principle.
The fact that a contract for insurance is one for indemnity and is personal, does not preclude regulation.
A general conception of the law-making bodies of the country that a
business requires governmental regulation is not accidental and cannot exist without cause.
What makes for the general welfare is matter of legislative judgment,
and judicial review is limited to power and excludes policy.
The liberty of contract guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
not more intimately involved in price regulation than in other proper
forms of regulation of business and property affected by a public
use, and so held as to the regulation of rates of fire insurance.
The inactivity of a governmental power, no matter how prolonged, does
not militate against its legality when exercised. United States v.
Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366.
Whether rate regulation is necessary in regard to a particular business
affected by a public use, such as insurance, is matter for legislative

judgment. This court can only determine whether the legislature
has the power to enact it.
A discrimination is not invalid under the equal protection provisionof the Fourteenth Amendment if not so arbitrary as to be beyond
the wide discretion that a legislature may exercise; and so held as
to a classification exempting farmers' mutual insurance companies
doing only a farm business from the operation of an act regulating
rates of insurance.
A legislative classification may rest on narrow distinctions. Legislation
is addressed to evils as they appear and even degrees of evil may determine its exercise. Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union National Bank, 207
U. S. 251.
The Kansas statute of 1909, so far as it provides for regulating rates
of fire insurance, is not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth
Amendment as depriving insurance companies of their property
without due process of law, as abridging the liberty of contract or
as denying companies charging regular premiums the equal protection of the law by excepting farmers' mutual insurance companies
from its operation.

BILL in equity to restrain the enforcement of the provisions of an act of the State of Kansas entitled "An act
relating to Fire Insurance, and to provide for the Regulation and Control of rates of Premium Thereon, and to
Prevent Discriminations Therein." Chap. 152 of the
Session Laws of 1909.
The grounds of the bill are that the act offends the Constitution of the State and of the United States.
A summary of the requirements of the act is as follows:
Sec. 1. Every fire insurance conpany shall file with the
superintendent of insurance general basis schedules showing the rates on all risks insurable by such company in
the State and all the conditions which affect the rates or
the value of the insurance to the assured.
Sec. 2. No change shall be made in the schedules except
after ten days' notice to the superintendent, which notice
shall state the changes proposed and the time when they

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.

391

Statement, of the Case.

shall go into effect. The superintendent may allow changes
upon less notice.
Sec. 3. When the superintendent shall determine any
rate is excessive or unreasonably high or not adequate to
the safety or soundness of the company, he is authorized
to direct the company to publish and file a higher or a
lower rate, which shall be commensurate with the character
of the risk; but in every case the rate shall be reasonable.
Sec. 4. No company shall engage or participate in insurance on property located in the State until the schedules
of rates be filed nor write insurance at a different rate
than the rate named in the schedules, or refund or remit
in any manner or by any device any portion of the. rates;
or extend to any insured or other person apy privileges,
inducements or concessions except as specified in the
schedules.
Sec. 5. Any company making insurance where no rate
has been filed shall, within thirty days after entering into
such contract, file with the superintendent a schedule of
such property showing the rate and such information as
he may require. The schedule shall conform to the general basis of schedules and shall constitute the permanent
rate of the company.
Sec. 6. The schedules shall be open to the inspection of
the public, and each local agent shall have and exhibit
to the public copies thereof relative to all risks upon which
he is authorized to write insurance.
Sec. 7. No company shalldirectly or indirectly, by any
special rate or by any device, charge or receive from any
person a different rate of compensation for insurance
than it charges or receives from any other person for like
insurance or risks of a like kind and hazard under similar
circumstances and conditions in the State. Any company
violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of unjust
discrimination, which is declared unlawful.
Sec. 8. The superintendent may, if he finds that any

company, or any officer, agent or representative thereof,
has violated any of the provisions of the act, revoke the
license of such offending company, officer, or agent, but
such revocation shall not affect liability for the violation
of any other section of the act; and provided that any
action, decision or determination of the superintendent under the provisions of the act shall be subject to review
by the courts of the State as provided in the act.
Sec. 9. The superintendent shall give notice of any order
or regulation made by him under the act, and any company, or any person, city or municipality which shall be
interested, shall have the right within thirty days to bring
an action against the superintendent in any district court
of the State to have the order or regulation vacated.
Issues shall be formed and the controversy tried and determined as in other cases of a civil nature, and the court
may set aside one or more or any part of any of the regulations or orders which the court shall find to be unreasonable, unjust, excessive or inadequate to compensate the
company writing insurance thereon for the risk assumed
by it, without disturbing others. The order of the superintendent shall not be suspended or enjoined, but the court
may permit the complaining company to write insurance
at the rates which obtained prior to such order upon the
condition that the difference in the rates shall be deposited
with the superintendent to be paid to the company or to
the holders of policies as, on final determination of the
suit, the court may deem just and reasonable. During
the pendency of the suit no penalties or forfeitures shall
attach or accrue on account of the failure of the complainant to comply with the order sought to be vacated or
modified until the final determination of the suit. Proceedings in error may be instituted in the Supreme Court
of the State as in other civil cases, and that court shall
examine the record, including the evidence, and render
such judgment m shall be just and equitable. No action

shall be 1 rought in the United States courts until the
remedies provided by the act shall have been exhausted.
If any'company organized under the laws of the State or
authorized to transact busiaess in the State shall violate
the section, the superintendent may cancel the authority
of the company to transact business inthe State.
Sec. 10. Infractions of the act are declared to be misdemeanors and punishable by a fine not exceeding $100
for each offense, provided that if the conviction be for an
unlawful discrimination the punishment may be by a
fine or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding
ninety days, or by both fine and imprisonment.
Sec. 11. No person shall be excused from testifying at
the trial of any other person on the ground that the testimony may incriminate him, but he shall not be prosecuted
on account of any transaction about which he may testify,
except for perjury committed in so testifying; "provided,
that nothing in this act shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies organized and doing business under
the laws of this State and insuring only farm property.'
The bill alleged that it was brought by the German
Alliance Insurance Compsay in behalf of itself and all
other companies and corporations conducting a similar
business and similarly situated, and that Charles W.
Barnes was the duly elected superintendent of fire insurance of the State of Kansms. It alleged the jurisdictional
amount, and that 'the controversy was one arising under
the Constitution of the United States and of the State of
Kansas. It alleged, further, the following facts, which we
state in narrative form, omitting those which relate to
the constitution of the State, no assignment of error being
based upon them: The appellant, to which we shall refer
as complainant, was incorporated under the laws of New
York as a fire insurance company in 1879 and immediately
entered upon such business, and it has for long periods of

time conducted the business of fire insurance in Kansas
and other States of the United States.
The business of fire insurance as conducted by it consists of making indemnity contracts against direct loss or
damage by fire for a consideration paid, known as a premium; that the rate or premium is the amount charged
for each $100 of indemnity. The property which is the
subject of insurance is ordinarily known and designated
as the risk. Complainant issues indemnity contracts or
fire insurance policies covering all kinds and descriptions
of improvements upon real estate and the contents thereof
and all kinds and descriptions of personal property and
also farm houses, barns and granaries and their contents. The rate of premium varies with the kind of property covered, its physical characteristics and situation,
its exposure, the presence or absence of .fire protection,
and many other causes.
The establishment of the basis rate for the premium
to be charged is a matter of technical and mathematical
deduction from the experience of all fire insurance companies covering a long period of years and, territorially,
the whole civilized world. To make such deduction it is
necessary not only to be in possession of the compiled
statistics of fire insurance business, but also to be skilled
in the mathematical 'theory of probabilities' and in the
'law of large numbers' so as to be able to apply with technical accuracy such laws and such data,. and that no
one not specially trained as an insurance statistician is
competent to make such deductions.
A theoretically correct basis rate having thus been
arrived at is subject to variation according to the risk,
whether in town or ountry, and, if in the former, according to the class of town or city in which it is situated. The
classification of towns and cities depends upon water
supply, fire protection and general physical conditions.
In addition to ascertaining the individual risk, if a build-

ing, the size, material of which and the manner in which
it is constructed, the character of the occupancy, and the
character of the occupancy and construction of adjacent
buildings, also the character of the contents of the buildings and the manner in which they are stored and the precautions used to detect and prevent fires, are necessary to
be ascertained.
Complainant and othes engaged in the insurance
business employ a large number of men skilled as inspectors to report upon individual risks, and it is impossible
to fix and adjust a reasonable rate of premium for each
and every individual risk without the information so obtained and having the same applied by experts. And
such training and information are necessary to determine
whether a basic rate or actual rate as applied to any
particular risk is or is not reasonable, and the respondent
is not possessed of the requisite information or special
training necessary to qualify for such determination and
any conclusion to which he might come would be a mere
guess or arbitrary determination; and the provisions of the
act can only be properly administered in any event by the
employment by the State of a corps of inspectors and experts specially trained in the business of fixing rates of
fire insurance.
The complainant has complied with all of the laws of the
State and has received the regular license or authorization of the State, to transact the business of fire insurance
therein.
It conducts its business by means of resident agents, of
which it has seventy-two directly employed; it has a large
and valuable established business to secure which it has
expended a large sum of money, and to be compelled to
give up its business would result in irreparable damage
and injury to it. A large ruimber of the fire insurance
policies issued by complain;nt are written upon farm
buildings and their contents and in writing such business

it comes into direct, competition with various farmers'
mutual insurance companies organized and doing business
under the laws of the State and insuring only farm property.
The business of fire insurance is purely and exclusively a
private business and may be transacted by private persons in their individual capacity or by unincorporated
or incorporated companies, that the amount of indemnity
and the premium is a matter or private negotiation and
agreement, and the act of the legislature of the State of
Kansas attempts to regulate the business in so far as the
fixing of the rate of premium is concerned and in the
attempted regulation distinguishes between fire insurance
companies and individuals and partnerships, and thereby
denies to complainant and other companies the equal
protection of the law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and is
therefore unconstitutional and void.
Under the laws of Kansas, mutual fire insurance companies may be organized, that such companies having a
guaranteed fund of $25,000 may do business on a cash
basis and accept premiums in cash and that such premium
measures the total liability of the insured under the policy
either to the company or to its creditors; that by the
eleventh section of the act under review, it is provided
'that nothing in this act shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized and doing business under the
laws of this State, and insuring only farm property.' The
complainant and many other companies insure farm property and come into direct competition with farmers' mutual
companies of the character specified and the act of the legislature in excepting the latter companies deprives complainant of the equal protection of the laws and is therefore repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and is unconstitutional and
void.

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.

Statement of the Case.

The business of fire insurance is private, with which the
State has no right to interfere, and the right to fix by
private contract the rate of premium is a property right
of value; the business is not a monopoly either legally or
actually, it may not be legally conducted by the National
Government or by the State of Kansag or other States
under their respective constitutions, and is not a business
included within the functions of government. Neither
complainant nor others engaged in fire insurance receive
or enjoy from the State of Kansas, or any government,
state or national, any privilege or immunity not in like
manner and to like extent received and enjoyed by all other
persons, partnerships and companies, incorporated or unincorporated, respectively, engaged in the conduct of other
lines of private business and enterprises. Complainant,
therefore, is deprived of one of the incidents of liberty and
of its property without due process of law, in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States.
The act distinguishes between fire insurance companies
and other insurance companies, individuals and persons
and distinguishes between insurance and other lines of
business and thereby offends the equality clause of the
Constitution of the United States.
Complainant, under protest, filed the general basis
schedules of its rates as required by the act, which were
arrived at by the process hereinbefore set out. On the
nineteenth of August, 1909, respondent made a reduction
of 12% from the rates as filed and from the rates filed by
other companies, with the proviso that it should not apply
to residence property, churches, school houses, farm property or special hazards. The order was to become effective September 1, 1909. And it was further ordered
that on and after that date the exception of churches and
dwelling houses should be eliminated. Complainant notified the superintendent by letter that it would, under-

233 U. S.

protest, and reserving the rights which it had under the
law, comply with the provisions of the order.
The risks included in the order and not excepted therefrom, comprise all ordinary mercantile risks in the State
and that the reduction of 12% will result in a rate which is
much less than the cost of carrying the risks.
Respondent is threatening to make further reductions
and it is proposed to revoke the license of any fire insurance company which may violate the provisions of the
act, even though the rates fixed by him may be so low as
to be confiscatory and to inflict upon the officers of the
company, including complainant, the penalties prescribed
for such violation, and such companies and complainant,
unless defendant be restrained by injunction, will be
obliged to comply with the requirements of the act to
their irreparable damage and injury.
Complainant finally alleges that it is not its purpose to
attack the orders of respondent on the ground that they
were not made in strict compliance with the provisions
of the act, but to have the act in its entirety declared to
be unconstitutional and void for the reasons alleged, and
to have respondent restrained and orders made by im
under the provisions of the act enjoined. And such an
injunction is prayed.
Respondent filed a demurrer stating that he demurred
to so much of the bill as charges the act of the State of
Kansas to be repugnant to the constitution of Kansas
and the Constitution of the United States. The demurrer was sustained. Subsequently, upon the bill being
amended, a general demurrer was filed, which was also
sustained by the court, and the bill dismissed. Prior,
however, to this action, it having been suggested that the
term of office of Charles W. Barnes as superintendent of
insurance had expired and that Ike Lewis had succeeded to
that office and to all of its duties and powers, he was made
defendant in the place and stead of- Charles W. Barnes.

The State has not the power to fix the rates charged to
the public either by corporations or individuals engaged

public or not is whether a public trust is imposed upon the
property, and whether the public has a legal right to the
use which cannot be denied. Allen v. Jay, 60 Maine, 124;

After stating the case as above, MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of thb court.
The specific error complained of is the refusal of the
District Court to hold that the act of the State of Kansas
is unconstitutional and void as offending the due process
clause Of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution
of the United States. To support this charge of error,

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.
233 U. S.

405

Opinion of the Court.

complainant asserts that the business of fire insurance is a
private business and, therefore, there is no constitutional
power in a State to fix the rates and charges for services
rendered by it. An exercise of such right, it is contended,
is a taking of private property for a public use. The contention is made in various ways and, excluding possible
countervailing contentions, it is urged that the act under,
review cannot be justified as an exercise of the police
power or of the power of the State to admit foreign corporations within its borders upon such terms as it may
prescribe, or'of any other power possessed by the State;
that no State has the power to impose unconstitutional
burdens either upon private citizens or private corporations engaged in a private business.
, The basic contention is that the business of insurance
is a natural right, receiving no privilege from the State,
is voluntarily entered into, cannot be compelled nor can
any of its exercises be compelled; that it concerns personal contracts of indemnity against certain contingencies
merely. Whether such contracts shall be made at all, it is
contended, is a. matter of private negotiation and agreement, and necessarily there must be freedom in fixing their
terms. And "where the right to demand and receive
service does not exist in the public, the correlative right
of regulation as to rates and charges does not exist."
Many elements, it is urged, determine the extending or
rejection of insurance; the hazards are relative and depend
upon many circumstances upon which there may be different judgments, and there are personal considerations
as well-" moral hazards," as they are called.
It is not clear to what extent some of these circumstances
are urged as affecting the power of regulation in the State.
It would seem to be urged that each risk is individual and
no rule of rates can be formed or applied. The bill asserts the contrary. It in effect admits that there can be
standards and classification of risks, determined by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

law of averages. Indeed, it is a matter of common knowledge that rates are fixed and accommodated to those standards and classification in pre-arranged schedules, and,
granted the rates may be varied in particular instances,
they are sufficiently definite and applicable as a general
and practically constant rule. They are the product, it is
true, of skill and experience, but such skill and experience
a regulating body may have as well as the creating body.
Indeed, an allegation in the original bill that the superintendent of insurance could not have the requisite technical
and mathematical training to determine whether a basic
rate or an actual rate as applied to any particular risk
was or was not reasonable and that his conclusion, therefore, "would be a mere guess or arbitrary determination"
was omitted by an amendment. It would indeed be a
strained contention that the Government could not avail
itself, in the exercise of power it might deem wise to
exert, of the skill and knowledge possessed by the world.
We may put aside, therefore, all merely adventitious considerations and come to the bare and essential one, whether
a contract of fire insurance is private and as such has constitutional immunity from regulation. Or, to state it
differently and to express an antithetical proposition, is
the business of insurance so far affected with a public
interest as to justify legislative regulation of its rates?
And we mean a broad and definite public interest. In
some degree the public interest is concerned in every transaction between men, the sum of the transactions constituting the activities of life. But there is something more
special than this, something of: more definite consequence,
which makes the public interest that justifies regulatory
legislation. We can best explain by examples. The
transportation of property-business of common carriers-is obviously of public concern and its regulation is
an accepted governmental power. The transmission of
intelligence is of cognate character. There are other

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.
233 U. S.

407

Opinion of the Court.

utilities which are denominated public, such as the furnishing of water and light, including in the latter gas and
electricity. We do not hesitate at their regulation nor at
the fixing of the prices which may be charged for their
service. The basis of the ready concession of the power
of regulation is the public interest. This is not denied,
but its application to insurance is so far denied as not to
extend to the fixing of rates. It is said, the State has no
power to fix the rates charged to the public by either
corporations or individuals engaged in a private business,
and the "test of whether the use is public or not is whether
a public trust is imposed upon the property and whether
the public has a legal right to the use which cannot be
denied;" or, as we have said, quoting counsel, "Where the
right to demand and receive service does not exist in the
public, the correlative right of regulation as to rates and
charges does not exist." Cases are cited which, it must
be admitted, support the contention. The distinction is
artificial. It is, indeed, but the assertion that the cited
examples embrace all cases of public interest. The complainant explicitly so contends, urging that the test it
applies excludes the idea that there can be a public interest which gives the power of regulation as distinct from
a public use which, necessarily, it is contended, can only
apply to property, not to personal contracts. The distinction, we think, has no basis in principle (Noble State Bank
v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104), nor has the other contention
that the service which cannot be demanded cannot be
regulated.
Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, is an instructive example
of legislative power exerted in the public interest. The
constitution of Illinois declared all elevators or storehouses, where grain or other property was stored for a
compensation, to be public warehouses, and a law was
subsequently enacted fixing rates of storage. In other
words, that which had been private property had from its

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

233 U. S.

uses become, it was declared, of, public concern and the
compensation to be charged for its use prescribed. The
law was sustained against the contention that it deprived
the owners of the warehouses of their property without
due process of law. We can only cite the case and state
its principle, not review it at .any length. The principle
was expressed to be, quoting Lord Chief Justice Hale,
"that when private property is 'affected with a public
interest it ceases to be juris privati' only" and it becomes
"clothed with a public interest when used in a manner
to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large"; and, so using it, the owner "grants to the
public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good." And it was
said that the application of the principle could not be
denied because no precedent could be found for a statute
precisely like the one reviewed. It presented a case, the
court further said, "for the application of a long-known
and well-established principle in social science, and this
statute simply extends the law so as to meet this new
development of commercial progress." The principle was
expressed as to property, and the instance of its application was to property, but it is manifestly broader than
that instance. It is the business that is the fundamental
thing; property is but its instrument, the means of rendering the service which has become of public interest.
That the case had broader application than'the use of
property is manifest from the grounds expressed in the
dissenting opinion. The basis of the opinion was that the
businqss regulated was private and had "no special privilege connected with it, nor did the law ever extend to it
any greater protection than it extended to all other private
business." The argument encountered opposing examples, among others, the regulation of the rate of interest
on money. The regulation was accounted for on the
ground that the act of Parliament permitting the charging

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.
233 U.. S.

409

Opinion of the Court.

of some interest was a relaxation of a prohibition of the
common law against charging any interest, but this explanation overlooked the fact that both the common law
and the act of Parliament were exercises of government
regulation of a strictly private business in the interest of
public policy, a policy which still endures and still dictates
regulating laws. Against that conservatism of the mind,
which puts to question every new act of regulating legislation and regards the legislation invalid or dangerous
until it has become familiar, government-state and National-has pressed on in the general welfare; and our
reports are full of. cases where in instance after instance the
exercise of regulation was resisted and yet sustained
against attacks asserted to be justified by the Constitution
of the United States. The dread of the moment having
passed, no one is now heard to say that rights were restrained or their constitutional guaranties impaired.
Munn v. Illinois was approved in many state decisions,
but it was brought to the review of this court in Budd v.
New York, 143 U. S. 517, and its doctrine, after elaborate
consideration, re-affirmed, and against the same arguments
which are now urged against the Kansas statute. Nowhere have these arguments been, or could be, advanced
with greater strength and f'elicity of expression than in the
dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer. Every consideration was adduced, based on the private character of the
business regulated and, for that reason, its constitutional
immunity from regulation, with all the power of argument
and illustration of which that great judge was a master.
The considerations urged did not prevail. Against them
the court opposed the ever-existing police power in government and its necessary exercise for the public good and
declared its entire accommodation to the limitations of the
Constitution. The court was not deterred by the charge
(repeated in the case at bar) that its decision had the
sweeping -and dangerous comprehension of subjecting to

233 U. S.

legislative regulation all of the businesses and affairs of
life and the prices oL all commodities. Whether we may
apprehend such result by extending the principle of the
cases to fire insurance we shall presently consider.
In Brass v. Stoeser, 153 U. S. 391, Munn v. Illinois and
Budd v. New York were affirmed. A law of the State of
North Dakota was sustained which made all buildings,
elevators and warehouses used for the handling of grain
for a profit public warehouses, and fixed a storage rate.
The case is important. It extended the principle of the
other two cases and denuded it of the limiting element
which was supposed to beset it-that to justify regulation
of a business -the business must have a monopolistic
character. That distinction was pressed and answered.
It was argued, the court said (p. 402), "that the statutes
of Illinois and New York [passed on in the Munn and Budd
Cases] are intended to operate in great trade centers,
where, on account of the business being localized in the
hands of a few persons in close proximity to each other,
great opportunities for combinations to raise and control
elevating and storage charges are afforded, while the
wide extent of the State of North Dakota and the small
population of its country towns and villages are said to
present no such opportunities." And it was also urged
that the method of carrying on business in North Dakota
.and the Eastern cities was different, that the elevators in
the latter were essentially means of transporting grain
from the lakes to the railroads and those who owned them
could, if uncontrolled by law, extort such charges as they
pleased, and stress was laid upon the expression in the
other cases which represented the business as a practical
monopoly. A contrast was made between those conditions
and those which existed in an agricultural State where
land was cheap and limitless in quantity. It was replied
that this difference in conditions was "for those who
make, not for those who interpret, the laws," And con-

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.

411

Opinion of the Court.

sidering the expressions in the other cases which, it was
said, went rather to the expediency of the laws, than to
their validity, yet, it was further said, the expressions had
their value because the "obvious aim of the reasoning that
prevailed was to show that the subject-matter of these
enactments fell within the legitimate sphere of legislative
power, and that, so far as the laws and Constitution of the
United States were concerned, the legislation in question
deprived no person of his property without due process of
law" (p. 404).
The cases need no explanatory or .fortifying comment.
They demonstrate that, a business, by circumstances and
its nature, may rise from private to be of public concern
and be subject, in consequence, to governmental regulation. And they demonstrate, to apply the language of
Judge Andrews in People v. Budd (117 N. Y. 1, 27), that
the attempts made to place the right of public regulation
in the cases in which it has been exerted, and of which
we have given examples, upon the ground of special
privilege conferred by the public on those affected cannot
be supported. "The under]ying principle is that business
of certain kinds holds such a peculiar relation to the public
interests that there is supe:rinduced upon it the right of
public regulation." Is the business of insurance within
the principle? It would be a bold thing to say that the
principle is fixed, inelastic, in the precedents of the past
and cannot be applied though modern economic conditions
may make necessary or beneficial its application. In other
words, to say that government possessed at one time a
greater power to recognize the public interest in a business
and its regulation to promote the general welfare than
government possesses to-day. We proceed then to
consider whether the business of insurance is within the
principle.
A contract for fire insurance is one for indemnity against
loss and is personal. The admission, however, does not

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

take us far in the solution of the question presented. Its
personal character certainly does not of itself preclude
regulation, for there are many examples of governmental
regulation of personal contracts, and in the statutes of
every State in the Union superintendence and control
over the business of insurance are exercised, varying in
details and extent. We need not particularize in detail.
We need only say that there was quite early (in Massachusetts 1837, New York 1853) state provision for what
is known as the unearned premium fund or reserve; then
came the limitation of dividends, the publishing of accounts, valued policies, standards of policies, prescribing
investment, requiring deposits in money or bonds, confining the business to corporations, preventing discrimination in rates, limitation of risks and other regulations
equally restrictive. In other words, the State has stepped
in and imposed conditions upon the companies, restraining
the absolute liberty which businesses strictly private are
permitted to exercise.
Those regulations exhibit it to be the conception of the
law-making bodies of the country without exception that
the business of insurance so far affects the public welfare
as to invoke and require governmental regulation. A
conception so general cannot be without cause. The
universal sense of a people cannot be accidental; its persistence saves it from the charge of unconsidered impulse,
and its estimate of insurance certainly has substantial
basis. Accidental fires are inevitable and the extent of
loss very great. The effect of insurance-indeed, it has
been said to be its fundamental object-is to distribute
the loss over as wide an area as possible. In other words,
the loss is spread over the country, the disaster to an
individual is shared by many, the disaster to a community
shared by other communities; great catastrophes are
thereby lessened, and, it may be, repaired. In assimilation
of insurance to a tax, the companies have been said to be

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.
233 U. S.

413

Opinion of the Court.

the mere machinery by which the inevitable losses by
fire are distributed so as to fall as lightly as possible on the
public at large, the body of the insured, not the companies, paying the tax. Their efficiency, therefore,
and
solvency are of great concern. The other objects, direct
and indirect, of insurance we need not mention. Indeed,
it may be enough to say, without stating other effects of
insurp-nce, that a large part of the country's wealth,
subject to uncertainty of loss through fire, is protected by
insurance. This demonstrates the interest of the public
in it and we need not dispute with the economists that this
is the result of the "substitution of certain for uncertain
loss" or the diffusion of positive loss over a large group of
persons, as we have already said to be certainly one of its
effects. We can see, therefore, how it has come to be
considered a matter of public concern to regulate it, and,
governmental insurance has its advocates and even
examples. Contracts of insurance, therefore, have greater
public consequence than contracts between individuals to
do or not to do a particular thing whose effect stops with
the individuals. We may say in passing that when the
effect goes beyond that, there are many examples of
regulation. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366; Griffith v.
Connecticut, 218 U. S. 563; Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S.
412; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, 222 U. S. 225; Schmidinger v. Chicago, 226 U. S. 578; Chicago, Burlington &
Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549; Noble State
Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104.
Complainant feels the necessity of accounting for
the
regulatory state legislation and refers it to the exertion of
the police power, but, while expressing the power in the
broad language of the cases, seeks to restrict its application. Counsel states that this power may be exerted to
"pass laws whose purpose is the health, safety, morals and
the general welfare of the people." The admission is very
comprehensive. What makes for the general welfare is

necessarily in the first instance a -matter of legislative
judgment and a judicial review of such judgment is limited.
"The scope of judicial inquiry in deciding the question of
power is not to be confused with the scope of legislative
considerations in dealing with the matter of policy.
Whether the enactment is wise or unwise, whether it is
based on sound economic theory, whether it is the best
means to achieve the desired result, whether, in short, the
legislative discretion within its prescribed limits should be
exercised in a particular manner, are matters for the judgment of the legislature, and the earnest conflict of serious
opinion does not suffice to bring them within the range of
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
judicial cognizance."
RailroadCo. v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549, 569.
The restiictions upon the legislative power which complainant urges we have discussed, or rather the considerations which take, it is contended, the business of insurance
outside of the sphere of the power. To the contention that
the business is private we have opposed the conception of
the public interest. We have shown that the business of
insurance has very definite characteristics, with a reach
of influence and consequence beyond and different from
that of the ordinary businesses of the commercial world, to
pursue which a greater liberty may be asserted. The
transactions of the latter axe independent and individual,
terminating in their effect with the instances. The contracts of insurance may be said to be interdependent.
They cannot be regarded singly, or isolatedly, and the
effect of their relation is to create a fund of assurance and
credit, the companies becoming the depositories of the
money of the insured, possessing great power thereby and
charged. with great responsibility. How necessary their
solvency is, is manifest. On the other hand to the insured, insurance is an asset, a basis of credit. It is practically a necessity to business activity and enterprise.
It is, therefore, essentially different from ordinary com-

GERMAN ALLIANCE; INS. CO. v. KANSAS.

415

Opinion of the Court.

mercial transactions, and, &3we have seen, according to
the sense of the world from the earliest times-certainly
the sense of the modern world-is of the greatest public
concern. It is, therefore, within the principle we have
announced.
But it is said that the reasoning of the opinion has the
broad reach of subjecting to regulation every act of human
endeavor and the price of every article of human use.
We might, without much concern, leave our discussion to
take care of itself against such misunderstanding or
deductions. The principle we apply is definite and old
and has, as we have pointed out, illustrating examples.
And both by the expression of the principle and the citation of the examples we have tried to confine our decision
to the regulation of the business of insurance, it having
become "clothed with a public interest," and therefore
subject "to be controlled by the public for the common
good."
If there may be controversy as to the business having
such character, there can be no controversy as to what
follows from such character if it be established. It is idle,
therefore, to debate whether the liberty of contract
guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States is
more intimately involved in price regulation than in the
other forms of regulation as to the validity of which there
is no dispute. The order of their enactment certainly
cannot be considered an element in their legality. It
would be very rudimentary to say that measures of government are determined by circumstances, by the presence
or imminence of conditions, and of the legislative judgment of the means or the policy of removing or preventing
them. The power to regulate interstate commerce existed
for a century before the Interstate Commerce Act was
passed, and the Commission constituted by it was not
given authority to fix rates until some years afterwards.
Of the agencies which those measures were enacted to

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

233 U. S.

regulate at the time of the creation of the power, there was
no prophecy or conception. Nor was regulation immediate
.upon their existence. It was exerted only when the size,
number and influence of those agencies had so increased
and developed as to seem to make it imperative. Other
illustrations readily occur which repel the intimation that
the inactivity of a power, however prolonged, militates
against its legality when it is exercised. United States v.
Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366. It is oftener the
existence of necessity rather than the prescience of it
which dictates legislation. And so with the regulations
of the business of insurance. They have proceeded step
by step, differing in different jurisdictions. If we are
brought to a comparison of them in relation to the power
of government, how can it be said that fixing the price of
insurance is beyond that power and the other instances of
regulation are not? How can it be said that the right to
engage in the business is a natural one when it can be
denied to individuals and permitted to corporations?
How can it be said -to have the privilege of a private
business when its dividends are restricted, its investments
controlled, the form and extent of its contracts prescribed,
discriminations in its rates denied and a limitation on
its risks imposed? Are not such regulations restraints
upon the exercise of the personal right-asserted to be
fundamental-of dealing with property freely or engaging
in what contracts one may choose and with whom and
upon what terms one may choose?
We may venture to observe that the price of insurance
is not fixed over the counters of the companies by what
Adam Smith calls the higgling of the market, but formed
in the councils of the underwriters, promulgated in schedules of practically controlling constancy which the applicant for insurance is powerless to oppose and which,
therefore, has led to the assertion that the business of insurance is of monopolistic character and that "it is illusory

Opinion of the Court.

to speak of a liberty of contract." It is in the alternative
presented of accepting the rates of the companies or refraining from insurance, business necessity impelling if not
compelling it, that we may discover the inducement of the
Kansas statute, and the problem presented is whether the
legislature could regard it of as much moment to the public
that they who seek insurance should no more be constrained
by arbitrary terms than they who seek transportation by
railroads, steam or street, or by coaches whose itinerary
may be only a few city blocks, or who seek the use of grain
elevators, or be secured in a night's accommodation at a
wayside inn, or in the weight of a five-cent loaf of bread.
We do not say this to belittle such rights or to exaggerate
the effect of insurance, but to exhibit the principle which
exists in all and brings all under the same governmental
power.
We have summarized the provisions of the Kansas
statute, and it will be observed from them that they attempt to systematize the control of insurance. The statute seeks to secure rates which shall be reasonable both
to the insurer and the insured, and as a means to this end
it prescribes equality of charges,, forbids initial discrimination or subsequently by the refund of a portion of the
rates, or the extension to the insured of any privilege;
to this end it requires publicity in the basic schedules and
of all of the conditions which affect the rates or the value
of the insurance to the insured, and also adherence to-the
rates as published. Whether the requirements are necessary to the purpose, or-to confine ourselves to that which
is under review-whether rate regulation is necessary to
the purpose, is a matter for legislative judgment, not
judicial.. Our function is only to determine the existence
of power.
The bill attacks the statute of Kansas as discriminating
against complainant because the statute excludes from its
provisions farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized

and doing business under the laws of the State and insuring only farm property. The charge is not discussed
in the elaborate brief of counsel, nor does it seem to have
been pressed in the lower court. It is, however, covered
by the assignments of error.
The provision of the statute is, "That nothing in this act,
shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies organized and doing business under the laws of this State and
insuring only farm property." The distinction is, therefore, between cooperative insurance companies insuring
a special kind of property and all other insurance companies. It is only with that distinction that we are now
concerned. There are special provisions in the statutes
of Kansas for the organization of co5perative companies
and if the statute under review discriminates between them
the German Alliance Company cannot avail itself of the
discrimination. A citation of cases is not necessary,
nor for the general principle that a discrimination is valid
if not arbitrary, and arbitrary in the legislative sense, that
is, outside of that wide discretion which a legislature may
exercise. A legislative classification may rest on narrow
distinctions. Legislation is addressed to evils as they
may appear, and even degrees of evil may determine
its exercise. Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Bank, 207
U. S. 251. There are certainly differences between stock
companies, such as complainant is, and the mutual companies described in the bill, and a recognition of the differences we cannot say is outside of the constitutional
power of the legislature. Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, 172

ing the safety or morals of the public. It presents no
question of monopoly in a prime necessity of life, but
relates solely to the powver of the State to fix the price
of a strictly personal contract. The court holds that fire
insurance though personal is affected with a public interest and therefore, that the business may not only be
regulated but that the premium or price to be paid to the
insurer for entering into that personal contract can be
fixed by law.
The fixing of the price for the use of private property is
as much a taking as though the fee itself had been condemned for a lump sum-that taking, whether by fixing
rates for the use or by paying a lump sum for the fee, has
always heretofore been thought to be permissible only
when it was for a public use. But the court in this case
holds that there is no distinction between the power to
take for public use and the power to regulate the exercise
of private rights for the public good. That is the fundamental proposition on which the case must stand, and the
decision must therefore be considered in the light of that
ruling and of the results which must necessarily flow from
the future application of that principle. For-if the power
to regulate, in the interest of the public, comprehends
what is intended in the power to take property for public
use, it must inevitably follow that the price to be paid
for any service or the use of any property can be reg 'ated
by the General Assembly. This is so because the pwer
of regulation is all-pervading, as witness the statu of
frauds, the recording acts, weight and measure laws, pure
food laws, hours of service laws, and innumerable other
enactments of that class. And if thig power be as extensive
as is now, for the first time, decided, then the citizen
holds his property and his individual right of contract
and of labor under legislative favor rather than under
constitutional guaranty. The principle is applied here
to the case of insurance; but the nature of that business

and the intangible character of its contracts are such as to
indicate the far-reaching effect of the principle announced,
and warrants a statement of some of the grounds of dissent.
Insurance' is not production; nor manufacture; nor
transportation; nor merchandise. And this court in
N. Y. Life Co. v. Deer Lodge Co., 231 U. S. 495, at the
present term, reaffirmed its previous rulings that "insurance is not commerce," "not an instrumentality of
commerce," "not a transaction of commerce," "but
simply contracts of indemnity against loss by fire." Such
a contract is personal and in the State whose statute is
under consideration, insurance companies are classed
among those "strictly private." Leavenworth County v.
Miller, 7 Kansas, 479, 520. The fact, that insurance is
a strictly private and a personal contract of indemnity
puts it on the extreme outside limit and removes it as far
as any business can be from those that are in their nature
public. So that if the price of a private and personal contract of indemnity can be regulated,-if the price of a
chose in action can be fixed,-then the price of everything
within the circle of business transactions can be regulated.
Considering, therefore, the nature of the subject treated
and the reasoning on which the court's opinion is based,
it is evident that the decision is not a mere entering
wedge, but reaches the end from the beginning and announces a principle which points inevitably to the conclusion that the price of every article sold and the price
of every service offered can be regulated by statute.
And such laws are not without English precedent. For
while no statute ever before attempted to fix the price
of a contract of indemnity, I yet under a Parliament that
sat as a perpetual constitutional convention, with power
statute fixing the premium rates on surety bonds was held
to be void in Am. Surety Co. v. Shallenberger, 183 Fed. Rep. 636.

to pass bills of attainder, to take property for private purposes and to take it without due process of law, many
statutes approaching that now under review were adopted
and enforced. Acts were passed by Parliament fixing
the price of many commodities that were convenient or
useful. These laws did not stop at fixing the price of
property, but, like the present act they fixed the price of
private contracts, and, by statute prescribed the rate
of wages, and made it unlawful for the employ6 to receive
or for the employer to give more than the wage fixed by,
law. It is needless to say that these laws were felt to be
an infringement upon the rights of men; that they were
bitterly resisted by buyer and seller, by employer and employ6, and were a source of peipetual irritation often leading to violence. But the fact that the English Parliament
had the arbitrary power to pass such statutes made them
valid in law, though they were in violation of the inherent
rights of individual. In time, the great injustice in this,
was so far recognized that thEcse laws, fixing the price of
strictly private contracts, seem to have been repealed,
and Lord Ellenborough, while enforcing, as proper, a rate
for public wharfs, was able to say, in Allnutt v. Inglis, 12
East, 527, 538, "that the general principle is favored both
in law and justice, that every man may fix what price
he pleases for his own property or the use of it." But what
was a favor in England, that might at any time be withdrawn, was in this country made a constitutional right
that could not be withdrawn. For although the practice
of fixing prices may have prevailed in some of the Colonies
"up to the time of independence," yet, as Judge Cooley
says, since independence "it ha.s3 been commonly supposed
that a general power in the State to regulate prices was
inconsistent with constitutional liberty." Cooley's Const.
Law (7th ed.) 807; Stickney's State Control of Trade, p. 3
and the abstract of English price-fixing statutes, p. 9 et seq.
That common supposition is rightly founded on the fact

233 U. S.

that the Constitution recognizes the liberty to contract and
right of private property. They include not only the
right to make contracts with which to acquire property,
but the right to fix the price of its use while it is held, and
the further right to fix the price if it is to be sold. To deprive any person of either is to take property, since there
can be no liberty of contract and true private ownership
if the price of its use or its sale is fixed by law. That right
is an attribute of ownership. State Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232,
278, top.
But it may be said that, though insurance is a contract
of indemnity and personal, its personal character has not
been thought to preclude the many regulatory measures
adopted and sustained during the past hundred years.
This is most freely conceded. But it is equally true
that the failure for more than 100 years to attempt to
fix the rates of insurance is indubitable evidence of the
general public and legislative conception that the business
of insurance did not belong to the class whose rates could
be fixed. That settled usage is not an accident. For ratemaking is no new thing, and neither is insurance. Its use
in protecting the owner of property against loss; its value
as collateral in securing loans; its method of averages and
distributing the risk between many persons widely separated and all contributing small premiums in return for
the promise of a large indemnity, has been known for
centuries. All these considerations were recently pressed
upon the court in an effort to secure a ruling that insurance
was commerce. In refusing to accede to the sufficiency
of the argument, the court in the Deer Lodge Case pointed
out that the size of the business of insurance did not change
the inherent nature of the business itself, saying that "the
number of transactions do not give the business any other
character than magnitude."
The character of insurance, therefore, as a private and
personal contract of indemnity, has not been changed by

LAMAIR,

its magnitude or by the fact that more policies and for
greater amounts are now written than in the centuries
during which no effort has ever before been made to fix
their rates. It is, however, undoubtedly true that during
all of that period regulatorystatutes were, from time to time,
adopted to protect the public against conditions and practices which were subject to regulation. The public had
no means of knowing whether these corporations were
solvent or not, and statutes were passed to require a publication of the financial condition. The policies were long
and complicated, with exceptions, and qualifications, and
provisos. They were often unread by the policyholder
and sometimes not understood when read. Statutes were
accordingly passed providing for a standard form of policy
in order to protect the assured against his inexperience, to
prevent hard bargains, and to avoid vexatious litigation,
and as similar evils appear they may be dealt with by
regulatory or prohibitory legislation just as statutes were
passed and can still be passed to punish combinations,
pooling arrangements, and all those practices which
amount to unfair competition.
But these and those referred to in Attorney General v.
Firemen'sInsurance Co., 74 N. J. Eq. 372, furnish instances
of the exercise of this power to regulate which can be exerted against any person, trade or business, no matter how
great or small. This power to regulate is so much oftener
exerted against the large business, because the evils are
then more apparent, that the size of the business and the
number of persons interested is sometimes referred to as
indicating that the business is affected with a public interest. But there is no such limitation. For the power to
regulate is the essential power of government which can
be exerted against the whole body of the public or the
smallest business. And if, as seems to be implied, the
fact that a business may be regulated is to be the test
of the power to fix rates, it would follow, since all can be

regulated, the price charged by all can be regulated. Or
if great size is the test, if the number of customers is the
test, if the scope of the business throughout the nation is
the test, if the contributions of the many to the value of
the business is the test-or if it takes a combination of all
to meet the condition,-then every business with great
capital and many customers distributed throughout the
country and making a large business possible, must be
treated as affected with a public interest, and the price of
the goods on its shelves can be fixed by law. Then could
the price of newspapers, magazines and the like be fixed,
because certainty nothing is more affected with a public
interest, nothing is so dependent on the public, nothing
reaches so many persons and so profoundly affects public
thought and public business, Such a business is, indeed,
affected with a public interest,-justifying regulation
(Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, 229 U. 8. 288), but not
the fixing of the price of the paper or periodical or the
rates of advertising. For great and pervasive as is the
power to regulate, it cannot override the constitutional
principle that private property cannot be taken for private
purposes. Missouri Pacific v. Nebraska, 164 U. S. 403.
That limitation on the power of government over the
individual and his property cannot be avoided by calling
an unlawful taking a reasonable regulation. Indeed, the
protection of property is an incident of the more fundamental and important right of liberty guaranteed by the
Constitution and which entitled the. citizen freely to en-.
gage in any honest calling and to make .contracts as buyer
or seller, as employer or employ6, in order to support himself and family.
It is said, however, that the validity of rate statutes has
often been recognized, notably in the Munn Case (94 U. S.
113, 126) where a statute was sustained which regulated
the price to be charged for storing grain in elevators.
The Munn Case is a landmark in the law. It is accepted

GERMAN ALLIANCE INS. CO. v. KANSAS.
233 U. S.

LAMAR,

J., dissenting.

as an authoritative and accurate statement of the principle
on which the right to fix rates is based. But the statute
there under review did not undertake to fix the price of a
personal contract, but to fix the price for the use of property, once private, but then public. The reasoning of the
court clearly shows that in order to regulate rates, two
things must concur-(1) the business must be affected
with a public interest; and (2) the property employed in
such business must be devoted to a public use. The basic
principle of the decision was the oft quoted saying of Lord
Hale that "when private property is affected with a public
interest, it ceases to be juris privati only." The decision
in the Munn Case was but an application of that terse
statement and was applied in a case where the elevators
had been devoted to a public use. This will distinctly
appear from the statement by the court of the question
involved and decided. For after reviewing and applying
Lord Hale's pithy saying and reviewing the other authorities the court said (italics ours):
"Enough has already been said to show that, when
private property is devoted to a public use, it is subject to
public regulation. It remains only to ascertain whether
the warehouses of these plaintiffs in error, and the business
which is carried on there, come within the operation of
'this principle" (p. 130).
Not only does the Munn Case show that the right to fix
prices depends on the concurrence of public interest and
the employment of property devoted to a public use, but
with the exception of the Louisiana Bread Case, 12 La.
Ann. 432, it is believed that every American rate-statute
since the requirement that property should not be taken
without due process of law, related to a business which
was public in its character and employed visible and
tangible property which had been devoted to a public use.
The list of rate-regulated occupations is not too long
to be here given. It includes canals, waterways and

booms; bridges and ferries; wharves, docks, elevators and
stockyards; telegraph, telephone, electric, gas and oil lines;
turnpikes, railroads and the various forms of common carriers, including express and cabs. To this should be added
the. case of the inn-keeper (as to which no American case
has been found where the constitutional question as to
the right to fix his rates has been considered), the confessedly close case of the irrigation ditches for distributing
water (189 U. S. 439), and the toll mill acts. This of
course does not include the case of condemnation for governmental purposes or for roads and ways where no question of rates is involved. There may be other instances
not found, but it is believed that the foregoing numeration
exhausts the list of what has heretofore been treated as a
public business justifying the exercise of the price-fixing
power against persons or corporations.
It is to be noted that in each instance the power to regulate rates is exercised against a business which in every
case used tangible property devoted to a public use.
Some of them had a monopoly (Spring Water Co. v.
Schottler, 110 U. S.347, 354). Some of them had franchises. Most of them used public ways or employed property which they had acquired by virtue -of the power of
eminent domain. They were therefore subject to'the
correlative obligation to have the use, of what had been
thus taken by law, fixed by law. And as further pointing
out the characteristics of the public use justifying the fixing
of prices, it will be noted that, with the exception of toll
mills (which, however, do employ, property devoted to a
public use), they all have direct relation to the business or
facilities of transportation or distribution-to transportation by carriers of passengers, goods or intelligence by
vehicle or wire ;--to distribution of water, gas or electricity
through ditch, pipe or wire; to wharfage, storage or accommodation of property before the journey begins, when
it ends, or along the way.

When thus enumerated, they appear to be grouped
around the common carrier as the typical public business
and all employing in some way property devoted to a
public use.
It will be seen, too, that the size of the business is unimportant, for the fares of a cabman, employing a brokendown horse and a dilapidated vehicle, can be fixed by law
as well as the rates of a railroad with millions of capital
and thousands of cars transporting persons and -property
across the continent.
The fact that rate-statutes, enacted and sustained since
the adoption of constitutional government in this country, all had some reference to transportation or distribution, is a practical illustration of the accepted meaning of
"public use" when that phrase was first employed in
American constitutions, and when turnpikes and carriers,
wharfingers and ferrymen had rates, tolls and fares fixed
by law. No change was made in the meaning of the words
or in the principle involved when it opened to take in new
forms and facilities of transportation, whether by vehicle,
pipe or wire, and new forms of storage, whether on the
wharf or in the grain-elevator.
But it is said that business is the fundamental thing
and the property but an instrument, and that there is
no basis for the distinction between a public interest and
a public use. But there is a distinction between a public
interest-justifying regulat'on-and a public use-justifying price fixing. "Public interest and public use are not
synonymous." In re Niagara Falls Ry. Co., 138 N. Y.
375, 385. And since the case here involves the validity of
a Kansas statute it is well to note that the Supreme Court
of that State in Howard v. Schwartz, 77 Kansas, 599, recognizes that there is a difference and adjudges accordingly.
It there cited numerous decisions from other States and
in defining a public use, made the following quotation
from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Maine:

,OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
LAmAR,

J., dissenting.

233 U. S.

"'Property is devoted to a public use when, and only
all the public has a right to demand and
when, . .
share in"' it " . .
In a broad sense it is the right
in the public to an actual use, and not to an incidental
benefit." (p. 609).
The effect of the difference between public use and
public interest appears from the application; for'the Supreme Court of Kansas on the authority of this and'
numerous other cases, held that a steam flour mill was
not such a public use as would authorize its owners to exercise the power of eminent domain, though it was "a
useful and imporiant business instrumentality which contributed to the growth and development of the locality
where the (millsi are situated. This may also be said, however, of every legitimate business. -To a limited extent
every honest industry adds to the general sum of prosperity and promotes the public welfare" (p. 609).
Nothing more can be said of insurance-nor can the
power to take the private property of insurers, by fixing
rates, be enlarged by a legislative declaration that the
business is affected with a broad and definite public interest. For since the contract of insurance is private and
personal, it is almost a contradiction in. terms to say that
the private contract is public or that a business which consists in making such private contracts is public in the constitutional sense. The fundamental idea of a public
business, as well declared by the Supreme Court of Kansas,
77 Kansas, 608, is that "all the public has a right to demand and share in" it. That means that each member
of the public on demand and upon equal terms, without
written contract, without haggling as to terms, may demand the public service, and secure the use of the facility
devoted to public use. If the company can make distinctions and serve one and refuse to serve another, the business ex vi termini is not public. The common carrier has
no right to refuse to haul a passenger even if he has been

convicted of arson. But if an insurance company is indeed
public it is bound to insure the property of the man who
is suspected of having set fire to his own house, or whose
statements of value it is unwilling to take. This is manifestly inconsistent with the contract of insurance which
requires the utmost good faith, not only in making truthful
answers to questions asked, but in not concealing anything material to the risk. If the company has the discretion to insure or the right to refuse--to insure, .then, by
the very definition of the terms, it is not a public business.
If, on the 'other hand, the company is obliged to insure
bad risks or the property of men of bad character, of
doubtful veracity or known to be careless in their handling
of property the law would be an arbitrary exertion of power
in compelling men to enter into contract with persons with
whom they did not choose to deal where confidence is the
very foundation of a contract of indemnity. Indeed, it
seems to be conceded that a person owning property is not
entitled to demand insurance as a matter of right. If not,
the business is not public and not within the provision of
the Constitution which only authorizes the taking of property for public purposes--whether the taking be of the
'fee for a lump sum assessed in condemnation proceedings,
or whether the use be taken by rate-regulation, which is
but another method of exercising the same power.
The suggestion that the public interest is found in the
characteristics of the business of insurance, justifies a
brief examination of those characteristics and a statement
of the results that logically must follow from such a test.
For if the power is to develop out of the characteristics, it
must necessarily follow that other occupations, having
similar characteristics, must be subject to the same rateregulating power.
The elements which are said to show that insurance is
affected with a public interest do not arise out of the size
of any one company, but out of the volume of the aggre-

gate business of all the companies doing business within
the State and beyond its borders. If that test be applied,
and if the sum of the units is to determine whether or not
a business is affected with a public interest (which is said
to be the equivalent of a public use), then if the principle
of the decision be applied to the business of farming all
can see to what end it leads. In view of the amount of
property employed and the aggregate number of persons
engaged in agriculture and the public's absolute dependence upon that pursuit, it would follow that, farming being
affected with a broad and definite public interest, the price
of wheat and corn; cotton and wools; beef, pork, mutton
and poultry; fruit and vegetables, could be fixed. Or if
we take the aggregate of those who labor and consider
the public's absolute dependence upon labor, it would
inevitably follow that it, too, was affected with a broad
and definite public interest and that wages in the United
States of America in this Twentieth Century could be fixed
by law, just as in England between the 14th and 18th centuries. And. inasmuch as the prices of agricultural products are dependent on the price of land and labor, and as
the price of labor is closely related to the cost of rent and
food and clothes and the comforts of life, there would be
the power to take the further step and regulate the cost
of everything which enters into the cost of living. Of
course, it goes without saying that if the rates for fire insurance can be fixed, then the rates for life and marine
insurance can be fixed. By a parity of reasoning the rates
of accident, guaranty and fidelity insurance could also be
regulated. There seems no escape from the conclusion
that the asserted power to fix the price to be paid by one
private ,person to another private person or private corporation for a private contract of indemnity, or for his
product, or his labor, or for his private contracts of any
sort, will become the center of a circle of price-making
legislation that, in its application, will destroy the right of

private property and break down the barriers which the
Constitution has thrown around the citizen to protect
him in his right of property--which includes his right of
contract to make property, his right to fix the price at
which his property shall be used by another. By virtue
of the liberty which is guaranteed by the Constitution, he
also has the right to name the wage for his labor and to fix
the terms of contracts of irLdemnity,-whether they be
contracts of endorsement or suretyship, or contracts of
indemnity against loss by fire, flood, or accident.
In view of what Judge Cooley calls the general supposition that "the right to fix prices was inconsistent with
constitutional liberty," it is not surprising that little is
to be found in the books relating to a statute like this. It
is, however, somewhat curious that among the few expressions to be found on the subject, is the intimation by Lord
Ellenborough in Allnutt v. inglis, 12 East, 527, 535, that
insurance rates were not on the same basis as a public
business using property devoted to a public use. For in
answering the argument that if the rates of a public wharf
could be fixed, insurance rates could also be fixed, he
clearly intimates that this could not be done, since the
wharf was a monopoly and "the business of insurance and
of counting-houses may be carried on elsewhere."
In the following cases the statutes fixing prices have
been held to be void. Ex parteDickey, 144 California, 234,
fixing the price to be charged by an employment bureau;
Ex parte Quarg, 149 California, 79; People v. Steele, 231
Illinois, 340, prohibiting the sale of theater tickets at a
price higher than that charged by the theater; State. v.
Fire Creek Coke Co., 33 West Va. 188, limiting the profits
on sales to employ~s. See also State v. McCool, 83 Kansas,
428, 430, bot., where in sustaining a statute regulating the
weight of bread the court called attention to the fact that
the statute did not attempt to fix the price. To these could
be added a multitude of decisions showing that the power

to regulate is limited by the constitutional prohibition
against the taking of private property. Guillotte v. New
Orleans, 12 La. Ann. 432, is the only American case found
which sustains the right to fix prices for other than a

commodity or service furnished by a public utility company of the kind already pointed out. In that case the
court said that the city could fix the price of bread and
that if the baker did not desire to do business within the
limits of such city he could go elsewhere. That reasoning
would support any statute, for every citizen at least has
the right to go out of business. But it has been repeatedly
held by this court that such an anpwer cannot sustain an
invalid statute, the Constitution being intended to secure
the citizen against being driven out of business by an unconstitutional statute or regulation.
There is, in the opinion an allusion to usury laws as
instances of fixing rates for other than public service corporations. We do not understand that the opinion is
founded on that proposition, for even the usury laws do
not fix a flat rate, but only a maximum rate, and do not
require lenders to make loans to all borrowers, similarly
situated, at the same rate of interest. Moreover interest
laws were in their inception not a restriction upon the
right of contract but an enlargement, permitting what
theretofore had been regarded both as an ecclesiastical
and civil offense. This fact may have been coupled with
the idea that as the sovereign had the prerogative to coin
money and make legal tender for all claims, he could fix
the price that should be charged for the use of that
money.
At any rate, interest laws had been long recognized
before the Constitution and have been prevalent ever
since. They, therefore, fall within the rule that contemporary practice, if subsequently continued and universally
acquiesced in, amounts to an interpretation of the Constitution. But the same character of long continued ac-

quiescence and settled usage that sustains a usury law
also sustains the right ol the contracting parties to agree
upon the charge for insurance. For centuries before the
Constitution, and continuously ever since they have themselves fixed this charge, and this makes most strongly
in favor of their right to continue to agree upon the
price of a private contract of indemnity against loss by
fire.
The act now under review not only takes property without due process of law but it unequally and arbitrarily
selects those from which such property shall be taken by
price fixing. Although including all other fire insurance
companies, it excepts certain mutual insurance companies.
Persons engaged in doing an insurance business are not
within its terms. In Kansas, the right to do a fire insurance business is not limited to corporations, but may be
conducted by persons, individuals, partners, companies
and associations, whether incorporated or not. General
Statutes of Kansas (1909), §§ 4086, 4091, 4122. And if it
could be true that the legislature could fix the price of
insurance it would seem to be doubly necessary that all
doing an insurance business should be treated alike. There
is no difference in principle and none by statute in the
character of the contract, whether it is made by one man,
or the Lloyds, or a corporation. There is no difference in
the character of the contract made by a stock company
and a mutual company. In each instance the contract is
one of indemnity against loss for a fixed premium. If the
policy-holder is a stockholder in an ordinary corporation,
he may get back some of his premium by way of dividen4s;
if he is a member of a mutual company, he pays his premium and gets back his share of the earnings. But to say
that the State may fix the price to be charged for insurance
by a stock company and that it will not fix the price to be
charged by mutual companies or by the Lloyds, who do an
enormous business of exactly the same nature on exactly

ERROR TO THE SURROGATES' COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY,
STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 45.

Argued November 5, 6, 1913.-Decided April 20, 1914.

The provision in the New York Inheritance Tax Statute, imposing a
transfer tax on property within the State belonging to a non-resident
at the time of his death, is not unconstitutional under the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to promissory notes
the makers of which are non-residents of that State. Buck v. Beach,

promissory notes located in the, State although neither the

Mr. Charles P. Howland for plaintiffs in error:
The taxation of the full value of the debts represented
by these promissory notes deprived the executors and
beneficiaries of the estate of their property without due
process of law, and was in contravention of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
