METZGER MOTOR CAR COMPANY v. PARROTT.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
No. 309. Argued March 18, 19, 1914.-Decided April 6, 1914.
Where, since the judgment of the United States District Court was obtained the highest court of the State has declared the state statute
on which the case was brought to be unconstitutional under the state
constitution, and there is no right to recover inthe absence of statute,
it is the obvious duty of this court to reverse the judgment.
While this court must decide for itself whether a state statute is repug-.
nant to the Federal Constitution, it must accept the ruling of the state
court as to the repugnancy of that statute to the state constitution.
This court cannot treat as existing a state statute which the court of
last resort of that State has held cannot be enforced compatibly with
the state constitution.
The highest court of Michigan having, since the judgment herein was
rendered below held the provisions of the Vehicle Law of that State
on which this action was based void under the state constitution,
this court must regard such law as non-existent and reverse the judgment which was based solely thereon.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Henry L. Lyster, With whom Mr. John C. Donnelly
was on the brief, for plaintiff in er'ror:
Subd. 3 of ยง10 of Act No. 318 of the Public Acts of 1909
of Michigan has been held to be in contravention of the
Fourteenth Amendment by the court of last resort in
Michigan; therefore the case at bar must be, considered
as though this act had never been passed by the legislature. Barry v. Metzger Motor Car Co., 141 N. W, Rep.

The act having been held invalid, defendant in error
has no statutory right of action; and the servant of plaintiff in error, who was operating the car having acted outside the scope of his authority, defendant in error has.no
common law right of action.
Mr. Silas B. Spier for defendant in error:
As to the extent to which plaintiff in error, a New York
corporation, can claim the protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment in this court, to invalidate the judgment
rendered against it in the court below, see Selover, Bates
& Co. v. Walsh, 226 U. S. 113; Western Turf Assn. v.
Greenberg, 204 U. S. 359, both of which refute its contentions.
Notwithstanding the second and reversing decision of
the Michigan court in Daugherty v. Thomas, 174 Michigan, 371, the Michigan Motor Vehicle Law, in its entirety,
is constitutioni1.
The law is not unreasonable. It merely tries to protect
human life, and for that purpose requires that the owner
of an automobile must so care for and keep it, that it cannot be used by any person on the public highway in violation of the law, and if so used the owner must respond by
payment of the actual damages done by his machine when
thus illegally used, except said automobile be stolen.
The effect of this police regulation has been beneficial
and has saved lives and prevented injury to personal
property. Owners of automobiles have protected themselves by insurance. See Cooley's Const. Lim., pp. 164,
572; People v. Schneider, 139 Michigan, 673; Mattei v.

The owner of personal property can be made liable for
damages dorie by it without his negligence. Shipley v.
Colclough, 81 Michigan, 624; People v. Eberle, 133 N. W.
Rep. 519.
The law is a valid police regulation and constitutional
in all respects except the provision making the automobile's owner responsible for damages done by it. The
act only makes the owner responsible when his automobile,
his personal property, is used illegally on the public
streets or highways. He csn prevent its illegal use and
for the benefit of human life and the safety of property
should be willing so to do.
As to the power of the legislature to enact laws under the
exercise of the police power vested therein, see Chicago v.

The provisions of the first section of the Fourteenth
Amendment do not guarantee to the individual citizen
the unqualified right to do a;s he chooses with his property,
regardless of the rights of others; but such rights are subject to such reasonable restraint, under the police power
of the State, as. the law-making power may prescribe for
the benefit of all the people. Crowley v. Christensen, 137

Memorandum opinion by direction of the court, by
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.

This action, brought in the state court to recover for
personal injuries and other damages, was removed by the
defendant to the Circuit Court of the United States on
the ground of diverse citizenship, and there tried, resulting
:n a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. Direct error
is prosecuted to that court (now the District Court) because of the asserted repugnancy of the following statute
of the State upon which the recovery was based, to the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:
"The owner of a motor vehicle shall be liable for any
injury occasioned by the negligent operation by any-person
of such motor vehicle, whether such negligence consists
in violations of the provisions of a statute of this State or
in the failure to observe such ordinary care in such operation as the rules of the common law require; but such
owner shall not be so liable in case such motor vehicle
shall have been stolen." (Act No. 318, Pub. Acts 1909,
subd. 3, ยง 10.)
The injuries complained of, were caused by the negli-

Opinion of the Court.

gence of a chauffeur in operating an automobile owned by
the defendant company, resulting in a collision on the
highway with plaintiff's horses and the cart in which he
with two others were riding. Although the driver of the
company
automobile was in the employ of the defendant
as a car tester and chauffeur, he was not at the time of
the accident (about midnight) engaged in the company's
business, but had taken the car without the knowledge or
consent of the company and in violation of its rules for
the purpose of pleasure-riding with his friends. Under
these facts, aside from the statute, the court below charged
the jury, and it is not here disputed, that the plaintiff
could not recover under the law of Michigan for the injuries suffered, and hence 'that his right to recover, if any,
was exclusively under the statute.
The duty of considering the contention here urged, the
unconstitutionality of the statute, is rendered unnecessary
by decisions of the Supreme Court of the State since the
trial of this case in which the statute was held void because
in conflict with both the state and the United States
constitutions. Daughtery v. Thomas, 174 Michigan, 371;
Barry v. Metzger Motor Car Company, 175 Michigan, 466.
We say this because while it is undoubtedly our duty to
decide for ourselves whether the statute is repugnant to
the Constitution of the United States, we must accept
the ruling of the state court as to the repugnancy of the
statute to the state constitution. As the effect of the state
decision on that subject is to determine that ab initio
the statute was void, and as there was admittedly no
right to recover in the absence of a valid statute, the obvious duty to reverse results.
There is a suggestion in the argument that prior to the
decisions of the state court to which we have referred
which expressly held the statute to be unconstitutional
there had been a ruling of that court deciding it not to be
repugnant to the state constitution. Johnson v. Sergeant,

Syllabus.

233 U. S.

134 N. W. Rep. 468. But it is to be observed that as to
that ruling the court in the Daugherty Case declared that
the statement as to the constitutionality of the statute
made in the JohnsonCase was merely obiter. Even however,
if this were not the case, we cannot now treat as existing, a
statute which the court ,of last resort of the State declares
cannot be enforced compatibly with the state constitution.
And as here there is no claim of rights acquired under contract in the light of a settled rule of state interpretation of
a state law or constitution, there is no foundation whatever for upholding assumed rights which can alone rest
upon the existence of a state statute when the state court
of last resort has held there is no valid statute to sustain
them.

GRAND TRUNK WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY
v. LINDSAY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 425.

Argued February 27, 1914.-Decided April 6, 1914.

The operation and effect of the Employers' Liability Act upon the
rights of the parties is involved in an action for negligence where the
complaint alleges and the proof establishes that the employ6 was
engaged in, and the injury occurred in the course of, interstate commerce even though the act was not referred to in the pleadings or
pressed at the trial. Seaboard Air Line v. DuvaU, 225 U. S. 477.
Although ยง 3 of the Employers' Liability Act establishes a system of
comparative negligence, and diminution of damages by reason of the
employ6's contributory negligence, the proviso to that section expressly provides that contributory negligence does not operate to
diminish the recovery if the injury has been occasioned in part by
the failure of the carrier to comply with Safety Appliance Acts.
