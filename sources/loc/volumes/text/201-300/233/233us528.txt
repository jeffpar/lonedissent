v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 177.

Submitted April 17, 1914.-Decided May 4, 1914.

The guardianship of the United States over allottee Indians does not
cease upon the making of the allotment and the allottee becoming a
citizen of the United States. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221
U. S. 286.
The United States has capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside
conveyances of lands allotted to Indians under its cafe where restrictions upon alienation have been transgressed. Heckman v.
United States, 224 U. S. 413.
A transfer of allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress is a
violation of governmental rights of the United States arising from
its obligation to a dependent people, and no stipulations, contracts
or judgments in suits to which the United States is a stranger can
affect its interest.
The authority of the United States to enforce a restraint lawfully
created by it cannot be impaired by any action without its consent.
Restrictions on alienation imposed by acts of Congress imposed by the
act of March 2, 1889, regarding the allotments to the confederated
,tribes specified therein, are not mere personal restrictions operative
upon the allottee alone, but run with the land and are binding upon
his heirs as well for the specified term.
The intent of Congress in regard to its enactments-such as those relating to restrictions on alienation of Indian allotted lands-may be
indicated by subsequent enactments relating to the same subjectmatter.
191 Fed. Rep. 19, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of statutes
affecting the alienation of Indian allotments, are stated in
the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W.
Williams for the United States:
Without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior
the heirs were powerless to sell the allotment.
The act of March 2, 1889, plainly declares, not that the
allottee may not alienate, but that the land itself shall
not be subject to alienation for a period of 25 years from
the date of patent. In the absence of. any clear and con-'
trolling reason to the contrary, the act should be applied
according to this obvious meaning of its language.
Neither in the antecedents of the act nor in any consideration of necessity or convenience respecting its policy,
can an excuse be discovered for departing from its ,letter.
On the contrary, to imply an exception in favor of the

BOWLING v. UNITED STATES.
233 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

alienation of inherited lands would be productive of hardship and injustic'e and tend to defeat the protective purposes of the act and the objects of the reservation.
The acts of May 31, 1900, and May 27, 1902, which
provide, the former with reference to this reservation
specifically and the latter generally, that restricted allotments when inherited may be: sold by the heirs subject to
the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, remove all
doubt, if any there can be, concerning the intention of the
act of March 2, 1889.
The decree of the United States court for the Indian
Territory is null and-void.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
Pursuant to the act of March 2, 1889, c. 422, 25 Stat.
1013, a tract of land in the Indian Territory was'allotted
to Pe-te-lon-o-zah, or William Wea, a member of the
confederated Wea, Peoria, Kaskaskia and Piankeshaw
tribes of Indians. The patent, conveying the land to
Wea and his heirs, was issued on April 8, 1890, and imposed a restraint upon alienation for a period of twentyfive years from its date. Upon the death of Wea, his
heirs entered into a contract to sell the land and in a suit
brought by them in the United States court for the
Northern District of the Indian Territory, for the purpose
of enforcing the contract, judgment was entered sustaining its validity. The property was thereupon conveyed
by the heirs and passed by various mesne conveyances to
the appellants.
The United Staten, by virtue of its interest in the enforcement of the restriction against alienation, instituted
this suit to cancel these conveyances and also to set aside
the above-mentioned judgment. The case was heard upon
bill and answer, and a decree was rendered in favor of the
United States which was affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals. 191 Fed. Rep. 19.
The relations of the Government to these Indians, and
the legislation with respect to the lands occupied by them,
may be briefly stated. In 1832, the Piankeshaw and Wea
tribes of Indians ceded to the United States their interest
in lands within the States of Missouri and Illinois, and
lands were set apart for them in what is now the State of
Kansas (7 Stat. 410), adjoining the lands assigned to the
Peorias and Kaskaskias (7 Stat. 403). In 1854, the
Piankeshaws and Weas were united into a single tribe with
the Peorias and Kaskaskias, and the consolidated tribes
ceded to the United States all their interest in the tracts
theretofore assigned to them, reserving, in addition to

BOWLING v. UNITED STATES.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

certain sections which Were to be held as common property,
a specified quantity of land for each individual, the patents
for which were to be issued "subject to such restrictions
respecting leases and alienation, as the President or
Congress" might prescribe. (10 Stat. 1082; see The
Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 757, 758.) By the treaty of
February 23, 1867 (15 Stat. 513, 518, 519), provision was
made for the sale of the common tract in Kansas and for
the purchase with the proceeds of lands in the north-east
portion of what is at present the State of Oklahoma; and
to enable the Indians to dispose of their allotments in
Kansas, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to
remove the restrictions upon sale. In 1873 (c. 332, 17
Stat. 631), members of the tribe of Miamis, so electing,
were united with these confederated tribes under the
name of the United Peorias and Miamis. The territory
which they occupied was expressly excepted from the
operation of the general allotment act of February 8,
1887, c. 119, § 8, 24 Stat. 388, 391; but the provisions of
that statute, with certain exceptions, were extended to
these Indians by the act of March 2, 1889, c. 422, 25
Stat. 1013.
By the latter act, the Secretary of the Interior was
authorized to make an allotment of land to each member
subject to the following restriction:
"The land so allotted shall not be subject to alienation
for twenty-five years from the date of the issuance of
patent therefor, and said lands so allotted and patented
shall be exempt from levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a
like period of years. As soon as all the allotments or
selections shall have beem made as herein provided, the
Secretary of the Interior shall cause a patent to issue to
each and every person so entitled, for his or her allotment,
and such patent shall recite in the body thereof that the
land therein described and conveyed shall not be alienated
for twenty-five years from the date of said patent, and

OCTOBER TERM, 19i3.
Opinion of the Court.

233 U. S.

shall also recite that such land so allotted and patented is
not subject to levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a like
period of years, and that any contract or agreement to
sell or convey such land or allotments so patented entered
into before the expiration of said term of years shall be
absolutely null and void" (§ 1, p. 1014).
It was under this provision that the land here in question was patented to William Wea, the allottee.
The confederated Peoria Indians who received allotments were made citizens of the United States by the act
of May 2, 1890, c. 182, § 43, 26 Stat. 81, 99; and in 1897, it
was provided that adult allottees, who had received allotments of two hundred acres or more, might sell one hundred acres under such regulations as the Secretary of the
Interior might prescribe. Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30

Stat. 62, 72. Subsequent provisions permitted sales by
heirs of allottees, but only upon the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior. Acts of May 31, 1900, c. 598,
§ 7, 31 Stat. 221, 248; May 27, 1902, c. 888, § 7, 32 Stat.
245, 275.
It is contended by the appellants that when the allotment was made, and the allottee became a citizen of the
United States, the guardianship of the Government ceased.
But this contention is plainly untenable. Tiger v. Western
Investment Company, 221 U. S. 286. And it is no longer
open to question that the United States has capacity to sue
for the purpose of setting aside conveyances of lands
allotted to Indians under its care, where restrictions upon
alienation have been transgressed. Since the decision
below, the precise question has been determined by this
court in Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, and it
was there held that the authority to enforce restrictions
of this character is the necessary complement of the power
to impose them. It necessarily follows that, as a transfer
of the allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress
would be a violation of the governmental rights of the

BOWLING v. UNITED STATES.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

United States arising from its obligation to a dependent
people, no stipulations, contracts, or judgments rendered
in suits to which the Government is a stranger, can affect
its interest. The authority of the United States to enforce
the restraint lawfully created cannot be impaired by any
action without its consent. Heckman v. United States,
supra, p. 445. If, therefore, the conveyance by the
allottee's heirs, in the present case, would otherwise have
been subject to cancelation, it; was not saved by reascn
of the judgment entered in their suit against the purchaser.
The question then is, whether the restriction imposed
by the act of 1889 was a merely personal one, operative
only upon the allottee, or ran with the land binding his
heirs as well. This must be answered by ascertaining
the intent of Congress as expressed in the statute. The
restriction was not limited to "the lifetime of the allottee,"
as in Mullen v. United States, 224 U. S. 448, 453, nor was
the prohibition directed against conveyances made by the
allottee personally. Congress explicitly provided that
"the land so allotted" should not be subject to alienation
for twenty-five years from the date of patent. "Said
lands so allotted and patented." were to be exempt "from
levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a like period of years."
The patent was expressly to set forth that' "the land
therein described and conveyed" should not be alienated
during this period, and all contracts "to sell or convey
such land" which should b6 entered into "before the
expiration of said term of years" were to be absolutely
void. These reiterated statements of the restriction
clearly define its scope and effect. It bound the land for
the time stated, whether in the hands of the allottee or
of his heirs. Moreover, the subsequent legislation, relating to the same subject-matter, which expressly provided for conveyances by heirs of allottees subject to the
approval of the Secretary of the Interior, leaves no room

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.

No. 354.

Argued February 26, 27, 1914.-Decided May 4, 1914.

Where the judgment of the state court rests upon an independent or
non-Federal ground which is adequate to sustain it, this court has not
jurisdiction to review it.
Where, as in this case, the decision of the state court involves simply
the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction in accordance with the jurisprudence of the State, the ruling which prescribes the conditions of
relief is not reviewable by this court.
In this case held that the decision that a party seeking to redeem
lands might do so on equitable grounds only and on the equitable
condition that he pay the debt with legal interest, rested on a
non-Federal ground sufficient to sustain it and was not reviewable

here.
