No. 303.

Argued March 18, 1014.-:Decided April 27, 1914.

As the franchise involved in this case provides that the rates for supplying water may be fixed by a public body but so that the returns
shall not be less than a specified per cent. on the value of all the
property. actually used and useful to the appropriation and fur,nishing of the water, the value of the water rights owned by the
company must be taken into account in establishing such rates.

Complainant was not entitled to have its alleged water
rights valued by the Circuit Court, because it failed to
claim before the rate boards that it owned any water
rights, or to introduce any evidence of value of water
rights, or to refer to them in any manner.
The water rights cost complainant nothing.
Complainant was not entitled to have its alleged water
rights valued' because it diverted the waters from a public stream for public use, without cost to it for such waters.
The contracts under which complainant furnishes water
to Miller & Lux, its controlling stockholder, at less than
the county rates complained of were not made in consid-

eration of the conveyance by Miller & Lux to complainant
of any riparian or other water right.
The contract under which complainant furnishes Miller
& Lux free water for 20,000 acres of pasture land was not
made in consideration of any water right.
Even, should the value of the alleged water right be included, yet complainant should not recover and the bill of
complaint was properly dismissed since complainant donates 25.13 per cent of its receivable revenues under the
rates complained of to Miller & Lux, its controlling stockholder, under its discriminatory rate contracts with Miller
& Lux, and hence complainant has no standing in court
because the court should only enforce the constitutional
guaranties as to income actually receivable by complainant under the.rates complained of.
Complainant does not own the water right.
Irrespective of whether or not complainant paid anything for its alleged water rights, it is not entitled to have
them valued in a proceeding to fix rates, because under
the constitution of the State of California it has dedicated
its waters and water rights to a public use. Itis the mere
purveyor or carrier of the water for public use. The public served by complainant is the owner of the water rights.
Complainant is not entitled to have its alleged water
rights valued as part of its franchise.
Complainant is not entitled to have its alleged water
rights valued as increasing the value of its tangible properties; nor is complainant entitled to have its alleged water
rights valued as part of its "going. concern."
Complainant introduced no evidence of the value of
"going concern" or of "good-will."
Complainant has a monopoly, and hence is not entitled
to any valuation of "going concern," or "good-will."
The master and Circuit Court did not err in their valuation of the plant or in disallowing alleged appreciation
value. Appreciation was offset by the proved depreciation,

Complainant has not come into court with clean hands.
The total of the valuations of complainant's properties
made by the County Boards of Supervisors is not the total
valuation of complainant's plant, but is the total of the
valuations that the board respectively made of those
portions of the plant, both within and without the county,
that were useful to the counties respectively.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill to restrain 'the enforcement of orders passed
by the Boards of Supervisors of the three defendant
Counties, Stanislaus, Fresno and Merced, establishing
water rates to be charged by the plaintiff, the appellant;
the ground of the bill being that the orders deprive the
plaintiff of its property without due process of law. By
a statute of March 12, 1885, the Boards are authorized
to fix these rates for their several Counties, but so that the
returns to the parties furnishing the water shall be not
less than six per cent. upon the value of the 'canals,
ditches, flumes, chutes, and all other property actually
used and useful to the appropriation and furnishing of
such water.' The rates when fixed are binding for one
year and until established anew or abrogated. The bill
concerns rates fixed in 1907, and the question before the
court has been narrowed to a single issue. If the plaintiff
is entitled to six per cent. upon its, tangible property alone
it is agreed that the orders must stand. But if. the plaintiff has water rights that are to be taken into account, the
rates fiied will fall short of giving it what it is entitled to
and must be set aside. The Circuit Court dismissed the
bill, 191 Fed. Rep. 875, and on this appeal figures are
immaterial, the only question being whether the principle
adopted is right.

SAN JOAQUIN CO. v.. STANISLAUS COUNTY: 459.
233 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It was suggested to be sure at the argument that it does
not appear that the plaintiff offered any evidence as to
water rights at the hearing before the Supervisors, and
therefore that it ought not to be allowed to complain now
that nothing was allowed for them. But this evidently
is an afterthought. In general, a party may wait until a
law is passed or regulation is made and then insist upon
his constitutional rights. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line
Co., 211 U. S. 210, 227, 229. This we understand to be
the view of the California courts as to these very boards.
Spring Valley Water Works v. San Francisco,82 California,
286, 315. San Diego Water Co. v. San Diego, 118 California,
556, 564. Moreover as the defendants contend that the
plaintiff is entitled to no compensation for water rights,
to offer evidence would have been an idle form.
It is not disputed that the plaintiff has a right as against
riparian proprietors to withdraw the water that it distributes through its canals. Whether the right was paid
for, as the plaintiff says, or not, it has been confirmed by
prescription and is now beyond attack. It is not disputed
either that if the plaintiff were the owner of riparian lands
to which its water was distributed it would have a property in the water that could not be taken without compensation. But it is said that as the plaintiff appropriates
this water to distribution and sale it thereby dedicates
it to public use under California law and so loses its private
right in the same. It appears to us that when the cases
cited for this proposition are pressed to the conclusion
reached in the present case they are misapplied. No doubt
it is true that such an appropriation and use of the water
entitles those within reach of it to demand the use of a
reasonable share on payment. It well may be true that
if the waters were taken for a superior use by eminent
domain those whose lands were irrigated would be compensated for the loss. But even if the rate paid is not to
be determined as upon a purchase of water from the plain-

460

tiff, still, at the lowest, the plaintiff has the sole right to
furnish this water, the owner of the irrigated lands cannot
get it except through the plaintiff's help, and it would be
unjust not to take that fact into account in fixing the
rates. We are not called upon to decide what the rate
shall be, or even the principle by which it shall be measured. But it is proper to add a few words.
The declaration, in the Constitution of 1879 that water
appropriated for sale is appropriated to a public use must
be taken according to its subject-matter. The use is not
by the public at large, like that of the ocean for sailing,
but by certain individuals for their private benefit respectively. Thayer v. California Development Co., 164
California, 117, 128. Fallbrook IrrigationDistrictv. Bradley, 164 U. S. 112, 161. The declaration, therefore does not
necessarily mean more than that the few within reach of
the supply may demand it for a-reasonable price. The
roadbed of a railroad is devoted to a public use in a stricter
sense, yet the title of the railroad remains, and the use
though it may be demanded, must be paid for. In this
case it is said that a part of the water was appropriated
before the Constitution went into effect, and that a suit
now is pending to condemn more as against a riparian
proprietor, for which of course the plaintiff must pay. It
seems unreasonable to suppose that the Constitution
meant that if a party instead of using the water on his
own land, as he may, sees fit to distribute it to others he
loses the rights that he has bought or lawfully acquired:
Recurring to the fact that in every instance only a few
specified individuals get the right to a supply, and that it
clearly appears from the latest statement of the Supreme
Court of California, Palmer v. Railroad Commission, January 20, 1914, 47 Cal. Dec., 201, that the water when
appropriated is private property, it is unreasonable to
suppose that the constitutional declaration meant to compel a gift from the former owner to the users and that in

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 184.

Argued January 22, 1914.-Decided April 27, 1914.

A trade-mark consisting of an ordinary surname is not the subject of
exclusive appropriation as a common-law trade-mark, but may,
under the fourth proviso of ยง 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, be
validly registered if in use for ten years next preceding the passage
of that act in the'manner specified therein.
A. proviso in a statute will not be so construed as to have little or nothing to act upon aild to have no reason for its insertion.
The fourth proviso of ยง 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 modifies the
.general limitations contained ib the second proviso of the same section against the use of personali and geographical names and terms
descriptive of character and quality.
In enacting the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 and inserting the provisos in
ยง 5 thereof, Congress did not intend to provide for a barren notice of
an ineffectual claim, but to confer definite rights, and an applicant
properly registering under the act becomes the owner of the trademark and entitled to be protected in its use as such.
