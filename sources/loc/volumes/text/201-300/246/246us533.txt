the land comprised within the right of way. To have excepted this strip from the reservation would have divided it in two; and would have rendered it much more
difficult, if not impossible, to afford that protection to the
Indians which the provisions quoted were designed to
ensure. The case of Clairmont v. United States, 225 U. S.

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.

No. 567. Argued March 7, 1918.-Decided April 15, 1918.
Section 5209, Rev. Stats., punishing embezzlements and false entries
by any "president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent" of a
national bank, does not apply to a receiver of such a bank, appointed
by the Comptroller of the Currency under Rev. Stats., § 5234; he
is an officer of the United States and not an agent of the bank.
Statutes creating and defining crimes are not to be extended by intendment upon the ground that they should have been made more comprehensive.

Affrmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for the United
States:
The powers, functions, and duties of a national bank
receiver are such as to constitute him an "agent" of the
bank, within the broad meaning of that word, as used

in Revised Statutes, § 5209. It should be noted that a
statutory receiver of a national banking association is
not the officer of, nor appointed by, or responsible to,
any court. In re Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443, 458. He is
appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency to act for
the bank, in pursuance of special statutory provisions
whence the receiver derives his powers and to which he
must look for guidance in the performance of his functions.
He is paid out of the funds of the bank; he takes the
place of the bank; his signature is the signature of the
bank. The efficient liquidation of a bank usually requires
considerable negotiation; it may require various contracts which do not immediately operate to liquidate its
assets; the receiver conducts many transactions in behalf
of the bank while engaged in the general process of liquidation; and in these transactions he may be said to represent the bank and all those who own an interest in the
business of the bank. That he acts for the bank, as well
as for the creditors, is clear, since in many cases, after
payment of creditors, the receiver turns back assets to
the bank either for continuance of business by it or for
liquidation by an agent chosen by the bank, as provided
in the Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156, § 3, 19 Stat. 63. Bank
v. Kennedy, 17 Wall. 19, 22, 23.
The appointment of the receiver does not work dissolution of the bank or affect suits pending against it, or incapacitate it from suing or being sued. Its corporate
existence continues after the appointment of a receiver
and until its affairs have been finally wound up. Chemical
National Bank v. Hartford Deposit Co., 161 U. S. 1, 7;
Bank of Bethel v. PahquiogueBank, 14 Wall. 383, 400.
In Rosenblatt v. Johnston, 104 U. S. 462, 463, it is said
that the bank's "property and assets, in legal contemplation, still belong to the bank, though in the hands of
a receiver, to be administered under the law. The bank
did not cease to exist on the appointment of the receiver."

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.
533.

Argument for the United States.

A receivership may be of a temporary or provisional
nature, and may last only long enough to satisfy the
Comptroller that the bank is not insolvent, or that the
facts do not present a case for a receiver as provided by
the statute. See Jackson v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 75
Fed. Rep. 359, 364.
In Case v. Terrell, 11 Wall. 199, it was held that the
receiver of a national bank represents the bank, its stockholders, and creditors, and that neither he nor the Comptroller of the Currency can subject the Government to
the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to determine the
conflicting claims of the United States and other creditors
in the hands of such a bank. In the course of the opinion,
it was said (p. 202): "He represents the bank, its stockholders, its creditors, and does not in any sense represent
the Government." See Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498,
506.
Revised Statutes, § 5209, was intended to cover the
whole ground of defalcations which might be committed
by all those who might have any connection with, or
control over, the assets, funds, credits, books and papers
of a national bank. In the first place, it should be particularly noted that although the National Bank Act was
passed in 1863-55 years ago-this case is the first instance, so far as the reports show, in which the contention
has ever been raised that an embezzling national bank
receiver was not punishable under the act, like any other
embezzling representative of the bank. Since it would
strain the credulity of the hardiest optimist as to human
nature to believe that this is the first instance of a dishonest bank receiver, it would seem that the point would
have been taken by some keen attorney during these 55
years "if it had been supposed by anyone that such legislation" failed to provide for such prosecution. Fairbanks
v. United States, 181 U. S. 283, 323.
Embezzlement by a receiver falls squarely within the

evil at which the section was aimed, and the statute
should be so construed as to effectuate its evident intent.
The statute punishes the acts of three classes of persons:
(a) president, director, cashier, teller; (b) clerk; (c) agent.
The first class (a) are referred to in the section as "officers," for it provides that "every person who with like
intent aids or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any
violation of this section," etc. These three classes of
persons were clearly intended to include every person
acting for the bank who would have any control over its
funds, credits, books, or papers. See Commonwealth v.
Wyman, 8 Mete. 247, 252; State v. Barter, 58 N. I. 604,
605; Wynegar v. State, 157 Indiana, 577, 579, 580; Clement
v. Canfield, 28 Vermont, 302, 304.
The Government contends that the word "agent," in
the first line of the section, should, in order to effectuate
the full purpose, be given as reasonable a construction
as this court gave to the word "agent" in the twelfth
line of the same section in United States v. Corbett, 215
U. S. 233.
The lower court's decision will have this result: That
a national bank clerk may be indicted under a statute
which affixes a minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment, whereas a national bank receiver may be indicted
in a federal court (if at all) only under a statute which
contains no minimum penalty and makes it possible for
him to escape with a simple fine (Federal Criminal Code,
§97). The Government contends that it is the clear
duty of this court to so construe § 5209 as to avoid any
such unjust and ridiculous result.
A national bank receiver is not an officer of any court
and has not the status of a judicial receiver. He is simply
a liquidating agent provided for the bank by the statute.
In accepting its charter, the bank accepts all the provisions of the National Bank Act, including the provision
for appointment of such a liquidating agent or receiver;

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.

Argument for the United States.

and when such a receiver is appointed as such an agent
by the Comptroller, his appointment is impliedly authorized by the bank.
An agent may be constituted either by express act, or
by implication, or by ratification, or by acceptance of
statutory conditions, or by operation of law. Mechem
on Agency, 2d ed., 1914, § 26. A corporation for certain
purposes ,may be conclusively deemed to assent to the
appointment by statute of an agent to accept service.
It is well-established law that the charter of a corporation
embraces the provisions of law contained in the special
or general statute under which the organization is formed;
and the corporation accepts all such provisions as part
of its charter. Each national bank, therefore, impliedly
consents to the appointment of such an agent to act for
it upon the happening of any of the stipulated contingencies, and it accordingly assents to the authorized acts
of such receiver when duly appointed.
The Government contends that the doctrines relative
to judicial receivers are not in any way pertinent, and
that the text books and cases which state broadly that a
judicial receiver is not the agent of the corporation (see
Metz v. Buffalo &c. R. R., 58 N. Y. 61, 66; State v. Hubbard, 58 Kansas, 797, 801), do not apply in any way to
this statutory bank receiver. If the statute, instead of
saying in § 5234, "The Comptroller of the Currency may
forthwith appoint a receiver," had said that he might
appoint "an agent," or a "superintendent," or a "liquidator," the attempt to apply to such an appointee
judicial decisions which referred solely to court receivers
would never have been made. Union Bank of Brooklyn v. Kanturk Realty Corporation, 72 Misc. (N. Y.)
96, 97.
A distinction between a "chancery, or, as it is sometimes called, a common receiver," and a statutory receiver
is taken in Stokes v. Hoffman House, 157 N. Y. 554, 559;

and referred to in Quincy, Missouri & Pacifc R. R. Co.
v. Humphreys, 145 U. S. 82, 97.
The functions and duties of a receiver are substantially
the same as those of liquidating agent of the bank provided for impliedl under Rev. Stats., § 5220, and expressly under § 3 of the Act of June 30, 1876. Such a
liquidating agent and a receiver both represent the bank
in its corporate capacity, and act for its benefit. A
liquidating agent has been held by the courts to be indict.
able under Rev. Stats., § 5209.
In Jewett v. United States, 100 Fed. Rep. 832, it was
held that a liquidating agent, who was appointed in
voluntary dissolution under § 5220, was an "agent"
within the meaning of § 5209. Other statutes, moreover,
provide expressly for another liquidating agent, i. e.,
an agent to be appointed by the shareholders to take
over the bank's affairs after the receiver has ended his
duties. See Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156, § 3, 19 Stat. 63.
Of such an agent it was said, in McConville v. Gilmour,
36 Fed. Rep. 277: "The 'agent' is only the 'receiver'
under another name. . . . Each of these administrative
officials-the 'receiver' and the 'agent'--represent the
bank in its corporate capacity, and neither of them is
more or less than the other such a representative." The
same view was taken in Guarantee Co. of North Dakota v.
Hanway, 104 Fed. Rep. 369, 372. A "liquidating agent"
appointed by the shareholders is indictable under § 5209
as an "agent." See Jewett v. United States, supra.
A decision that a receiver is an officer of the United
States within the purview of the federal criminal laws
will be attended by the following extraordinary results:
First. That from the year 1863 to the year 1879, an
embezzling receiver of a national bank could not have
been prosecuted under any federal criminal statute; for
it was not until the latter year that, by the Act of February 3, 1879, c. 42 (20 Stat. 280; now § 97 of the Federal

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.
533.

Argument for the United States.

Criminal Code), it was first made a crime for an officer
of the United States to embezzle any money or property
which came into his possession or under his control in
the execution of his office.
Second. That from the year 1876 to the year 1879, a
liquidating agent of a national bank appointed under the
Act of June 30, 1876, § 3, apparently could not have been
prosecuted for embezzlement under any federal criminal
statute; for Guarantee Co. of North Dakota v. Hanway,
szpra, held that such a liquidating agent is an officer of
the United States "in every sense in which the receiver
is"

Neither the manner of appointment, method of payment of salary, nor duration or tenure of office are such
as to constitute a national bank receiver an officer of the
United States. His appointment is by the Comptroller
of the Currency, and is not required to be approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury (Rev. Stats., § 5234); he
is paid out of the assets of the bank before distribution
of the proceeds (Rev. Stats., § 5238); and he is appointed
for no definite time, and for no fixed statutory salary.
Such a receiver clearly does not come within the purview of the term "officer of the United States" as that
term is construed in criminal statutes. United States v.
Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385; United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S.
508, 510; United States v. Mouat, 124 U. S. 303, 307;
United States v. Smith, 124 U. S. 525, 533; Martin v.
United States, 168 Fed. Rep. 198; Scully v. United States,

Rep. 974. Cf. Thompson v. Pool, 70 Fed. Rep. 725, 727,
728.
The fact that for the limited purpose of suing in the
federal courts a national bank receiver has been held to
be an officer of the United States, as that term is used
in statutes granting jurisdiction to federal courts, is not
incompatible with the status of the receiver as an agent

of the bank. To this extent, he acts in a dual capacity.
Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 504; Price v. Abbott, 17
Fed. Rep. 506-508.
It seems clear, however, that the decisions only go to
the limited extent of holding a receiver to be an officer
of the United States within the meaning of that term in
certain special jurisdictional statutes; e. g., Rev. Stats.,
§ 563, cI. 4; § 629, el. 3; § 380.
There is nothing unusual in one term having two distinct meanings in two different statutes (Lamarv. United
States, 240 U. S. 60, 65); and the best illustration of this
fact is to be found in two consecutive cases in 124 U. S.,
in which in United States v. Mouat, p. 303, a paymaster's
clerk was held not to be an "officer of the Navy" within
the meaning of the Act of June 30, 1876, c. 159, 19 Stat.
65, whereas in United States v. Hendee, p. 309, a paymaster's clerk was held to be an "officer of the Navy"
within the meaning of the Act of March 3, 1883, c. 97, 22
Stat. 473.
Mr. A. E. Stricklett, with whom Mr. Jackson H. Ralston
was on the briefs, for defendant in error.
MR. JusTIce BRANDEIs delivered the opinion of the
court.
The Comptroller of the Currency is charged with the
duty of supervising national banks. When he deems it
necessary to take possession of the assets of a bank and
assume control of its operations, he appoints a receiver
under Rev. Stats., § 5234. Weitzel, so appointed receiver,
was indicted in the District Court of the United States
for the Eastern District of Kentucky under Rev. Stats.,
§ 5209, for embezzlement and making false entries. That
section does not mention receivers, but provides that
"every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent"

Opinion of the Court.

of a national bank who commits these offences shall be
punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor
more than ten years. The Government contended that
the receiver was an "agent" within the meaning of the act.
A demurrer to the indictment was sustained on the ground
that he is not. The court discharged the prisoner and the
case comes here under the Criminal Appeals Act of
March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
The receiver, unlike a president, director, cashier, or
teller, is an officer, not of the corporation, but of the United
States. In re Chetwood, 165 U. S. 443, 458. As such he
gives to the United States a bond for the faithful discharge
of his duties; pays to the Treasurer of the United States
moneys collected; and makes to the Comptroller reports of
his acts and proceedings. Rev. Stats., §5234. Being an
officer of the United States he is represented in court by the
United States attorney for the district, subject to the
supervision of the Solicitor of the Treasury, § 380. Gibson v. Peters, 150 U. S. 342. And because he is such
officer, a receiver has been permitted to sue in the federal
court regardless of citizenship or of the amount in controversy. Price v. Abbott, 17 Fed. Rep. 506. In a sense
he acts on behalf of the bank. The appointment of a
receiver does not dissolve the corporation, Chemical National Bank v. Hartford Deposit Co., 161 U. S. 1, 7; the
assets remain its property, Rosenblatt v. Johnston, 104
U. S.462; the receiver deals with the assets and protects
them for whom it may concern, including the stockholders; and his own compensation and expenses are
a charge upon them. §5238. But a receiver is appointed
only when the condition of the bank or its practices make
intervention by the Government necessary for the protection of noteholders or other creditors.' While the receivership continues the corporation is precluded from
ISee Rev. State., §§ 5234, 5141, 5151, 5191, 5201, 5205, 5208.

246 U. S.

dealing by its officers or agents in any way with its assets.
And when all creditors are satisfied or amply protected the
receiver may be discharged by returning the bank to the
control of its stockholders or by the appointment of a liquidating agent under Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156, 19 Stat. 63.
Whether, as the Government assumes, such statutory
agent who is elected by the stockholders is included under
term "agent" as used in § 5209, we have no occasion to
determine. The question was expressly left undecided in
Jewett v. United States, 100 Fed. Rep. 832, 840. But the
assumption, if correct, would not greatly aid its contention.
The law can conceive of an agent appointed by a superior authority; but the term "agent" is ordinarily used
as implying appointment by a principal on whose behalf
he acts. The fact that in this section the words " clerk, or
agent" follow "president, director, cashier, teller" tends,
under the rule of noscitur a sociis, to confirm the inference.
United States v. Saten, 235 U. S. 237, 249. Furthermore,
the term "agent of a bank" would ill describe the office
of receiver.
Section 5209 is substantially a rednactment of § 52 of the
Act of February 25, 1863, c. 58, 12 Stat. 665, 680, the first
National Bank Act. It is urged by the Government, that
the punishment of defalcation by a receiver is clearly
within the reason of the statute and that, unless the term
"agent" be construed as including receivers, there was no
federal statute under which an embezzling receiver of a
national bank could have been prosecuted, at least until
the Act of February 3, 1879, c. 42, 20 Stat. 280, made officers of the United States so liable therefor; and, indeed,
cannot now be, because he should not be held to be an
officer. The argument is not persuasive. Congress may
possibly have believed that a different rule should be applied to an officer of the United States who is selected by the
Comptroller for a purpose largely different from that performed by officers of the bank, and who gives bond for the

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.

Opinion of the Court.

faithful discharge of his duties. Furthermore a casus
omissus is not unusual, particularly in legislation introducing a new system.' The fact that in 1879 Congress
should have found it necessary to enact a general law
for the punishment of officers of the United States who
embezzle property entrusted to them, but not owned by
the United States, shows both how easily a casu omissus
may arise and how long a time may elapse before the defect is discovered or is remedied. Statutes creating and
defining crimes are not to be extended by intendment
because the court thinks the legislature should have made
them more comprehensive. Todd v. United States, 158
