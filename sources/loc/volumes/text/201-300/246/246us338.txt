with the stipulation under which it purported to be
taken; nor can it be denied that the duty of the Postmaster General, and of the defendant as his deputy,
was executive in character, not ministerial, and required
an exercise of official discretion. And neither the question of official authority nor that of official discretion is
affected, for present purposes, by assuming or conceding,
for the purposes of the argument, that the proposed action may have been unwarranted by the terms of the
contract and such as to constitute an actionable breach
of that contract by the United States. See Noble v.
Union River Logging Railroad, 147 U. S. 165, 171, and
cases cited; Belknap v. Schild, 161 U. S. 10, 17, 18;

The United States has consented to be sued in the
Court of Claims and in the District Courts upon claims
of a certain class, and not otherwise. Hence, without
considering other questions discussed by the courts below or raised by appellant in this court, we conclude
that the dismissal of the bill was not erroneous.
Decree affirmed.

No. 144.

COURT OF CLAIMS.

Argued January 28, 1918.-Decided March 18, 1918.

Under the Act of June 16, 1880, c. 243, 1 Stat. 284, as amended
March -3, 1881, c. 134, 21 Stat. 566, conferring jurisdiction on the
Court of Claims over certain claims against the District of Columbia,

Opinion of the Court.

a claimant is not entitled to receive interest as such, save any that
may accrue after rendition of the judgment, where the recovery is
not based upon a contract expressly stipulating for interest. Rev.
Stats., § 1091.
The provision of § 6 of the Act of 1880, supra, for satisfying such judgments with bonds bearing coupons for interest from the date upon
which the claims were due and payable, amounted to giving interest,
at a limited rate, before and after judgment, where payment was
made in that mode; but where the amount of such bonds remaining
unissued, of the maximum authorized by that section, was less than
the amount of the claim allowed, the Court of Claims properly adjudged that, with respect to any part of the claim not paid in that
special manner, there was no right to interest prior to the rendition
of the judgment.
Affrmed.
THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. John Raum, with whom Mr. V. B. Edwards was on
the briefs, for appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Th~nmpson for appellee.
MR. JusTicE Prrmy delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal by claimant in a suit that was commenced by her testator in the Court of Claims in the year
1880, under Act of June 16, 1880, c. 243, 21 Stat. 284. A
judgment was rendered in claimant's favor after the
amendatory Act of February 13, 1895, c. 87, 28 Stat. 664
(Johnson v. District of Columbia, 31"Ct. Clms. 395), which
judgment was reversed by this court in 1897, and the
cause remanded for further proceedings (District of Columbia v. Johnson, 165 I. S. 330). After a long delay,
proceedings were had which resulted in a judgment in
favor of claimant February 21, 1916, from which the District of Columbia has not appealed.
Claimant's appeal relates to the question of interest

upon the amount recovered. The form of the judgment
is that the claimant "do have and recover of and from
the District of Columbia in the manner provided by the
Act of June 16, 1880, Chapter 243, Seven thousand three
hundred and six dollars and twenty-five cents ($7,306.25).

Said amounts were due and payable April 1, 1876, but
said judgment shall bear interest only from the date of
its rendition, and is payable as provided by section 6 of
the Act of June 16, 1880 (21 Stat. L., p. 284), as amended
by the Act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. L., p. 466)." There
is no finding that the claim is based upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.
It is insisted that the court erred in allowing interest
only from the date of judgment, rather than from April 1,
1876, the day on which the claim became due and payable.
The Act of 1880, in its first section, conferred jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims over all claims then existing against the District of Columbia arising out of certain operations of the District government during the
preceding decade; and as to procedure it declared: "Said
Court of Claims shall have the same power, proceed in
the same manner, and be governed by the same rules, in
respect to the mode of hearing, adjudication, and determination of said claims, as it now has in relation to the
adjudication of claims against the United States." This,
if it stood alone, would leave the question of interest to
be governed by the general principle that interest is not
recoverable from the government, embodied in § 1091,
Rev. Stats.: "No interest shall be allowed on any claim
up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by
the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly
stipulating for the payment of interest," still in force as
§ 177, Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1141, c. 231.
But other sections of the Act of 1880 contain provisions that must be considered. By § 5 it was enacted that,
where no appeal was taken, or on affirmance of a judgment

in favor of the claimant, "the sum due thereby shall be
paid, as hereinafter provided, by the Secretary of the
Treasury," upon presentation to him of a copy of the
judgment properly certified. And by § 6 the Secretary
was authorized to demand of the sinking fund commissioner of the District of Columbia so many of the 3.65
per cent. bonds authorized by Act of Congress approved
June 20, 1874, c. 337, 18 Stat. 120, and amendatory acts,
as might be necessary for the payment of the judgments;
"which bonds shall be received by said claimants at par
in payment of such judgments, and shall bear date August first, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and mature
at the same time as other bonds of this issue; Provided,
That before the delivery of such bonds as are issued in
payment of judgments rendered as aforesaid on the claims
aforesaid, the coupons shall be detached therefrom from
the date of said bonds to the day upon which such claims
were due and payable; and the gross amount of such bonds
heretofore and hereafter issued shall not exceed in the
aggregate fifteen millions of dollars." By amendment
of March 3, 1881, c. 134, 21 Stat. 458, 566, the Treasurer
of the United States as ez officio sinking fund commissioner
was authorized, whenever in his opinion it would be more
advantageous for the interest of the District of Columbia to do so, to sell the bonds and pay the judgments
from the proceeds of the sales instead of delivering the
bonds to the claimants.
Under the Act of 1880, the Court of Claims held that
it was necessary it should determine when the claims
were due and payable within the meaning of the act, and
specify the date in the judgment, in order that the Secretary of the Treasury might know what coupons, if any,
were to be detached from bonds delivered by him in payment. FendaU's Case, 16 Ct. Chms. 106, 121. See District of Columbiav. Johnson, 165 U. S. 330, 336.

tion with § 1091, Rev. Stats., it is plain that the claimant in such a judgment is not entitled to a recovery of
interest as such, saving any that may accrue after the
rendition of the judgment, unless the recovery be based
upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of
interest. Section 6, however, provided a special fund out of
which claims of this character might be paid, and as this
consisted of coupon bonds dated in 1874 and maturing
50 years later, the provision to the effect that coupons
maturing after the date upon which the claim was due
and payable should accompany the bonds amounted to
giving interest at a limited rate, before and after judgment, where payment was made in that mode.
But this special mode of payment was qualified by a
proviso that the gross amount of such bonds should not
exceed $15,000,000; and, as it happens, all except $2,700
had been issued prior to the entry of the judgment now
under review. This is admitted in appellant's brief, and
may be additionally verified by reference to Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the
Finances for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915, p. 122;
like report for the following fiscal year, p. 92.
It was not erroneous for the Court of Claims to take
note of the fact that, at the utmost, only a part of the
claim could be paid in bonds or from the proceeds of
bonds, and that with respect to any part not paid in this
special manner there was no right to interest prior to the
rendition of the judgment. This is the effect/of the judgment as entered.
Afirmed.
