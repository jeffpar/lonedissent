APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
Nos. 609, 610. Argued January 18, 19, 1922; restored to docket for
reargument February 27, 1922; reargued April 10, 11, 1922.-Decided May 29, 1922.
1. Upon an appeal under the Expedition Act of February -11, 1903,
as modified by Jud. Code, ยง 291, from a decree entered under a
mandate of this court directing the dissolution of a combination in
restraint of interstate trade, this court has jurisdiction, of its own
motion and independently of the assignments of error, to determine whether the mandate has been properly complied with and
to require such compliance. P. 165.
2. A plan decreed by the District Court (summarized in the opinion,
post, 166,) for dissolving the combination adjudged unlawful in
United States v. Reading Co., 253 U. S. 26, approved, in so far as
it provides: for merging the Philadelphia & Reading Railway
Company in the Reading Company, shorn of corporate
capacity to do other than a railroad business; for separating
the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. from the
Reading Company by sale or disposition of the shares
of the former held by the latter (p. 175); for separating the
Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company by sale of its stock held
by the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey (p. 175); and
for separating the Reading Company from the Philadelphia &
Reading Coal & Iron Company by transfer of all the stock of the
latter (held by the former) to a new coal company, to be organized by trustees of the court, the stock of which shall be issued
under conditions assuring that those who acquire it shall not be
interested in the Reading Company;-but disapproved, in so far
as it leaves the capital stock and properties of the Philadelphia
& Reading Coal & Iron Company subject to the lien of an out-

standing general mortgage covering also much of the property of
the Reading Railway Company, payment of which, as between
these two, is assumed by the Reading Company, and in so far as
it provides that the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company
shall give a new mortgage of all its property to secure bonds to be
delivered by it to the Reading Company in the adjustment of their
financial relations. P. 167.
3. The court has power under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, in dissolving a combination of two corporations, to disregard the letter
and legal effect of a general mortgage of their properties and of the
bonds secured thereby, in order to achieve the purpose of the act.
P. 171. United States v. Southern Pacific Co., post, 214.
4. In this case, the general mortgage of the Reading Company and
the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company gave notice on
its face of the unlawful union and purpose of which it was the
necessary instrument, and those who took the bonds thus secured,
although they may have done so innocently, relying on legal
advice and surrendering valid underlying liens created before the
Sherman Act, hold them subject to the judicial power to free the
two properties from the consolidating tendency of the mortgage by
relieving one of them from the lien and substituting a judicial
equivalent in protection of the bondholders. P. 171.
5. The decree in this case should modify the liability under the general mortgage and bonds so that the obligation of each mortgagor
company upon the bonds, and the lien upon its property, shall be
reduced to an amount proportionate to the ratio of the value of its
property subject to the mortgage to the value of all the property
so mortgaged, and should make specific provisions for foreclosure
of the resulting separate liens in case of default. P. 173.
6. Any injury to the security caused by this modification of the terms
of the debt and mortgage may be compensated by such payment
to the bondholders, by either or both mortgagor companies, as may
seem equitable and convenient. P. 174.
7. Authority is given the District Court to amend the plan of dissolution for the purpose of leaving the Reading Company properly
financed, and to make such detailed changes as, after full hearing
of all the parties, it may find practically necessary in following the
general outlines of the modifications here made. P. 174.
8. The decree should provide not only that all stockholders of the
new coal company, upon receiving and registering their stock, shall
make affidavits that they are not owners or the agents or representatives of owners of stock in the Reading Company, but also

should require the merged Reading Company to adopt a by-law,
effective until the further order of the court, permitting registration of transfers of its stock only in the names of persons who make
affidavit that they are not stockholders of the new or old coal companies and have not been and are not holders of proxies to vote
shares therein. P. 175.
9. The plan of dissolution provides that the stock of the new coal
company shall be disposed of primarily by sale to the preferred
and common stockholders of the Reading Company, share and
share alike, of assignable certificates exchangeable for the new coal
company's shares by holders who prove at the time that they are
not stockholders or representing stockholders of the Reading Company or in any agreement in its interest for the control of the coal
company. Held:
(a) That the so-called sale is in effect a distribution of forbidden
surplus assets of the Reading Company to its stockholders, small
payments being required for the purpose of providing the company
with additional capital for the operation of its railway system.
P. 176.
(b) That the distribution as between the preferred and common
stockholders must be determined by the organization agreement of
the Reading Company defining their rights and must be pro rata,
whether under that agreement the net profits of any past year,
after paying preferred shareholders their full percentage, may be
divided among the common stockholders or not, since the declaring
of any dividend is left to the honest discretion of the board of
directors, and undivided profits are to be regarded as capital assets
and distributed on liquidation, the board not having applied them
as dividends. P. 177.
10. It is a general rule that stockholders, common and preferred,
share alike in the assets of a liquidating corporation, if the preference be only as to dividends. P. 181.
11. Whether, under the federal Commodities Clause and the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it will be proper and lawful that the Reading Company, becoming reorganized as a railroad corporation,
continue to own stock of the Reading Iron Company, an iron
manufacturing concern, will be determined, and the plan of dissolution modified accordingly, by the District Court. P. 181.

Statement of the Case.

court in United States v. Reading Co., 253 U. S. 26, is in
accordance therewith, and second, whether it does equity
to the appellants.
The original suit was instituted by the United States to
dissolve the relation existing between the Reading Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the
Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, all corporations of Pennsylvania, the Central Railroad Company
of New Jersey, a corporation of New Jersey, and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, a corporation of
Pennsylvania, as a combination to restrain and monopolize
interstate commerce in anthracite coal, and to violate the
Commodities Clause of the Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,
34 Stat. 585.
This court found that by a scheme of reorganization,
adopted in December, 1895, the Philadelphia & Reading
Railway Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal
& Iron Company combined to deliver into the complete
control of the board of directors of a holding company, the
Reading Company, all of the property of much the largest
single coal company operating in the Schuylkill field, and
almost one thousand miles of railway over which its coal
must find its access to interstate markets, and that this
constituted a combination unduly to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in anthracite coal; that the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company had thereafter but
one stockholder, the Reading Company, and that thus the
Reading Company served to pool the property, the activities and the profits of the three companies. The court
further found that through the acquisition by the Reading
Company of a majority of the stock of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey which itself owned 90 per
cent. of the stock in the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, the illegal power of the combination was greatly increased, and that the relation of common control through

259 U. S.

stock ownership of the Philadelphia & Reading Railway
Company and the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron
Company, and that of the Central Railroad Company of
New Jersey and the Lehigh Valley & Wilkes-Barre Coal
Company were violations of the commodities clause, requiring dissolution. The court, therefore, remanded the
case to the District Court directing a decree in conformity
to the opinion dissolving the whole combination of the
four companies with the Reading Company and such disposition of the shares of stocks and bonds and other property of the Reading Company as might be necessary to establish the entire independence of each company from the
others, to the end that the affairs of all of them might be
conducted in harmony with law.
For convenience the Philadelphia & Reading Railway
Company will be called the Reading Railway Company,
the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company the
Reading Coal Company, the Central Railroad Company
of New Jersey the New Jersey Railroad Company, and the
Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company the Wilkes-Barre
Coal Company.
The situation at the time the District Court was directed to enter its decree was as followsz The Reading
Company, the holding.company, had a special charter under the laws of Pennsylvania granted prior to the adoption
of the constitution of that State of 1874, with unusually
broad powers. It was not engaged directly in operating
a railroad and was not subject to regulation by federal or
state authorities having jurisdiction over common carriers.
It owned the entire capital stock of the Reading Railway
Company, being $42,481,700 par value, and $20,000,000
of its bonds; $8,000,000, par value, being the entire capital
stock of the Reading Coal Company; the real estate, rolling stock and floating equipment used upon or in connection with the Reading Railway System; shares of stock
and bonds of other railroads and terminal companies, con-

CONTINENTAL CO. v. UNITED STATES.

Statement of the Case.

stituting a part of the Reading Railway System; $14,504,000, par value, being more than a majority, of the stock
of the New Jersey Railroad Company, all of which was
pledged except forty shares under a collateral trust mortgage to secure $23,000,000 worth of bonds. These were
not all its holdings, but they are all that are important
here.
On January 5, 1897, the Reading Company and the
Reading Coal Company jointly gave a mortgage to the
Central, now the Central Union Trust Company of New
York, trustee, hereafter to be referred to as the general
mortgage. The security under this mortgage was all the
property of the Reading Coal Company and all of its
capital stock, together with all of the capital stock of the
Reading Railway Company and all the railroad equipment
and certain real estate essential to the operation of the
Reading Railway Company, which was held by the Reading Company, together with certain bonds of the Railway
Company. The bonds now outstanding under this mortgage amount in round figures to $93,000,000.
A combination of the Reading Railway Company and
the Reading Coal Company had been maintained for
years and the property of the Reading Coal Company had
been greatly enlarged by purchases and improvements
through money advanced by the Reading Railway Company, resulting in an indebtedness of the Reading Coal
Company to the Reading Railway Company which ultimately amounted to about $70,000,000. In 1896, when
the Reading Company became the holding company
under the then formed combination, this indebtedness of
the Coal Company to the Railway Company appeared as
a credit on the *books of the Reading Company, and a
debit on the books of the Coal Company, but it is quite
clear that they were mere bookkeeping entries and that
it had been agreed that they should be canceled. They
are canceled in the proposed plan.

-OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Statement of the Case.

259 U. S.

Under tho plan embodied in the decree of the District
Court, the Reading Company is as between it and the
Reading Coal Company to assume the whole liability
under the general mortgage, and agrees to save the Coal
Company and its property harmless therefrom. The
Reading Company is to receive from the Reading Coal
Company $10,000,000 in cash or current assets, and $25,000,000 in 4 per cent. bonds of the Reading Coal Company, secured by mortgage on its properties. The Reading Company is to transfer its interest, subject to the lien
of the general mortgage, in all the stock of the present
Reading Coal Company, amounting to eight million dollars in par value but actually worth many times that
amount, including the right to vote and receive dividends
thereon, to a new Reading Coal Company, a corporation
to be created under the supervision of the District Court,
and over which that court is to retain control so as to
prevent its being used to thwart the decree.
The new Coal Company agrees to issue as its total capital stock 1,400,000 shares without par value, to a trustee
or trustees appointed by the District Court, who are to
transfer to the Reading Company assignable certificates
of interest in the stock of the new Coal Company, for distribution to its stockholders. The certificates are to be
exchangeable for such stock only when accompanied by
an affidavit, stating among other things that the holder is
not an owner of any stock of the Reading Company and
is not acting for or on behalf of any stockholder of the
Reading Company, or in concert, agreement or understanding with any other person, firm or corporation for
the control of the Coal Company in the interest of the
Reading Company, but in his own behalf in good faith.
The certificates of interest are to be offered for so-called
sale by the Reading Company to its stockholders, preferred and common, share and share alike, for $2.00 for
each share of the Reading Company. Such stockholders

Statement of the Case.

can not, however, continue as stockholders of the Reading
Company and become stockholders of the new Coal Company during the conversion period, but each must dispose
of his certificates of interest in the new Coal Company or
of his stock in the Reading Company. If, after July 1,
1924, any of the certificates shall remain outstanding, the
court in its discretion and after a hearing may order the
shares covered by such certificates to be sold and the proceeds distributed to the owners of such certificates. The
Attorney General is given access to the transfer books
of both companies to enforce compliance with the order.
This secures to the Reading Company in cash $5,600,000.
Second: The Reading Company will merge into itself
the Reading Railway Company and all the railway property of the Reading Railway Company is to be made subject to the direct lien of the general mortgage. The existing charter of the Reading Company authorizes such a
merger. The Reading Company is to accept the Pennsylvania constitution of 1874, and to proceed under the
Pennsylvania Act of 1856 to surrender those of its franchises which are inappropriate for a railroad corporation
of Pennsylvania. It will thus become a railway company subject in all respects to the regulation of the state
and federal authorities as a common carrier.
Third: The Reading Company is to transfer to trustees
appointed by the District Court, subject to the lien of the
collateral trust mortgage already mentioned, all of its interest in the stock of the New Jersey Railroad Company.
The final disposition of this stock is to be deferred in view
of the possible groupings of railroads by the Interstate
Commerce Commission under the Transportation Act of
1920, but is to be subject to an order of sale by the court
in its discretion before that time. The trustees are directed to select directors and secure a management of the
New Jersey Railroad Company entirely independent of

164

Statement of the Case.

259 U. S.

the Reading Company, which shall discharge its duties
under the supervision of the court.
Fourth: The stock of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company,
held by the New Jersey Railroad -Company is by the decree to be sold to persons not stockholders of the New
Jersey Railroad Company, the Reading Company, the
Reading Railway Company, or the new Reading Coal
Company, and who shall qualify as purchasers of the same
by an affidavit like -the one already mentioned. It appears that this provision of the decree has already been
carried out because not appealed from, and that the stock
of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company has been sold, though
there is pending an application to set the sale aside.
The appeals in this case were taken by the Insurance
Companies, who own 8,400 shares of the common stock of
the Reading Company, less than one per cent. of the entire
common stock, and by the so-called Prosser Committee,
also interveners, who represent 407,728 shares of the
common stock, which is somewhat less than 30 per cent. of
the total common stock, and less than 15 per cent. of the
entire capital stock of the Company. Their appeals are
based on the claim that the right to subscribe for the certificates of interest in the stock of the new Coal Company
belong to the common stockholders of the Reading Company and to them alone, to the exclusion of the preferred
stockholders.
After the first argument of these appeals, the court directed a second argument upon the questions (1) whether
the plan adopted by the District Court was in conformity
with this court's mandate, in establishing the entire independence of the companies found in unlawful combination
from each other, (2) whether there was any legal or practical difficulty in selling the Reading Coal Company's
stock free from the lien of the general mortgage, and (3)
what was the basis of the adjustment of the indebtedness
between the Reading Company and the new and old Reading Coal Companies. [257 U. S. 622.]

259 U. S.

the District Court would be limited to the assignments of
error of the appellants, but in this case, as the decree which
is before us was entered under a mandate of this court, we
have jurisdiction to consider on our own motion whether
our mandate has been complied with. We delegated to
the District Court the duty of formulating a decree in
compliance with the principles announced in our judgment
of reversal, and that gives us plenary power where the
compliance has been attempted and the decree in any
proper way is brought to our attention to see that it follows our opinion.
The plan of dissolution of the bond between the four
companies under the control of the holding company is,
shortly, as follows:
1. It merges the Reading Railway Company in the
Reading Company and shears the latter of corporate capacity to do other than a railroad business.
2. It turns over to trustees of the court for sale or
disposition in accord with the plan of groupings by the
Interstate Commerce Commission to be adopted under the
Transportation Act the majority stock of the New Jersey
Railroad Company.
3. It separates the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company from
the New Jersey Railroad Company by directing the sale
of that stock to persons who do not own stock in any of
the other companies.
4. It separates the Reading Company from the Reading
Coal Company by a transfer of all the stock in the latter
company to a new coal company to be organized by trustees of the court, and directs a distribution to the stockholders of the Reading Company, in proportion to their
respective holdings of stock in the latter company, of
valuable rights, evidenced by so-called certificates of interest, to dispose of the stock in the new Coal Company.
The effect of the decree is to require them either to sell
these certificates to others not stockholders in the Read-

Opinion of the Court.

ing Company, or to sell their stock in the Reading Company before themselves becoming stockholders in the new
Coal Company, or doing neither, and receiving no interest
in the interval to let the court sell the new stock after
July 1, 1924, for their account.
The difficulty in the separation of the interests of the
Reading Company and the Reading Coal Company is that
the lien of the general mortgage covers much of the property of the Reading Company and all of the stock and
property of the Coal Company and is not redeemable
until 1997. The plan requires the Reading Company to
assume the whole liability of the general mortgage and
to save the old and new Coal Companies harmless therefrom in consideration of $10,000,000 cash or current assets
and $25,000,000 in bonds secured by mortgage on all its
property by the Reading Coal Company, redeemable at
the same time as the general mortgage. This is on the
assumption in which all agree that the respective liabilities of the Reading Company and the Coal Company
under the lien of thq mortgage as between themselves
should be regarded as something less than three to one.
The doubt whether the plan is adequate to secure the
object of this court has been prompted by the failure to
take out from under the lien of the general mortgage the
capital stock and the properties of the Reading Coal Company and the giving of a new mortgage by the Reading
Coal Company on all its property to secure bonds to be
delivered by it to the Reading Company. The query is
whether this would not leave in the Reading Company
some possible measure of future control over the Coal
Company and enable the Reading Company later on to
re~stablish in effect the combination which, this court
decided, must be ended.
It is further questioned whether the interest which the
new Coal Company, with its properties still subject to the
lien of the general mortgage, will have in preserving the

168

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

259 U. S.

solvency of the Reading Company, would not create a
constant motive on its part to favor the Reading Company with its tonnage and discriminate against other
carriers reaching its mines. It is pointed out, too, that
the interest of the Reading Company in the continuing
ability of the Coal Company to avoid default on its proposed mortgage for $25,000,000 to secure bonds to be
given to the Reading Company, would prompt a community of operation between the two companies which
it was the object of this court to end.
All these difficulties, it is said, could be removed if all
of the properties and stock of the Coal Company were
sold outright and the purchase money applied to the satisfaction pro tanto of the general mortgage by depositing
with the trustee cash or current securities equal to onethird of the amount of the general mortgage debt, as the
fair ratio of the Coal Company's contribution to the security of that company, the remainder of the proceeds of
sale to go to the Reading Company for its proper disposition as assets of its own.
When the mandate went down, the District Court invited the Reading Company to propose a plan for the dissolution of the illegal combination for submission to all the
parties in interest, including, of course, the Government.
The first form of plan contemplated that the release of
the stock and properties of the Reading Coal Company
from the lien of the general mortgage should be secured by
the Reading Company's paying to each bondholder, in
consideration of his release, a cash premium of ten per
cent. of the par value of the bonds he held. This did not
meet with the favor of the bondholders or of their trustee.
The common stockholders of the Reading Company also
objected. The Solicitor General in his discussion of the
plan put the case thus:
"The Attorney General, therefore, was confronted with
these alternatives: (1) To insist upon the court ordering

CONTINENTAL CO. v. UNITED STATES.
156.

169

Opinion of the Court.

the release of the stock and properties of the Reading Coal
Company from the lien of the general mortgage without
the consent and over the protest of the trustee and the
bondholders; or (2) To assent to a modification of the
plan which, while placing in different hands the stock control of the Reading Company and the Reading Coal Company and providing effective safeguards against future
inter-corporate relations, would leave the stock and properties of the latter pledged under the general mortgage.
"The following considerations appeared to make the
latter course the wiser as well as the more expedient:
"(1) The attitude of the trustee and bondholders made
it clear that the former course would meet with an opposition which certainly would have resulted in another
appeal to this court with consequent delay in effecting
a dissolution."
The fourth reason was stated as follows:
"(4) Finally, and most important, the country at that
time was in the midst of a serious financial and industrial
depression accompanying the transition from the artificial
stimulations of war to normal conditions of peace. The
condition was regarded as critical. Grave apprehension
was felt that if the Government should insist upon the disruption of the general mortgage public confidence in the
restoration of prosperity might be adversely affected. It
seemed the course of wisdom, therefore, to avoid the possibility of contributing further to an already threatening
situation if it could be done without sacrifice to the effectiveness of the dissolution. The Government was not
averse to any necessary surgery, but it seemed wise not
to amputate any more than was necessary to secure the
great policy of the Sherman law. In this it followed the
admonition of this court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco
Cases that innocent interests, as the present holders of the
bonds in question were, should be spared unnecessary
injury."

170

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

259 11. S.

It is asserted further by the Reading Company, and
not denied, that, when this decree was entered by the
District Court, the monetary situation was such that it
would have been impossible to secure a purchaser of the
Reading Coal Company properties at any fair price, that
indeed the transaction could not have been financed at all.
The considerations influencing the District Court and
the Government against a drastic readjustment of the
interests of the bondholders under the general mortgage
and the holdings of the two offending companies were of
manifest weight in the then business and monetary situation. Even now this court would hesitate to order a
sale of this kind of property worth probably one hundred
million dollars with confident hope of realizing an adequate amount with the necessary restrictions as to the
purchaser. We agree with the Attorney General in his
disinclination to insist upon such a sale under the circumstances. Since the time of settling the decree, however, a
change for the better has come in the financial situation.
We think that this justifies us now in making some,
modifications in the plan which were not presented to the
parties or considered by the court, possibly because they
might have been unwise in the critical conditions then existing. They involve a departure from the contract provisions of the general mortgage and the bonds it secures.
The petition of the trustee under the general mortgage
urges that a court of equity ought not by its decree, summarily to wrench the Coal Company's property from
under the pledge of the mortgage, or to vary its terms in
view of the circumstances. It points out that neither
the trustee nor the bondholders were made parties to the
original bill to set aside the combination and monopoly,
and that the trustee was made a party to the proceeding
only after the mandate of this court went down. The
petition avers the innocence of any wrongdoing on the
part of the bondholders, and alleges that, of the $106,-

CONTINENTAL CO. v. UNITED STATES.
156.

171

Opinion of the Court.

000,000 of bonds issued, $50,000,000 were issued at or
about the date of the mortgage in 1896, $36,000,000 were
issued between 1897 and 1920 to take up and in exchange
for underlying bonds that were liens prior to reorganization and for the most part prior to the passage of the
Sherman Act, and $20,000,000 were issued between 1898
and 1911 for betterments. It further alleges that for
twenty years after this mortgage was executed, its validity, as far as the bondholders are concerned, has not been
questioned by the Government and these bonds have
passed into the hands of numerous and widely scattered
holders, that few of them, if any, are or were identified at
all with the management of the Reading Company or
Coal Company, and many of the bonds are held by
fiduciaries.
The power of the court under the Sherman Anti-Trust
Law to disregard the letter and legal effect of the bonds
and general mortgage under the circumstances of this
case, in order to achieve the purpose of the law, we can
not question. The principles laid down and followed in
the case of United States v. Southern Pacific Co., decided
today, post, 214, leave no doubt upon this point. Indeed,
the case which we there cite, Philadelphia,Baltimore &
Washington R. R. Co. v. Schubert, 224 U. S. 603, 613, 614,
is a stronger instance of the power of Congress in regulating interstate commerce to disregard contracts than is
needed in this case, because there it was enforced as to a
contract made before the regulation. It may be conceded, as averred, that the bondholders in this case were
innocent of any actual sense of wrongdoing, that they
relied on the advice of eminent counsel in assuming that
the union of the Railroad and the Coal Companies under
the control of the holding company was not a violation
of the Sherman Law, and that some of them surrendered
bonds secured by underlying liens of unquestioned valid-

ity created before the enactment of the Sherman Law.
Nevertheless, spread all over the face of the general mortgage, was the information and notice of the union of the
railway and coal properties for the very purpose which
is the head and front of the offending under the AntiTrust Law and which requires this court to dissolve the
illegal combination. The general mortgage was the indispensable instrument of the unlawful conspiracy to
restrain interstate commerce. It was the advantage of
the legally improper relation between the railway and
coal interests which made the security so attractive. In
one of the phases of a case, reported as United States v.
Lake Shore & M. S. Ry. Co., 203 Fed. 295, the Court of
Appeals of the Sixth Circuit was obliged to consider on
an intervening petition, the question of the power of the
court under the Sherman Act to deal with a mortgage
whose lien if held to be inviolable interfered with the
effective dissolution of the offending combination of a
railway company and a coal company. The opinion is
not reported, but we have been furnished a certified copy
of the memorandum opinion and its language is so pertinent that we quote it as expressing our view:
"One who takes a mortgage upon several items of property of such character, that their common ownership or
operation may offend against the Anti-Trust Law or the
commodities clause, and such that the mortgage serves
practically to aid in tying them together, must be deemed
to hold his mortgage subject to the contingency that if the
complete and final separation of one item of the mortgaged property from the remainder becomes essential to
the due enforcement of either named law, the court
charged with such enforcement may take control of that
item, free it from the consolidating tendency of the mortgage, and substitute therefor its judicially ascertained
equivalent. Otherwise the mortgage will stand as the
ready means of restoring-or at least tending to restore-

those conditions which the court is endeavoring to destroy.
It may well be true that a railroad and a coal company
under common ownership and management are worth
more as security under a mortgage than when independent, and that their effective separation does impair the
mortgage security, but this can not make the law helpless."
We have no desire to vary the security of the bondholders more than seems necessary to effect fully the purpose of the law, and wish to recognize their equities as
against the two companies and the stockholders, as will
later appear.
We think that the plan should be changed in accord
with the following suggestions. The District Court
should, after a hearing of all interested parties, determine
the respective values of the properties of the merged
Reading Company and the Coal Company which are subject to lien of the general mortgage. Then the decree
should direct that the liability of each on the bonds and
the pledge under the mortgage shall be modified as between the mortgagee and the mortgagors, so that the liability of the Reading Company on the bonds outstanding,
and the lien of the mortgage upon that company's property to secure them, shall be reduced to an amount proportionate to the ratio of the value of its pledged property to
the value of all the property pledged including that of the
Coal Company. The obligation of the Coal Company
upon such bonds and the lien upon its property to secure
them should be reduced in corresponding proportion. The
amount that each company is to pay as interest should be
similarly fixed, and specific provisions for foreclosure of
these separate liens on default and requisite machinery
and other necessary changes to carry out the result will
be made by the District Court in its discretion. By this
arrangement the interests and joint obligations of the
Reading Company and the Coal Company will be completely severed and the purpose of this court carried out.

174

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

259 U. S.

The Reading Company's first plan contemplated the
securing of a voluntary release of the Coal Company's
property by the bondholders through payment of ten per
cent. of the par value of his bonds to each bondholder;
but the proposal did not meet with favor. We leave it to
the District Court to determine what, if any, injury to the
security this modification of the terms of the debt and
mortgage may cause and to compensate for it by such a
payment to the bondholders by either or both companies
as may seem equitable and convenient.
The changes involved in these suggestions may interfere with, or make inapplicable, the provisions of the
present plan looking to a proper working capital for the
Reading Company. Authority is therefore given to the
District Court to amend the plan in any way which seems
wise to leave the Reading Company properly financed to
meet its obligations to the public.
It does not seem necessary to change the general form of
that feature of the plan by which, through the distribution
of certificates of interest to the stockholders of the old
Reading Company in the stock of the new Coal Company,
the-stock relations of the old Reading Company and the
present Coal Company are to be ended, though we would
not limit the power of the District Court in this regard.
It may be found necessary to increase the price of two
dollars per share in the Reading Company which the recipients of the certificates of interest in the stock of the
new Coal Company are to pay therefor, in order to reserve
more cash to the Reading Company in that transaction;
but this the District Court can determine. The adopted
plan was nicely adjusted to secure a practical working
basis for both companies, and we would not embarrass the
District Court, after a full hearing of all the parties, in
the detailed changes which it may find practically necessary to adopt in following the general outlines of our -nodification of the plan.

CONTINENTAL CO. v. UNITED STATES.

175

Opinion of the Court.

We think it not unreasonable to accept the suggestion
made at the bar, namely, that not only shall the stockholders of the Coal Company upon receiving and registering their stock be required to make affidavit that they have"
no stock ownership in the Reading Company and are not
acting for, or representing, anyone who has, but also that
the merged Reading Company shall be required to adopt
a by-law effective till the further order of the court permitting registration of transfers of shares of its capital
stock in the names only of persons who shall make affidavit that they are not stockholders, registered or actual
in either the new or the old Coal Company, and have not
been and are not holders of proxies to vote shares of stock
therein.
As to the New Jersey Railroad Company and the
Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, we have heard no criticism
and the provisions as to them are approved. By the decree, the new Coal Company, its officers and directors are
enjoined from voting the Coal Company stock so as to
form a combination between the Coal Company and the
Reading Company. The Reading Company and all persons acting for or in its interest are perpetually enjoined
from acquiring, receiving, holding, voting, or in any manner acting as the owner of any shares of the new Coal
Company; and the new Coal Company and all persons
acting for it are enjoined from acquiring, or voting, any
of the shares of the Reading Company. The Coal Company will be permanently enjoined from issuing to the
Reading Company, and the Reading Company from receiving, any stock, bonds, or other evidences of corporate
indebtedness of the Coal Company. On default the trustee of the mortgage is required to vote the Coal Company
stock so as not to bring about a recurrence of the conditions condemned in this cause, and if it shall be necessary
to sell the properties they are to be sold to different interests. The Attorney General and his successors in office

259"U. S.

are given by the decree full opportunity to keep a watch
upon the relations between the two companies and to
appeal to the court for prompt enforcement of the injunctions of the decree as they may be advised. The court
retains large control of the decree with power to assure its
continued efficacy by the summary remedy of contempt.
With these restrictive provisions and the modifications of
the plan outlined above, we think that the independence
of the four companies will be fully achieved.
We come now to the issue upon which these appeals
were brought here. It concerns the respective rights of
the common stockholders and the preferred stockholders
in the assets of the Reading Company. They all, under
the plan, will receive the benefit of the difference between
the real value of the privilege of disposing of their distributive certificates of interest in stock in the new Coal
Company, and the payment of $2.00 or such other sum as
may be fixed, per share held by them of the Reading Company stock. Such difference has already been the subject
of sale and quotation on the market in New York and has
varied from $11 to $20. This might have been expected
in view of the disparity between par of the capital stock
of the Reading Coal Company and the far greater actual
value of its properties. The disparity shows that while
the transfer of certificates of interest in the new Coal Company stock is denominated a sale, it is only a distribution
of the surplus or assets of the Reading Company to its
stockholders made necessary by the decree of this court in
taking the Reading Company out of the coal lbusiness and
restricting it to that of owning and operating a railroad
system. The Reading Company by merger with the Reading Railway Company is made to change its character.
Under the plan it must comply with the Act of May 3,
1909, Penn. Laws, 408, by which, in merging with the
Reading Railroad Company, it becomes a new corporation.

What is to be done is in fact and law a liquidation of the
assets of the old Reading Company. Its stockholders receive their distribution in kind by retention of the stock
they held in the old Reading Company as stock in the reduced new Reading Company, purged of its offense against
the law, together with the distributive values of that
which the old Reading Company has been compelled to
get rid of, i. e., the ownership of the stock of the Coal
Company. The distribution of certificates of interest in
the new Coal Company shares was evidently given the
form of a sale to enable the new Reading Company to realize out of it $5,600,000 in cash to give it additional working capital enough properly to operate the Reading Railway System. But this does not change its real nature as
a mere distribution of forbidden assets in kind to stockholders.
The rights of the common and preferred stockholders
of the Reading Company inter sese are to be determined
by the organization agreement of 1896. At that time,
under a special charter of a corporation known as the Excelsior Enterprise Company granted by the Pennsylvania
Legislature in 1871, the Reading Company, by change of
name, came into being. The capital stock was increased
to $140,000,000 divided into 2,800,000 shares of the par
value of $50 each. Half of these were preferred, $28,000,000 first preferred, and $42,000,000 second preferred. The
other half or $70,000,000 were common, and the rights of
the preferred and common stock were fixed by agreement.
Each share of stock, whether common or preferred, had a
vote. The agreement provided that the preferred stock
should be entitled to non-cumulative dividends "at the

178

259 U. S.

rate of, but not exceeding, four per cent per annum, in
each and every fiscal year, in preference and priority to
any payment in or for such fiscal year, of any dividend
on other stock; but only from undivided net profits of
the Company when and as determined by the Board of
Directors, and only if and when the Board shall declare
dividends therefrom. If, after providing for the payment
of full dividends for any fiscal year on the First Preferred
Stock, there shall remain any surplus undivided net
profits, the Board out of such surplus may declare and pay
dividends for such year upon the Second Preferred Stock.
If, from the business of any particular fiscal year, excluding undivided net profits remaining from previous years,
after providing out of the net profits of such particular
fiscal year for the payment of the full dividends for such
fiscal year on the First and Second Preferred Stock, there
shall remain surplus net profits, the Board of Directors
may declare, and out of such surplus net profits of such
yeaf may pay, dividends upon any other stock of the Company. But no dividends shall in any year be paid upon
any such other stock out of net profits of any previous
fiscal year in which the full dividends shall not have been
paid on the First and Second Preferred Stock."
The company was given the right at any time to redeem
either or both classes of its preferred stock at par in cash,
if such redemption should then be allowed by law and
after payment of dividends of 4 per cent. for two successive years on the first preferred stock, to convert the second preferred stock not exceeding 42,000,000, par value,
one-half into first preferred stock, and one-half into common stock, and to increase its first preferred and common
stock to the extent necessary to effect such conversion.
The company never exercised the right to convert or redeem the preferred stock.
It will be observed that the preferred stock and the
common stock with 1,400,000 shares of each were thus

CONTINENTAL CO. v. UNITED STATES.
156.

179

Opinion of the Court.

given an equality of voting power which could not be
changed without the consent of the company, and that
it has not been changed either by conversion or redemption. This would seem to have been designed to preserve
an equilibrium of control in which reasonable- dividends
out of profits when they accrued in sufficient amount
would be voted to the common stockholders on the one
hand, and proper additions would be made out of earnings
to the capital of the company to increase its future profitearning capacity and create a greater security for a constant payment of dividends to preferred stockholders. Of
course there would not be block voting of the two classes
of stock but the division did tend to secure a fair representation of both interests in the board of directors.
The effect of the agreement as to dividends upon the
preferred and common stock seems to us clear. It emphasizes that dividends are to be paid only out of undivided profits and when and as determined by-the board of
directors and only if and when the board shall declare
them. It leaves to the board to determine in its discretion
whether the undivided profits shall be put in surplus working capital or in dividends. The limitations on the discretion of the board are that the first and second preferred
can not receive more than four per cent. in any fiscal
year, and that neither the second preferred nor the common stock can receive any dividend until the first preferred dividend has been paid in full each year and the
common stock receives nothing until the second preferred
dividend is thus paid. The words describing the condition
upon which the power of the board to declare dividends
on the common stock can be exercised, show that each
year's profits are to be considered by themselves in the
distribution of dividends between the stock. Appellants, however, rely on the final words of the
clause to show that it is intended that net profits in any
past year can be thereafter allowed to the common stock

180

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Opinion of the Court.

259 U. S.

if in that past year the preferred stock had been paid
full dividends. We do not find it necessary to decide
that the board of directors has not such power; but if
so, the power is not one the exercise of which can be compelled in the absence of fraud or breach of trust. The
failure of the board to exercise it, and the application of
the earnings to surplus determine such earnings to be
assets as of the time of the compulsory winding up and
liquidation of the corporation. The power to declare
dividends not exercised can have no more effect upon the
rights of the preferred stockholders to share in the existing assets of the corporation when liquidated than the
failure of the company to convert preferred stock into
common, or to redeem the preferred stock at par. The
proper interpretation of the agreement is that, after the
declaration of dividends for any current year, the undivided earnings are to be regarded as capital assets and
to be distributed on liquidation, unless the board of
directors has meantime applied them as dividends. If
the argument of appellants were carried to its logical
result, all the net earnings of the Reading Company in
twenty-five years no matter how invested or applied to
increasing the earning capital, must in a liquidation be
treated as undistributed profits to go entirely to the common stock without any action of the board of directors.
This is impossible.
The record discloses that in 1904, when the Reading
Company made its application to the New York Stock
Exchange to have its stock listed, it contained the following statement:
"The Preferred and Common stocks have equal voting
power and in liquidation or dissolution of the corporation
will share equally in pro rata distribution of assets."
Coming as this must have come from the representatives of both the preferred and common stockholders, it
is significant evidence of what they then thought of their

respective rights and has the additional weight of a representation to future purchasers of the two classes of stock
as to the kind of interests they were buying in the company.
Our conclusion that the claim on behalf of the common
stockholders is invalid is based on the construction of the
words of the agreement itself and hardly needs authority
to sustain it. It is, however, in accord with the general
common-law rule that stockholders common and preferred share alike in the assets of a liquidating corporation, if the preference is only as to dividends. Hamlin v.
