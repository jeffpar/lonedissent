UNITED STATES v. CRESS.

UNITED STATES v. KELLY ET AL.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.

Nos. 84, 718. Argued December 13, 1916.-Decided March 12, 1917.
The servitude to the interests of navigation of privately owned lands
forming the banks and bed of a stream is a natural servitude, confined to such streams as in their ordinary and natural condition are
susceptible of valuable public use in navigation, and confined to the
natural condition of such streams.
When navigable streams affording ways of commerce between States
are improved by the federal government by means of locks and dams
which raise the water above its natural level, the streams as thus improved remain navigable waters of the United States for all purposes
of federal jurisdiction ana regulation.
The power of the federal government to improve navigable streams in
the interest of interstate and foreign commerce must be exercised,
when private property is taken, in subordination to the Fifth Amendment.
In improving the navigation of the Cumberland River, in Kentucky,
under the commerce power, the federal government by means of a
lock and dam raised the water above the natural level so that lands
on a non-navigable tributary, not normally invaded thereby, were
subjected permanently to periodical overflows substantially injuring,
though not destroying, their value. Held, in an action for damages
under § 24 of the Judicial Code (derived from the Tucker Act):
(1) That this amounted to a partial taking of the property.
(2) That the United States was liable ex contractu to compensate the
owner to the extent of the injury.
(3) That, upon payment, the Utkited States would acquire an easement to overflow the land as often as would necessarily result from the
use of the lock and dam for navigation, the fee, however, remaining
in the private owner.
(4) That the riparian owner also Was entitled to compensation for.impairment of the value of his land caused by the destruction of a

ford over the tributary used in connection with a private way appurtenant to the land.
A like improvement of the Kentucky River, in Kentucky, by raising
its water above natural level raised in like manner the water in a
non-navigable tributary on which were a privately owned mill and
mill-site, thus ending the usefulness of the~mill by doing away with
the head of water necessary to run it. Held, that the mill-owner, to
whom also, under the law of Kentucky, belonged the bed of the
tributary with the right to have the water flow there free from artificial obstruction, was entitled ex contractu to recover from the United
States an amount equal to the depreciation of the mill property
resulting from the loss of water-power.
The right to have the water of a non-navigable stream flow away from
riparian land without artificial obstruction is not a mere easement
or appurtenance, but exists by the law of nature as an inseparable
part of the land itself.
Section 152 of the Judicial Code, permitting costs against the United
States in claims cases, although appearing in the chapter entitled
"The Court of Claims," is not confined to cases in that court but
applies also when the District Court is exercising concurrent jurisdiction under § 24. This conclusion results from a consideration
of the Tucker Act, of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, and §§ 294
and 295 of the Code, read in connection with the repealing section, 297.

the 20th paragraph of § 24, Jud. Code (Act of March 3,
1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1093), to recover compensation
for the taking of lands and water rights by means of backwater resulting from the construction and maintenance
by the Government of certain locks and dams upon the
Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers, respectively, in the
State of Kentucky, in aid of the navigation upon those
rivers.
In No. 84 the findings of the District Court are, in substance, that at the time of the erection of Lock and Dam
No. 21 in the Cumberland River, the plaintiff was the
owner of 189 acres of land on Whiteoak Creek, a tributary
of the Cumberland, not far distant from the river; that
by reason of the erection of the lock and dam six and six.tenths acres of this land are subject to frequent overflows
of water from the river, so as to depreciate it one-half of
its value, and a ford across Whiteoak Creek and a part
of a pass-way are destroyed; that the six and six-tenths
acres were worth $990, and the damage thereto was $495;
that the damage to the land by the destruction of the ford
was $500; and that plaintiff was entitled to recover the
sum of $995. It may be supposed that Whiteoak Creek
was not a navigable stream, but there is no finding on the
subject.
In No. 718 the findings are to the effect that at the time
of the erection by the Government of Lock and Dam
No. 12 in the Kentucky River the plaintiffs, together with
-another person who was joined as a defendant, were the
owners and in possession of a tract of land situate on
Miller's Creek, a branch of the Kentucky, containing five
and one-half acres, upon which there were a mill and a mill
seat; that by reason of the erection of the lock and dam
the mill no longer can be driven by water power; that the
water above the lock and dam, when it is at pool stage,
is about one foot-below the crest of the mill dam, and this
prevents the drop in the current that is necessary to run

Opinion of the Court.

the mill; that no part of the land or mill is overflowed or
covered by pool stage of water, nor is the mill physically
damaged thereby; that Miller's Creek is not a navigable
stream; that the damages sustained by the owners of the
mill, representing depreciation of the value of the mill
property by. cutting off the water power, amount to $1500.
Judgments were entered in favor of the respective land
owners for the sums mentioned in the findings, together
with interest and the costs of the suits, and the United
States appealed to this court.
(1.) A fundamental contention made in behalf of the
Government, and one that applies to both cases, is that
the control by Congress, and the Secretary of War acting
for it, over the navigation of the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers, must also include control of their tributaries,
and. that in order to improve navigation at the places
mentioned in the. findings it was necessary to erect dams
and back up the water, and the right to do this must include also the right to raise the -water in the tributary
streams.
In passing upon this contention we may assume, without however deciding, that the rights of defendants in
error are no greater than if they had been riparian owners
upon the rivers, instead of upon the tributary creeks.
The States have authority to establish for themselves
such rules of property as they may deem expedient with
respect to the streams of water within their borders both
navigable and non-navigable, and the ownership of the
lands forming their beds and banks (Barney v. Keokuk,
94 U. S. 324, 338; Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 671;
Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S. 371, 382; Shively v. Bowlby,
152 U. S. 1, 40, 58; St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v.
St. Paul Water Commissioners, 168 U. S. 349, 358), subject,
however, in the case of navigable streams, to the paramount authority of Congress to control the navigation so
far as may be necessary for the regulation of commerce

among the States and with foreign nations (Shively v.
Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 40; Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S.
269, 272; Scott v. Lattig, 227 U. S. 229, 243); the exercise
of this authority being subject, in its turn, to the inhibition
of the Fifth Amendment against the taking of private
property for public use without just compensation (Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312,
336; United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 465, 471).
The State of Kentucky, like most of the States of the
Union, determines the navigability of her streams, so far
as the public right is concerned, not by the common-law
test of the ebb and flow of the tide-manifestly inapplicable in a State so wholly remote from*the sea-but by
the test of navigability in fact (Thurman v. Morrison, 53
Kentucky, [14 B. Mon.] 367 [2d ed. p. 296]; Morrison v.
Thurman, 56 Kentucky, [17 B. Mon.] 249; Goodin's Executors v. Kentucky Lumber Co., 90 Kentucky, 625; Murray
v. Preston, 106 Kentucky, 561, 564; Banks v. Frazier, 111
Kentucky, 909, 912; Ireland v. Bowman & Cockrell, 130
Kentucky, 153, 161), while sustaining private ownership of
the beds of her streams, both navigable and non-navigable,
according to the common-law rule (Berry v. Snyder, 66
Kentucky, [3 Bush] 266, 273, 277; Miller v. Hepburn, 71
Kentucky, [8 Bush] 326, 331; Williamsburg Boom Co. v.
Smith, 84 Kentucky, 372, 374; Wilson v. Watson, 141 Kentucky, 324, 327; Robinson v. Wells, 142 Kentucky, 800,
804), with incidental rights to the flow of the stream in its
natural state (Anderson v. CincinnatiSouthern Railway, 86
Kentucky, 44, 48).
The general rule that private ownership of property in
the beds and waters of navigable streams is subject to
the exercise of the public right of navigation, and the
governmental control and regulation necessary to give
effect to that right, is so fully established, and is so amply
illustrated by recent decisions of this court, that a mere
reference to the cases will suffice. Scranton v. Wheeler,

v. Garrison, 237 U. S. 251, 268; Willink v. United States,
240 U. S. 572, 580.
But this rule, like every other, has its limits, and in the
present cases, which require us to ascertain the dividing
line between public and private right, it is important to
inquire what are "navigable streams" within the meaning
of the rule.
In Kentucky, and in other States that have rejected
the common-law test of tidal flow and adopted the test of
navigability in fact, while recognizing private ownership
of the beds of navigable streams, numerous cases have
arisen where it has been necessary to draw the line between public and private right in waters alleged to be
navigable; and by an unbroken current of authorities it
has become well established that the test of navigability
in fact is to be applied to the stream in its natural condition, not as artificially raised by dams or similar structures;
that the public right is to be measured by the capacity
of the stream for valuable public use in its natural condition; that riparian owners have a right to the enjoyment of
the natural flow without burden or hindrance imposed by
artificial means, and no public easement beyond the
natural one can arise without grant or dedication save by
condemnation with appropriate compensation for the
private right. Cases exemplifying these propositions are'
cited in a marginal note.' We have found no case to the

contrary. An apparent but not a real exception is the

rested (pp. 609, 612, 624) upon the:ground that the bed

UNITED STATES v. CRESS.
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

That the test of navigability in fact should be applied to
streams in their natural condition was in effect held in
The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, a case which turned upon
the question whether Grand River, in the State of Michigan, was one of the " navigable waters of the United States"
within the meaning of acts of Congress that regulated
vessels carrying merchandise and passengers upon such
waters. Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, after
showing that the tidal test was not applicable in this country, said (p. 563): "A different test must, therefore, be
applied to determine the navigability of our rivers, and
that is found in their navigable capacity. Those rivers
must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which
are navigable in fact. And they are navigable in fact when
they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their
ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which
trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water." The point
was set forth more clearly in The Montello, 20 Wall. 430,
where the question was whether Fox River, in the State
of Wisconsin, was a navigable water of the United States
within the meaning of the acts of Congress. There were
rapids and falls in the river, but the obstructions caused
by them had been removed by artificial means so as to
furnish uninterrupted water communication for steam
vessels of considerable capacity. It was argued (p. 440)
that although the river might now be considered a highway for commerce conducted in the ordinary modes, it
was not so in its natural state, and therefore was not
navigable 'water of the United States within the purview
of The.Daniel Ball decision. The court, accepting navigability in the natural state of the river as the proper test, proceeded to show that, even before the improvements
resulting in an unbroken navigation were undertaken, a
large and successful interstate commerce had been carried on through this river by means of Durham boats,

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Opinion of the Court.

243 U. S.

which were vessels from 70 to 100 feet in length, with 12
feet beam, and drawing when loaded from 2 to 212 feet
of water. The court, by Mr. Justice Davis, declared
(p. 441) that it would be a narrow rule to hold that, in
this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated
by steam or sail vessels it could not be treated as a public
highway. "The capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true
criterion of the navigability of a river, rather than the
extent and manner of that use. If it be capable in its
natural state of being used for purposes of commerce, no
matter in what mode the commerce may be conducted,
it is navigable in fact, and becomes in law a public river
or highway." And again (p. 443): "There are but few
of our fresh-water rivers which did not originally present
serious obstructions to an uninterrupted navigation. In
some cases, like the Fox River, they -maybe so great while
they last as to prevent the use of the best instrumentalities for carrying on commerce, but the vital and essential
point is whether the natural navigation of the river is such
that it affords a channel for useful commerce. If this be
so the river is navigable in fact, although its navigation
may be encompassed with difficulties by reason of
natural barriers, such as rapids and sand-bars." Numerous decisions of state courts were cited as supporting this view, including some of those to which we have
referred.
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Company, 13 Wall. 166, involved
the right to compensation for land overflowed with backwater from a dam erected and maintained in the Fox
River, under authority of the State of Wisconsin, for the
improvement of navigation. (A permissible exercise
of state power, in the absence of action by Congress, although it was an interstate navigable water; Willson v.
Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245, 251; Gilman v.
Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713.) The raising of the river above

UNITED STATES v. CRESS.
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

its natural stage, by means of an artificial structure, was
the gravamen of the complaint. It was argued (p. 174)
that the State might, in the interest of the public, "erect
such works as may be deemed expedient for the purpose
of improving the navigation and increasing usefulness of a
navigable river, without rendering itself liable to individuals owning land bordering on such river, for injuries to
their lands resulting from their overflow by reason of such
improvements." This court overruled the contention,
and held there was a taking without compensation contrary to the applicable provision of the constitution of
Wisconsin.
In United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, the same principle was applied in the case of an operation by the Government of the United States. For the improvement of
the navigation of the Savannah River certain dams and
other obstructions were placed and maintained in its bed,
with the result of raising the water above its natural height
and backing it up against plaintiffs' embankment upon the
river and interfering with the drainage of their plantation. This was held (pp. 465, 471) to be a taking of private property, requiring compensation under the Fifth
Amendment, notwithstanding the work was done by the
Government in improving the navigation of a navigable
river. The raising of the water above its natural level was
held to be an invasion of the private property thereby
flowed.
In several other cases, the limitation of the public right
to the natural state of the stream has been recognized.
Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 667; United States v. Rio
Grande Dam & IrrigationCo., 174 U. S. 690, 698; Leovy
v. United States, 177 U. S. 621, 631.
It follows from what we have said that the servitude of
privately-owned lands forming the banks and bed of a
stream to the interests of navigation is a natural servitude,
confined to such streams as in their ordinary and natural

OCTOBER TERM, 1016.

condition are navigable in fact, and confined to the natural
condition of the stream. And, assuming that riparian,
owners upon non-navigable tributaries of navigable
streams are subject to such inconveniences as may arise
from the exercise of the common right of navigation, this
in like manner must be limited to the natural right. The
findings make it clear that the dams in question, constructed by the Government in the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers, respectively, are for raising the level of
those streams along certain stretches by means of backwater, so as to render them, to the extent of the raising,
artificial canals instead of natural waterways. In the
language of engineering, the Government has "canalized"
-the rivers. We intimate no doubt of the power of the
United States to carry out this kind of improvement.
Nor do we doubt that, upon the completion of the improvements, these rivers: the Cumberland because it is an
avenue of communication between two States; the Kentucky and also the Cumberland because in connection with
the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers they furnish highways
of commerce among many States (Gilman v. Philadelphia,
3 Wall. 713, 725; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563;
South Carolinav. Georgia, 93 U. S. 4, 10); remained navigable waters of the United States for all purposes of federal jurisdiction and regulation, notwithstanding the. artificial character of the improvements. Ex parte Boyer,
109 U. S. 629, 632; The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S.
17,28.
But the authority to make such improvements is only
a branch of the power to regulate interstate and foreign
commerce, and, as already stated, this power, like others,
must be exercised, when private property is taken, in
subordination to the Fifth Amendment. Monongahela
Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 336; United
States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 465, 471. And we deem it
clear that so much of the properties of the respective

defendants in erior as was unaffected by the flow of the
rivers or their tributaries prior to the construction of the
locks and dams in question was private property, and not
subject to be overflowed, without compensation, in the
raising of the level of the rivers by means of artificial
dams.
These cases have no proper relation to cases such as
Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S. 269, where no water was
thrown back on claimant's land, and the damage was confined to an interference with the access thence to the
navigable portion of the river; Scranton v. Wheeler, 179
U. S. 141,153, which likewise had to dowith the interruption of access from riparian land to a navigable channel;
Bedford v. United States, 192 U. S. 217, 225, where the
damage to claimant's land resulted from operations con.
ducted by the Government six miles farther up the river;
Jackson v. United States, 230 U. S. 1, 23, where owners of
lands on the east bank of .the Mississippi claimed compensation as for a taking of their property by reason of
the effect of levees built on the west bank opposite their
lands as a part of a system of levees designed to prevent
crevasses, retain the water'in the river, and thus improve
the navigation. In each of these, there was no direct invasion of the lands of the claimants,. the damages were
altogether consequential, and the right to compensation
was denied on that ground.
(2.) It is contended, in No. 84, that the damage to
Cress' land by the overflow of six and six-tenths acres,
because it depreciated its value only to the extent of onehalf, does not measure up to a taking, but is only a "partial injury," for which the Government is not liable. The
findings, however, render it plain that this is not a case
of temporary flooding or of consequential injury but a
permanent condition, resulting from the erection of the
lock and dam, by which the land is "subject to frequent
overflows of water from the river." That overflowing

lands by permanent back-water is a direct invasion,
amounting to a taking, is settled by Pumpelly v. Green
Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177; United States v. Lynah, 188
U. S. 445, 468-470. It is true that in the Pumpelly Case
there was an almost complete destruction, and in the
Lynah Case a complete destruction, of the value of the
lands, while in the present case the value is impaired to
the extent of only one-half. But it is the character of the
invasion, not the amount of damage resulting from it,
so long as the damage is substantial, that determines the
question whether it is a taking. As the court said, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, in United States v. Lynah, 188
U. S. 445, 470: "Where the government by the construction of a dam or other public works so floods lands belonging to an individual as to substantially destroy their value
there is a taking within the scope of the Fifth Amendment.
While the government does not directly proceed to appropriate the title, yet it takes away the use and value; when
that is done it is of little consequence in whom the fee may
be vested. Of course, it results from this that the proceedfng must be regarded as an actual appropriation of the
land, including the possession, the right of possession and
the fee; and when the amount awarded as compensation
is paid the title, the fee, with whatever rights may attach
thereto-in this case those at least which belong to a
riparian proprietor-pass to the government and it becomes henceforth the owner." There is no difference of
kind, but only of degree, between a permanent condition
of continual overflow by back-water and a permanent
liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows;
and, on principle, the right to compensation must arise
in the one case as in the other. If any substantial enjoyment of the land still remains to the owner, it may be
treated as a partial instead of a total divesting of his property in the land. The taking by condemnation of an interest less than the fee is familiar in the law of eminent

UNITED STATES v. CRESS.
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

domain. Where formal proceedings are initiated by the
party condemning, it is usual and proper to specify the
precise interest taken, where less than the fee. But where,
as in this case, the property-owner resorts to the courts,
as he may, to recover compensation for what actually
has been taken, upon the principle that the Government
by the very act. of taking impliedly has promised to make
compensation because the dictates of justice and the terms
of the Fifth Amendment so require (United States v. Great
Falls Mfg. Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656; United States v. Lynah,
188 U. S. 445, 465), and it appears that less than the whole
has been taken and is to be paid for, such a right or interest
will be deemed to pass as is necessary fairly to effectuate
the purpose of the taking; and where, as in this case with
respect to the six and six-tenths acres, land is not constantly but only at intervals overflowed, the fee may be
permitted to remain in the owner, subject to an easement
in the United States to overflow it with water as often as
necessarily may result from the operation of the lock and
dam for purposes of navigation.
(3.) In No. 84 some question is made about the allowance for the damage to the land by the destruction of the
ford across Whiteoak Creek and the pass-way, but we
deem the objection unsubstantial. It is said there is
nothing to show how Cress acquired ownership of the
ford, and that it does not appear that he had a right to
pass over the adjoining land of one Brown. It seems to
us, however, that the findings, while meager, sufficiently
import that Cress had a right to a. private way and ford
as appurtenant to his land, and that the damage to the
land by the destruction of the ford was $500. This brings
the case squarely within United States v. Welch, 217 U. S.
333, 339, and United States v. Grizzard, 219 U. S. 180, 184,
185.

amount to a taking of land. But the findings, render it
plain that it had the necessary effect of raising the creek,
below the dam to such an extent as to destroy the power
of the mill dan that was essential to the value of the mill;
or, as the findings put it, "The water above the lock
and dam, when it is at pool stage, is about one foot below
the crest of the mill dam, which prevents the drop in the
current which is necessary to run the mill." Under the
law of Kentucky, ownership of the bed of the creek, subject only to the natural flow of the water, is recognized as
fully as ownership -of the mill itself. The right to have
the water flow away from the mill dam unobstructed,
except as in the course of nature, is not a mere easement
or appurtenance, but exists by the law of nature as an
inseparable part of the land. A destruction of this right
is. a taking of a part of the land. Gardner v. Village of

(5.) In both cases it is urged that there was error in
allowing costs against the Government. Section 24 (20)
of the Judicial Code, under which the suits were brought,
originated in the provisions of the so-called Tucker Act

UNITED STATES v. CRESS.
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, and the argument
of the Government is that while under § 15 of that act
costs were recoverable against the United States, in the
District Court as in the Court of Claims, yet that § 297,
Jud. Code, repealed all of the Tucker Act with the exception of §§ 4, 5, 6, 7, and, 10, which relate to matters
of procedure, and that there is no longer any authority of
law for allowing costs against the United States in suits
brought in the District court. ' The fact is that § 297,
Jud. Code, besides the clause repealing the Tucker Act
with the exceptions mentioned, contains in its final paragraph a repeal of "all other Acts and parts of Acts, in so
far as they are embraced within and superseded by this
Act." Now, not otily is the provision of § 2 of the Tucker
Act, conferring upon the District Courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Claims over certain dlaims
against the United States, carried into § 24 (20) of the
Code, but the provision of § 15 of the Tucker Act for the
allowance of costs against the Government is carried in
as § 152. It is true that § 24 (20) is a part of Chapter
2 of the Code, entitled "District Courts-Jurisdiction,"
while § 152 is a part of Chapter- 7, entitled "The Court
of Claims." But by §§ 294 and 295 it is declared and
enacted as follows: "Sec. 294. The provisions of this Act,
so far as they are substantially the same as existing statutes, shall be construed as continuations thereof, and not
as new enactments, and there shall be no implication ofa
change of intent by reason of a change of words in such
statute, unless such change of intent shall be clearly manifest. Sec. 295. The arrangement and classification of the
several sections of this Act have been made for the purpose of a more convenient and orderly arrangement of the
same, and therefore no inference or presumption of a
legislative construction is to be drawn by reason of
the chapter under which any particular section is
placed."

From this it is plain that § 152 of the Code applies to
suits in the District Courts, as well as to those in the Court
of Claims.

WILSON, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI, v. NEW ET
AL., RECEIVERS OF THE MISSOURI, OKLAHOMA & GULF RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

No. 797.

Argued January 8,9, 10, 1917.-Decided March 19, 1917.

The effect of the Act of September 3, 5, 1916, entitled "An Act to establish an eight-hour day for employees of carriers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, and for other purposes, ' c. 436, 39 Stat.
721, is not only to establish permanently an eight-hour standard
for work and wages as between the carriers and employees affected,
but also to fix a scale of minimum wages, to wit, the rate of wages
then existing, for the eight-hour day and proportionately for overtime, to be in force only during the limited period defined by the act.
Viewed as an act establishing an eight-hour day as the standard of
service by employees, the statute is clearly within the power of Congress under the commerce clause.
The power to establish an eight-hour day does not beget the power to
fix wages.
In an emergnncy arising from a nation-wide dispute over wages between railroad companies and their train operatives, in which a
general strike, commercial paralysis and grave loss and suffering
overhang the country because the disputants are unable to agree,
