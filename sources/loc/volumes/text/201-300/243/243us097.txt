to have been one of the relators, and which followed the
decision in State v. Grimm, 239 Missouri, 135.

manner impair or affect the provisions of any treaty concluded between the United States and any foreign nation." Held, that the
grant of the discount is confined to goods in American bottoms, and
the effect of the proviso is to respect the treaty privileges with which
such a grant would be in conflict, not by extending the grant to
goods borne in foreign vessels, but by suspending the grant entirely
while such privileges exist.

THE

case is stated in the opinion.

.The Solicitor General for the United States:
The legislative history of ยง IV, paragraph J, subsection 7, shows it to be the result of a vain effort to compose
differences between the House, which favored discriminating duties to American vessels, and the Senate, which
resisted a disturbance of existing treaties. It was the
purpose of the House to limit the discount to goods in
American vessels only, thus discriminating in their favor
against the ships of all other nations. The Senate was
equally determined to brook no disturbance of existing

treaties.

The conference committee vainly endeavored

to harmonize these divergent and wholly irreconcilable
purposes.

The subsection is void by reason of the irreconcilability
of its main clause and proviso; or at least is without present

force or effect. The discount cannot' be allowed to goods
in American vessels alone, because, so construed, the

subsection would abrogate, impair or affect the provisions
of existing treaties. If self-executing, the treaties would
be abrogated or impaired by such a grant. A treaty is
abrogated by a subsequent inconsistent statute. Rainey
v. United States, 232 U. S. 310; Taylor v. Morton, 2 Curtis,
454; Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190.
The treaties are, as a matter of fact, not self-executing
but executory; nevertheless, Congress did not design to
contravene them. Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 313.
Congress has evidenced its understanding that the treaties
are executory. Act March 1, 1816, 3 Stat. 255, c. 22;
Act December 17, 1903, 33 Stat. 3, c. 1; Crandall, Treaties,
their Making and Enforcement, p. 145; Willoughby on
Constitution, ยง 209. The decisions regard the treaties
as executory. Taylor v. Morton, supra; Whitney v. Robertson, supra.
The discount cannot be allowed to goods in both
American and treaty vessels. Such was manifestly not
the intent of Congress, nor is it- the legal consequence
of the words employed. The language of the act does not
support the construction suggested. The proviso was
not intended to enlarge the operation of the discount
clause, but, on the contrary, to restrict it. It is the usual
office of a proviso to "limit and restrict the operation of
the enacting clause." Minis v. United States, 15 Pet.

White v. United States, 191 U. S. 545, 551.
The discount is, pro tanto, an exemption from taxation.
Such exemptions are not to be raised or extended by implication. Central R. R. & Banking Co. v. Georgia, 92

bottoms alike would result in no substantial benefit to
the former but would be a virtual donation to shippers in
the latter and a wholly useless sacrifice of revenue. Results of allowance of discount to American and treaty
bottoms demonstrate that Congress did not intend such
construction. A discrimination against non-treaty ships
alone is not a discrimination in favor of American vessels.
There is evidence elsewhere in the act that Congress had
no thought of singling out for discrimination British and
French vessels in the indirect trade and ships of non-treaty
countries.
The discrimination, if directed solely against nontreaty vessels, could have been more clearly and effectively accomplished without sacrifice of revenue by modifying ยง IV, paragraph J, subsection 1, and adding five per
cent. to the discriminating duty of ten per cent. thereby
imposed. In order to make the discount clause presently
effective, a meaning should not be enforced which is repugnant to the main, revenue-producing portions of the
act. Van Dyke v. Cordova Copper Co., 234 U. S. 188.
Since it is impossible to give to the act any applicatiom
to existing circumstances, it must be declared void, or
operative only upon future condition. Farmers' Bank v.

of the treaties by the later act, and in effect makes the
treaty stipulations a part of the act, of equal efficacy
with the provision for discount. The resulting law of the
case is that the duties prescribed by the Tariff Act are
to be discounted five per cent. on imports in American
bottoms and no other or higher duties are to be levied
upon imports in the vessels of treaty nations than in
those of the United States. The number of such treaty
nations would not alter the terms of the act and so could
not alter its construction.
It is immaterial whether or not the treaty clauses involved operate ex proprio vigore, since the very statute
under consideration gives them the force and effect of
laws. Congress has recognized that such treaty provisions are self-executing. Treaty with Great Britain, 1815;
Act of March 1, 1916, 3 Stat. 255; 14th Annals of Congress, 1st sess., p. 674; ibid., pp. 46, 49-50; Reports of
Committee on Foreign Relations, 1789-1901, vol. 8, p. 25.
The executive branch has treated similar treaty provisions as self-executing without legislation by Congress.

has been repeatedly disavowed by this court. Foster v.

243 U. S.

Congress had power to grant the discount to imports
in vessels of the United States and of nations with which
the United States had reciprocal commercial treaty agreements. The contention of the Government makes the
proviso a condition to the taking effect of the main clause
and destroys the subsection in its entirety, while respondents' construction gives effect to the subsection as a whole,
Austin. v. United States, 155 U. S. 417, distinguished;
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 1; McLean v. United States, 226 U. S. 374, 383.
The function of a proviso is to be determined in each
case by what is there intended. It is frequently used to
enlarge the operation of a law as well as to restrict it.
Georgia R. & B. Co. v. Smith, 128 U. S. 174, 181; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25, 36.
A rational interpretation will be given to a statute and
a proviso and not one by which the.statute will, through
the proviso, destroy itself. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491; United States v. Mille Lac Chippewas,
229 U. S. 498.
The provision as it stands, and considered with reference to its terms, has a meaning and bears a sensible construction. It is not a meaningless or contradictory jumble
of words. Explaining or distinguishing: United States v.
Cantril, 4 Cranch, 167; City of Mobile v. Eslava, 16 Pet.
234, 247; In re Hendricks, 60 Kansas, 796; Farmers'Bank
v. Hale, 59 N. Y. 53; InternationalHarvester Company v.
Kentucky, 234 U. S. 216; Texas & Pacific Railway v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 162 U. S. 197, 254.
The provision is not self-contradictory, nor contradictory of the reason of the legislation which vwas discrimination in favor of American shipping. Upon the
contrary, the statute is responsive to that reason and in
aid of that purpose. Pirie v. Chicago Title and Trust Co.,
182 U. S. 438, 451.
The addition of the proviso diminished but did not

exhaust the discrimination effected by the main clause.
This goes to the usefulness of the statute and not its
meaning or validity. United States v. Plowman, 216
U. S. 372, 375; Unity v. Burrage, 103 U. S. 447, 456.
It is not permitted under any rule of statutory construction to say that the proviso was a stroke of legislative finesse, designed by the Senate to nullify the section
as formulated by the House, under pretense of merely
qualifying it. Nothing savoring of fraud or farce may be
imputed to either house. McLean v. United States, 226
U. S. 374, 383.
Courts will decline to avoid an act of legislation upon
any suggestion as to the motives of legislators or of the
unwisdom or impolicy of the act. Weber v. Freed, 239
U. S. 325, 330; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co.,
91 U. S. 72; United States v. Goldenberg, 168 U. S. 95, 102;
Dewey v. United States, 178 U. S. 510, 521.
In our legislation the intent to save treaty rights has
always been manifest. The form of words employed has
varied, but language similar to that of the proviso to
subsection 7 has been frequently used. Acts of March 27,
1804, ยง 6, 2 Stat. 300, c. 57; February 5, 1816, ยง 3, 3 Stat.
253, c. 10; April 27, 1816, ยง 6, 3 Stat. 314, c. 107; January 14, 1817, ยง 1, 3 Stat. 344, c. 3; August 30, 1842, ยง 8,

Presidents, vol. IV, pp. 400, 401; Act July 14, 1862,

Stat. 525, c. 121; Kelly v. Hedden, 124 U. S. 196.
In more recent tariff legislation, Congress, in effecting
its purpose of saving treaty rights, has repeatedly expressed a preference for the precise form of language
found in the proviso of subsection 7. Act March 3, 1891,
26 Stat. 844, c. 534; Treasury Decision, 10824; Acts of
August 27, 1894, par. 182Y, 28 Stat. 521, c. 349; July 24,

243 U. S.

The act is not to be nullified as unwise or impolitic
because it may not in its immediate operation discriminate
in favor of American shipping to the extent Congress intended should ultimately result." By the express terms
of its proviso, it recognizes that the scope of its discrimination will be reduced by treaty provisions. There are
nations whose trade is not protected by any treaty, and
the treaties of some other nations are not comprehensive
of all their trade with us. To such unprotected trade the
discount would not apply. The legislation, as its history
shows, was deliberately enacted, with a full knowledge
of the facts and circumstances to which it applied, and
of how it would operate, and with its consequences very
distinctly pressed upon the attention of Congress. Each
house of Congress conceded something and each house
held to something of its views. The House of Representatives secured the discount on imports in American vessels
and the Senate the preservation of our treaty stipulations
by extending the discount to imports in treaty nation
vessels. A present advantage to American shipping was
intended, which would be great or small as the field of the
practical operation of the proviso was small or great-an
advantage which might be enlarged from time to time
by changes in our treaty agreements. Subsections 1 and 7
of paragraph J of ยง IV of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913,
are laws of the same general nature operating by converse
methods. In each case the advantage conferred by the
general enactments upon American vessels is diminished
by the proviso or qualifying clause as to treaty nation
vessels; in the one case by suspending the discriminating
duty and in the other by extending the discount. In
neither case does the proviso nullify the subsection.
Substantial discrimination in favor of American vessels
in fact results from respondents' construction. The
official figures of our foreign commerce show that, by the
inducement of the five per cent. discount, the volume

of merchandise imported in American vessels may be
greatly increased. The extent to which other nations
share the discount affects only the measure in which the
obvious purpose of the act is realized in operation.

delivered the opinion of the court.

In these cases the Court of Customs Appeals has held
that by ยง IV, paragraph J, subsection 7, of the Act of
October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 196, merchandise
imported in the registered vessels of the United States,
or in the registered vessels of other nations entitled by
treaty to pay no. higher duties than those levied upon
vessels of the United States, is granted a discount of five
per cent. upon the duties imposed by the act. Following
an enactment that, except as otherwise specially provided
in the statute, duties should be levied upon all articles
imported from any foreign country at the rates prescribed
in the schedules, the above mentioned subsection 7 is as
follows: "That a discount of 5 per centum on all duties
imposed by this Act shall be allowed on such goods, wares,
and merchandise as shall be imported in vessels admitted
to registration under the laws of the United States: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall be so construed as to abrogate or in any manner impair or affect
the provisions of any treaty concluded between the United
States and any foreign nation." More or less complete
reciprocity is established by treaty with nearly all the
commercial countries of the world, and the discount of
five per centum was extended by the Court of Customs
Appeals to goods imported in vessels of Belgium, the

Netherlands, Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Japan.
The Government contends that while the subsection
may indicate a reversal of the policy of reciprocity that
has prevailed more or less for the better part of a century,
Rev. Stats., ยง 4228, it relies upon future negotiations to
make the change effective and suspends action while the
present treaties remain in force, sinceit could not give the
discount to merchandise in American bottoms alone without breaking the numerous treaties to which we have
referred. The argument on the other side is that the
words of the subsection are satisfied by extending the discount to goods from' all the treaty countries, whereas by
the construction contended for by the Government they
are emptied of meaning or at least of present effect. We
are of opinion that the Government is right, and as the
meaning of the words seems to us to be intelligible upon a
simple reading and to be fortified by the facts preceding
their adoption, we shall spend no time upon generalities
concerning the principles of interpretation.
We have a clear opinion as to what the subsection means
if the words are taken in their natural, straightforward
and literal sense. It grants a discount only to goods imported in vessels registered under the laws of the United
States, and conditions even that grant upon its not affecting treaties. There is a strong presumption that the
literal meaning is the true one,' especially as against a
construction that is not interpretation but perversion;
that takes from the proviso its ostensible purpose to impose a condition precedent, in order to universalize a
grant that purports to be made to a single class, and to
do so notwithstanding the express requirement of the
statute that specified rates should be paid. Nobody
would express such an intent in such words unless in a contest of opposing interests where the two sides both hoped
to profit by an ambiguous phrase. But the section is

not ambiguous on its face, and there is no sufficient ground
for creating an ambiguity. from without, when it is considered that the purpose to favor American shipping was
the manifest inducement for putting the subsection in.
The tariff bill as it first passed the House granted an
exemption in favor of American shipping without the
proviso. The clause was struck out by the Senate, and
after it had beea pointed out that such an enactment
would violate many treaties there was a conference which
led to the passage of the subsection in its present form.
It seems to us obviously more reasonable to suppose that
Congress was content to indicate a policy to be pursued
when possible than that by circuitous and inapt language
it enacted that there should be a general discount from the
rates specifically directed to be charged. That the subsection means what it says and no more seems to us still
plainer when it is considered that without going into nice
calculations the benefit to American shipping of such a
general discount would be at least problematical and
certainly would be relatively small. A grant in present
terms subject to a condition precedent is familiar to the
law and is not unknown in grants of the present kind.
Dunlap v. United States, 173 U. S. 65.
There was some discussion at the bar and in the court
below upon the question whether the treaties operated
as laws or were simply executory contracts, but it seems
to us superfluous. If the statute bore the meaning attributed to it below it granted the discount to the nations
having treaties of reciprocity, even if those treaties were
only contracts. As in our opinion the subsection means
what it says it grants the discount to none.
Judgmentsallowing the discount of five per centum reversed.
MR. JUSTICE DAY is of opinion that the statute was
ioiterpreted correctly by the Court of Customs Appeals,
and therefore dissents.
