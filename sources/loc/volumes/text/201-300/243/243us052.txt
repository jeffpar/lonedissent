Court of Michigan which is now before us, as we have

STATE OF NEW MEXICO v. LANEj SECRETARY
OF THE INTERIOR, AND TALLMAN, COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE.
IN EQUITY.
No. 20, Original.

Motion to dismiss. Submitted January 8, 1917.-De1917.
cided March 6,

The State of New Mexico filed its bill in this- court naming the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land
Office as the parties defendant and praying that a tract of land,
which the Interior Department had awarded and sold as coal land
to an entryman under the coal land law, be decreed the property of
the State by virtue of the school-land grant to the Territory of New
Mexico, and the State's succession thereto; that the entry proceedings be decreed unlawful and that issuance of patent thereon be
enjoined. Questions concerning the construction of the laws mentioned, and questions of fact concerning the character of the land
and the knowledge of it, were involved.
Held, that the suit must be dismissed as, in substance, a suit, against
the United States. Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70.
Semble, that the presence of the entryman as a party, he having purchased the land and paid the price, would be indispensable to the
granting of the relief prayed.
This court has no original jurisdiction of a suit by a State against citizens of other States I and citizens of the State complaining. Constitution, Art. III, § 2; California v. Southern Pacific Co., 157 U. S.
229.
1The bill avers that Mr. Lane is a citizen of California and Mr.
Tallman a citizen of Nevada, and the entryman, presumably, is a
citizen of New Mexico. See p. 58.

Opinion of the Court.

THE case is stated iDthe opinion.

The Attorney General, The Solicitor General and Mr.
S. W. Williams for defendants, in support of the motion.
Mr. Harvey M. Friend for complainant, in opposition
to the motion.
MR. JUSTICE

MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
Bill for injunction, in which the State of New Mexico
asserts title in fee simple to the S. W. Y of the N. E. 4
of section 16, township 15 N., R. 18 W., New Mexico
principal meridian, under the school-land grant of June 21,
1898, and prdys to restrain the Interior Department from
issuing a patent therefor to one Keepers.
The bill exhibits the grounds of suit as follows:
By § 1 of an act approved June 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 484,
there were granted to the Territory of New Mexico sections 16 and 36 in every township in the State for the
support of common schools. If such sections should be
mineral, other lands were to be granted in lieu thereof,
to be selected as provided in other sections of the act.
Section 6 of an act approved June 20, 1910, 36 Stat.
557, 561, which was an act to enable the people of New
Mexico to form a constitution and state government and
be admitted into the Union, granted, in addition to sections 16 and 36, sections 2 and 32 in every township in
the proposed State not otherwise appropriated at the
date of the passage of the act. This grant also was for
the support of the common schools.
It was provided in § 10 that such lands and those theretofore granted were "expressly transferred and confirmed to the said State," and should "be by the said
State held in trust," etc.
By § 12, except as modified or repealed by the act, all

grants of lands were ratified and confirmed to the State,
subject to the provisions of the act.
On January 6, 1912, New, Mexico was admitted to the
Union on an equal footing with the other States and became and is the beneficiary of the school-land grant of
June 21, 11898. Such grant had been held a grant in
prmsenti under which absolute title in fee to all sections '16
and 36 in' the Territory which were at that date identified
passed tG the Territory at the date of the approval of the
act, unless known to be mineral, and no certificate or
patent was necessary to pass such title.
Township 15 N. of R. 18 W. was surveyed by the
United States Government in 1881. The survey was
approved by the Surveyor General of New Mexico
November 30, 1881, and a township plat duly filed in the
local land office and the land became subject to disposal
Jitly 21, 1882, which was many years prior to the grant
of June 21, 1898.
Section 16 was not disposed of or otherwise reserved and
therefore passed to the Territory by the grant of June 21,
1898, and the land described above was not at that time
known to be mineral in character and was not then known
coal land under the interpretation of the coal land law
which had uniformly prevailed, in that at such date there
had been no attempt on the part of any one to discover
or develop coal upon it and no coal had been produced or
extracted therefrom until 1911, 13 years after the title
in fee had vested in the Territory.
The decision of the Department and of the Supreme
Court (this court) was that land could not be held to be
"known coal land" unless there had been a mine opened
thereon and an actual production of coal in such quantity
as to make the land more valuable on that account than
for other purposes, and that such construction had become a rule of property and title vested under it could not
be divested by a change of construction.

NEW MEXICO v. LANE.
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The construction was known to Congress when it
passed the Act of June 21, 1898, Was adopted by it when
it enacted that act, and became the rule of construction
for the future administration of the land, and the acceptance of the grant became an executed contract between the Territory and the United States to be construed
and interpreted as then understood. Notwithstanding,
the Commissioner of the General Lahd Office and the
Secretary of the Interior have decided that a locator on
the land whose claim was filed in 1911 is entitled to have
a patent for the tract above described and they are about
to issue a patent to him.
On May 12, 1911, one George A. Keepers filed in the
local land office at Sante Fe, New Mexico, a coal declaratory statement under § 2348, Rev. Stats., for the land in
controversy, and three days thereafter he applied to
purchase the same as coal land under § 2347, Rev. Stats.,
and publication of notice thereof as provided'by the
mining laws and regulations of the Interior Department
was. duly had, beginning May 19, 1911, and ending
June 16, 1911.
Within the period of publication protests were filed
against the application, and the Territory of New Mexico
intervened, claiming the land 'under the Act of June 21,
1898, on the ground that it was not coal land at the date
of the grant. A hearing was allowed to determine the
land's character.
It is conceded that the Commissioner of the General
Land Office had the right and authority to determine
the question whether the land was known coal land at
the date of the grant of June 21, 1898. Nevertheless in
such determination that official was restricted to ascertaining the single fact whether at the date of the grant a
mine had been opened on the land or coal produced therefrom, and this was the sole question that he could investigate. But, notwithstanding, he undertook and directed a

243 U. S.

hearing "to determine their true character" at the date
of the hearing, which was in excess of his authority.
At the hearing by the local land office, testimony was
taken largely addressed to the geological condition of the
land and no testimony was adduced showing that any
coal had ever been produced or extracted from the land
prior to the date of the Act of June 21, 1898, or for many
years thereafter and up until 1911. Nevertheless it was
decided, upon developments made subsequently to that
date and on other matters subsequently occurring, including the subsequent classification of the land as coal
land by the Geological Survey in 1907, that the land contained coal at the date of the act and was for that reason
known coal land at that date.
Upon appeal the ruling of the local officers was affirmed
by the Commissioner and subsequently by the First
Assistant Secretary of the Interior. There was no finding
in his decision that the land was of known coal character
at the date of the granting act and the only fact relied.
upon was that certain "disclosures" now, not then, indicated that the Black Diamond coal bed underlay a
portion of the tract, which even if known would not
under the law as then construed and interpreted have
rendered the land known coal land. The decision, therefore, was purely arbitrary.
The State duly filed a motion for re-hearing, which was
denied, and the decision promulgated and the local officers directed to issue a final certificate to Keepers.
The bill avers "that when said final certificate shall be
issued, as it undoubtedly has been, and upon its receipt
at the General Land Office, the officials thereof, following
the regulations of the Interior Department in such cases
made and provided, will -at once proceed to issue a patent
to said Keepers for said S. W. Y4 of the N. E. Y4 of said
section 16, unless restrained by this honorable court in
the meantime, which said tract is owned by and belongs

Opinion of the Court.

to your orator as a part of its school-land grant which
was vested immediately in fee in the Territory of New
Mexico, at the date of said school-land grant of June 21,
1898, to which right and title your orator has succeeded,
as aforesaid, and such patent, if issued to said Keepers,
will be a cloud upon the title of your orator to said tract,
being an attempt, unlawfully, to deprive your orator of
its title in fee simple thereto."
It is prayed that the Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of the General Land Office be subpcenaed
to appear and answer the bill, but not under oath; that it
be decreed that the title immediately vested in the Territory of New Mexico at the date of the Act of June 21,
1898, and has become vested in the State as the successor
of the Territory; that the Secretary and Commissioner
have not had since the date oif
the act or now have authority to interfere with the State's title and that they
be enjoined from executing their orders and decision.
General relief is also prayed.
A motion to dismiss the bill is made on the grounds:
(1) The United States is a necessary party because it
appears the title to the land involved is in the United
States, and that it is the purpose of the defendants to
dispose of the land in accordance with the provisions of
the mineral land laws of the United States, and that if
the defendants be enjoined from executing such purpose
the United States would be deprived of the purchase
price of the land. (2) It appears from the bill that the
State has no title or interest in the land because it was
known coal land at the date of the passage of the Act
of June 21, 1898, and was not 'intended to be granted nor
granted to the Territory of New Mexico by that act nor
any subsequent act. (3) That complete inquiry was
made by the officers of the Land Department and they
found the fact to be that at the date of the act the land
was known to be valuable for mineral purposes. -(4) It

appears that one. Keepers had purchased the land and
therefore was an indispensable party. (5) The bill is in
other respects uncertain, informal and insufficient and does
not state facts sufficient to entitle the State to any relief.
The motion should be granted on the ground that the
suit is one against the United States, under the authority
of Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70. In that case a bill
was brought in this court to establish the title of the
State of Louisiana to certain swamp lands which it claimed
under the statutes of the United States and to enjoin the
Secretary of the Interior and other officers of the Land
Department from carrying out an order making different
disposition of the land.
Under the statute it was contended the land vested in
the State in fee simple, that is, the act was contended to
have the same character and efficacy as the Act of June 21,
1898, is asserted to have in the case at bar. And certain
facts were necessary to be determined as elements of
decision. This court said that in the case there were
questions of law and of fact upon which-the United States
would have to be heard. So in the present case there is a
question of law whether the Act of June 21, 1898, had the
quality as a grant of the land asserted of it, whether of
itself--or because of its terms or \their prior construction
and its adoption, indeed, whether there was such a prior
construction or its adoption, and again of the fact of the
character of the land at the time of the grant -and the
evidence of it and the knowledge of it.
It would-seem, besides, that under the averments of
the bill Keepers is an indispensable party, he having become, according to the bill, a purchaser of the land and
paid the purchase price thereof. To make him a party
"would oust this court of jurisdiction, if he is a citizen of
New Mexico, and the presumption expressed by defendants that he is, complainant does not deny. Californiav.
