WILLIAMS v. STATE OF ARKANSAS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.

No. 138.

Submitted March 11, 1910.-Decided April 4, 1910.

State legislation which in carrying out a public purpose is limited in
its application, is not a denial of equal protection of the laws within
the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment if within the sphere
of its operation it affects alike all persons similarly situated. Barbier v. Cowolly, 113 U. S. 27.
When a state legislature has declared that, in its opinion, the policy
of the State requires a certain measure, its action should not be
disturbed by the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment, unless
they can clearly see that there is no reason why the law should not
be extended to classes left untouched. Missouri, Kansa. & Texas
Railway Co. v. May; 194 U. S. 267.
A classification in a state statute prohibiting drumming or soliciting
on trains for business for any "hotels, lodging houses, eating houses,
bath houses, physicians, masseurs, surgeon or other medical practitioner" will not be held by this court to be unreasonable and
amounting to denial of equal protection of the laws, after it has
been sustained by the state court as meeting an existing condition
which was required to be met; and so held that the anti-drumming
or soliciting law of Arkansas of 1907 is not unconstitutional because
it relates to the above classes alone and does not prohibit drumming
and soliciting for other purposes.
85 Arkansas, 470, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the antidrumming law of Arkansas of 1907, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George B. Rose, with whom Mr. U. M. Rose, Mr. W. E.
Hemingway, Mr. D. H. Cantrell and Mr. J. P. Loughborough
were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The act is unconstitutional as it deprives appellant of the
liberty and the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is an unlawful restriction upon the liberty of the citizen.
The guaranty of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
secures to the citizen the right to pursue any calling not injurious to the public and to protect him against all interference with his business not in the lawful exercise of the police
power. The police power is limited to those things essential
to the safety, health, comfort and morals of the community,
and any enactment seeking to restrict the liberty of a citizen
in matters not falling within the scope of the police power as
thus defined, is unconstitutional and void.
The occupation of drumming or soliciting for legitimate
forms of business is not merely a lawful, but a fiost important,
calling. In this particular instance, the appellant is earning
his livelihood by drumming and soliciting for his own boarding house.
This is not a case of an occupation tax. The drummers
are not taxed; they are forbidden altogether to exercise their
callings. As to the right to pursue any lawful business, see
Butcheri' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co., 111 U. S. 757;
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S.
137; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 589; Lochner v. New
York, 198 [U. S. 57. The principles announced by this court

The claim that this aQt merely prevents appellant from
soliciting custom for his boarding house, and does not interfere with his right to conduct it, begs the question. The
right to advertise a business and to solicit custom is essentially an incident to the right to do business. See Robbins

The statute cannot be justified on the principle that it
applies only to persons traveling upon railroads. Passengers
who avail themselves of their services do not surrender their
liberty as citizens; nor can the act be justified on the ground
that it tends to secure the comfort of other passengers.
Cooley's Const. Lim., 6th ed., 510-518.
Under the common law, to solicit a person's patronage for
a hotel or boarding house was not a crime, and therefore it is
not within the power of the legislature to make such use of
the rightof free speech an offense.
The act also deprives the citizen of the equal protection of
the law. It applies only to the*keepers of hotels, lodging,
eating and bath houses, among pursuits open to all the world.
It applies also to medical practitioners; but as their vocation
is one which concerns the public health and which is not
pursued as of right, but only by leave of the State, they are
legitimately subject to police regulation, and for the purposes
of this case, they may be dismissed from our consideration.
Acts which single out one class of citizens and imllpose upon
them burdens or restraints not imposed upon others, can
only be justified by inherent differences. If they are merely
arbitrary, they deny to the citizen the equal protection of
the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The
equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the potection of
equal laws. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 368. The
requirement of equal laws does not exclude classification,
but the classification must not be arbitrary. It must be based
on reason. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Ellis, 165 U. S.

This court has of late refused to set aside a number of
state laws on the ground that they were in conflict with the
equality clause; but it seems that the case now presented
shows an oppressive and inexcusable violation of the equality
clause, and that the act should be held unconstitutional in
so far as it applies to keepers of boarding houses.
Mr. Hal. L. Norwood, Attorney General of the State of
Arkansas, Mr. C. A. Cunnir ham and Mr. William F. Kirby,
for defendant in error:
The statute is a police regulation and clearly within the
power of the State. The State has the inherent power to
make all laws niecessary for the protection of the health,
safety, morals and comfort of its citizens and to promote the
public convenience and general welfare.
The rights of property and liberty even, guaranteed by
the Constitution against deprivation without due process of
law, are subject to such reasonable restraints under the police
power as the common good or general welfare may require.
It is within the province of the legislature to declare the
public policy and it has broad discretion to determine what
the public interests require and what measures are necessary
for their protection.
The purpose of the act is apparent. It was to promote the
comfort of the public traveling upon railroad trains in the
State, and especially of passengers journeying to Hot Springs.

carriers," approved April 30, 1907. Acts of General Assembly,
1907, p. 553, Act, 236.
The first and second sections of that act are as follows:
"SEc. 1. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons,
except as hereinafter provided in section 2 of this act, to
drum or solicit business or patronage for any hotel, lodging
house, eating house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon,
or other medical practitioner, on the train, cars, or depots
of any railroad or common carrier operating or running within
the State of Arkansas.
"Any person or persons plying or -attempting to ply said
vocation of drumming or soliciting, except as provided in
section 2 of this act, upon the trains, cars, depots of said
railroads or common carriers, shall be deemed guilty of -a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished
by a fine of not less than fifty ($50) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100) for each offense.
"SEc.

2. That it shall be unlawful for any railroad or

common carrier operating a line within the State of Arkansas
knowingly to permit its trains, cars or depots within the State
to be used by any person or persons for drumming or soliciting
business or patronage for any hotel, lodging house, eating
house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon, or other medical practitioner, or drumming or soliciting for any business or
profession whatsoever; except, that it may be lawful for railroads or common carriers to permit agents of transfer companies on. their trains to check baggage or provide transfers for
passengers, or for persons or corporations to sell periodicals and
such other articles as are usually sold by news agencies for
the convenience and accommodation of said passengers.
"And it shall be the duty of the conductor or person in
charge of the train of any railroad or common carrier to
report to the prosecuting attorney any person or persons
found violating any of the provisions of this act, and upon a
wilful failure or neglect to report any such person or persons
known to be violating the provisions of this act by drumming

WILLIAMS v. ARKANSAS.
217 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

or soliciting said conductor or other person in charge of such
train shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined not less than fifty nor more
than one hundred dollars."
The case was tried upon the following agreed statement of
facts:
"The defendant has for six years been keeping a boarding
house in the city of Hot Springs and was keeping the same on
the 10th day of December, 1907, when he entered a train of
the Little Rock and Hot Springs Western Railway Compan.y
while running in the county of Garland and State of Arkansas,
and solicited and drummed the passengers on said train to
induce them to come to his said boarding house to board
during their sojourn in said city; and said defendant was so
engaged in drumming and soliciting upon said train when he
was arrested. He had paid his fare as a passenger on said train,
and was riding as such passenger while engaged in drumming
and soliciting."
Plaintiff in error challenged the act as unconstitutional on
the grounds that it deprived him of liberty and property
without due process of law, and also of the equal protection
of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The principles that govern this case have been settled by
very many adjudications of this court. They were sufficiently
set forth in McLean v. State of Arkansas,. 211 U. S.546, in
which a statute making it unlawful for mine owners, employing ten or more men underground in mining coal and paying
therefor by the ton mined, to screen the coal before it was
weighed, was held valid; and also that it was not an unreasonable classification to divide coal mines into those where less
than ten miners were employed and those where more than
that number were employed, and that a state police regulation was not unconstitutional under the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because only applicable
to mines where more than ten miners were employed. This
court in that case, discussing the police power, said:

pinion of the Court.

217 U.S.

"In Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183, this court summarized the doctrine as follows: "' Regulations respecting the pursuit of a lawful trade or
business are of very frequent occurrence in the various cities
of the country, and what such regulations shall be and to
what particular trade, business or occupation they shall apply,
are questions for the State to determine, and their determination comes within the proper exercise of the police power by
the State, and unless the regulations are so utterly unreasonable and extravagant in their nature and purpose that the
property and personal rights of the citizen are unnecessarily,
and in a manner wholly arbitrary interfered with or destroyed,
without due process of law, they do not extend beyond the
power of the State to pass, and they form no subject for
Federal interference.'
"In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, this court said:
"' But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United
States to every person within its jurisdiction, does not import
an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all
circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is subject for the common good.'
"It is then the established doctrine of this court that the
liberty of contract is not universal, and is; subject to restrictions passed by the legislative branch of the government in
the exercise of its power to protect the safety, health and
welfare of the people.
:;The legislature being familiar, with local conditions, is
primarily the judge of the necessity of such enactments. The
mere fact that a court may differ with the legislature n its
views of public policy, or that judges may hold views inconsistenL with the propriety of the legislation in question, affo'rIts
no ground for judicial interference, uniess the act in question
is unmistakably and palpably in excess of legislative power.
"f

protection of the public health, safety or welfare, it is not to
be set aside because the judiciary may be of opinion that the
act will fail of its purpose or because it is thought to be an
unwise exertion of the authority vested in the legislative
branch of the government."
And see Donovan v. Pennsylvania Company, 199 U. S. 279.
In the present case the Supreme Court of Arkansas (Williams v. State, 85 Arkansas, 470) said.
"The legislature clearly has the power to make regulation
for the convenience and comfort of travelers on railroads, and
this appears to be a reasonable regulation for their benefit.
It prevents annoyance from the importunities of drummers.
It is suggested in argument that the statute. was especially
aimed at the protection of travelers to the city of Hot Springs.
If this be so; we can readily see additional reason why the
regulation is a wholesome one. A large percentage of those
travelers are persons from distant States, who are mostly
complete strangers here, and many are sick. Drummers
who swarm through the trains soliciting for physicians, bath
houses, hotels, etc., make existence a burden to those who are
subjected to their repeated solicitations. It is true that the
traveler may turn a deaf ear to these importunities, but this
does not render it any the less unpleasant and annoying.
The drummer may keep withui the law against disorderly
conduct, and still render himself a source of annoyance to
travelers by his much beseeching to be allowed to lead the
way to a doctor or a hotel.
"It is also argued that the act, literally construed, Would prevent any person of the classes named from carrying on a private
conversation on a train concerning his business. This is quite an
extreme construction to place upon the statute, and one which
the legislature manifestly did not intend. We have no such
question, however, before us on the facts presented in the

record.
"This statute is not an unreasonable restriction upon the
privilege one should enjoy. to solicit for his lawful business;

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

217 U. S.

which, it is rightly urged, is an incident to any business. It
does not prevent any one from advertising his business or
from soliciting patronage, except upon trains, etc. This
privilege is denied him for the public good. It is a principle
which underlies every reasonable exercise of the police power
that private rights must yield to the common welfare."
As to the objection that the act discriminated against
plaintiff in error and denied him the equal protection of the
law, because forbidding the drumming or soliciting business
or patronage on the trains for any "hotel, lodging house,
eating house, bath house, physician, masseur, surgeon, or
other medical practitioner," which it was contended was an
unreasonable classification, the state Supreme Court said:
"The legislature, in framing this statute, met a condition
which existed, and not an imaginary or improbable one. The
class of drummers or solicitors mentioned in the act are doubtless the only ones who ply their vocation to any extent on
railroad trains. It is rare that the commercial drummer finds
opportunity to meet customers and solicit trade on trains,
therefore the lawmakers deemed it unnecessary to legislate
against an occasional act of that kind."
It is settled that legislation which "in carrying out a public
purpose is limited in its application, if within the sphere of its
operation it affects alike all persons similarily situated, is not
within the amendment," Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U. S. 27,
and "When a State legislature has declared that, in its opinion,
policy requires a certain measure, its action should not be
disturbed by the court under the Fourteenth Amendment,
unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the
law that would not require with equal force its extension to
others whom it leaves untouched." Missouri, Kansas &
Texas Ry. Co. v. May, 194 U. S. 267.
Judgiment affirmed.
