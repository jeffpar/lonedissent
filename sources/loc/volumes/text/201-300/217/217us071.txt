FRELLSEN & CO. v. CRANDELL.
217 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

FRELLSEN AND COMPANY v. CRANDELL, REGISTER
OF THE STATE LAND OFFICE OF LOUISIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOtlISIAI1A.

No. 129. Argued March 7, 8, 1910.-Decided April 4, 1910.

Whether a patent is wrongfully issued or can be set aside is a matter
to be settled between the State and the patentee, but no individual
is authorized to act for the State.
Even if the State could set aside a patent for having been issued on
illegal or inadeouate consideration the matter is between it and
the patentee; and, until set aside, one tendering the statutory price
does not thereby become entitled to receive such land from the
State, nor does the tender create a contract with the State within
the protection of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution.
Where the state court so holds, public land of a State, as is the case
of public land of the United States, held under patent or certificate
of location, is not, until such patent or certificate be set aside at
the instance of the State, subject to other entry or purchase.
In the matter of sale and conveyance each State may administer its
public lands as it sees fit so long as it does not conflict with rights
guaranteed by the Federal Constitution; nor is any State obliged
to follow the legislation or decisions of the Federal Government or
of any other State.

by an act entitled "An act to Aid the State of
Louisiana in Draining the Swamp Lands therein," approved
March 2, 1849 (9 Stat. 352, c. 87), granted to that State "the
whole of those swamp and overflowed lands" in her borders,
"which may be or are found unfit for cultivation." See also
act of September 28, 1850, 9 Stat. 519. In 1880 the general assembly of the State of Louisiana, by an act known as "Act 23
of 1880," approved March 8, 1880 (Laws La., 1880, c.84,
p. 25), authorized the governor of the State t6 institute proceedings to recover all of those lands not alrea4y conveyed to
the State, or, if improperly failed to be conveyed, their value
in money or government scrip, "provided, that the State shall

incur no cost or expense. in the prosecution of the said claims
other than an allowance to be made by the governor out of
the lands, money or scrip that may be recovered." On March
20, 1880, the governor made a contract with John McEnery
to recover from the United States the unconveyed balance
of the lands, or their value in money or scrip, and agreed to
pay him ".fifty per centum of the lands, money or scrip recovered, to be paid as provided in said Act 23." It also provided': "'Wherelands in kind are recovered, the compensation
as aforesaid, of the said McEnery, shall be represented in scrip
or certificates, to be issued by the register of the land office of
the State, and locatable upon any lands owned by the State."
A large amount of lands were recovered, and the register of
the state land office issued to John McEnery certificates in
terms made locatable upon any vacant land granted to the
State by, the act of Congress heretofore referred to. These certificates were sold and assigned by M4enery, and his assignees
located them upon public lands, some of which had not been
recovered by McEnery under his contract. To some of the assignees. patents were thereafter Issued, while others held simply
certificates of location. By Act 106 of 1888 (Laws La.,
1888, p. 171) Act 23 of 1880 was repealed, and by ยง 2 of the
repealing- act it was provided "that the act or agreement made
between Louis A. Wiltz, governor of the State, and John
McEnery, made March 20, 1880, purporting to be under the
authority of said Act No. 23, is hereby abrogated and terminated." This repealing act took effect January 1, 1889. By
Act No. 125, approved July 8, 1902 (Laws La., 1902, p. 209), it
was provided that the swamp and overflowed lands donated by
Con ess to the State shauld be subject to entry and sale at
the rate of $1.50 per acre. On July 7, 1906, the legislature
passed Act No. 85 of 1906 (Laws La., 1906, p. 141), declaring
"that present holders and owners of patents for public lands,
issued by the State of Louisiana, their heirs, assignees or transferees, shall be confirmed as applicants for said lands, from the
date of the issuance of said patentr, where the said patents

were not paid for in money, but were paid for by certificates
or warrants for scrip, which were not legally receivable in payment for such patents, and authorizing such present holders
and owners, their heirs, assignees or transferees, of said patents
to validate and perfect their title to the lands covered by said
patents, or to any part or subdivision of such lands, within
one year from date of passage of this act, by paying therefor,
in cash, the price of one dollar and fifty cents per acre." The
act further provided that upon payment of such amount
"the said patents shall be valid and legal for all purposes, as
if payment therefor had been made in cash at the date of their
issuance."
Petitioners, claiming that the location of these certificates
upon lands not recovered by McEnery and the issuance of
patents therefor were illegal, tendered on March 28, 1905, to
the proper officers $1.50 per acre for a large body of lands
which were covered by these certificates and patents. They
demanded that warrants should be issued to them for the
lands, which was refused. On July 11, 1906, they filed their
petition in the Twenty-second Judicial District Court for the
Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, averring that
they were the first and only applicants for said lands under
the provisions of said Act No. 125 of 1902, or of any other law
of the State since the date of the issuance of said illegal certificates and patents, and that by making the legal tender they
became vested with the right to acquire said lands.
The District Court sustained the exception of no cause of
action and entered judgment dismissing the suit. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, 120
Louisiana, 712, and from that court was brought here on writ of
error.

In Emblen v. Lincoln Land Co., 184 U. S. 660, Re Emblen, 161
U. S. 52, and Small v. Crandell, 118 Louisiana, 1052, the patents were not actually null and void. United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U. S. 70, can also be distinguished. If, however,
the patent is actually null and void the land is not segregated
but remains open to entry. St. Louis Smelting Co. v. Kemp,
104 U. S. 645; Doolan v. Carr, 125 U. S. 625.
The patents issued for McEnery scrip being void, plaintiffs
in error acquired a vested interest in the land covered by such
patents when they made formal application and tender in
compliance with the law of the State. Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1.
The McEnery certificates were issued in pursuance of a contract of compensation and related solely to the lands recovered
through McEnery. Making them locatable on any public
lands including those not recovered through him was illegal
andthe locations made thereunder on land not so recovered
were actually void and did not operate to segregate.
Defendants in error rely on Western R. R. Co. v. United
States, 108 U. S. 510; McLaughlin v. United States, 107 U. S.
526; United States v. San Jacinto Co., 125 U. S. 273; but in
none of these cases was the patent void. And see United
States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 535, in which the effect of a void patent
is referred to. See also Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 439; McMichael v. Murphy, 197 U. S. 304. ()oodloe v. Register, 47 La.
Ann. 568, can also be distinguished. In Mdenery v. Nichols,
42 La. Ann. 209, no scrip was before the court and its invalidity was not noticed, and the only lands involved in that
case were those recovered by McEnery.

FRELLSEN & CO. v. CRANDELL.
217 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

Ma. CImF JusTIcE FULLER delivered the opinion of the
court, after reading the following memorandum:
This opinion, including the preliminary statement, was
prepared by our Brother Brewer, and had been approved
before his lamented death. It was recirculated and again
agreed to, and is adopted as the opinion of the court.
Petitioners contend that by their tender they made a contract with the State for a conveyance of the lands in controversy; that this contract was broken, and that they were
deprived of their rights thereunder by the legislation of the
State and the action of its officers in pursuance thereof; that
thus a Federal question arises under Art. I, ยง 10, of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a State to pass a
"law impairing the obligation of contracts." Their argument
is briefly this: The lands were not obtained by McEnery under
his contract with the State; the statute authorizing that contract provided that his payment should be solely out of the
lands obtained by him from the United States. Notwithstanding this limitation, certificates were issued to him
authorizing location upon any lands included within *the
grant of Congress by the act of 1849, and they were in fact
located upon the lands in controversy-lands which were not
obtained by McEnery; that this location, even when followed
by patent, did not segregate these lands from the public
domain of the State, and they remained therefore open to
purchase by any one complying with the statutes; that petitioners were the first and only parties who tendered to the
State the prescribed price; that thereby they acquired a
vest right to a conveyance by the State of the legal title.
But it is not contended that the patents were not signed by
the proper officers and in due form to convey the title of the
State to the patentees. It is not suggested that McEnery
received any greater amount of lands than he was entitled to
receive under is contract, and it does nob appear from the

record that the patents, on their face, disclosed any invalidity
in the title conveyed. While an examination of the records
would, if the facts stated in the petition are true, show that
they were improperly issued yet this could be ascertained
only by looking beyond the face of the patent. Now, whether
the patents were wrongfully issued or could be set aside was a
matter to be settled between the State and the patentee. The
State undoubtedly recefved something, for the acceptance of
every McEnery certificate released the-State pro tanto from its
obligation under the contract to McEnery. โข Whether it should
remain satisfied with that payment or not was for the State
to determine. If it were, not satisfied it could take proper
proceedings to set aside the patent, but no individual was authorized to act for the State.
The rule in respect to the administration of the public
domain of the United States is well settled. In Doolan v.
Cart, 125 U. S. 618, 624, Mr. Justice Miller said:
"There is no question as to the principle that where the
officers of the Government have issued a patent in due form
of law, which on its face is sufficient to convey the title to the
land described in it, such patent is to be treated as valid in
actions at law, as distinguished from suits in equity, subject,
however, at all times to the inquiry whether such officers
had the lawful authority to make a c6nveyance of the title.
But if those officers acted without authority -f .the land
which they purported to convey had never been within their
control, or had been withdrawn from that control at the time
they undertook to exercise such authority, then their act was
void--void for want of power in them to act on the subjectmatter of the patent, not merely voidable; in which latter
case, if the circumstances justified such a decree, a direct
proceeding, with proper averments and evidence, would be
required to establish that it was voidable, and should therefore be avoided."
In Hastings &c. Railroad .Company v. Whitney, 132 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Interior, discussed the question of a homestead ertry, and,
after referring to Kansas Pacific Railwau Co. v. Dunmeyer, 113
U. S. 629, added:
"Counsel for plaintiff in error contends that the case just
cited has no application to the one we are now considering,
the .difference beirig that in that case the entry existing at the
time of the location of the road was an entry vaiid in all
respects, while the entry in this case was invialid on its face,
and in its inception; and that this entry having been made by
an agent of the applicant, and based upon an affidavit, which
failed to show the settlement and improvement required by
law, was, -on its face, not such a proceeding in.
the proper land
office, as could attach even an inchoate right to the land.
"We do not think, this contention can be maintained.
Under the homestead law three things are needed to be done
in order to constitute an entry on public lands. . .
If
either one of these integral parts of an entry is defective, that
is, if the affidavit be insufficient in its showing, or if the
application itself is informal, or if the payment is not made in
actual cash, the register and receiver are justified in rejecting
the application. But if, notwithstanding these detects, the
application is allowed by the land officers, and a certificate of
entry is delivered to the applicant, and the entry is made of
record, such entry may be afterwards canceled on account of
these defects by the Commissioner, or on appeal by the Secretary of the Interior; or, as is often the practice, the entry may
be suspended, a hearing ordered, and the party notified to
show by supplemental proof a full compliance with the
requirements of the department; and on failure to do so the
entry may then be canceled. But these defects, whether they
be of form or substance, by no means render the entry absolutely a nullity. So long as it remains a subsisting entry of
record, whose legality has been passed upon by the land
authorities, and their action remains unreversed, it is such
an appropriation of the tract as segregates it from the public
domain, and therefore precludes it from subsequent grants."

Opinion of the Court.

In In re Emblen, 161 U. S. 52, 56, Mr. Justice Gray thus
stated the law:
"After the patent has once been issued, the original contest
is no longer within the jurisdiction of the land department.
The patent conveys the legal title to the patentee; and cannot
be revoked or set aside, except upon judicial proceedings
instituted in behalf of the United States. The only remedy
of Emblen is by bill in equity to charge Weed with a trust in
his favor. All this is clearly settled by previous decisions of,
this court, including -ome of those on which the petitioner
most relies. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72; Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530; Marquez v. Frisbie,101 U. S. 473; Smelting
Company v. Kemp, 104 U. S. 636; Steel v. Smelting Company,
106 U. S. 447; Monroe Cattle Company v. Becker. 147 U. S.
47; Turner v. Sawyer, 150 U. S. 578, 586."
See also McMichael v. Murphy, 197 U. S. 304, 311.
Obviously, in this case the Supreme Court of Louisiana
followed the, practice obtaining in respect to the public lands
of the United States. But if it had not and had declared
simply the law of the State of Louisiana its decision would,
doubtless, be controlling on this court, for, in the matter of
the sale and conveyance of lands belonging to the public no
one State- is obliged to follow the legislation or decisions of
another State, or even those of the United States, but may
administer its public lands in any way that it sees *fit, so long
as it does not conflict with rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.
Counsel criticize the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Louisiana, in that it speaks of all the lands as having gone to
patent while it is said in the petition that some of the assignees
"stood upon the certificates." Whether the language of the
petition technically justifies the construction placed upon it
by the Supreme Court of the State, is immaterial. Certainly,
there is no naming of aniy single tract as covered by certificate
alone and not patented. and if any tract was held under a
certificate of location it was, within the scope of the rul-

WILLIAMS v. STATE OF ARKANSAS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.

No. 138.

Submitted March 11, 1910.-Decided April 4, 1910.

State legislation which in carrying out a public purpose is limited in
its application, is not a denial of equal protection of the laws within
the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment if within the sphere
of its operation it affects alike all persons similarly situated. Barbier v. Cowolly, 113 U. S. 27.
When a state legislature has declared that, in its opinion, the policy
of the State requires a certain measure, its action should not be
disturbed by the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment, unless
they can clearly see that there is no reason why the law should not
be extended to classes left untouched. Missouri, Kansa. & Texas
Railway Co. v. May; 194 U. S. 267.
A classification in a state statute prohibiting drumming or soliciting
on trains for business for any "hotels, lodging houses, eating houses,
bath houses, physicians, masseurs, surgeon or other medical practitioner" will not be held by this court to be unreasonable and
amounting to denial of equal protection of the laws, after it has
been sustained by the state court as meeting an existing condition
which was required to be met; and so held that the anti-drumming
or soliciting law of Arkansas of 1907 is not unconstitutional because
it relates to the above classes alone and does not prohibit drumming
and soliciting for other purposes.
85 Arkansas, 470, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the antidrumming law of Arkansas of 1907, are stated in the opinion.
