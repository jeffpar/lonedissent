The suit against the Southern Railway was based upon a
statutory cause of action and the suit against the other defendants was based upon a common-law right, if any right.
The two separate causes of action were blended in one count
and thus made a .separable controversy. Helms v. N. P.

Eliminating from the petition all the paragraphs that
refer to defendants other than the railroad company the
petition still made on its face a case authorizing a recovery
against the railway company and the same was therefore removable.
When the case was sued in Hall Superior Court, and removed into the Circuit Court, the cause of action as well as
the case was removed and the plaintiff could not, by any act
of his again bestow jurisdiction upon the state court. Kern

U. S. 92; RailroadCo. v. Wangelin, 132 U. S. 599.
If the plaintiff elects to bring a joint action, the defendant
has no right to say that the action shall be severable. Railroad
Co. v. Ide, 114 U. S. 52; and this is so even though the plaintiff
has misconceived his cause of action and has no right to
prosecute the same jointly. Railroad Co. v. Thompson, 200
U. S.'206; Railway Co. v. Bohon, 200 U. S. 221.
But this action is well brought jointly against the defendants. Georgia having a statute which makes a railroad responsible to one employd for the negligence of a fellow-servant,
the negligent servant is liable tZ his fellow-servants for injuries inflicted by such negligent sevant. See Morrison v.
Railroad Co., 74 Pac. Rep. (Wash.) 1064; Howe v. Railroad
Co., 30 Washington, 569; Abel v. Railroad Co., 73 S. C. 173;
Warrax v. Railroad Co., 72 Fed. Rep..637; Railroad Co. v.
Dickson, 179 U. S. 131.
The point in the brief for plaintiffs in error that the acts of
negligence charged against the employd defendants were acts
of non-feasance merely, and that for such acts only the master
is liable,-is untenable in negligence cases. Railway Co. v.

was for the state court to decide whether it would permit
persons to be joined who were guilty of misfeasance or nonfeasance. No Federal question is raised in this particular.
After dismissal in United States court, case can be brought

Upon the voluntary (lismissal of a suit in the United States
court, ihe jurisdiction of the United States court is ended; it
no longer has control over the cause of action, as its control
over the cause of action only lasfed while the case was actually
pending. When the case is dismissed the jurisdiction of the
United States court is wholly divest&l'and the plaintiff is just

The cases cited by plaintiff in error only go to the extent of
holding that when a defendant removes a case from a state
court to a Federal court, so long as that case is pending in the
Federal court, the jurisdiction of the state court is completely
Ousted. See Mclver v. Railroad Co., 110 Georgia, 223, distinguished.
The only case sustaining contentions of plaintiff in error, is
Railroad Co. v. Fulton, 59 Ohio St. 575, which was based upon
a mistaken interpretation of the case of Cox v. Railroad Co.,

Young Case, 55 S. E. Rep. 765; note to 7 L. R. A. (N. S.) 501.
MR. JusTicE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

juries received by him while in the employ of the railroad
company as an engineer. A recovery in the court of original
jurisdiction was affirmed in the Court of Appeals of Georgia
(59 S.E. Rep. 1115), and the case is brought here to review
certain Federal questions presented by the record. These are,
first, that the state court erred in refusing to remove the case
to the United States Circuit Court upon the petition of the
plaintiff in error; second, as it appeared that the case had once
been removed to. the Federal court and was dismissed by the
plaintiff,: the state court should have held that the right to
further prosecute in that court was lost, and the jurisdiction
completely and finally transferred to the Federal court.
In order to determine these questions it is necessary to state
how the case arose. Originally this suit was brought against
the Southern Railway Company alone, to recover damages
for injuries charged to have been inflicted, because the train
upon which the plaintiff was engineer was permitted to run
from the main track through an open switch on to a siding
where another train was standing, when,. by reason of the rules
and regulations of the company in the circumstances set forth,
plaintiff's train had the right of way upon the track, and, because the switch was turned the wrong way, plaintiff's train
was thrown into the siding upon which the other train was
standing, and in order to avoid more serious injury plaintiff
jumped. from his engine, and was greatly injured.
The first suit, being against the Southern Railway Company'
alone, was removed to the United States Circuit Court, the
transcript of record was duly filed, and the company answered.
Thereafter the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case, and
later began the present case against the Southern Railway
Company for the same injury and joined Cox, Voil and Hurst
as parties defendant. These parties were, respectively, the
conductor of the train with which plaintiff's train collided, the
engineer and front brakeman of said train. The negligence
charged was that the brakeman negligently failed to tuni the
switch. back to the main line after his train went into the sid-

SOUTHERN RY. CO. v. MILLER.
217 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ing; that Cox, the'conductor, was in control and management
of the train, and under the duty of seeing that the switch was
turned to the main line; and that Voil, the engineer, after he
got his engine into the siding with the exercise of ordinary care
should have known that the switch was turned wrong, and
yet failed to take any steps to report the situation or to have
it remedied. It was further alleged that the individual defendants, in causing the switch to be unlocked and turned
from the main line, were guilty of negligence, which was the
negligence of the railroad company, inasmuch as they represented the company in the operation of the train which collided
with the plaintiff's train. It is also alleged that the individual
defendants should have flagged the plaintiff's train if for any
reason the switch remained turned to the side track.
The petition for removal contained no charge that the attempt to join the defendants was for the purpose of fraudulently avoiding the jurisdiction of the United States. court, or
with a View to defeat a removal thereto. The case here presented is one in which, the record discloses there was an attempt to join, in good faith, the railway company and the
individual defendants as for a joint liability in tort.
Under the practice in Georgia the case went to the Court of
Appeals of that State on the question of the right to remove
the case to the Federal court. The decision of the Court of
Appeals upon that question is reported in 1 Ga. App. 616; 57
S. E. Rep. 1020. In that case the court dealt with the right
under the law of Georgia to join the individual defendants
with the railroad company, and held that the objections to
joinder were untenable, and that there was no separable 'controversy, either at common law or under the statutes of
Georgia. In an opinion by the chief judge it was held that the
acts of negligence charged against the individual defendants
involved both acts of omission and commission, and were not
merely matters of non-feasance, for which the agents would
not be jointly liable with the principal. The court further held
that the objection that the liability of the railroad company

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.
Opinion of the Court.

217 U. S.

was statutory and that of the other defendants at common law
made no difference in the right to join the defendants, and
that, under the statute law of Georgia, the acts of hegligence
set out in the. declaration against the individual defendants
may have amounted to criminal negligence, in which event
both the railroad company and the individual defendants were
jointly liable to the plaintiff under the law of the State. In
view of the conclusions which the learned court reached it
further held that the case was ruled by Alabama & Great
Southern R. R. Co. v. Thompson, 200 U. S. 206. We agree with
that conclusion. In that case it was held that, for the purposes
of determining the removability of a cause the case must be
deemed to be such as the plaintiff has made it in good faith in
his pleadings. See also Railway Co. v. Bohon, 200 U. S.221.
There was no error in the refusal to remove the case.
A further objection is made that inasmuch as the suit was
once removed from the state court to the Federal court and
therein dismissed, there was no right to begin the case again
in the state court. This argument is predicated upon the statement in a number of cases in this court, to the effect that
where the petition for removal and bond has been filed the
state court loses jurisdiction of the case, and subsequent proceedings therein are void and of no effect. But this is far from
holding that a Federal court obtains jurisdiction of i suit thus
removed in such wise that it can never again be brought in a
state court, although there has been no judgment upon the
inerits in the Federal court, and the case has been dismissed
th .;rei; Ti.hout any other disposition than is involved in a
vot,.uiry dismissal with the consent of the court.
While it is true that a compliance with the act of Congress
entitling the party to remove the case may operate to end the
jurisdiction of the state court, notwithstanding it refuses to
allow such removal, it by no means follows that the state court
may not acquire jurisdiction in some proper way of the same
cause of action after the case has been dismissed without final
judgment in a Federal court. By complying with the removal

Syllabus.

act the state court lost its jurisdiction, and upon the filing of
the record in the Federal court that court acquired jurisdiction. It thereby had the authority to hear, determine and
render a judgment in that case to the exclusion of every other
court. But where the court permitted a dismissal of the action
by the plaintiff it thereby lost the jurisdiction which it had
thus acquired.
We know of no principle which would permit the Federal
court under such circumstances, and after the dismissal of the
suit, to continue its jurisdiction over the case in such wise that
no other court could ever entertain it. After the voluntary
dismissal in the Federal court the case was again at large, and
the plaintiff was at liberty to begin it again in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals of
Georgia, and the same is aiTrmed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 137, Argued March 10, 11, 1910.-Decided April 4, 1910.
In this case both parties claim under Spanish or Mexican titles, confirmed by proceedings under the act of March 3, 1851, c. 41, 9 Stat.
631. The Federal rights alleged by plaintiff in error to have been
violated by the decision of the state court, so far as concerns this
act, relate to the extent of the right and ownership of the parties in
the use of the Los Angeles River. Plaintiff in error contended that
by its grant it became the owner of riptrian rights without limitations by any right of the city of Los Angeles to use the water of the
river, and that the city by failing to present its claim for the use of
such water to the commission under the act of 1851 is foreclosed
from row asserting them. The state court held that the city of
Los Angeles had the exclusive right to the water of the Los Angeles
