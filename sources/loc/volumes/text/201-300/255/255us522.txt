Another assessment on a. small gain realized upon a
purchase, made in 1914, of bonds which were duly called
for redemption and paid in 1917, does not present any
questions other than those which We have discussed and
therefore it does not call for separate consideration.

ELDORADO COAL CO. v. MAGER.
522.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

There is a fundamental difference between a profit
realized on & sale by a merchant or trader in the course
of his business and a gain resulting from an increase in
a capital investment; income arises on the sale in the
case of the merchant, but, in the case of the capital in,
vestment, income arises neither on the sale nor prior
thereto. Hudson's Bay Co. v. Stevens, 5 Tax Cases, 424,
437; Assets Conpany v. Forbes, 3 Tax Cases, 542, 548;
Ex parte Humbird, 114 Maryland, 627, 633.
This court has decided that, in the case of a merchant
in the course of his business, income accrues and is received When he sells for a profit, but that, in the case of
an investor, income does not accrue and is not received
while his capital investment is increasing in value, nor
when the investment is sold. Gray v. Darlington, 15
Wall. 63, 65, 66; Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 229, 230;
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207, 214, 215.
Cases decided by this court under the Corporation
Excise Tax Act of 1909 are not inconsistent with the decisions of this court previously cited.
If increase in the value of an investment accrues as
income during the period of such increase, it cannot become income only when the investment 'is' sold; and if
increase in the value of an investment is capital, and
never, even on a sale of the investment, accrues as income, the increase in value can never be received as. income. Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 229; Gray v.
Darlington, 15 Wall. 63.
An increase in the money value of capital is not realized
as income by a sale or conversion of the capital. The idea
that income is realized by conversion of carital which
has increased in value is evidently due to a confusion of
ideas in two particulars: first, the fact that a merchant
or trader realizes income only when he sells the property
in which he trades suggests the idea that any sale, when
increase in,value has already occurred, must likewise

produce income; second, it has been assumed that an accounting practice in recording capital values was based
on a distinction between capital and income, when in
fact it is not.
Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment
both English and American courts had definitely decided
that the sale of capital investments at an advance over
cost did not produce income. A winding-up sale does
not involve a conversion of two investments, one an investment of the corporation and another an investment
of the stockholders. The authorities sustain the contention that on a winding-up sale by a corporation the
investment sold is the investment of the stockholders,
and that any prior increase in the value of the property
sold was an increase in the value of their investment.
Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 228; Collector v. Hubbard,
12 Wall. 1; Bailey v. RailroadCo., 22 Wall. 604, 635, 636;
Tebrau Rubber Syndicate, Ltd., v. Farmer (1909), 5 Tax
Cases, 658.
The income tax provisions of neither the Act of March
2, 1867, nor the Act of October 3, 1913, imposed any
tax on a realized increase in the value of capital assets.
Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63; Lynch v. Turrish, 247
U. S. 221; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 251
U. S. 342.
The provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917
which define the property on which the income and excess profits Laxes are imposed are substantially the same
as the corresponding provisions of the Acts of 1867 and
1913.
No rulings of the Treasury Department can affect
the duty of the court to give the same interpretation, in
this respect, to the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917 as
to the Acts of 1867 and 1913.
Neither the new provisions of the Revenue Act of
1916 making the March 1, 1913, value the basis for com-

Opinion of the Court.

puting gain or loss "from the sale or other disposition"
of property, nor the new provision in that act with regard to losses of individuals, serve to make the scope of
the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917 any broader, as to
realized increases in the value of capital assets, than the
Act of 1867 or the Act of 1913.
All doubts respecting the scope and meaning of a
tax statute are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.
Gould v. Gould, 245 U. S. 151; Crocker v. Malley, 249
U. S. 223, 233.
A statute must be so construed, if fairly possible, as
not only to avoid the conclusion that it is unconstitutional
but even grave doubts upon that score. United States v.

delivered the opinion of tae court.

This case comes into this court on a writ of error to
review a judgment of the District Court of the United
States for the Northern District of Illinois, sustaining
a demurrer to a declaration in assumpsit to recover an
assessment of income and excess profits taxe for the
year 1,917, under warrant of the Income Ta. Act of
Congress, approved SeptemberL8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat.
756, as amended by the Act approved October 3, 1917,
c. 63, 40 Stat. 300. payment was made under protest
and the claim to recover is basedupon the sam.3 contention dealt with in No. 608, this day decided, ante, 509,
that the fund taxed was not "income" within -le scope
of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, and that the effect given by the lower
court to the act renders it unconstitutional and void.
The Eldorado Coal and Mining Company is an In-

diana corporation, which operated a bituminous coal
mine and mining plant, which it sold in May, 1917, for
cash. The company- retained its accounts receivable
and prior to September 30, 1917 it distributed among
its stockholders, proportionately tq their ownership of
stocks, the cash received from the sale and the accounts
receivable in kind. The corporation, however, was not
dissolved nor its charter surrendered, because there
were unsettled liabilities against it for federal income
taxes and excess profit taxes. Otherwise its affairs were
wound up.
It is averred in the declaration that, taking the fair
market value as of March 1, 1913, of. the capital assets
.of the company invested and employed in its business,
and adding thereto the cost of additions and betterments,
and subtracting depreciation and depletion to the date
of sale, it appears that there was an appreciation in
value of the property after March 1, 1913, of $5,986.02,
and it was on this profit realized by the sale that the
assessment of $3,073.16 was made which the company
paid and in this suit seeks to recover.
It is obvious from this statement of the case that it
presents in so nearly the same form precisely the same
questions as were considered in No. 608, Merchants'
Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, this day decided, ante, 509,
that further discussion of them is unnecessary, and, on
the authority of thit case, the judgment of the District
Court is
Affirmed.

the judgment.
