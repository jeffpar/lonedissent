KINNANE v. 'DETROIT CREAMERY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

against the United States Attorney and the members of
the "Federal Fair Price Committee" for an injunction
to restrain prosecutions against them for selling milk at
alleged unjust and unreasonable rates or charges, in
violation of the fourth section of the Lever Act, as reenacted in 1919, on the ground, among others, that the
section was repugnant to the Constitution because of its
vagueness and because it failed to provide a standard of
criminality.
The United States Attorney, after challenging in his
answer the right to restrain the Performance by him of
his official duties, admitted that in its advisory capacity
the said price committee had fixed what it had deemed
to be a fair price for the sale of milk and that he intended,
in the discharge of his official duty, to act upon such advice as the basis for prosecutions where such price was,
exceeded, and, asserting the constitutionality of the
section and the want of merit in the grounds upon which
it was assailed, prayed the dismissal of the bill.
A temporary injunction issued and, the case having
been submitted on the pleadings without proof, the court,
stating that the sole question inivolved was whether the
provision in question of ยง 4 of the Lever Act was constitutional, decided that it was not, because of its vagueness and uncertainty, and of the consequent absence from
it of all standard of criminality. The enf'rcement of
said provision was therefore permanently ei~joined, and
upon this appeal, the sole issue raised by the Government
is whether the court erred in holding the provision of the
statute in question to be void for repugnancy to the Constitution. That it did not so err, is fully established by
the opinion this day announced in the Cohen Grocery Co.
Case, No. 324, ante, 81, and therefore it is our'duty to
-affirm.

The two other cases, Nos. 377 and 378, are likewise so
controlled. Both were indictments for selling potatoes
