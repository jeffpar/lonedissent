UNITED STATES v. FIELD, EXECUTOR OF FIELD.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 442.

Argued December-9, 1920.-Decided

February 28, 1921.

1. The provisions of laws imposing taxes are not to be extended by
implication. P. 262.
2. The Revenue Act of 1916, § 202, c. 463, 39 Stat. 777, did not impose

an estate tax upon property passing under a testamentary execution
of a general power of appointment. Id.
3. To be taxable under clause (a) of § 202 of the act, the estate must'
be (1) an interest of the decedent at the time of his death, (2) which,
after his death, is subject to the payment of the charges against
his estate and the expenses of administration, and (3) is subject to
distribution as part of his estate; and these conditions are expressed
conjunctively and cannot be construed as disjunctive. Id.
4. A general power of appointment by will does not of itself vest any
estate in the donee of the power. P. 263.
5. In equity, property passing under such a power may be treated as
assets of the donee of the power, distributable to his creditors, but
only when the power has been executed, and executed in favor of a
volunteer, and then only to the extent to which. the donee's own
eqtate is insufficient to pay his debts; and his executor, if he take
the appointed property at all, takes not as executor but as representative of the creditors. Id.
6. In any event, the property subject to such a power is -not subject
to distribution as part of the estate of the donee. P. 264.
7. Clause (b) of § 202 of the act, describing a transfer of an interest
in the decedent's own property in his lifetime, intended to take effect
at or after his death, does not cover a transfer by testamentary
execution of a power of appointment over property not his own.
Id.
8. The fact that in the later Act of February 24, 1919, property passing under a general power of appointment executed by the deceased
was expressly included in the valuation of his estate for taxation,
shows at least a legislative doubt whether the Act of 1916 included
such property. P. 265.
55 Ct. Clms. 430, affirmed.

Argument for the United States.
THE

255 U. S.

case is stated in the opinion.

The Solicitor Generaland Mr. Assistant Attorney General
Davis, with whom Mr. T. K. Schmuck, Special Assistant to

the Attorney General, was on the brief, for the United
States:

The common-law fiction regards the donor of a power as
the source of title to an appointed estate, but the donee's
execution of the power is a transfer of such estate when
such execution is requisite to pass title to the appointees.
Chanter v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466; Luques Appellant, 114
Maine; 235, 340;'Minot v. Treasurer,207 Massachusetts,
588; McFallv. Kirkpatrick,236 Illinois, 281, 306.
It is a well-recognized rule of law that an estate passing
under the executior of a general power of appointment is
subject to the payment of debts of the donee of the power.

The present case is not concerned with maintenance or
disturbance 6f rules of property. The words of the act in
question "distribution as part of his estate," § 202 (a), arewords in common use and are therefore to be given their
popular meaning. A popular interpretation would include
in the estate of a de6eased testatrix property over which
she enjoyed substantially all the incidents of ownership
and of, which she disposed at her death. See House Doc.
No. 1267, p. 101, 65th Cong., 2d sess.
The donee of the power enjoyed the estate during hei
life- and had absolute power of disposal at her death.
Minot v. Treasurer,supra. During her life the estate was

perhaps subject to the lien of judgments against. her.

-Brandiesv. Cochrane,supra, commenting on c. 77, §§ 1 and
3, Hurd's Illinois Revised Statutes, 1917. It was she
whose act "turned the course of ownership," by whose
act alone any future interest could be brought into existence. McFall v. Kirkpatrick, upra. *On execution of her
power the appointed estate became liable for her debts;
and it has been suggested that such an estate is liable
therefor though the donee do not execute the power.

executors were entitled to administer the appointed estate
as part of her assets. Olney v. Balch, 154 Massachusetts,

the purposes of registration acts and within the meaning of

Mr. John P. Wilson, with whom Mr. William B.-Hale
and Mr. Walter Bruce Howe were on the brief, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Claims sustaining a claim for refund of an estate tax
exacted under Title II of the Revenue Act of September 8,
1916, as amended by Act of March 3, 1917 (c. 463, 39
Stat. 756, 777; c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000, 1002). It presents
the question whether the act taxed a certain interest that
passed under testamentary execution of a general power
of appointment created prior but executed subsequent to,
its passage.

The facts are as follows: Joseph N. Field, a citizen and
resident of Illinois, died April 29, 1914, leaving a will which
was duly admitted to probate in tb State, and by which
he gave the residue of his Qstate, after payment of oertaiai

legacies, to trustees, with provision that one-third of it
should be set apart and held as a separate trust fund for
the benefit of -his-wife,. Kate Field, the net income to be
paid to.her during life, and from and after her death the
net income of one-half of said share of the trust estate to
bb paid to such.persons and in.
such shares as she should
appoint by last-will and teatament. The trust was to continue until the death of the last surviving grandchiId of the
testator who was living at the time of his death, and at its
termination the undistributed estate wa to be divided
among named beneficiaries or their issue, 'per tirpes, in
proportions specified. Kate Field died April 29, 1917, a
resident of Illinois, leaving a will which was duly probated
ir, that.State, by which she executed the power -ofappointment, directing that the income to which the pbwer related
shoulc be paid in equal shares to her children surviving at
the date of the respective payments, the issue of any deceased child to stand in the place of such deceased child.
The collector of internal revenue, assuming to act under
the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended, and Regulations
issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, included as a part of the gross estate of Kate Field the
appointed estate passing under her execution of the
power; and proceeded to 'assess and collect. an estate
tax based upon the net value thereof, and amounting to
$121,059.60. Her executor, having paid the tax under
protest, and having made 'a claim for refund which was
considered and rejected by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, brought this suit and recovered judgment, from
which the United States appeals.
The'Reyenue Act of 1916, in § 201 (39 Stat. 777), imposes a tax equal to specified percentages of the value of
the net estate "upon the transfer of the net estate of every
decedent dying after the passage of this Act." By § 203
(p*. 778) the value of the net estate is to be determined by
subtracting from the value of the gross estate certain

specified deductions. The gross estate is to be valued
as follows:
"Sec. 202. That the value of the gross estate of the
decedent shall be determined by including the value at the
time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible
or intangible, wherever situated:
"(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and
the expenses of its administration and is subject to distribution as part of his estate.
"(b) To the extent of any interest therein of which the
decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect
to which he has created a trust, in contemplation cf or
intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment'at or
after his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair
consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of
a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent
within two years prior to his death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed
to have been made in contemplation of death within the
meaning of this title; .
The amendment of March 3, 1917, (39 Stat. 1002), pertains merely to the rates, and need not be further considered. 1
The provision quoted from § 202 was construed by the
Treasury Department, in U. S. Internal Revenue Regulations No. 37, relating to Estate Taxes, revised May, 1917,
Art. XI, as follows: "PrQperty passing under a general
pover of appointment is to be included as a portion of the
gross estate of a decedent appointor."
No question being suggested asto the power of Congress
The act was further amended October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300,
*324; superseded and repealed by Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40
Stat. 1057, 1096, 1149.

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

to impose a tax upon the passing of property under testamentary execution of a power of appointment created
before but executed after the passage of the taxing act
(see Chan/erv. Kelsey, 205 U. -S. 466, 473, 478-479; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 56-61), the case involves merely
a question of the construction of the act. Applying the
accepted canon that the provisions of such acts are not to
be extended by implicalion (Gould v. Gould, 245 U. S. 151,
153), we are constrained to the view-notwithstanding
the administrative construction adopted by the Treasury
Department-that the Revenue Act of 1916 did not
impose, an estate tax upon property passing under a
testamentary execution of a general power of appointment.
The Government seeks to sustain the tax under both
clauses above quoted from § 202.
The conditions expressed in clause (a) are to the effect
that the taxable estate must be (1) an interest of the decedent at the time of his death, (2) which after his death is
subject to the payment of the charges against his estate
and the expenses of its administration, and (3) is subject to
distribution as part of his estate. These conditions :are
expressed conjunctively; and it would be inadmissible, in
construing a taxing act, to read them as if prescribed
disjunctively. Hence, unless the appointed interest fulfilled all three conditions, it was not taxable under this
clause.
The chief reliance of the Government is upon the rule,
well established in England and followed geneially, but
not universally, in this country, that where one has a
general power of appointment either by deed or by will,
and executes the power, equity' will regard the property
appointed as part of his assets for the payment of his
creditors in preference to the claims of his voluntary
appointees. See Brandies v. Cochrane, 112 U. S. 344,
352.

UNITED STATES v. FIELD.
257.

Opinion of thb Court.

The English cases are fully reviewed by the House of
Lords in O'Grady v. Wilmot [1916] 2 A. C. 231, 246, et seq.
Illustrative, cases in the American courts are Johnson v.
Cushing, 15 N. H. 298, 307; Rogers v. Hinton, 62 N. Car.
101, 105; Clapp v. Ingraham,126 Massachusetts, 200, 202;
Knowles v. Dodge, 1 Mack. (D. C.) 66, 72; Freeman v.
Butters, 94 Virginia, 406, 411; Tallmadge v. Sill, 21 Barb.
34, 51, et seq.; contra,per Gibson, C. J., in Commonwealth v.
Duffield, 12 Pa. St. 277, 279-281; Pearce v. Lederer, 262
Fed. Rep. 993; affirmed, Lederer v. Pearce, 266 Fed. Rep.
497.
It is tacitly admitted that the rule obtains in Illinois,
and we shall so assume.
But the existence of the power does not of itself vest any
estate in the donee. Collins v. Wickwire, 162 Massachusetts, 143, 144; Keays v. Blinn, 234 Illinois, 121, 124;
Walker v. Treasurer, 221 Massachusetts, 600, 602-603;
Shattuck v. Burrage, 229 Massachusetts, 448, 451. See
Carver v. Jackson, 4 Pet. 1, 93.
Where the donee dies indebted, having executed the
power in favor of volunteers, the appointed property is
treated as equitable, 'not legal, assets of his estate; Clapp
v. Ingraham, 126 Massachusetts, 200, 203; Patterson& Co.
v. Lawrence, 83 Georgia, 703, 707; and (in the absence of
statute), if it passes to the executor at all, it does so not by
virtue of his office but as a matter of convenience and because he represents the rights of creditors. O'Grady v.
Wilmot [1916] 2 A. C. 231, 248-257; Smith v. Garey, 2
Dev. &.Bat.%Eq. (N. C.) 42, 49; Olney v. Balch, 154 Massachusetts, 318, 322; Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Massachusetts,
410, 411; Hill v. Treasurer, 229 Massachusetts, 474,
477.
Where the power is executed, creditors of the donee can
lay claim to the appointed estate only to the extent that
the donee's own estate is insufficient to satisfy their de mands. Patterson& Co. v. Lawrence, 83 Georgia, 703, 708'

Opinion of the CQurt.

255 U. S.

Walker v. Treasurer, 221 MassAchusetts, 600, 602-603;
Shattuck v. Burrage, 229 Massachusetts, 448, 452.
It is settled that (in the absence of statute). creditors
have no redress in case of a failure to execute the power.
Holmes v. Coghill, 7 Ves. 499, 507, affirmed, 12 Ves. 206,
214-215; Gilman v. Bell, 99 Illinois, 144, 150; Duncansonv.
Manson, 3 App. D. C. 260, 273.
And, whether the power be or be not exercised, the property that was subject to appointment is not subject to distribution as part of. the estate of the donee. If there be no
appointment, it goes according to the disposition of the
donor. If there be an appointment to volunteers, then,
subject to whatever charge creditors may have against it,
it goes not to the next of kin or the legatees of the donee,
but to his appointees under the power.
It follows that the interest in question, not having been
property bf Mrs. Field at the time of her death, nor subject
to distribution as part of her estate, was not taxable under
clause (a-).,
We deem it equally clear that it was not within clause
(b). That clause is the complement of (a), and is aptly
descriptive of a transfer of an intereft in decedent's own
property in his lifetime, intended to -take effect at or after
his death. It cannot, without undue laxity of construction,
be made to cover a transfer resulting from a testamentary
execution by decedent of a power of appointment over
property not his own.
It would have been easy for Congress to express a purpose to tax property passing under a general power of
'appointment exercised by a decedent had such a purpose
existed; and none was expressed in the act under consideration. In that, of February 24, 1919, which took its place,
the-section providing how the value of the gross estate of
the 'decedent shall be determined contains a clause precisely to the point [§ 402 (e), 40 Stat. 10971: "To the extent of any property passing under a general power of

UNITED STATES v. FIELD.
257.

Opinion of the Court.

appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or
(2) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to
take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his
death, except," etc. Its insertion indicates that Congress
at least was doubtful whether the previous act included
property passing by appointment. See Matter of Miller,
110 N. Y. 216, 222; Matter of Harbeck, 161 N. Y. 211,
217-218; United States v. Bashaw, 50 Fed. Rep. 749, 754.
The Government contends that the amendment was made
for the purpose of clarifying rather than extending the law
as it stood, and cites a statement to that effect in the
Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means
(House Doc. No. 1267, p. 101, 65th Cong., 2d sess.). It is
evident, however, that this statement was based upon the
interpretation of the Act of 1916 adopted by the Treasury
Department; the same report proceeded to declare (p. 102)
that "The absence of a provision including property
transferred by power of appointment makes it possible, by
resorting to the creation of such a power, to effect two
transfers of an estate with the payment of only one tax;"
and this, together with the fact that the committee proposed that the law be amended, shows that the Treasury
construction was not treated as a safe reliance.
The tax in question being unsupported by the taxing
act, the Court of Claims was right in awarding reimbursement.
Judgment affirmed.
