District of Columbia, a person claiming that'an order of the commission raising the rates of a gas company infringes his constitutional
rights need not make complaint or appear before the commission

2. An order of the commission, raising the rates chargeable by a gas
company to private consumers in the District of Columbia without
'changing a lower and unremunerative rate fixed by act of Congress

involve any unconstitutional discrimination against private consumers, or taking of their property without due process of law, since
the United States may fix any rate, for itself and for the District,
as a condition to the gas company's establishment in the District,
and private consumers are not' compelled to purchase gas. P. 454.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. F. H. Stephens, with whom Mr. Conrad H. Syme
was on the brief, for Public Utilities Commission.
Mr. Benjamin S. Minor, with whom Mr. H. Prescott
Gatley and Mr. Hugh B. Rowland were on the brief, for
Washington Gas Light Company, appellee.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is a bill in equity brought by private consumers of
gas to have two orders of the Public Utilities Commission
that increase the rate for gas to private consumers declared
void. The first order, Number 254, March 15, 1918, raised
the rate from 75 cents per thousand feet to 90 cents. The
second, No. 314, March 15, 1919, raised it to not exceeding
95 cents; the orders being made under the authority of tjie
Act of March 4, 1913, c. 150, ยง 8, 37 Stat. 938, 974, et 8eq.,
establishing the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia and fixing its powers. The bill and the
appeal to this Court are said to be based upon Par. 64, of
ยง 8, 37 Stat. 988. It is alleged that the orders violate the
plaintiffs' constitutional rights because the rate t6 be
charged to the United States and to the District remains
the statutory rate of 70 cents, and to certain other takers
still less, and that if the United States and District had
paid 90 cents for the year 1918 the Gas Company would
have received a return of about six per cent. It is said that
the difference is an unlawful -discrimination and that the
plaintiffs are required to make up the loss- incurred by
furnishing the gas to the Government and the District at
less than cost. The bill was dismissed by the Supreme
Court for want of equity and because not filed within one
hundred and twenty days after the entry of the order of
March 15, 1918, as required by ยง 8, Par. 65. The Court of
Appeals affirmed the decree on the different ground that

a-formal complaint and hearing before the Commission
were a condition of the right to sue in the courts. The
provision in Par. 67 for the transmission of any new evidence taken in the suit to the Commission for its further
consideration, and other details, were thought to indicate
that the suit was in the nature of an appeal.
We are unable to agree with the opinion of the Court of
Appeals. Assuming that the bill is based upon the statute
the language of Par. 64 is that any person interested and
-dissatisfied with any order fixing any rate may commence
a proceeding in equity. We do not perceive any advaritage in requiring a party to file a complaint asking the
Commission to review a decision just reached by it after a
public hearing, nor do we see such a requirement in the
statute. On the other hand we'see no requirement that the
plaintiffs in equity should have appeared.-in the original
hearing upon the rate. They are parties to the order
equally whether they saw fit to argue the case to the
.Commission or not, and when they stand upon supposed
constitutional rights there seems to be no necessity of
raising the point until they get into Court. This suit
is not for a revision of details but for a decree that the
orders are void as matter of law. That by reason of their
pecuniary interest the plaintiffs are persons interested
within the statute, may be assumed for the purposes of
decision. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh,
222 U. S. 42,49. S. C. Peavey & Co. v. Union Pacific R. R.
Co., 176 Fed. Rep. 409, 416, 417. See Detroit & Mackinac
Ry. Co. v. Michigan R. R. Commission, 235 U. S. 402.
On the merits however there is no doubt that the decree
was right. We do not wish to belittle the claim of a taker
of what for the time has become pretty nearly a necessity to
equal treatment while gas is furnished to the public. But
the notion that the Government cannot make it a condition of allowing thc establishment of gas works that its
needs and the needs of its instrument the District shall be

satisfied at any price that it may fix strikes us as needing
no answer. The plaintiffs are under no legal obligation to
take gas nor is the Government bound to allow it to be
furnished. If they choose to take it the plaintiffs must
submit to such enhancement of price, if any, as is assignable to the Government's demands. We do not consider
whether the Commission has power to raise the price to the
excepted class because, even if it has, the plaintiffs have no
right to require equality with the Government and they
have no other ground upon which to found their supposed
right.
Decree affirmed.

YORK CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY.,
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK.
Nc. 290.

Argued March 1,'1921.-Decided March 28, 192i.

1. Failure of a railroad to equip a car with automatic couplers as
required by the Safety Appliance Act will not render it liable to
an employee for an injury of which the delinquency was not the
proximate cause. P. 458.
2. Where a brakeman, whose duty and purpose were to stop a string
of switched cars before they reached a car standing on a siding awaiting unloading, was injured in a collision with it, having failed to
stop the moving cars in time, held, that the fact that the standing
car lacked a draw bar and coupler on the end where the impact
was did not render the railroad liable for the injury, even if their
presence would have prevented it, since the purpose of the requiremen' of automatic couplers is to avoid risks in coupling and not to
provide a place of safety between colliding cars. P. 459.
