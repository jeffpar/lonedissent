WALSH v. BREWSTER..
536.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. H. Edgar Barnes, by leave of court, filed a brief as
amicus curim.
MR.

JusTicE CIARiKE delivered the opinion of the

court.
In this case the defendant in error sued the plaintiff in
error, a collector of Internal Revenue, to recover income
'taxes for the year 1916, assessed in 1918, and which were
paid under protest to avoid penalties. The defendant
answered,, the case was tried upon an agreed statement of
facts, and judgment was rendered in favor of the taxpayer,
the defendant in error. The case is properly here by writ
of error. Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418.
The defendant in error was not a trader or dealer in
stocks or bonds, but occasionally purchased and sold one
or the other for the purpose of changing his investments.
Three transactions are involved.
The first relates to bonds of the International Navigation Company, purchased in 1899, for $191,000, and sold in
1916 for the same amount. The market value of these bonds
on March 1, 1913, was $151,845, and the tax in dispute
was assessed on the difference between this amount and the
amount for which they were sold in 1916, viz, $39,155.
The trial court held that this apparent gain was capital
assets and not taxable income under the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant in error for the
amount of the tax which he had paid.
The ground upon which this part of the judgment was
justified below is held to be erroneous in No. 608, Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smiedanka, this day decided,
ante, 509, but, since the owner of the stock did not realize
any gain on his original investment by the sale in 1916,.
the judgment was right in this respect, and under authority
of the opinion and judgment in No. 663, Goodrich v. Ed-

255 U. S.

wards, also rendered this day, ante, 527, this part of the
judgment is affirmed.
The second transaction involved the purchase in 1902
and 103 of bonds of the International Mercantile Marine
Company for $231,300, which were sold in 1916 for
$276,150. This purchase was madd through 'an underwriting agreement such that the purchaser did not receive
any interest upon the amount paid prior to the allotment
to him of the bonds in 1906, and he claimd that interest
upon the investment for the time which so elapsed should
be added as a part of the cost to him of the bonds. But
this claim was properly rejected by the trial court under authority of Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189.
. It is stipulated that the market value of these bonds on
March 1, 1913, was $164,480, and the collector assessed
the tax upon the difference between the selling price and
this amount, but since the gain to the taxpayer was only
the difference between his investment of $231,300 and the
amount realized by the sale, $276,150, under authority of
No. 663, Goodrich v. Edwards, this day decided, he was
taxable only on $44,850.
The District Court, however, held that any gain realized
by the sale was a mere conversion of capital assets and was
not income which could lawfully be taxed. In this respect
the court fell into error. The tax was properly assessed,
but only upon the difference between the purchase and
selling price of the bonds as stated.
The third transaction related to stock in the Standard
Oil Company of California, received through the same
stock dividend involved in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S.

189. The District Court, upon authority of that case,
properly held that the assessment made and collected upon
this dividend should be refunded to the defendant in error.
It results that as to the profit realized upon the second
transaction, as ,indicated in this opinioni, the judgment of
the District Court is reversed, but as to the other transac-

APPEALS FROM TH

DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.
Nos. 180, 189, 190. Argued January 26. 28, 1921.-Decided April 11, 1921.

I. In the absence of a contract obligation, the grantee of a franchise
to supply the public with electricity or gas cannot constitutionally
be required by the State or its agencies to observe rates which, in.
effect, are confiscatory of its property. P. 541.
2. The acceptance from a municipality of a franchise to supply the
public with gas or electricity for a term of years at specified maximum,
rates does not bind the grantee with a contractual obligation to.
charge no more if the rates become in effect confiscatory, where
the law of the State (Iowa Code of 1897, §§ 720,, 725) reposes in
the municipality the continuipg power to regulate such rates and,
that the public may be protected from improvident bargains, forbids any abridgment of the power by ordinance, resolution or conotract. P. 542.
