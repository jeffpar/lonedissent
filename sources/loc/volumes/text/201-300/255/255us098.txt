Decided on the authority of United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., ante,
81.
Affirmed.

BILL to enjoin institution of criminal prosecutions
against dealers in wearing apparel, under ยง 4 of the Food
Control Act.,
The Solicitor General, for appellant, in addition to the
points made iri the principal case, ante, 81, contended:
A controversy as to the proper construction of a criminal statute does not authorize an injunction against
prosecutions under that statute.
The exclusion from the act of farm products in the
hands of the producer is not an arbitrary and unconstitutional classification.
The penalties provided are not so unusual, excessive,
cruel and drastic as to be unconstitutional.
Mr. Charles E. Hughes and Mr. Clayton C. Dorsey,
with whom Mr. Gerald Hughes was on the brief, for appellees.
Mr. William D. Guthrie, Mr. Benjamin F. ,Spellman
and Mr. Bernard Hershkopf, by leave of court, filed a
brief as amici curim.

TEDROW v. LEWIS & SON CO.
98.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Win. A. Glasgow, Jr., and Mr. Louis 0. Van Doren,

by leave of court, filed a brief as amici curim.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of

the court.
Various dealers in wearing apparel in the City of Denver filed their bill to enjoin the United States Attorney
from instituting prosecutions against them under ยง 4 of
the Lever Act on the ground that Congress had no power
to adopt that section because a state of peace prevailed,
or, if a state of war existed, the regulation of the price for
which wearing apparel should be sold was beyond the
authority of Congress, and for the further reason that
the section in question was void for repugnancy to the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution because
of its vagueness, want of standard, and denial of the equal
protection of the laws. The case was submitted on bill
and answer and the statute was held void because of its
uncertainty and want of standard, and its enforcement
was enjoined.
That the court was right in this ruling, which is the subject now before us upon direct appeal brought by the
Government, is not open in view of the decision this day
in the Cohen Grocery Co. Case, ante, .81, and, for the reasons stated in that case, it is affirmed.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY

and MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS con-:

cur in the result.
MR. JUSTICE DAY took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
