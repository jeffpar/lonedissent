MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of

the court.
The plaintiff in error is here to reverse a verdict and
sentence against it on an indictment containing four
counts charging it with four separate violations of the
fourth section of the Lever Act. At the close of all the
testimony it requested the court to charge the jury that
the provisions of that section relied upon were repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States, on the grounds,
among others, which were held to be sound in the Cohen
Grocery Co. Case, this day decided, ante, 81.

It is therefore unnecessary for us to do more than to
apply to this case the rulings made in the Cohen Case,
and, in consequence of doing so, to reverse the judgment

No. 558.

Argued October 19, 20, 1920.-Decided February 28, 1921.

to exact "excessive prices."

for wearing apparel, and, in furtherance of the conk
spiracy, of putting on sale in a store various articles of
clothing at prices varying from 110 to 194 per cent. in
advance of cost; and also of making sales of various
suits of clothes at unreasonable prices.
