NEW- ORLEANS LAND COMPANY v. LEADER
REALTY COMPANY, LTD.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 152.

Argued January 18, 1921.-Decided February 28, 1921.

In a suit against New Orleans, where jurisdiction rested on diverse
citizenship, the District Court, through-a receiver, sold certain land
to satisfy a money judgment previously recovered by the plaintiff
against the city on cetain drainage warrants, the sale being'decreed
upon the ground that under acts of Louisiana the city held the land
in trust to secure such warrants.

Held, that the proceeding was

not in ren, passed only such title as the city had, and afforded no
basis for ancillary jurisdiction of a suit in the same court to protect
the title sold against a later judgment of the state courts which

adjudged it inferior to another title, derived by independent grant
from the State, whose holder and its predecessors were not parties
to the receivership proceedings.

Affirmed.
THIS was a direct appeal from a decree of the District
Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, dismissing for want
of jurisdiction a bill to restrain enforcement of. a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State. In addition to
the decisions 'cited in the opinion, see Peake V. New Orleans (1889), 38 Fed. Rep. 779; S. C., 139 U. S. 342; New
Orleans v. Peake (C. C. A. 1892), 52 Fed. Rep. 74, the
latter being in the case in which the receiver's sale occurred. The case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Charles Louque, with whom Mr. W. 0. Hart was
on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. William Winans Wall and_ Mr. Gustave Lemle, for
appellee, submitted. Mr. Johnston Armstrong was also
on the brief.

NEW ORLEANS LAND CO. v. LEADER REALTY CO. 267
266.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTCE McREYNOLDs delivered the opinion of
the court.
Having recovered a judgment upon certain drainage
warrants issued under Act No. 30, 1871, James W. Peake
of New York instituted a second suit in the United States
Circuit Court, Eastern District of Louisiana-May 30,
1891-against New Orleans, seeking sale of land which
that city held as trustee to secure all such warrants.
See Peake v. New Orleans (1891), 139 U. S. 342. Neither
the appellee nor any of its predecessors in interest was
party to the proceeding. By direction of the court a duly
appointed Receiver sold the land-January 15, 1892to Dr. Gaudet, who shortly thereafter transferred it to
appellant, a Louisiana corporation, which took immediate
possession.
Setting up superior title to some of the land under
patent from the State issued June 3, 1874, appellee, also
a Louisiana corporation, brought suit against appellant
in the state court, December 8, 1909, and obtained a
favorable judgment, afterwards affirmed by the Supreme
Court. Leader Realty Co. v. New Orleans Land Co., 142
Louisiana, 169. Thereupon, appellant began this proceeding to restrain enforcement of the judgment of the state
court, or interference with its possession, and alleged that
the District Court's jurisdiction was invoked 3olely in
aid of the decree for sale in Peake v. New Orleans: No
diversity of citizenship existed, and deeming the bill
not ancillary but original the court below dismissed it
for want of jurisdiction.
"The rule is well settled that a sale of real estate under
judicial proceedings concludes no one who is not in some
form a party to such proceedings." Pittsburgh &c. Ry.
Co. v. Long Island Loan & Trust Co., 172 U. S. 493, , 515.
Clearly, Peake v. New Orleans (1891) was not a proceeding
in rem, to which all persons having an interest in the land

were deemed parties with the right to intervene.
Its only
purpose was to secure sale and transfer of such right and
title as the city held. Rights of third parties were not
subject to adjudication therein. High on Receivers,
4th ed., ยง 199a. The subsequent action by the state
court did not interfere with anything done by the federal
court-Dupasseur v. Rochereau, 21 Wall. 130, 136, 137and the relief now sought by appellant is not necessary
to protect or render effectual any former decree. Julian
v. Central'Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93, and similar cases are
not pertinent. Their purpose was to protect or enforce
some right theretofore duly adjudicated while here the
defendant's claim in' no way conflicts with any right arising under the former adjudication, and nothing is required
in order to render that effectual.
The decree below is
Affirmed.
