the lieu selection was lawfully made, it suffices to say,,
following the recent decision in Payne v. Central Pacific
Ry. Co., ante, 228, that the Act of. 1910, under which
the withdrawal was made, is confined to "public lands,"
that by the-selection this land had ceased to be public,
and that the act could not be construed to embrace it
without working an inadmissible interference with vested
rights.
It- results that the Secretary erred in matter of law in
rejecting the selection and that the District Court rightly
entered a decree for the defendants. See Cornelius v.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

.Mr. Albert M. Kales, with whom Mr. Walter L. Fisher
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Assuming that the Income Tax Act of 1916, as amended
by the Act of 1917, attempted to tax as income the increase in value since March 1, -1913, or date of purchase
subsequent to that time, of the stock and bonds in question upon the ascertainment of the increment of value

by conversion or redemption, the act was in violation
of the Constitution.

In accordance with the statement of this court in
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206, it is now settled

that the mere increase in the value of capital assets, prior
to any co nversion or redemption, -is not "income "within
the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.

Gray v. Dar-

lingq(on, 15 Wall. 63, 66; Lynch v. Turrih, 247 U. S. 221,
231.
The conversion by the trustee does not cause the increase in the value of capital assets to be "income," for
the reason that the increase after the single isolated

event bf conversion still remains capital just the same
as it was before. The increase after conversion remaied
a mer6 "gain' accruing to capital," or ".a growth'or increment of value in the inv-estment." The 6hange in form

The conversion and redemption in the case at bar do

trust estate to be income because the gain or increae has
not been "derived," that is, received or drawn bythe
recipient (the taxpayer) for his- sparat6 use;: benefit .and

In the case of a trustee who converts a capital asset
which he has received by devise, there can be no profit
or gain upon which to base any claim of income.:
Even, however,. where the legal and beneficial owner
of capital assets sells them at a profit as a singleieolated
transaction (he not being in any sense in the business Of
buying and selling for profit), the gain is not income
within the Sixteenth Amendment. 'Eisner v. Macomber,

The gains in the value of the capital assets of a legal

(a) or (c).
The act in particular contains no provision for the
taxation of any increase in value of the capital assets of
a trust estate held for life tenant and remainderman ascertained on conversion as a single isolated event.
The Solicitor General for defendant in error:
Assuming that the act treats gains derived by an
individual from the sale of property as taxable income,
it clearly provides for a tax to be paid by a trustee under
the facts of this case.
The act clearly treats as taxable income any gain
which is derived from the sale of property; that is, the
conversion of capital assets.
Gains derived from" the conversion of capital assets
constitute income which Congress may constitutignally

Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, 231 U. S. 399, 415;
Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179, 183, 185.
Ever since the passage of the Act of 1909, the administrative department of the Government has construed
the word "income " as including profits derived from the
conversion of capital assets. 'This construction was
expressly approved by this court in 1918, and millions
of dollars of taxes have been collected both under the
Act of 1909 and the subsequent income tax laws on that
basis. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179, 185188.
Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, is not authority for
the contention that profits derived from the sale of
capital assets are not income. Hays v. Gauley Mountain
Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189, 191; Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S.
221, 227, 230; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., supra; Uhited
States v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry.
Co., 247 U. S. 195; Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247
U. S. 330, 334; Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339.
The fact that under the laws of most of the States
gains derived from the' profitable sale of capital assets
are, as between life tenant and remainderman, treated
as principal and not as income, can not operate to prevent
such gains being income when clearly included in the
definition of income as adopted by an act of Congress.
Neither is there any constitutional difficulty because
Congress has seen fit to tax all of such gains in the year
in which they are received.
When capital assets are converted into cash, and the
original capital is withdrawn from the proceeds, the income remains segregated and subject to separate use..
Eisner v. Macomber, supra, 211, 213.
The gains received by a trustee under a will by the
profitable sale of capital assets purchased by the testator
in his lifetime, are measured in precisely the same way

they would have been measured if the latter had lived
and made the sale himself.
- he question as to whether there is income in the sale
of property at a loss as compared with its cost prior to
1913, but at an advance over its value on March 1, 1913,
is not now involved.
Mn. JusTIcE CLARxK delivered the opinion of the court.

A writ of error brings this case here for review of a judgment of the District Court of the United States -for the
Northern District of Illinois, sustaining a demurrer to a
dcclaration in assumpsit to recover an assessment of taxes
for the year 1917, made under warrant of the Income Tax
Act of Congress, approved September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39
Stat. 756, as amended by the Act approved October 3, 1917,
c. 63, 40 Stat. 300. Payment was made under protest and
the claim to recover is based upon the contention that the
fund taxed was not "income" within the scope of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States and that the effect given by the lower court to the
act of Congress cited renders it umconstitutional and void.
This is sufficient to sustain the writ of error. Tomne v.
Eime'r, 24U. S.418.
Arthur.Ryerson died in 1912, and the plaintiff in error is
trustee under his will, of property the net income of which
was directed to be paid to his widow during her life and
after her duath to be used for the benefit of his children, or
their, representatives, until each child should arrive at,
twenty-five years of age, when each should receive his or
her share of the trust fund.
The trustee was given the fullest.possible dominion over
the trust estate. It was made the final judge as to what
"net income" of the estate should be, and its determination in this respect was made binding upon all parties
interested therein, "except that it is my will that stock

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA.
5W9.

515

Opinion of the Court.

dividends and accretions of selling values shall be considered principal and not income."
The widow and four children were living in 1917.
Among the assets which came to the custody of the
trustee were 9,522 shares of the capital stock of Joseph T.
Ryerson & Son, a corporation. It is averred that the cash
value of these shares, on March 1, 1913, was $561,798, and
that they were sold for $1,280,996.64, on February 2, 1917.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated the difference between the value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and
the amount for which it was sold on February 2, 1917, as
income for the year 1917, and upon that amount assessed
the tax which was paid. No question is made as. to the
amount of the tax if the collection of it was lawful.
The ground of the protest, and the argument for the
plaintiff in error here, is that the sum charged as" income"
represented appreciation in the value of the capital assets
of the estate which was not "income" within the meaning
of the Sixteenth Amendment and therefore could not,
constitutionally, be taxed, without apportionment, as
required by § 2, el. 3, and by § 9, cl. 4, of Article I of the
Constitution of the United States.
It is first argued that the increase in value of the stock
could not be lawfully taxed under the act of Congress because it was not income to the widow, for she did not
receive it in 1917, and never can receive it, that it was not
income in that year to the children for they did not then,
and may never, receive it, and that it was not income to
the trustee, not only because the will creating the trust
required that "stock dividends and accretions of selling
values shall be considered principal and not income," but
also because in the "common understanding" tFe term
"income" does not comprehend such a gain or profit as we
have here, which it is contended is really an accretion to
capital and therefore not constitutionally taxable under
Eisnerv. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189.

516

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

The provision of the will may be disregarded. It was
not within the power of the testator to render the fund
non-taxable.
Assuming for the present that there was constitutional
power to tax such a gain or profit as is here involved, are
the terms of the statute comprehensive enough to include it?
Section 2 (a) of the Act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat.
757; 40 Stat. 300, 307, § 212), applicable to the case, defines the income of "a taxable person" as including
"gains, profits and income derived from . . . sales,
or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing
out of the ownership or use of or interest in real or peror gains or' profits and income
.
.
sonal property,
derived from any.source whatever."
Plainly the gain we are considering was derived from the
sale of personal property, and, very certainly the comprehensive last clause "gains or profits and income derived
from any source whatever," must also include it, if the
trustee was a "taxable person" within the meaning of the
act when the assessment was made.
That the trustee was Such a "taxable person" is clear
from § 1204 (1) (c) of the Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,
40 Stat. 331, which requires that "trustees, executors
.:.. and all persons, corporations, or associations,
acting in any fiduciary capacity, shall make and render a
return of the income of the person, trust, or estate for
whom or which theyact, and be subject to all the provisions of this title which apply to individuals."
And-§ 2 (b) of the Act of September 8, 1916, supra,specifically declares that the "income received by estates of
deceased persons during the period of administration or
settlement of the estate, . . . or any kind of property
held intrust, including such income accumulated in trust
for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons, or
persons, with contingent interests, and income held for

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA.
509.

Opinion of the Court.

future distribution under the terms of the will or trust
shall be likewise taxed, the tax in each instance, excopt
when the income is returned for the purpose of the tax by
the beneficiary, to be assessed to the executor, admidstrator, or trustee, as the case may be."
Further, § 2 (c) clearly shows that it was the purpose of
Congress to tax gains, derived from such a sale as we have
here, in the manner in which this fund was assessed, by
providing that "for the purpose of ascertaining the gain
derived from the sale or other disposition of property, real,
personal, or mixed, acquired before March first, nineteen
hundred and thirteen, -the fair market price or value of
such property as of March first, nineteen hundred and
thirteen, shall be the basis for determining the amdunt
of such gain derived."
Thus, it is the plainly expressed purpose of the act of
Congress to treat such a trustee as we have here as a
"taxable person" and for the purposes of the act to deal
with the income received for others precisely as if the
beneficiaries had received it in person.
There remains the question, strenuously argued,
whether this gain in four years of over $700,000 on an
investment of about $500,000 is "income" within the
meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.
The question is one of definition and the answer to it
may be found in recent decisions of this court.
The Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909,
c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, was not an income tax law, but a
definition of the word "income" was so necessary ' its
administration that in an early case it was formulat ,d as
"the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both
combined." Straon's Independnce v. Howbert, 231 U. S.
399, 415.
This definition, frequently approved by this court, received an addition, in its latest income tax decision, which

518

OCTOBER TERM, 192D
Opinion ofthe Court.

255 U .8.

is especially significant in its application, to such a case as
we have here, so that it now reads: ."'Income may be
defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or
from both combined,' provided it be understood to include
profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets.':
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207.
The use made of this definition of "income" in the decision of cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax
Act of August 5, 1909, and under the Income Tax Acts is,
we think, decisive of the -case before us. Thus, in two
cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act:
In Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189,, a
coal company, without corporate authority to trade in
stocks, purchased shares in another coal mining company
in 1902, which -itsold in 1911, realizing a profit of $210,000.
Over the same objection made in this case, that the fund
wasmerely converted capital, this court held that so much
of the profit upon the Wle of the stock as accrued subsequent to the effective date of the act was properly treated
as income received during 1911, in assessing the tax for
that year.
In United States v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &
St. Louis Ry. Co., 247 U. S. 195, arailroad company purchased shares of stock in another railroad company in 1900
which it sold in 1909, realizing a profit of $814,000. 'Here,
again, over the same objection, this court held that the
part of the profit which accrued subsequent-to the effective
date of the act was properly treated as income received
during the year 1909 for the purposes of the act.
Thus, from the price realized. from the sale of stock by
two investors, as distinguished from. dealers, and from, a
single transaction as distinguished from a course of business; the value of the stock on the effective date of the tax
act was deducted and the resulting gain was treated by
this court as "incomeP' by which the tax was measured.
It is obvious that these decisions.in principle, rule the

Opinion of the Court.

case at bar if the word "income" has the same meaning in
the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation
Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of
meaning was in effect decided in 8outhern Pacific Co. v.
Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 335; where it was assumed for the
purposes of decision that there was no difference in. its
meaning as used in the Act of 1909 and in the Income Tax
Act of 1913. There can be no doubt that the word must be
given the same meaning and content in the Income Tax
Acts of 1916 and 1917 that it had in the Act of 1913.
When to this we add that in Eier v. Macomber, eupra, a
case arising under the same Income Tax Act of 1916 which
is here involved, the definition of "income" which was
applied was adopted from Stratton'sIndependence v. Howbert, 8upra, arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act
of 1909, with the addition that it should include "profit
j;ained through a sale or conversion of capital assets,"
there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word
must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax
Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation.
Excise Tax Act and that what that meaning is has now
become definitely settled by decisions of this court.
In determining the definition of the word "income"
thus arrived at, this court has consistently refused to
enter into the refinements of lexicographers or economists
and has approved, in the definitions quoted, What it
believed to. be the commonly understood meaning of
the term which must have been in the minds of the
people when they adopted the Sixteenth Amendment
to the Constitution. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co.,, 247
U. S. 179, 185; Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206,
207. Notwithstanding the full argument heard in this
- -ease and in the series of cases now under consideration
we* continue entirely satisfied with that definition, and,
since the fund here taxed was the amount realized from
the sale of the sfock in 1917, less the capital investment

as determined by the trustee as of March 1, 1913, it is
palpable that it was a "gain or profit" "produced by"
or "derived from" that investment, and that it "proceeded," and was "severed" or rendered severable, from
it, by the sale for cash, and thereby became that "realized
gain" which has been repeatedly declared to be taxable
income within the meaning of the constitutional amendment and the acts of Congress. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers
Co., and Eisner v. Macomber, supra.
It is elaborately argued in this case, in No. 609, Eldorado Coal & Mining Co. v. Mager, post, 522, submitted
with it, and in other cases since argued, that the word
-'income" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment and in
the Income Tax Act we are considering does not include
the gain from capital realized by a single isolated sale of
property but that only the profits realized from sales by
one engaged in buying and selling as a business-a merchant, a real estate agent, or broker--constitute income
which may be taxed.
It is sufficient to say, of this contention, that no such
distinction was recognized in the Civil War Income Tax
Act of 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 478, or in the Act of
1894, c. 349, 28 Stat. 509, 553, declared unconstitutional
on an unrelated ground; that it was not recognized in
determining income under the Excise Tax Act of 1909,
Ls the cases cited, supra, show; that it is not to be found,
in terms, in any of the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917 or 1919; that the
definition of the word "income" as used in the Sixteenth
Amendment, which has been developed by this court,
does- not recognize any such distinction; that in departmental practice, for now seven years, such a rule has not
been applied; 'and -that there is no essential difference in
the nature pf the transaction or in the relation of the
profit to the. capital involved, whether the sale or conversion be a single, isolated transaction or one of many.

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA.

521

Opinion of the Court.

The interesting and ingenious argument, which is earnestly pressed upon us, that this distinction is so fundamental and obvious that it must be assumed to be a part
of the "general understanding" of the meaning of the
word " income" fails to convince us that a construction
should be adopted which would, in a large measure,
defeat the purpose of the Amendment.
The opinions of the courts in dealing with the rights
of life tenants and remaindermen in gains derived from
invested capital, especially in divideuds paid by corporations, are of little value in determining such a question as we have here, influenced as such decisions are
by the terms of the instruments creating the trusts involved and by the various rules adopted in the various
jurisdictions for attaining results thought to be equitable.
Here the trustee, acting within its powers, sold the stock,
as it might have sold a building, and realized a profit of
$700,000, whizh at once became assets in its possession
free for any disposition within the scope of the trust but
for the purposes of taxation to be treated as if the trustee
were the sole owner.
Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, much relied upon in
argument, was sufficiently distinguished irom cases such
as we have here in Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co.,
247 U. S. 189, 191. The differences in the statutes involved render inapplicable the expressions in the opinion in that case (not necessary to the decision of it) as to
distinctions between income and increase of capital.
In Lynch v. Tuiish, 247 U. S. 221, also much relied
upon, it is expressly stated that, "according to the fact
admitted, there was no increase after that date [March
1, 19131 and therefore no increase subject to the law."
For this reason the questions here discussed and decided
were not there presented.
The British income tax decisions are interpretations
of statutes so wholly different in their wording from the

acts of Congress which we are considering that they are
quite without. value in arriving at the construction of
the laws here involved.
Another assessment on a. small gain realized upon a
purchase, made in 1914, of bonds which were duly called
for redemption and paid in 1917, does not present any
questions other than those which We have discussed and
therefore it does not call for separate consideration.
