-GOODRICH v. EDWARDS, UNITED STATES COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE FOR THE
SECOND DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORiNo. 663.

Arguied March 10, 11, 1921.-Decided March 28, 1921.

1. Profit realized upon'the sale of stocks held as an investment is income, and so much of it as accrued after March 1, 1913, is taxable
under the Income Tax Laws of 1916, 1917, and the Sixteenth Amendment. P. 534. Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, ante,
509.,

2. The statute imposes tie income tax on the proceeds of a sale of
personal property to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by the vendor; and ยง 2 (c) is applicable only where a gain over
the original capital investment has been realized after March 1,
1913. P. 535..

Reversed'in part; affirmed in part.
THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Wiliam D. Guthrie, with whom Mr. Langdon P.
Marvin, Mr. Henry M. Ward, Mr. Herbert Pope and Mr.
Rush C. Butler were on the briefs, for plaintiff in error:
The increase in value of property held for investment,
when realized by sale, is not "income" within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. Income here is to be
taken as having the meaning commonly understood and
judicially defined. Einer v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189;
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407.
Prior to the Amendment, income had been judicially
defined by this court in Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63,
by the highest courts of many of the States in the law of
estates and trusts, and by the courts of Great Britain

255 U. S.

and of the British Dominions and Colonies In construing
their income tax laws, as excluding increment of value
realized upon the sale of property held for investment.
To the same effect as Gray v. Darlington, was the opinion
of Mr. Justice Grier in Bennet v. Baker (footnote to 15
Wall. 67), and the judgment of the Circuit Court in
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Page, 1 Biss.
461, 466. This court followed and approved Gray v.
Darlingtonin Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221.

It must reasonably be presumed that Congress, when
it proposed the Sixteenth Amendment, and the state
legislatures, when they ratified it, intended to adopt this
judicial interpretation and definition of the word income.
The conclusion is, therefore, fully warranted that both
those who proposed the Sixteenth Amendment and those
who ratified it understood and appreciated the force and
effect of the decision of this court in Gray v. Darlington,
and acted upon the belief that such a deliberate and authoritative definition of "income " and "capital "-for
purposes of taxation would constitute at once the measure
and the limitation of the extension of the power of Congress "to lay and collect taxes on incomes

.

. with-

out apportionment," so as not to conflict with the constitutional provisions requiring direct taxes on property to
be apportioned.
Particularly must it be apparent that this was the
understanding of the state legislatures, since they knew
that it was universally held to be the law in the United
States that a gain realized by a trustee upon the sale of
a part of the corpus or principal of a trust fund constituted
capital or principal and not income, and belonged to
the remainderman and not to the life tenant, when the
life tenant was, by the express terms of the instrument
creating the trust, entitled to all income arising from the
trust estate.
That this common and familiar distinction did not

GOODRICH v. EDWARDS.
527.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

directly appertain to taxation, is quite immaterial.
Indeed, this court has so held in Towne v. Eisner, 245
U. S. 418, 426.
For many years prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth
Amendment, the British courts had held and have since
continued to hold that capital in any form, whether the
realized increment of value upon the sale of property by
an individual or of capital assets by a corporation, is not
taxable as income under the British income tax laws
which have been in force since 1842. This British authority is peculiarly important in view of the well-known
-fact that American income tax legislation came to us from
England and has always been in large part patterned
after the English enactments (Black, Income Taxes, 4th
ed., ยง 30);,and it should, therefore, reasonably be presumed that both the Sixteenth Amendment and the income tax acts were framed in the light of the British precedents, and "that Congress, in adopting the language
of the English act, had in mind the constructions given
to these words by the English courts, and intended to
incorporate them into the statute." Interstate Commerce
Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 145 U. S. 263,
284. See also Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., 220 U. S. 235,
253-4; McDonald v. Hovey, 110 U. S. 619, 628. The
rule to this effect, thus settled in England and* Scotland, also prevails in the British Colonies and Dominions.
Prior, therefore, to 1909 when the Sixteenth Amendment was proposed and 1913 when it W'as finally adopted,
the word "income " was generally understood and had
been quite generally defined as having a meaning distinct
from, and exclusive of, the increment of value realized
upon the sale of property leld for investment, by an
individual, or the capital assets of a corporation.
If the views expressed by this court subsequent to
1913 be analyzed,, this conclusion is strongly reinforced.

255 U. S.

The so-called "income "which measured the corporation
tax was not and was not intended to be the "income "
signified and intended in and by the Sixteenth Amnend'
ment, and it has been repeatedly recognized by this court
that the senses in which the terms were used are different
in the two cases. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert,
231 U. S. 399, 414, 416, and other cases.
Where, on the other hand, a true income tax-act was
involved and capital profits were realized upon the change
of an investment under circumstances in nowise related
to the carrying on of business, as -in Gray v. Darlington,
15 Wall. 63; or where under a true income tax law capital
profits were realized, not in the course of the business,
but upon the winding-up and termination thereof, which
is after all but another mode or form of changing an investment, as was the case in Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S.
221, the court in each instance declared that the increment remained capital, despite its conversion or transmutation into cash. And this court has recently stated
that "enrichment through increase in value of capital
investment is not income in any proper meaning of the
term." Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 214, 215.
An increase in the value of an investment, not made or
held as a part of any trade or business transaction, is
plainly "a gain accruing to capital " and a "growth or
increment of value in the investment," within the definition of the court in Eisner v. Macomber, supra. In no
proper sense does it proceed from the property, as do
rents, interest, dividends and other familiar forms of
income; and such a gain, when realized, cannot properly
be described as "severed from the capital " for it remains
an integral part of the capital as much as if it had not been
converted.
Before conversion into money, no one would question
that the property was capital, although it then included
the enhancement of value. Bearing in mind that the

GOODRICH v. EDWARDS.
527.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

Sixteenth Amendment is not to be "extended by loose
construction" ' and that it is "essential to distinguish'
. .
between what is and what is not 'income'
according to truth and Substance, without regard to form"
(Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 206), we must find some
distinct benefit to the taxpayer as income directly attributable to the conversion, before it can be declared
that what the taxpayer now has is, not merely his capital,
but income instead. Otherwise, the mere fact of conversion, that is, the form alone, would prevail over the
substance and be made the decisive factor. Yet the
court has declared, although in considering the Act of
1909, that "subsequent change of form by conversion
into money did not change the essence." Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 187.
Mere conversion of capital investments and change
into money cannot, therefore, be determinative, even
though more money is thus actually brought to hand than
was originally put into the investment several years before. Otherwise, Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, was
wrongly decided.
The Income Tax Law of 1916 does not levy a tax upon
the increment in value of capital assets when realized
by sale.
As the sale or conversion of the stock of the Goodrich
Company represented an actual loss, no part of the proceeds was taxable as income of the taxpayer.
The Solicitor General for defendant in error:
Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment,
the word "income," as understood by the legislative,
the executive, and the judicial branches of the Government, included gains or profits derived .from the sale

Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 226; Eisner v. Macomber,
252 U. S. 189, 207.
In the framing of state income tax laws it has been
customary to treat income as including gains derived
from the sale of capital assets.
The cases under the Act of 1913 dealing with the distribution of corporate assets among stockholders are in
no way in conflict with .the Government's contention in
this case. Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339; Eisner v.
Macomber, supra; Lynch v. Turrish, supra; Southern
Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330; Peabody V. Eisner, 247
U. S. 347. These cases establish the proposition that
gains derived from the sale of capital assets constitute
income when received.
Investments are ordinarily made in contemplation
of two kinds of returns,-one current income while the
investment is held, and the other the profit to berealized,
through appreciation in value, upon the final disposition
of the investment.
The debates in Congress, when the Act of 1913 was
under consideration, do not show an understanding that
such gains as are now in question were not understood
to be income.
The tax on gains derived from the sale of property
is not confined to such gains arising from transactions
conducted as a part of one's business or trade.

GOODRICH v. EDWARDS.
527.

Opinion of the Court.

Whether under the decisions of the English courts
gains of this kind are treated as income can have no
determining effect in deciding the question now at issue.
The fact that under the laws of various States gains
derived from the sale of capital assets are, as between a
life tenant and a remainderman, treated as principal and
not as income, affords no reason for saying that such
gains are not income which Congress may tax.
The construction of the Act of 1916, under which the
taxes in this case were collected, does not work any more
hardship or injustice than is inevitable under any general
tax law.
But the statute imposes the tax, upon a sale of property, only where there is a gain over the original investment.
Mr. Hoke Smith and Mr. T. P. Gore, by leave of court,

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The plaintiff in error sued the defendant, a collector
of Internal Revenue, to recover income taxes assessed
in 1920 for the year 1916 and paid under protest to avoid
penalties. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained
and the constitutional validity of a law of the United
States is so involved, that the case is properly here by
writ of error. Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418.
Two transactions are involved.
(1) In 1912 the plaintiff in error purchased 1,000 shares
of the capital stock of a mining company for which he
paid $500. It is averred that the stock was worth $695
on March 1, 1913,- and that it was sold in March, 1916,.
for $13,93l.22. The tax which the plaintiff in error seeks
to recover was assessed on the difference between the

.OCTOBER TERM,. 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

255 U,,V.,

value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and the amount for
which it was sold.
(2) The plaintiff in error being the owner of shares of
the capital stock of another corporation, in 1912 exchanged
them for stock, in a reorganized comp-ny, of the then
value of $291,600. It is averred and admitted that on
March 1, 1913, the value of this stock was $148,635.50,
and that it was sold in 1916 for $269,346.25. Although
it is thus apparent that the stock involved was of less
value on March 1, 1913, than when it was acquired, and
that it was ultimately sold at a loss to the owner, nevertheless the collector assessed the tax on the difference
between the value on March 1, 1913, and the amount
for which it was sold.
The plaintiff in error seeks to recovEr the whole of
these two assessments.
The same contention is made with respect to each of
these payments as was made in No. 608, Merchans'.Loan
& Trust Co. v. Smietanka, this day decided, ante, 509, viz,
that the amounts realized from the sales of the stocks were
in their inherent nature capital as distinguished from
income, being an increment in value of the 3ecurities while
owned and held as an investment and therefore not taxable under the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756) as
amended in 1917 (40 Stat. 300) or under any constitutional law.
With respect to the first payment. It is plain that this
assessment was on the profit accruing after March 1, 19!3,
the effective date of the act, realized to the owner by the
sale after deducting his capital investment. The question
involved is ruled by No. 608, eupra, and the amount was
properly taxed.
As to the Fiecond payment. The Government comesses
error in the judgment with respect to this assessment.
The stock was sold in the year for which the tax was
assessed for $22,253.75 less than its value when it was

GOODRICH v. EDWARDS.
W.

Opinion of the Court.

acquired, but. for $120,710.75 more than uis value on
March 1, 1913, and the tax was assessed on the latter
amount.
The act under which the assessment was made provides
that the net income of a "taxable person shall include
gains, profits, and income derived from

.

. . sales,

or dealings in property, whether real or personal,
or gains or profits and income derived from any source
Whatever." (39 Stat. 757; 40 Stat. 300, 307.)
Section 2 (c) of this same act provides that "for the
purpose of .ascertaining the gain derived from a sale or
other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed,
acquired before March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, the fair market price or value of such property as
of March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, shall be
the basis for determining the amount of such gain
derived."
Axd the definition of "income" approved by this court
is: "'The gain derived from capital, from labor, or from
both combined,' provided it be understood to include
profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets."
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207.
It is thus very plain that the statute imposes the income tax on the proceeds of the sale of personal property
to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by the
vendor, and we therefore agree with the Solicitor General
that since no gain was realized on this investment by the
plaintiff in error no tax should have been assessed against
him.
Section 2 (c), is applicable only where a gain over
the original capital investment has been realized after
March 1, 1913, from a sale or other disposition of
property.
It results that the judgment of the District Court as to
the first assessment, as we have described it, is affirmed,
that as to the second assessment it is reversed, and the case
