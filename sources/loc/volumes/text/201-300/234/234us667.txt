CHAPMAN & DEWEY LUMBER CO. v. ST. FRANCIS
LEVEE DISTRICT.
PETITION FOR REHEARING.
No. 82. Petition for rehearing by defendant in error received and distributed to the Justices on March 6, 1914.-Decided June 22, 1914.
In presenting petitions for rehearing a duty rests upon counsel to deal
with the case as it is disclosed by the record.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Samuel Adams, Mr. H. F. Roleson, Mr. .. C. Hawthorne and Mr. N. F. Lamb for petitioner.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
Leave to file a petition for rehearing is sought in this
case. The petition has been examined, and we find it so
wanting in merit that leave to file it must be denied.
Doubtless, a formal denial would suffice, but we prefer
to notice two statements in the petition.
As our opinion (232 U. S. 186) shows, the controlling
question was, whether a patent issued to the State of
Arkansas in 1858 under the Swamp-land Act embraced
all the lands within the exterior boundaries of a designated

township, or only the lands lying without certain meander
lines shown upon the official plat which, by reference, was
made part of the description in the patent. The plat
showed that large areas in the township, amounting to
8,000 acres or more, were meandered as bodies of water
called "Sunk Lands;" and that the remaining areas were
surveyed into sections and parts of sections, the aggregate
of which, according to an inscription upon the plat, was
14,329.97 acres. Deducting. from the latter 514.30 acres
in fractional section 16, which had passed to the State
under the school-land grant' left 13,815.67 acres, and this
was the acreage given in the patent, from which section 16
was excepted. The mode of claiming lands under the
Swamp-land Act was by presenting selection lists to the
Surveyor General, and, as bearing upon what was intended
to be conveyed by the patent, we stated that the list
in this instance "described the township as containing
14,329.97 acres, the total of the surveyed areas as inscribed
upon the plat," and that this, less the 514.30 acres in fractional section 16, was the area given in the patent.
One of the statements in the petition for rehearing is
that our opinion "proceeds on the hypothesis, unsupported
by the record," that the Governor of Arkansas, in his
request for the patenting of the township in question,
stated its acreage. In assuming that it is our duty to
deal with the case as it is disclosed by the record, counsel are clearly right, A like obligation rests upon counsel.
The record (p. 207) contains a certificate from the General
Land Office, introduced in evidence without objection,
saying: "The original selection list of swamp lands. in
T. 12 N., R. 7 E., [the township in question] gives the
area of the township as 14,329.97 acres,'and that amount
was also given in the approved list. Section 16, which
passed to the State under the school grant, contains 514.30
acres, and as such lands were not granted under the swampland laws, the area of section 16 was deducted from the

total of the township, leaving 13,815.67 acres, which
amount was accounted for in the patent." The certificate
stands uncontradicted in the record and was accepted by
the Supreme Court of the State as determinative of the
facts recited in it (100 Arkansas, 94, 97). Nothing more,
need be said upon this point.
that we ,erred in
Another statement in the petition is,
treating the meandered areas embodying the lands in
controversy as unsurveyed lands. The record (p. 1)
shows that the complaint filed in the court of first instance,
and which counsel seek to maintain, alleged that these
lands " were left unsurveyed by the United States Government." The sunk lands were also described by the representative of the State as "not yet surveyed," when the
State's claims under the Swamp-land grant were being
adjusted and settled in 1895. H. R. Rep. No. 1634, 54th
Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 5 and 32. This will suffice upon this
point.
