EQUITABLE SURETY COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA, TO THE USE OF McMILLAN.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA.
No. 861.

Argued April 15, 1914.-Decided June 8, 1914.

The obligation given by the surety under the District of Columbia
Materialmen's Act of 1899 which is modeled after the General Materialmen's Act of 1894, has a dual aspect, being given not only to
secure the Government the faithful performance of all the obligations
assumed towards it by the contractor, but also to protect third persons from whom the contractor may obtain materials and labor;
these two agreements being as distinct as though contained in separate instruments, the surety cannot claim exemption from liability
to pbrsons supplying materials merely on account of changes made
by the Government and the contractor without its knowledge and
which do not alter the general character of the work. United States v.
National Surety Co., 92 Fed. Rep. 549, approved.
Under the rule of strictissimijuris, the agreement altering the contract
must be participated in by the obligee or creditor as well as the principal in order to discharge the surety; in the case of a bond under the
Materialmen's Acts of 1894 or 1899, there is no single obligee or
creditor to consent thereto and the rule of strictissimijuris does not

Statement of the Case.

apply where the alterations agreed upon do not change the general
nature of the work.
In this case the alterations of the terms of a contract for building a
school house in the District of Columbia altering its location but
without affecting its general character, without the knowledge or
consent of the surety, did not have the effect of releasing the surety
from the obligation of the bond given under the District of Columbia
Materialmen's Act of February 28, 1899.
Quwre, and not involved in this case, what would be the result of a change
not contemplated in the original contract as between the District of
Columbia and so great as to amount to abandonment of the contract?

THE Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia certifies that the record in the above entitled cause, now pending in said court upon appeal from the Supreme Court of
the District of Columbia, discloses the following:
The declaration of the United States to the use of
W. McMillan and Son, filed February 11, 1913, against
the Equitable Surety Co. alleges:
That Allen T. Howison, as principal, and the Equitable
Surety Co., as surety, on July 24, 1911, executed a bond
to the United States in the penal sum of $110,350.00,
conditioned for the faithful performance by Howison of a
certain contract made by him with the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia on that date. A copy of the
bond, made an exhibit, shows that the contract was for
the erection of a school building fronting on Eleventh
Street, N. W., between Harvard and Girard Streets, in
the City of Washington. The conditions of the bond are
that if Howison shall perform to the satisfaction of the
Commissioners the work to be done by him in accordance
with the stipulations of the contract, and shall save harmless and indemnify the District of Columbia from any
and all claims, delays, suits, charges, damages, judgments,
etc., on account of any accidents to persons or property
after the commencement of the work and prior to completion and acceptance, and pay the same; and "will,
promptly make payments to all persons supplying him

with labor and material in the prosecution of the work
provided for in said contract," etc., the obligation shall be
void; otherwise to remain in force.
That thereafter W. McMillan & Son, at the request of
the Butt-Chapple Stone Co., agreed to furnish to said
contractor certain stone materials to be used in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract by the contractor, and did furnish to said contractor materials of the
kind and quality specified in his contract to the value of
$4,452.84, of which material the contractor used in the
building a quantity of the value of $3,952.84 for which
he has failed to make payment. And that defendant,
though requested so to do, has refused to pay the same.
The affidavit of the plaintiff in support of the declaration
follows the requirements of Rule 73.
After the general issue, defendant filed a special plea
denying liability on said bond because after the execution
and delivery of the same, and without the knowledge or
consent of defendant, the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia and the said Howison, its principal, altkred
the contract the performance of which was guaranteed by
said bond. That said alteration consisted in the entire
changing of the building from one fronting on Eleventh
Street to one fronting on Harvard Street, which alteration
involved the contractor in considerable expense not contemplated in the original contract, and prejudicial to defendant. That said relocation of the building necessitated
a material change in grading the ground. That prior to
the change of location the contractor had graded the
ground as required in the contract and expended therein
the sum of $2,393.90. And that by reason of the change
said sum was a total loss to the contractor, and the further
excavation made necessary by the change of location was
done at a cost of $1,300.90.
The affidavit of defense alleged the said change in the
contract Without its knowledge or consent; and that the

Statement of the Case.

same necessitated a material change in the grading of the
land which had been previously performed by the contractor, at a considerable expenditure not contemplated
in the original contract, and prejudicial to the defendant.
On motion under the 73rd Rule of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia the court entered judgment
for the plaintiff for the amount of the demand; and defendant has appealed therefrom.
By stipulation two other cases involving the same question here presented are to abide the result of this case.,
The act of Congress, in compliance with the requirements of which the aforesaid bond was executed, (c. 218,
30 Stat. 906), reads as follows:
"An Act Relative to the payment of claims for material
and labor furnished for District of Columbia Buildings.
"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter any person or persons entering into a
formal contract with the District of Columbia for the
construction of any public building, or the prosecution
and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any
public building Lor public work, shall be required, before
commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond,
with good and sufficient sureties, with the additional obligations that such contractor or contractors shall promptly
make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor
and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in
such contract; and any person or persons making application therefor and furnishing affidavit to the department
under the direction of which said work is being or has been
prosecuted that labor or materials for the prosecution of
such work has been supplied by him or them, and payment for which has not been made, shall be furnished with
a certified copy of said contract and- bond, upon which
said person or persons supplying such labor and materials
shall have a right of action, and shall be authorized to

bring suit in the name of the District of Columbia or the
United States for his or their use and benefit against said
contractor 'and sureties and to prosecute the same to final
judgment and execution: Provided, That such action and
its prosecution shall not involve the District of Columbia
or the United States in any expense: Provided, That in
such case the court in which such action is brought is
authorized to require proper security for costs in case
judgment is for the defendant.
"Approved, February 28, 1899."
The Court of Appeals further certifies that the following
question of law arises upon the record; that its decision is
necessary to the proper disposition of the cause; and to
the end that a correct result may be reached desires the
instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States
upon that question, to wit:
Did the alteration of the terms of the contract by the
District of Columbia and the contractor, without the
knowledge or consent of the surety, have the effect to
release the surety from the obligation of the bond?
Mr. J. J. Darlington,with whom Mr. Joseph A. Burkart
and. Mr. William E. Ambrose were on the brief, for the
Equitable. Surety Company:
The surety obligation is not to be extended because
the surety is a corporation, or because a premium Was
paid.
The change of site created a new contract, not binding
on the surety, either as to owner or sub-contractors.
The bond was security for labor and materials for work
provided for in the contract guaranteed by the surety.
The argument ab inconvenienti will not apply.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

The agency of the District of Columbia ends with obtaining the bond.
The materials were furnished under contract for which
bond was given.
In support of these contentions, see Mining Co. v.
Cullins, 104 -U. S. 176; United States &c. v. American
Surety Co., 200 U. S. 199; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Smoot,

559; United States v. Lynch, 192 Fed. Rep. 364; United
States v. Freel, 186 t. S. 309.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The act of February 28, 1899 (c. 218, 30 Stat. 906), under
which the bond in question was given, was modeled after
an act of August 13, 1894, entitled, "An Act for the protection of persons furnishing material and labor for the
construction of public works," (c. 280, 28 Stat. 278).'
In an action founded upon a bond given under the latter
act, it was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit, in United States v. National Surety Co.,
92 Fed. Rep. 549, 551, that the obligation has a dual aspect, it being given, in the first place, to secure to the
Government the faithful performance of all obligations
which a contractor may assume towards it; and, in the
second place, to protect third persons from whom the
contractor may obtain materials or labor; and that these
two agreements are as distinct as if contained in separate
instruments. It was consequently held that the sureties
in such a bond could not claim exemption from liability
to persons who had supplied labor or materials to their
principal, to enable him to execute his contract with the
United States, simply because the Government and the

contractor, without the surety's knowledge, had made
changes in the contract subsequent to the execution of
the bond, the changes being such as did not alter the general character of the work contemplated by the contract
or the general character of the materials necessary for
its execution.
In support of this decision several cases from the state
courts were cited, among them Dewey v. State, 91 -Inaiana; 173, 185; Conn v. State; 125 Indiana, 514, 518;
Steffes v. Lemke, 40 Minnesota, 27, 29; and Doll v. Crume,
41 Nebraska, 655, 660. They fairly sustain the conclusion
.reached. The cases cited from the Indiana and Minnesota
reports antedated the passage of the act of 1894, and may
have furnished the suggestion for that enactment.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in United
States v. National Surety Co., supra, although never until
now brought under the review of this court, has been many
times cited and followed in the other Federal courts.

In Guaranty Co. v. PressedBrick Co., 191 U. S. 416, and
Hill v. American Surety Co., 200 U. S. 197, 203, this court
adopted a reasonably liberal construction of the act of
1894, in view of the fact that it was evidently designed to
furnish the obligation of a bond as a substitute for the
security which might otherwise be obtained by attaching
a lien to the property; such lien not being permissible in
the case of a Goverinment work.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

It seems to us that the construction given to that act
in the case in 92 Fed. Rep. is correct, and that it applies
equally to the Act of 1899, now under consideration; and
that this act, like the other, should receive a reasonably
liberal interpretation in aid of the public object whose
accomplishment is so evidently intended. Its title is, "An
Act relative to the payment of claims for material and
labor furnished for District of Columbia buildings."
The enacting clause, as well as the title, shows that Congress recognized that no legislation was necessary in order
to enable the Commissioners of the District to require
"the usual penal bond with good and sufficient sureties"
from a contractor engaged for the construction of a public
building. The object of the legislation was to give legal
sanction to the "additional obligation that such contractor
or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the
prosecution of the work provided for in such contract,"
and to give to such a laborer or materialman the right to
bring an action if necessary upon the bond, either in the
name of the District of Columbia or of the United States,
for his own benefit, against the contractor and sureties.
The nominal obligee is, with respect to these third parties,
a mere trustee, and the obligors, including the surety as
well as the principal contractor, enter into the obligation
in full view of this. The public is concerned not merely
because laborers and materialmen (being without the
benefit of a mechanic's lien in the case. of public buildings)
would otherwise be subject to great losses at the hands of
insolvent or dishonest contractors, but also because the
security afforded by the bond has a substantial tendency
to lower the prices at which labor and material will be
furnished, because of the assurance that the claims will
be paid.
Stress is placed by counsel for the Surety Company upon
the fact that the building was materially altered, and in a

EQUITABLE SURETY CO. v. McMILLAN.

Opinion of the Court.

manner that involved the contractor in considerable expense not contemplated in the original contract. If these
alterations were made pursuant to a stipulation for that
purpose contained in the contract, they were binding
upon the surety, unless they were so extensive and material as to amount to a departure from the original contract
rather than a permissible modification of its details.
United States v. Freel, 92 Fed. Rep. 299; 99 Fed. Rep.
237; 186 U. S. 309.

So far as the certificate shows, however, the contract
here in question contained no clause permitting changes.
In such case it is beside the question to inquire whether
the changes were important, or, indeed, whether they
prejudiced or benefited the contractor. The rule that
obtains in ordinary cases is that any change in the contract made between the principals without the consent of
the surety discharges the obligation of the latter, even
though the change be beneficial to the principal obligor.
But it lies at the foundation of this rule of strictissimi
juris that the agreement altering the undertaking of the
principal must be participated in by the obligee or creditor, in order that it may 'have the effect of discharging
the surety. This is expressed or implied in all the cases.
Miller v. Stewart, 9 Wheat. 680, 703, 708, 709; Sprigg v.
Bank of Mount Pleasant, 14 Pet. 201, 208; Magee v. Manhattan Life Ins. Co., 92 U. S.93, 98; Union Mutual Life
Ins. Co. v. Hanford, 143 U. S. 187, 191; PrairieState Bank
v. United States, 164 U. S.227, 233; United States v. Freel,
186 U. S.309, 310, 317.

In the case of a bond given under a statute such as the
act of February 28, 1899, there is no single obligee or
creditor. The surety is charged with notice that he is
entering into what is in. a very proper sense a public
obligation, and one that will be relied upon by persons
who can in no manner control the conduct of the nominal
obligee, and with respect to whom the latter is a mere

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

trustee, and therefore incapable, upon general principles
of equity, of bartering away, for its own benefit or convenience, the rights of the beneficiaries. In the light of
the statute, the surety becomes bound for the performance
of the work by the principal in accordance with the stipulations of the contract, and for the prompt payment of
the sums due to all persons supplying labor and material
in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.
What would be the result of a change not contemplated
in the original contract, as betwcen the District of Columbia, consenting to the change, and the Surety Company,
not consenting thereto, is a question not now before us,
and respecting which we express no opinion. But with
respect to obligations incurred by the contractor to
laborers and materialmen, at least so far as their labor and
materials are supplied in accordance with the original
contract, it is obvious, we think, that a construction which
would discharge the surety because of any change to
which the laborers and materialmen were not parties
would'defeat the principal object that Congress had in
view in enacting the statute. If the change were so great
as to amount to an abandonment of the contract and the
substitution of a substantially different one, so that persons supplying labor and materials would necessarily be'
charged with notice of such abandonment, a different
question would be presented. But, in the case of such a
change as was here made-a mere change of position and
location of the building, without affecting its general
character; involving changes in grading, but having nothing to do with the furnishing of the materials upon which
the action is based-it seems to us that the responsibility
of the surety to the materialman remains unaffected.
The question certified will be answered.in the negative.
