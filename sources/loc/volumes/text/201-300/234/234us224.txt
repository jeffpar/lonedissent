KEOKEE CONSOLIDATED COKE COMPANY v.
TAYLOR.
SAME v. KELLY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE.
OF VIRGINIA.
Nos. 372, 373.

Submitted May 7, 1914.-Decided June 8, 1914.

This court does not go behind the construction given to a state statute
by the state courts.
A state statute aimed at an evil and hitting it presumably where
experience shows it to be most felt is not unconstitutional under the
equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment because
.there might be other instances to which it might be equally well
applied.
It is for the legislature to determine to what classes a police statute
shall apply; and unless there is a clear case of discrimination the
courts will not interfere.
Section 3 of Chapter 391, Virginia Laws of 1888, reenacting the act of
1887 aimed at the evil of payment of labor in orders redeemable only
at the employers' shops and forbidding certain classes of employers
of labor to issue any order for payment thereto unless purporting

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

to be redeemable for its face value in lawful money of the United
States, is not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the
law because it does not apply to other classes of employers who also
own shops and pay with orders redeemable in merchandise.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of a
statute of Virginia providing for method of payment of
employ6s of certain industries, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. J. F. Bullitt and Mr. R. T. Irvine for plaintiff in
error:
The Virginia act is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, nor is it a
valid exercise of police power.
The act is not constitutional; it does not embrace all
of a class.
The act is class legislation even though it should be held
to be a police regulation.
If an act is repugnant to the Constitution, it is not
saved by the police power doctrine. The usual statement
of the doctrine is too broad.
The burden is on plaintiffs to show that the act is
within the police power.
The act would injure rather than benefit employ~s as
well as employers.
In support of these contentions, see Virginia Code

Opinion of the Court.

9 Michigan, 285, 307. Dayton Coal & Iron Co. v. Barton,
183 U. S. 13, distinguished.
Mr. J. C. Noel and Mr. C. T. Duncan for defendants in
error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
These are actions of assumpsit brought by the defendants in error upon orders signed by employds of the plaintiff in error and addressed to it, directing it to pay to
bearer 'in merchandise only from your store,' to the value
specified. These orders were upon scrip issued by the
plaintiff in error as an advance of monthly wages in payment for labor performed, and the only controversy between the parties arises from the refusal of the plaintiff
in error to pay the indicated amounts in money. The
facts were agreed, the Circuit Court gave judgment for the
plaintiff and a writ of error was refused by the Supreme
Court of Appeals. The ground of the judgment was an act
of February 13, 1888, c. 118, amending and reenacting an
act of 1887, c. 391, ยง 3, forbidding any person, firm, or
corporation, engaged in mining coal or ore, or manufacturing iron or steel or any other kind of manufacturing to
issue for the payment of labor any order unless the same
purported to be redeemable for its face value in lawful
money of the United States. The plaintiff in error saved
its rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and when the
Court of Appeals refused to hear the cases brought them
here. The writ of error was allowed on September 25,
1912. Norfolk & Suburban Turnpike Co. v. Virginia, 225
U. S. 264, 269.
Of course we do not go behind the construction given
to the state law by the state courts. The objections that
are urged here are that the statute interferes with freedom
of contract, and, more especially, that it is class legislation

of a kind supposed to be inconsistent with the Fourteenth
Amendment; a West Virginia decision upon a similar
statute being cited to that effect. State v. Goodwill, 33
W. Va. 179. The former of these objections, however, is
disposed of by knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison,183 U. S. 13,
and Dayton Coal & Iron Co. v. Barton, 183 U. S. 23.
It is more pressed that the act discriminates unconstitutionally against certain classes. But while there are
differences of opinion as to, the degree and kind of discrimination permitted by the Fourteenth Amendment, it is
established by repeated decisions that a statute aimed at
what is deemed an evil, and hitting it presumably where
experience shows it to be most felt, is not to be upset by
thinking. up and enumerating 6ther instances to which
it might have been applied equally well, so far as the court
can see. That is for the legislature to judge unless the
case is very clear. Lindsloy v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.,
220 U. S. 61, 81. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota,
226 U. S. 157, 160. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S.
138, 144. The suggestion that others besides mining and
manufacturing companies may keep shops and pay their
workmen with orders on themselves for merchandise is
not enough to overthrow a. law that must be presumed to
be deemed by the legislature coextensive with the practical need.
Judgments affirmed.
