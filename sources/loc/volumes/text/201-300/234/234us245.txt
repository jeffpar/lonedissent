UNITED STATES v. NICHOLS-CHISHOLM LUMBER COMPANY.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 873, 874, 875.

Argued April 7, 1914.-Decided June 8, 1914.

The natural and usual signification of plain terms is to be adopted as
the legislative meaning in the absence of clear showing that something else was meant.
The rule that words in treaties with, and statutes affecting, Indians,
must be interpreted as the Indians understood them is not applicable where the statute is not, in the nature of a contract and does
not require the consent of the Indians to make it effectual.
The after facts have but little weight in determining the meaning of
legislation and cannot overcome the meaning of plain words used
in a statute; nor can the courts be influenced in administering a law
by the fact that its true interpretation may result in harsh consequences.
The responsibility for the justice and wisdom of legislation rests with
Congress and it is the province of the courts to enforce, not to make,
the laws.
The policy of the Government in enacting legislation is often an uncertain thing as to which opinions may vary and it affords an unstable ground of statutory construction.
Congress has on several occasions put full blood Indians in one class
and all others in another class.
If a given construction was intended by Congress, which it would have
been easy to have expressed in apt terms, other terms actually used
will not be given a forced interpretation to reach that result.
While the early administration of a statute showing the departmental

construction thereof does not have the same weight which a long observed departmental construction has, it is entitled to consideration
as showing the construction placed upon the statute by competent
men charged with its enforcement.
Courts may not supply words in a statute which Congress has omitted;
nor can such course be induced'by any consideration of public policy
or the desire to promote justice in dealing with dependent people.
The Clapp Amendments of June 21, 1906, 34 Stat. 325, 353, and
March 1, 1907, Id. 1015,. 1034, removing restrictions imposed by the
act of 'February 8, 1887, upon alienation of Chippewa allotments
as to mixed bloods apply to mixed bloods of all degrees and not only
to those of half or more than half white blood. Such was'not the
congressional intent as expressed in the statute and this court cannot interpret the statute except according to the import of its plain
terms.

suits were brought by the United States in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the District of
Minnesota against the appellees to set aside certain conveyances under and through which the appellees claimed
title to lands, particularly described, in the White Earth
Indian Reservation in Minnesota. The decree of the District Court (which had succeeded the Circuit Court) in the
first two cases in favor of the Government was reversed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
while the decree dismissing the bill in the last case was
affirmed (208 Fed. Rep. 988).
By the treaty of March 19, 1867, 16 Stat. 719, creating
the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Chippewas of
the Mississippi ceded all their land in Minnesota, except
certain described tracts, to the United States and the
Government set apart the White Earth Reservation for
their use, and provision was made for the certification to
each Indian of not to exceed 160 acres of the land of such
reservation in lots of forty acres each, upon the cultivation
of ten acres, provided, that the land should be exempt
from taxation and sale for debt and should not.be alienated

except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior
and then only to a Chippewa Indian. The act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, provided for the allotment of land in the Indian reservations in severalty to the
Indians and tlhat (ยง 5) upon the approval of the allotments
patents should issue therefor in the name of the allottees,
which should be of the legal effect and declare that the
United States held the land for twenty-five years, in trust
for the sole use and benefit ,of the Indian to whom the
allotment was made, or, in case of his death, of his heirs,
according to the laws of the State or Territory where the
land was located, and that at the expiration of that time
the United States would convey the same to the Indian or
his heirs in fee, discharged of the trust and free of all charge
or incumbrance whatsoever, provided that the President
of the United States might in his discretion extend the
period, and provided that any conveyance or contract
touching the lands before the expiration of the trust period
should be null and void. The Nelson Act of January 14,
1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642, provided for the relinquishment
to the United States of that part of the reservation remaining after the allotment, subject to the act of February 8,
1887, supra, in severalty, to the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota, the act to become operative only upon the assent
of a certain number of Indians being obtained. By the
act of February 28, 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794, the allotments were limited to eighty acres to each Indian, but by
the Steenerson Act-of April 28, 1904, c. 1786, 33 Stat. 539,
the maximum allotments of the White Earth Reservation
were made 160 acres. The acts of June 21, 1906, c. 3504,
34 Stat. 325, 353, and March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat.
1015, 1034, in what is known as the Clapp Amendment,
removed the restrictions upon alienation as respects mixed
blood Indians, but left the matter, so far as full bloods were
concerned, to the Secretary of the Interior.
The Government relied, in the first case, upon its title

to a certain parcel of land as a part of the public domain
set apart as the White Earth Reservation, and the fact
that, although under the various acts of Congress above
mentioned authority was given to segregate certain parcels
of land from others in the reservation and to allot them to
members of the Band, and O-bah-baum, an Indian woman
of that tribe, had been given a trust patent, as provided
for by the act of February 8, 1887, supra, and had given
a mortgage to the defendant in that case upon such land,
she had no right or authority so to do. It prayed that the
mortgage be annulled, as being a cloud upon the Government's title.
The allegations of the complaints in the second and
third cases are the same, except that the allottee in the
former is named Bay-bah-mah-ge-wabe and in the latter
Equay-zaince, and in both cases that there are outstanding
warranty deeds and mortgages, that there were intermediate parties not made parties of record, and that an
accounting was asked for timber already cut and an injunction from cutting standing timber.
The defendant iri the first case, besides denying that
the reservation was a part of the public domain and alleging that the property was that of the Indians and that
after selection the allottee acquired a fee simple title, notwithstanding the acts of Congress, particularly set up the
fact that O-bah-baum is a mixed blood Chippewa Indian,
and one of the class referred to in the Clapp Amendment,
and therefore emancipated from the pretended supervision
of the Government and able to transfer her property as a
citizen of the United States. The defendant also alleged
that under the facts, the Indians having made affidavit
that they were mixed bloods and the good faith of the
defendant, the Government should be required to place
the defendant in statu quo before the relief asked could
be granted. The Lumber Company, defendant in the
second case, and the defendants in the third case, filed

Statement of the Case.

answers of similar purport, with the additional averment
that under the facts stated the matter relating to the timber was immaterial, but if the court found against defendant's title they would account for the timber cut by
them.
By stipulation or introduction in evidence the following
facts were made to appear:
. The three Indians here involved are adult Chippewa
Indians, residing upon the White Earth Reservation.
O-bah-baum has some white blood, derived from a remote
ancestor, but not to exceed one-thirty-second; Bay-bahmah-ge-wabe has one-sixteenth of white blood, and Equay-.
zaince has one-eighth of white blood.
A question having arisen with reference to the construction of the term "mixed blood" as used in the treaty of
September 30, 1854 (10 Stat. 1109), between the United
States and the Chippewa Indians of Lake Superior and
the Mississippi, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in a
letter to the Indian Agent at Detroit, Michigan, said that
"the term 'mixed-bloods' has been construed to mean all
who are identified as having a mixture of Indian and white
blood. The particular proportion of each blood is, therefore, immaterial, where the provision is so broad as that
stated in the treaty."
The Indian Agent at the White Earth Reservation after
the passage of the Clapp Amendment came to Washington
to consult the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and was
referred by him to the Land Division, and, after discussing
the situation with a man. represented to be in charge of
such matters, it was agreed that the act did not require a
showing of any definite quantum of foreign blood to constitute a mixed blood, and to his knowledge this was the
construction generally adopted by those who dealt with
the Indians on the White Earth Reservation. The Chief
of the Land Division at the time of the passage of the
Clapp Amendment testified that to his knowledge no ques-

tion was raised as to the quantum of foreign blood. In 9.
communication dated October 6, 1910, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs the Special Assistant to the Attorney General and the Special Indian Agent at Detroit,
Minnesota, expressed the belief that the attorneys for the
Government were going to contend that the term mixed
blood should be interpreted to embrace only those of half
or less of Indian blood, and cited a certain act of the
United States (of February 6, 1909, c. 80, 35 Stat. 600)
in which the term Indian was defined to include the
aboriginal races inhabiting Alaska when annexed to the
United States and their descendants of the whole or half
blood, which act concerned the sale of liquor or firearms
to an Indian or half breed. They also cited certain treaties
with the Chippewas wherein it was shown that half breeds
are persons of less than half blood and not regarded as
Indians or members of the Chippewa nation: Article 3 of
the treaty of July 29, 1837, 7 Stat. 536; article 4 of the
treaty of October 4, 1842, 7 Stat. 591; article 4 of the treaty
of August 2, 1847, 9 Stat. 904; article 6 of the treaty of
February 22, 1855, 10 Stat. 1165; and article 4 of the treaty
of March 19, 1867, 16 Stat. 719, from which it was summarized that in these treaties persons classed as half
breeds or mixed bloods or less than half blood were not
recognized by the Government or the Chippewas as Indians entitled to the rights and privileges of Chippewa
Indians unless by special provisions of treaties, as theretofore shown. The Second Assistant Commissioner in his
reply of November 19, 1910, stated that the Office was
inclined to give the expressions "full bloods" and "mixed
bloods" their ordinary meaning which would be more
reasonable than to hold that the term full bloods included
those of admitted pure blood and others above the half
blood. It was also said in his letter, however, that a conference would be had with the Department of Justice, and
further advice given. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs

said that he had never given an official construction to the
term mixed blood.
It was stipulated that in administering the Bureau of
Indian Affairs under the Clapp Amendment and especially
in issuing patents thereunder, the Department had not
required any statement as to the quantum of foreign blood,
but had issued patents upon the showing that the applicant
was a mixed blood. Several instances were shown by the
records of allotments having been made to allottees on the
White Earth Reservation having but one-sixteenth or onethirty-second of Indian blood, while other instances were
shown where allotment had been denied because applicant
was of "doubtful blood."
A white man who had resided for d long time among the
Chippewa Indians stated that in the early period the terms
mixed blood and half breed were synonymous, applying
to one of mixed white and Indian blood, irrespective of
the percentage, and that later the term mixed blood was
more commonly used, while the term half breed was applied to one having nearly equal parts of white and Indian
blood. The general impression of business men in and
about the White Earth Reservation was that any Indian
who had white blood in his veins was a mixed blood.
Several very elderly Indians testified, however, that the
Indians regarded the term mixed blood as applying to
those having practically half white and half Indian blood.
The District Court, after stating that the question
was one of first impression, said that Congress intended
competency to be the test and came to the conclusion
that an Indian having an admixture of one-eighth white
blood might. come within the term, but that beyond that
the white blood would not affect the capacity of the Indian
to manage his own affairs, and therefore. dismissed the
bill in the third case and entered a decree in favor of the
complainants in the other two cases. The Circuit Court
of Appeals reached the .conclusion that every Chippewa

Indian having an identifiable mixture of other than Indian
blood, however small, is a mixed blood Indian and all
others are full blood Indians within the meaning of theClapp Amendment, and accordingly reversed the decree
of the District Court in the first two cases and affirmed
the decree in the third case.
The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. C. C. Daniels
and Mr. W. A. Norton, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for the United States:
The history of the legislation involved shows the disastrous effects resulting from its improper application.
The term "mixed blood" is to be applied only to those
Indians who possess a quantum of white blood amounting
to one-half or more.
The act should be so construed as to subserve the welldefined and well-established policy of Congress. Holy
Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U. S. 457; Durousseav. United States, 6 Cranch, 307; Lionberger v. Rouse,
9 Wall. 468, 475; United Slates v. Freeman, 3 How. 556;
United States v. Lacher, 134 U. S. 624.
It has been the settled policy of Congress in dealing
with the Indians to make competency alone the test for
removing these restrictions. Smith v. Stevens, 10 Wall.
321, 326.
Congress having declared in plain and unmistakable
language that lands allotted to these Indians would be
held in trust for them for a period of twenty-five years,
and the assent of the Indians to a cession of their reservation having been given in reliance upon that promise,
no subsequent act of Congress should be construed to
revoke this promise unless couched in language so plain
and certain as to leave room for no other interpretation.

ing a classification based on blood to include in the competent class all who have more than one-half white blood
and in the incompetent class all who have more than onehalf Indian blood. Holy Trinity Church v. United States,
143 U. S. 457.
The act is to be interpreted according to the understanding of its terms among the Indians themselves.
Indian treaties and statutes modifying treaty rights
will be construed as they are understood by the Indians
and not necessarily in accordance with the technical terms
employed by white men in framing them. Jones v.
Meehan, 175 U. S. 1; Starr v. Long Jim, 227 U. S. 613.
Provision for mixed bloods was made in treaties with
the Chippewas by their request, and the identification
of such mixed bloods was left to them.
That the Indians understood the words "mixed blood"
in the sense for which the Government contends is clearly
shown by uncontradicted testimony.
The meaning for which the Government contends is
not foreclosed either by departmental construction or
judicial decisions.

Mr. Ransom J. Powell, with whom Mr. George T. Simpson and-Mr. Ernest C. Carman were on the brief, for appellees:
The Clapp act was obviously designed to create an arbitrary classification.
The language is clear and explicit, and the term "mixed
blood" had acquired a definite and well-understood
meaning.

The interpretation of the term "mixed blood" necessitates the interpretation of the, term "full blood." Congress made two classes, not three.

meaning of the terms used. United States v. Fisher,2 Cr.

MR. JUSTICE DAY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

Before the transfers here complained of and while the
lands were held in trust, subject to. the provisions of the
act of February 8, 1887, supra, the Clapp Amendment
was passed, having the purpose of removing the restrictions upon alienation in certain cases. This act provides,
(34 Stat., p. 1034):
"That all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation for allotments within, the White Earth Reservation
in the State of Minnesota, heretofore [amended March 1,
1907, the word 'heretofore' being substituted for the word
'now'] or hereafter held by adult mixed-blood Indians,
are hereby removed, and the trust deeds heretofore or
hereafter executed by the Department for such allotments
are hereby declared to pass the title in fee simple, or such
mixed bloods upon application shall be entitled to receive
a patent in fee simple for such allotments; and as to full
bloods, said restrictions shall be removed when the Secretary of the Interior is satisfied that said adult full-blood
Indians are competent to handle their own affairs, and in
such case the Secretary of the Interior shall issue to such

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

It is at once apparent from reading this act that it deals
with two classes, adult mixed blood Indians, concerning
whom all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance or taxation
are removed, and full blood Indians, whose right to be
free from restrictions shall rest with the Secretary of the
Interior, who may remove the same upon being satisfied
that such full blood Indians are competent to handle
their own affairs.
This case turns upon the construction of the words
"mixed blood Indians." It is the contention of the Government that mixed blood means those of half white or
more than half white blood, while the appellees insist,
and this was the view adopted by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the term mixed blood includes all who have an
identifiable mixture of white blood. If the Government's
contention be correct, it follows that for the purposes of
this suit all of less than half white blood must be regarded
as full blood Indians, all others as mixed bloods. Upon
the appellees' contention the line is drawn between full
bloods as one class and all having an identifiable admixture
of white blood as the other.
If we apply the general rule of statutory construction
that words are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning, it would seem clear that the appellees' construction
is right, for a full blood is obviously one of pure blood,
thoroughbred, having no admixture of foreign blood.
That this natural and usual signification of plain terms
is to be adopted as the legislative meaning in the absence
of clear showing that something else was meant, is an
elementary rule of construction frequently recognized and
followed in this court. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch,
358, 399; Lake County v. Rollins, 130 U. S. 662, 670; Dewey
v. United States, 178 U. S: 510, 521. Interpreted according
to the plain import of the words the persons intended
to be reached by the clause are divided into two and only
two well-defined classes, full blood Indians and mixed

Opinion of the Court.

bloods. There is no suggestion of a third class, having
more than half of white blood or any other proportion
than is indicated in the term mixed blood, as contrasted
with full blood. If the Government's contention is correct,
the Indians of full blood must necessarily include half
bloods, and mixed bloods must mean all having less than
half white blood and none others. Such construction is
an obvious wresting 'of terms -of plain import from their
usual and well-understood signification.
But the Government insists that to effect the legislative
purpose the words must be interpreted as the Indians
understood them, and cases from this court (Jones v.
Meehan, 175 U. S. 1; Starr v. Long Jim, 227 U. S. 613)
are cited to the effect that Indian treaties and acts to which
the Indians must give conisent before they become operative must be interpreted so as -to conform to the understanding of the Indians as to the meaning of the terms
used. The justice and propriety of this method of interpretation is obvious and essential to the. protection of
an unlettered race, dealing with those of better education
and skill, themselves framing contracts which the Indians
are induced to sign. But the legislation here in question
is not in the nature of contract and contains no provision
that makes it effectual only upon consent of the Indians
whose rights and privileges are to be affected. Evidently
this legislation contemplated in some measure the rights
of others who might deal with the Indians, and obviously
was intended to enlarge the right to acquire as well as to
part with lands held in trust for the Indians.
The Government refers, in support of its contention, to
reports of Congressional committees, showing after effects
of this legislation, which was followed, as the reports
tend to show, by improvident sales and incumbrances
of Indian lands and wasteful extravagance in the disposition of the proceeds of sales, resulting in suffering to the
former proprietors.of the lands sold and mortgaged. But

these after facts can have little weight in determining
the meaning of the legislation and certainly cannot overcome the meaning of plain words used in legislative enactments. If the effect of the legislation has been disastrous
to the Indians, that fact will not justify the courts in departing from the terms of the act as written. If the true
construction has been followed with harsh consequences,
it cannot influence the courts in administering the law.
The responsibility for the justice or wisdom of legislation
rests with the Congress, and it is the province of the courts
to enforce, not to make, the laws. St. Louis, Iron Mt.
& S. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, 210 U. S. 281, 294; Texas Cement
Co. v. McCord, 233 U. S. 157, 163.
The Government further insists that its interpretation
of the act is consistent with its policy to make competency
the test of the right to alienate, and that the legislation in
question proceeds upon the theory that those of half or
more white blood are more likely to be able to take care
of themselves in making contracts and disposing of their
lands than those of lesser admixture of such blood. But
the policy of the Government in passing legislation is
often an uncertain thing, as to which varying opinions
may be formed, and may, as is the fact in this case, afford
an unstable ground of statutory interpretation. Hadden
v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 107, 111. And again Congress
has in other legislation not hesitated to place full blood
Indians in one class and all others in another. Tiger v.
Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286. In that case this
court had occasion to deal with certain sections of the act
of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, providing that no
full blood Indian of certain' tribes should have power to
alienate or incumber allotted lands for a period of twentyfive years, unless restrictions were removed by act of
Congress. By section 22 of the act all adult heirs of deceased Indians were given the right to convey their lands,
but for the last sentence of the section which kept full

Opinion of the Court.

blood Indians to their right to convey under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. Therefore all adult
heirs of any deceased Indian other than a full blood might
convey, but the full blood only with the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior. In this important provisioi the
restrictions were removed as to all classes of Indians other'
than full bloods. In other words, there as here, the Indians
were divided into two classes, full bloods in one class and
all others in the second class.
Furthermore, the appellees' construction accords with
the departmental construction, as shown by the facts
stipulated. Such was the construction given by the Indian Commissioner to the treaty of September 30, 1854,
supra, wherein provision was made for mixed blood Indians among the Chippewas, and the Indian agent at
Detroit, Michigan, was instructed by the Indian Commissioner that the term mixed blood had been construed
to mean all who are identified as having a mixture of
Indian and white blood. Such was the interpretation
of the Department of Interior, in the first place at least,
in administering the matter under the Clapp Amendment.
It is true that the Government representatives at Detroit,
Minnesota, were of the opposite opinion, for the reasons
we have stated above, and that the Second Assistant
Commissioner in his reply, while reaching the conclusion
we have, stated that he would confer with the Department
of Justice.
While departmental construction of the Clapp Amendment does not have the weight which such constructions
sometimes have in'long continued observance, nevertheless it is entitled to consideration,-the early administration of that amendment showing the interpretation placed
upon it by competent men having to do with its enforcement. The conviction is very strong that if Congres intended to remove restrictions only from those who had
half white blood or more, it would have inserted in the

act the words necessary to make that intention clear, that
is, we deem this a case for the application of the often expressed consideration, aiding interpretation, that if a
given construction was intended it would have been easy
for the legislative body to have expressed it in apt terms.

R. Co., 125 U. S. 109, 127; United States v. Lexington
Mill Co., 232 U. S. 399, 410.
Congress was very familiar with the situation, the subject having been before it in many debates and discussions

concerning, Indian affairs. This was a reservation inhabited by Indians of full blood and others of all degrees
of mixed blood, some with a preponderance of white blood,
others with less and many with very little. If Congress,
having competency in mind and that alone, had intended
to emancipate from the prevailing restriction on alienation
only those who were half white or more, by a few simple
words it could have effected that purpose. We cannot believe that such was the congressional intent, and we are
clearly of opinion that the courts may not supply the words

which Congress omitted. Nor can such course be induced
by any consideration of public policy or the desire to promote justice, if such would be its effect, in dealing with
dependent people.
We reach the conclusion that theCircuit Court of Appeals rightly construed this statute, and its decrees are
Affirmed.
