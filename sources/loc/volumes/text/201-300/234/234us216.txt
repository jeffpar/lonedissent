INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COMPANY OF
AMERICA v. COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.

Nos. 276, 291, 292.

Argued April 23, 24, 1914.-Decided June 8,
1914.

An anti-trust criminal law may not necessarily be unconstitutional
merely because it throws upon men the risk of rightly estimating
what is an undue restraint of trade, but to compel a man to guess
what the fair market value of commodities manufactured or sold by
him would be under other than existing conditions is beyond constitutional limits.
The anti-trust provision of the constitution of 1891 and of the acts of
1900 and -1906 of Kentucky, as construed by the highest court of
that State, are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment as
offering no standard of conduct that it is possible to know in advance
and comply with.
147 Kentucky, 564; Id. 795; 148 Kentucky, 572, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of antitrust provisions of the constitution and laws of Kentucky,
are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Alexander Pope Humphrey and Mr. Edgar A. Bancroft, with whom Mr. Victor A. Remy was on the brief, for
plaintiff in error:
The construction placed on the anti-trust statutes by
the instructions of the lower-court violated the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The anti-trust statutes as construed are void for indefiniteness.' See act of May 20, 1890, §§ 3915 and 3917,
Ky. Stat.; § 198, Kentucky Const.; Ky. Stat., p. 145;

acts of March 21, 1906, p. 429 (Ky. Stat., §3941a), and
March 13, 1908, p. 38 (Ky. Stat., §3941a).
The Kentucky anti-trust law, as construed and enforced, denies equal protection of the law contrary to the
Fourteenth Amendment.
The instructions of the lower court placed a construc tion
on the Kentucky anti-trust law which conflicts with the
Fourteenth Amendment. They,- in effect, require superior
articles to be sold at the same prices as inferior, ones.
The Kentucky anti-trust statutes as construed by the
Court of Appeals are so indefinite that they are void as
criminal laws.
The Kentucky anti-trust statutes as construed and enforced deny equal'protection of the law.
The history of the laws and the decisions show the above
is true.
The fact that Kentucky is an agricultural State and
the "Night Riding" movement tend to show the purpose
of the acts.
The construction given the conflicting statutes gave
only an apparent equality to manufacturers and merchants as compared to farmers.
As a matter of fact, the laws as construed and enforced,
deny manufacturers and dealers equal protection.
The law itself must save the rights of parties, and they
cannot be left to the discretion of the courts.

MI. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error was prosecuted, convicted and
fined in three different counties for having entered into an
agreement with other named companies for the purpose
of controlling the price of harvesters, &c. manufactured
by them and of enhancing it above their real value; and
for having so fixed and enhanced the price, and for having
sold their harvesters, &c. at a price in excess of their
real value, in pursuance of the agreement alleged. The
judgments were affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 147

was cited for the proposition. But the case gives no
sanction to it. The point there was that a defect in a law
could not be cured by precautions in a judgment, not that
what seemed a defect could not be cured by the construction given to the words by the court having final authority
to declare their intent. We follow the Kentucky Court of
Appeals in taking what they derive from the legislation
of the State as if it were embodied in a single act.
The history in brief is this: By an act of May 20, 1890,
agreements for the purpose of fixing or limiting the amount
or quantity of any article of merchandise to be produced or
manufactured, mined, bought or sold; as also combinations
by corporations with others to put the business of the
combination under control with intent to limit, fix or
change the price of articles of commerce or in any way to
diminish the output of such articles, were made punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. Carroll's Kentucky
Statutes, §§ 3915, 3916, 3917. In 1891 a new constitution
was adopted by the State, by § 198 of which it was made
the duty of the General Assembly "from time to time, as
necessity may require, to enact such laws as may be
neuessary to prevent all trusts . . . from combining
to depreciate below its real value any article, or to enhance
the cost of any article above its real value." (This was
held not to repeal the earlier statute. Commonwealth v.
International Harvester Co., 131 Kentucky, 551, 566.)
But Kentucky grows tobacco and the farmers were
dissatisfied with the prices that they were able to get, being
oppressed as they alleged by a combination of buyers.
So, on March 21, 1906, a statute Was enacted that made it
lawful for any number of persons to combine the crops of
wheat, tobacco, corn, oats, hay, or other farm products
raised by them, for the purpose of obtaining a higher
price than they could get by selling them separately.
Session Laws, 1906, c. 117, p. 429. And later, byaIn'act of

INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO. v. KENTUCKY. 221
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

March 13, 1908 (Session Laws, 1908, c. 8, p. 38), not
only was the legality of these last mentioned combinations
reaffirmed, but they were protected by injunction, and the
sale by or purchase from the owner contrary to his agreement was punished by a fine.
When the Court of Appeals came to deal with the act of
1890, the constitution of 1891, and the act of 1906, it
reached the conclusion, which now may be regarded as the
established construction of the three taken together, that
by interaction and to avoid questions of constitutionality,
they were to be taken to make any combination for the
purpose of controlling prices lawful unless for the purpose
or with the effect of. fixing a price that was greater or
less than the real value of the article. Owen County Burley
Tobacco Society v. Brumback, 128 Kentucky, 137, 151.
Commonwealth v. InternationalHarvester Co. of America,
131 Kentucky, 551, 568, 571-573. InternationalHarvester
Co. of America v. Commonwealth, 137 Kentucky, 668. The
result seems to be that combinations of tobacco growers
are held to do no more than restore an equilibrium that
has been disturbed by a combination of buyers, Owen
County Burley Tobacco Society v. Brumback, 128 Kentucky,
137, 152; Collins v. Commonwealth, 141 Kentucky, 564,
whereas if prices rise after a combination of manufacturers it very nearly is presumed that the advance is
above the real value and, that there is a crhne. International Harvester Co. of America v. Commonwealth, 144
Kentucky, 403, 410, 411.
The plaintiff in error contends that the law as construed offers no standard of conduct that it is possible
to know. To meet this, in the present and earlier cases
the real value is declared to be 'its market value under
fair competition, and under normal market conditions.'

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

Kentucky, 668, 677, 678. We have to consider whether in
application this is more than an illusory form of words,
when nine years after it was incorporated, a combination
invited by the law is required to guess at its peril what its
product would have sold for -if the combination had not
existed and nothing else violently affecting values had
occurred. It seems that since 1902 the price of the machinery sold by the plaintiff in error has risen from ten to
fifteen per cent. The testimony on its behalf showed that
meantime the cost of materials used had increased from
20 to 25 per cent. and labor 271 per cent. Whatever
doubt there may be about the exact figures we hardly
suppose the fact of a rise to be denied. But in order to
reach what is called the real value, a price from which all
effects of the combination are to be eliminated; the plaintiff in error is told that it cannot avail itself of the rise in
materials because it was able to get them cheaper through
one of the subsidiary companies of the combination, and
that the saving through the combination more than offset
all the rise in cost.
This perhaps more plainly concerns the justice of the
law in its bearing upon the plaintiff in error, when compared with its operation upon tobacco raisers who are
said to have doubled or trebled their prices, than on the
constitutional question proposed. But it also concerns
that, for it shows how impossible it is to think away the
principal facts of the case as it exists and say what would
have, been the price in an imaginary world. Value is the
effect in exchange of the relative social desire for compared objects expressed in terms of a common denominator. It is a fact and generally is more or less easy to ascertain. But what it would be with such increase of a never
extinguished competition as it might be guessed would
have existed had the combination not been made, with
exclusion of the actual effect of other abnormal influences,
and, it would seem with exclusion also of any increased

Opinionk of the Court.

efficiency in the machines but with inclusion of the effect
of the combination so far as it was economically beneficial
to itself and the community, is a problem that no human
ingenuity could solve. The reason is not the general uncertainties of a jury trial but that the elements necessary
to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain both in
nature and degree of effect to the acutest commercial
mind. The very community, the intensity of whose wish
relatively to its other competing desires determines the
price that it would give, has to be supposed differently
organized and subject to other influences than those
under which it acts. It i.3 easy to put simple cases; but
the one before us is at least as complex as we have supposed, and the law must be judged by it. In our opinion
it cannot stand.
We regard this decision as consistent with Nash v.
United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377, in which it was held
that a criminal law is not unconstitutional merely because
it throws upon men the risk of rightly estimating a matter
of degree-what is an undue restraint of trade. That
deals with the actual, not with an imaginary condition
other than the facts. It goes no further than to recognize
that, as with negligence, between the two extremes of the
obviously illegal and the plainly lawful there is a gradual
approach and that the complexity of life.makes it impossible to draw a line in advance without an artificial simplification that would be unjust. The conditions are
as permanent as anything human, and a great body of
precedents on the civil side coupled with familiar practice
make it comparatively easy for common sense to keep to
what is safe. But if business is to go on, men must unite
to do it and must sell their wares. To compel them to
guess on peril of indictment what the community would
have given for them if the continually changing conditions
were other than they are, to an uncertain extent; to divine
prophetically what the reaction of only partially deter-

Nos. 372, 373.

Submitted May 7, 1914.-Decided June 8, 1914.

This court does not go behind the construction given to a state statute
by the state courts.
A state statute aimed at an evil and hitting it presumably where
experience shows it to be most felt is not unconstitutional under the
equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment because
.there might be other instances to which it might be equally well
applied.
It is for the legislature to determine to what classes a police statute
shall apply; and unless there is a clear case of discrimination the
courts will not interfere.
