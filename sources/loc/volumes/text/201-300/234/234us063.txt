ATLANTIC TRANESPORT CO. v. SZCZESEK.
231;W. S.

Statement of the Case.

in navigable waters, by one who has undertaken a maritime service, against one engaged in the performance of
that service, is not embraced within the constitutional
grant and the jurisdictional act, would be to establish a
limitation wholly without warrant.
The remaining question relates to the finding of negligence. It is urged that the neglect was that of a fellowservant and hence that the petitioner was not liable. Both
courts below, however, concurred in the finding, that the
petitioner omitted to use proper diligence to provide a
safe place of work. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh,
149 U. S. 368, 386. As the question belongs to a class
which under the distribution of judicial power is determinable by the Circuit Court of Appeals in last resort, we
shall not undertake to discuss it at length or to restate
the evidence. Chicago Junction Rwy. Co. v. King, 222
U. S. 222, 224; Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Rwy. Co. v. Brown,
229 U. S. 317, 320; Grand Trunk Rwy. Co. v. Lindsay, 233
U. S. 42, 50. It is sufficient to say that we are satisfied
from an examination of the record that the ruling was
justified.
Affirmed.
