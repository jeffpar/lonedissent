as time remained to finish the work had the contractor
not been prohibited from going on because the engineer
in charge was not satisfied with the progress of the job.
But the right to annul for the latter reason was a right
conferred by clause A, with the damages limited as therein
provided. The United States was precluded from the
rule of damages prescribed by clause B, and being forced
to justify under clause A was held bound by the limitation
of that clause.
The right to annul is expressly 'conferred by clause A
for a failure to begin on the stipulated day. The United
States resorted to that clause for its authority and pursued
the procedure therein pointed out. It is plainly bound
by the limitation of damages therein prescribed.
For the errorin not so confining the recovery, the judgment
is reversed and a new trial awarded.

ATLANTIC COAST LINE RAILROAD COMPANY v.
STATE OF GEORGIA.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF GEORGIA.
No. 24. Argued April 17, 1913.-Decided June 8, 1914.
The existence of difference of opinion as to which is the best form of
necessary safety device does not preclude the exercise of legislative
discretion; and so far as the question is simply one of expediency
the legislature is competent to decide it.
The criticism that a police statute requires a carrier to comply with
conditions beyond its control and, therefore, deprives it of its property without due process of law, is not open in this court if the state
court has construed the statute as not so requiring the carrier.
The state court having held that the term "railroad company" as used

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

in a state police statute is inclusive of natural persons operating a
railroad and that the statute is not unconstitutional as denying equal
protection of the law to railroad corporations because it does not include natural persons, this court concurs in that view.
A state police statute requiring railroad companies to use a specified
safety device is not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of
the laws because it does not affect receivers operating railroads; in
view of the temporary and special character of a receiver's management, the classification is reasonable and proper.
In the absence of legislation by Congress, the States may exercise their
powers to secure safety in the physical operation of railroad trains
within their territory, even though such trains are used in interstate'
commerce.
In regulating interstate trains as to matters in regard to which Congress has not acted, a State may not make arbitrary requirements as
to safety devices; but its requirements are not invalid as interfering
with interstate commerce because another State, in the exercise of
the same power, has imposed, or may impose, a diffferent requirement.
Congress may, whenever it pleases, make the rule and establish the
standard to be observed on interstate highways.
None of the safety appliance statutes enacted by Congress relate to or
regulate locomotive headlights.
The intent of Congress to supersede the exercise of the police power of
the States in respect to a subject on which it has not acted cannot be
inferred merely from the fact that such subject has been investigated under its authority.
The statute of Georgia of 1908, Civil Code, §§ 2697, 2698, requiring
railroad companies to use locomotive headlights of specified form and
power, is not unconstitutional either as a denial of equal protection
of the law, as deprivation of property without due process of law, or
as an interference with interstate commerce.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
Locomotive Headlight Law of Georgia, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Thomas S. Felder, Attorney General of the State of
Georgia, for defendant in error:
Statutes of States of the character of the one under
consideration, being designed for the protection of the
property and lives of the people, are not unconstitutional
because they may in a manner affect interstate commerce, nor do they violate the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution because an
expense may be incurred in obeying their regulations.

N. C. & St. L. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96.
The act does not violate the equal protection clause of
the Constitution because it excepts from its operations
tram, mill, and lumber roads. This would seem to be a
wise and reasonable classification. Chic., R. I. & Pac.

(Ark.); Chicago &c. R. Co. v. Railroad Com'rs, 90 N. E.
Rep. 1011.
The contention that the act exempts from its operations
railroads operated by receivers is not tenable. The act
does not by its terms exempt receivers of railroads. A
court would order its officer to comply with the terms of
the statute and equip the locomotives with the headlights required.
The statute does not interfere with the right of the railroad company to contract. New York & New England
R. Co. v. Bristol, 151 U. S. 556, 567; McGehee on Due
Process of Law, 345.
It is not a- taking of property without due process of
law, in contemplation of this provision of the Constitution, because the railroad, in order to comply with the
statute, would have to discard the headlights used by
it, which it considers are good headlights, and to replace
the same with the headlights required under the act. All
property is held subject to the police regulations of the
State. Chi., B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 561;

The legislature may prescribe in detail the kind of light
which should be used, and may also designate the size of
the reflector as well as the number of watts that should be
used. The intensity of an electric light is measured by the
watt, and the reflector increases the breadth and intensity
of the light, as was well known to the legislature. Chesapeake &c. v. Manning, 186 U. S. 238; Freund on Police
Power, § 34; Atchison &c. R. R. Co. v. Matthews, 174

policy of the Government is to be found in its statutes and
when the law-making power speaks upon a particular
subject over which it has constitutional power to legislate,
public policy in such cases is what the statute enacts.

States v. Freight Association, 166 U. S. 340; Chi., B. & Q.
R. R. Co. v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549, 569.
The subject has not been acted upon in any way by
Congress or by the Interstate Commerce Commission, directly or indirectly. The act does not in any way conflict
with any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, and in the absence
of such conflict the Federal courts will not declare the
act invalid as interfering with interstate commerce. Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 533; Mo. Pac. Ry- v. Larabee

MR. JUSTIcE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the
court.
The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, the plaintiff in error, was convicted of violating a statute of the
State of Georgia known as the 'headlight law.' Pub.
Laws (Ga.), 1908, pp. 50, 51; Civil Code, §§ 2697, 2698.
In defense it was insisted that the act contravened the
commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. On appeal from
the judgment of conviction the Court of Appeals of the
State of Georgia certified the questions thus raised, together with others involving the application of the state
constitution, to the Supreme Court of the State. Answering these questions, that court sustained the validity of
the statute (135 Georgia, 545), whereupon final judgment
was entered and this writ of error was sued out.
The material portions of the statute are as follows:

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. GEORGIA.
234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of
Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the
same, That all railroad companies are hereby required to
equip and maintain each and every locomotive used by
such company to run on its main line after dark with a
good and sufficient headlight which shall consume not less
than three hundred watts at the arc, and with a reflector
not less than twenty-three inches in diameter, and to
keep the same in good condition. The word main line
as used herein means all portions of the railway line not
used solely as yards, spurs and sidetracks.
"Section 2. Be it further ehacted, That any railroad
company violating this Act in any'respect shall be liable
to indictment as for a misdemeanor in any county in
which the locomotive not so equipped and maintained
may run, and on conviction shall be punished by fine as
prescribed in Section 1039 of the Code of 1895.
"Section 4. Provided this Act shall not apply to tram
roads, mill roads and roads engaged principally in lumber
or logging transportation in connection with mills."
The contention is made that this act deprives the company of its liberty of contract, and of its property, without
due process of law. It compels the disuse of a material
part of the company's present equipment and the substitution of a new appliance. The use of locomotive headlights, hbwever, is directly related to safety in operation.
It cannot be denied that the protective power of government, subject to which the carrier conducts its business
and manages its property, extends as well to the regulation of this part of the carrier's equipment as to apparatus
for heating cars or to automatic couplers. The legislature may require an adequate headlight, and whether
the carrier's practise is properly conducive to safety, or a
new method affording greater protection should be substituted, is a matter for the legislative judgment. But
it is insisted that the legislature has gone beyond the

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

limits of its authority in making the specific requirements
contained in the act as to the character and power of the
light and the dimensions of the reflector. This argument
ignores the established principle that if its action is not
arbitrary-is reasonably related to a proper purposethe legislature may select the means which it deems to be
appropriate to theend to be achieved. It is not bound
to content itself with general directions when it considers
that more detailed measures are. necessary to attain a
legitimate object. Particularization has had many familiar illustrations in cases where there has been a conviction
of the need 'of it, a8, for example, in building regulations
and in provisions for safeguarding persons in the use of
dangerous machinery. So far as governmental power is
concerned, we know of no ground for an exception in
the case of a locomotive headlight:
It cannot be said that the legislature acted arbitrarily
in prescribing electric light, in preference to others, or
that, having made this selection, it was not entitled to
impose minimum requirements to be observed in the use
of the light. Witnesses for the plaintiff in error, iricluding
its general superintendent of motive power and other employ6s -holding important positions and conversant with
the exigencies of operation, presented their objections to
the use of the electric headlight. Locomotive engineers
who for many years had driven locomotives with such a
light testified for the State, expressing a decided opinion
in favor of the use of electric headlights in the interest of
safe operation and submitting their views in answer to
the objections that had been urged. Assuming that there
is room for differences of opinion, this fact does not preclude the exercise of the legislative discretion. So far
as the question was one simply of expediency-as to the
best method to provide the desired security-it was within
the competency of the legislature to decide it. N. Y. &
N. E. R. R. Co. v. Bristol, 151 U. S. 556, 571; C., B. & Q.

R. R. Co. v. McGuire, 219 U. S. 549, 568, 569, and cases
there cited.
As to the objection that the statute makes no provision
for conditions beyond the carrier's control, it is sufficient
to say that in the light of the construction placed upon
the act by the Supreme Court of the State, we are not at
liberty to regard it as open to this criticism (135 Georgia,
pp. 561, 562); certainly, no such case is here presented.
We conclude that there is no valid objection to the statute
upon the ground that it deprives the carrier of liberty or
property without due process of law.
The further contention is that the statute offends in
denying to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of
the laws. Specifically, the complaint is that the act does
not apply to receivers operating railroads, and that it expressly excepts tram roads, mill roads and roads engaged
principally in lumber or logging transportation in connection with mills. As to the first, it cannot be said that the
act does exclude receivers from its requirements. The
state court has ruled that the words 'railroad company'
in the statute include natural persons as well as corporations. It declined to decide that receivers were not included; but, concedifig, without deciding, that they were
not, it was held that the .statute would not for that reason
violate the equal protection clause in view of the temporary and'special character of receivers' management.
135 Georgia, pp. 555, 556. We concur in this view. As
to the exceptions made by the statute of tram roads, mill
roads, etc., it is impossible to say that the differences
,with respect to operation and traffic conditions did not
present a reasonable basis for classification. Lindsley v.
Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78, 81; Barrett v.
Indiana, 229 U. S. 26,. 30; German Alliance Ins. Co. v.
Kansas, 233 U. S..389, 418.
voL. ccxxxiv-19.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.
Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

Finally, it is urged that the statute constitutes an unwarrantable interference with interstate commerce. The
locomotive, with respect to which the accusation was
made, was at the time being regularly used in the hauling
of interstate freight trains over the company's main line
of railroad and was equipped with an oil headlight. The
statute, as the Supreme Court of the State said, was not
directed against interstate commerce, but it was held that
it incidentally applied to locomotives used in hauling
interstate trains while these were moving on the main
line in the State of Georgia. This being so, the act is
said to be repugnant to the exclusive power of Congress.
It is argued that if Georgia may prescribe an electric headlight, other States through which the road runs may require headlights of a different sort; that, for example,
some may demand the use of acetylene and that others
may require oil; and that, if state requirements conflict,
it will be necessary to carry additional apparatus and to
make various adjustments at state lines which would
delay and inconvenience interstate traffic.
The argument is substantially the same as that which
was strongly presented to the court in New York, New
Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. New York, 165 U. S.628,
where the plaintiff in error was held subject to penalty
for the violation of a New York statute which in sub.stance made it unlawful for any steam railroad doing
business in that State to heat its passenger cars, on any
other than mixed trains, by any stove or furnace
kept
inside of the car or suspended therefrom. The railroad
company was a Connecticut corporation having but a
few miles of road within the State of New York and
operating through trains from New York through Connecticut to Massachusetts. As this court said in its opinion,
the argument was made that .'a conflict between state
regulations in respect of the heating of passenger cars
used in interstate commerce would make safe and rapid

ATLANTIC COAST LINE v. GEORGIA.
234 U. S.

291

Opinion of the. Court.

transportation impossible; that to stop an express train
on its trip from New York to Boston at the Connecticut
line in order that passengers may leave the cars heated
as required by New York, and get into other cars heated
in a different mode in conformity with the laws of Connecticut, and then at the Massachusetts line to get into
cars heated by still another mode as required by the laws
of that Commonwealth, would be a hardship on travel
that could not be endured.' But the court ruled that
these 'possible inconveniences' could not affect 'the question of power in each State to make such reasonable regulations for the safety of passengers on interstate trains
as in its judgment, all things considered is appropriate
and effective.' 165 U. S. 632, 633.
In thus deciding, the court applied the settled principle
that, in the absence of legislation by Congress, the States
are not denied the exercise. of their power to secure safety
in the physical operation of railroad trains within their
territory, even though such trains are used in interstate
commerce. That has been the law since the beginning
of railroad transportation. It was not intended that pending Federal action the use of such agencies, which unless
carefully guarded was fraught with danger to the community, should go unregulated and that the States should be
without authority to secure needed local protection. The
requirements of a State, of course, must not be arbitrary
or pass beyond the limits of a fair judgment as to what
the exigency demands, but they are not invalid because
another State in the exercise of a similar power may not
impose the same regulation. We may repeat what was
said in Smith v. Alabama,,124 U. S.465, 481, 482: "It is
-to be remembered that railroads are not natural highways
of trade and commerce.
. .
The places where they
may be located, and the plans according to which they
must be constructed, are prescribed by the legislation of
the State. Their operation requires the use of instruments

and agencies attended with special risks and dangers,
the proper management of which involves peculiar knowledge, training, skill, and care. The safety of the public in
person and property demands the use of specific guards and
precautions. . . . The rules prescribed for their construction and for their management and operation, designed
to protect persons and property, otherwise endangered by
their use, are strictly within the limits of the local law.
They are not per se regulations of commerce; it is only
when they operate as such in the circumstances of their application, and conflict with the expressed or presumed will
of Congress exerted on the same subject, that they can be
required to give way to the supreme authority of the Constitution." See also, Nashville &c. Rwy. Co. v. Alabama,
128 U. S. 96; Hennington v. Georgia, 163 U. S.299; N. Y.,
N. H. & H. R. R. Co. v. New York, supra; Lake Shore &
M. S. Rwy. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285; Missouri Pacific

Rwy. Co. v. Arkansas, 219 U. S.453; Minnesota Rate Cases,
230 U. S.352, 402, 410.
If there is a conflict in such local regulations, by which
interstate commerce may be inconvenienced-if there
appears to be need of standardization of safety appliances
and of providing rules of operation which will govern
the entire interstate road irrespective of state boundaries
-there is a simple remedy; and it cannot be assumed
that it will not be readily applied if there be real occasion
for it. That remedy does not rest in a denial to the State,
in the absence of conflicting Federal action, of its power to
protect life and property within its borders, but it does lie
in the exercise of the paramount authority of Congress in its
control of interstate commerce to establish such regulations
as in its judgment may be deemed appropriate and sufficient. Congress, when it pleases, may give the rule and make
the standard to be observed on the interstate highway.

It is suggested that Congress has acted in the present instance. Reference is made to the act of March 2, 1893,
c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, relating to power driving-wheel brakes
for locomotives, grabirons, automatic couplers and height
of drawbars; to the act of March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat.
943, amending the act of 1893; to the act of May 27, 1908,
c. 200, 35 Stat. 317, 324, 325, authorizing the Interstate
Commerce Commission to keep informed regarding compliance with the Safety Appliance Act and to investigate
and report on the need. of any appliances or systems intended to promote the safety of railway operations; to
the act of May 30, 1908, c. 225, 35 Stat. 476, relating to
locomotive ash pans; to the act of April 14, 1910, c. 160,
36 Stat. 298, relating to sill steps, hand brakes, ladders,
running boards and hand 'holds and providing that the
Interstate Commerce Commission should after hearing
designate the number, dimensions, location and manner
of application of these appliances and of those required by
the act of 1893; to the detailed regulations prescribed
by the Commission, on March 13, 1911, pursuant to this
authority; to the act of May 6, 1910, c. 208, 36 Stat. 350,
requiring the Commission to investigate accidents and
make report as to their causes with such recommendations
as they may deem proper; and to the act of February 17,
1911, c. 103, 36 Stat. 913, relating to locomotive boilers.
. But it is manifest that none of these acts provides
regulations for locomotive headlights. Attention is also called
to the investigations conducted by what is known as
the 'block-signal and train control 'board (organized by
the Commission) and the reports of that board with respect to sundry devices and appliances, including headlights. It does not appear, 'however, either that Congress
has acted or that the Commission under the authority
of Congress has established any regulation so far as headlights are concerned. As to these, the situation has not
been altered by any exertion of Federal power and the

case stands as it has always stood without regulation unless it be supplied by local authority. The most that can
be said is that inquiries have been made, but that Congress
has not yet decided to establish regulations, either directly
or through its subordinate body, as to the appliance in
question. The intent to supersede the exercise of the
State's police power with respect to this subject cannot
be inferred from the restricted action which thus far has
been taken. Missouri Pacific v. Larabee Mills, supra;

The judgment is affirmed.
Affirmed.

THE LOS ANGELES SWITCHING CASE. 1
APPEAL FROM THE COMMERCE COURT.

No. 98. Argued January 14, 15, 1914.-Decided June 8, 1914.
An order of the Interstate Commerce Commission requiring railway
companies to desist from exacting charges for delivering and receiving
carload freight to and from industries located upon spurs and sidetracks within the switching limits of a terminal city when such carload freight is moving in interstate commerce incidentally to a
system line haul is not open to the objection that it rests upon a
construction of the Act to Regulate Commerce which would forbid
a carrier from separating its terminal and haulage charges on the
same shipment.
Quwre, and not involved in this decision, whether the rate which the
Act to Regulate Commerce requires to be published is a complete
rate including not only the charge for hauling but also the charge
for the use of terminals at both ends of the line.
I Docket title of this case is Interstate Commerce Commission, The
United States of America, Associated Jobbers of Los Angeles, and
Pacific Coast Jobbers and Manufacturers Association, appellants, v.
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company, Southern Pacific
Company, and San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad
Company.
