whose validity we are to consider, and while it made no special findings, its statement of what was before it for consideration and its conclusions therefrom are sufficient to sustain its judgment. True the record fails to show how the
facts were brought to its knowledge, but it is the highest court
of the State, and we may not ignore its recital of what it considered, especially as it appears that testimony was in fact
taken. Egan v. Hart, 165 U. S. 188. And when its conclusions are in harmony with the general rule of the effect to
be given to a patent of the United States we are not justified
in setting aside the judgment upon any presumption of what
might have been the testimony upon which the trial court
made its findings.

ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 67. Argued October 29, 1906.-Decided. November 12, 1906.
A mistaken view of the law may constitute probable cause in some instances-probable cause does mean sufficient cause-so held as to a suit
for infringement of registered trade-mark.
Although the opinion of the highest court of a State may be resorted to
for the purpose of showing that the court actually dealt vith a Federal question presented by the record, or that a right asserted in general terms was maintained and dealt with on Federal groulids, where
the record discloses no Federal question until the assignment of errors
in this court, it comes too late and the writ will be dismissed.

Appeals reversing the temporary injunction, nor the judgment upon the merits in the injunction suit in favor of these
plaintiffs, have any tendency to support the decision stated
in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. That decision is
directly contrary to both.
The decision could not have been rested ()n oral evidence,
because there was no evidence in the case tending to support
the decision. All the oral 'evidence tended to show want of
probable cause and want of good faith, and the opinion refers
to it, but refuses it any weight.
The defense of probable cause isonly made out when defendant shows that he began his action or proceeding in good
faith with the honest belief that he was entitled to maintain
it, and with reasonable grounds for such belief. Add. on Torts

Argument for Defendant in Error.

All the proceedings in the United States Circuit Court in the
injunction suit, including the judgments and orders, and opiniions, were pleaded and in evidence, and a part of the record.
They were before the Court of Appeals. Green Bay Co. v. Patton Co., 172 U. S. 58, 66; Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657.
A failure or refusal to consider the Federal question is
equivalent to a decision against the Federal right involved
therein. Des Moines Nay.Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U. S.
552; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Elliott, 184 U. S.531.
If a Federal question appears in the record and was actually
decided, or was necessarily involved in the decision as made by
the state court, this court has jurisdiction. Brown v. Atwell,
92 U. S. 327; Power Co. v. Electric Co., 172 U. S.475, 488;
Wedding v. Meyler, 192 U. S.573; Powell v. Brunswick Co., 150

In the case at bar the previous judgment of the Federal
court, between the same parties, was alleged in the complaint
herein and alleged to have been a judgment upon the merits.
Mr. Milton A. Fowler for defendant in error:
This court has no jurisdiction; there is no suggestion in
the pleadings that any Federal question is involved; neither
was there any claim presented in the state courts by exception or otherwise which involved any such question.
Did the defendant have probable cause for believing that
the plaintiffs were infringing, arising from his long use of his
peculiar design, and the frequent adjudication of the courts,
both state and Federal in his favor thereupon. Letters alone
may be and frequently are a legal trade-mark. Brown on

The uniform decisions of the courts in favor of the defendant
could have left no reasonable doubt in his mind that the
plaintiffs herein were infringers.
The facts being undisputed and resting upon plaintiff's own
evidence, the question as to whether plaintiff in the injunction action had probable cause for bringing the same is one,
of law. Lord Mansfield, 1 Term Reports, 544; Humphries v.
Parker,52 Maine, 502; Ash v. Marlowe, 20 Ohio, 119; Stewart v.

14 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 1st ed., 5.
The Court of Appeals did not err in deciding as a matter
of law, that the defendant had probable cause to commence
the action and procure the injunction, because the packages
and drops of the plaintiff resembled his own so closely s to
be calculated to deceive the careless and unwary, and that
the average purchaser would not know the difference. Coleman v. Crump, 70 N. Y. 573; Carl v. Ayres, 53 N. Y. 14, 17.
Actions for malicious prosecution of civil actions are not

The decree of the Circuit Court of the United States, that

Opinion of the Court.

there was an infringement upon the registered trade-mark
and unfair competition, is sufficient evidence of prqbable
cause for the prosecution of the suit to make due and complete defense to this action for malicious prosecution. The
fact that the Circuit Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion does not in any degree lessen the effect of the decision
of Judge Coxe as evidence of probable cause. Crescent City
Live Stock Co. v. Butchers' Union, 120 U. S. 141, 158; Spring v.
Besore, 12 B. Mon. 551, 555; Short & Co. v. Spriggins & Co.,
104 Georgia, 628; Clements v. Odorless Excavating Co., 69
Maryland, 461; Hartshornv. Smith, 104 Georgia, 235.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action for malicious prosecution brought by the
plaintiffs in error, in which the New York Court of Appeals
ordered judgment for the defendant in error. 181 N. Y. 1.
The suit complained of was a bill brought by the defendant
in error in the United States Circuit Court to restrain the
infringement of a registered trade-mark. A preliminary
injunction was granted in that suit. An appeal was taken
to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the injunction was
dissolved, and, the plaintiff making default at the final hearing, a decree was enteredby the Circuit Court, expressed to be
upon the merits, and dismissing the bill. The special damage
alleged in the present action is the interruption' of .the plaintiff's business by the injunction while it was in force.
In the case at bar the trial court ordered a nonsuit
on the
Circuit
by
the
injunction
of
the
ground that. the granting
Court established probable cause. The principle of the
decision in Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House
Co. v. Butchers' Union Slaughter-House & Live-Stock Landing
Co., 120 U. S. 141, that a final decree of the Circuit Court has
that effect, even if subsequently' reversed, was thought to
extend to a preliminary decree. See -also Deposit Bank v.
'Frankfort, 191 U. S. 499, 511. The decision of the trial court

203 U. S.

was reversed by the Appellate Division. The defendant then
took the case to the Court of Appeals, assenting, as required,
that, if the order should be affirmed, judgment absolute
should be rendered against him. As we have said, the order
was reversed. The ground on which a review is asked here
is that the Court of Appeals by its reasoning implies that it
finds probable cause in its own opinion that the decree in
the former case was wrong, whereas not to assume it to be
correct is to fail to give it the faith and credit required by
Rev. Stats. § 905.
It is unnecessary to consider whether a court bound by a
previous judgment would not be warranted in saying that if
the question had come before it in the first instance it would
have decided the case the other way, and therefore that there
was probable cause for a mistake of law into which it would
have fallen itself. A mistaken view of the law may constitute probable cause in some instances, as is shown by the case
cited above. Probable cause does not mean sufficient cause.
But this last proposition shows that the former decree could
not have decided the qesetion now before the court, and therefore that the case is not properly here. The former decree
was conclusive on the merits of the suit in which it was rendered, of course, Lyon y. Perin & Goff Manuf. Co., 125 U. S. 698,
but it only decided that that'suit was brought without sufficient cause. It decided nothing as to whether the plaintiff
had probable cause for expecting to prevail. If the Court of
Appeals had affirmed the judgment of the trial court for the
reason that a preliminary injunction fairly obtained from any
court conclusively established probable cause, or that there
was no evidence of a want of it, there would have been nothing to bring here, whether that reason was right ,or wrong.
The only ground on which our jurisdiction is maintained is
that the opinion of the Court of Appeals 'shows that it gave a
different and inadmissible reason for the result to which it
came.
No doubt an opinion may be resorted to for the purpose of

BURT v. SMITH.

Opinion of the Court.

showing that a court actually dealt with a question presented
by the record, or that a right asserted in general terms was
maintained and dealt with on Federal grounds. Missouri,
Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Elliott, 184 U. S. 530, 534; San
Jos6 Land & Water Co. v. San Jos6 Ranch Co., 189 U. S. 177,
179, 180; German Savings & Loan Society v. Dormitzer, 192
U. S. 125. But it would be going further than we are prepared to go if we took jurisdiction upon the ground stated in
this case. Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126, 137. The'record
discloses no question under the Constitution or laws of the
United States until we come to the assignment of errors in
this court. Then it was too late. Hulbert v. Chicago, 202
U. S. 275, 280. It is true that the complainant alleged the
decree, but that was merely to show that the litigation complained of was. ended, as was required by the law of New
York, Marks v. Townsend, 97 N. V. p90, 595, not to suggest a
Federal question, which at that moment probably was not
dreamed of. Even the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which
is not part of the record in New York, does not disclose that
there had been presented to it any argument or claim of right
based upon the effect due to the previous final decree under
the Revised Statutes, or indeed, in a specific way, upon the
effect of the decree in any light. Furthermore, notwithstanding a few broad words relied upon by the plaintiff in error, we
doubt if the Court of Appeals meant to lay down the proposition which we have said that we would not discuss, or to go
further than to decide that the whole evidence was not. sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to go to the jury in an action for
malicious prosecution, as that action is limited in New York.
It is argued that the Court of Appeals exceeded its functions under the constitution of the State, and in that way
denied the plaintiffs due process of law. We see no reason
to think so, but with that question we-have nothing to do.
