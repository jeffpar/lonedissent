of action not given by the laws of that State, and had no immunity exempting him from the control of the state legislation.
The proposition that the statute denied to the plaintiff in
error the equal protection of the laws because it "capriciously,
arbitrarily, and unnaturally," by the classification made,
deprived railway mail clerks of the rights of passengers which
they might have enjoyed if the statute had not been enacted,
is without merit. The classification ma.Rl by the statute
does not alone embrace railway mail clerks, but places in a
class by themselves such clerks and others whose employment
in and about a railroad subjec't them to greater peril than
passengers in the strictest sense. This general difference
renders it impossible in reason to say, within the meaning of
the Fourteenth Amendment, that the legislature of Pennsylvania, in classifying passengers in the strict sense in one class,
and those who are subject to greater risks, including railway
mail clerks, in another, acted so arbitrarily as to violate the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Judgment affirmed.

NATIONAL LIVE STOCK BANK OF CHICAGO v. FIRST
NATIONAL BANK OF GENESEO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF OKLAHOMA.
No. 33.

Argued October 17, 18, 1906.-Decided December 3, 1906.

The proper way to review judgments in actions at law of the Supreme Court
of the Territory of Oklahoma where the case was tried without a jury is
by writ of error, not by appeal.
The objection that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma found no facts upon
which a review can be had by this court is untenable, where it appears that
*the case was before that court a second time and that in its opinion it
referred to and adopted its former opinion in which it had made a full
statement and findings of fact.
The endorsement and delivery before maturity of a note secured by a chattel
mortgage by the payee transfers not only the note but by operation of law

the ownership of the mortgage which has no separate existence; and such a
chattel mortgage. if recorded, although the assignment thereof was not
recorded, remains a lien on the property, superior to that of subsequent
mortgages even though the original payee may, without authority and
after the transfer, have released the same, if the law of the State in which
the mortgage was given does not require the assignment of chattel mortgages to be recorded.
Under the law of Kansas there is no statute making it necessary to record or
file the assignment of a chattel mortgage in order to protect the rights of
the assignee thereof.
An assignee does not lose his rights under a mortgage by not recording or-.
filing it, unles.3 there is a law which either in express terms or by implication provides therefor; where there is no such statute it is not necessary,
nor is it the duty of the assignee to record or file a mortgage..
The rights of the holder of a chattel mortghge over the poperty after the
same has been removed to another State are determined by the law of
the State where the property was when the mortgage was given.
THis

is an action of replevin, brought by the plaintiff in error

against the defendant in error, in the District Court of Woodward County in the then Territory of Oklahoma, to recover
possession of certain cattle, once belonging to one W. B. Grimes
and by him mortgaged. The trial resulted in a judgment for
the defendant, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
Territory, and the plaintiff has brought the case here by writ
of error.

The action has been twice tried.

The first trial ended in a

judgment for the plaintiff., Upon appeal to the Supreme Court.

of the Territory it was reversed and the case remanded, anda
second trial had,. resulting in the judgment for defendant now
under review. Upon the second appeal to the Supreme Court,
of the Territory a brief opinion was given, in which it was stated
that upon appeal from' the first judgment the court had "pro-

mulgated an opiniori, in which it made a full statement and
findings of facts -and enunciated the, law as applied thereto,
reversed the judgment of the lower court, and remanded the.
case, directing a new' trial." 76 Pac. Rep. 130.... The court

also stated in its opinion on the second appeal that it had been
agreed upon between the parties in the trial court that a jury
should be waived and the case submitted on the record as made.

on the first trial, and that "no new question is raised on this
appeal. The record is the same as stated in our former opinion,
and we are fully satisfied with the. law as therein declared.
The judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed at the cost
of appellant."
The following facts were found by the Supreme Court on
the first appeal, and were adopted by it as the facts for review
on the second appeal:
One W. B. Grimes, who at the time was a resident of Clark
County, in Kansas, executed at that place, on the twentyseventh day of June, 1900, and delivered to Siegel-Sanders
Live Stock Commission Company his .negotiable promissory
note for $11,111;23, due November 1, 1900, with interest from
maturity at the rate of eight per cent per annum. To secure
the payment of this note he executed and delivered a chattel
mortgage to the payee of the note on five hundred and twentysix cattle then in the county, and the mortgage was duly filed
in the office of the register of deeds of Clark County on July 12,
1900. The note was then indorsed and delivered by the payee
to the Geneseo Bank, the defendant in error. It does not
appear that there was any separate assignment of the mortgage.
No record of any assignment was ever made in the register's
office of Clark County, Kansas. On the twenty-fourth day of
November, 1900, although the Siegel-anders Company had
already sold and delivered the note for $11,111.23 to the
Geneseo Bank, the defendant in error, yet notwithstanding
such sale the president of that company, Frank Siegel, without
any authority, filed in the offioe of the register of deeds -a pretended release of the mortgage, in which payment of the above
debt was acknowledged.
On the twenty-fifth day of February, 1901, the Chicago
Cattle Loan Company caused its agent to examine the records
of Clark County as to chattel mortgages against Grimes, and
upon this examination he found the record clear, except as to
a mortgage executed by Grimes to the Siegel-Sanders Live
Stock Company, October 24, 1900, and by it assigned to the

NAT'L LIVE STOCK BANK v. FIRST NAT'L BANK. 299

Statement of the Case.

Chicago Cattle Loan Company, and True so reported to the
last-named company.
On April 17, 1901, Grimes executed two other notes to the
Siegel-Sanders Company for $7,694.70 each, due October 27,
1901. These notes were probably renewals of notes previously
given. To secure the payment of these two notes Grimes at
the same time executed and delivered a chattel mortgage to
the Siegel-Sanders Company on the cattle in question and other
cattle. The two notes thus given were then sold by that company to the plaintiff in error for the amount named in the notes,
and the plaintiff believed at the time it bought these notes
that the mortgage securing them was the first lien on the cattle,
and it secured this information through its agent, who personally examined the record.
It is further stated in the finding that there was practically
no dispute as to the facts, and that the trial court expressly
found that both parties to this action acted in good faith.
The release of the first mortgage, signed by the president of
the Live Stock Commission Company and filed in the office of
the register of deeds, as above stated, on November 24, 1900,
was not acknowledged.
After the execution of these various instruments, and between the twenty-fifth of April and the first of May, 1901,
without the knowledge or consent of either of the banks,
parties to this suit, Grimes, the original owner of the cattle,
moved them from the State of Kansas to the county of Woodward, in the Territory of Oklahoma, at which latter place,
between the nineteenth and twentieth of May, 1901, they were
seized and taken possession of by the Geneseo Bank, the defendant. The plaintiff, within one year from the filing of the
first mortgage, dated June 27, 1900, in the office of the register
of deeds of Clark County, Kansas, commenced this suit in
replevin in the District Court of Woodward County, Oklahoma,
to recover possession of the cattle, claiming under the mortgage
which was executed and delivered to the Siegel-Sanders Company on April 17, 1901, and by it sold to plaintiff; while the

defendant claimed under the mortgage dated June 27, 1900,
a pretended release of which had been filed as already stated,
but after the assignment to defendant.
Upon these facts, as found by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, judgment was rendered for the defendant in error.
Mr. Silas H. Strawn, with whom, Mr. Frederick S. Winston,
Mr. John Barton Payne, Mr. Ralph M. Shaw, Mr. Blackburn
Esterline and Mr. Earle W. Evans were on the brief, for
plaintiff in error:
The failure of the Geneseo Bank to take and record an assignment of the chattel mortgage left it within the power of the
commission company to release the same of record. The
Geneseo Bank should abide by the consequences of its negligence and sustain the loss, as it is the law that when one of
two innocent parties must suffer, the loss should be borne by
him through whose negligence it was brought about. Dassler's

error:

Even if this case were here on appeal instead of by writ of
error, this court is without jurisdiction to consider the case,
because there is no finding of facts in the nature of a special
verdict by either th- Supreme Court of Oklahoma or the District Court of Woodward County, Oklahoma. This is necessary
to give this court jurisdiction. The statement of facts in the
opinion, of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the first hearing
does not constitute a finding of facts in the nature of a special
verdict. Dickinson v., Bank, 16 Wall. 250; Lahner v. Dickson,

Section 4246 of the Chattel Mortgage Law of Kansas, Dassler's
Stat., 1901, p. 896, provides that every holder of a mortgage
may keep his mortgage alive by filing an affidavit during the
last thirty days of the year following the recording of his mortgage, and the Chicago Bank having taken its mortgage within
the year and before the time had arrived when the Geneseo
Bank could file the affidavit contemplated by that provision,

The Chattel Mortgage Law of Kansas, in all its provisions,
recognizes the transferee of a negotiable note secured by a
chattel mortgage as the "assignee," where the word "assignee"
is used in that statute. Secs. 4068, 4069, p. 844, of Dassler's
Kans. Stat., 1899.
After the original mortgagee of a chattel mortgage indorses
and transfers the negotiable note secured by the mortgage,
he has no beneficial interest in the mortgage and cannot maintain an action of replevin or trover in his own name, but such
action must be brought by the transferee of the negotiable
promissory note as the real holder and owner of the note and
mortgage and therefore as being the "assignee" within the
meaning of the Kansas chattel mortgage statute. Bohart v.
Buckington, 62 Kansas, 658; Wiscum v. Huberly, 51 Kansas,

The release of the mortgage of the Geneseo Bank was void
because the same was not acknowledged. It was improperly
recorded for that reason. The contentions of defendant in

Opinion of the Court.

all respects are sustained by First National Bank v. Baird,
141 Fed. Rep. 862.
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The defendant in error, at the outset, objects to the jurisdiction of this court on the ground that the plaintiff should have
brought the case here by appeal instead of by writ of error,
because the case was tried without a jury, and, therefore, the
writ of error was improper. There is nothing in this objection,
as in actions at law coming from the Territory of Oklahoma
it has been held that the proper way to review the judgments of
the Supreme Court of that Territory was by writ of error.
Comstock v. Eagleton, 196 U. S. 99; Oklahoma City v. McMaster,
196 U. S. 529; Guss v. Nelson, 200 U. S.298.
Further objection is made that the court below found no
facts upon which a review can be had in this court. The
foregoing statement disposes of this objection also, and shows
it to be untenable.
On the merits, the question arises which of these two parties
shall sustain the loss occasioned by the improper act of the
president of the Live Stock Commission Company in signing
this pretended release, and acknowledging the payment of
the eleven thpusand dollar note, as above stated? The plaintiff in error contends that the defendant bank should bear the
loss because of its failure to record or file the assignment to it
of the first mortgage, securing the eleven thousand dollar note.
The defendant opposes this view and insists that, being the
holder and the owner of the eleven thousand dollar note,
secured by a first mortgage duly executed on the twentyseventh of June, 1900, and duly filed inthe register's office, it
has the prior right to the cattle, and that the statutes of Kansas
do not require that it should file or record the assignment to
it of the note and mortgage, and its claim should not, therefore,
be postponed.

The note executed by Grines' for .eleven thousand and -some
odd dollars was negotiable, and the chattel nor.tgage Wiva given
at that time to secure the payment of the note. The indorsement of the note and its delivery before niaturity to the. defendant by the payee of the note t-ransferr~d~fits 'ov~nership to
the defendant bank. This transfer also transferred, -by operation of law, the ownerslip of the mortgage-which, w~s;collatcral

The mortgage, therefore, is a prior lien upon, the cattle, as
security for the payment of the note, unless. defendant has. lost
it by its failure to record an assignment of, the mortgage.
Whether it has or not is to be determined by the law of Kansas.
There is no express provision in the statutes of Kansas, for
the filing or recording of assignments ,of.'chattel.-,mortgages.
Paragraph 36, section 4251, General Statutes of' Kansas. for
1901, by Dassler, may be found in the margin.' Itis said
this statute by implication provides for theiecording of an
assignment of a chattel mortgage.
Assuming that the statute makes provision for such -recording, it is then argued that it is the duty of the assignee .to do
1 Paragraph 36, Section 4251, General Statutes of Kansas for 1901,, by
Dassler, provides as follows:
"When any.mortgage of personal property shall have been fully paid' or
satisfied, it shall be the duty of the mortgagee, his assigns or personal representative, to enter satisfaction or cause satisfaction, thereof to be entered of
record in the same manner as near as may be, and under the same penalty
for a neglect or refusal, as provided in case of a satisfaction ofimortgages of
real estate. The entry of satisfaction shall be'made in the book. in which
the mortgage is entered, as hereinbefore provided; and any instrument acknowledging satisfaction shall not be recorded at length,tbut shal.be referred to under the head of 'Remarks,' and filed with'the mortgage or copy
thereof, and preserved therewith in the office of the register.'

It is true -that these cases ,refer to realF.estate mortgages, but
the reasoning sustains thetstatenint as to chattel mortgages.
The. first :of ,th-e iabove cases (Burhans v. Hutcheson) holds
that where a mortgage upon real 'estatei is given to secure

and mortgage are transferred by indorsement of the'npte to a
bona fide holder, the assignment, if there be a written one, need
not be recorded. This is held even where there was'an express
statute as to the record of such an assignment. The statute
was held not to apply to the case of a mortgage given as collateral to a negotiable note.
The second case (Wiscomb v. Cubberly) has reference also
to a mortgage on real estate, and involves much the same
principle.
In the third case (Mutual Life Insurance Benefit Co. v.
Huntington) it was again held that after the assignment and
delivery by the payee of a negotiable promissory note, before
maturity, together with the mortgage on real estate given as
collateral security for its payment, the original mortgagee
had no power to release or discharge the lien of the mortgage,
and a release made by him without authority, even though
the assignment was not recorded, would not affect the rights
of the assignee.
These cases would seem to establish the rule in Kansas that
it is not necessary to record the assignment of a mortgage
even upon real estate, when given to secure payment of negotiable notes, although there is a statute which in general terms
provides for the recording of assignments of real estate mortgages. Still stronger, if possible, is the case of a chattel
mortgage given to secure the payment of negotiable notes,
when there is no statutory provision for the recording of the
assignment of such mortgage. It is probable that in the large
majority of cases the only evidence of an assignment of a
negotiable note and a chattel mortgage given to secure its
payment is the indorsement of the note and delivery Ahereof
to the purchaser. In such a case there would be no assignment to record, and there is no provision in the statute for
filing a copy of the note with its indorsement, together with a
statement that it had been delivered to a, third party, as the
purchaser or assignee thereof.
'The policy of. the State of Kansas seems to be not alone to

give to a negotiable promissory note all the qualities that pertain to commercial paper, but also to clothe mortgages given as
collateral security for the payment of such hotes, with the
same facility of transfer as the note itself, to which it is only
an incident.
The plaintiff, however, contends for the opposite doctrine,
and cites, among others, Lewis v. Kirk, 28 Kansas, 497, as
its authority. In that case the question was which should
suffer, a bona fide purchaser of the real estate which had
been mortgaged, or the bona fide purchaser of the mortgage
who had failed to have his assignment recorded. The court
held in favor of the purchaser of the real estate, and distinguished Burhans v. Hvtcheson, supra, though not assuming
to overrule it. The mortgage in the Lewis case was upon real
estate, and would not, therefore, necessarily affect the case of
a chattel mortgage, where there is no statute for recording an
assignment of the mortgage.
But in Insurance Company v. Huntington, 57 Kansas, supra,
the case of Burhans v. Hutcheson, 25 Kansas, supra, was cited,
and the doctrine that a bona fide holder of negotiable paper,
transferred by, him by indorsement thereon before maturity,
and secured by a real estate mortgage, need not record the
assignment of mortgage, was again approved.
In Thomas V. Reynolds, 29 Kansas, 304, cited by plaintiff,
it was held that an .action to recover the penalty provided for
by the statute for refusal to enter satisfaction of a chattel
mortgage when it had been paid, could not be sustained against
the assignee of the mortgage without proof of the assignment
of record, as the purpose of the statute was to clear the record,
and, therefore, the defaulting party must have. record title or
his satisfaction would apparently be an impertinent interference
by a stranger. That action did not raise the question herein
presented, and the court made.no reference-to the case of Burhans. v. Hutcheson, supra.
is quite clear that it did not
intend to overrule that case. In any event, as already mentioned, the Burhans case has been approved in 57 Kansas, 744,

above cited. We cannot treat the rule which we have stated
above as having been at all shaken by the two cases from 28
and 29 Kansas, supra.
The counsel for plaintiff contends that, assuming there was
no statute providing for the recording of an assignment of a
chattel mortgage in the State of Kansas, yet there was no law
of that State which prohibited the Geneseo Bank from recording its assignment. It is not necessary that there should be
a law to prohibit the recording of such assignments. There
must be a law which provides for their record, either in express
terms or by plain and necessary implication from the words
stated. Where the statute does not so provide, it is not necessary nor is it the duty of the assignee to record or file his assignment. There must be some legal duty imposed upon the
assignee before the necessity arises for the recording of the
assignment.
Counsel have cited many cases from States other than Kansas, in which the rights of assignees of mortgagees as against
subsequent mortgages or conveyances have been discussed
and decided. In many cases the question has arisen in regard
to the recording of assignments of mortgages upon real estate,
where the States had provided for the recording of such assignments, and where, in the absense of such recording, the assignee
has failed in obtaining priority of rights under his mortgage,
which he would have had if the assignment had been recorded.
But as the owner of the cattle mentioned herein resided in
Kansas at the time the mortgages were given, and the cattle
were then in that State, and the mortgages were filed there,
the transactions are to be judged of with reference to the law
of that State, and we decide this question with reference to
such law.' Under that. law the assignee of the first mortgage
of June, 1900, has a supcrior lien to the assignee of the,second
mortgage of April, 1901, although such assignee of the first
mortgage did not have his assignment recorded.
Judgment is
Affirmed.
