PETITIONS FOR

WRITS

OF MANDAMUS

AND

OF PROHIBITION.

Submitted May 14, 1906.-Decided December 10, 1906.

Nos. 9, 10. Original.

The Supreme Court of the United Siates alone possesses jurisdiction derived immediately from the Constitution and of which the legislative
power cannot deprive it; that of the Circuit Court depends on some act
of Congress.
No suit which could not have been originally brought in the Circuit Court
of the United States can be removed therein from the state court.
Under §§ 1, 2, 3, of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, as amended by
the act of March 1, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, corrected by the act of August 13,
1888, 25 Stat. 433, an action commenced in a state court, by a citizen
of another State, against a non-resident defendant who is a citizen of a
State other than that of the plaintiff cannot be removed by the defendant
into the Circuit Court of the United States.
Where the Circuit Court refuses to remand to the state court a case removed to it, but over which it has no jurisdiction, mandamus from this
court is the proper remedy and not prohibition.

C. WISNER, a citizen of the State of Michigan, commenced an action at law, on February 17, A. D. 1906, in the
Circuit Court in and for the city of St. Louis and State of
Missouri, against John D. Beardsley, a citizen of the State of
Louisiana, by filing a petition, together with an affidavit, on
which that court issued a writ of attachment, in the usual
form, directed to the sheriff of St. Louis. The sheriff returned
no property found, but that he had garnisheed the Mississippi
Valley Trust Company, a corporation of Missouri, and also had
served Beardsley with summons in the city- of St. Louis.
Saturday, March 17, A. D. 1906, the garnishee answered, and
on the same day Beardsley filed his petition to remove the action from the state court into the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of
Missouri, on the ground of diversity of citizenship, together

with the bond required in such case. An order of removal
was thereupon entered by the state court and the transcript
of record was filed in the Circuit Court of the United States.
Monday, March 19, Wisner noved to remand in these words:
"Now at this day comes plaintiff, by his attorneys, Jones,
Jones & Hocker, and appearing specially for the purposes of
this motion only, saving and reserving any and all objections
which he has to the manifold imperfections in the mode, manner and method of the removal papers and expressly denying
that this court has jurisdiction of this cause, or of the plaintiff
therein, respectfully moves the court to remand this cause to
the Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis, from whence it was
removed, for the reason that this suit does not involve a controversy or dispute properly within the jurisdiction of this
court, and that it appears upon the face of the record herein
that the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the State of Michigan and the defendant a citizen and resident of the State of
Louisiana, and the cause is not one within the original jurisdiction of this court, hence this court cannot acquire jurisdiction by removal. '
The motion was heard and denied April 2, 1906, the Circuit
Court referring to Foulk v. Gray, 120 Fed. Rep. 156, and Rome
Petroleum Company v. Hughes, 130 Fed. Rep. 585, as representing the different views of the courts below on the question
involved.
On April 23, Wisner applied to this court for leave to file
a petition for mandamus as well as a petition for prohibition,
leave was granted, and rules entered returnable May 14, 1906,
and the cases submitted on the returns to the rules.
Mr. H. S. Mecartney, Mr. James C. Jones, Mr. J. J. Darlington and Mr. C. G. B. Drummond for petitioner:
The Circuit Court to which the case was removed had no
jurisdiction under the act of 1887-1888, as it does not appear
that either of the parties to the suit is a citizen of the State
and an inhabitant and resident of the district in which the

Circuit Court in which it is brought is held. Neither of the
parties to the suit involved in this application resided in the
Eastern Judicial District of Missouri, so that it could not have
been maintained in that court if it had been brought there
originally by original process. 25 Stat. 433; Shaw v. Quincy

43; Smith v. Lyon, 133 U. S. 319; St. Louis Ry. v. McBride,
141 U. S. 128.
In order to make a suit removable under § 2 of the act of
1887-1888 it must be one which the plaintiff could have
brought originally in the United States Circuit Court, to which
it would be removed by original process. Traction Co. v.
Mining Co., 196 U. S. 245; Mexican Nat. R. R. v. Davidson,

C. & 0. Ry., 169 U. S. 99; A1. C. & L. M. Ry. v. Swan, 111
U. S. 379.
The act of 1887 restored the rule of 1789, and as has been
heretofore decided, those suits only can be removed of which
the Circuit Courts are given original jurisdiction. Cochranv.
Montgomery County, 199 U. S. 260, which repudiates Rome v.
Hughes, 130 Fed. Rep. 585.
Plaintiff, not having submitted himself to the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court to which the case has been removed,
either by bringing his suit therein or by afterwards, by any
act of his, waiving the want of jurisdiction of the court in any
way, is at full liberty to object to the total want of jurisdiction
of the United States Circuit Court of the cause after its removal and to insist on the same.
The proceeding of removal is an original but indirect proceeding by which the United States Circuit Courts acquire

original jurisdiction of a cause.

203 U, S.

As to what "original" means

see Com. v. Schollinberger, 156 Pa. St. 213; Haley v. State,
42 Nebraska, 561; Anderson's Law Dict: 739; Black's Law
Dict. 857; Rich v. Husson, 1 Duer, 620.
The removal is only an indirect mode by which the Federal
court acquires original jurisdiction. 'Virginia v. Rives, 100
U. S. 337; Railway Co. v. Whitton, 13 Wall. 287.
Clause 2 of § 2 gives the right only to remove into a court
of the proper district and the only districts in.which a defendant can be sued under the act of 1888, is that of the residence
of the plaintiff, and that of the residence of the defendant.
Smith v. Lyon, 133 U. S. 319; McCormick v. IValthers, 134
U. S. 44; Mex. Nat. Bank v. Davidson, 157 U. S. 208; Shaw
v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U. S. 448, and such district is,
therefore, the only proper district, within the meaning of the
first section of the act.
Plaintiff did not sue originally in the Federal court, and
thus call on defendant either to object to the jurisdiction or
to waive the privilege he has of not being sued in that court
and submitting to its jurisdiction. For this reason it does not
fall within the principle of the cases which apply when the
question of waiver is raised by suit being brought originally
in the Federal court. Central Trust Co. v. McGeorge, 151
U. S. 134; Shaw v. Mining Co., 145 U. S. 453.
Although the suit was not removable under § 2, and, therefore, the Circuit Court acquired no jurisdiction of it through
the removal, yet, as this want of jurisdiction arose, not from
something absolutely essential to vest jurisdiction, but from
something in the nature of a personal privilege of the party
against whom jurisdiction is being asserted, it can be waived,
and if waived, the jurisdiction of the court would become
complete and attach independent of the removal, but solely
because the waiver brought the cause within the jurisdiction
of the court.
Such waiver may be effected by either a general appeqrance, or any imparlance, answer, plea, or other act whatso-

Petitioner has no other remedy and cannot preserve his
rights as by an appearance he would waive -them and therefore he is entitled to prohibition as of right.
The action of the Circuit Court complained of is in direct
violation of its duty as prescribed by the act in such a case,
is in violation of the statute and of the authority of thie United
States by which it was created and from which it receives its
authority. Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S.

Co., 34 Fed. Rep. 229.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after making the foregoing
statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

By Article III of the Constitution the judicial power of the
United States was "vested in one Supreme Court, and in such
inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain
and establish."
And the judicial power was extended "to all cases, in law
and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the
United States, and treaties made, or :which shall be made,
under their authority; to all case affecting ambassadors, other
public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction; tocontrovyrsies to which the United
States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more
States; between a State-and citizens of. another State; between
citizens of different States, betWeen citizens of the same State
claiming lands under grants of different States, and between
a State -or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens or

s+ubjects"

'The Supreme Court Alone" peesss jurisdiction, derived
immediately from the Constitution, and of which the legislativ,
power cannot* deprive it, United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch,
32; but the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts depends upon
some act of Congress. Turner v.Bank, 4 Dall. 8, 10; McIntire
v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 504, 506; Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 448;
Stevenson v. Fain, 195 U. S.165, 167. In the latter case we
said: "The use of the word 'controversies' as in contradistinction to the word 'cases,' and the omission of the word 'all' in
respect of controversies, left it to Congress' to define the controversies over which the courts it was empowered to otdain
and establish. might exercise jurisdiction, and the manner in
which it was to be done."

c. 366, p. 433, amended sections 1, 2 and 3 of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. c. 137, p. 470, as follows:
"That the Circuit Courts of the United States shall have
original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several
States, of all suits of a civil. nature, at common law or in equity,
where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and
costs, the sum or value of, two thousand dollars, and arising
under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties
made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or in
which controversy the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or in which there shall be a controversy between
citizens of different States, in which the matter in dispute
exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value
aforesaid;

. But no person shall be arrested in one

district for trial in another in any civil action before a Circuit
or District Court; and no civil suit shall be brought before
either of said courts against any person by any original process
or. proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an
inhabitant;- but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the
fact that the action is between citizens of different States,
suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of
either the plaintiff or the defendant;
"
" sEc. 2. That any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity

arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States,
or treaties made, or which shall. be made, under their authority, of which .the Circuit Courts of the United States are
given original jurisdiction by the preceding section, which
may 'now be pending, or which may hereafter be brought,
in any state court, may be removed by the defendant or defendants therein to the Circuit Court of the United States
for the proper district. -Any other suit of a civil nature, at
law or in equity, of which the Circuit CotIrts of. the United
States are given jurisdiction by the preceding section, and
which are now pending, or which may hereafter be brought,
in any state court, may be removed into- the Circuit Court
of the United States for the proper district by the defendant

or defendants therein being non-residents of that State; and
when in any suit mentioned in this section there shall be a
controversy which is wholly between citizens of different
States, and which can be fully determined as between them,
then either one or more of the defendants actually interested
in such controversy may remove said suit into the Circuit
Court of the United States for the proper district. And where
a suit is now pending, or may be hereafter brought, in any
state court, in which there is a controversy between a citizen
of the State in which the suit is brought and a citizen of another State, any defendant, being such citizen of another
State, may remove such suit into the Circuit Court of the
United States for the proper district, at any time before the
trial thereof, when it shall be made to appear to said Circuit
Court that from prejudice or local influence he will not be able
to obtain justice in such state court,
"Whenever any cause shall be removed from any state
court into any Circuit Court of, the United States, and the
Circuit Court shall decide that the cause was improperly
removed, and order the same to be remanded to the state
court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately
carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of error from the
decision of the Circuit Court so remanding such cause shall
be allowed."
Section 3, as amended, provided for petition and bond for
"the removal of such suit into the Circuit Court to be held
in the district where such suit is pending,

."

-

As it is the non-resident defendant alone, who is authorized
to remove, the Circuit Court for the proper district is evidently the Circuit Court of tl~e district of the residence of the
plaintiff.
And it is settled that no suit is removable under section 2
unless it be one'that plaintiff could have brought. originally
in the Circuit Court. Tennessee v. Bank, 152 U.: S. 454;

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

In Shaw v. Quincy Mining Company, 145 U. S. 444, 446,
Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, in disposing of the
question whether, under § 1, "a corporation incorporated in
one State of the Union, and having a usual place of business
in another State in which it has not been incorporated, may
be sued in a Circuit Court of the United States held in the
latter State, by a citizen of a different State," said:
"This question, upon which there has been a diversity of
opinion in the Circuit Courts, can be best 'determined by a.
review of the acts of Congress, and of the decisions of this
court, regarding the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts
of the United States over suits between citizens of different
States.
"In carrying out the provision of the Constitution which
declares-that the judicial power of the United States shall
extend to controversies 'between citizens of different States,'
Congress, by the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20,
§ 11, conferred jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of suits of a
civil nature, at common law or in equity, 'between a citizen
of the State where the suit is brought and a citizen of another
State,' and provided that ',no civil suit shall be brought against
an inhabitant of the United States, in any other district than
that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found
at the-time of serving the writ.' 1 Stat. 78, 79."
And, after observations in relation to the use of the word
"inhabitant" in that act, and referring to the act of May 4,
1858, 11 Stat. c. 27, p. 272, § 1, and the act of March 3, 1875,
18 Stat. 470, c. 137, § 1, Mr. Justice Gray thus continued:
"The act of 1887, both in its original form, and as corrected
in 1888, reenacts the rule- that no civil suit shall be brought
against any person in any other district than that whereof
he is an inhabitant, but omits the clause allowing a defendant
.to be sued in the district where he is found, and adds this
clause: 'But where the jurisdiction of either is founded only on
the fact that the action is between citizens of different States,
suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of

Ex parte WISNER.
203 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

either the plaintiff or the defendant.' 24 Stat. 552; 25 Stat.
434. As has been adjudged by this court, the last clause is
by way of proviso to the next preceding clause, which forbids
any suit to be brought in any other district than that whereof
the defendant is an inhabitant; and the effect is that "where
the jurisdiction is founded upon any of the clauses mentioned
in this section, except the citizenship of the parties, it must
be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded solely upon
the fact that the parties are citizens of different States, the
suit may be brought in the district in which either the plaintiff
or the defendant resides. McCormick Company v. Walthers,
134 U. S.41, 43. And the general object of this. act, as appears upon its face, and as has been often declared by this
court, is to contract, not to enlarge, the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Courts of the United States. Smith v. Lyon, 133 U. S.
315, 320; In re Pennsylvania Company, 137 U. S. 451, 454;
Fisk v. Henarie, 142 U. S.459, 467.
"As to natural persons, therefore, it cannot be doubted that
the effect of this act, read in the light of earlier acts upon the
same subject, and of the judicial c6nstruction thereof, is that
the phrase 'district of the residence of' a person is equivalent
to 'district whereof he is an inhabitant,' and cannot be construed as giving jurisdiction, by reason of citizenship, to a
Circuit Court held in a State of which neither party is a citizen,
but, on the contrary, rustricts the jurisdiction to the district
in which one of the parties resides within the State of which
he is a citizen; and that this act, therefore, having taken away
the alternative, permitted in the earlier acts, of suing a person
in the district 'in which he shall be found,' requires any suit,
the jurisdiction of which is founded only on its being between
citizens of different States, to be brought in the State of which
one is a citizen, and in the district tnerein of which he is -an
inhabitant and resident."
In short, the acts of 1887-1888 restored the rule of 1789,
as we stated in Cochran v. Montgottiery County, supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.
Opinion of the Court.

203 U. S.

In the present case neither of the parties was a citizen of
the State of Missouri, in which State the suit was brought,
and, therefore, it could not have been brought in the Circuit
Court in the first instance.
Wisner did not, of choice, select the state court as the forum,
since he could not have sued in the Circuit Court under the
act, because neither he nor Beardsley was a citizen of Missouri.
And the question of jurisdiction relates to the time of commencing the suit.
But it is contended that Beardsley was entitled to remove
the case to the Circuit Court, and as by his petition for removal he waived the objection so far as he was personally
concerned that he was not sued in his district, hence that the
Circuit Court obtained jurisdiction over the suit. This does
not follow, inasmuch as in view of the intention of Congress
by the act of 1887 to contract the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Courts, and of the limitations imposed thereby, jurisdiction
of the suit could not have obtained, even with the consent of
both parties. As we have heretofore remarked: "Jurisdiction
as to the subject matter may be limited in various ways as to
civil and criminal cases; cases at common law or in equity or
in admiralty; probate cases, or. cases under special statutes;
to particular classes of persons; to proceedings in particular
modes; and so on." Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, 184
U. S. 18, 25. In Central Trust Company v. McGeorge, 151
U. S. -129, it was assumed, however, that the requirement
that no suit should be brought in any other district than that
of the plaintiff or of the defendant might be waived, where
neither resided therein, because in that case the non-resident
plaintiff had sued in the Circuit Court and the non-resident
defendant had answered on the merits, which showed the
consent of both parties and riot unnaturally led to the result
announced, while in this case there was no such consent. As
was stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, in Kinney v. Columbia
Savings & Loan Association, 191 U. S. 78, 82: "A petition
and bond for removal are in the nature of process. They

TAYLOR v. TAFT.
203 U. S.

Syllabus.

constitute the process by which the case is transferred from
the state to the Federal court." When, then, Beardsley filed
his petition for removal, he sought affirmative relief in another
district than his own. But plaintiff, in resisting the application and moving to remand, denied the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court. In St. Louis &c. Railway Co. v. McBride, 141
U. S. 127, where the plaintiffs were citizens and residents of
the Western District of Arkansas, and commenced their -.ctio.
in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district, and
the defendant was a corporation and citizen of the State of
Missouri, it was held that, as the defendant appeared and
pleaded to the merits, he thereby waived his right to challenge
thereafter the jurisdiction of the court over him, on the ground
that the suit had been brought in the wrong district. And
there are many other cases to the same effect.
Our conclusion is that the case should have been remanded,
and as the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to proceed, that
mandamus is the proper remedy.
Mandamus awarded; petition for prohibition dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER concurred in the result.

or his representative to dismiss him, but only contends that his dis missal
is illegal because certain rules ani regulations of the civil service were
not observed, the validity of an authority exercised under the United
States is not drawn in question, and under § 233 of the Code of the District of Columbia, 31 Stat. 1189, 1127, this court has no jurisdiction to
review the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Writ of error to review 24 App. D. C. 95, dismissed.
