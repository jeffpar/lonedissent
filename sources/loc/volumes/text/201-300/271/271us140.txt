EARLY & DANIEL COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 299.

Argued April 30, 1926.-Decided May 3, 1926.

When a contractor, upon demand of the Government, delivers under
protest goods in an amount exceeding that which his contract calls
for at the time, and, the protest being ignored, thereafter accepts
without protest the contract price, there is no ground for implying
a contract upon the Government's part to pay the market price,
though higher. P. 142.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a suit against the United States for $22,000,
balance due for hay delivered. Appellant made a contract with the Government, on the 31st day of July, 1917,
by which it agreed to furnish, during the period beginning
August 1, 1917, and ending September 30, 1917, such hay
as might be required by the Government during July and
the first half of August, 1917, not to exceed 6,000,000
cents per 100 pounds, and such hay as
pounds, at 97
might be required during the last half of August, and all
of September, 1917, not exceeding 6,000,000 pounds, at
95 cents per 100 pounds, to be delivered f. o. b. cars at
Newport News, Virginia, subject to call of the Government in lots not to exceed 1,000,000 pounds per lot. The

Opinion of the Court.

Government made calls which the plaintiff filled as
follows:
Call No. 1, 500,000 lbs. August 15.1917.
Call No. 2, 1,050,000 lbs. August 20,1917.
Call No. 3, 2,000,000 lbs. September 5, 1917.
Call No. 4, 4,450,000 lbs. September 12, 1917.
These calls were all filled without protest, though the
later calls were for amounts greater than 1,000,000 lbs.
When the final and fifth call was made for 4,000,000
pounds, the appellant objected that the call was for more
pounds of hay than the contract allowed for any one
call. That objection was not made until it was too late
for the defendant to amend the call. The appellant's
vice-president then wrote to the government officer in
charge that the fifth call was not deemed by the plaintiff
to be in accord with the contract, and that the plaintiff
did not intend to fill it. Under the terms of the contract,
appellant had until November 15th, being three months
from the date of the first call, to complete its deliveries.
On November 19th, the Camp Quartermaster wired to the
appellant, "Amount hay on hand will supply needs to December 4th. Require prompt delivery 4,000,000 pounds.
Advise at once your action, otherwise must buy in open
market." After further exchange of telegrams, plaintiff
sent the following telegram to the Camp Quartermaster
under date of November 21, 1917:
"We will start shipping hay immediately, and in case
you need any before arrival will arrange to have Hiden
loan us a supply. Want it distinctly understood that we
are doing this under protest and are going to put the
matter up to proper authorities in Washington; and if
they rule in our favor, want settlement at fair market
price for amount we overfill. Will you wire C. S. Ruttle,
General Agent, D. B. C. & W. Railway, to furnish equipment immediately as we request for hay to ship to you?
Answer."

Syllabus.

271 U. S.

The plaintiff delivered under protest the remaining
4,000,000 pounds of hay. Thereafter the plaintiff accepted without protest the sum of $38,000, which was all
that was due under the contract. The plaintiff then filed
this claim for $22,000 with the acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army, with the Auditor for the
War Department, with the Secretary of War, with the
Comptroller of the Treasury, and with the Board of Contract Adjustment, all of whom in turn decided that the
claim could not be paid.
The appellant had the option of delivering the remainder of the hay under the terms of the contract, or of not
delivering it at all, if the contract had been broken. It
chose to deliver. It made a protest, but that was ignored
by the officers of the Government, and, when the Government tendered the contract price, it was accepted by
the appellant and without protest. Under such circumstances there is no ground for implying a contract to pay
more than the contract price. New York & New Haven
