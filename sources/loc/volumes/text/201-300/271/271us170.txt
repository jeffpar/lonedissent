OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

271 U. S.

Losses incurred in its operation would not be reflected in
the accounts of any interstate carrier; and no interstate
carrier would have had to make good deficits so incurred.
Its continued operation could not burden or prejudice interstate commerce, for the Commission in issuing its certificate had adjudged that public necessity and convenience did not demand the continuance of its interstate
services.
Affirmed.
BOWERS, COLLECTOR, v. KERBAUGH-EMPIRE
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 173.

Argued January 25, 1926.-Decided May 3, 1926.

Plaintiff borrowed money from a bank in Germany before the War,
repayable in marks or their equivalent in gold coin of the United
States, lost the borrowed money in business, and repaid the loan
to the Alien Property Custodian in 1921, when marks had greatly
depreciated, the amount of the depreciation, however, being less
than the losses sustained on the entire transaction. Held that the
difference, resulting from the depreciation, between the amount
borrowed and the amount repaid, in American money, was not
taxable as "income." P. 173.
300 Fed. 938, affirmed.

is taxable income to it for the year in which the debt was
paid. Stratton'sIndependence v. Howbert, 231 U. S. 399;

U. S. 501.
The fact that defendant in error was not a dealer in
foreign exchange, or that the transaction was not entered
into by it with any idea of gain, is immaterial. This
Court has definitely decided that increase in capital assets resulting from isolated or casual transactions outside
a taxpayer's ordinary business operations is constitutionally taxable. Merchants L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, 255
U. S. 509; Eldorado Coal Co. v. Mager, 255 U. S. 522;

The reality of the transaction is that defendant in error
sold its promise to pay a certain number of marks for
$764,867.30, and later bought this promise back for $80,411.12. People ex rel. Keim v. Wendell, 193 N. Y. Supp.

through its New York representative, for loans to finance
the work being done by its subsidiary. The bank agreed
that it would make the loans by cabling to the credit of its
New York representative German marks equivalent in
dollars to the requirements of defendant in error, upon
condition that the loans would be evidenced by notes
payable as to principal and interest in marks or their
equivalent in United States gold coin at prime bankers'
rate in New York for cable transfers to Berlin. June 8,
1911, defendant in error advised the New York representative of the amount in dollars then needed; he notified his
principal and it put to his credit in a New York bank
marks equivalent to the amount of money of the United
States applied for. Then he drew his check payable in
dollars against the credit and gave it to defendant in
error, and in exchange received the promissory note of the
latter payable in marks or their equivalent in gold coin
of the United States. Prior to July 2, 1913, twenty-four
loans were made in this manner amounting in all to
$1,983,000. The equivalent in marks was 8,341,337.50.
September 1, 1913, there remained unpaid 6,740,800
marks. The notes of defendant in error then outstanding
were surrendered and its new note for that amount was
given. And when that note became due it was renewed.
Partial payments were made and, by March 31, 1915, the
principal was reduced to 3,216,445 marks.
The several amounts from time to time borrowed by
defendant in error were contemporaneously advanced to
its subsidiary and were expended and lost in and about the
performance of the construction contracts. These losses
were sustained in 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917 and 1918, and
were allowed as deductions in the subsidiary's income tax
returns for those years. The excess of its losses over
income was more than the amount here claimed by
plaintiff in error to be income of defendant in error in
1921.

173

Opinion of the Court.

After the United States entered the War the Deutsche
Bank was an alien enemy. In 1921, on the demand of
the Alien Property Custodian, defendant in error paid
him $113,688.23 in full settlement of principal and interest owing on the note belonging to the bank. Of that
amount $80,411.12 represented principal. The settlement
was on the basis of two and one-half cents per mark.
Measured by United States gold coin the difference between the value of the marks borrowed at the time the
loans were made and the amount paid to the Custodian
was $684,456.18. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, notwithstanding the claim of defendant in error that
the amount borrowed had been lost in construction operations carried on by it and its subsidiary and that no
income resulted from the transaction, held the amount to
be income and chargeable to defendant in error for 1921.
Excluding that item the tax return for 1921 shows a
deficit of $581,254.77.
The defendant in error by its complaint set forth the
facts above stated and asserted-as it still insists-that
the diminution in value of the marks was not income
within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment; that
the item in controversy is not within the Revenue Act,
and that, if construed to include it, the Act would be
unconstitutional. Plaintiff in error moved to dismiss on
the ground that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court denied
the motion and gave judgment for defendant in error.
This writ of error was taken under ยง 238, Judicial Code,
before the amendment of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43
Stat. 936, 938.
The question for decision is whether the difference between the value of marks measured by dollars at the time
of payment to the Custodian and the value when the loans
were made was income.
The Sixteenth Amendment declares that Congress shall
have power to levy and collect taxes on income, "from

whatever source derived" without apportionment among
the several States, and without regard to any census or
enumeration. It was not the purpose or effect of that
Amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing
power. Congress already had power to tax all incomes.
But taxes on incomes from some sources had been held
to be "direct taxes" within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment. Art. I, ยง 2, cl.
3, ยง 9, cl. 4; Pollock v. Farmers'Loan and Trust Co., 158
U. S. 601. The Amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that
are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes "from
whatever source derived." Brushaber v. Union Pac.
R. R., 240 U. S. 1, 17. "Income" has been taken to mean
the same thing as used inthe Corporation Excise Tax Act
of 1909, in the Sixteenth Amendment and in the various
revenue acts subsequently passed. Southern Pacific Co.
v. Lowe, 247 U. S.330, 335; Merchants L. & T. Co. v.
Smietanka, 255 U. S. 509, 519. After full consideration,
this Court declared that income may be defined as gain
derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,
including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, 231 U. S.399,
415; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S.179, 185;
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S.189, 207. And that definition has been adhered to and applied repeatedly. See
e. g. Merchants L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, supra, 518;
Goodrich v. Edwards, 255 U. S.527, 535; United States
v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 169; Miles v. Safe Deposit Co.,
259 U. S.247, 252-253; United States v. Supplee-Biddle
Co., 265 U. S. 189, 194; Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U. S. 161,
167; Edwards v. Cuba Railroad, 268 U. S.628, 633. In
determining what constitutes income substance rather
than form is to be given controlling weight. Eisner v.
Macomber, supra, 206.

BOWERS v. KERBAUGH-EMPIRE CO.

175

Opinion of the Court.

The transaction here in question did not result in gain
from capital and labor, or from either of them, or in profit
gained through the sale or conversion of capital. The
essential facts set forth in the complaint are the loans in
1911, 1912, and 1913, the loss in 1913 to 1918 of the
moneys borrowed, the excess of such losses over income
by more than the item here in controversy, and payment
in the equivalent of marks greatly depreciated in value.
The result of the whole transaction was a loss.
Plaintiff in error insists that in substance and effect the
transaction was a "short sale" of marks resulting in gain
to defendant in error. But there is no similarity between
what was done and such a venture. A short seller borrows what he sells, and the purchase price goes to the
lender and is retained as security for repayment. The
seller receives nothing until he repays the loan. Such a
transaction would not meet the requirements of defendant in error. It needed the money for use and received
the amount borrowed and expended it.
The contention that the item in question is cash gain
disregards the fact that the borrowed money was lost,
and that the excess of such loss over income was more
than the amount borrowed. When the loans were made
and notes given, the assets and liabilities of defendant in
error were increased alike. The loss of the money borrowed wiped out the increase of assets, but the liability
remained. The assets were further diminished by payment of the debt. The loss was less than it would have
been if marks had not declined in value; but the mere
diminution of loss is not gain, profit or income.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JusTicE BRANDEIs concurs in the result.
