CHICAGO & NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. ALVIN R. DURHAM COMPANY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 257.

Argued April 20, 1926.-Decided May 24, 1926.

1. The Uniform Bill of Lading Act of August 29, 1916, a. 415, § 23,
presents no obstacle to garnishment of a carrier after the order
bill of lading has been surrendered; neither does that Act confer a
right of garnishment. P. 256.
2. The fact that, by § 5 of the Uniform Bill of Lading, as construed
by this Court in Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mark Owen & Co.,
256 U. S. 427, a carrier may remain liable qua carrier to the consignee of an interstate carload shipment after surrender of the
bill of lading and payment of charges and while the car is on a
train track and turned over to the consignee for the purpose of
unloading, and partly unloaded by him, is not determinative of
the carrier's liability as garnishee in a suit by a stranger seeking
to collect a debt from the consignee. P. 255.
3. The carrier's liability to garnishment in such circumstances depends on the state law. P. 257.

Mr. R. N. Van Doren, with whom Mr. Samuel H. Cady
was on the brief, for petitioner.
Under Michigan law the right to hold a garnishee
liable depends upon the state of the claim, as one garnishable or not, at the time of the service of the process in
garnishment. As a condition precedent, the garnishee

must have in his hands or under its custody or control
property belonging to the defendant. This possession,
custody or control must exist at the time of the service
of the process in garnishment.
Prior to the decision in the Mark Owen Case, 256 U. S.
427, the courts uniformly held that facts similar to those
of this case constituted delivery. Whitney Mfg. Co. v.
Richmond & D. R. Co., 38 S. C. 365; Rothchild v. Northern Pac. R. R., 68 Wash. 527. See also Kenny Co. v.
Atlanta & W. P. R. Co., 122 Ga. 365; Arkadelphia Mill
Co. v. Smoker Mdse. Co., 100 Ark. 37; Vaughn v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. R., 27 R. I. 235; Paddock v. Toledo
& 0. C. R. Co., 21 Ohio C. C. 626; Anchor Mil Co. v.
Burlington, C. R. & N. R. Co., 102 Ia. 262; South & N. A.
R. Co. v. Wood, 66 Ala. 167; Southern R. Co. v. Barclay,
1 Ala. App. 348.
The bill of lading does not change the law as to the
facts which constitute delivery. It simply extends the
liability of the carrier as to the goods "not removed"
from the car. Delivery of the goods in the sense of the
surrender of possession, the surrender of the carriers' lien,
the surrender of custody or control, is not inconsistent
with such liability. The sole question considered by the
court in the Mark Owen Case was one arising out of the
contract relations of the parties and involving the liability of the carrier to the consignee upon and by reason
of such contract. The effect of the decision was to place
upon the carrier the duty of policing and protecting cars
in process of unloading, and for failure to do so a liability was created. In order to hold the carrier liable it
was not necessary to hold what the language of the
opinion, taken literally, seems to indicate. The purport
of the language will properly be restricted in its scope
to the query then under consideration, to-wit: the liability of the carrier before the removal of merchandise
from a car.

CHICAGO & N. W. RY. v. DURHAM CO.

253

Argument for Respondent.

Mr. Joseph L. Hooper, with whom Messrs. Julius J.
Patek, Myron, H. Walker, and Solomo W. Patek were
on the brief, for respondent Durham Company.
The bill of lading, and the rules and regulations subject to which it is issued and accepted, constitute the
contract between the parties, the carrier, the shipper, and
the consignee, and necessarily limit and govern their
rights in the shipment and the rights of those claiming
under them; and it is well settled that the liability of
the garnishee in respect of property in his hands is governed and must be determined by such contract and can
neither be enlarged, restricted, modified, nor impaired
as to the garnisheeing creditor and his rights. It is, therefore, the contention of the respondent that the rights of
the parties in this case, fixed as they are by the contract
of shipment, are settled; and this case is governed by the
recent decision of this Court in Michigan Central R. R.
Co. v. Mark Owen & Co., 256 U. S. 427.
The Railway Company had plenary control over the
car and the apples remaining in it, at the time the summons was served. As to such property "there was no
delivery," "but only a right of access given to it in order
that it might be removed." This "right of access" thus
"given" was a mere license revocable at any time by
the Railway Company, certainly for cause, such as service of process in garnishment. In the meantime the apples remained and were in the "custody and control" of
the Railway Company, and as carrier. The relative
rights and liabilities of the Railway Company as carrier,
and of the consignee, under the bill of lading, in the
goods still in the car during the forty-eight hour period,
do not depend upon the fact of the payment of the
freight bill, but upon the fact of "delivery" or "no
delivery," of the shipment still in the car, and the consequent "custody and control" by the carrier of the
shipment "not removed." See Erie R. R. Co. v. Shuart,
250 U. S. 465; Southern Ry. Co. v. Prescott,240 U. S. 632.

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

Congress in the Uniform Bill of Lading Act, August
29, 1916, 39 Stat. 542, § 23, recognized that the surrender
of the order bill of lading is not of itself a delivery of the
goods or of possession so as to preclude garnishment of
the carrier for the goods, for it expressly provides that
goods in the possession of the carrier, in case of an order
bill of lading, cannot be attached by garnishment of the
carrier, "unless the bill be first surrendered to the carrier," and, further, that "the carrier shall in no such
case be compelled to deliver the actual possession of the
goods until the bill is surrendered or impounded by the
Court."
MR. JusTIcE

BRANDEIs delivered the opinion of the

Court.
By an interstate shipment made under the uniform
order bill of lading the Chicago & Northwestern Railway
received in 1921 at its yards in Ironton, Michigan, a boxcar containing apples consigned to the shipper's order,
"Notify F. M. Larson." The car was placed on the
"team track," which is one of the public delivery tracks
used for unloading freight received in car-load shipments
and is not connected in any manner with a railway freight
warehouse. The next morning, at 8.20 o'clock, Larson
surrendered the bill of lading duly indorsed, paid the
freight charges, gave to the Railway his receipt for the
apples, and commenced unloading the car. On the same
day the Alvin R. Durham Company sued out a writ of
garnishment against the Railway which was served at
9.45 a. m. At that time about one-quarter of the apples
had already been taken from the car by Larson. In spite
of the service of the writ of garnishment, the Railway did
not prevent the further unloading. This was not completed until four days later. Meanwhile the car was
locked every night by Larson. During this period of un-

loading, the car was shifted several times by the Railway
for its own convenience in the use of the team tracks.
The trial court directed a verdict for the garnishee on
the ground that the Railway did not have the custody,
control or possession of the shipment. The Supreme
Court of Michigan reversed that judgment and held the
carrier liable on the ground that "under the interpretation of § 5 of the uniform bill of lading as appears in
Michigan Central R. Co. v. [Mark] Owen [& Co.], 256
U. S. 427, . . . the railway did have the custody, control
and possession of the interstate shipment." 229 Mich.
468. See also 224 Mich. 477; 265 U. S. 580. This Court
granted a writ of certiorari. 268 U. S. 684. The sole
question for decision is whether the Railway is liable as
garnishee.
The facts in the two cases are similar, but the legal
questions presented for decision are wholly different. In
the Mark Owen Case it was sought to enforce under the
federal law an alleged liability in contract of an interstate carrier to the consignee. Whether the railroad was
liable depended upon the construction to be given the
contract for an interstate shipment contained in the uniform bill of lading. Compare Southern Railway Co. v.
Prescott,240 U. S. 632. The question was whether, in the
absence of negligence, the railroad was liable to the consignee for grapes stolen from the car while on the team
track after the unloading had begun, but before the expiration of 48 hours after giving notice of arrival.' The
'Section 1 of the uniform bill of lading provides: "The carrier or
party in possession of any of the property herein described shall be
liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter
provided. . .. "
Section 5: "Property not removed by tihe party entitled to receive
it within forty-eight hours . . . after notice of its arrival has been
duly sent or given may be kept in car, depot, or place of delivery of
the carrier, or warehouse subject to a reasonable charge for storage
and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only ..

OCTOBER TERM, 1925.
Opinion of the Court.

271 U. S.

railroad contended that, under § 5 of the bill of lading,
there was no liability, because the surrender of the car to
the consignee, followed by breaking the seals and commencement of unloading, constituted a delivery; and that,
in any event, its responsibility for the unloaded part of
the contents had become that of warehouseman. This
Court held that, since the theft occurred within the 48hour period, there had not been, under the contract of the
parties as expressed in § 5 of the bill of lading, such a delivery as would terminate the carrier's liability as insurer
or reduce the liability to that of the warehouseman's
exercise of reasonable care.
In the case at bar it is sought to hold the railroad liable
as garnishee to a stranger. It is not sought to enforce a
liability arising under a federal law. As the order bill of
lading had been surrendered, the Uniform Bill of Lading
Act presented no obstacle to garnishment. Act of August
29, 1916, c. 415, § 23, 39 Stat. 538, 542. But that Act
obviously confers no right to garnishment. Nor is there
anything in the bill of lading which conceivably could be
construed as either conferring or denying the right of
garnishment. The plaintiff does not seek to enforce, as
a derivative right, a claim of the consignee against the
carrier under the bill of lading. It seeks to reach tangible property confessedly belonging to the principal defendant and to which the carrier confessedly makes no
claim either of title or possession. Section 5 of the bill of
lading clearly does not authorize a carrier, who had surrendered to the consignee control of the shipment upon
surrender of the bill of lading, payment of charges and
signing of the usual receipt, any right to recapture control of the unloaded part of the shipment in the event
that garnishee proceedings are commenced within 48 hours
after such surrender.
The liabilities consequent upon the character of the
custody and control exercised by carrier or consignee arise

from and are dependent upon the state statutes conferring the right of garnishment, and as such are unaffected
by the provisions of the bill of lading. Thus the question
whether, under the circumstances, the apples remaining
in the car were subject to garnishment, is not one of uniform carrier liability, but, primarily, of procedure, and
as such governed by varying views of local policy, legislation and practice. Thus, a garnishee may be under no
liability, because the property could have been reached
by direct levy.2 He may be under no liability because
of the nature of the claim sought to be enforced,3 or
because of the character of the plaintiff,' of the principal
defendant,5 of the garnishee,6 or of the property sought

to be reached.' And, although no objection may exist
upon any of these grounds, the garnishee may be held
immune from liability, becahse the highest court of the
State had declared that to allow garnishment, under the
circumstances, would be against public policy; as where
a carrier having possession, custody and control of property is held not chargeable by garnishment because the
goods were in process of transportation
Whether under the law of Michigan the Railway was
liable as garnishee, we have no occasion to enquire.
There is nothing in the uniform bill of lading which would
prevent the state court from holding that, although the
freight car was in the carrier's possession, it was not liable
as garnishee of the contents, because the apples were in
the consignee's possession although not unloaded. A
person breaking open and taing the contents of a chest
in his custody has been held guilty of larceny. Union
Trust Co. v. Wilson, 198 U. S. 530, 537. The state court,
however, reversed the judgment of the trial court because
it assumed that the liability of the garnishee was fixed
by the federal law, and that, under the rule declared in
the Mark Owen Case, the railroad was liable. As this
was error, the judgment must be reversed and the cause
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion. Ebert v. Poston, 266 U. S. 548. Compare
