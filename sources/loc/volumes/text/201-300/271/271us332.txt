Delmar Jockey Club v. Missouri, supra, 335. Mere error
of a court, if any there be, in a judgment entered after a

full hearing, does not constitute a denial of due process

It results that, in the absence of any substantial constitutional or statutory question giving us jurisdiction of
this appeal under the provisions of § 250 of the Judicial
Code, we cannot determine upon the merits the contentions earnestly pressed by the defendants in this court
that the indenture is not only void because contrary to
public policy, but is also of such a discriminatory character that a court of equity will not lend its aid by enforcing the specific performance of the covenant. These
are questions involving a consideration of rules not expressed in any constitutional or statutory provision, but
claimed to be a part of the common or general law in
force in the District of Columbia; and, plainly, they may
not be reviewed under this appeal unless jurisdiction of
the case is otherwise acquired.
Hence, without a consideration of these questions, the
appeal must be, and is
Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

Court which dismissed an action brought by the United

RESPONSE

Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, with whom
Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. John J. Byrne were
on the brief, for the United States.
The bond sued upon, as evidenced by its plain recitals,
as well as by the statute which authorized it, the regulations under which it was prescribed, and the administrative construction of its purpose and effect, is a bond
required by the Government of the principal named
therein, not to secure the United States against any supposed pecuniary damage it might sustain from a breach,
but to insure the observance by the principal of the law
and regulations in pursuance of which the bond was
given. National Prohibition Act, § 6, Tit. II; Treasury
Decision 2940, Art. 15(b), (f); Regulations 60 (ed. Feb.
1, 1920), § 20(a), (c); Treasury Decision 2559, p. 12;
Treasury Decision 2788, p. 23; 32 Op. At. Gen. 365.
Upon a breach of the condition of such a bond the full
penal sum is recoverable as a penalty or forfeiture
against which neither a court of equity nor a court of law
will relieve, first, because it is imposed by law, and second,

If the breach is of a covenant within the authority of
the statute, the bond will be held to be a valid statutory
bond to that extent and the excess rejected as surplusage.
If the covenant breached is not within the statutory authority, the bond, having been entered into by competent
parties and not being prohibited by law or opposed to
public policy, will be held to be a valid and binding obligation at common law. Moreover, the obligor, having
enjoyed the benefits for which the bond was given, is
estopped to deny its validity. Speake v. United States,

Form 738 is not a forfeiture bond. The condition in
the bond must be construed by a consideration of its
terms and of all the circumstances attending its execution. Sun PrintingAssn. v. Moore, 183 U. S. 642; Clark
v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436; United States v. Montell, 26

States v. U. S. F. & G. Co., 1 Fed. (2d) 335. The language of the condition is not that of a forfeiture bond.
The purpose of the Commissioner and Treasury Department was to obtain indemnity only. The purpose
of Congress in requiring a bond from permittees was indemnity only.
Revised Statutes, § 961, prevents the recovery of the
full amount under this bond. Sun Printing Assn. v.
Moore, 183 U. S. 642; United States v. Dieckerhoff, 202

States v. Abeel, 174 Fed. 12; In re Appel, 163 Fed. 1002.
If form 738 is held to be a forfeiture bond on its face,
it represents an excess of power on the part of the Commissioner which prevents its enforcement. Field v. Clark,

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case comes before us on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals. Jud. Code, § 239.
It appears from the certificate that Zerbey, on January
23, 1920, applied to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under the provisions of the National Prohibition
Act,' for a permit to sell distilled spirits and wines for
other than beverage purposes, and filed with his application a bond in the sum of $100,000, with the National
Surety Company as surety. This bond was on Form 738,
previously prescribed by the regulations, and recited, in
accordance therewith, that "the condition of this obligation is such that if the said principal shall fully and
faithfully comply with all the requirements of the laws
of the United States now or hereafter enacted and regulations issued pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use
of distilled spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, then this obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full force and virtue." On January 26, the Commissioner issued to Zerbey a permit "under the conditions that the provisions of the national prohibition act,
and regulations issued thereunder will be strictly observed."
Thereafter, the United States brought an action against
Zerbey and the Surety Company in a Federal District
Court, in which it was alleged that Zerbey had violated
the condition of the bond in (a) failing and neglecting to
keep records of his sales of distilled spirits, as required
by the Prohibition Act and regulations, (b) selling and
141 Stat. 305, C.85.

UNITED STATES v. ZERBEY.

Opinion of the Court.

disposing of distilled spirits for beverage purposes, (c)
diverting distilled spirits to other than beverage purposes, and (d) having in his possession whiskey which
had been withdrawn, for nonbeverage purposes only, from
a bonded warehouse, of which he kept no record as required by the Prohibition Act and regulations; and that
the full penal sum of the bond had been forfeited and
was due by the defendants to the United States by reason of these breaches of the condition of the bond. It
was not alleged that any damage or loss had been sustained by the United States as the result of these breaches.
The defendants filed statutory demurrers, which were sustained by the District Court on the ground that the
United States could not recover the full penal sum of the
bond, but only such loss or damage as it had sustained
in consequence of the breaches of the bond; and the
suit was dismissed. And the case having been taken to
the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error, it has certified that, for the proper decision of the case, it desires
the instruction of this Court as to the following questions of law: "(1) Is a bond conditioned upon compliance
with the law of the United States and regulations issued
pursuant thereto, respecting the sale or use of distilled
spirits and wines for other than beverage purposes, given
the United States by one to whom a permit to sell intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes has been
issued under the provisions of § 6 of Title II of the national prohibition act and regulations promulgated thereunder, forfeitable upon breach of the condition in the full
amount of its penal sum? (2) Is recovery upon breach of
the condition of such a bond given by one holding such a
permit limited to actual damages sustained by the United
States?"
These questions, shortly stated, are, in effect: Whether
a permit bond on Form 738 is a forfeiture bond entitling
the United States to recover the full amount named on a
9542--26-22

271 U. S.

breach of its condition, or a bond of indemnity for the
actual damages sustained by the United States from
such breach.
Section 6, Title II, of the National Prohibition Act
provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that:
"No one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or
prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from
the commissioner so to do, . . . The commissioner
may prescribe the form of all permits and applications
and the facts to be set forth therein. Before any permit
is granted the commissioner may require a bond in such
form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and the provisions of
this title."
By § 29 it is further provided that any person violating the provisions of any permit or of this title, shall be
punished by either fine or imprisonment, or both; and, by
§ 35, that a tax shall be assessed against any person
responsible for an illegal sale in double the amount provided by the internal revenue law, with an additional
penalty.
By regulations issued by the Commissioner in October
and November, 1919,2 every applicant for a permit for
the sale or use of distilled spirits or wines for other than
beverage purposes, was required to furnish either a bond
with corporate or personal sureties, on Form 738, in a
penal sum of from $1,000 to $100,000, computed, at
specified rates, on the quantity of spirits and wine which
he then had on hand or would receive in the next quarterly period; or his personal bond for the same amount,
secured by the deposit of Government bonds as collateral
security.
Form 738 prescribed for a surety bond-which was
used by Zerbey-was conditioned, as previously stated,
that the principal "shall fully and faithfully comply with
2T. D. 2940; T. D. 2946.

UNITED STATES v. ZERBEY.
332

Opinion of the Court.

all the requirements of the laws of the United States now
or hereafter enacted, and regulations issued pursuant
thereto respecting the sale or use of distilled spirits and
wines for other than beverage purposes." The corresponding Form 738A prescribed for a collateral bond,
recited the pledge of Government bonds "as security for
any obligation arising hereunder," and contained, after
the general condition in Form 738, a specific provision
that "the said principal expressly agrees that the said
bonds so deposited may be sold . . . -and the proceeds applied to the payment of any internal-revenue
taxes, interest, and penalties which may be due, and in
satisfaction of any liabilities incurred hereunder, and the
expenses of such sale, if any; and the residue, if any, paid
to the said principal."
Thereafter, by Regulations No. 60,1 which, although
dated January 16, 1920, were not, it appears, published
and put into effect until February 1-after the issuance
of the permit to Zerbey-an applicant for a permit to
sell or use distilled spirits or wines was required to file
either a surety bond on a new Form 1408 or a collateral
bond on a new Form 1409; provided that if the holder
of such a permit had already given a bond on Form 738
or Form 738A in a sufficient penal sum, a new bond
should not be required until he was called upon to make
an application for a new permit.
The Form 1408 thus prescribed for a surety bond,4 recites that "the condition of this obligation is such that if
. . . the said principal shall not violate the terms of
such permit

other intoxicating liquors, and will pay all taxes, assessments, fines, and penalties incurred or imposed upon him
by law, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect." And Form 1409 prescribed for a collateral bond likewise provides that upon
the sale of the Government's bonds pledged as security,
the proceeds, shall "be applied to the payment of any
internal-revenue taxes, interest, fines and penalties which
may be due, and in satisfaction of any liabilities incurred
hereunder and the expenses of such sale, if any; and the
residue, if any, paid to said principal."
The case now presented is not that of a bond executed
to the Government in a specified penal sum prescribed by
statute and intended as a fixed penalty imposed for a
breach of a statutory duty, which is forfeited in its full
amount by a breach of the condition irrespective of the
actual damage thereby caused the Government. Clark v.
Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 461; United States v. Dieckerhoff, 202 U. S. 302, 309; United States v. Montell (Taney,
47), 26 Fed. Cas. 1293, 1296. Whether Congress did or
could authorize the Commissioner in fixing the form of
bond to prescribe a penalty, we need not consider; for
here it is plain that he did not intend that the penal
sum of a surety bond on Form 738 should be a penalty
or liquidated damages--in this case of $100,000-the full
amount of which the United States might recover for any
breach of condition, however slight, as, for example, a
failure to make a record of any sale as required by the
regulations; but, on the contrary, intended that such
penal sum should be the maximum amount of the obligation incurred by reason of a breach of the bond. Form
738 is unquestionably to be read in connection with Form
738A. These were prescribed by the same regulations as
alternative forms of the bond which the applicant might
at his election furnish. They had precisely the same object, and were intended to secure the same obligation;

UNITED STATES v. ZERBEY.
332

Opinion of the Court.

the one by personal sureties, the other by the deposit of
collateral. Plainly it was not intended that the obligation should be greater in the one case than in the other,
merely because the applicant chose to furnish personal
instead of collateral security. The effect of Form 738A
is that the applicant's obligation shall be discharged by
the payment of any internal revenue taxes, interest, penalties and liabilities accruing to the United States by reason of a breach of the condition; and it cannot be doubted
that this was intended, in like manner, to be the measure
of the obligation incurred under a surety bond on the
corresponding Form 738.
This view is emphasized by the consideration of the
new Forms 1408 and 1409 prescribed by Regulations 60.
It is clear that Form 1408 is not one for a penalty or
forfeiture, but is one for indemnity merely in respect,
broadly speaking, of the liabilities enumerated in Form
738A. United States v. Chouteau, 102 U. S. 603, 608.
And the fact that these new regulations provided that a
permit holder who had previously given a surety bond on
Form 738 should not be required to give a new bond on
Form 1408 until called upon to make application for a
new permit, is strongly persuasive evidence that the
Commissioner regarded Form 738 as of substantially the
same character as Form 1408, that is, as a bond for indemnity securing the payment of the liabilities enumerated in Form 738A.
Our answer to the certified questions is that: A permit
bond on Form 738 is not a bond for a penalty forfeitable
in its entire amount upon a breach of condition, but is a
bond for indemnity securing the payment of the internal
revenue taxes, interest, penalties, and liabilities accruing
to the United States by reason of the breach.
