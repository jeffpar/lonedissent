Syllabus.

250 U. S.

a portion of the land alleged to have been taken. The
court finding that a former case by it decided against the
owners and here affirmed (Peabody v. United States, 231
U. S. 530), for taking of the same land resulting from instances of gun fire resulting from the same fort and guns,
was identical with this, except for some occasional subsequent acts of gun fire, held that case to be conclusive
of this and rejected the claim on the merits.
Coming to consider this action of the court in the light
of the findings by it made, we are constrained to the conclusion that it was right and that no possible difference
exists between this and the Peabody Case. Before applying this conclusion we say that we find that the record
discloses no ground for the applications here made to
remand and for additional findings.
Judgment affirmed.

its term in another specified company, but, with the knowledge
