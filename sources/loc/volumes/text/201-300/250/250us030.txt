shape of the defendant's label is different from the plaintiff's; the script upon it not only is wholly different from
the other in meaning, to one who reads the two, but hardly
can be said to resemble it as a picture. The two labels are
attached to the bottles in quite unlike modes. The Schlitz
is applied in a spiral around the length of the bottle so as
to make the ends of the label parallel to the sides of the
glass. The defendant's is pasted around the bottom of
the bottle in the usual way. This diversity of itself renders mistake unlikely. If there were deception it seems to
us that it would arise from beer and brown color and that
it could not be said that the configuration appreciably
helped. Coats v. Merrick Thread Co., 149 U. S. 562, 573.
Beyond stating the principles to be applied there is little
to be said except to compare the impression made by the
two, or, if that form of statement is preferred, the memory
of Schlitz with the presence of the defendant's bottles
as marked.
Decree affirmed.

collected" within the meaning of the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256,
37 Stat. 240, although the payment was without protest or reservation, and under that act the right to a refund is barred if the claim
was not presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on or
before January 1, 1914.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. H. T. Newcomb for appellant.
The Solicitor General for the United States.
MR. JusTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is a suit to recover $6,721.71 paid for a tax upon
the distributive shares of the children of Walter H. Coleman in his personal property. The tax was demanded and
paid under the Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, § 29, 30 Stat.
448, 464, 465. The later Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160,
§ 3, 32 Stat. 406, directed the refunding of so much of
such taxes "as may have been collected on contingent
beneficial interests which shall not have been vested prior
to July first," 1902, and forbade a tax to be imposed upon
such an interest. On July 1, 1902, Coleman was dead but
his debts had not been paid, the year allowed for the proof
of claims against his estate had not expired, and the expenses of administration had not been ascertained. Therefore, it is said, the interest of his children still was contingent. United States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106. McCoach
v. Pratt, 236 U. S. 562. The tax was collected on May 29,
1903. On March 17, 1914, the claimants applied to the
Collector of Internal Revenue and through him to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue to refund it. The application was rejected and on March 9, 1916, the claimant
began this suit. The Court of Claims held that it was
barred by the Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240.

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

250 U. S.

That statute provides that "all claims for the refunding
of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected" under the above mentioned § 29 of the Act of June 13, 1898, "or of any sums
alleged to have been excessive, or in any manner wrongfully collected under the provisions of said Act may
be presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on
or before the first day of January, nineteen hundred and
fourteen, and not thereafter." By § 2 payment of clains
so presented is directed. The act is entitled "An Act
Extending the time for the repayment of certain warrevenue taxes erroneously collected," and the claimant
contends that the present claim is not of that sort, that
this tax having been paid without protest or any reservation of rights, the claim is only for a bounty conferred by
the Act of 1902 and that the benevolence of that act
never has been withdrawn. But, bounty or not, the
direction in the Act of 1902 was on the footing that the
sums ordered to be repaid were collected erroneously,
Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, and was an order for
the refunding of a tax alleged to have been erroneously
collected. The present tax had not been collected when
the Act of June 27, 1902, was passed, but was collected
afterwards contrary to its terms. There was little bounty
in its application to such a case. No argument can make
it plainer than do the words themselves that the Act of
1912 applies to the present claim, and that it was presented too late.
Judgment affirmed.
