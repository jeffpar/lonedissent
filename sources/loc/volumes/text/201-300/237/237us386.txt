Mansfield's Digest of the Laws of Arkansas.
The same ruling also applies to an allotment of a full blooded Chickasaw Indian.

PIGEON v. BUCK.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the

court.
The opinion in McDougal v. McKay, announced today,
ante, p. 372, considers and decides the questions involved
in these writs of error and necessitates affirmation of the
judgments of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in both
causes.
In No. 199, Pigeon v. Buck, all parties were enrolled fullblooded Creek Indians. The allottee, Lowiney Harjo,
having received a patent to certain land, died July. 12,
1905, intestate, without descendants, leaving father,
mother, brothers, sister and her husband. Thereafter the
father and mother-John and Mate Pigeon-claiming the
land must be treated as an ancestral estate which passed
to them in fee, conveyed their interest therein to Buck.
The brothers and sister, maintaining that it was a new
acquisition in the deceased and the father and mother
took only a life estate with remainder in themselves, instituted suit to have their rights declared. The Supreme
Court of Oklahoma (38 Oklahoma, 101) held the estate
was ancestral and went half to the father and half to the
mother according to the applicable provisions of chapter 49, Mansfield's Digest, Statutes of Arkansas.
. In No. 275, Roberts v. Underwood, the land in question was allotted and patented to a full-blooded Chickasaw Indian who thereafter and in 1907 died intestate,
leaving no descendants. A contest arose between his
paternal relatives, Underwood and Byrd, and a maternal
relative, Roberts, concerning their respective interests in
the property. Under the Act of April 28, 1904, ยง 2, c. 1824,
33 Stat. 573, the devolution depended upon chapter 49,
Mansfield's Digest, Statutes of Arkansas. The Supreme
Court of Oklahoma (38 Oklahoma, 376) adjudged the
estate must be treated as ancestral and that half passed
to the paternal relatives and half to the maternal one.
Affirmed.
