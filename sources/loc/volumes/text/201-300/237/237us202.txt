ing the jurisdiction of this court to review the judgments
of Circuit Courts of Appeals has led to a like conclusion.
Macfadden v. United States, 213 U. S. 288. Besides,
when looked at comprehensively, in view of the fact
that the provisions of the Judicial Code were obviously
intended not to enlarge the jurisdiction of this court but
to relieve it, and considering in this light the omissions
and the limitations therein expressed and the power to
certiorari stated in ยง 251, the conclusion is irresistible
that the intent and purpose of the act was, while narrowing the imperative jurisdiction, to create an equipoise
by extending the voluntary or discretionary exercise of
jurisdiction by means of the writ of certiorari,-a purpose
which would be wholly frustrated if the contention as
to jurisdiction now insisted upon were sustained.
Dismissedfor want of jurisdiction.

v. 'UNITED

APPEAI4 FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 202. Submitted March 11, 1915.-Decided April 12, 1915.
Where a railroad company transports property and troops of the United
States over a continuous line of railroad part of which is free-haul
and the remaining part is pay line, the character of the shipment
fixes the rate and the Government can be charged a proportionate
part of the through rate only, and not the local rate on that part of
the haul which is over the pay line.
A provision in a railroad land grant statute that the government shall
always have the right to ship over the line at fair and reasonable rates
not to exceed those paid by private parties entitles the Government

to the benefit of the long haul rate and to pay the proportionate part
of the rate and not be charged the local rate over the pay line.
48 Ct. Cl. 227, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve questions relating to the

amount which the United States can be charged for transportation over a land grant railway, are stated in the

opinion.
Mr. A. A. Hoehling, Jr., for appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson for the United
States.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the

court.
The appellant, the Southern Pacific Company, operates
under a lease a line of road from San Francisco, via Roseville Junction, to Portland. The line to Roseville Junction, a distance of 108.03 miles, was built as part of the

main line extending from San Francisco to Ogden, Utah,
by the Central Pacific Railroad Company under an act
of Congress of July 1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489). By ยง 6 of that
act the land grants for the construction of the road were
made "upon condition that said company . . . shall

transport mails, troops, and muni-

tions of war, supplies, and public stores upon said railroad
for the Government, whenever required to do so by any
department thereof, and that the Government shall at
all times have the preference in the use of the same for all
the purposes aforesaid (at fair and reasonable rates of
compensation,. not to exceed the amounts paid by private
parties for the same kind of service).

'

The line from Roseville Junction to Portland, a distance of 663.91 miles, was constructed under the act of

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

237 U. S.'

Congress approved July 25, 1866 (14 Stat. 239). Section 5 of that act provided:
"And said railroad shall be and remain a public highway
for the use of the Government of the United States, free
of all toll or other charges upon the transportation of the
property or troops of the United States: And the same
shall be transported over said road at the cost, charge,
and expense of the corporations or companies owning or
operating the same, when so required by the Government
of the United States."
Between August, 1897, and March, 1902, the Southern
Pacific Company transported for the United States persons and property over said line .via Roseville Junction
"from points on either side thereof to points on the
other side; thus, from San Francisco, Ogden, and other
points
.
to Portland via Roseville Junction. The
shipments in question did not originate at Roseville Junction nor terminate at Roseville Junction, but were carried
through on one continuous transit over both the free haul
and the nonfree haul portions of the road precisely as any
through shipment is carried for a private shipper." (Finding VI.)
For the services thus rendered the company presented
its bills to the accounting officers of the Government in
which, while nothing was charged for services rendered
over the portion of the road which was free, the local rate
was exacted between San Francisco and Roseville Junction. We say the local rate because it is certain that at
the times in question the railroad had duly established
and published schedules of rates embracing local rates to
Roseville Junction as well as through rates to Portland
and other points via Roseville Junction, the local rates
being higher than the through rates. The accounting
officers refused to allow the claims in full insisting that
the Government was entitled to the benefit of the through
rate. They therefore distributed the through rate over

Opinion of the Court.

the whole distance and deducted from the aggregate of
the bills the difference between the sum which had been
made up by charging the local rate and the sum which
would be due charging only the through rate ascertained
upon the mileage basis as above stated. The sum remaining due under the operation of this method was received
by the railroad company under protest and this suit was
commenced in the court below to recover the difference.
Upon the finding of the facts above stated and the
legal conclusion that under the statutes the railroad was
without right to refuse to allow the through, and charge
the local, rate its claim was rejected. 48 Ct. Cls. 227.
This appeal was then prosecuted.
There is no controversy concerning the method by
which the sum of the applicable through rate was ascertained by the accounting officers of the Government.
There are, hence, as stated in the argument of appellant,
no disputed facts, and the question for decision is a narrow one since, as further stated in that argument:
"The present appeal presents but a single question of
law, and that is as to the legal rate of compensation to
which the railroad company is entitled for the transportation of property and troops of the United States over a
continuous line of railroad, part of which is free-haul and
the remaining part of which is pay line."
The entire theory upon which it is contended that the
through shipments could be subjected to a local rate from
San Francisco northward to Roseville Junction and southward from Roseville Junction to San Francisco finds clear
expression in the argument on behalf of the railroad company as follows:
"While there is a continuous rail line between those two
points [San Francisco and Portland] the line itself, from
the standpoint of compensation or pay to the railroad
company, breaks at Roseville Junction; south of that point
it is 'pay' line; north thereof, it is 'free-haul' line; and it

so happens that appellant' company, as lessee, operates
both lin6."
1. But the error of the proposition is manifest as it confounds cause and effect since it assumes the unassumable,
that is, that the question of whether traffic is to have the
benefit of the lesser through rate or be subjected to the
higher local rate is to be determined by the sum of the
compensation asked for its carriage instead of by the nature and character of the movement of the traffic, that is,
whether it was a through or a local movement. In other
words, the proposition is, not that the character of the
movement fixes the rate, but that the rate determines the
character of the movement. The confusion involved in,
and the destructive results which would flow from, the
proposition cannot be better illustrated than by considering that 'the foundation upon which a lesser charge is
justified for a through shipment than is exacted for a local
shipment is the less cost to the carrier of doing the through
business than is incurred in doing the local business.
Therefore, to adopt the proposition would require a reversal of the standards by which the character of traffic
is fixed. And the terms in which the contention is stated
bring out in bold relief the fallacy which it contains, since
while it admits "there is a continuous rail line between
those two points" (San Francisco and Portland), it yet
declares that "the line itself, from the standpoint of compensation or pay to the railway company, breaks at Roseville Junction;" that is, not that the continuous physical
line of rail over which the through transportation moves
is in any way broken, but that by a break (change) in the
line of compensation an imaginary break in the physical
line itself is to be assumed to the end that a shipment
which is inherently through may be converted into one
which is essentially local.
2. But apart from the mere question of the abstract
error in the proposition relied upon, it is clear that to

Opinion of the Court.

accept it would give rise to a plain violation of the provisions of the act of Congress governing the movement of
traffic over the road from San Francisco to Roseville Junction, since that act exacts that the Government shall at
all times have the right to ship over the road "at fair and
reasonable rates of compensation, not to exceed the
amounts paid by private parties for the same kind of
service." As the findings clearly establish that the schedules filed and published contained a through rate for a
shipment from San Francisco to Portland via Roseville
Junction, and vice versa, it would seem to be indisputable
that by the very terms of the act such through rate so
published and filed was open and available to the United
States for its through shipments. This must be the case
unless it can be said that because the United States had
acquired an increased advantage concerning the movement of its shipments from Roseville Junction to Portland, therefore it had lost the right to have its through
shipments treated as such from San Francisco to Roseville
Junction. And it is to be observed that there is no ground
for saying that the existence of the right in favor of the
United States to a free haul beyond Roseville Junction to
Portland subjected the road in hauling from Roseville
Junction to San Francisco, or vice versa, to a greater cost,
since the findings in express terms establish that the freight
shipped through by the United States was carried by a
continuous movement under exactly similar conditions as
was all other through freight carried for private individuals.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.
