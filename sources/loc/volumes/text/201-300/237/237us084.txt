ance of the reversion, or of any interest therein, was clearly
prohibited by the testriction.
From every point of view, we must conclude that a
lease for ten years, made in 1905, subject to an existing
lease for ten years, of the same property, which by its
terms was to run until 1912, was unauthorized and void.
As the United States was entitled to maintain the suit
to cancel these instruments as transgressing the statutory
restriction, it is unnecessary to consider the question
whether, in the absence of such a violation, the Government would have capacity to sue to redress alleged frauds
committed against allottees.
The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

ROBINSON v. BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 167.

Argued March 3, 4, 1915.-Decided April 5, 1915.

In a suit for personal injuries under the Employers' Liability Act, a
contract between the plaintiff and a third party may be admissible
in evidence on the trial to show that plaintiff was not defendant's
employ6 even though a demurrer had been sustained to a special
plea that the contract contained a release of liability.
A contract between the Pullman Company, as employer, and its employ6 releasing the employer, and also all railroad corporations over

whose lines the employer's cars were operated, from all claims for
liability in personal injury sustained by the employ6, held in this
case valid unless the employ6 of the Pullman Company was also the
employ6 of the railroad company, in which case that provision of the
contract would be invalid under § 5 of the Employers' Liability Act.
Congress in legislating on the subject of carriers by rail was familiar
with the situation and used the term employ6 in its natural sense and
did not intend to include as employds of the carrier persons on interstate trains engaged in various services for other masters.

Employers' Liability Act and its application to employ~s

Mr. Levi H. David, with whom Mr. Alexander Wold was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Plaintiff was an employ6 of the railroad company
either as a matter of law or of fact, and whether he was in
the employ, jointly and severally, of the railroad company
and the Pullman Company, he was entitled to have his
case submitted to the jury under the Employers' Liability
Act of 1908. Pennsylvania Co. v. Roy, 102 U. S. 451;

MR.JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of the court.

George R. Robinson, the plaintiff in error, brought this
action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained
by him while performing his duty as a porter in chargeof a
Pullman car which was being hauled by the defendant as
a part of an interstate train. The injuries were received
in a collision which was due, it'was alleged, to the defendant's negligence. The defendant introduced -in evidence
the plaintiff's contract of employment 1 with the Pullman
I The material portions of the contract are as follows:
"Be it known, That I, the undersigned, hereby accept employment
by, and enter into, or continue from this date, in the service of, The'
Pullman Company upon the following express terms, conditions and
agreements, which in consideration of such. employment and the wages
thereof I do hereby make with said The Pullman Company, to wit:
"First. So long'as. I shall remain in said employment and service, I
will fully comply with all regulations, rules and orders of said Company
or its agents, issued for the government of its employ~s, go wherever
I may be required in said service, and well, faithfully and honestly
perform all tluties assigned to me.
"Second. My wages shall'at all times be calculated and paid at the
monthly rate per day for the number of days I shall have been actually

Company, by which he released all railroad corporations
over whose lines the cars of that company might be operated while he was traveling in its service.'from all claims
for liability of any nature or character whatsoever on
account of any personal injury or death.' The trial court
directed a verdict in favor of the defendant and the judgemployed, and I may quit or resign, or may be suspended or discharged
from such employment and service, at any time, or at any place, without previous notice.
"Fourth. I assume all risks of accidents or casualties by railway
travel or otherwise, incident to such employment and service, and
hereby, for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators or legal representatives, forever release, acquit and discharge The Pullman Company, and its officers and employ6s, from any and all claims for liability
of any nature or character whatsoever, on account of any personal
injury or death to me in such employment or service.
"Fifth. I am aware that said The Pullman Company secures the
operation of its cars upon lines of railroad, and hence my opportunity
for employment, by means of contracts, wherein said The Pullman
Company agrees to indemnify the corporationp or persons owning or
controlling such lines of railroad against liability on their part to the
employds of said The Pullman Company in cases provided for in such
contracts, and I do hereby ratify all such contracts made or to be made
by said The Pullman Company and do agree to protect, indemnify
and hold harmless said The Pullman Company with respect to any and
all sums of money it may be compelled to pay, or liability it may be
subject to, under any such contract, in consequence of any injury or
death happening to me, and this agreement may be assigned to any
such corporation or person and used in its defense.
"Sixth. I will obey all rules and regulations made or to be made for
the government of their own employ~s by the corporations or persons
over whose lines of railroad the cars of said The Pullman Company
may be operated while I am traveling over said lines in the employment
or service of said The Pullman Company; and I expressly declare that
while so traveling I shall not have the rights of a passenger with respect
to such corporations or persons, which rights I do expressly renounce;
and I hereby, for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators or legal
representatives, forever release, acquit and discharge any and all such
corporations and persons from all claims for liability of any'nature or
character whatsoever on account of any personal injury or death to me
whil6 in said employment or service."

Opinion of the Court.

ment, entered accordingly, was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals. .40 App. D. C. 169.
•The plaintiff in error complains of the admission of the
contract in evidence, in view of the fact that a demurrer to
a special plea setting up the release had been sustained;
but, if the contract was a defense, it cannot be said that
the court erred in giving effect to it, despite the earlier
ruling. The evidence was admissible under the plea of
not guilty. Brown v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., 6 App. D. C. 237,
242; Shafer v. Stonebraker, 4 Gill & J. (Md.) 345, 355,
356; Johnson v. Philadelphia &c. R. R., 168 Pa. St. 127,
133. It is also clear that, unless condemned by statute,
the contract was a valid one and a bar to recovery. Balt.
& Ohio &c. Rwy. v. Voigt, 176 U. S. 498; Sante Fe &c.
Rwy. v. Grant Co., 228 U. S. 177.
The substantial question is whether the contract of
release was iivalid under § 5 of the Employers' Liability
Act, of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, which provides
that 'any contract . . . the purpose or intent of
which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt
itself from any liability created by this Act, shall to that
extent be void.' The application of this provision depends
upon the plaintiff's employment. For the 'liability
created' by the Act is a liability to the 'employ~s' of the
carrier, and not to others; and the plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of the provision unless he was 'employed' by the Railroad Company within the meaning
of the Act. it will be observed that the question is not
whether the Railroad Company, by virtue of its duty to
passengers of which it cannot divest itself by any arrangement with a sleeping car company, would not be liable for
the negligence of a sleeping car porter in matters involving
the passenger's safety (Pennsylvania Co. v. Roy, 102 U. S.
451). Nor are we here concerned with the measure of the
obligation of the Railroad Company, in the absence of
special -contract, to one in the plaintiff's situation by

reason of the fact that he was lawfully on the train, although not a passenger. The inquiry rather is whether
the plaintiff comes within the statutory description, that
is, whether upon the facts disclosed in the record it can be
said that within the sense of the Act the plaintiff was an
employ4 of the Railroad Company, or whether he is not
to be regarded as outside that description being, in truth,
on the train simply in the character of a servant of another
master by whom he was hired, directed and paid, and at
whose will he was to be continued in service or discharged.
The contract between the Pullman Company and the
Railroad Company was introduced in evidence. Without
attempting to state its details, it is sufficient to say that
the case was not one of co-proprietorship (see Oliver v.
Northern Pacific R. R., 196 Fed. Rep. 432, 435). It
appeared that there was supplied by the Pullman Company on its own cars a distinct and separate service which
was performed by its own employ~s under its own management. For this service the Pullman Company charged
its customary rates. It was provided that the Railroad
Company should not receive compensation from the
Pullman Company for the movement of cars furnished
under the contract nor should the Pullman Company be
paid for their use. But whenever the gross revenue from
sales of seats and berths in the Pullman cars exceeded an
average of $7,750 per car per annum the Pullman Company was to pay to the Railroad Company one-half of the
excess; and if the average gross revenue from the Pullman
cars (from causes beyond the control of the Pullman
Company) was less than $6,000 per car per, annum for
two consecutive years that company was entitled to terminate the agreement upon twelve months' notice, with
the option, however, on the part of the Railroad Company,
to pay to the Pullman Company such sum as would bring
the gross revenue up to the specified amount or to purchase
the cars at a price to be determined.- We think it to be

ROBINSON v. BALT. & OHIO R. R.

Opinion of the Court.

clear that in employing its servants the Pullman Company
did not act as the agent of the Railroad Company. The
service provided by the Pullman Company was, it is true,
subject to the exigencies of railroad transportation, and
the Railroad Company had the control essential to the
performance of its functions as a common carrier. To this
end the employs of the Pullman Company were bound
by the rules and regulations of the Railroad Company.
This authority of the latter was commensurate with its
duty, and existed only that it might perform its paramount
obligation.
With this limitation, the Pullman Company supplied
its own facilities and for this purpose organized and controlled its own service, including the service of porters;
it selected its servants, defined their duties, fixed and paid
their wages, directed and supervised the performance of
their tasks, and placed and removed them at its pleasure.
See Hughson v. Richmond & Danville R. R., 2 App. D. C.
98; McDermon v. Southern Pacific Co., 122 Fed. Rep. 669;
Jones v. St. Louis &c. Rwy., 125 Missouri, 666; Chicago
&c. R. R. v. Hamler, 215 Illinois, 525. It is said that the
plaintiff had been promoted to be a 'porter in charge' of
the Pullman car between Washington and Wheeling, with
increased compensation, but he still was the porter of the
Pullman Company, employed in its work. It is insisted
that he should be regarded as the employ6 of the Railroad
Company because of the fact that in the case of passengers
coming on the train after three o'clock in the morning, he
received the railroad ticket or fare which he placed in an
envelope and gave to the train conductor. 'when he came
back'; the railroad ticket was punched or canceled by the
conductor. This, however, was an obvious accommodation to the passenger in the Pullman car, and in any event
it was merely an incidental matter which cannot be deemed
to qualify the character of plaintiff's employment as it
is to be viewed from the standpoint of the statute.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Syllabus.

237 U. S.

We are of the opinion that Congress used the words
'employd' and 'employed' in the statute in their natural
sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation
of employer and employ6. It was well known that there
were on interstate trains persons engaged in various serv-

ices for other masters. Congress, familiar with this situation, did not use any appropriate expression which could
be taken to indicate a purpose to include such persons
among those to whom the railroad company was to be
liable under the Act.
We conclude that the plaintiff, in error was not an employ6 of the defendant company within the meaning of
the Employers' Liability Act, and that the judgment
must be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
