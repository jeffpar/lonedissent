ERIE RAILROAD v. SOLOMON.
237 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY v. SOLOMON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.
No. 559.

Argued February 24, 1915.-Decided May 10, 1915.

Writ of error to review the judgment of a state court, in an action for
personal injuries based on the Safety Appliance Law of the State
substantially identical with the Federal law, and affirmed by the
intermediate appellate and the highest court of the State without
opinion, dismissed for want of jurisdiction under ยง 237, Judicial Code.
Even if the highest court of the State, after affirmance, certified as part
of the record the fact that it had been necessary to consider the Fedcral Safety Appliance Act and to determine whether the Ohio Safety
Appliance Act, as construed by the trial court, is not repuguant to
the Fourteenth Amendment, the Federal questions suggested as the
basis for the writ of error in this case are so frivolous as not to afford

jurisdiction under, ยง 237, Judicial Code.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the Safety Appliance Act and the jurisdiction
of this court under ยง237, Judicial Code, are stated in the
opinion.
Mr. Leroy Manchester, with whom Mr. C. D. Hine was
on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
A right, privilege and immunity from liability was
asserted and denied under the provisions of the Safety
Appliance Act of the United States. The Federal Safety
Appliance Act controls. The coupler satisfies the statute.
A right, privilege, and immunity from liability was

asserted and denied under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Mr. Emil J. Anderson for defendant in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the

court.
Solomon, the defendant in error, sued to recover for
personal injuries suffered by him while he was working
as a brakeman on a switch engine in the yard of the defendant company at Youngstown, Ohio. The negligence
charged was.that the tender of the engine had a defective
coupler in that the knuckle and pin on the same could not
be worked without going between the cars and that
the draw-bar had so much side play that it would not
meet the couplers of other cars and therefore would not

91itomatically couple by impact. The first defect may be
put out of view as the jury found it did not exist. As to
the second, the respective contentions at the trial were,
on the part of the plaintiff, that the play of the draw-bar
was so great as to cause the coupler to be defective, and
on the part of the defendant, that while the draw-bar may
have had some side play it only existed to the degree
which was essential in such an appliance and therefore
there was no defect.. The trial court submitted the case
to the jury on the theory that the coupler was defective
if it had an unusual- side play and conversely that it was
not if it did not have such a degree of side play. From the
pleadings and the course of the trial there is no room for
dispute that the case was tried upon the theory that the
right to recover was based on the Safety Appliance Law
of Ohio, substantially identical in its terms with the
Safety Appliance Law of the United States. The judgment on the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff
was affirmed without opinion by the Circuit Court and
again affirmed without opinion by the Supreme Court of
Ohio to which judgment the writ of error now before us
was prosecuted.
Confining the case to the statement just made it is beyond dispute that there is no jurisdiction to review, but
it is insisted that the case is not so confined because after
affirmance the court below entered an order which it
directed should be made part of the record certifying that
in deciding the case it became necessary for it to consider
whether the United States Safety Appliance Law was
applicable and whether as construed by the trial court the
state law if applicable was not repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But assuming
that the recited Federal questions are in' the record and
require consideration, they are so without merit and frivolous as not to give basis for jurisdiction: Fiist, because
such plainly is the result of the contention that error to

Opinion of the Court.

the prejudice of the defendant company concerning the
United States Safety Appliance Law, if that law applied,
was committed by instructing that it exacted a usual,
that is, ordinary degree of care in the appliances to which
that act related. And second, because a like view inevitably is necessary concerning the contention that the
State Safety Appliance Law, if it applied, would be repugnant' to the Fourteenth Amendment if it exacted a
usual and ordinary degree of care. But this is not adequate to dispose of the case since the argument 'is that
error as to the recited Federal question directly arose
from the refusal of the court to instruct a verdict for the
Railroad Company on the ground that there was no proof
tending to show an unusual or any defect in the coupler,
thereby permitting the jury to find a liability under the
law of the United States where none existed, and under
the theory of the application of the state law, causing
such law to impose a liability for an appliance which was
not defective, and hence to take property without due
process of law. But while the proposition changes the
form of the contention, it does not change the substance
of things since we are of the opinion after an examination
of the record 'that the contention that the case should
have been taken from the jury on the ground stated is so
wholly devoid of merit and wanting in substance as to
afford no basis for jurisdiction. As a proposition which
is unsubstantial and frivolous cannot be made substantial
by asserting another proposition of the same character,
it results that there is no ground for the exercise of jurisdiction and the writ of error is therefore
Dismissedfor want of jurisdiction.
