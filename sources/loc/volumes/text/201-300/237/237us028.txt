UNITED STATES v. EMERY, BIRD, THAYER
REALTY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 117.

Argued January 12, 13, 1915.-Decided April 5,1915.

The District Court, sitting as a Court of Claims, under § 24 (20 subd.)
has jurisdiction over claims against the United States for refunding
taxes paid under the Corporation Tax law under duress and protest
to the Collector and by him turned over to the United States.
The great act of justice embodied in the Court of Claims is not to be
construed strictly and with an adverse eye.
A realty corporation simply collecting and distributing rent from a
specified parcel of land is not doing business within the meaning of
the Corporation Tax Law of 1909. Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate,
220 U. S. 170, followed; Cedar St. Realty Co. v. Park Realty Co.,
220 U. S. 107, distinguished.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court sitting as a Court of Claims and also of the validity
of a tax imposed under the Corporation Tax Law of 1909,
are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Solicitor General Davis, with whom Mr. Karl W.
Kirchwey was on the brief, for the United States:
The District Court was without jurisdiction of the suit.
The remedy, if any, is an action against the collector,
expressly provided by statute. Nichols v. United States,
7 Wall. 122.
Where a revenue act expressly provides a particular
remedy for the recovery of taxes illegally assessed and
paid, such remedy is exclusive. Arnson v. Murphy, 109
U. S. 238, 243; Cheatham v. United States, 92 U. S. 85,

Argument for Defenxdant in Error.

Hence a suit against the United States does not lie.

the meaning of the Corporation Tax Act of 1909. Corporation Tax Cases, 220 U. S. 107, 171.

Mr. Albert R. Strother, with whom Mr. James G. Smart
was on the brief, for defendant in error:
The District Court had jurisdiction. Nichol'; v. United
States, 7 Wall. 122, distinguished.
The statute gives no special exclusive rem(:dy.
The cases subsequent to the Nichols Case establish the
proposition that the court had jurisdiction in this case.
The realty company was not liable to the tax. The

Mr. Everett P. Wheeler filed a brief as amicus curiae.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit under the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911,
c. 231, § 24, par. 20, 36 Stat. 1087, 1093, formerly the Tucker
Act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, §§ 1, 2, 24 Stat. 505, to recover the amount of taxes paid under protest. It presents
two questions: Whether the District Court sitting as a
Court of Claims had jurisdiction of this case; and whether
the claimant, the defendant in error, was 'engaged in
business' or 'doing business' within the meaning of the
Corporation Tax Law of August 5, 1909, c. 6, § 38, 36 Stat.
11, 112. The District Court asserted its jurisdiction and
gave judgment for the claimant. 198 Fed. Rep. 242.
The facts do not need lengthy statement. The Emery,
Bird, Thayer Dry Goods Company, a business corporation
of Kansas City, Missouri, occupied certain lands, partly
hired and partly owned by it, for the. purposes of its
business. Eighteen months before the passage of the
Corporation Tax Law its members decided that the claimant should be organized, and it was, for the purpose of
acquiring the Dry Goods Company's lands and of letting
the same to the Dry Goods Company, the latter having

Opinion of the Court.

the management of the property and assuming the responsibilities in respect of it. The only business done by
the claimant was to keep up its corporate organization and
to collect and distribute the rent received from its single
lessee; and the Court found as a fact that it was not doing
business within the statute, subject, of course,, to the question whether the activities stated constituted such doing
business as matter of law. The chartered powers of the
claimant included performing and enforcing the performance of the respective covenants in the leases taken over
and the sale of the property or any part of it upon the vote
of not less than two-thirds of the stockholders, who were
very nearly the same-as those of the Dry Goods Company.
It also covenanted to rebuild in case the buildings were
destroyed. But there has been no occasion to perform
any of these undertakings.-The taxes in question were
paid under duress and protest, and were turned over by
the Collector to the United States, which still retuins them.
A claim to have the taxes refunded was submitted in due
form to the Collector of Internal Revenue, but repayment
was denied.
The objection to the jurisdiction pressed by the Government is that the only remedy is a suit against the Collector.
As the United States has received and keeps the money
and would indemnify the Collector if he had to pay, Rev.
Stat. 3220, the least that can be said is that it would be
adding a fifth wheel to the coach to require a circuitous
process to satisfy just claims. It is true that this tax law
provides that 'all laws relating to the collection, remission,
and refund of internal revenue taxes, so far as applicable'
&c., are extended to this tax, c. 61, § 38, 36 Stat. 11, 117,
but that is far from the case of a statute creating a new
right and a special remedy to enforce it in such form as
to make that remedy exclusive. The right to sue the Collector for an unjustified collection was given by the common law.-The jurisdiction over suits against the United

237 U. S.

States under § 24, Twentieth, of the Judicial Code, extends
to 'all claims not exceeding ten thousand dollars founded
upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of
Congress.' However gradually the result may have been
apprmached in the earlier cases it now has becqfne accepted
law that c4aims like the present are .'founded upon' the
reyenue lw. The argument that there is a distinction
between claims 'arisingunder' (Judicial Code, § 24, First)
and those 'founded upot' (id., § 24, Twentieth),_a law of
the United States, rests on the inadmissible premise that
the great act of justice embodied in the jurisdibction of the
Courtf of Claims is to be construed strictly and read with
an adverse eye. Dooley v. United States) 182 U. S. 222, 228.
United States v. Hvoslef, March 22, 1915, ante, p. 1. Jurisdiction was taken for granted in United States V. N. Y. &
Cuba S. S. Co., 200 U. S. 488, and was upheld in ChristieStreet Commission Co. v. United States, 136 Fed. Rep. 326.
United States v. Hyams, 146 Fed. Rep. 15, 18. United
States v. Finch, 201 Fed. Rep. 95, 97.
Being of opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction
we pass to the merits. They also may be disposed of without much discussion. The line"lies between Cedar Street
Co. v. Park Realty Co., 220 U. S. 107, 170, and Zonne v.
Minneapolis Syndicate, 220 U. S.187; the latter case being
carried perhaps a little farther by McCoach v. Minehill
Railway, 228 U. S.295. We are of opinion that this case
is governed by the last two and that the decision was right.
The question is rather what the corporation is doing than
what it could do, 228 U. S.305, 306, but looking even to its
powers they are limited very nearly to the necessary incidents of holding a specific tract of land. The possible sale
of the whole would be merely the winding up of the corporation. That of a part would signify that the Dry Goods
Company did not need it. The claimants' characteristic
charter function and the only one that it was carrying on
was the bare receipt and distribution to its stockholders

of rent from a specified parcel of land. Unless its bare
existence as an intermediary was doing business, it is hard
to imagine how it could be less engaged.

OF NEW ORLEANS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.

No. 192. Argued March 11, 1915.-Decided April 5, 1915.
The fact that water used for drinking and bathing goes into the sewer
after it has been used does not make it water for sewerage purposes.
Act No. 270, Louisiana, of 1908, and ordinance of the City of New
Orleans thereunder establishing rates for water for drinking and
domestic purposes other than sewerage is not unconstitutional as
impairing the obligation of the statute of August, 1897, providing
for free water for sewerage purposes.
Where the later Act complained of goes no farther than the prior act,
the obligation of whose contract is claimed to have been impaired,
there is no ground for invoking the jurisdiction of this court under
§ 237, Jud. Coda, and the writ will be dismissed.

facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
obligation of contract clause of the Federal Constitution
of certain statutes of Louisiana and ordinances of New
Orleans relative to drainage and water supply, are stated
in the opinion.
