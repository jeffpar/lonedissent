-HENIKEL v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR7 TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 142.

Argued-Jsnuary'20, 21, 1915.-Decided April 5, 1915.

There is no question of the authority of the United States to devote
the Indian lands involved in this actioi to irrigation purposes.
Under the provisions of the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, the Secretary of the Interior had power to acquire all rights and property
tecessary therefor, including those of allottee Indians, by paying for
their improvements and giving them the right of selecting other lands.
The restrictions on alienation of lands allotted to Indians within the
area of the Milk River Irrigation Project did not extend to prohibiting an allottee Indian from selling his improvements to the United
States and selecting other lands so that the United States could use
the lands selected for purposes of an irrigation project as provided
by act of Congress.
In this case held that the mother of Indian minors whose father was not
an Indian was the natural guardian -and her relinquishment of the
original allotment on their behalf was proper and binding.
196 Fed. Rep. 345, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the rights of allottee Indians
and the power of the Government to purchase improvements and make new allotments where the land allotted is
needed for reclamation purposes, are stated in the opinion.

District of Montana, to recover certain lands in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The defendants (now plaintiffs
in error) other than Henry Henkel are members of the
Piegan Tribe of Indians. Henry Henkel is the husband
of Caroline Henkel and the other defendants to the action
are their children. They lived together as a family and
occupied the lands in question, upon which they had
constructed certain buildings and improvements. On
November 5, 1906, Caroline Henkel, for herself and two
daughters, together with her two sons George Henkel
and William Henkel, executed a document addressed to
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, by which, describing
themselves as members of the -Piegan Tribe of Indians,
they undertook to relinquish all claims to lands and
buildings then occupied by them on the Blackfeet Indian
Reservation, Montana, comprising about 800 acres of
land, the lands being situated at the foot of Lower St.
Mary Lake, and south of Swift Current Creek. The conditions of the surrender of the lands for use in connection
with the proposed St. Mary Reservoir -of the United States
Reclamation Service were that they should be paid the
sum of $7,500 for the improvements on such selections, and
be subsequently allowed to select allotments of equal area,
or as provided by law, from the unoccupied lands of the
Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. Henry Henkel, as
husband and father, concurred in the agreement and endorsed his approval thereon.
On February 15, 1907, the price named in the instrument just referred to, seven thousand five hundred dollars,
was paid to Caroline Henkel, who for herself and two
daughters, and George and William Henkel, for themselves, relinquished to the United States all their right,
title and claim in and to the lands and buildings then
occupied by them on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation,
Montana, and located at the foot of Lower St. Mary-Lake
and south of Swift Current Creek, and released the United

States from all claims for damages to. all improvements of
whatsoever nature on the land. This receipt and release
was also agreed to by the husband, Henry Henkel.
These facts are set up in the complaint, and it is averred
that pursuant to the Act of Congress of June 17, 1902.
c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, the Government had made investigations of and surveys for an irrigation project which was
known as the Milk River Irrigation Project, under and by
virtue of which certain lands in the northern part of the
State of Montana were to be irrigated; that among other
works forming part of the system to be established, a dam
was to be built at the foot of the Lower St. Mary Lake,
by which the lands above mentioned, and now in controversy, were to be flooded, and that the same were necessary for flooding in connection with the reclamation
project above referred to.
The defendants answered, admitting the execution and
delivery of the instrument above referred to, and the payment of the money, as recited in the release and receipt.
They averred that they were all members of the Piegan
Tribe of Indians, except Henry Henkel, and had the right
as such Indians to be upon the Blackfeet Indian Reservation; that they had settled upon the lands in question
more than ten years before the beginning of this suit,
which, since a recent survey, were designated by congressional subdivisions, and embraced the land in controversy,
and ever since their settlement upon said lands they had
occupied the same in common as their home, and since the
passage of the act of March 1, 1907, c. 1015, 2285, 34 Stat.
1035, opening the reservation to settlement, they had
selected such lands as their allotments under that act,
the lands being grazing in character. The answer sets
out the selection of each of the defendants entitled to
allotments and it is alleged that each acquiesced in the
selection made by the other. The answer then avers that
the allotting officers had refused to allot the lands in

question to them, but that under protest William Henkel,
George Henkel and Lizzie Henkel had been allotted lands
elsewhere, which lands they offered to surrender if the
lands selected by them should be allotted to them; the
refusal to allot such lands, as the answer avers, being
based upon the instruments referred to in the complaint.
The answer averred that the lands were at all times since
the execution of these instruments worth more than the'
price offered by the Government, which sum the defendants offered to return.
To this answer a demurrer was sustained by the court,
and the plaintiffs in error electing to stand upon the answer, judgment was rendered accordingly, awarding to
the United States the possession of the premises. The
case was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, where the judgment of the lower court was
affirmed., 196 Fed. Rep. 345. The.case is now here upon
writ of error.
The contention of the plaintiffs in error, defendants
below, is that no statute of the United States has conferred authority upon the Government or its officers
to acquire the lands described by the relinquishment from
the Henkels, as above set forth. Such action, it is contended, would amount to an act of bad faith upon the
part of the Government toward these Indians, in view of
their established rights in these lands; and to permit the
reclamation statute of 1902 to have such effect, it is insisted, would be virtually to permit it to repeal previous
acts of Congress disposing of these lands for the benefit
of the Indians.
A consideration of these matters requires some examination of the previous status of the Indians and what Congress has undertaken to do by legislation in their behalf.
By the act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388,
as-amended February 28, 1891, c. 383, 26 Stat. 794, authority was given to the President, as to any reserva-

tion which he should consider advantageous for agricultural or grazing purposes, to allot, after survey thereof,
"to each Indian located thereon one-eighth of a section
of land"; and if the lands allotted were valuable for
grazing purposes only, to allot to each a quarter-section
of land. Allotments, which were to be set apart under
the provisions of the act were to be selected by the Indians, heads of families selecting for their minor children, in such manner as to embrace the improvements of
the Indians making the selection. Upon the approval of
the allotments by the Secretary of the Interior, patents
were to issue therefor, in the name of the allottees, which
patents should declare that the United States would hold
the lands thus allotted for the period of twenty-five
years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indians
to whom allotted, and that conveyances of land set apart
and allotted as provided in the statute, or any contract
concerning the same, before the expiration of the time
above mentioned, should be null and void. In that act
it was provided that nothing therein contained should
affect the power of Congress to grant the right of way
through any lands granted to an Indian for railroads, or
other highways or telegraph lines, for the public use, or
to condemn such lands to public uses upon making just
compensation.
On September 28, 1895, an agreement was made with
the Indians (29 Stat. 353) which was approved by the
act of June 10, 1896, c. 398, 29 Stat. 321, 355. Article V
of that agreement provides as follows:
"Since the situation of the Blackfeet Reservation
renders it wholly unfit for agriculture, and since these
Indians have shown within the past four years that they
can successfully raise horned cattle, and there is every
probability that they will become self-supporting by
attention to this industry, it is agreed that, during the
existence of this agreement no allotments of land in

severalty shall be made to them, but that this whole
reservation shall continue to be held by these Indians as
a communal grazing tract upon which their herds may
feed undisturbed; and that after the expiration of this
agreement the lands shall continue to be held until such
time as a majority of the adult males of the tribe shall
request in writing that allotment in severalty shall be
made of their lands:" provided, however,
"That any member of the tribe may, with the approval
of the agent in charge, fence in such area of land as he and
the members of his family would be entitled to under the

allotment act and may file with the agent a description
of such land and of the improvements that he has made on
the same, and the filing of such description shall give the
said members of the tribe the right to take such land
when allotments of the land in severalty shall be made."
While the Henkel family had occupied this 800-acre
tract, it does not appear that they had filed a description
of the land and improvements with the agent, so as to
give them the right to take such land when allotment
of the same should be made. Nevertheless, they would
have a strong equity for recognition, in view of their
settlement upon the land and construction of improvements thereon, and but for the relinquishment relied
upon in this case, they might perfect their right to the
allotment. It is to be noted, however, that this agreement, in article VII, contains an important recognition of
a reserved right of the Government to use the lands upon
compensation being made therefor, for certain public
improvements. As it is therein provided, 29 Stat. 356
"whenever, in the opinion of the President, the public
interests require the construction of railroads, or other
highways, telegraph or telephone lines, canals and irrigating ditches, through any portion of this reservation, right
of way shall be and is hereby granted for such purposes,
under such rules, regulations, limitations, and restrictions

as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe; the compensation to be fixed by said Secretary and by him expended for the benefit of the Indians."
While the plaintiffs in error were thus occupying the
lands under this agreement and statute, the Reclamation
Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, was passed.
That act outlines a comprehensive reclamation scheme,
and provides for the examination and survey of lands and
for construction and maintenance of irrigation works for
the storage, diversion, and development of water for the
reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands. Section VII of
that act provides (p. 389)"That where, in carrying out the provisions of this act,
it becomes necessary to acquire any rights or property,
the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to acquire the same for the United States by purchase or by
condemnation."
Section X of the same act provides"The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized
to perform any and all acts . . . necessary and
proper for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this
act . . . into effect."
In 1902, preliminary surveys for the Milk River Reclamation Project were begun by the Reclamation Service,
and the boundaries of the St. Mary Dam and its right of
way for flooding area were outlined. On February 28,
1903, the Secretary of the Interior, on recommendation of
the director of the service, withdrew, under the terms of
the Reclamation Act, a strip of land one-half mile wide
around lower St. Mary Lake and on each side of the river,
after which construction was authorized and a large
amount of work has since been done.
The authority of the Congress of the United States to
devote these lands to irrigation purposes is unquestioned.
As a matter of fact, it might, if it saw fit, remove the
Indians therefrom and devote the land to such uses.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

237 U. S.

Recognizing the injustice of arbitrary appropriations to
other uses, no effort has been made to take these lands
without compensation to the Indians for the improvements which they have made, and they have been given
the right to select other lands in place of those released.
The reclamation projects undertaken by the Government
are very extensive, and cover many States; and they must
involve in their construction, the flooding of lands in
connection with dams designed to hold water for such
purposes; and must necessarily include much territory
'which is included in Indian reservations. This situation
was of course well known to Congress when it passed the
Reclamation Act, and we cannot doubt, in view of the
broad authority conferred by §§ VII and X above quoted,
that it was the purpose of Congress to give the Secretary
of the Interior the right to acquire such rights as are here
involved, when necessary for reclamation purposes. In
carrying out the purposes of the act, the Secretary of the
Interior is authorized to acquire any rights or property
necessary for that purpose, and to acquire the same,
either by purchase or by cc ndemnation. He is specifically
authorized to perform any and all acts necessary and
proper for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the act. Authority could hardly have been conferred in more comprehensive terms, and we do not believe it was the intention of Congress, because of the
Indians' right of selection of lands under the circumstances
here shown, to reserve such lands from the operation of
the act. To do so might defeat the reclamation projects
which it was evidently the purpose of Congress to authorize and promote. The Secretary of the Interior, in interpreting this act, dealt fairly with the Indians in so far
as this record shows, paid them for the improvements
they had put upon the lands, and gave them the right to
select other lands which might be open to allotment, of
equal area, as provided by law, from the unoccupied lands

of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. In so doing, we
think- he acted within his authority, and was executing
the purposes intended by the act of Congress to which
we have referred.
The Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision laid emphasis upon the case of Williams v. First National Bank,
216 U. S. 582, in which this court recognized the right of
one Indian to surrender and relinquish to another Indian
a preference right to an allotment of a tract of land. In
that case it was held that one Indian might sell his improvements and holdings to another Indian for allotment,
and lay his own on other land which he might find vacant,
or which he might, in turn, purchase from another Indian,
and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that, this being
so, as a matter of course, and for stronger reasons, an Indian
might relinquish his rights to the United States, and that
restrictions had been placed upon the power of the Indians
to alienate their lands or convey their rights of possession
only for their protection, and not for the purpose of restricting their right to deal with the United States or to
relinquish their rights to the Government, citing Lykins
v. McGrath, 184 U. S. 169, and Jones v. Meehan, 175
U. S. 1. Without questioning the correctness of this
reasoning, we think the purpose of the United States to
acquire any property necessary for the reclamation project embraced such transactions A the Secretary had in
this case with the Indians, and the action which he took
under the author4ty conferred by that act wholly justified
all that was done in the premises.
As to the contention that the daughters for whom the
mother signed are not bound by the release: The mother
undertook to act for them as minors, and there is nothing
to indicate that they were not such, as there is no allegation in the answer to which the demurrer was sustained
that they were adults and therefore capable of acting for
themselves. The references to the regulations of the

237 U. S.

Interior Department, which are called to our attention
by the Government, show that that Department has uniformly required the interest of minors to be represented
by the natural guardian, which in this case was the mother.
There is no court to which they could have applied for the
judicial appointment of a guardian, and we see no reason
to question the legality of the practice of the Department
in this respect. A communication from the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs, attached to the Government's
brief, declares that that office and the Interior Department

have uniformly held that the natural guardian could
execute valid relinquishments in behalf of minor children,
and we see no reason why this authority should be questioned.
We reach the conclusion that the Court of Appeals did
not err in affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court,
and its judgment is accordingly
