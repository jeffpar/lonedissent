ST. LOUIS, IRON MOUNTAIN & SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. CRAFT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS.
No. 776.

Argued May 12, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.

In this case, as there was uncontradicted evidence that decedent survived his injuries, although only for something more than half an
hour, and that the injuries were such as to cause extreme pain if he
remained conscious, and there was conflicting evidence as to whether
he did remain conscious, those questions were properly submitted
to the jury; and the question for this court is not which way the
evidence preponderated but whether there was evidence from which
the jury could reasonably find that decedent did endure conscious
pain during the period between his injury and death.
While in this case, there was evidence to go to the jury on those questions, generally such pain and suffering as are substantially contemporaneous with death, or mere incidents to it, afford no estimation or award of damages under such. statutes as the Employers'
Liability Act.
By the common law the death of a human being, although wrongfully
caused, affords no basis for a recovery of damages, and a right
of action for personal injuries dies with the person injured; in
cases under the Employers' Liability Act, the right of recovery
depends entirely upon that statute, the state statutes being superseded thereby.
Under the Employers' Liability Act, as originally enacted in 1908,

Statement of the Case.

there was no prdvision for the survival of the right given to the
injured person and the right as at common law died with him;
but under the act as amended in 1910 that right of action survives
to the personal representatives of the decedent for the benefit of
the widow, husband, children, parents or dependent next of kin, as
specified in§ 9 of the act as amended.
A provision 'brought into a Federal statute by'way of amendment,
expressing the deliberate will of Congress, must be given effect; and,
construing §§ 1 and 9 of the Employers' Liability Act, "as amended,
together, the personal representative of a deceased employ6 is to
recover, on the part of the designated beneficiaries, not only such
damages as will compensate them for their own pecuniary loss, but
also such damages as will be reasonably compensatory for the loss
and suffering of decedent while he lived.
Such a recovery is not a double recovery for a single wrong, but a
single recovery for a double wrong.
Quwre whether under the final clause of § 9 of the Employers' Liability
Act, as amended in 1910, providing that there shall be only one recovery for one injury, the personal representative of a deceased
employ6 can recover where there has been a recovery by decedent
in his lifetime.
The provisions in § 9 of the Employers' Liability Act, as amended
in 1910, that there shall be only one recovery for one injury, does not
restrict the personal representative of a decedent who suffered pain
after the injury and before death to one basis of recovery to the exclusion of the other or require him to make a choice between them;
it does, however, limit him to one recovery of damages for both, and
thus avoid needless litigation in separate actions.
While reports of Committees of the different Houses of Congress in
regard to bills in their charge cannot be taken as giving to the act as
passed a meaning not fairly within its words, they may be persuasive
as showing that its words should not be wrongly construed.
The amount of a verdict for damages for suffering, although apparently
large, in this case $5,000 for pain endured during a period of thirty
minutes, involves only questions of fact and is not reviewable here
under § 237, Judicial Code. The power, and with it the duty and
responsibility, of dealing with such questions rests upon the courts
below.

Amendment of 1910 and the right of the administrator of
an employ6 killed by negligence of the employer to recover
not only for the death of, but also for the pain and suffering
endured by, decedent, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Troy Pace, with whom Mr. Edward J. White and
Mr. E. B. Kinsworthy were on the brief, for plaintiff in
error:
Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of 1908,
as amended April 5, 1910, plaintiff was not permitted to
recover both for pecuniary loss to next of kin and for
decedent's pain and suffering. Michigan Central Ry. v.
Vreeland, 227 U. S. 68.
In some of the statutes of the State there is a survival
act as well as a death act, and the latter is held to be
limited to cases of instantaneous or immediate death, and
cases where the death was not instantaneous or immediate
are held to fall under the survival statute. Sawyer v.
Perry, 88 Maine, 42; Anderson v. Wetter, 15 L. R. A.
(N. S.) 1003; Dolson v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry., 128
Michigan, 444; Belding v. Black Hills & Ft. P. R., 3 S. Dak.
369. See contra Sweetland v. Chi. & G. T. Ry., 117 Michigan, 329.
In a number of States it is held that the death acts
provide a complete remedy, whether the death is instantaneous or not, if the death results from the injury;
but if it results from some other cause, the survival act
provides the only remedy. Holton v. Daly, 106 Illinois, 131;
Chicago & E. I. Ry. v. O'Connor, 119 Illinois, 586; Lubrano
v. Atlantic Mills, 19 R. I. 129, 34 L. R. A. 797; McCarthy
Case, 18 Kansas, 46; Martin v. Missouri-Pac. Ry., 58
Kansas, 475; Hulbert v. Topeka, 34 Fed. Rep. 510.
In Kentucky it is held that an administrator, having a
right to sue for a decedent's pain and suffering or to sue
under the statute for his death, must elect which he will
do, and cannot do both. Conner v. Paul, 12 Bush, 144;

All of the cases hold there can only be one action for

For cases holding that, in case of a wrongful death, two
separate actions might be brought by the administrator,
one for the benefit of the estate and the other for the
benefit of the widow and next of kin, see Bowes v. Boston,
155 Massachusetts, 344; Davis v. Railway, 53 Arkansas,

The mere fact that there was evidence of some slight
spasmodic action on the part of the deceased, where the
other evidence tended to show that death was immediate,
has been held not sufficient to prevent the court from
directing a verdict for the plaintiff on the ground that the
death was instantaneous. Tiffany, Death by Wrongful

findings of fact of the state court are accepted as conclusive. Hedrick v. Atchison &c. Ry. Co., 167 U. S. 673;

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was an action under the Employers' Liability Act
of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, and the amendment
of April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, by an administrator
to recover for injuries to, and the death of, his intestate.
The action was for the benefit of the father, there being
no surviving widow, child or mother, and the damages
sought were for (a) pecuniary loss to the father by reason

237 U. S.

of the death and (b) conscious pain and suffering of the
decedent before the injuries proved fatal. In the trial
court the plaintiff had a verdict and judgment awarding
$1,000 for the pecuniary loss to the father and $11,000
for the pain and suffering of the decedent, and the Supreme Court of the State, after reducing the latter sum
to $5,000, affirmed the judgment. 171 S.W. Rep. 1185.
Without questioning that the evidence justified an
assessment of damages for the father's pecuniary loss, the
defendant insists, as it did in both state courts, that the
recovery could not include anything for pain and suffering
of the decedent, first, because there was no evidence that
he endured any conscious pain or suffering, and, second,
because the statute requires that the recovery in such
cases be restricted to either the pecuniary loss to the
designated beneficiaries or the damage sustained by the
injured person while he lived, and does not permit a
recovery for both.
The first objection must, as we think, be overruled.
The record discloses that the decedent survived his injuries more than a half hour and that they were such as
were calculated to cause him extreme pain and suffering, if
he remained conscious. A car passed partly over his body,
breaking some-of the bones, lacerating the flesh and opening the abdomen, and then held him fast under the wheels
with a brake rod pressing his face to the ground. It took
fifteen minutes to lift the car and release his body and
fifteen minutes more to start him to the hospital in an
ambulance. It was after this that he died, the time not
being more definitely stated. As to whether he was conscious and capable of suffering pain the evidence was
conflicting. Some of the witnesses testified that he was
"groaning every once in a while" and that when they
were endeavoring to pull him from under the car "he
would raise his arm" and "try to pull himself," while
others testified that they did not notice these indications

ST. LOUIS & IRON MTN. RY. v. CRAFT.

655

Opinion of the Court.

of consciousness and that he seemed to be unconscious
from the beginning. The jury found that he was conscious and both state courts accepted that solution of the
dispute. Of course, the question here is not which way
the evidence preponderated, but whether there was
evidence from which the jury reasonably could find that
while he lived he endured conscious pain and suffering as
a result of his injuries. That question, we are persuaded,
must be answered in the affirmative. But to ayoid any
misapprehension it is well to observe that the case is
close to the border line, for such pain and sufiering as are
substantially contemporaneous with death or mere incidents to it, as also the short periods of insensibility which
sometimes intervene between fatal injuries and death,
afford no basis for a separate estimation or award of damages under statutes like that which is controlling here.

By the common law the death of a human being, although wrongfully caused, affords no basis for a recovery
of damages, and a right of action for personal injuries
dies with the person injured. Insurance Co. v. Brame,

Martin v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., 151 U. S. 673, 697; Michigan
Central R. R. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 67-68. Therefore
in cases like this the right of recovery depends entirely
upon statute law. Here the state statute is not applicable
because superseded, as respects the class of cases to which
this one belongs, by the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

237 U. S.

&c. Ry. v. Seale, 229 U. S. 156, 158; Taylor v. Taylor,
232 U. S. 363. So, it is by that act that we must test the
objection that the recovery could not include damages for
the decedent's conscious. pain and suffering along with
damages for the father's pecuniary loss.
The original act was adopted by Congress April 22,
1908. In its first section it provides for two distinct
rights of action based upon altogether different principles,
although primarily resting upon the same wrongful act or
neglect. It invests the injured employ6 with a right to
such damages as will compensate him for his personal loss
and suffering-a right which arises only where his injuries
are not immediately fatal. And where his injuries prove
fatal, either immediately or subsequefitly (Michigan
Central R. R. v. Vreeland, supra, p. 68; Louisville & St.
Louis R.. R. v. Clarke, 152 U. S. 230, 238), it invests his
personal representative, as a trustee for designated relatives, with a right to such damages as will compensate
the latter for any pecuniary loss which they sustain by
the death. At first there was. no provision for a survival
of the right given to the injured person, and so under the
operation of the rule of the common law it would die with
him.
Of the right given to the personal representative we
said in the Vreeland Case, p. 68: "This cause of action is
independent of any cause of action which the decedent
had, and includes no damages which he might have recovered for his injury if he had survived. It is one beyond
that which the decedent had,-on6 proceeding upon
altogether different principles. It is a liability for the loss
and damage sustained by relatives dependent upon the
decedent. It is therefore a liability for the pecuniary
damage resulting to them and for that only." And in
American R. R. v. Didricksen, 227 U. S. 145, 149, we said,
referring to the original act: "The cause of action which
was created in behalf of -the injured employ6 did not sur-

ST. LOUIS & IRON MTN. RY. v. CRAFT.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

vive his death, nor pass to his representatives. But the
act, in case of the death of such an employ6 from his injury, creates a new and distinct right of action for the
benefit of the dependent relatives named in the statute.
The damages recoverable are limited to such loss as results
to them because they have been deprived of a reasonable
expectation of pecuniary benefits by the wrongful death
of the injured employ6. The damage is limited strictly
to the financial loss thus sustained."
If the matter turned upon the original act alone it -is
plain that the recovery here could not include damages for
the decedent's pain and suffering, for only through a
provision for a survival of his right could such damages be
recovered after his death. But the original act is not
alone to be considered. On April 5, 1910, prior to the
decedent's injuries the act was "amended by adding the
following section:"
"SEc. 9. That any right of action given by this Act to a
person suffering injury shall survive to his or her personal
representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or
husband and children of such employ6, and, if none, then
of such employ6's parents; and, if none, then of the next of
kin dependent upon such employ6, but in such cases there
shall be only one recovery for the same injury."
No change was made in § 1. Taylor v. Taylor, 232 U. S.
363, 370. It continues, as before, to provide for two
distinct rights of action: one in the injured person for his
personal loss and suffering where the injuries are not
immediately fatal, and the other in his personal representative for the pecuniary loss sustained by designated relatives where the injuries immediately or ultimately result
in death. Without abrogating or curtailing either right,
the new section provides in exact words that the right
given to the injured person "shall survive" to his personal
representative "for the benefit of" the same relatives in
whose behalf the other right is given. Brought into the
VoL. ccxxxvii-42

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

237 U. S.

act by way of amendment, this provision expresses the
deliberate will of Congress. Its terms are direct, evidently
carefully chosen, and should be given effect accordingly.
It does not mean that the injured person's right shall survive to his personal Tepresentative and yet be unenforceable by the latter, or that the survival shall be for the
benefit of the designated relatives and yet be of no avail
to them. On the contrary, it means that the right existing
in the injured person at his death-a right covering his
loss and suffering while he lived but taking no account
of his premature death or of what he would have earned or
accomplished in the natural span of life-shall survive to
his personal representative to the end that it may be
enforced and the proceeds paid to the relatives indicated.
And when this provision, and § 1 are read together the.
conclusion is unavoidable that the personal representative
is to recover on behalf of the designated beneficiaries, not
only such damages as will compensate them for their own
pecuniary loss, but also such damages as will be reasonably
compensatory for the' loss and suffering of the injured
person while he lived. Although originating in the same
wrongful act or neglect, the two claims are quite distinct,
no part of either being embraced in the other. One is for
the wrong to the injured person and is confined to his
personal loss and sufferi: ig before he died, while the other is
for the wrong to the be ieficiaries and is confined to their
pecuniary loss through his death. .One begins where the
other ends, and a recovery upon both in the same action is
not a double recovery for a single wrong but a single
recovery for a double wrong. Davis v. Railway, 53
Arkansas, 117; Commonwealth v. Metropolitan R. R., 107
Massachusetts, 236; Bowes v. Boston, 155 Massachusetts,

Opinion of the Court.

Eichorn v. New Orleans &c. Power Co., 112 Louisiana, 235;
Vicksburg & Meridian R. R. v. Phillips, 64 Mississippi,
693.
Much stress is laid upon the concluding clause in the
new section, "but in such cases there shall be only one
recovery for the same injury." Passing and reserving the
question of its application where there has been a recovery
by the decedent in his lifetime (see Michigan Central R. R.
v. Vreeland, supra, p. 70), we think this clause, as applied
to cases like the present, is not intended to restrict the
personal representative to one right to the exclusion of the
other, or to require that he make a choice between them,
but to limit him to one recovery of damages for both, and
so to avoid the needless litigation in separate actions of
what would better be settled once for all in a single action.
This view gives full effect to every word in the clause and
ascribes to it a reasonable purpose without bringing it
into conflict with other provisions the terms of which are
plain and unequivocal. Had Congress intended that the
personal representative should make an election between
the two rights of action and sue upon one only, it is not
easy to believe that it would have chosen the words in this
clause to express that intention.
In Nor. Pac. Ry. v. Maerkl, 198 Fed. Rep. 1, an injured
employ6 brought an action under the statute to recover
for his injuries and shortly thereafter died by reason of
them. The action was revived in the name of his personal
representative and by an amended and supplemental
petition damages were sought for the suffering of the
deceased while he lived and also for the pecuniary loss to
his widow and children by his death. Over an objection
that there should be an election between the two rights of
action, the plaintiff secured. a verdict and judgment assessing the total damages at $9,576.80, being $936.80 on the
first right of action and $8,640.0C n the second. The
recovery was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

237 U.'S.

for the Ninth Circuit, the court saying that "the plain
meaning" of the new section is that damages for the
deceased's personal loss and suffering and for the pecuniary
loss to the designated beneficiaries by the death, "not
only may be recovered by the personal representative of
the deceased in one action, but must be recovered in one
action only, if at all." So far as we are advised by the
reported decisions, this is the view which has been taken
by all the courts, Federal and state, that have had occasion to consider the question.
A brief reference to *the particular circumstances in
which the new section was adopted will show that they
give material support to the conclusion to which we come
after considering its terms.
The original act, as we have said, made no provision for
the -,urvival of the right of action given to the injured
person, although such a provision existed in the statutes of
many of the States. Shortly after the act two cases arose
thereunder in each of which the personal representative of
an injured employ6, who died from his injuries, sought to
recover damages for the employ6's personal loss and
suffering while he lived as well as for the pecuniary loss
to the beneficiaries named in the act. In both cases-one
in the Circuit Court for the Western District of Arkansas
and the other in the Circuit Court for the District of
Massachusetts-the right of the injured employ6 would
have survived if the local statutes were applicable, and the
ruling in both was that the Federal act was exclusive and
superseded the local statutes, that it made ho provision for
a survival, and therefore that the recovery should be
confined to damages for the pecuniary loss resulting to
the designated beneficiaries from the death. Fulgham v.
Midland Valley R. R., 167 Fed. Rep. 660; Walsh v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. R., 173 Fed. Rep. 494. Following
these decisions the amendment embodying the new section
was proposed in Congress. In reporting upon it the

Opinion of the Court.

Committees on the Judiciary in the Senate and House of
Representatives referred at length to the opinions delivered in the two cases, to the absence from the original
act of a provision for a survival of the employ6's right of
action and to the presence of such a provision in the
statutes of many of the. States, and then recommended the
adoption of the amendment, saying that tl~e act should be
made "as broad, as cofhprehensive, and as inclusive in its
terms as any of the similar remedial statutes existing in
any of the States, which are suspended in their operation by
force of the Federal legislation upon the subject." Senate

Report No. 513, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 3-6. While
these reports cannot be taken as giving to the new section
a meaning not fairly within its words, they persuasively
show that it should not be.narrowly or restrictively interpreted.
For these reasons we think the second objection is not
tenable.
Finally, it is said that the award of $5,000 as damages for
pain and suffering, even though extreme, for so short a
period as approximately thirty minutes is excessive. The
award does seem large, but the power, and with it the duty
and responsibility, of dealing with this matter rested upon
the courts below. It involves only a question of fact and
is not open to reconsideration here. Railroad Co. v.
Fraloff, 100 U. S. 24, 31; The Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall.
274; Erie R. R. v. Winter, 143 U. S. 60, 75; Herencia v.
Guzman, 219 U. S. 44; Southern Railway v. Bennett, 233
U. S. 80.
Judgment affirmed.
