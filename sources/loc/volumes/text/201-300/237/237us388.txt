EXPORT AND IMPORT LUMBER COMPANY v.
PORT BANGA LUMBER COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS.

No. 686.

Argued March 15, 1915.-Decided April 26, 1915.

Where the jurisdiction of this court depends on the amount involved,
the appeal must be dismissed unless the record fairly shows that
the value in controversy exceeds the amount fixed by statute, the
criterion being that which is actually in dispute.
Where defendant appeals from a judgment against it and plaintiff does
not appeal although its prayer was for a larger amount, the amount
in controversy is the amount of such judgment and the total amount
of appellant's claim against plaintiff, and unless they aggregate the
statutory amount there is no jurisdiction.
Under the Act of July 1, 1902, ยง 10, c. 1369, 32 Stat. 691, 695, this
court has no jurisdiction of an appeal from the Supreme Court of
the Philippine Islands unless the amount in controversy exceeds
$25,000, and as that amount is not shown to be in controversy in
this case the appeal is dismissed.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court
of appeals from the Supreme Court of the Philippine
Islands, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Clement L. Bouve and Mr. James Ross for defendant
in error in support of the motion.
Mr. A. D. Gibbs for plaintiff in error in opposition to the
motion.

pends on the amount involved; and a motion to dismiss
must be sustained unless from a consideration of the whole
record it fairly appears that "the value in controversy
exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars." Act of July 1,
1902, ยง 10, c. 1369; 32 Stat. 691, 695. What is actually in
dispute here is the criterion. Bowman v. Chicago &

To avoid possible confusion their United States currency equivalents are used herein instead of the Philippine
peso and centavo.
The Port Banga Lumber Company instituted a proceeding November 14, 1910, and afterwards filed an
amended complaint, against appellant, the Export and
Import Lumber Company, wherein it alleged that in
March or April, 1910, the two companies entered into an
oral arrangement to sell logs in the China trade upon joint
account-the proceeds to be appropriated first to expenses
and then equally divided; appellant on May 6, 1910, agreed
to furnish to the China Import and Export Lumber Company logs at ninety cents per cubic foot; thereafter falsely
pretending such stipulated price was twenty-seven and
one-half cents appellant induced complainant to consent
to an annulment of the oral arrangement between them
and enter into a written one dated June 10, 1910, under
which the latter agreed to supply the logs for twenty cents
per cubic foot; and that at an expense of $7,211.43 it delivered 32,032 cubic feet and appellant collected therefor
ninety cents per foot-28,828.80. The complainant accordingly asked that the writing of June 10th be annulled;
the oral contract be declared in force; and in harmony
therewith judgment for $18,020.12.
The Export and Import Lumber Company denied the
allegations in the complaint, except as specifically admitted, but said the written contract of June 10th was in

force and $2500.00 had been paid thereunder and accepted
by complainant. It further set up that by the contract of
May 6th it became obligated to furnish the China Import
and Export Lumber Company designated logs within a
specified time; on June 10th it transferred this duty to the
complainant which failed fully to comply therewith; and
as a consequence $8,750.00 had to be deducted from the
sale price which otherwise would have been received.. It
therefore claimed damages to that extent and asked judgment accordingly.
Counsel admitted of record that 32,032 cubic feet of logs
were delivered by complainant to the China Import and Export Lumber Company; and unquestionably appellant collected therefor 90 cents per foot, $28,828.80, less $8,750.00.
The court below held (26 Phil. Rep. 602; 27 Phil. Rep.
*) the contract of June 10th was procured by fraud; the
rights of the parties depended upon .ie oral agreement;
the deduction of $8,750.00 from stipulated sale price should
be taken into consideration; complainant was entitled to
its expenses of $7,211.43; andthat the balance of amount
actually collected by appellant should be equally divided.
A certain credit of $450.00, explanation of which is now
unnecessary, having been allowed, judgment was entered
April 3, 1914, against appellant for $13,195.12, together
with $2,683.01 interest from November 14, 1910, when the
original complaint was filed-in all $15,878.13. The Port
Banga L4umber Company has not appealed and this is the
maximum recovery which appellant can suffer.
According to appellant's theory the written contract of
June 10th remained in force. A settlement thereunder
would require a debit against it for logs delivered-32,032
cubic feet at twenty cents-of $6,406.40, and necessitate
credits of $2,500.00, alleged payment on account, and
$8,750.00, damages sustained. The resulting balance of
$4,843.60, with interest from November 14, 1910, to

Syllabus.

April 3, 1914, $984.87, or $5,828.47, is the greatest sum for
which it could have recovered judgment.
The maximum amount fairly in dispute is therefore the
judgment of $15,878.13 against appellant, plus $5,828.47
which it sought to recover from appellee-a total of
$21,706.60. Dushane v. Benedict, 120 U. S. 630, 636; Buckstaff v. Russell, 151 U. S. 626, 628; Harten v. L.ffler, 212

The value in controversy being under $25,000.00, the
appeal must be
Dismissed.

BOOTH v. STATE OF INDIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.

No. 231.

Argued April 19, 1915.-Decided May 3, 1915.

As the police power of the State extends'to regulating coal mining, it
cannot be limited by moments of time and differences of situation.
Where the highest court of the State has sustained a police statute under the State Constitution, this court is only concerned with questions of constitutionality under the Federal Constitution.
The Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States.
The decision of the highest court of the state that the method of calling
a police statute into operation is proper does not involve a Federal
question reviewable by this court.
A police statute requiring owners of the mine to furnish certain conveniences for coal miners on request of a specified number of employ6s is not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the
law because it may be applied to one mine where some of the
employ6s demand it, and not to another where such demand is not
made by the specified number. McLean v. Arkansas, 211 U. S.
539.
