SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 331.

Argued January 13, 1915.-Decided March 22, 1915.

Under Par. 20, of § 24, of the Judicial Code, the Court of Claims has
jurisdiction of a'suit against the United States for refund of money
paid for documentary stamps affixed to charter parties under § 25 of
the War Revenue Act of 1898 and the District Court of the proper
District has concurrent jurisdiction of claims of that nature not exceeding ten thousand dollars.
Under the various refunding statutes, culminating in the act of July 27,
1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240, such claims are founded upon a law of Congress within the meaning of the Tucker Act as now incorporated in
the Judicial Code.
Although the pendency of one class of claims may have induced the
passage of an act of Congress. providing for their adjustment, the
act may embrace other claims if its terms are sufficiently wide so to
do.
While under § 297, of the Judicial Code, § 5 of the Tucker Act was
saved from repeal and the District Court having jurisdiction of a
claim against the United States is the one of the District in which the
plaintiff resides, that requirement may be waived; and if no specific
objection is taken before pleading to the merits, it will be deemed to
have been waived, and if the District Court otherwise has jurisdiction, the case may proceed.

ing documentary stamps was hot essential to recovery. Right to
repayment exists if the record shows that the sums sought to be
recovered were not legally payable and the claim was duly presented
within the time prescribed.
The constitutional freedom from taxation on imports assured by § 9,
Art. I, of the Federal Constitution, means more than mere exemption from taxes specifically laid upon the goods themselves. It
means that'the process of exportation shall not be obstructed by any
burden of taxation.
Where a charter party is practically a bill of lading for the entire cargo
of the vessel,,and is essential to the business of exportation in shipload lots, a tax on the charter party is, in substance, a tax on exportation and, as such, a tax on the exports, and, if on charter parties of
vessels exclusively for foreign ports, is invalid under § 9, Art. I, of the
Federal Constitution.
There is a distinction between tonnage taxes, as laid by the Federal
Government, and export taxes, and the fact that Congress has power
to lay a tonnage tax on entry does not authorize it to lay taxes on
exportation which practically amount to taxes on the exports
themselves.

TmlE facts are stated in the opinion.
The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Theodor Megaardenwas on the brief, for the United States:
The District Court was without jurisdiction of the action.
The claim of the petitioners was presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and by him rejected. The
remedy of petitioners was therefore an action against the
Collector of Internal Revenue and not against the United
States. Edison Electric Co. v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 208;
Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, 129; Sybrandt v.
United States, 19 Ct. Cl. 461; UnitedStates v. Kaufman, 96
U. S.567; United States v. Savings Bank, 104 U. S. 728, 734.

This established rule is not altered by the act of July 27,
1912, 37 Stat. 240, upon which petitioners rely. The sole
object of this act was simply the extension of time to
*January 1,1914, for the filing of belated claims.

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
237 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

It does not affirmatively appear that the suit was brought
in the district in which the petitioners reside.
The Tucker Act (under which this suit was brought)
declares that it must be brought in the district where the
plaintiff resides; and this provision as to venue is mandatory. Reid Wrecking Co. v. United States, 202 Fed.
Rep. 314, 316.
The petition fails to state a cause of action.
There can be no recovery in the absence of any showing
that the taxes were paid under protest. Chesebrough v.
United States, 192 U. S. 253; United States v. N. Y. & Cuba
Mail S. S. Co., 200 U. S. 488.
And to "require" the payment of stamps upon charter
parties on the part of the Treasury Department does not
constitute duress, or make payment under protest unnecessary to a recovery. United States v. Edmondston, 181
U. S. 500.
The act of July 27, 1912, does not dispense with protest or duress as a condition precedent to a recovery.
Chesebrough and N. Y. & Cuba Mail S. S. Co. Cases, supra.
The petition does not show that the claim for refunding
was presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
within the statutory time.
The tax which was imposed upon charter parties was
not unconstitutional.
The tax was not unconstitutional merely because it
may have been measured by the cargo space of vessels
employed in some instances in the export trade.
The tax in question was measured by the tonnage of
the vessels: chartered, and tonnage taxes may lawfully
be imposed by Congress. State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12
Wall. 204, 216.
And a duty on tonnage may be imposed with a view
to revenue, as well as with a view to the regulation of
commerce. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202; State
Tonnage Tax Cases, supra..

The tax only incidentally and remotely affected articles exported.
The tax was not a tax on articles exported and the act
imposing it does not come within the constitutional prohibition of a tax or duty on such articles. Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U. S. 56, 79; C., B. & Q. Ry.
v. United States, 209 U. S. 90.
The most that can be claimed is that the taxes were
paid on goods intended for exportation; and goods intended
for exportation are not exports. Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S.

Mr. Everett P. Wheeler, with whom Mr. Simon Lyon and
Mr. R. B. H. Lyon were on the brief, for defendants in
error:
Jurisdiction of this cause was conferred upon the
District Court of the United States by Judicial Code,
March 3, 1911, § 24, subd. 20, by which the United'States
submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the District Court.
The twentieth clause was a reenactment with some
extension as to amount of the act of March 3, 1887,
24 Stat. 505.
This jurisdiction is similar to that conferred upon the
Court of Claims by § 145, Jud. Code.
The act of July 27, 1912, pleaded in the petition is
broad, and the history of its enactment on this subject
shows plainly that the act in question is not to be limited

One of the limitations upon the taxing power of Congress is that no tax or duty shall be laid on any articles
exported from any State.
The presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of a
statute but this presumption is less strong in favor of a
statute imposing taxes in a multitude of ways, and upon a
multitude of objects.

A tax on charter parties is unconstitutiodal, and differs
in no respect from the stamp tax on export bills of lading or
on manifests, both 'of which have been held unconstitutional. A tax upon it is as clearly a tax upon exports as was'
the tax in the other cases referred to. To tax either is
clearly to tax the goods which they enable to be exported.
See Fairbank Case, supra.
It is essential to the export business as it is universally
used in cases of full cargo lots, and the courts treat it as
one of the documents essential to such transactions.
Ireland v. Livingston, L. R. 5 H. L. 395, 406; Tamvaco v.
Lucas, 1 Best & Smith, 185, 197. Under the FairbankCase
an export document, to be protected against taxation, need
not be a document absolutely necessary to the carrying on
of the business. The charter party, is a commercially
necessary document, in view of the way in which business
is actually done, and that being so, it is directly covered
by the decision in the Fairbank Case.

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
37 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to review a judgment of the
District Court awarding a recovery against the United
States for the amount paid as stamp taxes upon certain
charter parties under § 25 of the War Revenue Act of
June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 460. These charter
parties were exclusively for the carriage of cargo from
ports in the States of the United States to foreign ports and
the imposition of the taxes was held to be in violation of
§ 9, Article I, of the Constitution of the United States,
which provides: "No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles
exported from any State."
The suit was brought under paragraph 20 of § 24 of the
Judicial Code Which confers jurisdiction, concurrent with
the Court of Claims, upon the District Court 'of all
claims not exceeding ten thousand dollars founded upon
the Constitution of the United States or any law of
Congress' (see act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, § 1, 24 Stat.
505); and the claim of the plaintiffs (defendants in error)
was based upon the act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat.
240, which is as follows:
"That all claims for the refunding of any internal tax
alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or
collected under the provisions of section twenty-nine of the
Act of Congress approved June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety eight, known as the War-Revenue Tax,
or of any sums alleged to have been excessive, or in any
manner wrongfully collected under the provisions of said
Act may be presented to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue on or before the first day of January, nineteen
hundred and fourteen, and not thereafter.
"SEc. 2. That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby
authorized and directed to pay, out of any moneys of the
United States not otherwise appropriated, to such claimants as have presented or shall hereafter so present their

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

237 U. S.

claims, and shall establish such erroneous or illegal assessment and collection, any sums paid by them or on their
account or in their interest to the United States under the
provisions of the Act aforesaid."
The Government demurred to the petition upon the
grounds that the court had no jurisdiction of the defendant, or of the subject of the action, and that the petition
did not state facts sufficient to the action, and that the
petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. The demurrer was overruled (217 Fed' Rep.
680) and, after answer, the case was heard on the merits.
*The court found in substance that the firm, of which the
defendants in error were the surviving members, had paid
without protest certain stamp taxes on charter parties of
the character described; that, on filing their claim under
the act of 1912 it had been certified by the collector to be
correct in its statement of facts, but that the Commissioner
.of Internal Revenue had rejected it for the reason .that the
act was not applicable. Holding the taxes to be unconstitutional, and the claim to have been duly presented, the
court rendered judginent for the claimants.
The Government contends that the court erred in
deciding (1) that the court had jurisdiction of the case,
(2) that it need not be averred or proved that the tax iwas
paid under protest, and (3) that the tax was invalid.
The first contention-with respect to jurisdiction-is
that, the claim having been rejected, the remedy of the
claimants was an action against the Collector of Internal
Revenue and not against the United States. The course
of the pertinent legislation since the passage of the War
Revenue Act of 1898 may be briefly reviewed: In 1900,
Congress provided for the redemption of, or allowance for,
internal revenue stamps, including cases where 'the rates
or duties represented thereby' had been 'excessive in
amount, paid in error, or in any manner wrongfully collected.' Act of May 12, 1900, c. 393, 31 Stat. 177. In

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

1902, various provisions of thp War Revenue Act, and
amendments thereof, including §§ 6, 12, 25, schedules
A and B, with regard to stamp taxes, and § 29 as to taxes
on legacies and distributive shares, were repealed. Act of
April 12, 1902, c. 500, 32 Stat. 96, 97. The repealing act
was to take effect on July 1, 1902, and shortly before that
date Congress made specific provision that certain taxes
collected under the repealed statute should be refunded.
Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160, 32 Stat. 406. These taxes
were (1) those that had been paid upon bequests for uses of
a religious, literary, charitable, or educational character,
etc.; (2) the 'sums paid for documentary stamps used on
export bills of lading, such stamps representing taxes which
were illegally assessed and collected'; and (3) taxes theretofore or thereafter paid upon legacies or distributive
shares to the extent that they were collected 'on contingent
beneficial interests' which had not become vested prior to
July 1, 1902. It was also provided that no tax should
thereafter be assessed under the act in respect of any such
interest which had not become 'absolutely vested in
possession or enjoyment' prior to the date mentioned.
The act of 1902 was followed by other refunding statutes. In United States v. New York & Cuba Mail S. S.
CO., 200 U. S. 488, suit had been brought in the District
Court to recover taxes which had been paid under the
War Revenue Act upon manifests of cargoes bound to
foreign ports, and it was held (following Chesebrough v.
United States, 192 U. S. 253) that no recovery could be
had because the payment had been voluntarily made; the
jurisdiction of the court was not impugned. Thereupon
Congress provided for the refundifig of sums paid for
stamps "on export ships' manifests" representing taxes
'which were illegally assessed and collected,'--' said refund to be made whether said stamp taxes were paid under
protest or not, and without being subject to any statute of
limitations.' Act of March 4, 1907, c. 2919, 34 Stat. 1371,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914,
Opinion of the Court.

237 1. S.

1373. Again, in 1909, the Secretary of the Treasury was
directed to pay to those who had duly presented their
claims prior to July 1, 1904, the sums paid for stamps
used 'on foreign bills of exchange' (drawn between July 1,
1898, and June 30, 1901) 'against the value of products or
merchandise actually exported to foreign countries, such
stamps representing taxes which were illegally assessed
and collected, said refund to be made whether said stamp
taxes were paid under pr6test or duress or not.' Act of
February 1, 1909, c. 53, 35 Stat. 590; see also acts of
August 5, 1909, c. 7, 36 Stat. 118, 120; June 25, 1910,
c. 385, 36 Stat. 774, 779; August 26, 1912, c. 408, 37 Stat.
.595, 626.
It thus appears that the act of 1912-upon which the
present claim is based-was the culmination of a series of
statutes which leave no question as to the intention of
Congress to create an obligation on the part of the United
States in favor of those holding the described claims, and
it follows that these claims must be deemed to be founded
upon a 'law of Congress' within the meaning of the provisions of the Tucker 'Act, now incorporated in the Judicial
Code. See Medbury-v. United States, 173 U. S. 492, 497;
McLean v. United States, 226 U. S. 374, 378. With respect to the refunding of taxes paid on the 'contingent
interests' described in the act of June 27, 1902, supra, it
has been held that upon the rejection of the claim an action lies against the United States in the Court of Claims,
or in the District Court (where the amount is within the
prescribed limit). Fidelity Trust Co. v. United States, 45
Ct. Cl. 362; S. C., 222 U. S. 158; United States v. Jones,
236 U. S. 106; Thacher v. United States, 149 Fed. Rep.
902; United States v. Shipley, 197 Fed. Rep. 265. And
this is true not only where such taxes were paid before the
refunding act was passed but also where subsequently they
were wrongfully collected in violation of its provisions.
United States v. Jones, supra. The same rule must obtain

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
37 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

as to all claims described in the act of 1912, and in this
view we are not concerned in the present case with questions arising under the general provisions of the internal
revenue laws.
It is urged by the Government that Congress intended
to limit the act of 1912 to the refunding of death duties
erroneously or illegally assessed under § 29 of the War
RevenueAct. Reference is made to the legislative history
of the statute, but the contention lacks adequate support.
(See House Reports, 62d Cong. 2d Sess., Report No. 848,
June 6, 1912.) While the pendency of claims for the refunding of such taxes may -have induced the passage of
the act its terms were not confined to these. On the contrary, after providing for the claims arising under § 29;
Congress added the further clause making express provision for the presentation of claims for the refunding 'of
any sums alleged to have been excessive, or in any manner
wrongfully collected under the provisions of said Act';
and the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to pay to
those who duly present their claims and establish
the erroneous or illegal collection 'any sums paid by
them . . . to the United States under the provisions
of the Act aforesaid.' We are not at liberty to read these
explicit clauses out of the statute.
Another objection to the jurisdiction of the District
Court is that under § 5 of the Tucker Act (a provision
which was saved from repeal by § 297 ofthe Judicial Code)
;the suit was to be brought 'in the district where the plaintiff resides.' 24 Stat. 506. The petition alleged that petitioners were the surviving members of a copartnership
engaged in business in the City of New York 'within the
district aforesaid' and that their 'business and partnership
residence was and is in the Borough of Manhattan, City of
New York, in said district.' It is said that the allegation
was insufficient to show the residence required by the
statute, but it does not appear that any such objection was

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

237 U. S.

made in the court below. The general language of the demurrer with respect to jurisdiction had appropriate reference to the general authority of the court to entertain
such a suit against the United States and to the jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action. But assuming
that the subject-matter was within the jurisdiction of the
court the requirement as to the particular district within
which the suit should be brought was but a modal and
formal one which could be waived, and must be deemed to
be waived in the absence of specific objection upon this
ground before pleading to the merits. St. Louis &c. Ry.
v. McBride, 141 U. S. 127, 131; Central Trust Co. v. McGeorge, 151 U. S. 129, 133; Martin v. Balt. & Ohio R. R.,
151 U. S. 673, 688; Interior Construction Co. v. Gibney, 160
U. S. 217, 220; Western Loan Co. v. Butte & Boston Mining
Co., 210 U. S. 368; Arizona & New Mexico Ry. v. Clark,
235 U. S. 669, 674.
It is also apparent, in the light of the manifest purpose
and scope of the legislation to which we have referred, that
the contention' based upon the absence of protest cannot
be sustained. Where taxes have been illegally assessed
upon the 'contingent interests' described in the refunding
act of 1902 it has been held that recovery may be had although the taxes were paid without protest. United States
v. Jones, supra. In the acts of 1907 and 1909, supra,
with respect to stamp taxes on "export ships' -manifests"
and on foreign bills of exchange against exports, Congress
expressly provided for refunding whether the taxes had
been paid under protest or not. The fact that these express
words were not repeated in the act of 1912 cannot, in view
of the nature of the subject, be regarded as evidending a
different intent; rather must this act receive in this respect the same construction as that which has been given
to the act of 1902. If it appeared that the sums sought
to be recovered were not legally payable, and the claim
was duly presented within the time fixed, the right to

UNITED STATES v. HVOSLEF.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

repayment was established by the express terms of the
statute.
The question, then, is whether the tax, so far as it was
laid upon charter parties which were exclusively for the
carriage of cargo from state ports -to foreign ports, was
a valid one. The constitutional provision that 'no tax or
duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State'
has been the subject of elaborate and authoritative exposition and we need but to apply the principles of construqtion which have been settled by previous decisions.
The prohibition relates only to exportation to foreign
countries (Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123; Dooley v.
United States, 183 U. S. 151, 154, 162), and is designed to
give immunity from taxation to property that is in the
actual course of such exportation (Pace v. Burgess, 92,
U. S. 372; Turpin v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 504; Cornell v.
Coyne, 192 U. S. 418). This constitutional freedom, however, plainly involves more than mere exemption from
taxes or duties which are laid specifically upon the goods
themselves. If it meant no more than that, the obstructions to exportation which it was the purpose to prevent
could readily be set up by legislation nominally conforming
to the constitutional restriction but in effect overriding it.
It was the clear intent of the framers of the Constitution
that 'the process of exporting the products of a State,
the goods, chattels, and property of the people of the
several States, should not be obstructed or hindered by
any burden of taxation.' Miller on the Constitution,
p. 592. It was with this view that Chief Justice Marshall
in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419,-holding that a
state tax on the occupation of the importer was a tax on
imports and that the mode of imposing it merely varied
the form without varying the substance-drew the comparison between the two prohibitions: "The States are
forbidden to lay a duty on exports, and the United States
are forbidden to lay a tax or duty on articles exported

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the. Court.

237 U. S.

from any State. There is some diversity in language, but
none is perceivable in the act which is prohibited. The
United States have the same right to tax occupations
which is possessed by the States. Now, suppose the
United States should require every exporter to take out a
license, for which he should pay such tax as Congress
might think proper to impose; would the Government be
permitted to shield itself from the just censure to which
this attempt to evade the prohibitions of the constitution
would expose it, by saying, that this was a tax on the person, not on the article, and that the legislature had a right
to tax occupations?" Id., pp. 444, 445. And in Almy v.
California,24 How. 169, applying the same principle, the
court said by Chief Justice Taney that 'a tax or duty on a
bill of lading, although differing in form from a duty on the
article shipped' was 'in substance the same thing,' for 'a
bill, of lading, or some written instrument of the same
import,' was 'necessarily always associated with every
shipment of articles of commerce from the ports of one
country to those of another.' There, as was pointed out
in Woodruff v. Parham,supra, shipments to foreign ports
were not in fact involved, but this did not detract from
the force of the statement so far as it concerns the effect of
the tax described.
In Fairbankv. United States, 181 U. S. 283, the question
of Federal taxation of export bills of lading was directly
involved, and after great consideration was definitely determined. In that case, there had been a conviction under
the War Revenue Act of 1898. It was the contention of
the Government that no tax was placed upon the article
exported; that so far as the question was as to what might
be exported, and how it should be exported, the statute
imposed no restriction; that the full scope of the legislation was to impose a stamp duty on a document not necessarily, though ordinarily, used in connection with the exportation of goods; that it was a mere 'stamp imposition

on an instrument' and similar to many such taxes which
are imposed by Congress by virtue of its general power of
taxation, not upon these alone, but upon a great variety
of instruments used in the ordinary transactions of business. These arguments were not convincing. The court
held that 'the requirement of the Constitution is that exports should be free from any governmental burden.'
The language is 'no tax or duty.' 'We know historically,'
said the court, 'that it was one of the compromises which
entered into and made possible the adoption of the Constitution. It is a restriction on the power of Congress;
and as in accordance with the rules heretofore noticed the
grants of powers should be so construed as to give full
efficacy to those powers and enable Congress to use such
means as it deems necessary to carry them into effect, so
in like manner a restriction should be enforced in accordance with its letter and spirit, and no legislation can be
tolerated which, although it may not conflict with the
letter, destroys the spirit and purpose of the restriction
,imposed.' In answer to the contention that the sole purpose of the prohibition was to prevent discrimination between the States, and that there should be enforcement
only so far as necessary to prevent such discrimination, the
court said: 'If mere discrimination between the States
was all that was contemplated it would seem to follow
that an ad valorem tax upon all exports would not be obnoxious to this constitutional prohibition. But surely
under this limitation Congress can impose an export tax
neither on one article of export, nor on all articles of export. In other words, the purpose of the restriction is
that exportation, all exportation, shall be free from natioial burden.' The court found an analogy in the construction which had been given to the commerce clause in
protecting interstate commerce from state legislation imposing direct burdens (Robbins v. Shelby County, 120 U. S.
489, 494); and legislative precedents for the tax were held

to be unavailing in view of the clear meaning and scope
of the constitutional provision.
Following this decision, it was held by the District
Court that the stamp tax on manifests of cargoes for
foreign ports was invalid. These manifests were essential
to the exportation. New York & Cuba Mail S. S. Co. v.
United States, 125 Fed. Rep. 320. And while the casb
was determined in this court upon another ground, the
correctness of this ruling as to the invalidity of the tax
was conceded by the United States. 200 U. S. 488,
491.
Under this established doctrine, we are of the opinion
that the tax upon these charter parties cannot be sustained. A charter party may be a contract for the lease
of the vessel or for a special service to be rendered by the
owner of the vessel. Where, as is very frequently the
case, the ship owner undertakes to carry a cargo, to be
provided by the charterer, on a designated voyage, the
arrangement is in contemplation of law a mere contract of
affreightment. By such a charter, the ship owner is the
carrier of the goods transported by the ship, 'for the reason
that the charter-party is a mere covenant for the conveyance of the merchandise or the performance of the stipulated service.' Marcardier v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., 8
Cranch, 39, 49, 50; Reed v. United States, 11 Wall. 591,
600, 601; Leary v. United States, 14 Wall. 607, 610;
Richardson v. Winsor, 3 Cliff. 395, 399; The T. A. Goddard,
12 Fed. Rep. 174, 178; 1 Parsons on Shipping, p. 278. The
findings in the present case do not permit us to question
the character of the charter parties here involved. It
appears that the defendants in error, being ship brokers,
engaged at various times the vessels respectively, which
are named in the schedule attached to the findings,
solely for the carriage of cargo from ports in the United
States to the foreign ports specified; that is, we understand the findings to mean that these charters were for

described voyages on which 'cargoes of goods were to
be, and were in fact, carried' to the places mentioned.
Instead of a contract for the carriage of a particular lot
of goods occupying less than the entire cargo space, as in
the case of an ordinary bill of lading, the charter party
was a contract for the carriage of a full cargo lot. In
legal principle, there is no distinction which can condemn
the tax in the one case and save it in the other. Whether
the contract of carriage covers a small lot, or a partial
cargo, or an entire cargo-whether the goods occupy a
part of the cargo space or the whole cargo space-can make
no constitutional difference. The charters were for the
exportation; they related to it exclusively; they serve
no other purpose. A tax on these charter parties was in
substance a tax on the exportation; and a tax on the exportation is a tax on the exports.
The Government urges the analogy of tonnage taxes
or duties. The same argument was pressed unsuccessfully in the Fairbank Case, supra, p. 305. It should be
observed that a tonnage tax, as it has been laid by the
Federal Government from the beginning, is a tax on entry.

Feb. 27, 1877, c. 69, 19 Stat. 240, 250; June 26, 1884,
c. 121, § 14, 23 Stat. 53, 57; July 19, 1886, c. 421, § 11,
24 Stat. 79, 81. See TransportationCo. v. Parkersburg,
107 U. S. 691, 696. A duty of tonnage under Article I,
§ 10, of the Constitution, has been described as a charge
'for entering or leaving a port' (Huse v. Glover, 119 U. S.
543, 549), but Congress has not attempted to impose a
tonnage tax for the privilege of leaving a state port for a
foreign port and we have no occasion to consider, the
question of the validity of such a tax. Again, it is contended that the tax bore only incidentally upon exportation. It was tobe paid ofi -all charter parties of Vessels
having a 'registered tonnage.' But, aside jrom any
question as to the scope of this provision, the tax as

applied to the charter parties here in question was nothing
else ,than a tax on exportation and to this extent was in
any event invalid. The s ame principle governs that
has constantly been held to obtain in cases where it has
been sought to give effect to taxes upon interstate commerce under general legislation of the States. In Robbins
v. Shelby County, supra, it was strongly urged, 'as if it
were a material point in the case,' that no discrimination
was made 'between domestic and foreign drummers'that is, between those of the State whose legislation was
in question and those of other States; that all were taxed
alike. But the court held that this did not meet the difficulty, inasmuch as interstate commerce could not 'be
taxed at all, even though the same amount of tax should
be laid on domestic commerce.' This had been decided,
as the court pointed out, in the case of The State Freight
Tax, 15 Wall. 232; and it has become one of the commonplaces of constitutional law. See Brennan v. Titusville,
153 U. S. 289, 304; Caldwell v. North Carolina, 187 U. S.
622, 629; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, 203 U. S. 507, 510;
Crenshaw v. Arkansas, 227 U. S. 389. We know of no
ground upon which a different effect can be given to the
explicit constitutional provision which denies to Congress
the right to tax exportation from the States.
There is a further objection that the goods were not on
the vessel at the time the charter party was made, but
as the charters related only to the exportation this objection is plainly without merit.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS tookno part in the consideration and decision of this case.
