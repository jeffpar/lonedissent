LUMBER UNDERWRITERS
RIFE.

OF NEW YORK v.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF* APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 279. Argued May 13, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.
If the insured can prove that he made a different contract from that
expressed in the policy, he may have it reformed in equity, but he
may not'take. the policy without reading it, and then in -a suit at
law upon it, ask to have it enforced otherwise than according to its
terms.
A policy of insurance-is a document complete in itself, and the fact
that there is.an endorsement stating that it is a renewal of a prior
existing policy which had a provision for renewal therein has no
bearing ox the express terms of the instrument.
A. provision in a policy of insurance prescribing an express condition
cannot be varied by parol evidence to the effect that the insurer knew
that the. condition was being violated and had been violated during
the existence of a prior pohey of which the existing policy purported
to be a renewal.
204 Fed. Rep. 32, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constructionof a policy of
insurance and the right to v,.ry the terms thereof by parol
6vidence, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. R. Lee Bartels for petitioner;
Mr. CaruthersEwing for respondent:
The policy in force when the fire occurred being a renewal of a previous policy, is but a continuation of the
original contract of insurance. Mallette v. Assur. Co., 91

The renewal premium was accepted by the insurer with
full and complete knowledge of every fact now set up as
invalidating the contract.
No waiver of a condition or provision of the policy
could result from any fact known to the insurer's agent
issuing the policy at the time the policy was issuedthe agent being without express authority from the insurer to make the waiver and the written contract providing in substance against this result. Northern Assur.

The written contract whereby the assured agreed that
a continuous clear space of 100 feet shall at all times be
maintained between the property insured and any woodworking or manufacturing establishment cannot be varied
by parol evidence that the assured was not to maintain
such continuous clear space. See authorities supra and

assured's failure to make this warranty good was to give
the insurer the right to abrogate.

it as in full force and received new benefits therefrom,
and became, as a matter of law, charged with its burdens.

MR. JusTicE, HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit upon a policy insuring lumber for one year
from May 22, 1909. The policy contained a warranty by
the assured that a continuous clear space of one hundred
feet should be maintained between the lumber and the
mill of the assured and also a provision requiring any
waivers to be written upon or attached to the instrument.
The lumber was burned during the year, but it appeared
by the undisputed evidence that the warranty had been
broken and the judge directed a verdict for the defendants.
It appeared, however, that the policy was endorsed 'No.
27868 Renewing No. 27566,' and the plaintiffs offered to
prove that pending the earlier policy the defendants had
the report of an inspection that informed them of the actual conditions, showing permanent structures between
where some of the lumber was piled and the mill, that made
the clear space in this direction less than one hundred feet,
and that with that knowledge they issued the present policy and accepted the premium. This evidence was excluded subject to exception. But it was held by the
Circuit Court of Appeals that the jury should have been
allowed to find whether the defendants had knowledge of
the conditions and reasonable expectation that they would

continue and so had waived the warranty. For this reason
the judgment was reversed. 204 Fed. Rep. 32; 122 C. C.
A. 346.
When a policy of insurance is issued, the import of the
transaction, as every one understands, is that the document embodies the contract. It is the dominant, as it
purports to be the only and entire expression of the parties'
intent. In the present case this fact was put in words by
the proviso for the endorsement of any change of terms.
Therefore when by its written stipulation the document
gave notice that a certain term was insisted upon, it would
be contrary to the fundamental theory of the legal relations established to allow parol proof that at the very
moment when the policy was delivered that term was
waived. It is the established doctrine of this court that
such proof cannot be received. Northern Assurance Co. v.
Grand View Building Association, 183 U. S. 308. Northern
Assurance Co. v. Grand View Building Association, 203
U. S. 106, 107. Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Buchanan, 141
Fed. Rep. 877, 883. See Penman v. St. Paul Fire &
Marine Ins. Co., 216 U. S. 311. Etna Life Ins. Co. v.
Moore, 231 U. S. 543, 559. There is no hardship in this
rule. No rational theory of contract can be made that does
not hold the assured to know the contents of the instrument to which he seeks to hold the other party. The assured also knows better than the insurers the condition of
his premises, even if the insurers have been notified of
the facts. If he brings to the making of his contract the
modest intelligence of the prudent wan he will perceive
the incompatibility between the requirement of one hundred feet clear space and the possibilities of his yard, in a
case like this, and will make a different contract, either by
striking out the clause or shortening the distance, or otherwise as may be agreed. The distance of one hundred feet
that was written into this policy was not a fixed conventional formula that there would be trouble in changing, if

the insured would pay what more, if anything, it might
cost* Of course if the insured can prove that he made a
different contract from that expressed in the writing he
may have it reformed in equity. What he cannot do is
to take a policy without reading it and then when he comes
to sue at law upon the instrument ask to have it enforced
otherwise than according to its terms. The court is not
at liberty to introduce a short cut to reformation by letting
the jury strike out a clause.
The plaintiffs try to meet these recognized rules by the
suggestion that after a contract is made a breach of conditions may be waived, void only meaning voidable at the
option of the insurers; Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U. S. 149,
155; that this policy was a renewal of a former one, and
that the case stands as if, after the breach of warranty
had been brought to the notice of the insurers, a premium
had been paid and accepted without a new instrument.
But what would be the law in the case supposed we need
not consider as in our opinion it is not the one before us.
The policy in suit is a document complete in itself. The
endorsement that we have quoted is probably only for
history and convenient reference. We see no ground for
attributing to it any effect upon the contract made. The
fact that the policy has a provision for renewal has no
bearing, and we do not perceive how it would matter if
the previous one had the same. No use was made of the
clause. Therefore in our opinion the principles that we
have laid down apply to the present case, Kentucky Vermilion Mining & ConcentratingCo. v. Norwich Union Firc
Ins. Soc., 146 Fed. Rep. 695, 700, and the action of th3
District Court was right.
Judgment reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA and MR.

JusTicE DAY are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals properly disposed of the case, and dissent.
