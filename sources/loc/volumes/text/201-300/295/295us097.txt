EX REL.

KOELN.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI.

Nos. 659 and 660.

Argued April 10, 1935.--Decided April 29, 1935.

1. The rule that a forfeiture of real property at the suit of the
United States for an offense against the internal revenue laws
relates back to the date of the offense, applies only where there
is an effective judgment of condemnation. Henderson.'s Distilled
Spirits, 14 Wall. 44; United States v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1. P. 99.
2. Where the judgment provided forfeiture but contained alternative provisions allowing the landowner to retain the propdrty
" free of all claims" (meaning all claims of the United States)
upon giving an appeal bond in a specified amount, which was in
fact done, title to the property did not become vested in the United
States and the property thereafter remained subject to state taxes
imposed upon it between the date of the offense and the date of
the judgment. P. 99.
3. A state court is not without jurisdiction to enforce the lien of -a
state tax on real property in a suit begun while a proceeding on
the part of the United States to forfeit title to the same property
was pending in a federal court, where no step was taken in the
state court beyond the filing of the petition until the property
had~been released by the federal court. P. 100.

PER

CURIAM.

These actions were brought in the Circuit Court of the
City of St. Louis to enforce the lien of the State of Missouri upon certain real property. The first action (No.
659), begun -in December, 1925, was for the taxes of 1920
to 1923, and the second (No. 660), brought in December,
1928, was for the taxes of 1924 to 1926. Judgments for
the. plaintiff were affirmed by, the Supreme Court of the
State. 76 S. W. (2d) 417, 421. In view of the contention
that the state court had denied effect to a judgment of the
United States District Court decreeing forfeiture of title
to the United States, writs of certiorari were granted.
It appeared that in 1921, in connection with a lease
of the premises to a distilling company, petitioner and his
wife, as owners, had filed the required consent with respect
to the priority of the lien of the United States for taxes
and penalties (26 U. S. C. 286); that in September, 1923,
the land had been seized by the United States (Yollector of
Internal Revenue for forfeiture on account of violations
of law in removing distilled spirits without payment of
the federal tax (26 U. S. C. 306); that, in January, 1924,
the United States brought a libel for forfeiture in the
United States District Court, and in September, 1928,
obtained a judgment which was affirmed on appeal. Motlow v. United States, 35 F. (2d) 90. Petitioner contends
that the land was in custodia legis, in the federal court,
when the first action in the state court was begun, and, by
virtue of the judgment in the federal court, title vested
in the United States as ,.( the date of the offense upon
which the judgment was based. Henderson's Distilled
Spirits, 14 Wall. 44; United States v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1.
But, although the judgment provided for forfeiture to
the Government, it contained an alternative provision,

MOTLOW v. STATE

inserted pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, that if
the owners paid to the Government the sum of $20,000
within thirty days, the property should be delivered to
them free of all claims. The provision was explicit that,
in that event, "the judgment of forfeiture above entered
shall not be enforcible nor shall it. be enforced, but the
payment of Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars shall
be in full satisfaction of the aforesaid judgment and shall
operate as a release of the lien of said judgment and any
cause of action in favor of the Government as to said
property described in said libel." The judgment als6
provided that, if the owners desired to perfect -anappeal,
they might give bond to the Government in the sum of
$20,000, conditioned as specified in the stipulation, and,
on approval of the bond, possession of the property should
be immediately delivered to the owners "forever released
of -any lien or claim of any kind whatsoever in favor of
the United States Government and the aforesaid bond
shall stand in lieu of and in place of said property." The
bond was given, and the District Court, in September,
1928, ordered the release of the property accordingly.
While, under the statute in question, a judgment of
forfeiture relates back to the date of the offense as'proved,
that result follows only from an effective judgment of
condemnation. Henderson's Distilled Spirits, supra, p.
57. In this instance, there was no such judgment and
hence title did not vest in the United States. As the
title of the owners was not divested, the land remained
subject to the "claim for local taxes. The release "from
all claims," for which the judgment provided, manifestly
referred to claims of the United States and not to claims
of the State. Nor is there merit in the contention that
the state court was without jurisdiction to enforce the
liens for taxes because the property was in custodia legis.
The second suit (No. 660), for the taxes of 1924 to 1926,
was not brought until after the property had been released by the f~leral court in 1928; and, while the first

suit (No. 659) was begun in 1925, it does not appear that
any proceedings beyond the filing of the petition were
taken until 1929. There was no interference with the
custody of the federal court. Heidritterv. Elizabeth OilCloth Co., 112 U. S. 294, 304, 305. Compare Shields v.
Coleman, 157 U. S. 168, 178,179; Zimmerman v. So Relle,
