HERNDON v. GEORGIA.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.
No. 665.

Argued April 12, 1935.-Decided May 20, 1935.

1. An attack upon a statute upon the ground that it is in violation
"of the Constitution of the United States," without further specification, does not raise a federal question. P. 442.
2. A ruling of a state trial court, sustaining an indictment against
preliminary attack, which the Supreme Court of the State declined
to consider because the ruling was not ,preserved in'a bill of exceptions or assigned as error as required by the settled state practice,
can not be considered here upon review of the latter court's judgment, as a basis for raising a federal question. P. 443.
3. An attempt to raise a federal question before a state Supreme
Court upon a petition for*rehearing after judgment, is too late,
unless that court actually entertains the question and decides it.
P. 443.
4. But a federal question first presented to the state, court by
petition for rehearing is in time if it could not have been raised
earlier because the ruling of that court to which it is directed
could not have been anticipated. P. 444.
5. A ruling is not to be regarded as unanticipated by the party
where it is one that follows an earlier decision of the same court
in a similai case. P. 446..

MR.

JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment upon
conviction by a jury in a Georgia court of first instance of
an attempt to incite insurrection by endeavoring to induce
others to join in combined resistance to the authority of
the state to be accomplished by acts of violence, in violation of § 56 of the Penal Code of Georgia.1 The supreme
court of the state affirmid the judgment. 178 Ga. 832;
174 S.E. 597, rehearing denied, 179 Ga. 597; 176 S.E.
620. On this appeal, the statute is assailed as contravening the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
in certain designated particulars. We find it unnecessary
to review the points made, since this court is without
jur'isdiction for the reason that no federal question was
seasonably raised in the court below or passed upon by
that court.
It is true that there was a preliminary attack upon the
indictment in the trial court on the ground, among others,
that the statute was in violation "of the Constitution of
§ '56. Any attempt, by persuasion or otherwise, to induce
others to join in any combined resistance to the lawful authority
of the State shall constitute an attempt to incite insurrec ion."
",Insurrection" is defined by the precediiig section. " § '55. Insur,rection shall consist in any combined resistance to the lawful
authority of the State, with intent to the denial thereof, -when the
same is manifested, or intended to be manifested, by acts of
violence."

the United States," and that this contention was overruled. But, in addition to the insufficiency of the specification,2 the adverse action of the trial-tourt was not preserved by exceptions pendente lite or assigned as error in
due time in the bill of exceptions, as the settled rules of
the state practice require. In that situation, the state
supreme court declined to review any of the rulings of the
trial court in respect of that and other preliminary issues;
and this deternination of the state court is conclusive
here. John v. Paullin,231 U. S. 583, 585; Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. Mims, 242 U. S. 532, 535; Nevada-California-Oregon Ry. v. Burrus, 244 U. S. 103, 105; Brooks

Purdy, 185 U. S. 148, 154; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McGrew, 188 U. S. 291, 308.
The federal question was never properly presented to
the state supreme court unless upon motion for rehearing;
and that court then refused to consider it. The longestablished general rule is that. the attempt to raise a
federal question after judgment, upon a petition for rehearing, comes too late, unless the court actiially entertains the question and decides it. Texas & Pacific Ry.

in giving to the statute a new construction which threatened rights under the Constitution. There is no doubt
that the federal claim was timely if the ruling of the state
court could not have been anticipated and a petition for
rehearing presented the first opportunity for raising it.
Saunders v. Shaw, 244 U. S. 317, 320; Ohio v. Akron Park
District, 281 U. S. 74, 79; Missouri'v. Gehner, 281 U. S.

Great Northern Ry. v. Sunburst Oil Co., 287 U. S. 358,
367. The whole point, therefore, is whether the ruling
here assailed should have been anticipated.
The trial court instructed the jury that the evidence
would not be sufficient to convict the defendant if it did
not indicate that his advocacy would be acted upon immediately; and that-" In order to convict the defendant, . . . it must appear clearly by. the evidence that
immediate serious violence against the State of Georgia
was to be expected or was advocated." Petitioner urges
that the question presented to the state supreme court
was whether the evidence made out a violation of the
statute as thus construed by. the trial court, while the supreme court construed the statute (178 Ga., p. 855) as not
requiring that an insurrection should follow instantly or
at any given time, but that "l it would be sufficient that
he [the defendant] intended it to happen at any time, as
a result of his influence, by those whom he sought to
incite," and upon that construction determined the sufficiency of the evidence against the defendant. If that
were all, the petitioner's contention that the federal question was raised at the earliest opportunity well might be
sustained; but it is not all.
The verdict of the jury was returned on January 18,
1933, and judgment immediately followed. On July 5,
1933, the trial court overruled a motion for new trial. The
original opinion was handed down and the judgment of

HERNDON v. GEORGIA.
441

Opinion of the Court.

the state supreme court entered May 24, 1934, the case
having been in that court since the preceding July.
On March 18, 1933, several months prior to the action
of the trial court on the motion for new trial, the state
supreme court had decided Cart v. State, 176 Ga. 747; 169
In that case § 56 of the Penal Code, under
S. E. 201.
which it arose, was challenged as contravening the Fourteenth Amendment. The court in substance construed
the statute as it did in the present case. In the course of
the opinion it said (p. 750):
"It [the state] can not reasonably be required to defer
the adoption of measures for its own peace and safety
until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate
danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise
of its judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency. . . . 'Manifestly, the legislature has authority
to forbid the advocacy of a doctrine designed and intended
to overthrow the government, without waiting until there
is a present and imminent danger of the success of the
plan advocated. If the State were compelled to wait until the apprehended danger became certain, then its right
to protect itself would come into being simultaneously
with the overthrow of the government, when there would
be neither prosecuting officers nor courts for the enforcement of the law.'
The language contained in the subquotation is taken
from People v. Lloyd, 304 Ill. 23, 35; 136 N. E. 505, and
is quoted with approval by this court'in Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U. S. 652, 669.
In the present case, following the language quoted at an
earlier point in this opinion to the effect that it was sufficient if the defendant intended an insurrection to follow
at any time, etc., the court below, in its original opinion,
(178 Ga. 855) added--" It was the intention of this law to
arrest at its incipiency any effort to overthrow the state

government, where it takes the form of an actual attemnt
to incite others to insurrection." The phrase "at any
time" is not found in the foregoing excerpt from the Carr
case, but it is there in effect., when the phrase is given the
meaning disclosed by the context, as that meaning is
pointed out by the court below in its opinion denying the
motion for a rehearing (179 Ga. 600), when it said that
the phrase was necessarily intended to mean within a
reasonable time-" that is, within such time as one's persuasion, or other adopted means might reasonably be expected -tobe directly operative in causing an'insurrection."
Appellant, of course, cannot plead ignorance of the ruling in the Carrcase, and was therefore bound to anticipate
the probability of a similar ruling in his own case, and
preserve his right to a review here by appropriate action
upon the original hearing in the court below. It follows
that his contention that he raised the federal question at
the first opportunity is without substance, and the appeal
must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
Dismissed.
MR. JusTIcE CARDozo, dissenting.
The appellant has been convicted of an attempt to incite insurrection in violation of § 56 of the Penal Code of
Georgia. He has been convicted after a charge by the
trial court that to incur a verdict of guilt he must have
advocated violence with the intent that his advocacy
should be acted on immediately and with reasonable
grounds for the expectation that the intent would be
fulfilled. The appellant did not contend then, nor does
he contend now, that a statute so restricted would involve
an unconstitutional impairment. of freedom of speech.
However, upon appeal from the judgment of conviction
the Supreme Court of Georgia repudiated the construction adopted at the trial and substituted another.
Promptly thereafter the appellant moved for a rehearing
upon the ground that the substituted meaning made the

HERNDON v. GEORGIA.
441

C iwozo, J., dissenting.

statute unconstitutional, and in connection with that
motion invoked the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. A rehearing was denied with an opinion which
again construed the statute and again rejected the construction accepted in the court below. Now in this court
the appellant renews his plaint that the substituted meaning makes the statute void. By the judgment just announced the court declines to hear him. It finds that he
was tardy in asserting his privileges and immunities under
the Constitution of the United States, -and disclaiming
jurisdiction dismisses his appeal.
I hold the view that the protection of the Constitution
was seasonably invoked and that the court should proceed
to an adjudication of the merits. Where the merits lie
I do not now consider, for in the view of the majority the
merits are irrelevant. My protest is confined to the disclaimer of jurisdiction. The settled doctrine is that when
a constitutional privilege or immunity has been denied
for the first time by a ruling made upon appeal, a litigant
thus surprised may challenge the unexpected ruling by a
motion for rehearing, and the challenge will be timely.
Missouri v. Gehner, 281 U. S. 313, 320; Brinkerhoff-Faris
Trust & Savings.Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673, 678; American
Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287 U. S. 156, 164; Great Northern
Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. .S. 358,
367; Saunders v. Shaw, 244 U. S. 317, 320. Within that
settled doctrine the cause is rightly here.
Though the merits are now irrelevant, the controversy
must be so far explained as to show how a federal question
has come into the record. The appellant insists that
words do not amount to an incitement to revolution, or to
an attempt at such incitement, unless they are of such a
nature and are used in such circumstances as to create "a
clear and present danger" (Schenck v. United States, 249
U. S. 47, 52) of bringing the prohibited result to pass.
He insists that without this limitation a statute so lack-

ing in precision as the one applied against him here is an
unconstitutional restraint upon historic liberties of speech.
For present purposes it is unimportant whether his argument be sound or shallow. At least it has color of support in words uttered from this bench, and uttered with
intense conviction. Schenck v. United States, supra; cf.
Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 374, 375; Fiske v.
Kansas, 274 U. S. 380; Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652,
672, 673; Schaefer v. United States; 251 U. S. 466, 482.
The court might be unwilling, if it were to pass to a decision of the merits, to fit the words so uttered within the
framework of this case. What the appellant is now asking of us is an opportunity to be heard. That privilege is
his unless he has thrown it away by silence and,acquiescence when there was need of speech and protest.
We are told by the state that the securities of the Constitution should have been invoked upon the trial. The
presiding judge should have been warned that a refusal to
accept the test of clear and present danger would be a
rejection of the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment.
But the trial judge had not refused to accept the test proposed; on the contrary, he had accepted it and even gone
a step beyond. In substance he had charged that even
a present "danger" would not suffice, if there was not
also an expectation, and one grounded in reason, that the
insurrection would begin at once. It is novel doctrine
that a defendant who has had the benefit of all he asks,
and indeed of a good deal more, must place a statement
on the record that if some other court at some other time
shall read the statute differently, there will be a denial of
liberties that at the moment of the protest are unchallenged and intact. Defendants charged with crime are
as slow as are men generally to borrow trouble of the
future.
We are told, however, that protest, even if unnecessary
at the trial, should have been made by an assignment of

HERNDON v. GEORGIA.

Cmzoozo, J., dissenting.

error or in some other appropriate way in connection with
the appeal, and this for the reason that by that time, if not
before, the defendant was chargeable with knowledge as
a result of two decisions of the highest court .of Georgia
that the statute was destined to be given another meaning. The decisions relied upon are Carrv. State (No. 1),
176 Ga. 55; 166 S. E. 827; 167 S. E. 103, and Carrv. State
(No. 2), 176 Ga. 747; 169 S. E. 201. The first of these
cases was decided in November, 1932, before the trial of
the appellant, which occurred in January,. 1933. The second was decided in March, 1933, after the appellant had
been convicted, but before the denial or submission of his
motion for a new trial. Neither is decisive of the question
before us now.
Carrv. State, No. 1, came up on demurrer to an indictment. The prosecution was under § 58 of the Penal Code,
which makes it a crime to circulate revolutionary documents.* All that was held was that upon the face of the
indictment there had been a wilful incitement to violence,
sufficient, if proved, to constitute a crime. The opinion
contains an extract covering about four pages from the
opinion of this court in Gitlow v. New York, supra. Imbedded in that long quotation are the words now pointed
to by the state as decisive of the case at hand. They are
the words of Sanford, J., writing for this court. 268 U. S.
at p. 669. "The immediate danger is none the less real
and substantial, because the effect of a given utterance
§ 58. If any person shall bring, introduce, print, or circulate,
or cause to be introduced, circulated, or printed, or aid or assist, or
be in any manner instrumental in bringing, introducing, circulating,
or printing within this State any paper, pamphlet, circular, or any
writing, for the purpose of inciting insurrection, riot, conspiracy, or
resistance against the lawful authority of the State, or against the
lives of the inhabitants thereof, or any part of them, he shall be
punished by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than five
nor longer than twenty years."

cannot be accurately foreseen."

295 U. S.

A state "cannot reason-

ably be required to defer the adoption of. measures for
its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or
imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction;
but it may, in the exercise of its judgment. suppress the
threatened danger in its incipiency."
To learn the meaning of these words in their application to the Georgia statute we must read them in their
setting. Sanford, J., had pointed out that the statute then
before him, the New York criminal anarchy act, forbade
the teaching and propagation by spoken word or writing
of a particular form of doctrine, carefully defined and
after such definition denounced on reasonable grounds as
fraught with peril to the state. There had been a determination by the state through its legislative body that
such utterances "are so inimical to the general welfare
and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may
be penalized in the exercise of its police power." '268
U. S. at p. 668. In such circumstances "the question..
whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely, in and of itself, to bring about the
substantive evil, is not open to consideration. It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that
the use of the language comes within its prohibition."
268 U. S. 670. In effect the words had been placed upon
an expurgatory index. At the same time the distinction
was sharply drawn between statutes condemning utterances identified by a description of their meaning and
statutes condemning them by reference to the results that
they are likely to induce. "It is clear that the question
in such cases [i. e. where stated doctrines are denounced]
is entirely different from that involved in those cases
where the statute merely prohibits certain acts involving
the danger of substantive evil, without any reference to

HERNDON- v. GEORGIA.
441

CARnozo, J., dissenting.

language itself, and it is sought to apply its provisions'to
language used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the. prohibited results." pp. 670, 671. Cf.
Whitney v. California, supra; Fiske v. Kansas, supra.
The effect of all this was to leave the question opei
whether in cases of the second class, in cases, that is to
say, where the unlawful quality of words is to be determined not upon their face but in relation to their consequences, the opinipn in Schenck v. United States, supplies
the operative rule. The conduct charged to this appellant-in substance an attempt to enlarge the membership
of the Communist party in the city of Atlanta-falls, it
will be assumed, within the second of these groupings, but
plainly is outside the first. There is no reason to believe
that the Supreme Court of Georgia, when it quoted from
the opinion in Gitlow's case, rejected the restraints which
the author of that opinion had placed upon his words.
For the "decision of the case before it there was no need to
go so far. Circulation of documents with intent to incite
to revolution had been charged in an indictment. The
state had the power to punish such an act as criminal, or
so the'court had held. How close the nexus would have
to be between the attempt and its projected consequences
was matter for the trial.
Carr v. State, No. 2, like the case under review, was a
prosecution under Penal Code, § 56 (not § 58), and like
Carr v. State, No. 1, came up on demurrer. All that the
court held was that when attacked by demurrer the indictment would stand. This appears from the headnote;
drafted by the court itself. After referring to this headnote, the court states that it may be "useful and salutary" to repeat what it had written in Carrv. State, No. 1.
Thereupon it quotes copiously from its opinion in that
case including the bulk of the same extracts from Gitlow
v. New York. The extracts show upon their face that

452

CADozo, J., dissenting.

295 U. S.

they have in view a statute denouncing a particular doctrine and prohibiting attempts to teach it. They give no
test of the bond of union between an idea and. an event.
What has been said-as to the significance of the opinions
in the two cases against Carr has confirmation in what
happened when appellant was brought to trial. The
judge who presided at that trial had the first of those
opinions before him when he charged the jury, or so we
may assume. He did not read it as taking from the state
the burden of establishing a clear and present danger that,
insurrection would' ensue as a result of the defendant's
conduct. This is obvious from the fact that in his charge
he laid that very burden on the state with emphasis and
clarity. True, he did not have before him the opinion in
prosecution No. 2, for it had not yet been handed down,
but if he had seen it, he could not have gathered from its
quotation of the earlier case that it was announcing novel
*
doctrine.
From all this it results that Herndon, this appellant,
came into the highest court of Georgia without notice that
the statute defining his offense Was to be given a new
meaning. There had been no rejection, certainly no unequivocal rejection, of the doctrine of Schenck v. United
States, which had been made the law of the case by the
judge presiding at his trial. 'For all that the record tells
us, the prosecuting officer acquiesced in the charge, and
did not. ask the appellate court to apply a different test.,
In such a situation the appellant might plant himself as
he did on the position that .on the case given to the jury
his guilt had not been proved. He was not under a duty
to put before his judges the possibility of a definition less
favorable to himself, and make an argument, against i,
when there had been no threat of any change, still less
any forecast of its form or measure. He might wait until
the law of the case had been rejected by the reviewing
court before insisting that the effect would be an invasion

HERNDON v. GEORGIA.
441

CARDozo,

.,. dissenting.

of his constitutional immunities.

If invasion should

occur, a motion for rehearing diligently pressed thereafter
would be seasonable notice. This is the doctrine of Missouri v. Gehner and Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill. It is
the doctrine that must prevail if the great securities of
the Constitution are not to be lost in a web of procedural
entanglements.
New strength is given to considerations such as these
when one passes to a closer view of just what the Georgia
court did in its definition of the statute. We have heard
that the meaning had been fixed by what had been held
already in Carrv. State, and that thereby the imminence
of the danger had been shown to be unrelated to innocence
or guilt. But if that is the teaching of those cases, it was
discarded by the very judgment now subjected to review.
True, the Georgia court, by its first opinion in the case
at hand, did prescribe a test that, if accepted, would bar
the consideration of proximity in time. "It is immaterial
whether the authority of the state was in danger of being
subverted or that an insurrection actually occurred or was
impending." "Force must have been contemplated,
but . . . the statute does not include either its occurrence
or its imminence as an ingredient of the particular offense
chafged." It would not be "necessary to guilt that the
alleged offender should have intended that an insurrection
should follow instantly, or at any given time, but it would
be sufficient that he intended it to happen at any time,
as a result of his influence, by those whom he sought to
incite." On the motion for a rehearing the Georgia court
repelled with a little heat the argument of counsel that
these words were to be taken literally, without "the usual
reasonable implications." "The phrase 'at any time,' as
criticized in the motion for rehearing, was not intended to
mean at any time in the indefinite future, or at any possible later time, however remote." "On the contrary the
phrase' at any time ' was necessarily intended, and should

454

J., dissenting.

295 U. S.

have been understood, to mean within a reasonable time;
ithat is, within such time as one's persuasion or other
adopted means might reasonably be expected to be
directly -operative in causing an insurrection." "Under
the statute as-thus interpreted, we say, as before, that the
evidence was sufficient to authorize the conviction."
Here is an unequivocal rejection of the test of clear and
present danger, yet a denial also of responsibility without
boundaries in time. 'True, in this rejection, the court disclaimed a willingness to pass upon the question as one of
constitutional law, 'assigning as a reason that no appeal
to the Constitution had been made upon the trial or then
considered by the judge. Brown v. State, 114 Ga. 60;
39 S.E. 873; Loftin v. Southern Security Co., 162 Ga. 730;
134 S. E. 760; Dunaway v. Gore, 164 Ga. 219, 230; 138
S. E. 213. Such a rule of state practice may have the
effect of attaching a corresponding limitation to the jurisdiction of this court where fault can fairly be imputed to
an appellant for the omission to present the question
sooner. Erie R. Co. v. Purdy, 185 U. S. 148; Louisville
& Nashville R. Co. v. Woodford, 234 U. S.46, 51. No
such consequence can follow where 'the ruling of the trial
judge has put the Constitution out of the case and made
an appeal to its provisions impertinent and futile. Cf.
Missouri v. Gehner, supra; Rogers v. Alabama, 192 U. S.
226, 230. In such circumstances, the power does not reside in a state by any rule of local practice to restrict the
jurisdiction of this court in the determination of a constitutional question brought into the case 'thereafter.
Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22, 24. If tfie rejection of the
test of clear and present danger was, a denial of fundamental liberties, the path is clear for us to say so.
What was brought into the case upon the Inotion for
rehearing was a standard wholly novel, the expectancy of
life to be ascribed to the persuasive power of an idea.
The defendant had no opportunity in the state court to

WISCONSIN v. MICHIGAN.
441

Syllabus.

prepare his argument accordingly. He had no opportunity to argue from the record that guilt was not a reasonable inference, or one permitted by the Constitution, on
the basis of that test any more than on the basis of others
discarded as unfitting. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, supra. The
argument thus shut out is submitted to us now. Will men
"judging in calmness" (Brandeis, J., in Schaefer v. United
States, supra, at p. 483) say of the defendant's conduct #s
shown forth in the pages of this record that it was an
attempt to stir up revolution through the power of his
persuasion and within the time when that persuasion
might be expected to endure? If men so judging will
say yes, will the Constitution of the United States uphold
a reading of the statute that will lead to that response?
Those are the questions that the defendant lays before
us after conviction of a crime punishable by death in the
discretion of the jury. I think he should receive an
answer.
