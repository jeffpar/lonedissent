Statement of the Case.

implies a broad discretion and thus permits a wide range
even of mistakes. Expert discussion of pension plans
reveals different views of the manner in which they should
be set up and a close study of advisable methods is in
progress. It is not our province to enter that field, and
I am not persuaded that Congress in entering it for the
purpose of regulating interstate carriers, has transcended
the limits of the authority which the Constitution confers.
I think the decree should be reversed.
I am authorized to state that MR. JusTICE BRANDEmS,
MR. JusTicE STONE, and MR. JusacdCAmozo join in this

opinion.

Per Curiam.

Mr. Harold E. Cole, with whom Messrs. Benjamin A.
Levy and Joseph B. Jacobs were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Herbert B. Barlaw was on the brief for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

In this suit for injunction to restrain an alleged infringement of a patent, and for an accounting, the Circuit
.Court of Appeals, on November 10, 1934, vacated an interlocutory decree for injunction and directed the District
Court to dismiss the bill. On February 4, 1935, this Court
granted a writ of certiorari. Upon the argument at this
bar, respondent suggested that there had been a change
in conditions since the decision of the .Court of Appeals
and the case was continued to permit counsel to submit
briefs upon the questions thus raised. Briefs have been
submitted accordingly.
It appears that after the decree of the Court of Appeals,
and on January 17, 1935, the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in a suit brought by. peti-.
tioner (its name having been changed.to the H. W. Peters
Corporation), appointed a receiver "of the estate, property, moneys, debts and effects of every kind and nature"
belonging, to petitioner. Later, on February 25, 1935,
after the writ of certiorari had been granted, the state
court authorized the receiver "to sell at public sale all
right, title and interest that the receiver may have " in
the present suit, which Was described as" pending in the
United States Supreme Court entitled 'Peters Patent
Corporationv. Bates & Klinke, Inc.,' being No. 601 of the
October Term, 1934." The sale was made accordingly
and was confirmed by the state court on February 27,1935.
From the petition to confirm the sale it appears that the
receiver stipulated that "he was not selling any right or
title in and to any patents belonging to the plaintiff corporation."

Counsel for Parties.

295 U. S.

Harriet E. Cole, the purchaser at the receiver's sale,
has asked leave to intervene in this Court, but as she has
not acquired through her purchase the title to, or an interest in, the patent, she is not entitled to seek an injunction to restrain infringement. Crown Die & Tool Co. v.
Nye Tool Works, 261 U. S. 24, 38, 39; Boomer v. United
Power Press Co., 13 Blatch. 107, 112, 113; Kaiser v.
General PhonographSupply Co., 171 Fed. 432, 433. The
right to such an injunction underlies the equitable jurisdiction here invoked. Root v. Railway Co., 105 U. S. 189.
The motion for leave to intervene is denied.
By order of the state court, the receiver, as such, succeeded to the patent right and to the cause of action here
involved. But the receiver, while retaining the patent,
has disposed, with the approval of the state court, of his
entire interest in the present suit against respondent. As
the petitioner in these circumstances is not in a position
to maintain this suit, the Court is of the opinion that the
writ of certiorari should be,
Dismissed.
