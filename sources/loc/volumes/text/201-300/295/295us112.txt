Opinion of-the Court.

255 U. S. 509, 516. Busch v. ,Commissioner,50 F. (2d)
800, distinguished.
The attorney's fee is a necessary business expense of the
guardian. The law demanded that he take appropriate
action to recover the income for his ward and the conduct
of the resulting litigation, through the Circuit Court of
Appeals, of necessity required the employment of competent counsel and payment of reasonable charges for services rendered.
"Business" has been defined by this Court in Flint v.
Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 171, as "a very tomprehensive term and embraces everything about which a
person can be employed."
The decision of the lower court is contrary to the decisions of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Board of Tax Appeals, as well as the rulings
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Commissioner v.

tion to secure income for his ward, was a business expense
within § 214 (a) (1), Revenue Act, 1924, and therefore
deductible from the minor's gross income. The facts,
as stated by the court below, were these"Catherine L. Van Wart, a minor; was the beneficiary
of a trust created by the will of her grandfather, Jenkins
Jones, deceased. Dr. Roy M. Van Wart, Catherine's
father, with whom she resided in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, after being confirmed by order of the district court
for that Parish in accordance with the laws of .Louisiana
as her natural tutor or guardian, and after duly qualifying as such. demanded of the trustees under the will
that they pay over to him the accrued income of the
trust created in favor of his ward. The trustees, claiming among other things the right to keep possession of the
accumulations of such income until Catherine should become of age, when they conceded she would be entitled
to the corpus as well as all accumulated income, declined
to comply with that demand. Thereupon suit was
brought in the name of the minor, by her father as next
friend, in the federal court for the district in West Virginia in which the testator was residing at the time of
his death, against the trustees to compel distribution of.
the income involved in accordance with the guardian's
previous demand. That suit finally was decided in favor
of the plaintiff, it being held that the guardian was entitled to receive from the trustees his ward's accumulated
income and future income as it annually accrued. Van
Wart v. Jones, 295 F. 287. Accordingly, in 1924 the
trustees paid over to Dr. Van Wart as guardian the accumulated income of $160,000 and current in6ome of
$80,000; and Dr. Van Wart, acting as guardian and by
authority of the court of his appointment, paid out of
the funds so received by him a fee of $30,000 to the attorneys who brought the suit for their services in the litigation. .In the income tax return for 1924, which .was

filed by the guardian on behalf of his ward, a deductioi
of the attorneys' fee was claimed."
Pertinent provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 arc
in the margin.*
The Board of Tax Appeals held the attorney's fee was
deductible as an ordinary and necessary expense in carrying on business. § 214 (a) (1). The Commissioner claimed
it was personal expense of the minor taxpayer, excluded
from deduction by § 215 (a) (1), and the court below
upheld this view. It declined to follow Commissioner
v. Wurts-Dundas, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 54 F. (2d) 515.. Because of this conflict the cause.
is here.
We agree with the conclusion that the ward, not the
guardian, was the taxpayer. The return was filed by him
in her behalf; the taxable income was hers, not his. The
* Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253:

"Sec. 2. (a) When used in this Act"(1) The term 'person' means an individual, a trust or estate,
a partnership, or a corporation.
"(9) The term 'taxpayer' means any person subject to a tax imposed by this Act.
"Sec. 214. (a) In computing net income there shall be allowed as
deductions:
"(1) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business,
"Sec. 215. (a) In computing net income no deduction shall in any
case be allowed in respect of"(1) Personal, living, or family expenses.
"See. 225. (a) Every fiduciary (except a receiver appointed by
authority of law in possession of part only of the property of an
individual) shall make under oath a return for any of the following
individuals, estates, or trusts for which he acts, stating specifically
the items of gross income thereof and the deductions and credits
allowed under this -title"(1) Every individual having a net income for the taxable year
of $1,000 or over, if single, or if married and not living with husband
or wife."

attorney's fee arose out of litigation conducted in the
name of the ward. It was paid for her benefit out of her
income.
In Freulerv.Helvering, 291 U. S. 35, 44, we said: "The
whole of the minor's income received by his guardian is
taxable to the minor irrespective of its accumulation in
the guar.diari's hands, distribution to the minor or pay-.
ment for his support or education. .. . Either the
minor. or his guardian must make the return, but in either
case it embraces all the -income and is the minor's individual return, not that of the guardian or the trust."
The.ward was not engaged in any business. So far as
appears the same thing is true of the guardian. See Kornhauser v. United States, 276 U. S. 145; Commissioner v.
Field,42 F. (2d) 820; Hutchings v. Burnet, 61 App. D. C.
109; 58 F. (2d) 514; Walker v. Commissioner, 63 F: (2d)
351; L.indley -V.Commissioner, 63 F. (2d) 807. Moreover,
guardianship is not recognized by the statute as a taxable
entity.

1. Overdraft checks, drawn on a bank affiliated with a clearing-house,
were presented to the drawee, through a clearing-house settlement,
by a member bank which had received them from an indorser bank
for collection. The drawee failed to comply with a clearing-house
rule requiring it to notify the member bank within a specified time
in case of nonpayment, but returned the checks later, for reimbursement, to the indorser bank, which was neither a member nor
