FEDERAL LAND BANK v. PRIDDY.

Syllabus.

While it seems- beyond the resources of judicial ingenuity to construe the statute so as to give it a wholly
consistent and harmonious operation, we think the construction which we adopt conforms to its language and
to the principles of the common law, in the light of which
it must be interpreted. It does not deny to the employer
subrogation to the rights of those dependents receiving
compensation to share in the recovery for wrongful
death, but it leaves undisturbed the rights of the next
of kin who, as § 33 (a) permits, elect to receive the benefits of the Wrongful Death Act rather than compensation.

FEDERAL LAND BANK OF ST. LOUIS v. PRIDDY,

CIRCUIT JUDGE.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 594. Argued April 5, 1935.-Decided April 29, 1935.
1. Rulings by a State court that a Federal Land Bank is a foreign
corporation within 'the meaning of the State's attachment statute
and that an attachment of its pfoperty was authorized by the
state law, present local questions not opento review by this Court.
P. 231.
2. Federal Land Banks are federal instrumentalities, with a governmental functi6n;' and the extent to which they-are amenable to
judicial process is a question of congressional intent. P. 231.
3. Section 4 of the Federal Farm Loan Act provides that Federal
Land Banks "shall have power ... to sue and be sued ... as
fully as natural persons "; they are given some of the characteristics of private business corporations, and the remedies afforded
to their creditors by the Act are the same that it affords to creditors of Joint Stock Banks, which are privately owned corporations,
organized for profit to their stockholders. Furthermore, the Act
ance carrier may maintain the action against the wrongdoer. See
Zirpola v. Casselman, Inc., supra, 373; Travelers Insurance Co. v..

Opinion of the Court.

expressly exempts Federal Land Banks, but not Joint Stock Banks,
from taxation. Held:
(1) That the liability of Federal Land Banks to suit includes,
by implication, the process of execution and attachment. P. 232.
(2) The question is reserved as to whether attachment would be
allowable if shown to interfere with any function performed by
such bank as a federal instrumentality. P. 237.
4. Immunity of corporate government agencies from suit and judicial process, and their incidents, is less readily implied than
immunity from taxation. P. 235.
5. Semble that the Act passed by Congress in 1873, amending § 2
of the National Bank Act of 1864 by providing that n6 attachment
or execution shall issue against a national bank in any state court
before final judgment, was a recognition that the liability of such
banks to suit "as fully as natural persons" under the Act of
1864, extended to such process by implication. P. 236.

CERTIORARI, 294 U. S. 700, to review a judgment refusing a writ of prohibition to restrain a state judge from
proceeding with an action against a Federal Land Bank,
begun by attachment.
Mr. Peyton R. Evans, with whom Messrs. Scott W.
Hovey, John Thorpe, and J. R. Crocker, and Miss May T.
B igelow were on the brief, for petitioner.
No appearance for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

A real estate broker brought suit in the Circuit Court
for Pope County, Arkansas, against petitioner, incorporated under Act of Congress (Federal Farm Loan Act,
July 17,,1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 360), and domiciled in Missouri, to recover a brokerage commission. Pursuant to
local law (Crawford & Moses' Digest, §§ 1159-1163), he
began the suit by attachment of real estate of the petitioner in the county, as that of-a foreign corporation.

Petitioner appeared specially in the circuit court and
moved to vacate the attachment, on the grounds that it is

Opinion of the Court.

not a foreign corporation subject to attachment under the
pertinent statutes of Arkansas, and that it is a federal
instrumentality, immune from mesne process of attachment, by virtue of its organization and functions under
the statutes of the United States. On denial of the motion, petitioner sought of the Supreme Court of the State
a writ of prohibition directed to respondent, the Circuit
Judge, which was denied. 189 Ark. 438; 74 S. W. (2d)
222. We brought the case here on certiorari.
The ruling of the state Supreme Court, that petitioner
is a foreign corporation within the meaning of the Arkansas attachment statute, and that the attachment was
authorized by local law, presents only a state question,
which is not open for review here. The sole question for
our consideration is whether the petitioner is exempt from
attachment because it is a federal agency or instrumentality which Congress has not expressly subjected to judicial
process.
Without now entering into a detailed examination of the
subject, it is sufficient that this Court has already had occasion to consider the organization and functions of federal land banks, and to declare that they are instrumentalities of the federal government, engaged in the performance of an important governmental function. Smith v.
Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180; Federal
Land Bank v. Gaines, 290 U. S. 247. As such, so far as
they partake of the sovereigh, character of the United
States, Congress has full- power to determine the extent
to which they may be subjected to suit and judicial process. See Eastern TransportationCo. v. United States, 272
U. S. 675, 677. Whether federal agencies are subjected to
suit and, if so, the lxtent to which they are amenable to
judicial process, is thus a question of the congressional
intent. See The Lake Monroe, 250 U. S. 246, 249; Sloan
Shipyards v. U. S. Shipping Board, 258 U. S. 549; Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Ault, 256 U, S. 554, 559. If the

answer is not made plain by the words of the statute, it is
necessary to ascertain, by examination of the purposes
and organization of the federal farm loan system, whether
immunity from attachment is granted by .mplication.
Corp., 276 U. S. 575.
Shaw v.
Oilthe
SeeSection
4 of
Federal Farm Loan Act provides
that
federal land banks "shall have power . ' . to.sue and be
sued, complain, interplead, and defend, in any court of
law, and equity, as fully as natural persons." This express
waiver of immunity from suit narrows the inquiry to the
question whether liability to suit includes by implication judicial process of attachment and execution, which
are usual incidents of suits against natural persons. For
it is conceded that if the liability to suit includes liability
to execution, it would equally include liability to process
of attachment, by which the property seized is held subject to execution.
In interpreting § 4, it is to be borne in mind that federal
land banks, although concededly federal instrumentalities,
possess also some of the characteristics of private business
corporations.1 See Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, supra,
254. The statute does not contemplate that their stock is
to be wholly, or even chiefly, government owned.2 Its
'The legislative history of the Federal Farm Loan Act shows that
Cougress understood that many of the activities of the federal land
banks were to be of a private character. See Report, Joint Cong.
Comm., H. R. Doe. No. 494, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6; Report of
Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, No. 144, 64th Cong., Ist
Sess., p. 2, Remarks of Senator Hollis, sponsor of the bill, 53 Cong.
Rec. 6854. For this reason the Senate gave extended consideration
to the constitutionality of exempting federal land banks from state
taxation. 53 Cong. Rec. 6961-6970, 7305-7318, 7372-7378.
'The original capitalization of the twelve federal land banks was
$9,000,000, of which the Treasury subscribed $8,892,130. (Federal
Farm Loan Board, Annual Report, 1917, p. 13.) As the national
farm loan associations, made up of individual borrowers, were organized and borrowed from the banks, they were required to purchase

acquisition by private investors is permitted, § 5, and its
subscription by the borrowing national farm loan associations is compulsory, §'7. The operations of the federal
land banks are, in part at least, for profit. § 5. In theconduct of their business they may enter into contracts,
§ 4, borrow money, receive interest and fees, § 13, pay the
expenses and commissions of agents, § 15, and pay dividends on their stock, § 5. While they are required to de-,
posit in trust farm mortgages as security for farm loan
bonds, § 13, they may acquire and dispose of property in
,their own right, including land. § 13. They thus have
many of the characteristics of private business corporations, distinguishing them from the Government itself and
its municipal subdivisions, and from corporations wholly
government owned and created to effect an exclusively
governmental purpose. This is a circumstance which
gives some support to the inference that the intended
scope of the liability to suit includes judicial process incident to suit. See District of Columbia v. -Woodbury,
136 U. S. 450, 456; Clallam County v. United States, 263
U. S. 341, 345.
The implication finds support also in the fact that the
remedies afforded by the Federal Farm Loan Act to creditors of federal land banks are identical with those given
to creditors of joint stock land banks. Joint stock land
stock in the bantU. § 7. By this method the original Treasury subscription was almost wholly retired, and only $204,698 of the issued
capital stock, S65,676,130, was Government owned in 1931. (Federal
Farm Loan Board, Annual Report, 1931, p. 21.) Recent legislation
has resulted in a large increase in the capitil stock and surplus of the
federal land banks, contributed by the Governmetit. See Act of January 23, 1932, c. 9, 47 Stat. 12, 12 U. S. C. 698; Act of June 16,
1933, c. 100, 48 Stat. 274, 279; cf. Act of January 31, 1934, c. 7, 48
Stat. 344, 12 U. S. C. 1020 et seq. But the liability to judicial
process cannot be thought to fluctuate with the varying amount of
the government investment. See Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Shipping
Board, 258 U. S. 549, 566.

Opinion of the Court.

295 U; S.

banks are privately owned corporations, organized for
profit to their stockholders through the business of making
loans on farm mortgages. § 16. There is nothing in their
organization and powers to suggest that they are government instr.umentalities. Section 16 declares that "except
as otherwise provided, joint stock land banks shall have
the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions and
conditions imposed on, Federal land banks by this Act,
so far as such restrictions and conditions are applicable . . ." There is no other provision relating to their
general corporate powers'and liabilities. Section 29 provides that "upon default of any obligation, Federal land
banks and joint stock land banks may be declared insolvent and placed in the hands of a receiver by the Farm
Credit Administration [Federal Farm Loan Board] . .
Except for § 4, subjecting federal land banks to suit, made
applicable to joint stock land banks by § 16, there is no
other remedy provided for creditors of either class of
banks whose judgments are unpaid, and the receivership
is available only through the favorable action of the Farm
Credit Administration. In view of the character of the
business of joint stock land banks, there is no ground for
supposing that Congress intended, to render their property
immune from seizure by judicial process and thus to make
a receivership, if permitted by the Farm Credit Administration, the sole means of compelling payment of judgments against them, or that it would have extended to
them the provisions and restrictions of § 16 if it had been
thought to exempt them from attahment and execution.
The inference is strong that by treating the two types of
corporations alike with respect to liability to suit and
attachment, the one, as much as the other, was intended
to be subject to judicial seizure of its property, such as
.is ordinarily incident, to suits, to which both are expressly
made subject.
It is of some significance, also, that Congress thought it
necessary, by the terms of § 26, to exempt federal land

banks from taxation, a provision which is not made applicable to joint stock land banks. There is thus a specific
grant of immunity from taxation, to a corporation having
its own purposes as well as those of the United States, and
interested in profits on its own account, see Clailam
County v. United States, supra, 344, 345; compare The
Lake Monroe, supra, 256, in contrast to the legislative
silence as to attachment and execution in suits to which
the bank is liable. This affords additional evidence of
the congressional judgment that attachment and. execution, as distinguished from liability to taxation, are not
obstacles to the performance of the governmental functions
committed to federal land -banks. Had it been intended
otherwise it would seem to have been at least equally
necessary to provide specifically for immunity from attachment and levy, as was done in § 10 of the Federal
Railroad Control Act, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 456, which subjected rail carriers under federal control to liability to suit.
Immunity of corporate government agencies from suit arid
judicial process, and their incidents, is less readily implied
than immunity from taxation. See The Lake Monroe,
supra;Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Shipping Board, 258U. S.
549, 566-568; Olson v. U. S. Spruce Corp., 267 U. S. 462;
U. S. Shipping Board v. Harwood, 281 U. S. 519, 524-526;
compare The Davis, 10. Wall. 15; National Volunteer
Home v. Parrish,229 U. S. 494; StandardOil Co. v. United
States, 267 U. S. 76, 79.
In prescribing liability to suit, the qualifying phrase
"as fully as natural persqns is not customary in acts
defining the powers and duties of private corporations, or
usual in those creating corporations to perform 'federal
functions.' It appears in § 8 of the National Banking
'See, e. g., the acts creating the Federal Reserve Banks, c. 6, § 4,
38 Stat. 251, 254, 12 U. S. 0. 341; the War Finance Corporation,

Act, enacted in 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 101, which authorized national banks "to sue and be sued, complain
and defend, in any court of law and equity as fully as
natural persons." In 1873 the National Banking Act was
amended, c. 269, § 2, 17 Stat. 603, to provide that "no
attachment, injunction, or execution shall be issued against
such association, or its property, before final judgment in
any such suit, action, or proceeding in any State, county
or municipal court." (R. S. § 5242, 12 U. S. C. 91.) This
amendment, which impliedly saved the right of execution
upon judgments against national banks, while forbidding
attachment, would seem to be a recognition by Congress
that the liability of national banks to suit "as fully as
natural persons" extends by implication to attachment
and execution. See PacificNational Bank v. Mixter, 124
U. S. 721; Van Reed v. People's National Bank, 198 U. S.
554; compare Earle v. Pennsylvania, 178 U. S. 449, 454.
The legislative history of this section of the National
Banking Act suggests that the like provision, without the
amendment, was incorporated in the Federal Farm Loan
Act as sufficient to subject federal land banks to the same
liability to attachment to which national banks were
deemed to be subject before the amendment of the
National Banking Act.
While none of these considerations, taken alone, may
be enough to give clear indication of the congressional
purpose, their cumulative effect is persuasive that federal
land banks, like joint stock land banks, were intended to
be subject to the incidents of suit, including attachment

and execution. In creating federal land banks as government instrumentalities, but with many of the pilrposes
and activities of private corporations; in exempting them
alone from taxation, and at the same time subjecting
them, like joint stock land banks, to suit "as fully as
natural persons," Congress cannot be thought to have intended that either class of banks should be immune from
attachment, and their judgment creditors relegated to a
receivership, allowed as a matter of grace, as the sole
means of collecting their judgments.
In the present case it does not appear that the attachment would directly ifiterfere with any function performed
by petitioner as a federal instrumentality. We reserve the
question whether a different result would be required if
such an interference were shown.
