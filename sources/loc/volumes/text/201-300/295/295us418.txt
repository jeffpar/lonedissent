v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 817.

Argued May 6, 7, 1935.-Decided May 20, 1935.

1. Income on funds derived from the restricted allotment of a fullblood Creek Indian which are in excess of his needs and are held
.by the United States in trust for him under the direction of the
Secretary of the Interior, is subject to the federal income tax.
Revenue Act, 1928, §§ 11 and 12. Pp. 419-420.
2. In this regard, the sweeping general terms of the taxing Act must
prevail, as there is nothing in the Creek Agreement of 1901, the
supplemental agreement of 1902, the Act of April 26, 1906, or
the Act of May 27, 1908, which definitely expresses an intent to
exempt such income from taxation. Pp. 420-421.
3. Taxation by the United States of income received from trust
funds held for its Indian ward, who is a citizen of the United
States, is not inconsistent with the relation of guardianship. P. 421.
75 F. (2d) 183, affirmed.

derived from his restricted allotment, in excess of his
needs, were invested. The proceeds therefrom were collected and held in trust under direction of the Secretary
of Interior. The question now presented is whether this
income was subject to the federal tax laid by the 1928
Revenue Act (c. 852, §§ 11, 12, 45 Stat. 791). The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals and the court below
answered in the affirmative.
Petitioner maintains that the court should have followed the rule which it applied in Blackbird v. Commissioner, 38 F. (2d) 976; also that it erroneously held Congress intended to tax incbme derived from investment of
funds arising from restricted lands belonging to a fullblood Creek Indian.
Blackbird, restricted full-blood Osage, maintained that
she was not subject to the federal income tax statute.
The court sustained that view and declared:
"Her property is under the supervising control of the
United States. She is its ward, and we cannot agree that
because the income statute, Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057),
and Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227), subjects 'the net income
of every individual' to the tax, this is alone sufficient to
make the Acts applicable to her. Such holding would be
contrary to the alhost unbroken policy of Congress in
dealing with its Indian wards and their affairs. Whenever they and their interests have been the subject affected by legislation they have been named and their
interests specifically dealt with."
This does not harmonize with what we said in Choteau v.
Burnet (1931), 283 U. S. 691, 693, 696:
"The language of §§ 210 and 211 (a) [Act 1918] subjects the income of 'every individual' to tax. Section
213 (a) includes income 'from any source whatever,",
'Like provisions are in §§ 210 and 211 (a) Rev. Acts 1921, 1924,
1926, and §§ 11 and 12 (a) Act of 1928; § 213 (a) Acts 1921, 1924,
1926 and § 22 Act of 1928.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

The intent of Congress was to levy the tax with respect
to all residents of the United States and upon all sorts of
income. The Act does not expressly exempt the sort of
income here involved, nor a person having petitioner's
status respecting such income, and we are not referred to
any other statute which does. . . . The intent to exclude
must be definitely expressed, where, as here, the language
of the Act laying the tax is broad enough to include the
subject matter."
The court below properly declined to follow its quoted
pronouncement in Blackbird's case. The terms of the 1928
Revenue Act are very broad, and nothing there indicates that Indians are to be excepted. See Irwin,v. Gait,
268 U. S. '161; Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., 275 U. S.
232; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda, Bank, 293 U. S.
84; Pitman v. Commissioner, 64 F. (2d) 740. The purpose is sufficiently clear.
It is affirmed that "inalienability and nontaxability
go hand in hand; and that it is not lightly to be assumed
that Congress intended to tax the ward for the benefit
of the guardian."
The general terms of the taxing act include the income
under consideration, and if exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act
of Congress dealing with their affairs.
Neither the Creek agreement of 1901 nor the supplemental agreement (1902) conferred general exemption
from taxation up6n "Indians; homesteads only were definitely excluded, although alienation 6f allotted lands was
restricted.
The suggestion that exemption must be inferred from
the Act of April 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 137) or May 27, 1908

SUPERINTENDENT v. COMMISSIONER.

Opinion of the Court.

(35 Stat. 312) is not well founded. The first of these
extended restrictions upon the alienation of allotments for
twenty-five years unless sooner removed by Congress, and
provided: "Sec. 19. . . . That all lands upon which restrictions are removed shall be gubject to taxation, and
the other lands shall be exempt from taxation as long as
the title remains in the original allottee." This exemption related to land and not to income derived from investment of surplus income from land. Moreover, the
Act itself was superseded by the second one, which did not
contain the quoted provision, but declared: "Sec. 4. That
all lands from which restrictions have been or shall be
removed shall be subject to taxation and all other civil
burdens as though it were the property of other persons
than allottees of the Five Civilized Tribes ... "
We find nothing in either act which expresses definite
intent to exclude from taxation such income-as that here
involved' See Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276
U. S.575, 581.
Nor can we conclude that taxation of income from .trust
funds of an Indian ward is so inconsistent with that relationship that exemption is a necessary implication. Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct
things. Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S.665, 673. The taxpayer here is a citizen of the United States, and wardship
with limited power over his property does not, without
more, render him immune from the common burden.
Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., supra, held that
restricted land purchased for a full-blood Creek-ward of
the United States-with trust funds was not free from
state taxation, and declared that such exemption could
not be implied merely because of the restrictions upon the
Indian's power to alienate.
Affirmed.
