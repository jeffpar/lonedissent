SENIOR v. BRADEN ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO.

No. 658. Argued April 9, 10, 1935.-Decided May 20, 1935.
1. Where the validity of a state tax is challenged under the Federal
Constitution, this Court must determine for itself the nature and
incidence of the tax. P. 429..
2. A resident of Ohio owned transferable ttAs certificates showing
him to be a beneficiary under separate deeds of trust on several
parcels of land, some situated within and some outside of the
State. Each certificate declared him to be the owner of a specified fractional interest in the property held in the trust under
which it was issued. Each trustee was bound by his declaration
of trust to hold and manage the property for the use and benefit
of certificate owners; to collect and distribute among them the
rents; and in case of sale to make pro-rata distribution of the
proceeds. Each trustee held only one parcel of land and in the
management thereof was free from control by the beneficiaries.
Each parcel had been assessed in the name of the legal owner or
lessee for local real estate taxes, without deduction on account of
any interest of the certificate owners. Held, the attempt of Ohio
to subject the beneficial interests represented by the certificates
to a tax imposed on "investments" and other intangible property,
measured by a percentage of the iicome yield-investments being
so defined by the'statute as to include equitable interests in land
and rents divided into shares evidenced by transferable certificatesis unconstitutional both in respect of such interests in land outside
of the State and orthose in land within the State. Pp. 428, 433.

interest is a chose in action, no matter what may be thenature of the trust reg. This Court has decided, however, that an equitable interest in property will be regarded as property of the same kind as the trust res,

Argument for Appellant.

Co. v. Board of Revision, 284 U. S. 23. See also, Chisholm v. Shields, 67 Oh. St. 374.
It is unconstitutional discrimination to tax equitable
interests in land "divided into shares evidenced by transferable certificates" and to exempt from taxation (a) the
same equitable interests when not represented by such
certificates; (b) legal interests in land, whether divided
into shares or not, and whether represented by transfer-able certificates or not.
A State has no right to tax evidence of the interest in
property, apart from the thing itself. Selliger v. Kentucky, 213 U. S. 200; Cassidy v. Ellerhorst, 110 Oh. St.
535; State v. Davis, 85 Oh. St. 43, 56; Ball v. Towle Mfg.
Co., 67 Oh. St. 306, 314.
If this were an income tax, it would violate the Fourteenth Amendment, inasmuch as the owners of equitable
interests" in real estate divided into shares represented
by transferable certificates are the only persons in Ohio
who are subjected to taxes on the "income yield" in addition to the customary property taxes .levied and assessed
on the real estate itself.
The tax is not an income tax, nor even a gross receipts
tax, because it is not based on the income or gross receipts
of the taxpayer. The conclusion must be that "income
yield" was used as a basis for determining a property tax.
This is evident from the report of the Special Joint Taxation Committee on the Revision of the Ohio Taxation
System. Friedlanderv. Gorman, 126 Oh. St. 163.
The real estate in which appellant has an interest has
been taxed to the lessor or the lessee for its full value.
To tax these particular equitable interests, in addition to
the legal interests, when other real estate is not taxed on
both, is double, discriminatory taxation and, therefore,
unconstitutional.

Argument for Appellees.

295 U. S.

Mr. John W. Bricker, Attorney General of Ohio, and
Mr. E. G. Schuessler, Assistant Attorney General, with
whom Messrs. Louis J. Schneider, Walter M. Locke, and
Thomas C. Lavery were on the brief, for appellees.
No federal question is presented. The nature of the
interest of the appellant in the several trust estates is
purely a question of local law, and the decision of the
Supreme Court of Ohio is not reviewable.
The syllabus of the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Ohio shows that that court held that the interest of the
appellant is not laild or an interest in land, but consists
of a bundle of equitable choses in action, viz: rights to
participate in the net rental of the real estate being
administered by the respective trusts, as to the taxation
of which constitutional limitations upon the power to tax
land or interests therein have no application.
In the case of intangible personal property, considerations applicable to ownership of physical objects are inapplicable, and taxation of such property at the place of
,domicile of the owner has been uniformly upheld. State
Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300; Kirtland v.

Nat. Bank v. Maine, 284 U. S. 312.
It may be candidly-admitted that, under the Fourteenth
Amendment, the State of Ohio has no power to tax land or
interests in land situated beyond its borders; nor has it
power to tax land or interests in land situate within the
State in any other manner than by uniform rule according
to value, under Art. XII, § 2, of the Constitution of Ohio.
From this it follows as a matter of course that if the
property of the appellant which the appellees seek to tax
in this case is land, or an interest in land, situated

within or without the State, their" action is unconstitutional and should be permanently enjoined. If, however, the property of the appellant in the several trusts
is unequivocally shown by the record in this case to be in
fact a species of intangible personal property, in the nature of a bundle of equitable choses in action, then the
State of Ohio has the power to impose the tax which the
appellees, pursuant to provisions of the General Code of'
Ohio, have sought to do, without offending either the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Art. XII,
§ 2 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

Appellant owned transferable certificates showing that
he was beneficiary under seven separate declarations of
trust, and entitled to stated portions of rents derived from
specifi'd parcels of land-some within Ohio, some without. On account of these beneficial interests he received
$2,231.29 during 1931. The lands are adequately described in the margin.3
The tax officers of Hamilton County, where appellant
resided, threatened to assess these beneficial interests, and
then to collect a tax of five percentum of the income thereDeposits not taxed at the source shall be listed and assessed at the
amount thereof in dollars on the day as of which they are required
to be listed. "Moneys shall be listed and assessed at the amount
thereof indollars on hand on the day as of which" they are required
to be listed. In listing investments, the amount of the income yield
of each for the calendar year next preceding the date of listing shall,
,excepting as otherwise provided in thisF chapter, be stated in dollars
and cents and the assessment thereof shall be at the amount of
such income yield; but any-property defined as investments in either
of the first two subparagraphs of section 5323 of the General Code
which has yielded no income during such calendar year shall be
listed and assessed as unproductive investments, at the true value
thereof, in money, on the day as of which such investments are
required to be listed.

from. To prevent this, he instituted suit in the Common
Pleas Court. The petition asked that § 5323,, General
Code, be declared unconstitutional and that appellees be
restrained from taking the threatened action. The trial
court granted relief as prayed; the Court of Appeals reversed and its action was approved by the Supreme Court.
With commendable frankness counsel admit that under
the Fourteenth Amendment the State has "no power to
tax land or interests in land situate beyond its borders;
nor has it power to tax land or interests in land- situate
within the State in any other manner than by uniform
rule according to value." Consequently, they say, "if
the property of appellant, which the appellees seek to
tax in this case, is land or interest in land situate within
or without the State, their action is unconstitutional and
should be permanently enjoined."
The validity of the tax under the Federal Constitution
is challenged. Accordingly we must ascertain for ourselves upon what it was laid. Our concern is with real ities, not nomenclature. Mofitt v. Kelly, 218 U. S.400,
404, 405; Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S.620,
625, 626; EducationalFilms Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S.379,

387; Lawrence v. State Tax Comm'n, 286 U. S.276, 280.
If the thing here sought to be subjected to taxation is
really an interest in land, then by concession the proposed
tax is not permissible. The suggestion that the record
discloses no federal question is without merit.
Three of the parcels of land lie outside Ohio; four
within; they were severally conveyed to trustees. The
declaration of trust relative to the Clark-Randolph Building Site, Chicago, is typical of those in respect of land
beyond Ohio; the one covering East Sixth Street property, Cleveland, is typical of those where the land lies
in Ohio, except Lincoln Inn Court, Cineinnraf. Each
parcel has been assessed for customary taxes in the name
of legal owner or lessee according to local law, without

deduction or diminution because of any interest claimed
by appellee and others similarly situated.
The trust certificates severally declare-That Max
Senior has purchased and paid for and is the owner of an
undivided 340/1275ths interest in the Lincoln Inn Court
property; that he is registered on the books of the Trustee
as the owner of 5/3250ths of the equitable ownership and
beneficial interest in the Clark Randolph Building Site,
Chicago; that he is the owner of 6/1050ths of the equitable ownership and beneficial interest in the East Sixth
Street property, Cleveland. In each declaration the
Trustee undertakes to hold and manage the property for
the use and benefit of all certificate owners; to collect, and
distribute among them the rents; and in case of sale to
make pro-rata distribution of the proceeds. While certificates and declarations vary in some details, they represent
beneficial interests which, for present purposes, are not
substantially unlike. Each trustee holds only one piece
of land and is free from control by the beneficiaries. They
are not joined with it in management. See Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 147.
The State maintains, that appellant's interest is "a
species of intangible personal property consisting of a
bundle of equitable choses in action because the provisions
of the agreements and declarations of trust of record
herein have indelibly and unequivocally stamped that
character upon it by giving it all the qualities thereof for
purposes of the management and control of the trusts.
At the time the trusts were created, the interests of-all the
beneficiaries consisted merely of a congeries of rights etc.,
and such was the interest acquired by appellant when he
became a party thereto. . . The rights of the beneficiary consist merely of claims against the various trustees
to the pro rata distribution of income, during the continuar ce of the trusts, and to the pro rata distribution of

SENIOR v. BRADEN.

Opinion of the Court.

the proceeds of a sale of the trust estates upon their
termination."
Appellant submit' that ownership of the trust certificate is evidence of his interest in the land,. legal title to
which the trustee holds. This view was definitely accepted by the Attorney General of Ohio in- written opinions Nos. 3640 and 3869 (Opinions 1926, pp. 375, 528)
Wherein he cites*pertinent declarations by the courts of
Ohio and of other states. See also 2 Cincinnati Law
Rev. 255.
The theory entertained by the Supreme Court concerning the nature of appellant's interests is not entirely clear.
The following excerpts are from the headnotes of its opinion which in Ohio constitute the law of the case:
"Land trust certificates in the following trusts. [the
seven described above] are mere evidences of existing
rights to participate in the net rentals of the real estate
being administered by the respective trusts."
"Ascribing to such certificates all possible virtue, the
holder thereof is at best the owner of equitable interests
in real estate divided into shares. evidenced by transferable certificates. Sec. 5323, General Code (114 Ohio Laws
715) does not provide for a tax against the equitable interests in land but does provide a tax against the income
derived from such equitable interests."
Apparently no opinion of any court definitely accepts
the theory now advanced by appellees, but some writers
do give it approval because of supposed consonance with
general legal principles.. The conflicting views are elaborated in articles by Profess6r Scott and Dean Stone in
17 Columbia Law Review (1917) at pp.. 269 and 467.
Maguire v. Trefry, 253 U. S. 12, much relied upon by
appellees, does fibt support their position. There the
Massachusetts statute undertook 'to tax incomes; the securities (personalty) from which the income arose were

held in trust at Philadelphia; income from securities taxable directly to the trustee was not within the statute.
The opinion accepted and followed the doctrine of Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189, and Fidelity & Columbia
Trust Co. v. Louisville, 245 U. S. 54. Those cases were
disapproved by Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota,
280 U. S. 204. They are not in harmony with Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia,280 U. S.83, and views now
accepted here in respect of double taxation. See Baldwin
v. Missouri, 281 U. S.586; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax
Comm'n, 282 U. S. 1; First National Bank v. Maine, 284
U. S.312.
In Brown v. Fletcher, 235 U. S.589, 597, 599, we had
occasion to consider the claim that a beneficial interest in
a trust estate amounts to a chose in action and is not an
interest in the res, subject of .the trust. Through Mr.
Justice Lamar we there said:
"If the trust estate consisted of land it would not be
claimed that a deed conveying seven-tenths interest
therein was a chose in action within the meaning of § 24
of the Judicial Code. If the funds had been invested in
tangible personal property, there is, as pointed out in the
Bushnell case [Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387, 393],
nothing in § j4 to prevent the holder by virtue of a bill
of sale from suing for the 'recovery of the specific thing
or damages for its wrongful caption or detention.' And if
the funds had been cbnverted into cash, it was still so far
property-in fact, instead of in action-that the owner,
so long as the money retained its earmarks, could recover
it or the property into which it can be traced, from those
having notice of the trust. In either case, and whatever
its form, trust property was held by the Trustee,-not in
opposition to the cestui que trust so as to give him a chose
in action, but-in possession for his benefit in accordance
with the terms of the testator's will . ..

STONE,

"The beneficiary here had an interest in and to the
property that was more than a bare right and much more
than a chose in action. For he had an admitted and
recognized fixed right t& the present enjoyment of the
estate with a right to the corpus itself when he reached
the age of fifty-five. His estate in the property thus in
the'possession of the Trustee, for his benefit, though defeasible, was alienable to the same extent as though in
his own possession and passed by deed. -Ham v. Van

instrument by virtue of which that alienation was evidenced,-whether called a, deed, a bill of 'sale, or an
assignment,-was .not a chose in action payable to the
assignee, but an evidence of the assignee's right, title and
estate in and to property."

MR. JUSTICE STONE, dissenting..
I think the judgment should be affirmed.
Tax laws are neither contracts nor penal laws. The
obligation to pay taxes arises from the unilateral action
of government in the exercise of the most plenary of sovereign powers, that to raise revenue to defray the expenses
of government and to distribute the burden among those
who must bear it. See Alabama v. United States, 282

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
SToN.E,

J., dissenting.

295 U. S.

U. S. 502, 507. To that obligation are subject all rights
of persons and property which enjoy the protection of the
sovereign and are within the reach of its power.
For centuries no principle of law has won more ready
or universal acceptance. Even now" that it is doubted,
the doubt is rested on no more substantial foundation
than want of "jurisdiction" to tax, and the assertion that
the Fourteenth Amendment is endowed with a newly discovered efficacy to forbid "double taxation" when the
sovereignty imposing the tax is that of two or more states.
See Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U, S.
-204, 210;, Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, 280 U. S.
83, 92; Baldwin v. Missouri, 281 U. S. 586, 593; compare
Burnet v. Brooks, 288 U. S. 378, 400 et seq. But as no
opinioj "of this Court has undertaken to define the taxation which is thus forbidden because it is double, or to
declare that different legal rights founded upon the same
economic interest may never, under any circumstances, be
compelled to contribute to the cost of government of two
states whpse protection they respectively enjoy, it would
seem still to be open to inquiry whether the particular
tax .now imposed infringes any constitutional principle
capable of statement and definition.
When we speak of the jurisdiction to tax land or a chattel as being exclusively in the state wh6re it is located,
we mean"no more than that, in the ordinary case of owner-ship of tangible property, the legal interests of ownership
enjoy the benefit and protection of the laws of that state
alone, and that it alone can effectively reach the interests
protected for the purpose of subjecting them to the payment -of the tax. Other states are said to be without
jurisdiction, and so without constitutional power to tax.
if they afford no protection to the ownership of the property and cannot lay hold of any interest in the property
in order to compel payment of the tax. See Union Tran-

sit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 195, 202; Frick v. Pennsylvania, 268 U. S. 473, 497.
But when new and different legal interests, however
named, are created with respect to land or a-chattel, of
such a character that they do enjoy the benefits of the
laws of another state and are brought within the. reach of
its taxing power, I know of no articulate principle of law
or of the Fourteenth Amendment" which would deny to
the state the right to tax them. No one would doubt the
constitutional power of a state to tax its residents on their
shares of stock in a foreign corporation whose only property is real estate or chattels located elsewhere, Darnellv.

its only economic source in the value of the land, and the
rights which are elsewhere subjected to the tax can be
brought to their ultimate economic fruition only through
some means of control of the land itself. But the means
of control may be subjected to taxation in the state of its
owner, whether it be a share of stock or a contract or a
mortgage. There is no want of jurisdiction to tax these
interests where they are owned, in the sense that the state

lacks power to appropriate them to the payment of the
tax. No court has condemned such action as capricious,
arbitrary or oppressive. The Fourteenth Amendment
,does not forbid it, -for it is universally recognized that
these interests of them "..ves are in some measure clothed
with the legal incidents of property in the taxinrg state and
enjoy there the benefit and protection of its laws.
Similarly, I do not doubt that a state may tax the income of its citizen derived from land in another state.
The right to impose the tax is founded upon the power to
exact it, coupled with the protection which the state affords to the taxpayer in the receipt and enjoyment of his
income. Lawrence v. State Tax Commn, 286 U. S. 276,
279. I can perceive no more constitutional objection to
imposing such a tax than to the taxation of a citizen on
income derived from a business carried on by the taxpayer
in another state, and subject to taxation there, which we
upheld in Lawrence v. State Tax Comm'n, supra; see
Cook v. Tait, 265 U. S. 47, or to the tax on income derived
from securities having a tax situs in another state, upheld
in Maguire v. Trefry, 253 U. S. 12; see also Fidelity &
Columbia Thust Co. v. Louisville, 245 U. S. 54; compare
DeGanay v. Lederer, 250 U. S. 376. The fact that it is
cnow thought by the Court to be necessary to discredit or
overrule Maguire v. Trefry, supra, in order to overturn
the tax imposed here, should lead us to doubt the result,
rather than the authority which plainly challenges it, and
should give us pause before reading into the Fourteenth
Amendment so serious and novel a restriction on the vital
elements of the taxing power.
The present tax, measured by income, is upon intangible
property interests owned by a citizen of Ohio. They are
represented by transferable certificates, issued) by trustees
of land, under contracts by which each trustee undertakes
to hold the title of specified lands in trust for the benefit
of the certificate holders; to receive the income and to

pay it over to them ratably, after meeting expenses and
depreciation; 'and to receive and distribute ratably the
proceeds of sale of the land if sold under existing options.
In the event of default by the lessee, the trustee is given
plenary authority to terminate the lease, take possession
of the land and sell it, as fully as though it were'thesole
legal and equitable owner. The trustee is authorized to
settle claims upon contract and tort made against the
trustee or the trust estate, and is entitled to indemnity
from the estate for all personal liability and expenses. It
is authorized to borrow money and to give the trust estate
as security.
The beneficiaries have no right to possession or to partition of the property, and can maintain no action at law
with respect to it. They cannot be assessed, and incur no
liability by virtue of the administration of the trust estate.
The trust certificates are freely transferable, as are shares
of stock in a corporation. The rights of the beneficiaries
are so identified with the certificates that they may be
transferred only on surrender of the certificate to the
trustee. Certificates lost, stolen, or destroyed may -be
replaced by the trustee at its option and in its discretion.
Compare Selliger v. Kentucky, 213 U. S. 200, 206.
There is thus created an active trust of land, under,
which the trustee is clothed with all the incidents of legal
ownership, and which is given the status of a business
entity separate and dis' ;nct, for all practical .purposes,
from the interests of the certificate holders. See Crocker
v. Malley, 249 U. S. 223; Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144,
161; Burk-Waggoner Oil Assn. v. Hopkins, 269 U. S. 11Q.
The beneficiaries have none of the incidents of legal own:
ership. They can neither take nor defend possession bf
the land. Bnt they are clothed with rights in personam,
in form both contractual and equitable, enforcible against
the trustee by suit in equity for an accounting, to compel
performance of the trust or to restrain breaches of it.

Such actions are tfansitory and -maintainable wherever
the trustee may be found. Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch
148, 158-160; Beattie v. Johnstone, 8 Hare 169, 177;
Gardnerv. Ogden, 22 N. Y. 327, 333-339.
The owner of the certificates in Ohio is thus vested
with *valuable rights, differing from those of ordinary
ownership, including those enforcible against the trustee
within as well as without the State. They are brought
within the control of the State. ihese rights, the physical certificates with which they are identified, and the
receipt and enjoyment of their income by the owner, are
each protected by Ohio laws. If we look to substance
rather than form, to the principles which underlie and
justify the taxing power, rather than to descriptive terminology which, merely as a matter of convenience, we
may apply to the interest taxed, it would seem to be as
much subject to the taxing power as any other intangible
interest brought within the control and protection of the
State, even though its ultimate economic enjoyment may
be dependent wholly on property located and taxed elsewhere. See Citizens National Bank v. Durr, supra;
Maguirev. Trefry, supra, 16.
' It is unimportant what labels writers on legal theory,
the courts of Ohio, or this Court may place upon this interest. The Fourteenth Amendment did not adopt as
ultimate verities the quaint distinctions taken three centuries ago by Sir Edward Coke between things that savour
of the realty and other forms of right, and between corporeal and incorporeal rights. In applying the Fourteenth Amendment we may recognize, what he failed to
realize, that all rights are incorporeal, and that whether
they are rightly subjected to state taxing power must be
determined by recourse fo the principle upon.which taxes
have universally been laid and collected, rather than by
the choice of a label which, by definition previously agreed
upon, will infallibly mark the interest as non-taxable.

SENIOR v. BRADEN.

STONE, J., dissenting.

In every practical aspect-and taxation is a practical
matter-the trust certificate holder stands in the same
relationship to the land as the stockholder of a land-owning corporatioi. It is not denied that the petitioner receives as much benefit and protection from the State of
Ohio with respect to his'certificates as does the owner of
corporate stock, or that his interest is as much within the
reach of the state power. Only by resort to subtle refinements of legal doctrine, devised without reference to the
problems of taxation and irrelevant to them, or by treating the Fourteenth Amendment as an instrument for giving effect to our own peculiar convictions of what is morally or economically desirable, is it possible to sustain the
taxation of the one and not the other.
Even though the tax be destroyed so far as it is imposed
on petitioner's interest in the trusts of lands outside of
Ohio, it cannot, for any reason advanced to support that
conclusion, be deemed invalid as applied to appellant's
interest in ihe Ohio trusts. The opiniozi of the Court
suggests no other reason.
Whatever name we may give to the interest taxed, Ohio
is not without jurisdiction of the land, the trustee, the
certificates, or the owners of them. All are within the
state. The objection to double taxation by a single sov•ereign is no more potent under the Fourteenth Amendment than the objection that a tax otherwise valid has
been doubled. See Carley & Hamiltonv. Snook, 281 U. S.
66, 72; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40. The
imposition of a tax on a particular interest in land already
taxed ad valorem does not infringe any constitutional immunity. Suiss Oil Corp. v. Shanks, 273 U. S. 407, 413
and cases cited.
The fact that the certificates are taxed, and the owners
of interests in trusts of land not represented by certificates are untaxed, plainly involves no forbidden discrimi-

nation. .The owners of transferable certificates, representing an equitable interest in a trust of land divided
into shares, enjoy privileges and advantages not attaching to other forms of ownership, which are an adequate
basis for a difference in taxation. See Southwestern Oil
Co.v: Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S.232, 237; Home Insurance Co.v. New
York, 134 U. S.594, 606; Brown-FormanCo. v. Kentucky,
217 U. S.563, 572; State Board of Tax Comm'rs v. Jackson, 283 U. S.527, 537.
The judgment now given cannot rest on the Delphic
concession of counsel, that the State has" no power to tax
land or interests in land situate beyond its borders," and
that, if situate within the State, there is no power to tax
them "in any other manner than by uniform rule according to value." The concession, so far as it relates to
the Ohio trusts, plainly has reference to requirements of
the state and not the Federal Constitution. For the Fourteenth Amendment does not restrict a state to the taxation of all interests in land uniformly according to value.
We are not concerned with the validity of the tax under
the state constitution. The state court has plenary power
to settle that question for the litigants and for us, Withers
v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, 89; Pennsylvania College Cases,
13 Wall. 190, 212; Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S.90; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra,119, as it has done by sustaining the tax. No concession of counsel about his
theory of the law requires us to adopt his theory, however mistaken and irrelevant, for decision of the federal question which is alone before us. None can confer on us jurisdiction to review on appeal the decision
of a state question by the highest court of the State, or
excuse the abuse of power involved in our reversing its
judgment on state grounds.
The objections to the tax affecting the Ohio trusts pre
sent no substantial federal question, or any which th(

HERNDON v. GEORGIA.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.
No. 665.

Argued April 12, 1935.-Decided May 20, 1935.

1. An attack upon a statute upon the ground that it is in violation
"of the Constitution of the United States," without further specification, does not raise a federal question. P. 442.
2. A ruling of a state trial court, sustaining an indictment against
preliminary attack, which the Supreme Court of the State declined
to consider because the ruling was not ,preserved in'a bill of exceptions or assigned as error as required by the settled state practice,
can not be considered here upon review of the latter court's judgment, as a basis for raising a federal question. P. 443.
3. An attempt to raise a federal question before a state Supreme
Court upon a petition for*rehearing after judgment, is too late,
unless that court actually entertains the question and decides it.
P. 443.
4. But a federal question first presented to the state, court by
petition for rehearing is in time if it could not have been raised
earlier because the ruling of that court to which it is directed
could not have been anticipated. P. 444.
5. A ruling is not to be regarded as unanticipated by the party
where it is one that follows an earlier decision of the same court
in a similai case. P. 446..
