from regulation by the Congress in respect of matters s~ih
as these, there can be no "code" for it at-All 'Thisis
clear from the provisions of § 7a of the ACt withits explicit
disclosure of the statutory scheme. Wages and the hours
of labor are essential features of the plan, its very bone
and sinew. There is no opportunity in such circumstances
for the severance of the infected parts in the hope of saving the remainder. A code collapses utterly with bone

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS4O
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

kE

No. 717. Argued April 1, 2, 1935.--Decided May:27, 1935.
1. The bankruptcy power, like the other great substantive: powler§ of
Congress, is subject to the Fifth Amendment. P. 589.
2. Under the bankruptcy power, Congress may discharge the odebtor's
personal obligation, because, 'unlike the States, it is not prohibited.
from impairing the obligation of contracts; but it can not 'take ?or
the benefit of the debtor rights in specific property, acquired by
the creditor prior to the Act. P. 589.
3. The Fifth Amendment commands that, however great the Nation's
need, private property shall not be taken even for a wholly public
use without just compensation. P. 602.
4. If the public interest requires, and-permits, the taking of property
of individual mortgagees in order to relieve the necessities of individual mortgagors, resort must be had to proceedings by eminent
domain; so that, through taxation, the burden of' the relief
afforded in the public interest may be borne -by the public.
Pp. 598, 602.
5. The provisions added to § 75 of the Bankruptcy Act by the Act
of June 28, 1934, known as the Frazier-Lemke Act, operate, as
applied in this case, to take valuable rights in specific property
from one person and give them to another, in violation of the
Constitution. P. 601.

295 U. S.

The controlling purpose of this Act.is to preserve to the mortgagor
the ownership and enjoyment .of his farm property. Its avowed
object is to take from the mortgagee rights in the specific property
held as security; and to that end to scale down the indebtedness
to the present value of the property. P. 594.
7. Examination of the measures of relief extended to necessitous
mortgagors by courts of equity and by statute, prior to the FrazierLemke Act, reveals no instance in which the mortgagee was compelled to relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lien
unless the debt was paid in full. P. 579.
8. The right of the mortgagee to insist upon full payment before
giving up his security has been deemed the essence of the mortgage.
To protect this right he is allowed to bid at the judicial sale on
foreclosure. Practically all the measures adopted in the States
for the mortgagor's relief, including moratorium legislation in the
present depression, resulted primarily in a stay, and the relief
rested upon the assumption that no substantive right. of the mortgagee was being impaired, since payment of the debt with interest
would fully compensate him. Cf. Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v.
Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398. P. 580.
9. Although each of our national" bankruptcy Acts followed a major
or minor depression, none had, prior to the Frazier-Lemke Act,
sought to compel a mortgagee to surrender to the bankrupt either
the possession of the mortgaged property or the title, so, long as
any part of the debt remained unpaid, or to supply the bankrupt
with capital with which to engage in business in the future, or to
disturb even a mortgage of exempt property. P. 581.
10. No other bankruptcy Act has undertaken to modify in the interest of the debtor or of other creditors any substantive right of the
holder of any mortgage valid under the federal law. P. 583.
11. In the exercise of the power to marshal liens, sell the property
free, and transfer the lienors' rights to the proceeds of sale, there
has been no suggestion that the sale could be made to the prejudice
of the lienor, in the interest of the debtor or other creditors.
P. 584.
12. A sale free from liens in no way impairs any substantive right
of the mortgdgor, and such a sale is not analogous to the sale to
the bankrupt provided for by Paragraph 7 of the Frazier-Lemke
.Act. P. 585.
13. The provisions of prior bankruptcy Acts concerning compositions
afford no analogy to Paragraph 7 of the Frazier-Lemke Act.

Never, so far as appears, has a composition affected a secured claim
held by a single creditor. P. 585.
14. Although the original purpose of the bankruptcy Acts was the'
equal distribution of the debtor's property among his creditors,
the power is not so limited; and its exercise has broadened, so that
the discharge of the debtor has come to be an object of no less
concern than the distribution of his property. P. 587.
15. The Court has no occasion in this case to decide whether the
bankruptcy clause confers upon Congress, generally, the power to
abridge a mortgagee's rights in specific property, since the FrazierLemke Act deals only with mortgages preexisting. P. 589.
16. A bank, which ten yeari previously had made a long time loan
of $10,000, interest at 6%, secured .by mortgages on a Kentucky
farm then worth presumably twice that sum, was obliged by
defaults to foreclose in a state court. The mortgagor refused. the
bank's offer to take the farm in' satisfaction of the debt, and,
before a judicial sale was ordered, he took advantage of the FrazierLemke Act, meanwhile enacted, and was adjudged a bankrupt.
The bank offered to pay into the bankruptcy court for the property
over $9,000, which, if accepted, would have been returned to the
bank in satisfaction of the debt; but this was refused. The property was appraised at $4,445. Upon the bank's refusing its assent
to a "sale" of the property at that price, by the trustee to the
bankrupt, upon the terms specified in Paragraph 3 of the Act,
the court, proceeding under Paragraph 7, ordered that for a period
of five years all proceedings to enforce the mortgages be stayed;
and that the possession of the property remain in the bankrupt,
"under control of the court," subject only to the payment of an
annual rental to be fixed by the court. The rental for the first
year was fixed at $325, but no other provision was made for taxes,
insurance, and administrative charges. Held:
,(1) That the Act as applied had taken from the bank the following property rights recognized under the law of Kentucky
governing mortgages, viz.: (a) The right to retain the lien until
the indebtedness thereby secured was paid. (b) The right to
realize upon the security by a judicial public sale. (c) The right
to determine when such sale shall be held, subject only to the discretion of the court. (d) The right to protect its interest in the
property by bidding at such sale whenever held, and thus to assure
having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaotion of the debt, either through receipt of the proceeds of a fair

competitive sale or by taking the property itself. (e) The right to
control meanwhile the property during the period of default, subject only to the discretion of the court, and to have the rents
and profits collected by a receiver for the satisfaction of the
debt. ,Pp. 590, 594.
_ (2) :No substitute for these rights is to be found in Paragraph 3
of the Act, which provides that at the request of the bankrupt,
with the assent of the mortgagee, the trustee may make a "sale"
of the property to the bankrupt at its so-called appraised value,
in consideration of the bankrupt's implied agreement to pay 21%
within two years, 2Y% within three years, .5% within five years,
and the balance within six years, with interest on deferred payments at only 1% per annum. P. 591.
(3) No substitute for the rights taken is to be found in Paragraph 7. That section gives the bankrupt, without the mortgagee's
,consent, full possession for five years, with no monetary obligation
beyond paying a reasonable rental fixed by the court. No other
,provision is made for insurance or taxes; and during the extension
the bankrupt has the option of buying the property free, at any
- time, at its appraised or reappraised value; but he need not buy

to the bankrupt, but to a sale made at such time as the latter may
choose. He can not require a reappraisal when, in his judgment,
.the time comes to sell; he may ask for a reappraisal only' if and
when the bankrupt requests a sale. P. 592.
(4) While Paragraph 7 declares that the bankrupt's possession
is "under, the control of the court," this clause gives merely a
supervisory pdwer, which leaves the court powerless to terminate
the bankrupt's option, unless there has been the commission of
waste: or failure to pay the prescribed rent. P. 593.

Messrs. John IVwhom Mr. John, E. Tarrant was on the brief, for petitioner.
The Frazier-Leimke Act is not a law "on the subject
of bankruptcies"; does not deal with any subject over

which power is delegated to Congress; and is, therefore, in
contravention of the Tenth Amendment.
Until this Act, the essential features of bankrirptcy law
were: First, on the part of the debtor-a surrender of
his property and its ratable distribution among his creditors; and, second, on the part of the creditors-discharge
of all claims against the debtor after distribution.
If it be that concentrated in the Federal Government is
the power to control every situation involving non-paying
debtors, then the commercial life of each State is subject,
in large measure, to federal regulation; for example, Congress could divest state courts of jurisdiction over suits
upon promissory notes between citizens of the same State;
commercial controversies arising from breach of contract would fall under a like control; crimes such as the
obtaining of goods or credits by false pretenses could be
defined as crimes against the United States without regard for the powers reserved under the Tenth Amendment to the several States, and, indeed, the lines between
state and federal governments could be largely redrawn.
This all-embracing doctrine is without constitutional basis
and should not, by this Court's sanction, now be written
into the Constitution. United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670.
To effect distribution is the principal object of all
bankruptcy laws, see Straton v. New,"283 U: S. 318, 320;

It was never the purpose of the Frazier-Lemke Act to
distribute the farmer's assets, but only to scale down his
debts, while permitting him to retain his assets. Sen.

May 31, 1934; 78 Cong. Rec., p. 12,297, June 16, 1934.
The Frazier-Lemke Act is bottomed on principles entirely alien to established bankruptcy law. It is specifically directed agaifist mortgagees and other secured creditors, and was enacted for the very purpose of depriving
them of the collateral for which they had bargained and
of giving it to the farmer-debtor. This is clearly shown
by the legislative history of the Act. In re Bradford, 7 F.
Supp. 665, 675.
The Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously relied upon
supposed, analogies to (1) the transfer of a creditor's lien
to the proceeds of sale, and (2) "compositions" binding
non-assenting creditors.
The Frazier-Lemke Act deprived the Land Bank of its
property without due process of law by denying the Bank
its fundamental right to have the mortgaged property
applied to the payment of its debt. The power of Congress to legislate on the "subject of bankruptcies" is subject to the limitations of the Fifth Amendment. Hanover
National Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 192.
The fundamental law vests in a mortgagee the right to
have the mortgaged property devoted exclusively to the
satisfaction of the mortgage debt.
: Congress under the power to pass laws on the subject
of bankruptcies, can impair the obligation of contracts-for such-is the very essence of bankru ptcy law-yet it can
not destroy vested rights of property, contrary to the law
of the land. Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610: In rn Dillard.

655, 662, 664; Ochoa v. Hernandez, 230 U. S. 139, 161.
The Frazier-Lemke Act contains provisions so unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary that the Land Bank
is deprived of its property without due process of-law.
It discriminates between creditors before and after
June 28, 1934, aud between creditors sec ured by exempt
property and those secured by non-exempt property. It
makes no provision for a deficiency claim by the mortgagee against the bankrupt's estate. Interest .on the
mortgage debt is wiped out save for a negligible amount.
The fixing of the value of the debtor's p'roperty'by
appraisal at its "then fair and reasonable value, not necessarily the market value," is arbirtrary, capricious and
unreasonable. All risk of a decline in value is placed on
the creditor.
The arbitrary operation of this Act is illustrated by
the possibility in many cases of a mortgagee or secured
creditor being worse off than the unsecured creditor.
It'also discriminates in the method of procedure as to
the relative rights of secured and unsecured creditors in
electing between (s) (3) and (s) (7); as to the reappraisal provisions; in the absence of any provision for
a reappraisal of personal property pledged or unpledged;
in its rigid fixation of terms by legislative fiat; in the
terms of purchase; and in the tering of possession in
interim.
The discrimination between debts cohtracted prior to
June 28, 1934,, and debts contracted thereafter is a violation 6f the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Bankruptcy is a legal method of dealing with the problems of the depression. See President Hoover's Message,
Feb. 29, 1932, Sen. Doc. 65, 72d Cong., 1st Sess; Report
of the Judicial Conference, October 5, 1931. Congress
enacted several separate acts each dealing with its special
problems arising from this depression. Bankruptcy Act,
§§ 74, 75, 75 (s), 76, 77, 77B, 80. Each is part of the
Bankruptcy Law; and all are to be construed together as
-the complete expressiDn of Congress upon the subject of
bankruptcy'
By a shift in procedure from mere liquidation, which
has proved ruinous because of depression conditions, to
composition, extension, reorganization and rehabilitation,

ble burden of debt, and to discharge the debt6r in a condition, financial and otherwise, to take his place in. his
calling or business.
The use of the power to enact laws on the subject of
bankruptcies to accomplish these purposes is sustained by
the repeated decisions of this Court. Neal v. Clark, 95
U. S. 704; United States v. Fpx, 95 U. S. 670; Traer v.

Many decisions of this Court emphasize the importance
of discharge favorable to resumption of vocation or business. Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 192;

basis for the Act. Home'Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell,

In Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, this Court held that
the great national emergency growing out of a threatened

States, 239 U. S. 510.
Experience has demonstrated that 5 years is not uncommon for an equity receivership. Also- that it takes
substantially as long to administer an estate in bankruptcy as an equity receivership. Under the emergency
conditions, Congress reasonably believed that bankruptcy
cases would not be disposed of as quickly as in normal
times.
That a power of such scope is not limited by the extent
of its previous exercise, and is not exhausted by a partial
exercise, would seem to be self-evident. TaubeZ Co. v.
Fox, 264 U. S. 426.
That Congress had the power to pass the FrazierLemke Amendment to deal with the situation seems to be
clear from the nature and the scope of the power itself.

929; Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum, 293 U. S.
23; Schumacher v. Beeler, 293 U. S. 367.
There is really nothing new in the law in question, except perhaps the application of well settled principles of
bankruptcy law in a novel way. It preserves liens; vests
title to the bankrupt's property in the trustee; and provides for appraisal.
Section 7 provides for a reappraisal at the request of
the lienholder. In such case "the debtor may then pay
the appraised price, if acceptable to the lienholder, into
the court, otherwise the original appraisal price shall be
paid into court." It is clear that this gives the lienholder an option to accept or reject the reappraisal price.
With this option he can take advantage of increase in
value during the 5 year stay period and can not lose
anything by decrease in value during the period. He is
protected against loss in value and given the right to
increases in value.

LOUISVILLE BANK v. RADFORD.
555

Argument for Respondent.

All bankruptcy laws provide for conversion of the
bankrupt's estate into cash and a distribution of the
cash among the creditors as it may appear they are entitled. No law provides that the property as such shall
be distributed, or that a creditor has a right to receive
the property as such. Even in cases in which he is permitted to enforce his lien in the state courts, the creditor
receives the cash proceeds of the sale and not the property.
It may be true that he sometimes bids in the property at
the sale, but in such cases the bid is for cash and the
property applied in payment. Burlinghamv. Crouse, 228
U. S. 459; Williams v. U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co.,
236 U. S. 549, 554-555; Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U. S.
273, 277.
This. law in effect transfers the petitioner's lien from
the property to the proceeds of the property, and compels
the creditor to pursue his remedy in the bankruptcy court
instead of in the state court.
The power to transfer a lien from property to the cash
proceeds of a sale is settled, in bankruptcy and in equity.
Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, 284 U. S. 225. See Bankruptcy Form 44, 172 U. S. 709; FirstNat. Bank v. Shedd,

430-431.
Paragraph 3 is a modified composition. It is purely
voluntary on both sides.
Under § 13 of the Act of 1898 the composition is based
upon voluntary assent so far as concerns the majority of
creditors. It is involuntary in every sense so far as it
concerns the minority. They do not have the right to
refuse to assent even as the lienholder has under the
Frazier-Lemke Amendment, and yet they are bound,this by the will of other creditors. Wilmot v. Mudge, 103
U. S. 217; CumberlandGlass Co. v. DeWitt, 237 U. S. 447;

295 U. 8

Nassau Smelting Works v. Brightwood, 265 U. S. 269.
In so far as this matter is concerned, the law in question uses an old device of bankruptcy law to bring debtor
and creditor together to save the former's property for
him. Under the Act of 1898, § 70 (f), title to the property
revests in the bankrupt upon the confirmation of the
composition provided for in § .12. Under the FrazierLemke Act he becomes an owner by purchase, upon payment of the appraised value.
Paragraph 7 is an alternative in case the lienholder
refuses his assent to a voluntary sale. First, it gives the
bankrupt a right in the nature of an option to repurchase
his property at any time within 5 years by payment into
court of the appraisal price. Upon such payment by the
bankrupt, "the court shall by order turn over full possession and title of said property to the debtor." Secondly,
if the bankrupt fails to comply with the provisions of subsection 7, "the court may order the. trustee to sell the
property as provided in this title." It meets all the requirements of distribution and discharge. It makes certain the liquidation of the estate of the bankrupt so that
distribution can be made. It provides for a sale in any
event for that purpose. This is the limit of the rights of
the creditor in bankruptcy. The time, manner and
method of distribution are legislative and must be determined by Congress.
It is contended, however, that the bankrupt is not
bound to buy during the time he holds possession, and
that the matter of paying the appraisal price into court
is purely optional with him. It is said that the Act confers rights and privileges on the bankrupt without imposing a corresponding liability on his part. The matter is
purely legislative. In the exercise of admitted power, the
legislature may confer such rights and privileges without
imposing corresponding liabilities. Home Bldg. & Loan
Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398.

LOUISVILLE BANK v. RADFORD.

Argument for Respondent.

Such a stay may be regarded as in aid of making a sale
to the bankrupt. Options are commonly used for the purpose of aiding and facilitating sales of property. 'The
delay incident to the stay is no different in its effect 'from
the delay incident to extending credit; yet the latter is a
recognized power in bankruptcy administration. ,- -In any
event, the property is sold. There is authority for holding that the stay in its practical effects is not unlike the
credit extended in Traer v. Clews, 115 U. S. 528, In re
Cope, 8 F. Supp. 778.
It is the underlying principle of bankruptcy that a
debtor may be discharged from his liabilities, after hisproperty has been appropriated by his creditors, without
the assent of his creditors. The application of the principle to a lienholder under the provisions of the law here
in question is no different from the application of it to
minority and non-assenting creditors in cases of composition. In re Reiman, 7 Ben. 455; Wilmot v. Mudge, 103
U. S. 217, 220; Cwmberland Glass Mfg. Co. v. DeWitt,
237 U. S. 447; Nassau Smelting Works v. Brightwood,
265 U. S. 269; In re Mirkus, 289 Fed. 732.
The staying of proceedings in mortgage foreclosure is
an appropriate remedy to protect the rights of the mortgagor under a constitutional statute. Home Bldg. & Loan
Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S.398.
It is permissible in bankruptcy to permit the bankrupt
to remain in possession of the property. Sometimes this
is done in connection with administration until it becomes necessary to assert the rights of the trustee. In
re Reiman, supra; Sparhawk v. Yerkes, 142 U. S. 1, 14;
In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., 180 Fed. 549;
Burlingham v. Crouse, 228 U. S.459.
There is a special reason why a farmer should be permitted to hold possession under the control of the court.

simple and it is an easy matter for the court to exercise

control and supervision over him. Then there is the fundamental reason: after a farmer is dispossessed he is practically impoverished and destroyed and the purposes of
the law will be defeated in such cases.
The sale of the bankrupt's property to the bankrupt
has been approved in many cases. In re Reiman, supra;

In the case of the voluntary proceedings under this
law, the arrangement is one for an extension of credit.
In the case of the proceedings under § 7, the farmer or
bankrupt is given 5 years within which to raise the appraised price of the farm to pay into court to regain full
possession and title. This is the equivalent of an extension of credit. This, too, has been commonly resorted to
in bankruptcy cases. In re Reiman, supra;In re Mirkus,
289 Fed. 732; Traer v. Clews, 115 U. S. 528; In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., 180 Fed. 510; 42 C. J, 202;

The provision for revesting full possession and title in
the farmer bankrupt after he has made his payments in
full under the Frazier-Lemke Amendment is not a new
idea in bankruptcy law. It is used in connection with
compositions under § 12 of the Act of 1898.
The Fifth Amendment does not take away any power
granted to Congress by the Constitution, though it may
in some respect limit the manner in which the power
may be exercised. McCray v. United States, 195 U. S.

Frazier-Lemke Amendment is a bankruptcy law, that settles also the question of whether or not it offends against
the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Cf.

The bankruptcy power includes by necessity the power
to impair the obligation of contracts. Hanover Nat.
Bank v. Moyses, 186 U. S. 181, 188.
The petitioner has no rights in the bankrupt's property
as such. In bankruptcy he has a right only to participate
in the distribution of the bankrupt's esfate after it has
been converted into cash. Congress may legislate upon
this matter and determine the manner and mode and
time of the liquidation.
The bankruptcy proceedings terminate the rights of the
parties as between themselves and place the whole matter in administration in bankruptcy. Petitioner claims
that the denial of the right to foreclose its mortgage on
the bankrupt's property in the state courts is a denial of
due process. But enforcement of liens is a bankruptcy
matter and Congress can confer jurisdiction on courts of
bankruptcy to deal with it. Van Huffel v. Harkelrode.

Argument for Respondent.

The United States is not limited in its enactment of
bankruptcy laws to the English model prevailing in 1789.
Whether or not the moratorium or repurchase privileges
of the Frazier-Lemke Act are so unreasonable 6r arbitrary
as to violate the Fifth Amendment must necessarily depend upon the economic conditions existing at the time
of their enforcement.
Federal courts are bound to take judicial notice of economic conditions. Judicial recognition of economic conditions that inspired this legislation are-,to be found in
Atchison, T. &,S. F. Ry.. Co. v. United States, 284 U. S.
248; Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398;
In re Radford, 8 F. Supp. 489; In re'Cope, 8 F. Supp. 778.
Section 75 (s) is a remedial law and as such is to be
liberally construed to effect its purpose. In re Chicago,
R. I. & P. Ry. Co., 72 F. (2d) 443; In re Landquist, 70 F.
(2d) 929; Smith v. Smith, 7 F. Suppr. 490.
The Act merely affords to the farmer a " long chance"
to reorganize himself. He is afforded no such opportunity
as is any other class covered by the 'bankruptcy law.
The purpose is to keep the farmer on his farm.
Interest on a secured claim stops with the filing of the
petition in bankruptcy. Sexton v. Dreyfus, 219 U. S. 339.
In re Chandler, 184 Fed. 887, 889; In re Orne, Fed. Cas.
No. 10,581; In re J. & S. Ferguson & Lyle, 267 Fed. 817;
In re Vogler, Fed. Cas. No. 16,986.
But under subdivision (7) a secured creditor will obtain
interest. In this respect he is more fortunate than
secured creditors under §§ 77 and 77B.
The "reasonable rental" referred to in § 75 (s) (7)
requires an act of judicial determination, from all the
facts submitted by all interested parties.
It is not unconstitutional to sell, or lease back, to the
farmer, his own property.
The subsections relate to proceedings by consent and can
raise no constitutional question. Generally speaking, the

lienholder can do what it wishes with its own property.
But it is contended that if the lienholder does not consent
to the sale, but objects, then it is mandatory upon the
court to stay all proceedings for 5 years, and rent the
property to the farmer for a "reasonable rental," with
an option to purchase his own property at an appraised
value, subsequently fixed by the court.
When it is considered that the lienholder has no constitutional right to bid in the property; that he has not
even a statutory right at the present time to'his lien, aside
from' the Frazier-Lemke Act, if the court desires to sell
the property free of hens; that the lienholder has no constitutional right to interest after the filing of the petition;
and that he has not even a statutory right to interest
under the present law; it would seem that the constitutionality of the Act is clear, even if every other consideration were swept aside.
What rehabilitates the farmer rejuvenates the Nation.
Emergency- calls forth the exercise of dormant power.
An emergency is here. There is a distinct menace that
ownership of farm lands will pass into the hands of a
privileged few-that the owner-farmer will disappear and
become a hired hand. If this happens, the Republic, as
we know it, and as it was intended to endure, will be at
an end.
Reasonable means are such as are adequate to meet the
emergency while it is in existence, and which enable the
Nation to exist as its founders intended it should.

they made defauit, also, in their covenant to keep the
buildings insured. The Bank urged the Radfords to endeavor to refinance the indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act, May 12,
1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 4.' After they had declined to do so,
the Bank, having declared the entire indebtedness immediately payable, commenced, in June, 1933, a suit in the
Circuit Court for Christian County against the Radfords
and their tenant to foreclose the mortgages; and, invoking
a -covenant in the mortgage expressly providing therefor,
sought the appointment of a receiver to take possession
and control of the premises and to collect the rents and
profits.
The application for the appointment of a receiver was
denied, and all proceedings in the suit were stayed, upon
request of the Conciliation Commissioner for Christian
County appointed under § 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, as
he stated that Radford desired to avail himself of the
proyisions of that section. Proceeding under it, Radford
filed, in the federal court for western Kentucky, a petitiofi

praying that he be afforded an opportunity to effect a
composition of his debts. The petition was promptly
approved and a meeting of the creditors was held. But
Radford failed to obtain the acceptance of the requisite
majority in number and amount to the composition proposed. Then, the Bank offered to accept a deed of the
mortgaged property in full satisfaction of the indebtedness to it and to assume the unpaid taxes. Radford refused to execute the deed; and on June 30, 1934, the
state court entered judgment ordering a.foreclosure sale.
Meanwhile, the Frazier-Lemke Act had been passed on
June 28, 1934; and on August 6, 1934, and again on
November 10, 1934, Radford filed amended petitions for
relief thereunder. The second amended petition prayed
that Radford be adjudged a bankrupt; that his property,
whether free or encumbered, be appraised; and that he
have the relief prcvided for in Paragraphs 3 and 7 of subsection (s) of the Frazier-Lemke Amendment. That Act
provides, among other things, that a farmer who has failed
to obtain the consents requisite to a composition under
§ 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, may, upon being adjudged
a bankrupt, acquire alternative options in respect to
mortgaged property:
1. By Paragraph 3, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee
assents, purchase the property at its then appraised value,
acquiring title thereto as well as immediate possession, by
agreeing to make deferred payments as follows: 21/2 per
cent. within two years; 2 per -cent. within three years;
5 per cent. within 4 years; 5 per cent. within 5 years; the
balance within six years. All deferred payments to bear
interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per; annum.
2. By Paragraph 7, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee
refuses his assent to the immediate purchase on the above
basis, require the bankruptcy court to
"stay all proceedings for a period of five years, during
which five years the debtor shall retain possession of all or

any part of his property, under the control of the court,
provided he pays a reasonable rental annually for that
part of the property of which he retains possession; the
first payment of such rental to be made within six
months of the date of the order staying proceedings, such
rental to be distributed among the secured and unsecured
creditors, as their interests may appear, under the provisions of this Act. At the, end of five years, or prior
thereto, the debtor may pay into court the appraised price
of the property of which he retains possession: Provided,
That upon request of any lien holder on real estate the
court shall cause a reappraisal of such real estate and the
debtor may then pay the reappraised price, if acceptable
to the lien holder, into the court, otherwise the, original
appraisal price shall be paid into court and thereupon the
court shall, by an order, turn over full possession and title
of said property to the debtor and he may apply for his
discharge as provided for by this Act: Provided,however,
That the provisions of this Act shall apply only to debts
existing at the time this Act becomes effective."
Answering the amended petition, the Bank duly claimed
that the Frazier-Lemke Act is, and the relief sought would
be, unconstitutional. It prayed that Radford's amended
petition be dismissed; that the Bank be permitted to pursue its remedies in the state court; and that it be allowed
to proceed with the foreclosure sale in accordance with
the judgment of that court. It refused to accept the composition and extension proposal offered by Radford; declined to consent to the proposed sale of that property to
Radford at the appraised value or any value on the terms
set forth in Paragraph 3; and also objected to his retaining possession thereof with the privilege of purchasing the
same provided by Paragraph 7. The federal court overruled the Bank's objections; denied its prayers; adjudged
Radford a bankrupt within the meaning of the FrazierLemke Act; and appointed a referee to take proceedings

thereunder. There was no claim that the farm was,
exempt as a homestead or otherwise.
The referee ordered an appraisal of all of Radford's
property, encumbered and unencumbered. The appraisers found that " the fair and reasonable value of the property of the debtor on which Louisville Joint Stock Bank
has a mortgage" and also the "market value of said land"
was then $4,445.1 The referee approved the appraisal, although the Bank offered in open court to pay $9,205.09 in
cash for the mortgaged property; and counsel for the
bankrupt admitted that the Bank had a valid lien upon
it for the amount so offered to be paid, and that, under
the law, if the Bank's offer to purchase the property were
accepted, all the money paid in in cash would be inimediately returned to it in satisfaction of the mortgage
indebtedness.
The Bank refused to consent to a sale of the mortgaged
property to Radford at the appraised value and filed
written objections to such sale and to the manner of payments prescribed by Paragraph 3 of sub-section (s).
Thereupon, the referee ordered that, for the period of five
years, all proceedings for the enforcement of the mortgages be stayed; and that the possession of the mortgaged
property, subject to liens, remain in Radford, under the
control of the court, as provided in Paragraph 7 of subsection (s). The referee fixed the rental for the first year
at $325; and ordered that for each subsequent year the
rental be fixed by the court. It was stipulated, that the

$4,445 was the "fair and reasonable value," without mentioning the
market value. It was, by leave of court, amended on December 4,
1934 to read as stated in the text. Besides the mortgaged property,
Radfordhad a one-half interest in a half-acre lot and house thereon
appraised at $150; exempt personal property appraised at $568;
and non-exempt personal property at $831.50. The amount of the

annual taxes and insurance premium amount to $105;
and admitted that administyation charges said to amount
to $22.75 must be paid from the rental. All the orders of
the referee were, upon a petition for a review, duly approved by the District Court; and its decree was affirmed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals on February 11, 1935.
Since entry of the judgment of the Court of Appeals,
this Court has held unconstitutional provisions of state
legislation in some respects comparable to the FrazierLemke Act. W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, ante, p.
56. There we saiol: "With studied indifference to the
interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate protection
they have taken from the mortgage the quality of an
acceptable investment for a rational investor "; and, "So
viewed they are seen to be an oppressive and unnecessary
destruction of nearly all the incidents that give attractiveness and value to collateral security." The Bank insists, among other things, that the Frazier-Lemke Act
has been here applied with like result; that the provisions
of the Act, even if applied solely to mortgages thereafter
executed, would transcend the bankruptcy power; and
that, in any event, to apply them to preexisting mortgages
violates the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Radford contends that the Frazier-Lemke Act is
valid because it is a proper exercise of the power conferred by Article I, § 8 of the Constitution, which declares:
"Congress shall have Power . . . To establish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the
United States." Before discussing these contentions, it
will be helpful to consider the position occupied generally
by mortgagee prior to the enactment here challenged.
First. For centuries efforts to protect necessitous mortgagors have been persistent. Gradually the mortgage of
real estate was transformed from a conveyance upon condition into a lien; and failure of the mortgagor to pay on
the day fixed ceased to effect an automatic foreclosure.

LOUISVILLE BANK v. RADFORD.
555

Opinioi of the Court.

Courts of equity, applying their established jurisdiction
to relieve against penalties and forfeitures, created the
equity of redemption. Thus the mortgagor was given a
reasonable time to cure the default and to require a reconveyance of the property. Legislation in many states carried this development further, and preserved the mortgagor's right to possession, even after default, until-the

command that the mortgagor should not lose his property on default had always rested on the assumption that

the mortgagee would be compensated for the default by
a later payment, with interest, of the debt for which the
security was given; and the protection afforded the mortgagor was, in effect, the granting of a stay. No instance

has been found, except under the Frazier-Lemke Act, of
either a statute or decision compelling the mortgagee to

relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lien
unless the debt was paid in full.'

can redeem from the mortgagee. only on paying the entire mortgage

waived by him, applies even when the redeemer has an interest in
only part of the mortgaged property. Bank' of Luvern& v. Turk,

Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

This right of the mortgagee to insist upon full, payment
before giving up his security has been deemed of the essence of a mortgage. His.position in this respect was not
changed when foreclosure by public sale superseded strict
foreclosure or when the legislatures of many states created a right of redemption at the sale price. To protect
his right to full payment or the mortgaged property, the
mortgagee was allowed to bid at the judicial sale on foreclosure.' In many states other statutory changes were

statute the general rule that a mortgagee, exercising a power of sale
conferred in the mortgage, may not purchase at his own sale. See

made in the form and detail of foreclosure and redemption.' But practically always the measures adopted for
the mortgagor's relief, including moratorium legislation,
enacted by the several states during the present depression, 10 resulted primarily in a stay; and the relief afforded
rested, as theretofore, upon the assumption that no substantive right of the mortgagee was being impaired, since
payment in full of the debt with interest would fully compensate him.
Statutes for the relief of mortgagors, when applied to
preexisting mortgages, have given rise, from time to time,
to serious constitutional questions. The statutes were
sustained by this Court when, as in Home Building &
Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S.398, they were found to
preserve substantially the right of the mortgagee to obtain, through application of the security, payment of the
indebtedness. They. were stricken down, as in W. B.
Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, ante, p. 56, when it appeared that this substantive right was substantially
abridged. Compare W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, 292

to the Frazier-Lemke amendment, sought to compel the
holder of a mortgage to surrender to the bankrupt either
the possession of the mortgaged property or the title, so
long as any part of the debt thereby secured remained unpaid. The earlier bankruptcy acts created some exemptions of unencumbered property;1 2 but none had attempted to enlarge the rights or privileges of the mortgagor as against the mortgagee. The provisions of the
acts, so far as concerned the debtor, were aimed to "relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive
indebtedness and permit him to start afresh free from
the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes," and to give him " a new opportunity
in life and a clear field for-future effort, unhampered by
the pressure of discouragement and preexisting debt."
Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 244. No bankruptcy act had undertaken to supply him capital with
which to engage in business in the future. Some States
ad granted to debtors extensive exemptions of unencumbered property from liability to seizure in satisfaction of debts; and these exemptions were recogniged by
the bankruptcy act of 1867, as well as that of 1898. But

prove in bankruptcy for the full amount of the debt, a

to the Civil War. The fourth Bankruptcy Act, July 1, 1898, c. 541,

brought within the scope of our bankruptcy laws by the Act of
1841, which made voluntary bankruptcy available to all. In the Act
of 1867, farmers were not, as in the Act of 1898, excluded from
involuntary bankruptcy.

mortgage even of exempt property was not disturbed by
bankruptcy proceedings. Long v. Bullard, 117 U. S.
617.2
No bankruptcy act had undertaken to modify in the
interest of either the debtor or other creditors any substantive right of the holder of a mortgage valid under
federal law. Supervening bankruptcy had, in the interest of other creaitors, affected in some respects the remedies available to lien holders. In Continental Illinois
NationalBank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co.,
294 U. S. 648, where, in a proceed;ug for reorganization of
a railroad under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the District
Court was held to have the power to enjoin temporarily
the sale of pledged securities, this Court said: "The injunction here in no way impairs the lien, or disturbs the
preferred rank of the pledgees. It does no more than
suspend the enforcement of the lien by a sale of the collateral pending further action. It may be, as suggested,
that during the period of restraint the collateral will decline in value; but the same may be said in respect of an
injunction against the sale of real estate upon foreclosure
of a mortgage; and such an injunction may issue in an
ordinary proceeding in bankruptcy. Straton v. New, 283
U. S. 318, 321, and cases cited." (p. 676.) "The injunction here goes no further than to delay the enforcement
of the contract. It affects only the remedy." (p. 681.)
Bankruptcy acts had, either expressly, or by implication, as was held in Van'Huffel v. Harkelrode, 284 U. S.
225, 227, authorized the court to direct, in the interest of
other creditors, that all liens upon property forming a
part of t~e bankiupt's estate, be marshalled; that the
property le sold free of encumbrances; and that the

rights of all lienholders be transferred to the proceeds of
the sale-a power which "had long been exercised by federal courts sitting in equity when ordering sales by receivers or on foreclosure." FirstNational Bank v. Shedd, 121

U. S. 352, 367. Compare Ray v. Norseworthy, 23 Wall.
128, 135. But there had been no suggestion that such
a sale could be made to the prejudice of the lienor, in the
interest of either the debtor or of other creditors. By the
settled practice, a sale 'free of liens will not be ordered by
the bankruptcy court if- it appears that the amount of
the encumbrance exceeds the value of the property."'
And the sale is always made so as to obtain for the property the highest possible price. No court appears ever to
have authorized a sale at a price less than that which the
lien creditor offered to pay for the property in cash. 1

Thus, a sale free of liens in no way impairs any substantive right of the mortgagor; and such a sale is not
analogous to the sale to the bankrupt provided for by
Paragraph 7 of the Frazier-Lemke Act.
Nor do the provisions of the bankruptcy acts concerning compositions afford any analogy to the provisions of
Paragraph 7. So far as concerns the debtor, the composition is an agreement with the creditors in lieu of a distribution of the property in bankruptcy-an agreement
which "originates in a voluntary offer by the bankrupt,and results in the main, from voluntary acceptance by
Nassau Smelting & Refining Works v.
his creditors."
Brightwood Bronze Foundry Co., 265 U. S. 269, 271;
Myers v. International Trust Co., 273 U. S.380, 383. So
far as concerns dissenting creditors, the composition is a
method of adjusting among creditors rights in property in
which all are interested. In ordering the adjustment, the
bankruptcy court exercises a pQwer similar to that long
exercised by courts of law, Head v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., 113 U. S.9,21; and of admiralty, The Steamboat Orleansv. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175, 183. It is the same
power, which a court of equity exercises when it compels
dissenting creditors, in effect, to submit to a plan of reorganization approved by it as beneficial and assented to
by the requisite majority of the creditors. Shaw v. Railroad Co., 100 U. S. 605; Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v.

tion is desired by the requisite majority and is approved
by the court. 6 Never, so far as appears, has any composition affected a secured claim held by a single creditor.
Compositions are comparable tQ the-voluntary adjustment
with the mortgagee provided for in Paragraph 3 of the
Frazier-Lemke amendment. They are not analogous to
the so-called adjustment compelled by Paragraph 7.
Third. The Bank contends that the Frazier-Lemke Act
is void, because it is not a law "on the subject of Bankruptcies "; that it does not deal with that subject; and
hence that it is in contavention of the Tenth Amendment,
which declares: "The powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by -it to the
States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the
people." The argument is that thi essential features of a
bankruptcy law are these: the surrender by the debtor of
his property for ratable distribution among his creditors,
except so far as encumbered or exempt, and the discharge
by his creditors of all claims against the debtor; that, on
the other hand, the main purpose, and the'effect, of the
Frazier-Lemke Act is to prevent distribution of the farmermortgagor's property; to enable him to remain in possession despite persisting default; to scale down the mortgage debt; and to give the mortgagor the option to acquire
the full title to the property upon paying the reduced
amount. Thus, it is urged, the Act effects a fundamental
change in the relative rights of mortgagor and mortgagee
"The principle of composition was first applied to the interests of
secured creditors in their security, by § 74, added to the Bankruptcy
Act by Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, § 1, 47 Stat. 1467 (individual
debtors); by § 75, Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, § 1, 47 Stat. 1470

and by § 80, Act of May 24, 1934, c. 345, 48 Stat. 798 (public

of real property as determined by the law of the State in
which the property is located. •The Bank argues that if
the bankruptcy clause were construed to permit the making of such fundamental changes Congress could deal with
every phase of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying debtor and his creditors; that it might, among
other things, divest state courts of jurisdiction over suits
upon promissory notes between citizens of the same State;
that commercial controversies arising from breach of contract might be brought under like control; that the.obtaining of goods or credits by false pretences, for example,
could be made a crime against the United States, despite
the rule declared in United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670;
that the commercial and financial life of each State would
be in large measure subject to federal regulation; and
that the lines between State and Federal Government
could thus be redrawn by Congress.
It is true that the original purpose of our bankruptcy
acts was the equal distribution of the debtor's property
among his creditors; and that the aim of the legislation
was to do this promptly." But, the scope of the bankruptcy power conferred upon Congress is not necessarily
limited to that which has been exercised. The first act
provided only for compulsory proceedings against traders,

It is true that the position of a secured creditor, who

has rights in specific property, differs fundamentally from
that of an unsecured creditor, who has none; and that the

oft-quoted definitions of the bankruptcy power indicate

its broad scope. When in In re Klein (reported in a note to Nelson
v. Carland, 1 How. 265, 277) the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy
Act of 1841 was challenged because it brought within its scope insolvent debtors other than traders and provided for voluntary proceeding,.Mr. Justice Catron, sitting in Circuit said: "I hold it [the
bankruptcy power] extends to all cases where the law causes to be
distributed the property of the debtor among his creditors; this is
its least limit. Its greatest is a discharge of the debtor from his contracts. And all intermediate legislation, affecting substance and form,
but tending to further the great end of the subject-distribution and
discharge---are in the competency and discretion of Congress." Judge
Blatchford when sustaining the provision for composition in In re
Reiman, Fed. Cas. No. 11,673, p. 496, said that the subject of bankruptcy cannot properly be defined as "anything less than the subject
of the relations between an insolvent or non-paying or fraudulent
debtor, and his creditors, extending to his and their relief." And
Mr. Justice Hunt, sitting in that case, on appeal to the Circuit
Court said that "whatever relates to the subject of bankruptcy is
within the jurisdiction of congress." Fed. Cas. No. 11,675, p. 601.

589

Opinion of the Court.

Frazier-Lemke Act is the first instance ol an attempt, by
a bankruptcy act, to abridge, solely in the interest of the
mortgagor, a substantive right of the mortgageb in specific property held as security. But we have no occasion
to decide in this case whether the bankruptcy clause confers upon Congress generally the power to abridge the
mortgagee's rights in specific property. Paragraph 7 declares that "the provisions of this Act shall apply only
to debts existing at the time this Act becomes effective."
The power over property pledged as security after the
date of the Act may be greater than over property pledged
before; and this Act deals only with preexisting niortgages. Because the Act is retroactive in terms and as
here applied purports to take away rights of the mortgagee in specific property, another provision of the Constitution is controlling.
Fourth. The bankruptcy power, like the other great
substantive powers of Congress, is subject to the Fifth
Amendment."9 Under the bankruptcy power Congress
may discharge the debtor's personal obligation, because,
unlike the States, it is not prohibited from impairing the
obligation of contracts. Compare Mitchell v. Clark,, 110
U. S.633, 643. But the effect of theAct here complained
of is not the discharge of Radford's personal obligation,;For instance, the war power, Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 119;

It is the taking of substantive rights in specific property
acquired by the Bank prior to the Act. In order to determine whether rights of that nature have been taken, we
must ascertain what the mortgagee's rights were before
the passage of the Act.. We turn, therefore, first to the
law of the State.
Under the law of Kentucky, a mortgage creates a lien
which may be foreclosed only by suit resulting in a judicial
sale of the property. Civil Code of Practice, § § 375, 376;
Insurance Co. of North America v. Cheatham, 221 Ky.
668, 672; 299 .S.W-. 545. While mere default does not
entitle the mortgagee to possession, Neuport & Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Douglass, 12 Bush 673, 705, § 299 of the
Code provides that, in an action for the sale of mortgaged
property a receiver may be appointed if it appears "that
the property is probably.insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt," Mortgage Union v. King, 245 Ky. 691; 54
S. W. (2d) 49; and where there is (as here) a pledge in the
m~rtgage of 'rents, issues and profits, and provision for
appointment of a receiver, the mortgagee is entitled as of
right to have a receiver appointed to collect them for his
benefit, Brasfield & Son v. Northwestern Mutual Life
Ins. Co., 233 Ky. 94; 25 S.W. (2d) 72; Watt's Administrator v. Smith, 250 Ky. 617, 630; 63 S. W. (2d) 796.
Under § 374 of the Code a sale may be ordered at any
time after default. Under Carroll's Stat. (1930), §§ 2362,
2364, there must be an appraisal before the sale; and if
the sale brings less than two-thirds of the appraised value
the mortgagor may redeem within a year by paying the
original purchase money and interest at 10 per cent. But
inadequacy of price is not alone ground for setting aside
a sale. Kentucky Joint Land Bank v. Fitzpatrick,237 Ky.
624; 36,S. W. (2d) 25. No--provision permits the mortgagor to obtain a release or surrender of the property
before foreclosure without paying in full the indebtedness
secured. Nor does any provision prohibit a mortggee

LOUISVILLE BANK v. RADFORD.

Opinion of the Court.

from protecting his interest in the property by-bidding at
the foreclosure sale. Thus, the controlling puipos&of the
law of Kentucky was and is that mortgaged property shall
be devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt
secured; and the provisions of its law are appropriate to.
ensure that result.
For the rights acquired and possessed by the mortgagee
under the law of Kentucky, the Act substituted only the
following alternatives:
(A) Under Paragraph 3, the mortgagee may,. if the
bankrupt so requests, assent to a 'o-called sale by the
trustee to the bankrupt at a so-called, appraised value;
and upon such assent an implied promise arises to purchase the property on the terms prescribed in that Paragraph. But, the transaction would not confer upon the
mortgagee the ordinary fruits of an immediate sale; nor
would the agreement of sale, if performed by the bankrupt, result in payment at the appraised value. The
mortgagee would not get the ordinary friits of an immediate sale on deferred payments; for the bankrupt would
make no down payment at the time of taking possession
and would give no other assurance that the payments
promised would in fact be made. And, if all such payments were duly made, the sale.would not be -at the. appraised value; for the value of money (even if there were
no risk) is obviously more than one per cent. 20 By restricting, throughout the period of six years, the annual
interest on the deferred payments to one per cent., a sai6
at much less than the appraised value is prescribed. The
aggregate payments of principal and interest prescribed
would in no year before.the end of the sixth be as much
"In no state of the Union, in 1921, was the maximum lawful rate
of interest less than 6 per cent. per annum; and in only two states was
the legal rate as low as 5 per cent. Ryan, Usury and Usury Laws
(1924), pp. 28-31. In Kentucky, 6 per cent. is both.the legal and the
lawful rate. Carroll's Ky. Stat. (1933), §§ 2218, 2219.

592

Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

as six per cent. on the appraised value.21 Moreover, before any deferred payment of the purchase price is made,
there is serious danger that the Bank's investment might
be further impaired. The mortgaged property might be
lessened in value by waste. It might. become burdened
with the liens for accruing unpaid taxes; 22 for, while interest at the rate of 1 per cent. of the appraised value of
the Radford farm is $4.45, the present annual taxes
(plus insurance premium) are, as stipulated, $105. Thus
if the alternative offered by Paragraph 3 were accepted,
the transaction would result merely in a transfer of possession to the' bankrupt for six years with an otherwise
unsecured promise to purchase at the end of the period
for a price less than the appraised value.
(B) If the mortgagee refuses to consent to the agreement to sell under Paragraph 3, he is compelled, by Paragraph 7, to surrender to the bankrupt possession of the
property for the period of five years; and during those

on the appraised value. The prescribed payment for the second year
is 3% per cent. thereof (1 per cent. for interest, 2A per cent. on account of principal). The prescribed payment for the third year is
22h per cent. of the principal and as interest 1 per cent. on 97 1/, per
cent. of the prinqipal. The prescribed payment for the fourth year is
5 pe dent. on account of the principal and as interest, 1 per cent. on

year is 5 per cent. on account of principal, and as interest, 1 per cent.
on 90 per cent. of the principal. The prescribed payment at the end
of the sixth year is 85 per cent. of the principal, and as interest 1 per
cent. of 85 per cent. of the principal. The present value calculated
on a 6 per cent. basis, of all deferred payments (principal and interest) would be only 76.6 per cent. of the appraised value. In other
words, the agreement to sell if assented to by the mortgagee would
,require him to relinquish his security not for its appraised value in
cash, but for deferred payments which, if met, would yield (on a. 6
per cent. basis) only 76.6 per cent. pf the appraised value.

years, the bankrupt's only monetary obligation is to pay
a reasonable rental fixed by the court. There is no provision for the payment of insurance or taxes, save as these
may be paid from the rental received. During tharperiod
the bankrupt has an option to purchase the farm at any
time at its appraised, or reappraised, value. 3 The mortgagee is aot only compelled to submit to the sale to the
bankrupt, but to a sale made af such time as the latter
may choose. Thus, the bankrupt may leave it uncertain
for years whether he will purchase; and in the.end he
may decline to buy. Meanwhile the mortgagee may have
had (and been obliged to decline) an offer from some
other person to take the farm at a price sufficient to satisfy the full amount then due b'y the debtor. The mortgagee cannot require a reappraisal when, in its judgment,
the time comes to sell; ,it may ask for a reappraisal only
if and when the bankrupt requests a sale. Thus the
mortgagee is afforded no protection if the request is made
when values are depressed to a point lower than the original appraisal. While Paragraph 7 declares that the bankrupt's poisession is "under the control of the court," this
clause gives merely supervisory power. Such control
leaves the court powerless to terminate the option unless
there has been the commission of waste or failure to pay
the prescribed rent.
This is the construction given to Paragraph 7 by both of the
lower courts, by both of the parties in their briefs and oral arguments
here, and, so far as appears, by all other courts and judges that have
passed upon the Act, except District Judge Lindley, who, .in In re
Miner, 9 F. Supp. 1, held that Paragraph 7, as well as Paragraph 3,
was conditioned upon the moftgagee's consent to a sale to the debtor
at the appraised value. See- also John Hanna,'Agriculture and the
Bankruptcy Act, 19 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 19, 20; Report of Judiciary
Committee, No. 370, p. 2, 74th Congress, 1st Session, April 1, 1935,

Fifth. The controlling purpose of the Act is to preserve
to the mortgagor the ownership and enjoyment of the
farm property. It does not seek primarily a discharge of
all personal obligaions--a function with which alone
bankruptcy acts have heretofore dealt. Nor does it make
provision of that nature by prohibiting, limiting or postponing deficiency judgments, as do some State laws.24
Its avowed object is to take from the mortgagee rights in
the specific property held as security; and to that end
"to scale down the indebtedness" to the present value
of fhe property. 5 As here applied it has taken from the
Bank the following property rights recognized by the Law
of Kentucky:
1. The right to retain the lien until the indebtedness
thereby secured is paid.
2. The right to realize upon the -security by a judicial
public sale.
3. The right to determine when such sale shall be held,
subject only to the discretion of the court.
4. The right to protect its interest in the property by
bidding at such sale whenever held, and thus to assure
having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the
satisfaction of the debt, either through receipt of the pro"This has been dopne by recent state legislation. Compare Arizona,

5. The right to control meanwhile the property during"
the period of default, subject only.to the discretion of the
court, and to have the rents and profits collected by a
receiver for the satisfaction of the debt.
Strong evidence that the taking of these rights from
the mortgagee effects a substantial impairment -of the
security is furnished by the occurrences in the Senate
which led to the adoption there of the amendment to the
bill declaring that the Act " shall apply only to debts
existing at the time this Act becomes effective." The bill
as passed by the House applied to both preexisting and
future mortgages. It was amended in 'the Senate so as
to limit it to existing mortgages; and as so amended was
adopted by both Houses pursuant to the reporf of the
Conference Committee. 6 , This was done because, in the
Senate, it was pointed out that the bill, if made applicable
to future mortgages, would destroy the -farmer's future
mortgage credit."
See Conference Report, June 18, 1934, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 78
Cong. Rec., pp. 12,376, 12,491.
"Senator Bankhead said: "If it applied only to existing mortgages, I should be glad to support it; but here is a program presented,
not limited to existing mortgages, but a permanent program for the
composition of mortgages. When a farmer goes to his advancing

merchant, or goes to his banker, or applies to an insurance company"
for a loan under this bill, I want to know, and I am enquiring with
earnest anxiety about it, what effect is it going to have upon those
credit facilities for the farmers of this country." Id., p. 12,074. Senator Fess: "It does seem to me that we might destroy the
credit which he insists the'farmers have, because everyone realizes
that by the passage of this bill we may be making it impossible fothe farmer in the future to borrow money." Id., p. 12,075.
Representative Peyser expressed the same view: "I believe that
many of the Members are overlooking" a very vital point in connection with this legislation-that is the fact that you are removing from

Sixth. , Radford contends that these changes in the position of the Bank wrought pursuant to the Act, do not
impair substantive rights, because the Bank retains every
right in the property to which it is entitled. The contention rests upon the unfounded assertion that its only substantive right under the mortgage is to have the value of
the security applied to the satisfaction of the debt. It
would be more accurate to say that the only right under
the mortgage left to the Bank is the,right to retain its lien
until the mortgagor; sometime within the five-year period,
chooses to release it by paying the appraised value of the
property. A mortgage lien so limited in character and
incident is of course legally conceivable. It might be
created by contract under existing law.2 8 If a part of the
mortgaged property were taken by eminent domain 29a
mortgagee would receive payment on a similar basis.
But the Frazier-Lemke Act. does not purport to exercise
the right of eminent domain; and neither the law of Kentucky nor Radford's mortgages contain any provision conferring upon the mortgagor an option to compel, at any
time within five years, a release of the farm upon payment of its appraised value and a right to retain meanwhile possession, upon paying a rental to be fixed by the
bankruptcy courts.
Equally unfounded is the contention that the mortgagee
is not injured by the denial of possession for the five years,
the farmer the possibility of securing any mortgage assistance in the
future. I believe in the enactment of this law and the scaling down
of values you are going to take away the possibility of help that may
be needed by these farmers in the future." Id., p. 12,137.
uMany instances can be tound of m6rtgages which provide that
parcels of the mortgaged property shall -be released upon payment of
fixed amounts or upon payment of their value upon an appraisal
therein provided for.

since it receives the rental value of the property."o It is
argued that experience has proved that five years is not
unreasonably long, since a longer period is commonly
required to complete a voluntary contract for the sale and
purchase of a farm; or to close a bankruptcy estate; or to
close a railroad receivership. And it is asserted that Radford is, in effect, acting as receiver for the bankruptcy
court. Radford's argument ignores the fact that in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings ahd in equity receiverships,
the court may in its discretion, order an immediate sale
and closing of the estate; and it ignores, also, the fundamental difference in purpose between the delay permitted
in those proceedings and that prescribed by Congress.
When a court of equity allows a receivership to continue,
it does so to prevent a sacrifice of the creditor's interest.
Under the Act, the purpose of the delay in making a sale
and of the prolonged possession accorded the mortgagor
is to promote his interests at the expense of the
mortgagee. "
Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398,
upon which Radford relies, lends no-support to his contention. There the statute left the period of the extension
of the right of redemption to be determined by the court
within the maximum limit of two years. Even after the
Counsel for the debtor suggests that the reasonable rental provided for in Paragraph 7, is more than the secured creditor ordinarily
receives in bankruptcy, since interest on secured as well as unsecured
claims ceases with the filing of the petition. But the rule relied upon
applies only when the secured creditor, having realized upon his
security, is seeking as a general creditor to prove for the deficiency
against the bankrupt estate. Sexton v. Dreyfus, 219 U. S. 339. It
has no application when the mortgagee has a preferred claim against
proceeds realized by the trustee from a sale of the security free of
liens. Coder v. Arts, 213 U. S. 223, 228, 245, affirming 152 Fed. 943,

period had been decided upon, it could, as was pointed out,
"be reduced by order of the court under the statute, in
case of a change in circumstances, . ." (p. 447); and
at the close of the period, the mortgagee was free to apply
the mortgaged property to the satisfaction of the mortgage
debt.' Here, the option and the possession would continue
although the emergency which isrelied upon as justifying
the Act ended before November 30, 1939."'
Seventh. Radford contends further that the changes in
the mortgagee's rights in the property, even if substantial,
are not arbitrary and unreasonable, because they were
made for a permissible public purpose. That claim appears to rest primarily upon the following propositions:
(1) The welfare of the Nation demands that our farms be
individually owned by those who operate them. (2) To
permit widespread foreclosure of farm mortgages would
result in transferring ownership, in large measure, to great
corporations; would transform farmer-owners into tenants
or farm laborers; and would tend to create a peasant class.
(3) There was grave danger at the time of the passage of
the Art, that foreclosure of farms would become widespread. The persistent decline in theprices of agricultural
products, as compared with the prices of articles which
farmers are obliged to purchase, had been accentuated by
the long continued depression and had made it impossible
"As by § 75 the petition of the farmer-mortgagor'may be filed at
any time within five years after March 3, 1933, and the period of the
possession and of the option extends for five years, the provision
might bar enforcement of an existing mortgage until 1943.
Counsel for Radford contends that the five year provision of Paragraph 7 is not inflexible, because, under the rule of Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543, it would cease to be effective on
the termination of the emergency which is relied upon to justify the
Act. But the Act does not make the five year option period dependent upon the continuance of a national emergency; 'and the options conferred upon the farmer-owner show"that it was the needs of

the particular debtor to which consideration was given.

Opinion of the Court.

for farmers to pay the charges accruing under existing
mortgages. (4) Thus had 'arisen ,an emergency requiring
congressional action. To avert the threatened calamity
the Act presented an appropriate remedy. Extensive economic data, of which in large part we may take judicial
notice, were submitted in support of these propositions.
The Bank calls attention, among other things, to the
fact 'that the Act is not limited to mortgages of farms
operated by, the owners; that the finding of the lower
courts that Radford is a farmer within the meaning of the
Act does not necessarily imply that he operates his farm;
and that at least part of it must have been rented to another, since a tenant is joined as defendant in the foreclosure suit. Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act (to which
this Act is an amendment), provides in sub-section (r)
that "the term 'farmer' means any individual who is
personally bona fide engaged primarily in farming operations or the principal part of whose income is derived
from farming operations." Thus, the Act affords relief
not only to those owners who operate their farms, but
also to all individual landlords the "principal part- of
whose income is derived" from the "farming operations "
of share croppers or other tenants; and, among these landlords, to persons who are. merely capitalist absentees.3 2

295 U. S.:

It has been suggested that the number of farms operated by. tenants was very large before the present depression; " that the increase of tenancy had been progressive
for more than half a century; "' that the increase has not
been attributable, in the main, to foreclosures; 11 and that,
in some of the older farming regions. Thus in eastern North Dakota
40 per cent. of the tenant farms were owned by landlords not residing
in the same county and the proportion is nearly as large in central
Kansas and in Oklahoma." Id., p. 535.
' Of the 6,288,648 farms in 1930, 42.4 per cent. were operated by
tenants. The percentage in Kentucky operated by tenants was 35.9
per cent.; in Iowa, 47.3 per cent.; in Georgia, 68.2 per cent. In the
South, 1,790,783 families were working as tenant farmers. See Hearings, March 5, 1935, on S. 2367, the Bill to create the Farm Tenant

"During the half century prior to the present business depression,
every decennial census recorded a progressive increase in farm tenancy.
Of the 4,008,907 farms in'the United States in 1880, 25.6 per cent.
were operated hy tenants; of the 6,448,343 farms in 1920, 38.1 per
cent. were operated by tenants. Farm Tenure, Census of 1920,
Agriculture, Vol. V, p. 133, T. 11. The percentage of improved farm
land operated by owners in 1920 was only 46.8. Farm Ownership &
Tenancy, Yearbook of Agriculture (1923), p. 509.
' " Causes underlying this upward trend of tenancy are complex
and obscure. The trend has apparently continued through the various shades of adversity and prosperity. Farms operated by managers are not classed with tenancy. As has been pointed out before,
the best, most productive lands have the greatest tenancy. Apparently tenancy does not thrive on poor lands. It is hardly thinkable
that high productiveness'is a result of tenancy. It is a fact, however, that the largest up-trend in the yield of corn per acre is in the
area of greatest tenancy." Iowa Year Book of Agriculture (1931),
p. 349. In Iowa, 1927, tenant operated acres were 53.9 per cent. of
the total acres in farms. In 1930 the percentage was 54.; in 1931,

Opinion of the Court.

in some regions, the increase in tenancy has been marked
during the period when farm incomes were large and farm
values, farm taxes and farm mortgages were rising
rapidly.36
We have no occasion to consider either the causes or
the extent of farm tenancy; or whether its progressive increase would be arrested by the provisions of the Act.
Nor need we consider the occupations of the beneficiaries
of the legislation. These are matters for the consideration
of Congress; and the extensive provision for the refinancing of farm mortgages which Congress has already
made, shows that the gravity of the situation has been
appreciated.
The province of the Court is limited to
deciding whether the Frazier-Lemke Act as applied has
taken from the Bank without compensation, and given
to Radford, rights in specific property which are of substantial value. Compare Ochoa v. Hernandez, 230 U. S.
139, 161; Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, 662,
664; In re Dillard, Fed. Cas. No. 3,912, p. 706. As we
conclude that the Act as applied has done so, we must
"The increase in tenancy in the West North Central States is
without doubt the result of the price situation. Land bought in the
period of high prices could not be paid for, with the result that it is
now operated by tenants." Yearbook of Agriculture, 1932, p. 494.
From 1910 to 1920, farm mortgage debt increased from $3,320,470,000
to $7,857,700,000. See The Farm Debt Problem, House Doc. No. 9,
p. 5, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. In 1910 the total acreage of farm land was
878,798,325; in 1920, it was 955,883,715. Census of 1920, Agriculture, Vol. V, p. 32, T. 3. The greatly increased local tax rate, in
connection with increased land values, has been suggested as being an
important cause of increasing farm tenancy. Hearings on S. 2367;
p. 16. The average value of farm property per acre in 1880, was
$22.72; in 1920, $81.52; in 1930, $58.01. Census of 1930, Agriculture, Vol. II, p-10, T. I. Farm property taxes in 1910 amounted to'

office. Held that Congress intended to restrict the power of removal to one or more of those causes. Shurtleff v. United States,

2. This construction of the Act is confirmed by a consideration of
the character of the Commission-an independent, non-partisan
body of experts, charged with duties neither political nor executive,
but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative; and by the
legislative history of the Act. P. 624.
3. When Congress provides for the appointment of officers whose
functions, like those of the Federal Trade Commissioners, are of
legislative and judicial quality, rather than executive, and limits
the grounds upon which they may be removed from office, the
