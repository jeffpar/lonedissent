KELLY v. GRIFFIN, JAILER OF LAKE COUNTY,
ILLINOIS.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 777. Argued April 6, 7, 1916.-Decided April 17, 1916.
That the arrest by state or municipal authorities is illegal does not
affect the jurisdiction of a United States Extradition Commissioner.
The omission of a formal act of release of one held under an illegal
arrest by state authorities and of a subsequent formal and legal
arrest thereafter by a United States Marshal under an extradition
warrant held, under the circumstances of this case, not to furnish
grounds for release on habeas corpus, it not appearing that a different rule applies in the demanding country.
In this case held that the complaint charging the person demanded
with having committed in Canada perjury, obtaining money under
false pretenses and receiving stolen property, states offenses of perjury and obtaining money by false pretenses within the meaning of
the extradition provisions of the treaty with Great Britain both in
Canada where the offenses were committed, and in Illinois where
the person demanded was arrested; but quwre whether it does
state an offense of receiving stolen property which is a crime in both
jurisdictions.
Where the complaint properly charges an offense included in the extradition treaty and also charges one that is not included, the court
will not release on habeas corpus, but will presume that the demanding country will respect an existing treaty and only try the person
surrendered on the offenses on which extradition is allowed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of an order for
extradition under the treaties with Great Britain, are
stated in the opinion.

241 V. S.

Argument for Appelant.

The United States Commissioner did not have jurisdiction of the person of appellant.
Appellant's arrest and detention without warrant were
unlawful. Rev. Stat., § 5270; Ex parte Cohen, 8 Can. Cr.
Cas. 312; Re Dickey, Id. 318; State v. Shelton, 79 N. Car.
605, 607-608; Malcolmson v. Scott, 56 Michigan, 459; Scott
v. Eldridge, 154 Massachusetts, 25; Harris v. Louisville
&c. Ry., 35 Fed. Rep. 116; Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S.487.
Appellant could not lawfully be turned over by the
Chicago police officers to, or be lawfully taken from them
by the United States marshal. He should have been set
at liberty from such illegal arrest and detention before he
could be lawfully arrested on the Commissioner's warrant.
Ex parte Cohen, supra; Hooper v. Lane, 6 H. L. Cas. 443;
Mandeville v. Guernsey, 51 Barb. 99.
The enactment by the Parliament of the Dominion of
Canada of a statute which gives to a different moral
offense, which is not a crime in Illinois or in the United
States or at common law,-the name of a crime mentioned
in an extradition treaty with Great Britain does not
bring such different moral offense within the provisions of
the treaty.
Such an enactment, however, has been made in the
Criminal Code of Canada, and it is under it that the
extradition of the petitioner for perjury is sought.
By the common law, by the statutes of the United
States and by the statutes of Illinois, where the petitioner
was seized, a false statement under oath to be "perjury"
must be material to the issue pending. Coke 3d Inst. 167;
Archbold's Cr. P1. Ev. & Pr., 24th ed. 1160; R. v. Townsend, 10 Cox, 356; § 225, Crim. Code Illinois; § 125, Crim.
Code U. S.
By the statutes of Canada "perjury" is a false statement under oath in a judicial proceeding whether said
statement is material or not. This makes the offense
against the laws of Canada, there denominated "per-

jury"-an entirely different thing from the crime of
"perjury" known to the common law, to the statutes of
Illiiiois, or to the statutes of the United States.
The extraditable crime named in the Convention of
1889, enlarging the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, as
"perjury," is the common-law crime of "perjury," the
definition of which is the same as that given of "perjury"
in the statutes of Illinois and of the United States and of
the United Kingdom. Ch. 6 of 1 & 2, Geo. V.
By indirection in 1869 and directly in 1892 and again in
1906, the Dominion Parliament denominated as "perjury" a moral dereliction which was not and is not
a crime at common law, nor by the statutes either of
Great Britain or of the United States or of any of them.
This did not affect the meaning of the term "perjury"
as used in the Convention of 1889. Statutes of Canada,
1869, Ch. 23, 32-33 V.; 1886, Ch. 154, § 5; 1892, Ch. 2955 & 56 V.; 1906, Ch. 146, § 170.
Not only must an offense be named in the treaty as
extraditable, it. must also be considered a crime in both
the demanding and surrendering country. Wright v.
Henkel, 190 U. S. 58.
Thus the offense denominated "perjury" in Canada is
not in the United States a crime.
It is not an answer that the Commissioner or court in
the United States might have considered the false statement probably material to the matter under investigation
by the Canadian Committee.
If extradited for "perjury" the petitioner may be tried
and condemned in Canada without proof or in the face of
disproof of that which constitutes "perjury" in the United
States. It is impossible to extradite for "perjury" from
the United States to Canada and avoid this situation.
Extradition from the United States to Canada for this
alleged crime is therefore not permissible. United States v.
Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407.

241 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

The alleged false statement of appellant on which the
charge of perjury is based was not under oath.
The Public Accounts Committee was without.power or
authority to examine him under oath, with respect to the
matter testified about.
The tribunal must have had jurisdiction of the cause in
which the oath was administered, and this committee
lacked that jurisdiction. People v. Pankey, 1 Scam. 80;
Maynard v. People, 135 Illinois, 416; Hereford v. People,
197 Illinois, 222.
The complaints and the competent evidence before the
Commissioner did not show probable cause that appellant
was guilty of' the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses-(1) under the law of Canada; and (23) under the
law of Illinois. Crim. Code Canada, § 404; Rev. Stat.
Illinois, Ch. 38, § B 16; Jackson v. People, 122 Illinois, 139,
149; Moore v. People, 190 id. 333, 335.
The complaints and the competent evidence before the
Commissioner did not show probable cause of the commission by appellant of the crime of embezzlement, or
larceny or receiving of money, valuable securities or other
property, knowing the same to have been embezzled,
stolen or fraudulently obtained.

not unlawful. Yordi v. Nolte, 215 U. S. 227.

It is not material what the Canadian statute of perjury
is if the perjury charged comes within the terms of the
Treaty and United States law. Grin v. Shine, 187 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellant was held for extradition to Canada and
petitioned for and obtained a writ of habeas corpus. After
a hearing upon the returns to the writ and to a writ of certiorari issued to the Commissioner by whose warrant the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

petitioner was detained, the District Judge discharged the
writ. An appeal was allowed and several objections have
been pressed to the proceeding, which we will take up in
turn. The matter arises out of frauds in the construction
of the new parliament buildings at Winnipeg, in which
Kelly the contractor and a number of public men are
alleged to have been involved.
.First it is said that jurisdiction of the appellant's person
has not been obtained legally. On October 1, 1915, he was
arrested without a warrant, on a telegram from Winnipeg.
The next day a complaint was made before the Commissioner by the British Vice-Consul General in Chicago upon
information and belief, a warrant was issued, and the
petitioner was turned over to the United States Marshal
by the Chicago police. On October 15 a new complaint
was filed by the British Consul General, a new warrant was
placed in the hands of the marshal .and the former complaint was dismissed. Wright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 42,
44, 63. The contention is that the original arrest was illegal and that. the appellant was entitled to be set at liberty
before the warrant of October 2 or that of October 15
could be executed with effect.
But however illegal the arrest by the Chicago police it
does not follow that the taking of the appellant's body by
the marshal under the warrant of October 2 was void.
The action of the officers of the State or city did not affect
the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the United States.
Furthermore the order dismissing the complaint of October 2 was that the appellant be discharged forthwith from
custody; so that on the face of the record it would seem
that before being held under the present warrant the
appellant had the moment of freedom which he contends
was his right. It is urged that the Canadian authorities
are trying to take advantage of their own wrong. But
the appellant came within reach of the Commissioner's
warrant by his own choice, and the most that can be said

KELLY v. GRIFFIN.
241 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

is that the effective exercise of authority was made easier
by what had been done. It was not even argued that the
appellant was entitled to a chance to escape before either
of the warrants could beexecuted. This proceeding is not
a fox hunt. But merely to be declared free in a room with
the marshal standing at the door having another warrant
in his hand would be an empty form. We are of opinion
that in the circumstances of this case as we have stated
them the omission of a formal act of release and a subsequent arrest, if they were omitted, furnishes no ground for

discharging the appellant upon habeas corpus. All the
intimations and decisions of this Court indicate that the

detention of the appellant cannot be declared void. Pettibone v. Nichols, 203 U. S. 192. lasigi v. Van De Carr, 166

U. S. 391, 393, 394. Ekiu v. United States, 142 U. S. 651,
662. If we were satisfied that a different rule would be
applied by the final authority in Great Britain other questions would arise. Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447. But
we are not convinced by anything that we read in Hooper
v. Lane, 6 H. L. C. 443, that a different rule would be
applied and we think it unnecessary to discuss the differences in detail.
The complaint of October 15 charges perjury, obtaining
money by false pretenses, and, conjointly, stealing or
embezzling and unlawfully receiving money and other
property of the King which had been embezzled, stolen
or fraudulently obtained by means of a conspiracy as set
forth. The perjury alleged is swearing falsely to the proportion of cement sand and broken stone put into the
caissons of the new parliament buildings at Winnipeg, in a
judicial proceeding before the Public Accounts Committee
of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba,
the appellant knowing his statements to be false. It is
objected that although perjury is mentioned as a ground
for extradition in the treaty, the appellant should not be
surrendered because the Canadian Criminal Code, § 170,

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

defines perjury as covering false evidence in a judicial proceeding 'whether such evidence is material or not.' As
to this it is enough to say that the assertions charged
here were material in a high degree and that the treaty
is not to be made a dead letter because some possible
false statements might fall within the Canadian law that
perhaps would not be perjury by the law of Illinois. "It
is enough if the particular variety was criminal in both
jurisdictions." Wright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 60, 61.
There is no attempt to go beyond the principle common to
both places in the present case. It is objected further that
although the above committee was authorized to examine
witnesses upon oath it was only in 'such matters and things
as may be referred to them by the House.' But even if
there were not some evidence and a finding, Ornelas v.
Ruiz, 161 U. S. 502, 509, the nature of the investigation,
the purposes for which the committee was appointed, and
the fact that the appellant appeared before it without
objection would warrant a presumption of regularity in a
summary proceeding like this.
The plan for the foundations of the buildings was
changed from piling called for by the written contract to
caissons filled with concrete and the false representations
alleged concern the amount of concrete, lumber, iron
rings and bolts used in the extra work. They consisted
in bills or 'progress estimates' addressed to the Provincial
Government for 'labor and materials supplied,' setting
forth the amount of each item thus stated to have been
supplied. It is objected that the amounts demanded by
the bills were paid not upon the bills but upon vouchers
coming from the Department of Public Works, and that
the provincial architect who certified the bills was not
deceived. The person who made out the certificates
relied upon the bills in good faith, and it appears that
without the bills the payments would not have been made.
The fact that there were other steps necessary in addition

KELLY v. GRIFFIN.
241 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to sending in a false account, or that other conspirators
coiperated in the fraud, does not affect the result that on
the evidence Kelly obtained the money from the Provincial Government by fraudulent representations to which
he was a party and that his false statement was the foundation upon which the Government was deceived.
The last charge, stealing or embezzling and receiving
money fraudulently obtained needs a word of explanation.
It may be assumed that there is no evidence of larceny
or embezzlement as (commonly) defined, but the receiving
of property known to have been fraudulently obtained is
a crime by the laws of both Canada and Illinois. There
may be a doubt whether the appellant, if a party to the
fraud, received the money of the Government directly
from it, or through a third hand so as to be guilty under
this count of the complaint. We are not prepared to
pronounce his detention upon the count unjustifiable
in view of the finding. We assume, of course, that the
Government in Canada will respect the convention between the United States and Great Britain and will not try
the appellant upon other charges than those upon which
the extradition is allowed. Therefore we do not think
it necessary to require a modification of the complaint
before the order discharging the writ of habeas corpus is
affirmed.
Finalorder affirmed.
