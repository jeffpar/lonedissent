OCTOBER TERM, e.915.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

241 U. S.

BR AZEE v. PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
MICHIGAN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.

No. 402. Argued April 6, 1916.-Decided May 22, 1916.
A State, exercising its police power, may require licenses for employment agencies and prescribe reasonable regulations in respect to
them to be enforced according to the legal discretion of a commissioner.
The provisions in Public Act No. 301 of Michigan of 1913, imposing a
license fee to operate employment agencies and prohibiting employment agents from sending applicants to an employer who has
not applied for labor, are not unconstitutional as depriving one
operating an employment agency of his property without due process
of law or as denying him the equal protection of the laws.
Provisions in the statute limiting fees that may be charged by those
licensed thereunder are severable, and might, if unconstitutional,
be eliminated without destroying the statute.
The validity of severable provisions of the statute involved in this
case not having been raised by the charge against one violating it,
and not having been considered by the court below, has not been
considered by this court.
183 Michigan, 259, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the Fourteenth Amendment of Public Act No. 301 of
1913 of Michigan, imposing licenses on the conducting of
employment agencies, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Proctor Knott Owens for plaintiff in error:
The provision in § 5 of the statute is unconstitutional
in that it abridges the right and liberty to contract, and is
a denial of due process of law. The whole act is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The penalty provisions of the statute are unconetitutional,

Mr. Grant Fellows, Attorney General of the State of
Michigan, with whom Mr. David H. Crowley was on the
brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
court.
Brazee having taken out a license to conduct an employment agency in Detroit under Act 301, Public Acts
of Michigan, 1913, was thereafter convicted upon a charge
of violating its provisions by sending one seeking employment to an employer who had not applied for help. He
claimed the statute was invalid upon its face because in

conflict with both state and Federal Constitutions, and
lost in both trial and Supreme Courts. 183 Michigan, 259.
Now he insists it offends that portion of the Fourteenth
Amendment which declares, "'No State shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any
State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
The general purpose of the act is well expressed in its
title-" An Act to provide for the licensing, bonding and
regulation of private employment agencies, the limiting
of the amount of the fee charged by such agencies, the
refunding of such fees in certain cases, the imposing of
obligations on persons, firms or corporations which have
induced workmen to travel in the hope of securing employment, charging the Commissioner of Labor with the
enforcement of this act and empowering him to make
rules and regulations, and fixing penalties for the violation
hereof." It provides: Sec. 1. No private employment
agency shall operate without a license from the Commissioner of Labor, the fee for which is fixed at $25 per
annum except in cities over two hundred thousand population, where it is $100; this license may be revoked for
cause; the Commissioner is charged with enforcement of
the act and given power to make necessary rules and regulations. Sec. 2. A surety bond in the penal sum of one
thousand dollars shall be furnished by each applicant.
Sec. 3. Every agency shall keep a register of its patrons
and transactions. Sec. 4. Receipts containing full information regarding the transactions shall be issued to all
persons seeking employment who have paid fees. Sec. 5.
"The entire fee or fees for the procuring of one situation
or job and for all expenses, incidental thereto, to be received by any employment agency, from any applicant for
employment at any time, whether for registration or other

BRAZEE v. MICHIGAN.

Opinion of the Court.

purposes, shall not exceed ten per cent. of the first month's
wages;" no registration fee shall exceed one dollar and in
certain contingencies one-half of this must be returned.
Sec. 6. "No employment agent or agency shall send an
applicant for employment to an employer who has not
applied to such agent or agency for help or labor;" nor
fraudulently deceive any applicant for help, etc. Sec. 7.
No agency shall direct any applicant to an immoral resort
or be conducted where intoxicating liquors are sold.
Sec. 8. Violations of the act are declared to be misdemeanors and punishment is prescribed.
The Supreme Court of Michigan held "the business is
one properly subject to police regulation and control;"
the prescribed license fee is not excessive; provisions of
the state constitution in respect of local legislation are not
infringed; and no arbitrary powers judicial in character
are conferred on the Commissioner of Labor. But it did
not specifically rule concerning the validity of limitations
upon charges for services specified by § 5.
Considering our former opinions it seems clear that
without violating the Federal Constitution a State, exercising its police power, may require licenses for employment agencies and prescribe reasonable regulations in
respect of them to be enforced according to the legal discretion of a commissioner. The general nature of the
business is such that unless regulated many persons may
be exposed to misfortunes against which the legislature
can properly protect them. Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S.

sought to be enforced against plaintiff in error the act in
question infringes no provision of the Federal Constitution. The charge relates only to the plainly mischievous
action denounced by § 6. Provisions of § 5 in respect
of fees to be demanded or retained are severable from
other portions of the act and, we think, might be eliminated without destroying it. Their validity was not
passed upon by the Supreme Court of the State and has
not been considered by us.
The judgment of the court below is
Affirmed.

SPOKANE & INLAND EMPIRE RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 136. Submitted December 15, 1915.-Decided June 5, 1916.
Exceptions from the general policy which the law embodies are to be
strictly construed, hnd are to be so interpreted as not to destroy the
remedial purpose intended.
The exception contained in § 6 of the Safety Appliance Act of March 2,
1893, as amended April 1, 1896, and March 2, 1903, exempting from
its operation cars which are used upon street railways, does not
exempt cars used in regular interstate traffic which are also to some
extent used on street railways. Such cars are covered by the general
provisions of the statute.
Cars used on an electric railway doing an interstate business on a
standard gauge track according to standard railroad rules held, in
this case, to be subject to the Safety Appliance Acts in regard to
grab-irons and hand-holds, notwithstanding they were used at the
terminals of the roads upon street railways.
The Safety Appliance Acts may not be violated with impunity by
omitting grab-irons and hand-holds from cars because the railroad
