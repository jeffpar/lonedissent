CHES. & OHIO RY. v. GAINEY.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. $.

Mr. E. L. Worthington, Mr. W. D. Cochran, Mr. LeWright Browning and Mr. P. K. Malin for plaintiff in
error. I
Mr. R. S. Dinkle and Mr. Watt M. Prichard for defendant in error:
Complaint that certain phraseology used in the measure
of damage instruction was misleading is without merit,
because it is evident that plaintiff in error was not prejudiced thereby.
Present cash value theory knot correct in principle and
has never been sanctioned by the Supreme Court of the
United States or lower Federal courts. C. & 0. Ry. Co. v.
Kelly's Admr., 160 Kentucky, 296.
There was no substantial error in the measure of damage
instruction, as a consideration of it as a whole shows
clearly that the jury were limited to finding the" pecuniary
loss" to the dependent beneficiary.
If errors were in the measure of damage. instruction,
same were invited by plaintiff in error and were not properly preserved as ground of error either under the state
practice or the practice of this court. L. & N. Ry. Co. v.
Woodford, 153 S. W. Rep. 722; 156 Kentucky, 398; Patterson v. Moss, 97 S. W. Rep. 397; 30 Ky. L. R. 10; L.

See note on p. 212, ante.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

1910 (c. 149, 35 Stat. 65; c. 143, 36 Stat. 291). It was
brought to recover damages for the death of Richard
Dwyer, caused by the negligence of the railroad company,
while he was in its employ in interstate commerce. The
sole beneficiary was decedent's widow, who originally
qualified as administratrix and brought the action, but
has died since the allowance of the present writ of error.
Laying aside a contention based upon the Seventh
Amendment to the Federal Constitution, which has been
disposed of in Minneapolis& St. Louis R. R. v. Bombolis,
ante, p. 211, the only question raised relates to the method
adopted in ascertaining the damages. The jury returned
a verdict for $16,000. On appeal to the Kentucky Court
of Appeals it was insisted that this amount was grossly
excessive, and was the result of erroneous instructions
to the jury. It was contended that the verdict of $16,000
if placed at interest would yield an annual income greater
than the amount the widow would have received had
she lived, and would yet leave her the principal to dispose of at the time of her death. The court overruled
this contention, on the authority of Ches. & Ohio Ry. v.
Kelly's Admx., 160 Kentucky, 296, where the same court
held that in such a case the whole loss is sustained at
the time of intestate's death, and is to be included in the
verdict without rebate or discount. A reading of the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the present case (162 Kentucky, 427) makes it evident that it was only upon this
theory that the court was able to reach a conclusion sustaining the verdict. Since we have held, in Ches. & Ohio
Ry. v. Kelly, Admx., this day decided, ante, p. 485, that
the theory is erroneous, it results that the judgment here
under review must be
Reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
