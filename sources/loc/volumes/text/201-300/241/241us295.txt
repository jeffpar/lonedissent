points. They involve an appreciation of all the evidence
and the inferences which admissibly might be drawn
therefrom; and it suffices to say that we find no such_
clear or certain error as would justify disturbing the concurring conclusions of the two courts upon these questions. Great Northern Ry. v. Knapp, 240 U. S. 464; Baugham v. New York &c. Ry. (decided this day, ante, p. 237).
Complaint also is made of the instructions given upon
the measure of damages. The criticism is directed against
mere fragments of this part of the charge, and the objections made at the time were not such as were calculated
to draw the trial court's attention to the particular complaint now urged. The inaccuracies were not grave and
the charge as a whole was calculated to give the jury a
fair understanding of the subject. The defendant therefore is not in a position to press the complaint, especially
as it was not dealt with in the opinion of the appellate
court. See Magniac v. Thompson, 7 Pet. 348, 390; McDermott v. Severe, 202 U. S. 600, 610; Illinois Central

BANKERS TRUST COMPANY v. TEXAS AND
PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 889.

Argued April 12, 13, 1916.-Decided May 22, 1916.

In a suit brought by a corporation existing under the laws of New York
and therefore a citizen of that State, against the Texas & Pacific
Railway Company, incorporated and existing under an act of Congress and certain supplemental and amendatory acts, held that:
The provision in § 1 of the act of 1871 under which the Texas & Pacific

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Syllabus.

241 U.'S.

Railway was incorporated, that such company may sue and be sued
in all courts of law and equity within the United States, was not
intended to confer jurisdiction upon any particular court, but merely
to render the company capable of suing and being sued in any court
whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate
to the occasion.
It is reasonable to presume that if Congress has the purpose to take a
class of suits out of usual jurisdictional restrictions relating thereto,
it will make its purpose plain.
Under the Constitution, Congress possesses power to invest subordinate
Federal courts with original jurisdiction of suits at law or equity
arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States
and this power has been exercised at various times. Such jurisdiction has by § 24, Judicial Code, been given to and is now vested in,
the District Courts subject to a restriction as to the amount in
controversy.
A corporation chartered by an act of Congress is not only a creature of
that law, but all its rights are dependent thereon and a suit by or
against such a corporation is one arising under a law of the United
States.
Section 5 of the act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, 38 Stat. 583, providing
that no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any
suit by or against any railroad company on the ground that it was
incorporated under an act of Congress, is amendatory of the Judicial
Code and renders the fact of incorporation under an act of Congress
a negligible factor in determining whether a suit by or against a
railroad company is one arising under a law of the United States
so as to give the District Court jurisdiction thereof.
A corporation, such as the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, incorporated under acts of Congress, and whose activities and operations
are not by its charter confined to any State, but are intended to be,
and are, carried on in different States, is not a citizen of a State
within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute.
While such a corporation is a citizen of the United States in the sense
that a corporation organized under the law of a State is a citizen
of that State, it is not within the declaration of the Fourteenth
Amendment that native born and naturalized citizens of the United
States are citizens of the State in which they reside.
Congress has not clothed railroad corporations organized under acts
of Congress with state citizenship for jurisdictional purposes as it
has done in respect to National banks.
A suit by a citizen of a State against a railroad corporation organized

and existing under an act of Congress is not a suit between citizens
of different States of which the District Court has jurisdiction under
§ 24, Judicial Code, as amended by the act of January 28, 1915.
THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court of a suit against a corporation incorporated by a
statute of the United States, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Maurice E. Locke, with whom Mr. William W.
Green was on the brief, for appellant:

The history of the passage of § 5 of the act of January 28, 1915, shows that Congress intended to take away
from ,the Federal courts only their jurisdiction of the litigations of railroad companies restifg 'upon the ground
that such companies were incorporated under act of Congress, or in other words only such jurisdiction as was dependent upon the existence of a constructive Federal
question arising from the mere fact of Federal incorporation.
For the purpose of ascertaining the intent of Congress
it is proper to consider the development of the act itself,
the reports of committees relative thereto, and other
similarly definite and reliable indicia. Holy Trinity Church
v. United States, 143 U. S. 457; Binns v. United States,

It also is proper in interpreting a statute to consider the
environment, the history of the times, and the particular
evil which was pressing upon the attention of Congress,
and for which it was seeking a remedy. For this purpose

the court may avail itself of all accessible sources of information, including the proceedings and debates in
Congress. Cases supra and Standard Oil Co. v. United

There is jurisdiction by reason of the Federal questions
which exist and give rise to Federal jurisdiction, unless
Federal jurisdiction has been taken away by the act of
1915 which has not been the case.
A suit to enforce a railroad mortgage given by a federally
chartered company necessarily involves one or more Federal questions that are not merely constructive in their
character.
A railroad company has only such power to mortgage
its property essential to the performance of its public
duties as its charter and other governing laws confer expressly or by necessary implication. Jones on Corporate
Bonds, §§ 1-4; Baldwin on American R. R. Law, 463;
Commonwealth v. Smith, 10 Allen, 448.
That this is a suit to enforce a railway mortgage is
either shown by express averment or judicially noticed by
the court and is an essential element of the plaintiff's bill.

The validity and effect of the various provisions of the
mortgage must be determined with reference to the acts
of 1873 and 1874, which are not acts of incorporation.
The court has jurisdiction of this cause on the ground
of diversity of citizenship, which is sufficiently shown by
the record. The absence of a direct averment that it is
a citizen of Texas is immaterial, since all the facts are
alleged from which citizenship appears as the necessary
legal intendment. Sun Printing Assn. v. Edwards, 194

As it is a citizen of the United States and a resident of

This is a suit to foreclose a railroad mortgage and for
other incidental relief. It was brought in the District
Court for the Northern District of Texas December 27,
1915, was dismissed by that court for want of jurisdiction
and is here upon a direct appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code.
The bill alleges that the plaintiff, the trustee under the
mortgage, is a New York corporation and "a citizen of
said State"; that the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, one of the defendants, is a corporation created and
existing under the laws of the United States, has its principal place of business and its principal operating and
general offices in the Northern District of Texas, and
"is a resident and inhabitant" of that district; that the
New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, the other de-

fendant, is a Louisiana corporation and "a citizen of said
State"; that one of the acts of Congress under which the
Texas and Pacific Railway Company was created and
now exists (act March 3, 1871, c. 122, § 1, 16 Stat. 573)
provides that such company "by that name
shall be able to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded,
defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity
within the United States"; that under that act and
designated amendatory and supplemental acts of Congress (May 2, 1872, c. 132, 17 Stat. 5Q; March 3, 1873,
c. 257, 17 Stat. 598; June 22, 1874, c. 406, 18 Stat. 197)
said company came to own and hold on February 1, 1888,
certain railroad properties and interests in Texas and
Louisiana; that on that date said company, "acting in
pursuance of due authority conferred upon it by said
acts of Congress", the relevant portions of which are
copied into the bill, and the New Orleans Pacific Railway
Company, acting in pursuance of authority conferred
upon it by the laws of Louisiana, executed and delivered
the mortgage in suit covering these railroad properties
and interests, a substantial part of which is situate in
the Northern District of Texas; that the mortgage was
duly filed and recorded in the Department of the Interior
pursuant to such acts of Congress; that the mortgagors
have defaulted in the performance of the terms and conditions of the mortgage, and that the suit involves the
requisite jurisdictional amount and "arises under the
Constitution and laws of the United States."
By a motion to dismiss the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company challenged the jurisdiction of the District
Court upon the grounds that the act of January 28, 1915,
c. 22, § 5, 38 Stat. 803, provides: "No court of the United
States shall have jurisdiction of any action or suit by or
against any railroad company upon the ground that said
railroad company was incorporated under an act of Congress," and that apart from the Texas and Pacific Rail-

Opinion of the Court.

way Company's incorporation under congressional enactments the suit is not one arising under the Constitution
or any law of the United States, and is not one between
citizens of different States. The motion was sustained
and the bill was dismissed as to both defendants.
The plaintiff insists that in refusing to entertain the
suit the District Court erred because (1) the provision
before quoted from § 1 of the act of March 3, 1871, enables the Texas and Pacific Railway Company to sue
and be sued in any court of law or equity within the
United States; (2) the bill shows that the suit is one
arising under the laws of the United States apart from
the incorporation of the. Texas and Pacific Railway Company under acts of Congress, and therefore the act of
January 28, 1915, is not controlling, and (3) the bill shows
that the suit is between citizens of different States.
1. Upon reading § 1 of the act of 1871 it is plain that
the words "by that name . . . shall be able to sue
and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity within the United
States" were not intended in themselves to confer jurisdiction upon any court. As the context shows, Congress
was not then concerned with the jurisdiction
of courts
but with the faculties and powers of the corporation which
it was creating; and evidently all that was intended was
to render this corporation capable of suing and being
sued by its corporate name in any court of law or equityFederal, state or territorial-whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate to the occasion.
Had there been a purpose to take suits by and against the
corporation out of the usual jurisdictional restrictions
relating to the nature of the suit, the amount in controversy and the venue, it seems reasonable to believe
that Congress would have expressed that purpose in altogether different words. The case of Bank of the United
States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61, 85, is well in point, A

provision in the act incorporating the bank, c. 10, §3,
1 Stat. 191, much like that here relied upon, was invoked
as in itself entitling the bank to sue in a Circuit Court of
the United States, but that view was rejected in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, wherein it was said:
"That act creates the corporation, gives it capacity to
make contracts and to acquire property, and enables it
'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and
be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record,
or any other place whatsoever.' This power, if not incident to a corporation, is conferred by every incorporating act, and is not understood to enlarge the jurisdiction
of any particular court, but to give a capacity to the corporation to appear, as a corporation, in any court which
would, by law, have cognizance of the same, if brought by
individuals. If jurisdiction is given by this clause to
the Federal courts, it is equally given to all courts having
original jurisdiction, and for all sums however small they
may be."
Afterwards, when the second bank of the United States
was established, a provision was inserted in the incorporating act, c. 44, § 7, 3 Stat. 266, enabling the bank
to sue and be sued "in all state courts having competent
jurisdiction, and in any Circuit Court of the United
States," and in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9
Wheat. 738, it was held (pp. 816-818) that this provision,
unlike that in the prior act, amounted to an express grant
of jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts and (pp. 823, et seq.)
was within the power of Congress under the Constitution.
It was in the light of these differing precedents in legislation and of the resulting difference in their interpretation
that Congress framed the act of 1871. While that act
does not literally follow either precedent, its words have
the same generality and natural import as did those in
the earlier bank act, and this strengthens the conclusion
that Congress intended thereby to give to the Texas and

BANKERS TRUST CO. v. TEX. & PAC. RY.
241 U. S.

305

Opinion of the Court.

Pacific Railway Company only a general capacity to sue
and be sued in courts of law and equity whose jurisdiction
as otherwise defined was appropriate to the occasion, and
not to establish an exceptional or privileged jurisdiction.
2. Under the Constitution Congress undoubtedly possesses power to invest the, subordinate Federal courts
with original jurisdiction of all suits at law or in equity
arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the
United States, and, if the act of February 13, 1801, c. 4,
§ 11, 2 Stat. 89, be not noticed because of its early repeal,
c. 8, § 1, 2 Stat. 132, it is true, as sometimes has been
said,1 that this power was broadly exercised for the first
time by the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, § 1, 18 Stat. 470.
By that act Congress in express terms gave the Circuit
Courts original jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts
of the several States, of all suits of that nature, where the
value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, was in
excess of five hundred dollars, and this jurisdiction remained with the Circuit Courts until January 1, 1912,
when they were abolished, save as the act of March 3,
1887, c. 373, § 1, 24 Stat. 552, required that the value of
the matter in dispute, exclusive of interest and costs,
be in excess of two thousand dollars. Upon the discontinuance of the Circuit Courts this jurisdiction was transferred to the District Courts by § 24 of the Judicial Code,
subject to a restriction that thereafter the value of the
matter in controversy should exceed three thousand dollars, exclusive of interest and costs.
As long ago as Osborn v. Bank of the United States,
supra, it was settled that a suit by or against a corporation chartered by an act of Congress is one arising under a
law of the United States, and this because, as was said
in that case, pp. 823, 825: "The charter of incorporation

Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

not only creates it [the corporation], but gives it every
faculty which it possesses. The power to acquire rights
of any description, to transact business of any description,
to make contracts of any description, to sue on those
contracts, is given and measured by its charter, and that
charter is a law of the United States. This being can
acquire no right, make no contract, bring no suit, which
is not authorized by a law of the United States. It is
not only itself the mere creature of a law, but all its actions and all its rights are dependent on the same law.
Can a being, thus constituted, have a case which does
not arise literally, as well as substantially, under the law?
Take the case of a contract, which is put as the strongest
against the bank. . . . The act of Congress is its
foundation. The contract could never have been made,
but under the authority of that act. The act itself is
the first ingredient in the case, is its origin, is that from
which every other part arises. That other questions may
also arise, as the execution of the contract, or its performance, cannot change the case, or give it any other origin
than the charter of incorporation. The action still originates in, and is sustained by, that charter."
After the act of March 3, 1875, extended the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Courts to cases arising under the laws of the
United States, the ruling just quoted was uniformly
followed and applied in suits by and against Federal corporations (Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U. S. 1;
Petri v. Commercial National Bank, 142 U. S. 044, 648;
Butler v. National Home; 144 U. S. 64; Northern Pacific

excluded from that jurisdiction by some specific enact-

ment, like that of July 12, 1882, c. 290, § 4, 22 Stat. 162,
placing most of the suits by and against national banks in
the same category with suits by and against banks not
organized under the laws of the United States. Leather
Manufacturers' National Bank v. Cooper, 120 U. S. 778,
781; Continental National Bank v. Buford, 191 U. S. 119,
122.
. It results that if the general jurisdictional provision,
now embodied in § 24 of the Judicial Code, respecting
suits arising under the laws of the United States were
alone to be considered, it would have to be held that the
District Court had jurisdiction of the present suit as one
falling within that class by reason of the incorporation of
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company under a law of
the United States. But § 5 of the act of January 28, 1915,
must also be considered. It is a later enactment, is shown
by the title to be amendatory of the Judicial Code, and, as
has been seen, declares that "no court of the United
States shall have jurisdiction of any action or suit by or
against any railroad company upon the ground that said
railroad company was incorporated under an act of Congress." These are direct and comprehensive words and,
when read in the light of the settled course of decision just
mentioned, must be taken as requiring that a suit by or
against a railroad company incorporated under an act of
Congress be not regarded, for jurisdictional purposes, as
arising under the laws of the United States, unless there be
some adequate ground for so regarding it other than that
the company was thus incorporated. Plainly, there was a
purpose to effect a real change in the jurisdiction of such
suits. Counsel for plaintiff concede that this is so. But
they urge that all that is intended is to eliminate the mere
creation of-a railroad corporation under an act of Congress
as a ground for regarding the suit as arising under the
laws of the United States. In this there is an evident
misapprehension of what constitutes incorporation, as

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

241 U. S.

also of the real basis of the jurisdiction affected. A corporation is never merely created. Being artificial, possessing no faculties or powers save such as are conferred by
law, and having in legal contemplation no existence apart
from them, its incorporation consists in giving it individuality and endowing it with the faculties and powers
which it is to possess. It is upon this theory that the
decisions have proceeded. The ruling has been that a
suit by or against a Federal corporation arises under the
laws of the United States, not merely because the corporation owes its creation to an act of Congress, but because it
derives all of its capacities, faculties and powers from the
same source. This is shown in the quotation before made
from Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, and also
in the following excerpt from Shoshone Mining Co. v.
Rutter, 177 U. S. 505, 509-510: "A corporation has no
powers and can incur no obligations except as authorized
or provided for in its charter. Its power to do any act
which it assumes to do, and its liability to any obligation
which is sought to be cast upon it, depend upon its charter,
and when such charter is given by one of the laws of the
United States there is the primary question of the extent
and meaning of that law. In other words, as to every act
or obligation the first question is whether that act or
obligation is within the scope of the law of Congress, and
that being the matter which must be first determined a
suit by or against the corporation is one which involves a
construction of the terms of its charter; in other words, a
question arising under a law of Congress." And so, when
due regard is had for the terms of the amendatory section
of 1915 and for the real basis of the jurisdiction affected,
the conclusion is unavoidable that what is intended is to
make the fact that a railroad company is incorporated
under an act of Congress, that is to say, derives its existence, faculties and powers from such an act, an entirely
negligible factor in determining whether a suit by or

Opinion of the Court.

against the company is one arising under the laws of the
United States.
Upon examining the bill in the present suit, it is certain
that it does not arise under those laws apart from the
incorporation of the Texas and Pacific company under
acts of Congress. We say "acts" of Congress, because the
original act was amended and supplemented by' three
others, and the four constitute the company's charter.
Portions thereof are copied into the bill as showing that
the mortgage sought to be enforced was given under a
power conferred by Congress, but this does not help the
jurisdiction. As, under the amendatory section, the fact
that the company derives its existence and all of its faculties and powers from a Federal charter cannot avail to
give jurisdiction, it is obvious that to dwell upon the fact
that any particular power comes from the common source
must be equally unavailing.
The case of Male v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry.,
240 U. S. 97, does not make for a different conclusion,
because it was not a suit by or against a railroad company
incorporated under an act of Congress, and because it
arose and was pending in this court prior to the amendatory act of 1915 and by § 6 of that act was excepted from
its provisions.
3. Whether this is a suit between citizens of different
States turns upon whether the Texas and Pacific Company
is a citizen of Texas. It is doubtful that the pleader intended to state a case of diverse citizenship, but, be this
as it may, we are of opinion that the company is not a
citizen of any State. It was incorporated under acts of
Congress, not under state laws; and its activities and
operations were not to be confined to a single State, but
to be carried on, as in fact they are, in different States.
Of course it is a citizen of the United States in the sense
that a corporation organized under the laws of one of the
States is a citizen of that State, but it is not within the

Syllabus.

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which declares that
native born and naturalized citizens of the United States
shall be citizens of the State wherein they reside. Nor
has Congress said that it shall be regarded as possessing
state citizenship for jurisdictional purposes, as is done in
respect of national banks by §24, par. 16, of the Judicial
Code. In short, there is no ground upon which the company can be deemed a citizen of Texas, and this being so,
the suit is not one between citizens of different States.

CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO RAILWAY COMPANY
v. DE ATLEY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY.

No. 274. -Argued March 10, 1916.-Decided May 22, 1916.
The Employers' Liability Act abrogated the common-law fellow servant rule by placing negligence of a co-employee upon the same basis
,as negligence of the employer.
In saving the defence of assumption of risk in cases other than those
where the carrier's violation of a statute enacted for the safety of
employees contributed to' the injury or death, the Employers' Liability Act places a co-employee's negligence, where it is the ground
of the action, in the same relation as the employer's own negligence

would stand to the question whether a plaintiff is to be deemed to
have assumed the risk.
A railroad employee having voluntarily entered an employment requiring him on proper occasions to board a moving train assumes
the risk normally incident thereto other than such risk as may arise
from the failure of the engineer to use due care to operate the train
at a moderate rate of speed so as to enable his co-employee to board
it without undue peril.
Such an employee may presume the engineer will exercise due care

for his safety and does not assume the risk attributable to operation
at unduly high speed until made aware of danger unless the undue
