The process of deterioration is simple. It may even be
conceived to be advancement, and that intelligent selfgovernment can be trusted to adapt itself to occasion, not
needing the fetters of a predetermined rule. It may come
to be considered that a constitution is the cradle of infancy, that a nation grown up may boldly advance in
confident security against the abuses of power and that
passion will not sway more than reason. But what of the
end when the lessons of history are ignored, when the
barriers erected by wisdom gathered from experience are
weakened or destroyed? And weakened or destroyed they
may be when interest and desire feel their restraint. What
then of the end; will history repeat itself? And this is
not a cry of alarm. "Obsta principiis" was the warning
of Mr. Justice Bradley in Boyd v. United States against
the attempt of the Government to break down the constitutional privilege of the citizen by attempting to exact
from him evidence of fraud against the customs laws. I
repeat the warning. The present case is another attempt
of the same kind and should be treated in the same way.

ERROR TO AND APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
UNITED

STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK.
Nos. 358, 359.

Argued March 2, 3, 1911.-Decided May 15, 1911.

Wilson v. United States, ante, p. 361, followed to effect that an officer
of a corporation cannot refuse to produce books and papers of the
corporation in response to a subpoena duces tecum on the ground that
the contents thereof would tend to incriminate him personally.

poration in response to a subpoena duces tecum does exist the person
entitled to claim it may not waive it by his conduct.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a subpoena
duces tecum issued to the custodian of the books of a corporation, and the right of such custodian to refuse to produce the documents required by such subpoena 'on the
ground that they would incriminate him, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. W. Wickham Smith, with whom Mr. John K. Maxwell was on the brief, for plaintiff in error and appellant:
Dreier had an absolute right to refuse to produce books
for the consideration of the grand jury or to give testimony upon the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him. Burr's Trial, 244; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547.
The witness could no more be compelled to produce
books for the examination of the grand jury than to
testify orally before them. Bollman v. Fagin, 200 U. S.
186; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.
The authorities, both state and Federal, upholding the
privilege of a witness to refuse to answer questions that
he claims would tend to incriminate him, are innumerable.
Among them are the following in addition to those already
cited: Ex parte Chapman, 153 Fed. Rep. 371; In re Kanter,
117 Fed. Rep. 356; In re Hess, 134 Fed. Rep. 109; Foot v.
Buchanan, 113 Fed. Rep. 156.
The same rule has been applied in bankruptcy cases.

United States, 149 Fed. Rep. 636, at 642; United States
v. Goldstein, 132 Fed. Rep. 789.
A witness who claims privilege is not required to admit
that he is guilty. The protection of the Constitution is
for the innocent as well as for the guilty. People v. Forbes,

143 N. Y. 219; Lamsen v. Boyden, 160 Illinois, 613; Emery's
Case, 107 Massachusetts, 172.
There was no waiver by the defendant of his right to
refuse to produce books or give testimony. 29 Am. &
Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., 1093.
Where a witness has testified to certain facts having an
appargnt tendency to incriminate him and a question is
asked, an affirmative answer to which, in connection with
the other facts testified to, would furnish criminating
evidence, witness may assert his privilege. Wallace v.
State, 41 Florida, 547.
It is the duty of the court when the witness is brought
before it and shown that his answer would incriminate
him to entertain the witness's objection notwithstanding
he had stated to the grand jury that his answer would
not criminate him. Ex parte Wilson, 47 S. W. Rep. 996;
see also Lamsen v. Boyden, 160 Illinois, 613; Blum v. State,
94 Maryland, 375; Wilson v. State, 57 S. W. Rep. 916.
The Solicitor General, with whom The Attorney General,
Mr. Win. S. Kenyon, Assistant to the Attorney General,
and Mr. 0. E. Harrison,Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for the United States:
The order to produce the books and papers did not infringe the Fourth Amendment.
The search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment
does not interfere with the power of the courts to compel
production of documentary evidence through a subpcena
duces tecum. The writ of subpcena duces tecum to compel
the production of documentary evidence has come down
to us through centuries, and without it the administration
of justice would be impossible. Summers v. Moseley,
2 Cr. & M. 477; Wertheim v. Continental R. & T. Co.,
15 Fed. Rep. 718; Amey v. Long, 9 East, 473; Bull v.

DREIER v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

This court has settled the question in Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616; Interstate Com. Comm. v. Baird,
194 U. S. 25; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43.
The books belonged to the corporation, and its officer
having custody of them was bound to produce them under
a subpcena duces tecum.
A corporation can be compelled to furnish information
upon the order of a proper judicial tribunal concerning
the conduct of its business, even though such information
might be incriminatory. This is settled by Hale v. Henkel,
201 U. S. 43; Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212
U. S. 322, 348, 349; ConsolidatedRendering Co. v. Vermont,
207 U. S. 541, 553, and Am. Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister,
207 U. S. 284, 302.
It must appear to the court that the evidence sought
could reasonably have a tendency to criminate the witness
and it is then for the witness to say that such evidence
would have such a tendency. See Irvine Case, 74 Fed. Rep.
954; citing Burr Trial Case, 14692e; Regina v. Boyes, 1 Best
& Smith, 329; Ex parte Reynolds, 20 Ch. Div. 294; and see
Richmond v. The State, 2 Greene, 532; Stevens v. The State,
50 Kansas, 712; Minters v. The People, 139 Illinois, 363;
United States v. McCarthy, 18 Fed. Rep. 87; The People v.
Mather, 4 Wend. 229; Commonwealth v. Willard, 22 Pick.
476; Commonwealth v. Kimball, 24 Pick. 366; Ex parte
Senior, 37 Florida, 1; LaFontainev. Southern Underwriters,
83 N. Car. 132, 141; Floyd v. The State, 7 Texas, 215; Miskimmins v. Shaver, 8 Wyoming, 392, 418.
It is the province of the court to determine whether or
not the witness could be incriminated by truthfully answering, and it is then for the witness to determine whether
the answers would incriminate him.
The cases in which the privilege was claimed and allowed
show that it was apparent from the question asked that
a direct answer would incriminate the witness. Rex v.
Gordon, 2 Doug. K. B. Rep. 593; Paxton v. Douglas, 19

Gratt. 624; Smith v. Smith, 116 N. Car. 386; Lester v.
Boker, 6 Blatch. (Ind.) 439.
It is apparent from the record that the witness did not
invoke the protection of the Constitution in good faith.
The cautionary words used by the court in Brown v.
Walker, 101 U. S. 591, seem to describe the situation
that was before the court below. The plea of privilege
is personal to the witness and must be made in good faith
on behalf of himself, and not to shield a corporation or a
third person. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 69.
The privilege has become deeply fixed in our system
of jurisprudence and will never be abolished, and every
consideration of a proper protection of the body politic
demands that the privilege should not be extended beyond
the limits which are to be fixed by reference to its historical
origin. This means that it must be confined to the beneficent protection of the privilege to witnesses in their
personal and not their representative capacity. Wigmore
on Evidence, pp. 3101, 3107.
Every consideration that arises from conditions of
modern civilization requires that the rule should not be
extended further than is necessary to accomplish its original purpose of caring for the personal rights of individuals. Greenleaf on Evidence, 16th ed. 469d; Commonwealth v. Shaw, 4 Cush. 594; Phillips on Evidence, 4th
Am. ed., p. 935; Reynolds v. Reynolds, 1882, 15 Cox, Cr.
108, 115; Wigmore, pp. 2967, 2968, and on page 3102,
quoting Bentham.
The witness had waived his privilege.
If a witness discloses a part of a transaction with which

Opinion of the Court.

he was criminally concerned, without claiming his privilege, he must disclose the whole. People v. Freshour, 55
California, 375; Coburn v. Odell, 10 Fost. (N. H.) 540;
Foster v. Pierce, 65 Massachusetts, 439; Chamberlain v.
Wilson, 12 Vermont, 491; Commonwealth v. Nichols, 114
Massachusetts, 285.
A witness who has voluntarily testified in part on a
matter tending to criminate cannot afterwards decline to
answer a question upon the ground that it will criminate
him. Commonwealth v. Pratt, 126 Massachusetts, 462;
Commonwealth v. Price, 10 Gray, 472; People v. Carroll,
3 Park. (N. Y. Cr.) 83; Low v. Mitchell, 18 Maine, 372;
Evans v. O'Connor, 174 Massachusetts, 287; State v.
Nichols, 29 Minnesota, 357; State v. Foster, 23 N. H. 348;
State v. Kansas, 4 N. H. 562; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S.
p. 591 and cases cited on p. 597.
The writ of habeas corpus was properly dismissed.
MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error and appellant, William Dreier,
was subpoenaed to produce before the grand jury in the
Circuit Court certain books and papers of the Lichtenstein Millinery Company, a New York corporation, of
which he was the secretary. The grand jury was conducting an inquiry with respect to alleged violations of the
customs laws by N. Hayes and others. The subpoena
contained the ad testiftcandum clause, but the only question
presented is with respect to the demand for the corporate
documents. For his refusal to produce them for the inspection of the grand jury, Dreier was committed for contempt. The first case (No. 358) is a writ of error to the
Circuit Court to review the judgment holding him to be
in contempt and directing his commitment; and the second
(No. 359) is an appeal from an order dismissing a writ of
habeas corpus. The contention of Dreier in both cases is

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

221 U. S.

that the contents of the books and papers would tend to
incriminate him and that the proceedings to compel their
production were in violation of the Fifth Amendment
of the Constitution of the United States.
It is urged that if he had a privilege, his conduct was
such as to constitute a waiver. But it is not necessary to
consider the case in this aspect. Dreier was not entitled
to refuse the production of the corporate records. By
virtue of the fact that they were the documents of the
corporation in his custody, and not his private papers, he
was under obligation to produce them when called for by
proper process. Wilson v. United States, decided this
day, ante, p. 361. In that case the writ was directed to
the corporation and here it was addressed to the custodian.
As he had no privilege with respect to the corporate books
and papers it was his duty to obey.
Affirmed.
MR.

JUSTICE

McKENNA concurs in the result upon the

ground of waiver.

A legislative act by an instrumentality of the State exercising delegated authority is of the same force as if made by the legislature
