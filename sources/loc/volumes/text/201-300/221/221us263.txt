JACOBS v. BEECHAM.

Counsel for Appellants.

JACOBS v. BEECHAM.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 139. Argued April 21, 24, 1911.-Decided May 15, 1911.
Corruptio optimi pessima. Sound general principles should not be
turned to support a conclusion manifestly improper.
Even if the burden of proof is on one manufacturing a named article
under a secret formula to prove that one selling an article by the
same name is not manufacturing under that formula, there is a
prima facie presumption of difference, which protects the owner
without requiring him to give up the secret.
The burden is un a defendant who uses plaintiff's trade-name to justify
the using thereof.
Where the name of the originator has not left him to travel with the
goods the name remains with the manufacturer, as an expression of
source and not of character.
The word "Beecham's" as used in connection with pills manufactured
by the party of that name is not generic as to the article manufactured but individual as to the producer; and one calling his product
by the same name is guilty of unfair trade even if he states that he,
and not Beecham, makes them.
The word "patent" as used in connection with medicines does not
mean that the article is patented but that it is proprietary; and there
is no fraud on the public in using the word in that sense although
the article has not been patented.
The proprietor of a valuable article will not be deprived of protection
against unfair trade because of certain trivial misstatements as to
place of manufacture and Christian name of manufacturer when
both statements were true at one time and it does not appear that
the public have been improperly misled.

Mr. Moses Weill and Mr. Isaac Weill were on the brief,
for appellants:
The right to use the name of Beecham is publici juris,
and defendant is not guilty of unfair competition. Appellee has no trade-mark. There can be no trade-mark in
a proper name. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311; Brown
Chemical Co. v. Meyer, 139 U. S. 540; Corbin v. Gould, 133
U. S. 308; LeClanche Battery Co. v. Western Elec. Co., 23
Fed. Rep. 276; Hopkins on Trade-marks, 2d ed., §§ 40, 53.
No unfair competition has been shown. There is no
evidence that defendant's pills were inferior or dissimilar
to complainant's. The burden of proving such inferiority
or dissimilarity, had it existed, was on complainantappellee, and in the absence of evidence thereon an injunction granted upon that ground would be unwarranted.
Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 25 (the Chartreuse
case); Hostetter Co. v. Comerford, 97 Fed. Rep. .585;
Goodyear's &c. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 U. S. 598,
604; LaMont v. Leedy, 88 Fed. Rep. 72.
Appellant has not used the name "Beecham" in any
manner whatever calculated to deceive the public into a
belief that the goods offered for sale by him are those of
the appellee. He sold pills designated as Beecham Pills,
manufactured by Mark Jacobs, Maspeth, L. I., N. Y.,
U.S.A.
If a secret process is unpatented anyone may use it
and enter into competition with the original discoverer.

see where the secret process or formula was originally protected by letters patent, but the patent has expired,
Singer Company v. June, 163 U. S. 169, 185.
The only distinction between the cases where no patent
ever existed and where a patent has expired, is in the
method by which the right is obtained-in the one case
by dedication, and in the other by the acquisition of
knowledge of the secret. The resulting right is the same,
as was intimated by this court in the Hunyadi Case, 216
U. S. 381. Fowle v. Park, 131 U. S. 88, is distinguishable.
Complainant has no exclusive right to the manufacture and sale of these pills, nor to the use of the word
"Beecham" in connection therewith; that word being
generic and the only designation of the product, is open
to use by anyone who actually engages in the business of
manufacturing and selling this commodity, care being
taken to state by whom it is in fact manufactured. The
false use of the word "patent" disentitles complainant to
equitable relief. Holzapfel's v. Rahtjen's Co., 183 U. S. 1;
Oliphant v. Salem Flouring Mills, 5 Sawyer, 128; Consolidated v. Dorflinger, Fed. Cas. No. 3129; Leather Cloth Co.
v. Am. Leather Cloth Co., 11 H. L. Cas. 523; Worden v.
CaliforniaFig Syrup Co., 187 U. S. 516.
Cases cited in 28 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 356, and
Solez Cigar Co. v. Pozo, 16 Colorado, 388; Ford v. Foster,
L. R. 7 Ch. Div. 611, relate only to where there was a patent which had expired; but see Cheavin v. Walker, 5 Ch.
Div. 850; PreservalineMfg. Co. v. Heller Chemical Co., 118
Fed. Rep. 103; and § 4901, Rev. Stat. The English courts
have established a similar doctrine.
In the case at bar, complainant relied on a secret
process, and defendant used the name given to the article
by the discoverer of the invention, adding, however, that
it was manufactured by themselves. Cheavin v. Walker,
5 Ch. Div. 850; PharmaceuticalSociety v. Piper, 1893,

Designs (London, 1902), 188; Consolidated v. Dorflinger,
Fed. Cas. No. 3129.
Complainant has been guilty of deceiving the public,
and he now attempts to wash the stain of unconscionable conduct from his hands by a denial of misrepresentation. The case is unlike that of patent leather shoes,
because the word "patent" as used by him is not descriptive.
The misrepresentation of manufacture in England, and
the continued use of the name Thomas Beecham disentitle
complainant to equitable relief. A complainant who has
deceived the public by a false statement in regard to the
place of manufacture of his commodity is not entitled to
relief in equity. Manhattan Medicine Co. v. Wood, 108
U. S. 218, 222; Worden v. CaliforniaFig Syrup Co., supra,
at 528; Palmer v. Harris, 60 Pa. 156.
There is certainly enough in Joseph Beecham's labels
to convey to everyone who can read that the pills are
still made in England, where the business was solely conducted until about 1890, particularly in view of the express statements on circulars used for years thereafter
that the pills were prepared in that country. Saunion &
Co., Cox's Manual, case 625; Browne on Trade-marks,
2d ed., § 71, p. 78; Solez Cigar Co. v. Pozo & Suarez, 16

Dannenberg Co., 103 Georgia, 784; Raymond v. Royal
Baking Powder Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 231.
Complainant's failure to state in his labels the change
of manufacture after the assignment from Thomas
Beecham is another element of his inequitable conduct.
The continued use of the name of Thomas Beecham by
complainant should, therefore, disentitle him to the relief

The court has jurisdiction of the case at bar under § 6
of the act of March 3, 1891.
Mr. John L. Wilkie for appellee.
The appellee has not represented that his pills are manufactured under letters patent by using the words "Patent
Pills."
As to cases where the word "patent" was held not to
indicate and did not in fact indicate that the article to
which it was applied was in fact patented, see Cahn v.
Gottschalk, 14 Daly, 542; Cochrane v. McNish, 1896, App.
Cas. 225; Marshall v. Ross, L. R. 8 Eq. 651; Stewart v.
Smithson, 1 Hilton, 119; Leather Cloth Co. v. Am. Leather
Cloth Co., 11 H. L. 523; Ins. Oil Tank Co. v. Scott, 33 La.
Ann. 946.
The word "patent" is frequently used in combinations
not intended to indicate that the article has been in fact
patented. See Century Dictionary; Murray's Oxford
Dictionary; Encyclopodic Dictionary; Stormonth's Dictionary; Brewer's Etymological and Pronouncing Dictionary of Difficult Words.
In many statutes in this country the word "patent" as
applied to medicines is used as interchangeable with
"proprietary," and such use of the word has, therefore,
obtained a legislative sanction. The citations are so
numerous that they can at best be merely classified.
In the following statutes the phrase "patent or proprietary medicines" occurs in provisions regulating their

For legal construction see State v. Donaldson,41 Minnesota, 74; Nordyke v. Kehlor, 155 Missouri, 643, 653;
Palmer v. McCormick, 30 Fed. Rep. 82.
The appellee has not been guilty of any false representations either as to the place of manufacture of his product
or the person by whom the same is manufactured.
Even if a statement as to place of manufacture were
misleading, it has been abandoned for seventeen years and
cannot be made the basis of successful piracy of the name
"Beecham."
The discontinuance of a misstatement
when made before suit brought relieves the complainant
of the effect of the rule. Moxie Nerve & Food Co. v. Modox
Co., 153 Fed. Rep. 487; Johnson & Johnson v. Sedbury &
Johnson (N. J.), 67 Atl. Rep. 36; Symonds v. Jones, 82
Maine, 302.
As to the alleged misstatement that the pills are prepared only and sold wholesale by the proprietor, Thomas

JACOBS v. BEECHAM.
221 U. S.

Argument for Appellee.

Beecham, Lancashire, England, all of the forms used since
1902 are necessarily objectionable and under the authorities cited appellant cannot rake up the past to find in a
long discontinued user, evidence of untrue statements.
See "Moxie" and other cases, supra.
Also the alleged misstatement is that the pills are
specially packed for the United States of America, being
covered with a quickly soluble, pleasant coating, completely disguising the taste of the pill. This was used
while the pills were both packed and made in the United
States, and the whole question is whether or not the
clause is false, not by virtue of what it says, but of what
it suggests. Wrisley Co. v. Iowa Soap Co., 104 Fed. Rep.
548, does not apply. The words here do not call for the
interpretation that the pills are made in England, although
packed for the United States. They are equally true
wherever the pills are made. See Tarrant & Co. v. Johann
Hoff, 76 Fed. Rep. 959; Clark Thread Co. v. Armitage, 74
Fed. Rep. 936; Socit4 Anonyme v. Western Distilling Co.,
43 Fed. Rep. 416; Siegert v. Gandolfi, 149 Fed. Rep. 100;
Gluckman v. Strauch, 99 App. Div. 361; aff'd 186 N. Y.
560.
As to alleged misrepresentations as to the persons by
whom the pills are manufactured, there was no misrepresentation. Manhattan Medicine Co. v. Wood, 108 U. S.218.
The real proprietor of the trade-name used in connection
with these pills has never been the person of Thomast
Beecham as distinguished from Joseph, or any other person, but has always been and is "Thomas Beecham of
St. Helens, England," a partnership formerly composed
of both Thomas and Joseph to which the latter succeeded
as sole surviving partner. The appellee is lawfully continuing the business under the old name, as he has done
since 1895, and the statement that the pills were manufactured and sold "by the proprietor Thomas Beecham,
St. Helens, England," was strictly speaking as accurate

Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

in point of fact after the transfer of 1895 as it was before.
It cannot be regarded as a misrepresentation or a fraudulent statement.
The appellee is not barred from relief because his pills
happen to be made under a secret process or formula.
The rule that an owner of a secret process, unpatented,
may not enjoin another from manufacturing goods under
that process and marketing them under the name used to
describe them by the original manufacturer, and by which
they have come to be known to the public, provided the
latter comes to his knowledge of the process in good faith
has no application to this case.
Appellee's right to relief does not depend in any way
upon the fact of his goods being manufactured under a
secret process. His right to relief depends simply upon
the fact of the appellant's manufacturing and selling
similar goods, calling them by his trade-name.
There is no less right on the part of a manufacturer of
goods made under a secret process or formula to protection of his trade-name than on the part of an ordinary
manufacturer of goods.
The rule is not that the owner of a valuable trfade-name
cannot enjoin the manufacturer of similar goods under the
same name unless he can show that such goods are manufactured under a secret process other than that used by
himself, but rather that he can enjoin such use of his
trade-name unless the person attempting to use the same
can justify his attempted use by showing similarity of
secret process and good faith in the acquisition of knowledge as to the same.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill by the owner of a proprietary or patent
medicine, so called, made according to a secret formula
and known as Beecham's Pills, to restrain the defendant

JACOBS v. BEECHAM.
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

from using the same name on pills made by him, and trying to appropriate the plaintiff's good will. The plaintiff
had a decree in the Circuit Court enjoining the defendant
from using the word Beecham in connection with pills
prepared or sold by him, which decree was affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 159 Fed. Rep. 129. 86
C. C. A. 623.
The present appeal is based on two or three different
grounds. The first of these is that anyone who honestly
can discover the formula has a right to use it, to tell the
public that he is using it, and for that purpose to employ
the only words by which the formula can be identified to
the public mind. As to the defendant's having discovered
the formula, it is said that if he makes a different or inferior article the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the fact.
As to the method adopted by the defendant to advertise
his wares, which, apart from other imitations, consists in
simply marking them Beecham's Pills, it is said that the
proper name cannot constitute a trade-mark and has become the generic designation of the thing. The defendant's use of the name is said to be saved from being unfair by the statement underneath that he made the pills.
Corruptio optimi pessima. Sound general propositions
thus are turned to the support of a conclusion that manifestly should not be reached. We will follow and answer
the argument in the order in which we have stated it. If,
in a technical sense, the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs
to prove that the defendant's pills are not made by his
formula, there is at least a prima facie presumption of
difference, just as in the case of slander there is a presumption that slanderous words are false. A different rule
would prevent the owner of a secret process from protecting it except by giving up his secret. Again, when the defendant has to justify using the plaintiff's trade-name,
the burden is on him. Finally, as the case presents what
is a fraud on its face, it is more likely that the defendant is

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

a modern advertiser than that he has discovered the hidden formula of the plaintiff's success.
As to the defendant's method of advertising, he does
not simply say that he has the Beecham formula, as in
Saxlehner v. Wagner, 216 U. S. 375, but he says that he
makes Beecham's Pills. The only sense in which Beechain's Pills can be said to have become a designation of
the article is that Beecham, so far as appears, is the only
man who has made it. But there is nothing generic in the
designation. It is in the highest degree individual and
means the producer as much as the product. It has not
left the originator, to travel with the goods, as in Chadwick v. Covell, 151 Massachusetts, 190, 195, or come to
express character rather than source, as it is admitted
sometimes may be the case. Holzapfel's Compositions Co.
v. Rahtjen's American Composition Co., 183 U. S. 1. Goodyear's India Rubber Glove Manuf. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber
Co., 128 U. S. 598. Thomson v. Winchester, 19 Pick. 214,
216. To call pills Beecham's Pills is to call them the plaintiff's pills. The statement that the defendant makes them
does not save the fraud. That is not what the public would
notice or is intended to notice, and, if it did, its natural
interpretation would be that the defendant had bought the
original business out and was carrying it on. It would be
unfair, even if we could assume, as we cannot, that the
defendant uses the plaintiff's formula for his pills. McLean
v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 252. Millington v. Fox, 3 My. &
Cr. 338, 352. Gilman v. Hunnewell, 122 Massachusetts,
139, 148.
The other grounds of appeal are charges that the plaintiff's boxes have upon them false statements such as to
exclude him from equitable relief. The one most pressed
is that certain of the boxes carry the words Beecham's
Patent Pills, and that the pills are not patented. The
answer is that the word does not convey the notion that
they are. To signify that, the proper word is 'patented'

JACOBS v. BEECHAM.
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

rather than 'patent,' and it commonly is used separately,
not prefixed to a noun. On the other hand, the use of the
word patent to indicate medicines made by secret formulas
is widespread and well known. It is mentioned in the
dictionaries, and it occurs in the plaintiff's circulars. We
think it clear that there is no danger that anyone would
be defrauded by the form of the label on the plaintiff's
box, and that it would be wrong to press Holzapfel's Compositions Co. v. Rahtjen's American Composition Co., 183
U. S. 1, so far as to cover this case.
It is objected further that the plaintiff's boxes are labelled "Beecham's Patent Pills, price 25 cents, sold by the
Proprietor, St. Helens, Lancashire, England," or "Beecham's Patent Pills, St. Helens, Lancashire," or "Beecham's Pills, Saint Helens," and that a circular contains
the statement that "The pills accompanying this pamphlet are specially packed for U. S. America, being covered
with a quickly soluble pleasant coating" &c. The statement in the circular is true in a literal sense, but suggests
the belief that the pills were made in England whereas in
fact they now are made in New York. The labels may be
said to convey a similar suggestion in a fainter form. With
this may be mentioned the remaining object of cavil, that
some of the boxes still bear the name of Thomas Beecham,
although Thomas Beecham transferred his interest to the
plaintiff, his son, in 1895. Both of these matters are small
survivals from a time when they were literally true and
are far too insignificant when taken with the total character of the plaintiff's advertising to leave him a defenceless
prey to the world. The facts are that the business was
started by Thomas Beecham, in England, that he made
the pills there and got a considerable custom in America,
that he took the plaintiff into partnership, continuing the
business under the old name, and that in 1895 he retired,
turning over his interest to his son. The son went on under the same name for a time, but his boxes now bear his

own name as proprietor, and his circulars show that he
is his father's successor. About 1890 they began to make
the pills in New York as well as in England, but, as has
been seen, not every phrase in the advertisements was
nicely readjusted to the change. That is all there is in
the whole subject of complaint. There is not the slightest
ground for charging the plaintiff with an attempt to defraud the public by these statements, or any reason why
the judgment below should not be affirmed, unless it be
in a motion of the plaintiff to dismiss. This was met by the
fact that the bill seemingly relied upon the registration of
the words Beecham's Pills as a trade-mark under the act
of Congress as one ground for the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court. Warner v. Searle & Hereth Co., 191 U. S. 195, 205,

MATTER OF HARRIS, BANKRUPT.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 165.

Argued April 28, 1911.-Decided May 15, 1911.

The right under the Fifth Amendment not to be compelled to be a
witness against oneself is not a right to appropriate property that
may tell one's story.
A bankrupt is not deprived of his constitutional right not to testify
against himself by an order requiring him to surrender his books to
the duly authorized receiver. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S.
547, distinguished.
Under § 2 of the act of 1898, where the bankruptcy court can enforce
title against the bankrupt in favor of the trustee, it can enforce possession ad interim in favor of the receiver; and so held as to books of
the bankrupt.
