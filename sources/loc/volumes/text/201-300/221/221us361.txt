The ad testificandum clause is not essential to the validity of a subpoena duces tecum, and the production of papers by one having them

Where the subpoena duces tecum contains the usual ad testificandum

The right of one responding to a subpoena duces tecum to show why he

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Syllabus.

221 U S.

A corporation is not relieved from responding to a subpcena duces tecum
or from producing the documents required by reason of the provisions
of §§ 877 and 829, Rev. Stat., or those of the Sixth Amendment to
the Constitution.
A subpoena duces tecum, which is suitably specific and properly limited
in its scope, and calls for the production of documents which, as
against their lawful owner to whom the writ is directed, the party
procuring its issuance is entitled to have produced, does not violate
the unreasonable search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment, and the constitutional privilege against testifying against
himself cannot be raised for his personal benefit by an officer of the
corporation having the documents in his possession.
A lawful command to a corporation is in effect a command to its
officers, who may be punished for contempt for disobedience of its
terms.
An officer of a corporation is protected by the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amendment against the compulsory production
of his private books and papers, but this privilege does not extend
to books of the corporation in his possession.
An officer of a corporation cannot refuse to produce documents of a
corporation on the ground that they would incriminate him simply
because he himself wrote or signed them, and this even if indictments are pending against him.
Physical custody of incriminating documents does not protect the
custodian against their compulsory production. The privilege which
exists as to private papers cannot be maintained.
Under the visitatorial power of the State, and the authority of Congress
over corporate activities within the domain subject to Congress, a
corporation must submit its books and papers whenever properly
required so to do and cannot resist on the ground of self-incrimination, even if the inquiry may be to detect and prevent violations of
law. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 74.
An officer of a corporation cannot withhold its books to save it, or if
he is implicated in its violation of law, to protect himself, from disclosures, although he may decline to utter on the witness stand any
self-incriminating word.
An officer cannot withhold from a grand jury corporate documents in
his possession because the inquiry was directed against the corporation itself.
Notwithstanding English views as to the extent of protection against
self-incrimination the duties of corporations and officers thereof are
to be determined by our laws.

WILSON v. UNITED STATES,
221 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error and Appellant.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a subpoena
duces tecum issued to a corporation, and the right of an
officer thereof to refuse to produce the documents required by such subpoena on the ground that they tended
to incriminate him, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John B. Stanchfield, with whom Mr. Louis S. Levy
and Mr. William M. Parke were on the brief, for plaintiff
in error and appellant:
The disclosure of the contents of the letter press copy
book, produced by appellant before the grand jury, would
tend to incriminate plaintiff in error; the contents of the
letter press copy book would form a link in the chain of
evidence exposing him to indictment and to conviction on
the two indictments previously found against him in the
same court. In re Chapman, 153 Fed. Rep. 371; In re
Hale, 139 Fed. Rep. 496; S. C., aff'd 201 U. S. 439; Fort
v. Buchanan, 113 Fed. Rep. 156.
The privilege of a witness against producing books and
papers under a subpoena duces tecum when the production
thereof would tend to incriminate him, is even more fully
protected than his privilege of refusing to make answer
orally under an ordinary subpoena, when his oral answer
would tend to incriminate him; because the former privilege is protected by both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, while the latter is protected by the Fifth Amendment only. Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616; United
States v. Collins, 146 Fed. Rep. 555; United States v.
Armour, 142 Fed. Rep. 808.
An officer of a corporation who actually holds the
physical possession, custody and control of books or
papers of the corporation which he is required by a subpena duces tecum to produce, is entitled to the same protection against exposing the contents thereof which would
tend to incriminate him, as if the books and papers were
absolutely his own. In re Hale, 139 Fed. Rep. 496; S. C.,

Argument for Plaintiff in Error and Appellant.

221 U. S

aff'd, 201 U. S. 43; Ex parte Chapman, 153 Fed. Rep.
371.
The principles above set forth have long been upheld
by the courts of England. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments merely continued the right which was guaranteed
by the common law, a right which has always been jealously guarded when properly claimed. See King v. Dr.
Purnell, 1 W. Blackstone, 37; Green v. Granatelli, 7
State Trials (N. S.), 979.
The rights guaranteed to every natural person by the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments are substantial, not
merely formal and technical, and cannot be defeated by
any fictional distinction by which the single and indivisable natural person is deemed to act or to be proceeded
against in a representative capacity, and not in an individual capacity.
An officer of a corporation who is in possession of a book
of the corporation containing a record made under his
direction of his own acts and statements and tending to
incriminate him, cannot be compelled in a criminal proceeding against himself to produce and permit the inspection of such books (either directly or by being forced
to turn the book over to some other officer of the corporation) by means of a subpoena duces tecum addressed to
the corporation directing the production of the book in
question.
A subpoena duces tecum is a possessory writ. It searches
all books and papers in the possession of the witness at
the time of the service of the subpoena and in the eye of
the law seizes such as are specified in the subpoena and are
then in the possession of the witness. Bank v. Hilliard,5
Cowen (N. Y.), 153, 158; Nelson v. United States, 201 U. S.
92, 115, 116; Hall v. Young, 37 N. H. 134.
The subpoena duces tecum addressed to the corporation only was unauthorized and void. Hale v. Henkel, 201

§ 2200; United States v. Ralston, 17 Fed. Rep. 903; Re
Shaw, 172 Fed. Rep. 520. The cases cited by the Government do not sustain its contention.
A subpoena addressed to a corporation merely would
be entirely subversive of the right guaranteed by the
Constitution and the English Bill of Rights.
The dictum of Judge Lacombe in United States v. American Tobacco Co., 146 Fed. Rep. 557, and the decision of
the same judge in In re American Sugar Co., 178 Fed. Rep.
109, upholding the validity of a subpoena addressed to a
corporation, and not to any officer thereof, are not in
accord with the spirit of Federal decisions, the Constitution of the United States, and the rights of an individual
guaranteed since the English Bill of Rights.
The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Henry E. Colton,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on the
brief, for the United States:
The grand jury was engaged in an inquiry which gave
it authority to summon witnesses, and to call for the
production of books and papers. Hale v. Henkel, 201
U. S. 43.
The subpoena duces tecum was a valid process. United

Sugar Co., 178 Fed. Rep. 109; Consolidated Rendering
Co. v. Vermont, 207 U. S. 541.
No objection to the subpoena having been made at any
prior stage of the proceedings, such objection cannot be
made for the first time in this court.
The search and seizure involved in the subpoena duces
tecum were not unreasonable, since the subpoena was
specific as to the'person to whom it was directed and
what was to be produced thereunder, and it was issued
for the lawful purpose of securing material testimony in an

Wilson was not required by the subpoena, nor by any
of the proceedings thereon, "to be a witness against himself." The subpcena called for a book which belonged
to the United Wireless Telegraph Company, which had
come into his physical custody simply as an officer of that
company, and had been recalled from such custody by
formal action of the board of directors. He was not
protecting himself in the possession of his own books nor
refusing to be a witness against himself, but was obstructing the company and its representatives, other than himself, in the performance of an order of the court for the
production of books of the company, which they were
willing to perform. State v. Davis, 108 Missouri, 666;

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
These three cases involve the same question. The first is
a writ of error to the Circuit Court to review a judgment
committing the plaintiff in error for contempt. The second is an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court dismissing a writ of habeas corpus sued out after such com-

mitment. The third is an appeal from an order dismissing
a writ of habeas corpus by which a discharge was sought
from a later commitment for a similar contempt.
The contempt consisted in the refusal of the plaintiff in
error and appellant, Christopher C. Wilson, to permit the
inspection by a grand jury of letter press copy books in
his possession. The books belonged to a corporation of
which he was president and were required to be produced
by a subpoena duces tecum.
The circumstances were these: The grand jury empannelled in the Circuit Court for some time had been
inquiring into alleged violations of §§ 5440 and 5480 of
the United States Revised Statutes by Wilson and others.
Wilson was the president of the United Wireless Telegraph
Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of Maine. On August 3, 1910, the grand jury found
two indictments against him and certain officers, directors
and stockholders of this corporation, the one charging
fraudulent use of the mails and the other a conspiracy
for such use. The grand jury continued its investigations
and on October 7, 1910, a subpoena duces tecum was issued
(set forth in the margin 1), which was directed to the
President of the United States of America to United Wireless
Telegraph Company, 42 Broadway, New York, N. Y., Greeting:

Letter press copy books of United Wireless Telegraph Company
containing copies of letters and telegrams signed or purporting to be
signed by the President of said company during the months of May
and June, 1909; in regard to an alleged violation of the statutes of the
United States by C. C. Wilson.
And for a failure to produce the aforesaid documents you will be

United Wireless Telegraph Company, requiring its appearance before the grand jury and the production by it
of the letter press copy books of the company "containing
copies of letters and telegrams signed or purporting to be
signed by the President of said company during the
month of May and June, 1909; in regard to an alleged
violation of the statutes of the United States by C. C.
Wilson."
Service was made upon the company by service upon
Wilson, as president, and upon its secretary and two
directors. On the return day Wilson appeared before the
grand jury, and in response to questions, when not under
oath, stated that he answered the call of the United Wireless Telegraph Company and declined to answer further
questions until he was sworn; and having been sworn, and
being asked whether or not the company produced the
letter press copy books called for, he filed a written statement in which, after describing the subpcena, he said:
"III. Said letter press copy books for the months of
May and June, 1909, in said subpoena mentioned during
said months of May and June, 1909, were kept regularly
in my office as President of said corporation, and were
regularly used by me and for the most part, if not entirely,
by me only, and contained copies of my personal and other
correspondence, as well as copies of the correspondence
relating to the business and affairs of said corporation.

For the greater part of the time during and since May and
June, 1909, and all the time during the last month and
deemed guilty of a contempt of Court, and liable to the penalties of the
law.

of the United States, at the Borough of Manhattan, City of New
York, the 7th day of October, 1910.

more, said letter press copy books have been and still are
in my possession, custody and control, and as against any
other officer or employ6 of said corporation, or any other
person, I have been entitled to such possession, custody
and control. I did not secure and have not at any time
held possession of said letter press copy books in anticipation that any subpcena for their production would be
served upon me or said corporation, or for the purpose of
evading any subpcena or other legal process which might
be served upon me or said corporation."
He alleged that he was the "C. C. Wilson" mentioned
in the subpcena as the one against whom the inquiry was
directed, and described the pending indictments. He
stated that the letter press copy books were essential to
the preparation of his defense and that he was using them
for that purpose; that he believed that the matters therein
contained would tend to incriminate him; and that he
"should not be compelled, directly or indirectly, to furnish
or produce said letter press copy books as called for by
said subpoena," nor to testify in regard to their contents,
nor permit them to be used against him. He added that
he had the books with him, but that he declined to deliver
them to the grand jury, insisting that his refusal was in
entire good faith.
The grand jury presented the matter to the court and
Wilson was adjudged to be in contempt and was committed to the custody of the marshal "until he shall cease
to obstruct and impede the United Wireless Telegraph
Company from complying with the subpoena duces tecum
attached to the above mentioned presentment, or otherwise purge himself from this contempt." This is the
judgment which is the subject of review in the first case
(No. 759).
Wilson then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the commitment was illegal for the reasons
(1) that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain
voL. ccxxi-24

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

the charge of contempt, (2) that there was no "cause" or
"action" pending in the court between the United States
and any party mentioned in the subpoena, in which the
petitioner could be required to testify or give evidence,
(3) that the grand jury was not in the exercise of its
legitimate authority in prosecuting the investigation set
out in the presentment, its powers being limited to the
investigation of specific charges against particular persons, and (4) that the subpoena was illegal, unauthorized
and void because it did not comply with § 877 of the
United States Revised Statutes in that it required the
person addressed to appear and not to attend, and did not
require the person addressed "to testify generally" in
behalf of the United States; and because it was not issued
pursuant to an order of court, was addressed to the corporation without mention of any individual or officer,
and would not apprise the defendant in the prosecution
which might follow of the name of the precise witness who
might have appeared against him.
It was further urged, reiterating in substance what had
been said to the grand jury, that the petitioner should
not be held in contempt as the subpoena was not directed
to him, but merely to the corporation; and generally
that the proceedings were in violation of his rights under
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of
the United States.
The writ was issued and on return being made of the
commitment was dismissed and the petitioner remanded,
and from this order an appeal was taken to this court

(No. 760).
Later, on October 28, 1910, another subpoena duces
tecum was issued in the same form, addressed to the
United Wireless Telegraph Company, and calling for the
same books. It was served on the appellant Wilson and
also on the secretary and five directors of the company.
On the return day, they appeared before the grand jury,

Opinion of the Court.

the appellant Wilson then having in his possession a
letter press copy book which the subpoena described, but
upon demand being made it was not produced before the
grand jurors for their inspection. The foreman then
directed the production of the books on the following day,
when the same persons again appeared, Wilson still having the book above mentioned, and the demand and refusal were repeated.
Thereupon the grand jury through the District Attorney made an oral presentment to the court, in the presence of Wilson and the others who had been served with
the subpoena, that the corporation and its officers and
directors were in contempt, and specifically with respect
to Wilson that he was "preventing the corporation from
complying with the process." On behalf of the directors
before the court it was stated that they had made efforts
to obtain the books for production before the grand jury,
but that Wilson had declined to surrender them. They
presented the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors held on that day at which these directors, constituting a majority of the board, had passed a resolution
demanding of Wilson the possession of the letter press
copy books called for by the subpoena "for the production
of the same before the Federal Grand Jury." The court
again adjudged Wilson to be in contempt and ordered his
commitment "until he delivers to the United Wireless
Telegraph Company the said books called for by said
subpcena, and ceases to obstruct and impede the process
of this Court, or otherwise purge himself of this contempt." A writ of habeas corpus was then issued upon a
petition alleging the same objections to the subpcena and
commitment which had been set forth in the petition for
the former writ. On return the writ was dismissed and
the petitioner appealed (No. 788).
We may first consider the objections to the validity of
the subpoena and then the claim of privilege.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

r221 U. S.

The objections to the jurisdiction on the ground that
there was no "cause" or "specific charge" pending before the grand jury were made and answered in Hale v.
Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, and require no further examination.
But the question is also presented whether the subpcena
was unauthorized, and hence void, because it was not
directed to an individual, but to a corporation. It is
urged that its form was unusual and unwarranted, in that
it did not require any one to attend and to testify, but
simply directed a corporation, which could not give oral
testimony, to produce books.
While a subpcena duces tecum ordinarily contains the
ad testificandum clause, this cannot be regarded as essential to its validity. The power to compel the production
of documents is, of course, not limited to those cases where
it is sought merely to supplement or aid the testimony of
the person required to produce them. The production
may be enforced independently of his testimony, and it
was held long since that the writ of subpcena duces tecum
was adquate for this purpose. As was said by Lord Ellenborough in Amey v. Long, 9 East, 484, "The right to resort to means competent to compel the production of
written, as well as oral, testimony seems essential to the
very existence and constitution of a Court of common law,
which receives and acts upon both descriptions of evidence, and could not possibly proceed with due effect
without them." Where the subpcena duces tecum contains the usual ad testificandum clause, still it is not
necessary for the party requiring the production to have
the person producing the documents sworn as a witness.
They may be proved by others. 3 Wigmore on Evidence,

"I always thought," said Parke, J., in Perry v. Gibson,
supra, "that a subpoena duces tecum had two distinct
objects, and that one might be enforced without the
other." In Summers v. Moseley, supra, the function of
the writ was carefully considered and the judgment was
rendered after consultation with the judges of the other
courts. It was argued that "the duces tecum part of the
writ is only compulsory as ancillary to the ad testificandum
part." But the reasoning of the court negatived the contention; and it was ruled that the person subpoenaed was
"compellable to produce the document in his possession
without being sworn, the party calling upon him to produce it not having occasion to ask him any question."
Bayley, B., said: "The origin of the subpoena duces tecum
does not distinctly appear. It has been said on the part
of the defendant that it was not introduced or known in
practice till the reign of Charles the Second, and it may
be that in its present form the subpcena duces tecum was
not known or made use of until that period; but no doubt
can be entertained that there must have been some
process similar to the subpoena duces tecum to compel the
production of documents, not only before that time, but
even before the statute of the 5th of Elizabeth. Prior
to that statute, there must have been a power in the
crown (for it would have been utterly impossible to carry
on the administration of justice without such power) to
require the attendance in courts of justice of persons
capable of giving evidence, and the production of documents material to the cause, though in the possession of a
stranger. The process for that purpose might not be
called a subpena duces tecum, but I may call it a subpoena
to produce; the party called upon in pursuance of such a
process not as a witness, but simply to produce, would do
so or not, and if he did not, I can entertain no doubt that

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

221 U. S.

it would have been open to the party for whom he was
called to make an application to the court in the ensuing
term to punish him for his contempt in not producing the
document in obedience to such subpcena. Whether he
could require to be sworn not ad testificandum, but true
answer to make to such questions as the court should
demand of him touching the possession or custody of the
document, is not now the question. Perhaps he might;
but we are clearly of opinion that he has no right to require that a party bringing him into court for the mere
purpose of producing a document should have him sworn
in such a way as to make him a witness in the cause,
when it may often happen that he is a mere depository,
and knows nothing of the documents of which he has the
custody."
Treating the requirement to produce as separable from
the requirement to testify generally what one knows in
the cause, it follows that the latter may be omitted from
the subpoena without invalidating the former. This
course does not impair any right either of the opposing
party or of the person responding to the subpcena. The
latter may still have the opportunity to which he has
been held entitled (Aiken v. Martin, supra), of showing
under oath the reasons why he should not be compelled to
produce the document. For this right does not depend
upon the ad testificandum clause, but is incident to the
requirement to produce.
Where the documents of a corporation are sought the
practice has been to subpoena the officer who has them in
his custody. But there would seem to be no reason why
the subpoena duces tecum should not be directed to the
corporation itself. Corporate existence implies amenability to legal process. The corporation may be sued;
it may be compelled by mandamus, and restrained by injunction, directed to it. Possessing the privileges of a legal
entity, and having records, books and papers, it is under

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

a duty to produce them when they may properly be required in the administration of justice.
There is no merit in the appellant's contention with
respect to the application of § 877 of the United States
Revised Statutes. The provision of the section that
witnesses required on the part of the United States shall
be subpoenaed "to attend to testify generally on their
behalf, and not to depart the court without leave thereof,
or of the district attorney," is in the interest of convenient
and economical administration and has no bearing upon
the questions here involved. It is said that, under the
form of writ used in this case, the defendant in the prosecution which might follow an indictment by the grand
jury would not be apprised of the name of the precise
witness who might have appeared against him, and § 829
of the Revised Statutes and the Sixth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution are invoked. The contention ignores
the fact that the writ calls for books and not for oral
testimony; and, aside from this, neither the constitutional
provision nor the statute accords the right to be apprised
of the names of the witnesses who appeared before the
grand jury. Even in cases of treason and other capital
offenses, under § 1033 of the Revised Statutes, the required list of witnesses is only of those who are to be
produced on the trial. Logan v. United States, 144 U. S.
263, 304; United States v. Curtis, 4 Mason, 232; Balliet
v. United States, 122 Fed. Rep. 692.
Nor was the process invalid under the Fourth Amendment. The rule laid down in the case of Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616, is not applicable here. In that case,
an information for the forfeiture of goods under the Customs Act of June 22, 1874, c. 391, 18 Stat. 187, it was
held that the enforced production "of the private books
and papers" of the owner of the goods sought to be forfeited, under the provisions of § 5 of that act, was "compelling him to be a witness against himself within the

meaning of the Fifth Amendment" and was also "the
equivalent of a search and seizure-and an unreasonable
search and seizure-within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment." But there is no unreasonable search and
seizure, when a writ, suitably specific and properly limited
in its scope, calls for the production of documents which,
as against their lawful owner to whom the writ is directed,
the party procuring its issuance is entitled to have produced. In the present case, the process was definite and
reasonable in its requirements, and it was not open to the
objection made in Hale v. Henkel, supra (pp. 76, 77). Addressed to the corporation, and designed to enforce its
duty, no ground appears upon which the corporation could
have resisted the writ. And the corporation made no objection of any sort. The appellant did not attempt to assert any right on its part; his conduct was in antagonism
to the corporation, so far as its attitude is shown. A majority of the directors, not including the appellant, appeared before the court and urged their solicitude to comply with the writ. They presented their formal action,
taken at a meeting of the board, in which they demanded
of the appellant the delivery of the books for production
before the grand jury.
Concluding, then, that the subpcena was valid and
that its service imposed upon the corporation the duty of
obedience, there can be no doubt that the appellant was
likewise bound by it unless, with respect to the books
described, he could claim a personal privilege. A command to the corporation is 'in effect a command to those
who are officially responsible for the conduct of its affairs.
If they, apprised of the writ directed to the corporation,
prevent compliance or fail to take appropriate action
within their power for the performance of the corporate
duty, they, no less than the corporation itself, are guilty
of disobedience and may be punished for contempt. The
applicable principle was thus stated by Chief Justice

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 UJ. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Waite in Commissioners v. Sellew, 99 U. S. 624, 627,
where a peremptory mandamus was directed against a
municipal board:" As the corporation can only act through
its agents, the courts will operate upon the agents through
the corporation. When a copy of the writ which has been
ordered is served upon the clerk of the board, it will be
served on the corporation, and be equivalent to a command that the persons who may be members of the board
shall do what is required. If the members fail to obey,
those guilty of disobedience may, if necessary, be punished for the contempt. Although the command is in form
to the board, it may be enforced against those through
whom alone it can be obeyed. . . . While the board
is proceeded against in its corporate capacity, the individual members are punished in their natural capacities
for failure to do what the law requires of them as the representatives of the corporation." See also Leavenworth
v. Kinney, 154 U. S. 642; People v. Sturtevant, 9 N. Y. 277.
The appellant asserts his privilege against self-crimination. There is no question, of course, of oral testimony,
for he was not required to give any. Undoubtedly it also
protected him against the compulsory production of his
private books and papers. Boyd v. United States, supra;
Bollman v. Fagin,200 U. S. 195. But did it extend to the
corporate books?
For there can be no question of the character of the
books here called for. They were described in the subpcena as the books of the corporation, and it was the
books so defined which, admitting possession, he withheld. The copies of letters written by the president of
the corporation in the course of its transactions were as
much a part of its documentary property, subject to its
control and to its duty to produce When lawfully required
in judicial proceedings, as its ledgers and minute books.
It was said in the appellant's statement before the grand
jury that the books contained copies of his "personal

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

and other correspondence as well as copies of the correspondence relating to the business and affairs" of the corporation. But his personal letters were not demanded;
these the subpoena did not seek to reach; and as to these
no question of violation of privilege is presented. Plainly
he could not make these books his private or personal
books by keeping copies of personal letters in them. Had
the appellant merely sought to protect his personal correspondence from examination, it would not have been
difficult to have provided, under the supervision of the
court, for the withdrawal of such letters from scrutiny.
Indeed, on the hearing of the second presentment, the
court suggested their removal from the books. But the
appellant was not content with protection against the
production of his private letters; he claimed the privilege
to withhold the corporate books and the documents
which related to corporate matters and with respect to
which he had acted in his capacity as the executive officer
of the corporation. And that is the right here asserted.
It is at once apparent that the mere fact that the appellant himself wrote, or signed, the official letters copied
into the books, neither conditioned nor enlarged his
privilege. Where one's private documents would tend
to incriminate him, the privilege exists although they
were actually written by another person. And where an
officer of a corporation has possession of corporate records
which disclose his crime, there is no ground upon which it
can be said that he will be forced to produce them if the
entries were made by another, but may withhold them if
the entries were made by himself. The books are no
more his private books in the latter case than in the
former; if they have been held pursuant to the authority
of the corporation, that authority is subject to termination. In both cases production tends to criminate; and
if requiring him to produce compels him to be a witness
against himself in the one case it does so equally in the

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

other. There are other facts which serve to sharpen the
claim of privilege, but are not determinative. Thus,
there were two indictments pending against the appellant,
and the inquiry before the grand jury was also directed
against him. If, however, the privilege existed with respect to these books in his hands, it would have been
likewise available had there been no prior indictments
and had the immediate investigation concerned violations
of law by others. The privilege holds although the
pursuit of the person required to produce has not yet
begun; it is the incriminating tendency of the disclosure
and not the pendency of the prosecution against the witness upon which the right depends. Counselman v.
Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 562, 563.
We come then to the broader contention of the appellant,-thus stated in the argument of his counsel: "An
officer of a corporation who actually holds, the physical
possession, custody and control of books or papers of the
corporation which he is required by a subpcena duces
tecum to produce, is entitled to the same protection
against exposing the contents thereof which would tend
to incriminate him, as if the books and papers were absolutely his own." That is, the power of the courts to
require their production depends not upon their character
as corporate books and the duty of the corporation to
submit them to examination, but upon the particular
custody in which they may be found. If they are in the
actual custody of an officer whose criminal conduct they
would disclose, then, as this argument would have it, his
possession must be deemed inviolable, and, maintaining
the absolute control which alone will insure protection
from their being used against him in a criminal proceeding, he may defy the authority of the corporation whose
officer or fiduciary he is and assert against the visitatorial
power of the State, and the authority of the Government
in enforcing its laws, an impassable barrier.

OCTOBER TERM, 1010.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

But the physical custody of incriminating documents
does not of itself protect the custodian against their
compulsory production. The question still remains with
respect to the nature of the documents and the capacity
in which they are held. It may yet appear that they are
of a character which subjects them to the scrutiny demanded and that the custodian has voluntarily assumed
a duty which overrides his claim of privilege. This was
clearly implied in the Boyd Case where the fact that the
papers involved were the private papers of the claimant
was constantly emphasized. Thus, in the case of public
records and official documents, made or kept in the administration of public office, the fact of actual possession
or of lawful custody would not justify the officer in resisting inspection, even though the record was made by himself and would supply the evidence of his criminal dereliction. If he has embezzled the public moneys and falsified
the public accounts he cannot seal his official records and
withhold them from the prosecuting authorities on a plea
of constitutional privilege against self-crimination. The
principle applies not only to public documents in public
offices, but also to records required by law to be kept in
order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental
regulation and the enforcement of restrictions validly
established. There the privilege, which exists as to private
papers, cannot be maintained.
There are abundant illustrations in the decisions. Thus
in Bradshaw v. Murphy, 7 C. & P. 612, it was held that a
vestry clerk who was called as a witness could not on the
ground that it might incriminate himself object to the
production of the vestry books kept under the statute, 58
George III, chapter 69, § 2. In State v. Farnum,73 S. Car.
165, it appeared that a legislative committee had been
appointed to investigate the affairs of the State Dispensary, and it was provided that it should have access to

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

all books of the institution or of any officer or employ6
thereof. In anticipation the state dispenser removed
certain books from the files, defending his action on the
plea that they contained private matter which the committee had no right to inspect. The court ruled that it
was the "obvious duty of any officer to keep books,
letters and other documents relating to the business of his
office and to the manner in which he has discharged or
failed to discharge its duties in the place where the public
business with which he is charged is conducted, subject to
examination by any of the committees appointed by the
General Assembly, and upon an application for mandamus to compel him to perform this obvious public duty,
it is essential for the court to ascertain the facts and inform itself whether there has been an actual removal of
public documents or other public property and a refusal
to restore them for examination." In State v. Donovan,
10 N. Dak. 203, the defendant was a druggist who was
required by statute to keep a record of all sales of intoxicating liquors made by him, which should be subject to
public inspection at reasonable times. It was held that
the privilege against self-crimination was not available to
him with respect to the books kept under the law, for they
were "public documents, which the defendant was required to keep, not for his private uses, but for the benefit
of the public, and for public inspection."
On similar
grounds in State v. Davis, 108 Missouri, 666, the court
sustained a statute requiring druggists to preserve the
prescriptions they compounded and to produce them in
court when required. See also State v. Davis, 69 S. E. Rep.
(W. Va.) 639; People v. Coombs, 158 N. Y. 532; L. & N.
R. R. Co. v. Commonwealth, 51 S. W. Rep. (Ky.) 167;
State v. Smith, 74 Iowa, 580; State v. Cummins, 76 Iowa,
133; People v. Henwood, 123 Michigan, 317; Langdon v.
People, 133 Illinois, 382.
The fundamental ground of decision in this class of

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

cases, is that where, by virtue of their character and the
rules of law applicable to them, the books and papers are
held subject to examination by the demanding authority,
the custodian has no privilege to refuse production although their contents tend to criminate him. In assuming
their custody he has accepted the incident obligation to
permit inspection.
What then is the status of the books and papers of a
corporation, which has not been created as a mere instrumentality of government, but has been formed pursuant to voluntary agreement and hence is called a
private corporation? They are not public records in the
sense that they relate to public transactions, or, in the
absence of particular requirements, are open to general
inspection or must be kept or filed in a special manner.
They have reference to business transacted for the benefit of the group of individuals whose association has the
advantage of corporate organization. But the corporate
form of business activity, with its chartered privileges,
raises a distinction when the authority of government
demands the examination of books. That demand, expressed in lawful process, confining its requirements
within the limits which reason imposes in the circumstances of the case, the corporation has no privilege to
refuse. It cannot resist production upon the ground of
self-crimination. Although the object of the inquiry may
be to detect the abuses it has committed, to discover its
violations of law and to inflict punishment by forfeiture
of franchises or otherwise, it must submit its books and
papers to duly constituted authority when demand is
suitably made. This is involved in the reservation of the
visitatorial power of the State, and in the authority
of the National Government where the corporate activities are in the domain subject to the powers of
Congress.
This view, and the reasons which support it, have so

221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

recently been stated by this court in the case of Hale v.
Henkel, supra, that it is unnecessary to do more than to
refer to what was there said (pp. 74, 75):
"Conceding that the witness was an officer of the corporation under investigation, and that he was entitled to
assert the rights of the corporation with respect to the
production of its books and papers, we are of the opinion
that there is a clear distinction in this particular between
an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has
no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an
examination at the suit of the State. The individual may
stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is
entitled to carry on his private business in his own way.
His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to
the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to
open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend
to criminate him. He owes no such duty to the State,
since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by
due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from
arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He
owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass
upon their rights.
"Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of
the State. It is presumed to be incorporated for the
benefit of the public. It receives certain special privileges
and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the
State and the limitations of its charter. Its powers are
limited by law. It can make no contract not authorized
by its charter. Its rights to act as a corporation are only
preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation.
There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate

221 U. S.

its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its
powers. It would be a strange anomaly to hold that a
State, having chartered a corporation to make use of
certain franchises, could not in the exercise of its sovereignty inquire how these franchises had been employed,
and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose. The defense amounts to this: That an officer of a
corporation, which is charged with a criminal violation of
the statute, may plead the criminality of such corporation
as a refusal to produce its books. To state this proposition
is to answer it. While an individual may lawfully refuse
to answer incriminating questions unless protected by an
immunity statute, it does not follow that a corporation,
vested with special privileges and franchises, may refuse
to show its hand when charged with an abuse of such privileges.
" .
Being subject to this dual sovereignty, the
General Government possesses the same right to see that
its own laws are respected as the State would have with
respect to the special franchises vested in it by the laws of
the State. The powers of the General Government in
this particular in the vindication of its own laws, are the
same as if the corporation had been created by an act of
Congress. It is not intended to intimate, however, that
it has a general visitatorial, power over state corporations
tions." See also Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont,
207 U. S. 541; Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212
U. S. 322, pp. 348, 349.
The appellant held the corporate books subject to the
corporate duty. If the corporation were guilty of misconduct, he could not withhold its books to save it; and
if he were implicated in the violations of law, he could
not withhold the books to protect himself from the effect
of their disclosures. The reserved power of visitation
would seriously be embarrassed, if not wholly defeated in

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

its effective exercise, if guilty officers could refuse inspection of the records and papers of the corporation.
No personal privilege to which they are entitled requires
such a conclusion. It would not be a recognition, but an
unjustifiable extension, of the personal rights they enjoy.
They may decline to utter upon the witness stand a
single self-criminating word. They may demand that
any accusation against them individually be established
without the aid of their oral testimony or the compulsory
production by them of their private papers. But the
visitatorial power which exists with respect to the corporation of necessity reaches the corporate books without regard to the conduct of the custodian.
Nor is it an answer to say that in the present case the
inquiry before the grand jury was not directed against
the corporation itself. The appellant had no greater
right to withhold the books by reason of the fact that the
corporation was not charged with criminal abuses. That,
if the corporation had been so charged, he would have
been compelled to submit the books to inspection, despite
the consequences to himself, sufficiently shows the absence
of any basis for a claim on his part of personal privilege
as to them; it could not depend upon the question whether
or not another was accused. The only question was
whether as against the corporation the books were lawfully required in the administration of justice. When the
appellant became president of the corporation and as
such held and used its books for the transaction of its
business committed to his charge, he was at all times
subject to its direction, and the books continuously remained under its control. If another took his place his
custody would yield. He could assert no personal right
to retain the corporate books against any demand of
government which the corporation was bound to recognize.

Rex v. Cornelius, 2 Stra. 1210), but these cannot be deemed
controlling. The corporate duty, and the relation of the
appellant as the officer of the corporation to its discharge,
are to be determined by our laws. Nothing more is
demanded than that the appellant should perform the
obligations pertaining to his custody and should produce
the books which he holds in his official capacity in accordance with the requirements of the subpoena. None
of his personal papers are subject to inspection under the
writ and his action, in refusing to permit the examination
of the corporate books demanded, fully warranted his
commitment for contempt.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA dissenting.

I am unable to concur with my brethren, and if the
application of a constitutional provision, indeed a constitutional provision whose purpose is the protection of
personal liberty, were not involved I might not even signify opposition. The application of the Constitution of
the United States, especially as it may affect personal
privileges, is the most serious duty of the court. It is
sure to have consequence beyond the instance, and justifies the expression of the views a member of the court may
have about it.
The facts are stated in the opinion, but they are not all
of equal significance, indeed may confuse unless distinguished. I put to one side, therefore, all consideration
of the process by which the letter-press books were brought
into court or before the grand jury. They were taken there,
of course, in deference-in submission, it may be better
to say-to the command of the law expressed in the sub-

pcena. Resistance to that was not offered by Wilson, nor
was it necessary. Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616.
His constitutional right was asserted afterwards. With
Wilson then and the books in his possession we have to
deal and the rights he had in such situation, and let us
keep in mind that it was his guilt under the law that was
under investigation and which the books were sought for
the purpose of exposing. Three indictments had already
been found against him. Crime, therefore, had been
formally charged, and further crime was being investigated-not crime by the corporation, but crime by him,
and the proof, it was supposed, lay in the books. They
were sought for no other reason. They were demanded of
him to convict him. To the demand he answered that
the Constitution of his country protected him from producing evidence against himself. And he was certainly
asked to produce such evidence. The books were in his
possession in an assertion of right over them against everybody. In the transactions they recorded he was a participant, and, it may be, the only doer. It is made something
of in the opinion that the corporation was willing to have
the books surrendered. The more unmistakable, therefore, was the claim of Wilson a personal privilege. And let
it be kept in mind that it was his own privilege that he
claimed, not that of the corporation; and I pass by as
irrelevant a consideration of what disclosures could have
been required of it, even if it had been accused of crime
and there had been pending an inquiry against it.
Upon what ground was the privilege denied? Upon
the ground that the books were not his property but that
of the corporation, and they are assimilated in the opinion
to public documents, a consideration I pass for the present.
How far, as affecting the privilege, is the rule of the title
to property to be carried? Every rule may be tested by
what can be done under it. Whenever a privilege is
claimed against the production of books, or, of course other

property, may an issue be raised as to title and upon its
decision by the court the right to the privilege be determined, or shall the rule only be applied when such issue
is not made? And what of partnership property, or property otherwise owned in common? Does the degree of
interest affect the rule? In the case at bar Wilson asserted
the right to hold the books against the corporation. However, such considerations are, in my view, of minor importance, and I instance them only to show to what uncertainties we may go when we leave the clear and simple
directness of the privilege against self-incrimination. As
the privilege is a guaranty of personal liberty it should
not be qualified by construction and a distinction based
on the ownership of the books demanded as evidence is
immaterial. Such distinction has not been regarded except in the case of public records, as will be exhibited by
a review of the authorities.
In Rex. v. Granatelli, Reports of State Trials, New
Series, 979, 986, Prince Granatelli was prosecuted for
breach of the Foreign Enlistment Act in fitting out certain
vessels to be used in hostilities against the King of the
Two Sicilies. A witness was subpoenaed to produce an
agreement whereby Granatelli agreed to buy the vessels
of a certain navigation company of which the witness was
the secretary. The witness refused to produce it, on the
ground that it might contain matter that might criminate
himself or other parties for whom he was interested. It
was ruled that he could not be compelled to produce the
agreement.
In Rex v. Cornelius, 2 Strange, 1210, an information
was granted against the defendants, who were justices
of the peace, for taking money for granting licenses to
alehouse keepers. A rule was applied for to inspect the
books of the corporation. It was refused, on the ground
that it would in effect oblige a defendant indicted for
misdemeanor to furnish evidence against himself.

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

McKENNA, J., dissenting.

In Rex v. Purnell, 1 W. B1. 37, an information was
exhibited against the defendant, who was the Vice
Chancellor of Oxford, for neglect of his duty in not
punishing certain persons who had spoken treasonable
words in the streets of Oxford. The Attorney General
moved for a rule directed to the proper officers of the
university to permit their books and archives to be inspected to furnish evidence against the defendant. The
motion was attempted to be supported "on a suggestion
that the King, being a visitor of the university, had a right
to inspect their books whenever he thought proper." It
was argued besides that "when a man is a magistrate, and
as such has books in his custody, his having the office
shall not secrete those books which another Vice Chancellor must have produced." The rule was refused, the
court saying: "We know no instance wherein this court
has granted a rule to inspect books in a criminal prosecution nakedly considered." The corporations in those cases
were considered as private, as observed by Wigmore on
Evidence, notes to § 2259. For the same reason, in Rex v.
Worsenham, 1 Ld. Raym. 705, the production of customhouse books in an information against custom-house officers for forging a custom-house bond were not compelled.
And in Regina v. Mead, 2 Ld. Raym. 927, books of the
defendant who, with eight others, were incorporated as
highway surveyors, being considered of a private nature,
were not required to be produced. Such corporations
would, no doubt, be regarded to-day as public, as observed by Wigmore, and he cites cases in which certain
records were deemed public, as follows: In a libel suit a
parish vestry book required by statute to be kept; registered pharmacist's reports filed as required by law; in a
criminal prosecution for unlawful railroad charges, a
tariff sheet publicly posted; a druggist's record of sales
kept under a statute to charge him with illegal liquor
selling. By a statute in Massachusetts, "no official paper

or record" produced by a witness at a legislative hearing
is to be within the privilege against self-crimination.
As a deduction from the cases I have cited the rule is
laid down in Wigmore on Evidence to be: "Where the
corporation's misconduct involves also the claimant's misconduct, or where the document is in reality the personal
act of the claimant, though nominally that of the corporation, the disclosures are virtually his own, and to that
extent his privilege protects him from producing them."
It would unduly extend this opinion to review the cases
which are said to oppose Wigmore's deduction, but as
Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, is cited in the opinion of the
court, I will refer to it briefly.
It was there held that an officer of a corporation could
not refuse to produce its books on the ground that they
would criminate the corporation. What privilege an
officer of the corporation had from producing the books
on the ground that they might criminate him was not
necessary to decide, as immunity from prosecution was
given by statute for any matter as to which he should
testify. It may be contended that it is a natural inference
from the decision that but for the immunity granted he
could have claimed such privilege. See also Nelson v.
United States, 201 U. S. 92. Circuit Judge Gilbert, in a
well-considered opinion in Ex parte Chapman, 153 Fed.
Rep. 153, made such deduction from Hale v. Henkel, and
discharged Chapman from custody to which he had been
committed for refusing to produce for the inspection of a
grand jury the books and papers belonging to a corporation of which he was an officer.
The weight of authority, therefore, is against the power
of a court to compel the production of books of a private
corporation by any one whom they would criminate. And
the cases seem right on principle. The spirit of the privilege is that a witness shall not be used in any way to his
crimination. When that may be the effect of any evidence

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

McKENNA,

J., dissenting.

required of him, be it oral or documentary, he may resist.
He cannot be made use of at all to secure the evidence.
This must necessarily be the extent of the privilege. Rex v.
Purnell, supra, is specially in point. The Solicitor General
for the crown, replying to the objection that no one was
bound to furnish evidence against himself, said, "Agreed,
but a distinction may be made. When a man is a magistrate, and as such has books in his custody, his having
the office shall not secrete those books, which another
Vice Chancellor must have produced. Besides, the statutes are not in the Vice Chancellor's custody only, but also
in the hands of the Custos Archivorum."
And the constitutional protection is not measured by
the effect, great or small, on the prosecution. It may be
invoked even though the prosecution may be defeated.
It is the contemplation of the provision of the Constitution that such may be the result and that it is less evil than
requiring a person to aid in his conviction of crime.
Neither plausible arguments therefore nor considerations
of expediency should prevail against or limit a principle
deemed important enough to be made constitutional.
Such a principle should be adhered to firmly. It is said
in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 635, that "constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal
construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and
leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted
more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of courts
to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,
and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their
motto should be obsta principiis."
In a case of seizure and forfeiture of certain property
under the customs-revenue laws for fraudulent invoicing,
Boyd entered a claim for the property. Before the trial
it became important to know the quantity and value of
the property. In obedience to an order issued by the court

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

221 U. S.

under a statute of the United States, Boyd produced the
invoice of the property, but objected to inspection, on
the ground that in a suit for forfeiture no evidence can
be compelled from the claimants, and also that the statute,
so far as it compelled production of the evidence to be
used against him, was unconstitutional and void. It was
held that the order of the court and the statute violated
both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, notwithstanding that the statute
could trace its purpose back to one passed in 1863, which
had been sustained by decisions in the Circuit and District
Courts, and notwithstanding it also had been sustained
by such decisions. The case has been criticised, but it
has endured and has become the foundation of other
decisions. Indeed, eminent legal names may be cited in
criticism, if not ridicule, of the policy expressed by the
Fifth Amendment, that is, the policy of protection against
self-crimination. It is declared to have no logical relation
to the abuses that are said to sustain it, and that the pretense for it, so far as based on hardship, is called an "old
woman's reason," (also a "lawyer's reason,") and a
"double distilled and treble refined sentimentality." So
far as based on unfairness it is called "the fox hunter's
reason," its basis being that a criminal and a fox must have
a chance to escape, the subsequent pursuit being nade
thereby more interesting. And it is asked, supposing a
witness upon the stand in a prosecution for robbery, "a
question is put, the effect of which were he to answer it,
might be to subject him to conviction in respect to another
robbery, attended with murder (such high offenses give
emphasis to the argument), on the ground of public utility
and common sense is there any reason why the collateral
advantage thus proffered by fortune to justice should be
foregone?" Bentham on Judicial Evidence, vol. 5, page

no other concern than the punishment of crime.

WILSON v. UNITED STATES.
221 U. S.

MCKENNA,

J., dissenting.

If the Government had no other concern, short-cuts
to conviction would be justified and commendable in
proportion to their shortness. The general warrants which
John Wilkes resisted were such a cut; so were writs of
assistance issued in Colonial times. Their inducement
was the detection of crime, and yet popular rights were
vindicated in the resistance to the first, and the "child
Independence was born" by resistance to the second.
I will not pause to vindicate the privilege of the Fifth
Amendment against considerations of expediency nor to
inquire whether it is a well-reasoned principle, one logically following from abuses, properly adapted to the facts
of life when it was adopted, or if so then, not now. It has
passed from polemics and has secured the sanction of constitutional law. Courts cannot change it, or add to it or
take from it to suit the "condition of modern civilization,"
as it was suggested in a case submitted with this. It is as
vital now as when ordained and is not uncertain. It is
plain and direct as to the source of criminating evidence.
The accused person cannot be made the source. What
Lord Camden denominated "an argument of utility"
should not prevail now as it did not in Westminster Hall
when he pronounced his great judgment against general
warrants. Indeed English courts, as I have shown, have
never wavered nor felt constrained by the demands of
criminal justice to depart from or qualify in any way the
strength of the privilege. Is it possible that a written
constitution is more flexible in its adaptations than an
unwritten one, and that the spirit of English liberty is
firmer or more consistent than that of American liberty,
or discerns more clearly the danger of relaxing the strictness of any of the guarantees of personal rights?
A limitation by construction of any of the constitutional
securities for personal liberty is to be deprecated. A people
may grow careless and overlook at what cost and through
what travail they acquired even the least of their liberties.

Syllabus.

The process of deterioration is simple. It may even be
conceived to be advancement, and that intelligent selfgovernment can be trusted to adapt itself to occasion, not
needing the fetters of a predetermined rule. It may come
to be considered that a constitution is the cradle of infancy, that a nation grown up may boldly advance in
confident security against the abuses of power and that
passion will not sway more than reason. But what of the
end when the lessons of history are ignored, when the
barriers erected by wisdom gathered from experience are
weakened or destroyed? And weakened or destroyed they
may be when interest and desire feel their restraint. What
then of the end; will history repeat itself? And this is
not a cry of alarm. "Obsta principiis" was the warning
of Mr. Justice Bradley in Boyd v. United States against
the attempt of the Government to break down the constitutional privilege of the citizen by attempting to exact
from him evidence of fraud against the customs laws. I
repeat the warning. The present case is another attempt
of the same kind and should be treated in the same way.
