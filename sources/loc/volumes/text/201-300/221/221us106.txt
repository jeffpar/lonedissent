OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Syllabus.

221 U. S.

I do not stop to discuss the merits of the policy embodied in the Anti-trust Act of 1890; for, as has been often adjudged, the courts, under our constitutional system, have
no rightful concern with the wisdom or policy of legislation enacted by that branch of the Government which
alone can make laws.
For the reasons stated, while concurring in the general
affirmance of the decree of the Circuit Court, I dissent from
that part of the judgment of this court which directs the
modification of the decree of the Circuit Court, as well as
from those parts of the opinion which, in effect, assert
authority, in this court, to insert words in the Anti-trust
Act which Congress did not put there, and which, being
inserted, Congress is made to declare, as part of the public
policy of the country, what it has not chosen to declare.

AMERICAN

TOBACCO COMPANY v. UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.

APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
Nos. 118, 119. Argued January 3, 4, 5, 6, 1910; restored to docket for reargument April 11, 1910; reargued January 9, 10, 11, 12, 1911.-Decided
May 29, 1911.

Standard Oil Co. v. United States, ante, p. 1, followed and reaffirmed
as to the construction to be given to the Anti-trust Act of July 2,
1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209; and held that the combination in this case
is one in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize the business of tobacco in interstate commerce within the prohibitions of
the act.

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 107
221 U. S.

Syllabus.

In order to meet such a situation as is presented by the record in this
case and to afford the relief for the evils to be overcome, the Antitrust Act of 1890 must be given a more comprehensive application
than affixed to it in any previous decision.
In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, ante, p. 1, the words "restraint of
trade" as used in § 1 of the Anti-trust Act were properly construed
by the resort to reason; the doctrine stated in that case was in accord
with all previous decisions of this court, despite the contrary view at
times erroneously attributed to the expressions in United States v.
Trans-MissouriFreight Association, 166 U. S. 290, and United States
v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505.
The Anti-trust Act must have a reasonable construction as there can
scarcely be any agreement or contract among business men that
does not directly or indirectly affect and possibly restrain commerce.
United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505, 568.
The words "restraint of trade" at common law, and in the law of this
country at the time of the adoption of the Anti-trust Act, only embraced acts, contracts, agreements or combinations which operated
to the prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition or by unduly obstructing due course of trade, and Congress
intended that those words as used in that act should have a like
significance; and the ruling in Standard Oil Co. v. United States,
ante, p. 1, to this effect is re~xpressed and reaffirmed.
The public policy manifested by the Anti-trust Act is expressed in
such general language that it embraces every conceivable act which
can possibly come within the spirit of its prohibitions, and that
policy cannot be frustrated by resort to disguise or subterfuge of
any kind.
The record in this case discloses a combination on the part of the defendants with the purpose of acquiring dominion and control of
interstate commerce in tobacco by methods and manners clearly
within the prohibition of the Anti-trust Act; and the subjectmatters of the combination and the combination itself are not excluded from the scope of the act as being matters of intrastate commerce and subject to state control.
In this case the combination in all its aspects both as to stock ownership, and as to the corporations independently, including foreign
corporations to the extent that they became coiperators in the
combination, come within the prohibition of the first and second
sections of the Anti-trust Act.
In giving relief against an unlawful combination under the Anti-trust
Act the court should give complete and efficacious effect to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

221 U. S.

prohibitions of the statute; accomplish this result with as little injury as possible to the interest of the general public; and have a
proper regard for the vested property interests innocently acquired.
In this case the combination in and of itself, and also all of its constituent elements, are decreed to be illegal, and the court below is
directed to hear the parties and ascertain and determine a plan or
method of dissolution and of recreating a condition in harmony with
law, to be carried out within a reasonable period (in this case not to
exceed eight months), and, if necessary, to effectuate this result
either by injunction or receivership.
Pending the achievement of the result decreed all parties to the combination in this case should be restrained and enjoined from enlarging the power of the continuation by any means or device
whatever.
Where a case is remanded, as this one is, to the lower court with directions
to grant the relief in a different manner from that decreed by it, the
proper course is not to modify and affirm, but to reverse and remand
with directions to enter a decree in conformity with the opinion and
to carry out the directions of this court with costs to defendants.
164 Fed. Rep. 700, reversed and remanded with directions.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the Antitrust Act of July 2, 1890, and the question whether the
acts of the defendants amounted to a combination in restraint of interstate commerce in tobacco, are stated in the
opinion.
The Attorney General and Mr. James C. McReynolds
for the United States:
What constitutes or materially affects interstate or
foreign commerce is a practical question to be decided
upon a view of the facts presented in each case. Rearick
v. Pennsylvania, 203 U. S. 507, 512; Western Union Tel.
Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1; International Text Book
Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91; Dozier v. Alabama, 218 U. S.
124. In the constantly recurring course of affairs commerce among the States passes through three stages:
soliciting orders; manufacturing the goods; transporting
them to the purchaser. And each is an essential of the
entire movement. Soliciting orders undoubtedly is inter-

Argument for the United States.

state commerce, Robbins v. Shelby County, 120 U. S. 489.
Transporting the manufactured article likewise is clearly
of the same. The manufacture is as essential as either of
the other elements; and some restrictions upon it, as all
know, affect the very foundations of interstate trade.
The commerce clause gives Congress power to indicate
its will in conformity to which interstate commerce shall
be carried on. This is supreme and admittedly extends to
whatever is itself interstate commerce, and all instrumentalities and persons engaged therein. Legislation
which directly regulates any of these things comes clearly
within the constitutional grant. Delaware & Hudson
R. R. Co. v. United States, 213 U. S. 366. And, consequently, whenever manufacture can be regarded as a
part of such commerce Congress may inhibit a monopoly
thereof, as in so doing it would be directly regulating
commerce.
The granted power may be made effective by all means
reasonably necessary therefor. Experience demonstrates
that the indicated will of Congress concerning interstate
trade and commerce may be directly hindered, obstructed
and nullified by some things which are no part thereof.
Whatever of these, therefore, as an efficient cause, will
probably occasion as a natural and reasonable consequence material obstruction or hindrance to the efficacious operation of its lawful will, Congress may prohibit.
A monopoly of production, as the efficient cause, may occasion material hindrance or obstruction to such operation of the indicated will of Congress, and in that event
may be prohibited because of this effect although manufacture be regarded as no part of commerce. Gibbons v.
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,195, 208, 209; United States v. Coombes,
12 Pet. 72, 78; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557.
Where matters of economic opinion or theory are elements for consideration and conclusions depend thereon,
the courts must accept whatever declaration Congress has

made in respect of them, and frame their judgments in
harmony therewith, unless such declaration is plainly
without reasonable foundation. National Cotton Oil Co.
v. Texas, 197 U. S. 115.
Contracts, combinations, conspiracies and monopolies
which directly and materially hindered or obstructed interstate or foreign commerce were unlawful prior to the
act of July 2, 1890.
The principles of the common law are applicable to
interstate commerce transactions. Western Union Telegraph Company v. Call, 181 U. S. 92, 102. Without congressional enactment, every contract, combination, conspiracy or monopoly, unlawful at common law, would be
so regarded by the Federal courts although relating solely
to interstate or foreign commerce; and certainly no affirmative aid would be given to the purposes of any of
them.
Congress has power "To Regulate Commerce with
Foreign Nations, and Among the Several States, and with
the Indian Tribes." Except as limited by other provisions, this power is supreme and cannot be abridged by
State, individual or corporation.
Inaction by Congress indicates its will that interstate
and international commerce shall be free; and therefore
whatever substantially obstructs, interferes with or hampers such commerce conflicts with the will of Congress and
the Federal Constitution. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100;
Re Rahrer, 140 U. S. 545; Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412;
Adams Express Co. v. Kentucky, 206 U. S. 129, 135; Atlantic Coast Line v. Wharton, 207 U. S. 328, 334; Adams
Express Co. v. Kentucky, 214 U. S. 218.
The doctrine that inaction by Congress is equivalent
to a positive declaration that commerce shall be free and
untrammeled and that whatever substantially interferes
with or hampers the same is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States rests upon the intention of

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 111
221 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

Congress reasonably implied from its silence in respect
to the subject of commerce. Bowman v. Chicago &c. R. R.
Co., 125 U. S. 465, 482.
Contracts, combinations, conspiracies and monopolies
may and often do prevent the free flow of commerce-substantially obstruct, interfere with and hamper the same.
Addyston Pipe Case, 175 U. S. 211; Loewe v. Lawlor, 208
U. S. 274.
If state legislation which substantially hinders or obstructs commerce is invalid, because in conflict with the
contrary intention of Congress reasonably implied from
silence, a fortiori is this true of any arrangements by corporations which bring about like results.
In the absence of express legislation any contract, combination, or other arrangement by corporations which
directly and materially hinders, restrains or obstructs the
free flow of interstate or foreign commerce would be unlawful. Re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 577, 599; Union Bridge
Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. 364; Galveston R. R. v.
Texas, 210 U. S. 217; Caldwell v. North Carolina, 187 U. S.
622. How far the courts, in the absence of a statute, could
prevent and restrain such obstructions, or whether parties thereto might be prosecuted criminally, it is not necessary to discuss, since the Anti-trust Act now clearly
applies to them.
The anti-trust provisions of the Wilson Tariff Act
(1894) apply to any combination or agreement intended
to restrain free competition when one of the parties is engaged in importing.
These provisions have not been construed by this court.
They denounce every combination, one party to which is
engaged in importing, when intended to restrain lawful
commerce or free competition therein. The language differs somewhat from the Sherman Act, not improbably
because of prior opinions in the lower Federal courts. Re

Freight Assn., 53 Fed. Rep. 440; 58 Fed. Rep. 58; United
States v. E. C. Knight Co., 60 Fed. Rep. 934.
The Sherman Act prescribes the rule of free competition in its broad and general sense and denounces contracts, combinations and conspiracies in whatever form
which in effect or necessary tendency directly and materially obstruct interstate or foreign commerce. The
natural effect of competition is to increase commerce; to
extinguish or prevent the free play of competition is to
hinder it.
The rights of an individual acting alone are not involved in the present controversy. (Concurring opinion
of Justice Brewer in Northern Securities Case.)
The record reveals gross violations of the anti-trust
statutes within any construction consistent with repeated decisions of this court; if limited to unreasonable
restraints the present case would be clearly within them.
And if duress, and wicked and unfair methods are essential,
they all appear.
Interstate commerce is a term of very large significance.
It comprehends intercourse for the purposes of trade in
any and all forms, including transportation, purchase, sale
and exchange of commodities between citizens of different
States. Regulation and commerce are both practical conceptions, and their limits must be fixed by practical lines.
Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211; Caldwell
v. North Carolina, 187 U. S.622, 632; Montague & Co. v.
Lowry, 193 U. S.38; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S.
375; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, 203 U. S.507, 512; Galveston
R. R. v. Texas, 210 U. S.217, 225.
The anti-trust laws must be reasonably construed with
a view to practical enforcement, and not so as to defeat the
purposes leading to their enactment. "Nothing is better
settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention,
and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd

conclusion." Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S. 47,
59; United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505,
567; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, 600; Anderson v. United States, 171 U. S. 604, 616; Swift & Company
v. United States, 196 U. S. 375, 396; Cincinnati Packet
Company v. Bay, 200 U. S. 179, 184.
The general principles adopted in reference to state
legislation affecting interstate commerce are applicable
for determining whether combinations of corporations or
individuals materially affect the free flow of such commerce. The validity of such state legislation turns upon
whether its direct effect or necessary tendency is the material or substantial restraint, hindrance or obstruction of
commerce. If so, it is unconstitutional irrespective of
intent. But if the effect is only immaterial and incidental
this does not invalidate. Asbell v. Kansas, 209 U. S. 251,
256; Galveston &c. R. R. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217, 227;
Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313, 319; Richmond &c,

U. S. 465, 482; Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, 473.
The Sherman Act applies when the direct result or necessary tendency of the prohibited thing-contract, combination, etc.-is material obstruction, hindrance or restraint of interstate or foreign commerce. This thing need
not be any part of commerce, nor be done by parties engaged therein. And whether such obstruction, hindrance,
restraint or tendency exists must be determined by the
court upon the facts of each case. That which did not restrain commerce fifty years ago may do so to-day. Loewe
v. Lawlor, 208 U. S.274, 293; Union Bridge Company v.
United States, 204 U. S.364, 400; Pennsylvaniav. Wheeling
Bridge Co., 13 How. 518, and 18 How. 421.
The settled rule, and one constantly invoked by those
engaged in interstate commerce, is that any state statute

221 U. S.

which in effect or necessary tendency directly and materially obstructs or hinders the free flow of interstate commerce conflicts with the Federal Constitution. Certainly
one purpose of the Sherman Act was to prevent any such
interference with commerce through contracts, combinations, conspiracies or monopolies (Loewe v. Lawlor), and
if state statutes are cut down because of congressional intent inferred from silence, there can be no question of the
power of Congress by a positive enactment to destroy
obnoxious arrangements amongst individuals or corporations. The interpretation of the Sherman Act expounded
in the unanimous opinion in Loewe v. Lawlor supports this
suggestion.
The natural effect of competition in its broad and legitimate sense is to increase trade. To suppress such competition restrains, hinders and obstructs trade within the
meaning of the Anti-trust Act. United States v. TransMissouri Freight Assn., 166 U. S. 290; United States v.
Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505; Addyston Pipe Co. v.
United States, 175 U. S. 211; Northern Securities Co. v.
United States, 193 U. S. 197; United States v. Standard Oil
Co., 173 Fed. Rep. 177. This rule is especially rigid in respect of public service corporations. Gibbs v. Consolidated
Gas Co., 130 U. S. 396; United States v. Trans-Missouri
Freight Assn., 166 U. S. 290; but it is applicable to all
commerce.
Persons of sound mind are presumed to intend the necessary or ordinary consequences of their acts, Clarion
Bank v. Jones, 21 Wall. 325, 337; and, in general, the
intent consciously entertained or dominant in the minds of
parties to a combination is not material-certainly not
decisive of its legality. Where attempts to monopolize are
charged, or where essential to show a plan not necessarily
inferred from circumstances, or where the effect of established acts may be doubtful, the actual purpose may be
material-perhaps essential, United States v. Trans-Mo.

Ft. Assn., 166 U. S. 290, 341, 342; Addyston Pipe Co. v.
United States, 175 U. S. 211, 234; Swift & Co. v. United
States, 196 U. S. 375, 396.
The fundamental design of the anti-trust legislation is
not punishment of immorality, but prevention of mischief
consequent upon unification of control and destruction of
competition. The public is chiefly concerned about practical results-not mental attitudes. The lawfulness of a
combination cannot be determined by the conscious purpose of the parties; necessary consequences are presumed
to have been intended. United States v. Trans-Mo. Ft.
Assn., 166 U. S. 290; United States v. Joint Traffic Assn.,
171 U. S. 562; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175
U. S. 211, 234.
The word "unreasonable" cannot be read into the first
section of the Sherman Act; but this does not render the
prohibitions applicable merely because commerce is in
some way affected, or to transactions always enforceable,
and never regarded as objectionable from any standpoint.
This court has never declared unlawful those ordinary
business arrangements always sanctioned at common law
and wholly outside the mischief intended to be prevented.
Any act, however, although entirely innocent when standing alone may be criminal if part of an unlawful plan.
United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505, 567,
568; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U. S. 578, 600; Aikens
v. Wisconsin, 195 U. S. 194, 205; Swift & Company v.
United States, 196 U. S. 375, 396; CincinnatiPacket Co. v.
Bay, 200 U. S. 179.
The Government does not maintain that restraint, obstruction or hindrance of* commerce is denounced by the
act unless direct and material either in tendency or effect;
and, of course, do not insist that every contract or arrangement which merely eliminates a competitor in interstate trade is for that sole reason unlawful. The statute
was intended to foster, not destroy, business operations

universally regarded as promotive of public welfare. The
suggestion that the statute denounces as criminal every
party to any sort of contract which eliminates any independent dealer in interstate commerce however insignificant is untenable. But when, as in the present case, the
restraint is the direct consequence of or that to which the
challenged contract or combination necessarily tends, and
is also of a material or substantial character it is clearly
within the prohibition. The Government does not
avouch and will not attempt to support this extreme construction which was adopted by the presiding judge below.
Contracts, combinations or conspiracies which give
power materially to restrain commerce and indicate a
dangerous probability of its exercise and those which
necessarily tend to monopoly are unlawful without more.
United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1; United
States v. Trans-MissouriFt. Assn., 166 U. S. 290; Northern
Securities Company v. United States, 193 U. S. 197; United
States v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Fed. Rep. 177. The essential purpose of the statute is to prevent injury-not merely
to reverse a course of conduct.
The words, "contract, combination and conspiracy"
in the statute are used in their ordinary sense, and there
is no exception in favor of sales, conveyances or other executed arrangements. Pettibone v. United States, 148
U. S. 197, 203; Noyes on Intercorporate Relations, §§ 324
et seq.
The decision in United States v. E. C. Knight Company
turned upon the conclusion that under the peculiar circumstances of that case what was alleged and proved did
not show a direct or necessary obstruction to interstate
commerce; and it may be relied upon only where the evidence requires a like finding on that point. The facts of
the present case render such a conclusion impossible. The
things done had direct reference to interstate and foreign

commerce; competition therein has been effectively destroyed and monopoly secured. In support of the foregoing doctrines, see United States v. E. C. Knight Company (1895), 156 U. S. 1; Pearsallv. Great Northern R. R.

Monopoly is the outcome of the practical cessation of
effective business competition. This word in the AntiTrust Act has no reference to a grant of special privileges
but is used in a broad sense. Trade and commerce in any
commodity are monopolized whenever as the result of the
concentration of competing businesses-not occurring as
an incident to the orderly growth and development of one
of them-one or a few corporations (or persons) acting in
concert practically acquire power to control prices and
smother competition.
The rights of an individual acting alone are not involved and it is unnecessary to inquire how far his acts

221 U. S.

may be limited. Corporations do not have all the constitutional rights of an individual and are themselves
combinations subject to the rules of law applicable to acts
done in concert.
The word "monopolize" has no reference to a governmental grant. Congress was striking at an existing evilunification of control with consequent destruction of competition through powerful organizations. The essential
idea of monopoly is ability to control prices or to deprive
the public of advantages flowing from free competition.
Whether the power has been actually exercised, or prices
or the total volume of trade increased or diminished is immaterial; and its existence must be determined by practical consideration of existing conditions, giving due weight
to the peculiarities of the commerce involved. It is certain that where parties have deliberately pursued a course,
the ordinary result or necessary tendency of which is
monopoly, they cannot be heard to deny an unlawful intent; and a monopoly acquired through contract, combination or conspiracy Which directly and essentially destroys
competition clearly is unlawful. United States v. TransMo. Ft. Assn., 166 U. S. 290; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United
States, 175 U. S. 211; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196
U. S. 375.
The courts have long referred to "monopoly" the outcome of individual action as distinguished from governmental grant, and have declared unlawful every arrangement tending thereto. The word in the Sherman Act has
the same significance as in the well-known opinions, from
Mitchell v. Reynolds, 1 P. Williams, 181, to Continental
Wall Paper Co. v. Voight, 212 U. S. 227; United States v.

The legislation against combinations and monopolies
cannot be defeated by causing a corporation to acquire the
shares or property and business of competing corporations; nor by any other scheme or device.
Corporate combinations which bring about the results
denounced by the statute are unlawful. They are in
fact more injurious to the public than the old forms of
simple agreement among separate concerns or the wellknown trust forms. Eddy on Combinations, Vol. I, §§ 617,
620 et seq.; Noyes on Intercorporate Relations, § 307; Distillery Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 448.
If the corporate form of combination is beyond the
reach of Congress, it lacks supreme power to regulate commerce. Certainly a corporation, a mere creature of state
law, cannot be endowed with power to obstruct commerce
not possessed by the State itself. Deb's Case, 158 U. S.
564; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211;
Northern Securities Case, 193 U. S. 197.
The right to buy, sell and transfer property is not superior to the right to make other contracts; and all are subordinate to the power of Congress to regulate commerce.

power to suppress competition is no less inimical to public
interests than a technical "Trust," and indeed is often a
mere modification thereof. The direct, necessary result
of such an arrangement is to hinder and obstruct commerce. The Pearsall Case, 161 U. S. 644; Northern Securities Case, 193 U. S. 344; Shawnee Compress Case, 209

There is no foundation for the claim that the Sherman
Act was directed only against contracts and combinations
of an executory nature, and is without application where
transfers of property have been actually executed. It
was intended to, and does, prohibit obstructions to commerce whether resulting from executory or executed arrangements. Northern Securities Case, 193 U. S. 197;

A foreign corporation doing business within the United
States has no right to violate its policy or laws. An
agreement or combination which in purpose or effect conflicts therewith, although actually made in a foreign country where not unlawful, gives no immunity to parties acting here in pursuance of it.
If Congress is powerless to prevent wrongs in its own
jurisdiction, when the actors are foreigners, or when done
in pursuance of agreements made abroad, its sovereignty
is a myth.
A crime is committed within the jurisdiction where the
act of the parties actually takes effect, although the in-

strumentalities may have been set in motion in another

The courts should enforce the anti-trust legislation by
all appropriate processes known to their usages; and decrees should be so moulded as to suppress effectually the
mischief consequent upon unlawful arrangements.
Congress has forbidden monopolies and combinations.
When one exists everything done in furtherance of its
purpose is unlawful; especially every act constituting a
part of interstate or foreign commerce. Therefore the
privilege of engaging therein may be denied. The power
to regulate extends to prohibition of anything directly
conflicting with the will of Congress lawfully expressed.

Champion v. Ames (Lottery Case), 188 U. S. 321; United

The statute requires the court "to prevent and restrain
violations "-not merely to determine the legality of past
transactions. The public interest is the thing to be subserved, and it demands the destruction of existing mischief
and prevention of impending wrongs-the removal of
obstruction existing or threatened.
Where an unlawful corporate combination exists and
identity of constituents has been destroyed, or where one
corporation has acquired a forbidden monopoly, there are
two possible effective remedies. The first is to enjoin the
corporation from doing interstate or foreign business until
(if ever) it can affirmatively show that its affairs have been
readjusted so as to render future operations lawful. The
second is to appoint a receiver to take possession of the
concern and by proper action restore opportunities for
free competition. Deb's Case, 158 U. S. 564; Chicago,

The Government established violations of the Sherman
Act by proving first, the existence of contracts, combinations, conspiracies and monopolies; and, second, that the
direct result or necessary tendency of these is materially
.to obstruct, hinder and burden the free flow of interstate
and foreign commerce.
The Knight Case is not controlling; the combinations
established here directly and materially affect not onlythe production and manufacture, but every department of
trade and commerce in tobacco; and the results have been
destruction of competition in such commerce and the creation of monopolies by defendants.
The purposes of anti-trust legislation cannot 'be frustrated by operating through a corporation, nor by means
of executed sales and transfers of property. The Northern
Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197; Harrimanv.
Northern Securities Co., 197 U. S. 244, seem decisive on
this point.
Moreover, if important, the evidence clearly establishes
that the defendants' actions have been characterized by
duress, and unfair and oppressive methods; and that following a fixed plan they have sought to suppress competition and secure monopolies.
The decree below was right in so far as it enjoined acts
in furtherance of the combination; enjoined the control of
certain defendant corporations by others through stock
ownership; and also in so far as it prohibited the American
Tobacco Company and other defendants adjudged to be
in and of themselves combinations in restraint of trade
from engaging in interstate or foreign commerce.
The decree below did no more than was necessary to
destroy the unlawful combinations and prevent violations

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 123

of the act-in fact it did not go far enough. Prohibition of
acts in furtherance of the combination and also of control
by one corporation of another is abundantly supported by
The Northern Securities "Co. v. United States; Swift &
Co. v. United States, and United States v. D. & H. R. R.
That part of the decree which adjudges the American
Tobacco Company and others unlawful combinations and
enjoins them from engaging in commerce is novel-apparently without a direct precedent; but it harmonizes
with the duty to enforce the act. Swift & Co. v. United
States, supra.
The petition should not have been dismissed as to the
individual defendants.
In order effectually to destroy combinations the intelligent manipulators of corporate agencies must be reached.
Observance and every act done in pursuance of the
English contracts within the United States are unlawful;
and the petition was wrongfully dismissed as to the Imperial Tobacco Company, British-American Tobacco Company and domestic corporations controlled by the latter.
The effect of the agreements entered into in England
between the American combination and the Imperial
Tobacco Company was to suppress competition between
those two great concerns both within and without the
United States. The British-American Tobacco Company
was brought into existence as the instrumentality for
making the agreements effective. The result of the whole
arrangement was to destroy competition, and inevitably
tends to monopoly. Observance of these arrangements
should have been prohibited. The British-American Tobacco Company should have been enjoined from doing
business within the United States; and the same prohibition should have been applied to the Imperial Tobacco Company during the continuation of the unlawful
contracts.
The petition should not have been dismissed as to the

United Cigar Stores Company. This concern is one of
the instrumentalities in the hands of the American Tobacco Company for carrying out its unlawful purposes, and
the connection between them should have been severed.
The final decree should have adjudged that defendants
were attempting to monopolize, and had monopolized,
a part of interstate and foreign commerce.
Monopoly is a practical conception, and its existence
must be determined in view of business conditions. The
evidence abundantly establishes that the defendants have
acquired power to control prices and smother competition.
The final decree should have enjoined corporations
holding shares of others from collecting dividends thereon.
This relief was granted in the Northern Securities Case,
and is an appropriate way to destroy the relationship
where one corporation improperly controls another by
stock ownership.

The transactions principally complained of by the Government in this bill involve the validity of one or the other
of the two following transactions, to-wit: (a) Consolidation
of manufacturing interests through the formation of the
corporation and the transfer to it of the properties in such
manufacturing industries for exchange of stock of the
vendee corporation or for cash; (b) purchase by a corporation engaged in manufacturing of the property of
a competitor, or through the purchase by such corporation
of whole or part of the stock of the corporation of such

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 125

competing corporation, generally for cash. These transactions are not within the operation of the Sherman Law,
because they primarily affect manufacturing and not commerce. Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568; County of Mobile v.
Kimball, 102 U. S. 691; Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517; Turpin

re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104; United States v. Knight, 156
U. S. 1.
The Knight Case was not a sporadic decision of this
court, but was the logical outcome of the cases that preceded it that have just been cited, and it has not been
overruled or modified by any subsequent decision, but
has been expressly recognized wherever mentioned. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U. S. 211;
Montague v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38; Swift & Co. v. United
States, 196 U. S. 375; Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson,

Mobile County, 209 U. S. 405; Bigelow v. Calumet Co., 167
Fed. Rep. 721. Confusion has arisen and it has been assumed that the Knight Case has been overruled or modified
because of the failure to distinguish between the persons
complained of and the transaction which is the basis of
the complaint. The defendants in this case and the defendants in the Knight Case were engaged in interstate
commerce, but the question is not whether the defendant
is engaged or not in interstate commerce, but whether the
transaction complained of is an act of, or direct in its effect on, interstate commerce; one engaging in interstate
commerce does not thereby subject himself and his whole
business to the control of Congress. Howard v. Railroad
Company, 207 U. S. 463, 502.
Any attempt to distinguish this case from the Knight
Case based upon unskillful pleading on the part of the
Government in the Knight Case, is defeated by a consider-

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

ation of the record of that case on file in this court. The
scope of the Knight Case as here contended has been assumed by the law department of the Government from
1895 to 1907. Annual Reports of the Attorney General
1895, p. 13; for 1896, p. xxvii; for 1899, pp. 21 et seq.; for
1906, p. 7; Senate Document No. 687, 2d Session, 60th
Congress, p. 27. Upon the decision in the Knight Case,
the defendants-and these defendants are only one among
many in this respect-have proceeded; this adjudication
of this court has become a rule of property, and to overrule it would make wrecks of these enterprises; a case of
such close analogy to ex post facto laws is presented that the
maxim of stare decisis becomes almost as if embodied in
the Constitution itself. It is as important that the law
should be settled permanently as that it should be settled
correctly. Gilbert v. Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713, 724; Vale
v. Arizona, 207 U. S. 201, 205.
Without reference to whether the trade is interstate, the
transactions shown by this record do not constitute contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade,
and are not against the public policy which this court has
(NorthernSecurities Case, supra)declared to be the purpose
and effect of the Sherman Law. The intent of Congress
was not to unsettle legitimate business enterprises, but
rather to place a statutory prohibition, with prescribed
penalties and remedies, upon those contracts which were
in direct restraint of trade, unreasonable, and against
public policy. (Mr. Justice Brewer in Northern Securities
Case). The transfer of property by purchase, sale, or consolidation, whether by the formation of partnerships, organization of corporations, or consolidation of preexisting
corporations, is not violative of the common law. See
Fairbanks v. Leary, 40 Wisconsin, 637; People v. North
River Sugar Refining Co., 121 N. Y. 583; Trenton Potteries
Co. v. Oliphant, 58 N. J. Eq. 507; Cameron v. Water Co.

210 Pa. St. 288, 300. Such transfer and consolidation is
not opposed to the public policy, but is expressly authorized
and facilitated by the merger statutes of many States,
and is forbidden by the statutes of none. Many of the
States which authorize the merger of corporations have
anti-trust statutes of the same general import as the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, and to give to the Federal AntiTrust statute the meaning contended for by the Government and to import that meaning into the various state
anti-trust statutes would work the incongruity of assuming that the States had facilitated the formation of corporations, which by their very formation would become
outlaws of commerce.
The decision of this court in Northern Securities Case is
not in conflict with the contention here made; this court in
the Northern Securities Case did not overrule or modify the
declarations theretofore made, and in subsequent decisions has not recognized the Northern Securities Case as in
conflict with the contention here made. Trans-Missouri

were entirely distinct from those combinations of capital
and ability which had long existed in the form of jointstock associations or corporations or partnerships, and it
is the duty of the court to apply the Sherman Law as an
evolutionary statute, and not assume a revolutionary
purpose in the mind of Congress in its enactment.
These defendants have not violated the Sherman Law
by monopolizing trade or commerce, although they in the
aggregate enjoy large, but varying, proportions of the
business in the products of tobacco. Monopolizing under
the Sherman Law is an activity and not a state of being,
and size, and the power that is inherent in size, whether
size be considered in relation to investment or to the proportion of business at the time enjoyed, is not monopolizing or an element of monopolizing. Monopoly at common
law was a license or privilege for the sole buying and selling, making, working, or using of anything whatsoever,
whereby the subject in general is restrained from that
liberty in manufacturing or trading which he had before.
4 Blackstone, 159. Monopolizing under the statute carries
with it the idea of exclusion, and whatever the magnitude
of a concern may be, it is not guilty of monopolizing or attempting to monopolize unless it is doing something by
which there is either attained or attempted this result, towit, that "the subject in general is restrained from that
liberty of trading which he had before." See dissenting
opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Northern Securities Case,

Argument for the American Tobacco Co.

These defendants have not, either singly or in combination, excluded or attempted to exclude anyone from trade
and commerce. (a) They have not cornered nor attempted
to corner the supply of raw material; it is a matter of serious doubt whether such corner or attempting to corner
would fall within the inhibition of the Sherman Law, or
within the constitutional power of Congress, as being an
act of, or direct in its effect on, interstate commerce, even
if the record disclosed it. But decisions as to those questions are not necessary to an adjudication of this case.
(b) Defendants have not enjoyed rebates or other preference in transportation; (c) they have not enjoyed exclusive advantage in the use of machinery and facilities
for manufacturing; (d) they have not excluded nor attempted to exclude competitors from the avenues of distribution-marketing their products. It is impossible to
conceive of exclusion or attempt to exclude competitors
from trade that does not involve one or the other of the
foregoing methods or avenues. The defendants have met
active competition, and in meeting it have adopted the
ordinary methods of competition. To give a construction
to the Sherman Law, intended as it is to foster competition,
that would forbid the usual methods of competition, would
make the statute self-destructive. Competition, it is often
said, is the life of trade, but the object of all competition
is to drive out other competitors. To say that a man is
to trade freely, but that he is to stop short of any act which
is calculated to harm other tradesmen and which is designed to attract business to his own shop would be a
strange and impossible counsel of perfection. The rights
of competitors are different from the rights of strangers
to the trade, and conduct is justified on the part of the
person or corporation who seeks to build his own business
that would be unlawful if adopted by him whose only
motive was the injury of another. Loewe v. Lawlor, supra;

Purchasers of competing businesses do not constitute
attempts to monopolize, for such purchases do not exclude others from the trade, but leave the field open; this is
true, although the inducement to purchase is to get rid of a
competitor. The law of self-defense and protection applies to one's business as well as to his person. United

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 131
221 U. S.

Argument for the American Tobacco Co.

The Sherman Law properly construed and applied is a
beneficent and evolutionary statute, whose purpose and
effect is to preserve to every one liberty and opportunity
to engage in interstate commerce-it preserves this liberty
and opportunity as against the unreasonable covenants
and contracts of the party himself, as well as against the
torfious conduct of others, whether those others seek in
combination to exclude a stranger to the combination, or
seek singly to exclude him. In other words, this statute
applies to interstate trade the doctrines of the common law
applicable to trade and commerce, without respect to
whether interstate or not, and the words used in it are
well known words at common law, which must, in the interpretation of this law, be given their common law meaning. The chief purpose of the statute was to make certain
the application in the Federal jurisdiction of the principles
of the common law, and to provide definite and certain
remedies for the enforcement thereof.
In addition to the considerations heretofore mentioned,
this construction, and this construction alone, gives meaning and effect to every word of the statute: (a) The first
section of the statute condemns every contract, etc., in
restraint of trade-the construction contended for by
the Government in this case would eliminate the word
"every" from the statute and makes the test dependent
not upon the nature of the act, but its magnitude or result;
these defendants contend that it is the nature of the act
that is the test and that every transaction of the prohibited
nature is forbidden, whatever its magnitude, result, or
intent; (b) the second section forbids the monopolizing
or attempt to monopolize of any part of interstate trade
or commerce-the Government's contention as to the
meaning of this second section eliminates these words
from the statute or substitutes for them the words "in
large part," or "a dominating part"; the construction contended for by these defendants gives full force to the mean-

Argument for the American Tobacco Co.

221 U. S.

ing "any part "-it is a violation of the statute to exclude
or attempt to exclude by tortious means a trader from
even the smallest part of interstate trade or commerce.
An additional argument in favor of the construction of
the statute here contended for is seen when the remedy is
considered. The court below, construing the statute as
contended for by the Government, said that it condemned
that incidental elimination of competition which comes
from ordinary consolidation, sale, and purchase; in order
to give vitality to such construction there are involved
two grave constitutional questions: First: Is there a constitutional power in Congress to forbid the ordinary transactions that have characterized all commercial peoples,
and that are unquestionably valid at common law? Second: Has Congress the constitutional power to prevent a
state corporation from engaging in interstate commerce
in wholesome products? These defendants believe that
these two questions should be each answered in the negative; Congress has no right under its authority to regulate
commerce, great and paramount as that power is, to
violate the fundamental rights secured by other provisions
of the Constitution. Monongahela Co. v. United States,
148 U. S. 312, 336; Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161,
180; Allgeyer Case, 165 U. S. 578, 589, 591. Congress has
not a right to forbid corporations or natural persons from
engaging in interstate commerce in wholesome productsthe right of intercourse between State and State derives
its source from those laws whose authority is acknowledged
by civilized man throughout the world-the Constitution
found it an existing right and gave to Congress only the
power to regulate it. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 211;
Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168. Corporations have this
right as certainly and as thoroughly as natural persons.

Case, 188 U. S. 321, is not in conflict with this contention,
because it was based on the inherent vicious nature of the
commodity involved, to-wit, lottery tickets.
It is well settled that if a statute be susceptible of two
interpretations, by one of which it would be unconstitutional or of doubtful constitutional validity, and by the
other valid, the latter construction should be adopted.
Commodities Case, 213 U. S. 366. The court below, however, having construed the Sherman Anti-Trust Law as
forbidding the elimination of competition that results incidentally from sale, purchase and consolidation, resolved
these two grave constitutional questions against the defendants, and, under the language of a statute which authorizes a court to restrain and enjoin only "violations of
the Act," restrained and enjoined the assumed violators
of the act from all interstate activity. It is practicable
for a court to "prevent and restrain" the making or the
continued operation of an executory contract or conspiracy, or combination in the nature of a contract or conspiracy; and it is practicable for a court to prevent and restrain a practice which involves monopolizing tradetortiously excluding or attempting to exclude strangers
to the scheme contemplated; these are the things condemned by the Sherman Law; it is not practicable nor
constitutional to prevent or restrain the purchaser of private property from the use of his property, or penalize
such use by preventing his engaging in interstate commerce in wholesome articles. The impracticability of constitutional remedy demonstrates the unsoundness of the
construction of the act contended for by the Government.

cause has to do with the alleged combinations entered
into by the American Tobacco Company and its allied
companies in this country, with which the Imperial Company and the British-American Company have no concern. It is claimed, however, by the Government that certain contracts entered into by the Imperial Company in
1902 with the American Company were in violation of the
Sherman Act, and that the transactions of the Imperial
Company since that date have been in violation of the act.
These contracts were entered into in England in the summer of 1902 for the purpose of putting an end to the
ruinous competition which was being carried on in England
by the Ogdens Limited owned by the American Company.
The court below was right in dismissing the bill as to
the Imperial Company and as to the British-American
Tobacco Company, on the ground that those companies
were British companies, that the contracts to which they
were parties were made in Great Britain and were valid
under the laws of Great Britain, and that the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act has no extraterritorial effect. American

The agreements of September 27, 1902, between the
American Tobacco Company and the Imperial Tobacco
Company were not in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act. So far as those agreements operated to restrain
trade in Great Britain or between Great Britain and countries other than the United States, they are not within
the prohibition of the Sherman Act. So far as they operate
to restrain trade between England and this country, or
between the various States of this country, such restraint
is merely incidental to the sale of certain plants and good
will, and is not within the prohibition of the Sherman Act.
The principle that there are certain contracts in partial
restraint of trade which would not be invalid at common
law, and which do not come within the prohibition of the
Sherman Act, has been recognized by this court in the

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 135
221 U. S.

Argument for the Imperial Tobacco Co.

very cases which are cited by the Government as holding
that all contracts in restraint of trade whether reasonable
or unreasonable, are in violation of the Sherman Act.
See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association.
166 U. S. 290, 329. The same principle is recognized in
United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U. S. 505,
566; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197,
per Mr. Justice Brewer at p. 361; Cincinnati Packet Co.
v. Bay, 200 U. S. 179, per Mr. Justice'Holmes at p. 184.
Mr. Justice Peckham in the Joint Traffic Case held that
the statute is to have a "reasonable construction." When
he states that contracts in restraint of trade are invalid
under the statute, whether reasonable or unreasonable, he
refers not to contracts between mercantile or manufacturing concerns, but to contracts or combinations between
competing railroad corporations, all of which contracts or
combinations are illegal under the statute even though the
rates and fares established are reasonable. See 171 U. S.
568, 570.
The distinction between contracts affecting public service corporations, and contracts between private individuals
or corporations, is well stated in Gibbs v. Baltimore Gas
Co., 130 U. S. 396, where it was held that a corporation
cannot disable itself by contract from the performance of
public duties which it has undertaken, and thereby make
public accommodation or convenience subservient to its
private interests, but where the public welfare is not involved, and where the restraint of one party is not greater
than protection to the other party requires, the contract
in restraint of trade may be sustained.
The validity of covenants between vendor and vendee,
for the purpose of protecting the covenantee in the enjoyment of the legitimate fruits of the contract, have
been upheld under the Sherman Act in the Addyston Pipe
Case, 85 Fed. Rep. 291, modified and affirmed without
approval of the opinion below in 175 U. S. 211; Brett v.

In view of the statement of Mr. Justice Brewer in his
concurring opinion in the Northern Securities. Case, 193
U. S. 361, that "Congress did not intend to reach and destroy those minor ontracts in partial restraint of trade,"
and in view of the limitations placed upon the effect of
the statute in Mr. Justice Peckham's opinion in the TransMissouri Case, we may fairly assume the statement made
by Mr. Justice Brewer to represent the views of this
court, especially as to contracts of a mercantile character
not affecting railroads or other direct instruments of
commerce. The subject of contracts not in restraint of
trade at common law prior to the act of 1890 is discussed
by this court in Oregon Steam Navigation Co. v. Winsor,
20 Wall. 64; Gibbs v. Consolidated Gas Co., 130 U. S. 396,
409; Fowles v. Park, 131 U. S. 88-96.
The lower Federal courts have decided numerous cases
both before and since the Sherman Act, upholding contracts, the avowed object of which was to buy off competition of a business rival. Carterv. Alling, 43 Fed. Rep. 208;
U. S. Chemical Co. v. Provident Chemical Co., 64 Fed.
Rep. 946; Harrisonv. Glucose Sugar Refining Co., 116 Fed.
Rep. 304; National Enameling & Stamping Co. v. Haberman, 120 Fed. Rep. 415; Prainev. Ferrell, 166 Fed. Rep.
702; Walker v. Lawrence, 177 Fed. Rep. 363.
Contracts between parties which have for their object
the removal of a rival competitor in a business are not
to be regarded as contracts in restraint of trade. Contracts although in partial restraint of trade, if valid at
common law, and if not a cover for a combination or conspiracy to raise prices, or to prevent general competition,
are not invalid under the Sherman Act. This proposition

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 137
221 U. S.

Argument for the Imperial Tobacco Co.

is clearly held by the authorities above cited from the
Federal reports.
As to what contracts would not be illegal at common
law as in restraint of trade, see Rousillon v. Rousillon, 14
Ch. Div. 351; Leather Cloth Co. v. Lorsent, L. R. 9 Eq. 345;
approved by this court in Gibbs v. Consolidated Gas Co.,
130 U. S. 396.
In Nordenfelt v. Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co., L. R. 1894, App. Cases, 535, the House of Lords
reviewed at great length and in elaborate opinions the
whole subject of covenants in restraint of trade, and held
unanimously that a covenant, though unrestricted as to
space, was not invalid where it was shown to be no wider
than was necessary for the protection of the company,
nor injurious to the public interests.
The case of Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 N. Y. 473,
establishes the proposition that in connection with the
sale of a factory and the good will thereof, a covenant,
practically unrestricted in time or space, not to engage in
the manufacture or sale of competing articles, is not a
covenant in restraint of trade. The same principle is laid
down in the cases of Hodge v. Sloane, 107 N. Y. 244; Leslie
v. Lorillard, 110 N. Y. 519; Tode v. Gross, 127 N. Y. 480;
Matthews v. Associated Press, 136 N. Y. 333; Oakes v.
Cataragus Water Co., 143 N. Y. 430; Wood v. Whitehead
Brothers Co., 165 N. Y. 545; New York Bank Note Co. v.
Hamilton Bank Note Co., 180 N. Y. 280; Anchor Electric
Co. v. Hawkes, 171 Massachusetts, 101; United Shoe
Machinery Co. v. Kimball, 193 Massachusetts, 351; Rakestraw v. Lanier, 104 Georgia, 188; Bullock v. Johnson, 110
Georgia, 486.
The most recent decisions in the state courts in which
covenants to refrain from competition have been held
reasonable and lawful, are, Freudenthalv. Espey (Cal.), 102

As to the British-American agreement there is absolutely
nothing in that agreement which prevents, or tends to
prevent, any other company or companies from manufacturing and exporting tobacco to other countries than Great
Britain and the United States. There is no agreement to
restrict prices or to interfere in any way with free competition. .The evidence shows that there has been no
actual diminution in the business of exporting either leaf
tobacco or manufactured tobacco from the United States
to foreign countries by reason of the British-American
agreement.
None of the decisions heretofore made by this court under the Sherman Act are applicable to the agreements here
involved. The Joint Traffic, Trans-Missouriand Northern
Securities cases dealt with agreements between railroad
companies or holders of railroad stocks, the effect and intent of which were held to restrict competition between
common carriers and public service corporations. They
have no application to agreements between manufacturers,
but are based upon the peculiar obligations of common
carriers and public service corporations. The Addyston
Pipe Case, 175 U. S. 211, involved an agreement between
rival and competing manufacturers that there should be
no competition between them in certain States or Territories, the direct, immediate and intended effect of which
agreement was the enhancement of the price.
Montague v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38, was an agreement, the
effect of which was to raise prices in the California market.

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 139
221 U. S.

Argument for the Imperial Tobacco Co.

The case of Swift & Co. v. United States involved a combination of independent meat dealers who agreed not to
bid against each other in the livestock markets, to fix
selling prices and to restrict shipments of meat when necessary.
The case of Chattanooga Foundry v. Atlanta, 203 U. S.
390, was a sequel of the Addyston Pipe Case.
The case of Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, 209 U. S.
423, was a case where the lessor company had agreed with
the lessee company not only to go out of the field of competition, and not to enter that field again, but had further
agreed to render every assistance to prevent others from
entering it.
The case of Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Voight Sons,
212 U. S. 227, was a case of an agreement between a number of manufacturers who organized a selling company
through which their entire output was sold to such persons
only as would enter into a purchasing agreement by which
their sales were restricted. The agreement provided for
selling by jobbers at particular specified prices. The company was a selling company organized to control all the
selling business of the manufacturing wall paper corporations, partnerships and persons who owned the stock of
the Continental Wall Paper Company, and made separate
contracts with that corporation giving it entire control of
the selling business of the manufacturers.
None of the cases in this court apply to the agreements
between the American and Imperial Companies, which
are involved in this suit. They had no necessary effect to
directly and substantially restrict free competition in any
of the products of tobacco, and did not unlawfully restrain
interstate commerce. Whitwell v. Continental Tobacco
Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 461.
The oral testimony shows that the agreements did not
and could not, under the existing circumstances, operate
to restrain trade or create a monopoly, and therefore could

Argument for the Imperial Tobacco Co.

221 U. S.

not, and did not operate as a violation of the Sherman
Anti-trust Act. It appears from the testimony that at
the time of the agreements, there was practically no exportation or importation of manufactured products between Great Britain and the United States, owing to the
protective duties in this country and the differentials imposed upon imported goods in Great Britain. It was not
possible to sell manufactured tobacco imported into this
country in competition with the domestic articles of manufacture, nor was it possible to export to England and sell
in competition with domestic manufacture.
So far as the bill of complaint herein avers, that there
was any restraint of competition in the purchase of leaf
tobacco, the evidence overwhelmingly disproves any such
claim. There was no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the American Tobacco Company and
the Imperial or its representatives, to refrain from active
competition in the purchase of leaf tobacco. The testimony shows without any contradiction that there has
been at all times active competition between the Imperial
Company's agents and the agents of the American Company, and of the independent concerns, and of the "Rigi"
countries in the purchase of leaf tobacco, and the testimony shows that the price of leaf tobacco has increased
since the agreements between the Imperial and American
Company were made, and is still increasing. The amount
of the consumption of leaf tobacco and the prices paid for
it have both increased since 1902 up to the present time.
No decree can be made in this suit as against the Imperial Company which will be just and equitable.
There are three possible evils aimed at by the Sherman
Anti-trust Act. First, the raising of the price of the commodity to consumers; second; the lowering of the price of
raw material to producers; third, the crushing out of
competitors. There is no evidence in the case at bar that
the agreements between the Imperial Company and the

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 141
221 U. S.

Argument for the United Cigar Stores Co.

American Company which are attacked in this suit, have
resulted in any one of these three evils.
There is no evidence that the price of tobacco products
in any of their forms, has been raised to the consumer. So
far as appears, the price has remained the same.
There is no evidence that the price to the producers of
leaf tobacco has been reduced. On the contrary, the evidence is uncontradicted that the price has steadily increased.
There is no evidence that any competitor has been in
any way interfered with by reason of the agreements between the Imperial Company and the American Company.
Every manufacturer in the United States has been at
liberty to manufacture and export his goods without
hindrance on the part of either the Imperial or the American Company, or the British-American or any of the other
defendants in this case. The agreements in this suit do
not undertake to fix prices or to pool profits, or to eliminate
competition in any way, or to interfere with the ordinary
laws of supply and demand.
Mr. Sol M. Stroock for the United Cigar Stores Company:
The company has not violated any of the provisions
of § 1 of the Sherman Anti-trust Act. It has not made
any contract, nor engaged in any combination or conspiracy restraining the interstate commerce of the other
defendants or any of them; or restraining its own interstate commerce; or restraining the interstate commerce
of any competitor of the other defendants, or any of
them; or restraining the interstate commerce of any
competitor with it.
The United Cigar Stores Company has not violated
any of the provisions of § 2 of the Sherman Anti-trust
Act. It has not secured nor attempted to secure a monopoly for any of the other defendants nor combined

with any of the other defendants to exclude others from
the field of competition with them.
It has not secured nor attempted to secure a monopoly
of the retail trade for itself, nor attempted, either alone or
in combination or conspiracy with the other defendants,
to exclude others from the field of competition with it.
The United Cigar Stores Company has not, as an incident of obtaining a monopoly, or as part of any combination in restraint of trade, prevented vendors from engaging in the business of handling and dealing in tobacco
products.

corporations, most of them created in the State of New
Jersey, and two English corporations. For convenience
of statement we classify the corporate defendants, exclusive of the two foreign ones, which we shall hereafter
separately refer to, as follows: The American Tobacco
Company, a New Jersey corporation, because of its dominant relation to the subject-matter of the controversy as
the primary defendant; five other New Jersey corporations
(viz., American Snuff Company, American Cigar Company, American Stogie Company, MacAndrews & Forbes
Company, and Conley Foil Company), because of their
relation to the controversy as the accessory, and the fiftynine other American corporations as the subsidiary defendants.
The ground of complaint against the American Tobacco
Company rested not alone upon the nature and character
of that corporation and the power which it exerted directly over the five accessory corporations and some of the
subsidiary corporations by stock ownership in such corporations, but also upon the control which it exercised
over the subsidiary companies by virtue of stock held in
said companies by the accessory companies by stock ownership in which the American Tobacco Company exerted
its power of control. The accessory companies were impleaded either because of their nature and character or
because of the power exerted over them through stock
ownership by the American Tobacco Company and also
because of the power which they in turn exerted by stock
ownership over the subsidiary corporations, and finally
the subsidiary corporations were impleaded either because
of their nature or because of the control to which they were
subjected in and by virtue of the stock ownership above
stated. We append in the margin a statement showing
H. M. Hanna, Herbert D. Kingsbury, Pierre Lorillard, Rufus L. Patterson, Frank H. Ray, Grant B. Schley, Charles N. Strotz, Peter A. B.

moment to say that the bill averred the origin and nature
of the American Tobacco Company and the origin and
nature of all the other defendant corporations, whether
accessory or subsidiary, and the connection of the individual defendants with such corporations. In effect the
bill charged that the individual defendants and the defendant corporations were engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of interstate and foreign trade in tobacco and
the products of tobacco and constituted a combination
in restraint of such trade in violation of the first section
of the act, and also were attempting to monopolize and
were actually a monopolization of such trade in violation
of the second section. In support of these charges general
averments were made in the bill as to the wrongful purpose and intent with which acts were committed which it
was alleged brought about the alleged wrongful result.

As to the answers, it suffices to say that all the individual

and corporate defendants other than the foreign corporations denied the charges of wrongdoing and illegal combination and the corporate defendants in particular in
addition averred their right under state charters by virtue
of which they existed to own and possess the property
which they held and further averred that they were engaged in manufacturing and that any combination amongst
them related only to that subject, and therefore was not
within the Anti-trust Act. The two foreign corporations
asserted the validity of their corporate organization and
of the assailed agreements, and denied any participation
in the alleged wrongful combination.
After the taking of much testimony before a special
examiner, the case was heard before a court consisting of
four judges, constituted under the expediting act of February 11, 1903. In deciding the case in favor of the Government each of the four judges delivered an opinion
(164 Fed. Rep. 700). A final decree was entered on December 15, 1908. The petition was dismissed as to the
English corporations, three of the subsidiary corporations,
the United Cigar Stores Company and all the individual
defendants. It was decreed that the defendants other
than those against whom the petition was dismissed, had
theretofore entered into and were parties to combinations
in restraint of trade, etc., in violation of the Anti-trust
Act and said defendants and each of them, their officers,
agents, etc., were restrained and enjoined "from directly
or indirectly doing any act or thing whatsoever in furtherance of the objects and purposes of said combinations and
from continuing as parties thereto." It specifically found
that each of the defendants, "The American Tobacco
Company, American Snuff Company, American Cigar
Company, American Stogie Company, and MacAndrews
& Forbes Company constitutes and is itself a combination
in violation of the said Act of Congress." The corporations thus named, their officers, etc., were next restrained

and enjoined "from further directly or indirectly engaging
in interstate or foreign trade and commerce in leaf tobacco
or the products manufactured therefrom or articles necessary or useful in connection therewith. But if any of said
last-named defendants can hereafter affirmatively show
the restoration of reasonably competitive conditions, such
defendant may apply to this court for a modification, suspension or dissolution of the injunction herein granted
against it." The decree then enumerated the various
corporations which it was found held or claimed to own
some or all of the capital stock of other corporations and
particuiarly specified such other corporations, and then
made the following restraining provisions:
"Wherefore each and all of defendants, The American
Tobacco Company, the American Snuff Company, the
American Cigar Company, P. Lorillard Company, R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company, Blackwell's Durham Tobacco Company and Conley Foil Company, their officers,
directors, agents, servants and employ6s are hereby restrained and enjoined from acquiring by conveyance or
otherwise, the plant or business of any such corporation
wherein any one of them now holds or owns stock; and
each and all of said defendant corporations so holding
stock in other corporations as above specified, their officers,
directors, agents, servants and employ&s, are further enjoined from voting or attempting to vote said stock at any
meeting of the stockholders of the corporation issuing the
same and from exercising or attempting to exercise any
control, direction, supervision or influence whatsoever over
the acts and doings of such corporation. And it is further
ordered and decreed that each and every of the defendant
corporations the stock of which is held by any other defendant corporation as hereinbefore shown, their officers,
directors, servants and agents, be and they are hereby respectively and collectively restrained and enjoined from
permitting the stock so held to be voted by any other de-

Opinion of the Court.

fendant holding or claiming to own the same or by its attorneys or agents at any corporate election for directors or
officers and from permitting or suffering any other defendant corporation claiming to own or hold stock therein, or
its officers or agents, to exercise any control whatsoever
over its corporate acts."
Judgment for costs was given in favor of the petitioner
and against the defendants as to whom the petition had
not been dismissed, except the R. P. Richardson, Jr.,
& Company, a corporation which had consented to the
decree. The decree also contained a provision that the
defendants or any of them should not be prevented "from
the institution, prosecution or defense of any suit, action
or proceeding to prevent or restrain the infringement of a
trade-mark used in interstate commerce or otherwise assert
or defend a claim to any property or rights." In the event
of a taking of an appeal to this court, the decree provided
that the injunction which it directed "shall be suspended
during the pendency of such appeal."
The United States appealed, as did also the various defendants against whom the decree was entered. For the
Government it is contended: 1. That the petition should
not have been dismissed as to the individual defendants.
2. That it should not have been dismissed as to the two
foreign corporations-the Imperial Tobacco Company
and the British-American Tobacco Company and the
domestic corporations controlled by the latter, and that,
on the contrary, the decree should have commanded the
observance of the Anti-trust Act by the foreign corporations so far as their dealings in the United States were concerned, and should have restrained those companies from
doing any act in the United States in violation of the Antitrust Act, whether or not the right to do said acts was asserted to have arisen pursuant to the contracts made outside of or within the United States. 3. The petition should
not have been dismissed as to 'the United Cigar Stores

221 U. S.

Company. 4. The final decree should have adjudged defendants parties to unlawful contracts and conspiracies.
5. The final decree should have adjudged that defendants
were attempting to monopolize and had monopolized parts
of commerce. More particularly, it is urged, it should
have adjudged that the American Tobacco Company,
American Snuff Company, American Cigar Company,
American Stogie Company, MacAndrews & Forbes Company, the Conley Foil Company and the British-American
Tobacco Company Were severally attempting to monopolize and had monopolized parts of commerce, and that
appropriate remedies should have been applied. 6. The
decree was not sufficiently specific, since it should have
described with more particularity the methods which the
defendants had followed in forming and carrying out their
unlawful purpose, and should have prohibited the resort
to similar methods. 7. The decree should have specified
the shares in corporations disclosed by the evidence to be
owned by the parties to the conspiracy, and should have
enjoined those parties from exercising any control over the
corporations in which such stock was held, and the latter,
if made defendant, from permitting such control, and
should have also enjoined the collecting of any dividends
upon the stock. 8. The decree improperly provided that
nothing therein should prevent defendants from prosecuting or defending suits; also improperly suspended the
injunction pending appeal.
The defendants, by their assignments of error, complain
because the petition was not dismissed as to all, and more
specifically, (a) because they were adjudged parties to a
combination in restraint of interstate and foreign commerce, and enjoined accordingly; (b) because certain defendant corporations holding shares in others were enjoined from voting them or exercising control over the
issuing company, and the latter from permitting this; and
(c) because the American Tobacco Company, American

Opinion of the Court.

Snuff Company, American .Cigar Company, American
Stogie Company and the MacAndrews & Forbes Company were adjudged unlawful combinations and restrained
from engaging in interstate and foreign commerce.
The elaborate arguments made by both sides at bar present in many forms of statement the conflicting contentions resulting from the nature and character of the
suit and the defense thereto, the decree of the lower court
and the propositions assigned as error to which we have
just referred. In so far as all or any of these contentions,
as many of them in fact do, involve a conflict as to the
application and effect of §§ 1 and 2 of the Anti-trust
Act, their consideration has been greatly simplified by
the analysis and review of that act and the construction affixed to the sections in question in the case of StandardOil
Company v. United States, quite recently decided, ante,
p. 1. In so far as the contentions relate to the disputed
propositions of fact, we think from the view which we take
of the case they need not be referred to, since in our opinion
the case can be disposed of by considering only those facts
which are indisputable and by applying to the inferences
properly deducible from such facts the meaning and effect
of the law as expounded in accordance with the previous
decisions of this court.
We shall divide our investigation of the case into three
subjects: First, the undisputed facts; second, the meaning
of the Anti-trust Act and its application as correctly construed to the ultimate conclusions of fact deducible from
the proof; third, the remedies to be applied.
First. Undisputedfacts.
The matters to be considered under this heading we
think can best be made clear by stating the merest outline of the condition of the tobacco industry prior to what
is asserted to have been the initial movement in the combination which the suit assails and in the light so afforded
to .briefly recite the history of the assailed acts and con-

tracts. We shall divide the subject into two periods,
(a) the one from the time of the organization of the first
or old American Tobacco Company in 1890 to the organization of the Continental Tobacco Company, and (b) from
the date of such organization to the filing of the bill in this
case.
Summarizing in the broadest way the conditions which
obtained prior to 1890, as to the production, manufacture
and distribution of tobacco, the following general facts
are adequate to portray the situation.
Tobacco was grown in many sections of the country
having diversity of soil and climate and therefore was
subject to various vicissitudes resulting from the places
of production and consequently varied in quality. The
great diversity of use to which tobacco was applied in
manufacturing caused it to be that there was a demand
for all the various qualities. The demand for all qualities
was not local, but widespread, extending as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and, therefore, all the products were
marketed under competitive conditions of a peculiarly
advantageous nature. The manufacture of the product
in this country in various forms was successfully carried
on by many individuals or concerns scattered throughout
the country, a larger number perhaps of the manufacturers
being in the vicinage of production and others being advantageously situated in or near the principal markets
of distribution.
Before January, 1890, five distinct concerns-Allen &
Ginter, with factory at Richmond, Va.; W. Duke, Sons &
Co., with factories at Durham, North Carolina, and New
York City; Kinney Tobacco Company, with factory at
New York City; W. S. Kimball & Company, with factory
at Rochester, New York; Goodwin & Company, with
factory at Brooklyn, New York-manufactured, distributed and sold in the United States and abroad 95 per
cent of all the domestic cigarette and less than 8 per cent

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 157
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of the smoking tobacco produced in the United States.
There is no doubt that these factories were competitors
in the purchase of the raw product which they manufactured and in the distribution and sale of the manufactured products. Indeed it is shown that prior to 1890
not only had normal and ordinary competition existed
between the factories in question, but that the competition
had been fierce and abnormal. In January, 1890, having
agreed upon a capital stock of $25,000,000, all to be divided
amongst them, and who should be directors, the concerns
referred to organized the American Tobacco Company in
New Jersey, "for trading and manufacturing," with broad
powers, and conveyed to it the assets and businesses, including good will and right to use the names of the old
concerns; and thereafter this corporation carried on the
business of all. The $25,000,000 of stock of the Tobacco
Company was allotted to the charter members as follows:
Allen & Ginter, $3,000,000 preferred, $4,500,000 common;
W. Duke, Sons & Co., $3,000,000 preferred, $4,500,000
common; Kinney Tobacco Company, $2,000,000 preferred,
$3,000,000 common; W. S. Kimball & Co., $1,000,000 preferred, $1,500,000 common; and Goodwin & Co., $1,000,000
preferred, $1,500,000 common.
There is a charge that the valuation at which the respective properties were capitalized in the new corporation
was enormously in excess of their actual value. We, however, put that subject aside, since we propose only to deal
with facts which are not in controversy.
Shortly after the formation of the new corporation the
Goodwin & Co. factory was closed, and the directors ordered "that the manufacture of all tobacco cigarettes be
concentrated at Richmond." The new corporation in
1890, the first year of its operation, manufactured about
two and one half billion cigarettes, that is, about 96 or
97 per cent of the total domestic output, and about five
and one-half million pounds of smoking tobacco out

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

of a total domestic product of nearly seventy million
pounds.
In a little over a year after the organization of the company it increased its capital stock by ten million dollars.
The purpose of this increase is inferable from the considerations which we now state.
There was a firm known as Pfingst, Doerhoefer & Co.,
consisting of a number of partners, who had been long and
successfully carrying on the business of manufacturing
plug tobacco in Louisville, Kentucky, and distributing it
through the channels of interstate commerce. In January,
1891, this firm was converted into a corporation known as
the National Tobacco Works, having a capital stock of
$400,000 all of which was issued to the partners. Almost
immediately thereafter, in the month of February, the
American Tobacco Company became the purchaser of all
the capital stock of the new corporation, paying $600,000
cash and $1,200,000 in stock of the American Tobacco
Company. The members of the previously existing firm
bound themselves by contract with the American Tobacco
Company to enter its service and manage the business
and property sold, and each further agreed that for ten
years he would not engage in carrying on, directly or indirectly, or permit or suffer the use of his name in connection
with the carrying on of the tobacco business in any form.
In April following, the American Tobacco Company
bought out the business of Philip Whitlock, of Richmond,
Virginia, who was engaged in the manufacture of cheroots
and cigars, and with the exclusive right to use the name of
Whitlock. The consideration for this purchase was
$300,000, and Whitlock agreed to become an employ6
of the American Tobacco Company for a number of years
and not to engage for twenty years in the tobacco business.
In the month of April the American Tobacco Company
also acquired the business of Marburg Brothers, a wellknown firm located at Baltimore, Maryland, and engaged

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 159
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

in the manufacture and distribution of tobacco, principally smoking and snuff. The consideration was a cash
payment of $164,637.65 and stock to the amount of
$3,075,000. The members of the firm also conveyed the
right to the use of the firm name and agreed not to engage
in the tobacco business for a lengthy period.
Again, in the same month, the American Tobacco
Company bought out a tobacco firm of old standing, also
located in Baltimore, known as G. W. Gail & Ax, engaged
principally in manufacturing and selling smoking tobacco,
buying with the business the exclusive right to use the
name of the firm or the partners, and the members of the
firm agreed not to engage in the tobacco business for a
specified period. The consideration for this purchase was
$77,582.66 in cash and stock to the amount of $1,760,000.
The plant was abandoned soon after.
The result of these purchases was manifested at once
in the product of the company for the year 1891, as will
appear from a note in the margin.' It will be seen that
as to cheroots, smoking tobacco, fine cut tobacco, snuff
and plug tobacco, the company had become a factor in all
branches of the tobacco industry.

respects typical of the occurrences which took place in all
the other years of the first period, that is during the years
1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898, we content
ourselves with saying that it is undisputed that between
February, 1891, and October, 1898, including the purchases which we have specifically referred to, the American
Tobacco Company acquired fifteen going tobacco concerns
doing business in the States of Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. For ten of the plants an all cash consideration of $6,410,235.26 was paid, while the payments
for the remaining five aggregated in cash $1,115,100.95
and in stock $4,123,000. It is worth noting that the last
purchase, in October, 1898, was of the Drummond Tobacco Company, a Missouri corporation dealing principally in plug, for which a cash consideration was paid
of $3,457,500.
The corporations which were combined for the purpose
of forming the American Tobacco Company produced
a very small portion of plug tobacco. That an increase
in this direction was contemplated is manifested by the
almost immediate increase of the stock and its use for the
purpose of acquiring, as we have indicated, in 1891 and
1892, the ownership and control of concerns manufacturing
plug tobacco and the consequent increase in that branch
of production. There is no dispute that as early as 1893
the president of the American Tobacco Company, by
authority of the corporation, approached leading manufacturers of plug tobacco and sought to bring about a
combination of the plug tobacco interests, and upon the
failure to accomplish this, ruinous competition, by lowering the price of plug below its cost, ensued. As a result of
this warfare, which continued until 1898, the American
Tobacco Company sustained severe losses aggregating
more than four millions of dollars. The warfare produced
its natural result, not only because the company acquired

221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

during the last two years of the campaign, as we have
stated, control of important plug tobacco concerns, but
others engaged in that industry came to terms. We say
this because in 1898, in connection with several leading
plug manufacturers, the American Tobacco Company organized a New Jersey corporation styled the Continental
Tobacco Company, for "trading and manufacturing,"
with a capital of $75,000,000, afterwards increased to
$100,000,000. The new company issued its stock and took
transfers to the plants, assets and businesses of five large
and successful competing plug manufacturers. 1
The American Tobacco Company also conveyed to
this corporation, at large valuations, the assets, brands,
real estate and good will pertaining to its plug tobacco
business, including the National Tobacco Works, the
James G. Butler Tobacco Co., Drummond Tobacco Company, and Brown Tobacco Co., receiving as consideration
$30,274,200 of stock (one-half common and one-half
preferred), $300,000 cash, and an additional sum for losses
sustained in the plug business during 1898, $840,035. Mr.
Duke, the president of the American Tobacco Company,
also became president of the Continental Company.

Company, that company acquired from the holders all the
$3,000,000 of the common stock of the P. Lorillard Company in exchange for $6,000,000 of its stock, and $1,581,300
of the $2,000,000 preferred in exchange for notes aggregating a sum considerably larger. The Lorillard Company,
however, although it thus passed practically under the
control of the American Tobacco Company by virtue of
its ownership of stock in the Continental Company, was
not liquidated, but its business continued to be conducted
as a distinct corporation, its goods being marked and put
upon the market just as if they were the manufacture of
an independent concern. •
Following the organization of the Continental Tobacco
Company the American Tobacco Company increased its
capital stock from thirty-five millions of dollars to seventy
millions of dollars, and declared a stock dividend of one
hundred per cent on its common stock, that is, a stock
dividend of $21,000,000.
As the facts just stated bring us to the end of the first
period which at the outset we stated it was our purpose
to review, it is well briefly to point out the increase in
the power and control of the American Tobacco Company and the extension of its activities to all forms of tobacco products which had been accomplished just prior
to the organization of the Continental Tobacco Company.
Nothing could show it more clearly than the following:
At the end of the time the company was manufacturing
eighty-six per cent or thereabouts of all the cigarettes
produced in the United States, above twenty-six per cent
of all the smoking tobacco, more than twenty-two per cent
of all plug tobacco, fifty-one per cent of all little cigars,
six per cent each of all snuff and fine cut tobacco, and over
two per cent of all cigars and cheroots.
A brief reference to the occurrences of the second period,
that is, from and after the organization of the Continental
Tobacco Company up to the time of the bringing of this

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 163
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

suit, will serve to make evident that the transactions in
their essence had all the characteristics of the occurrences
of the first period.
In the year 1899 and thereafter either the American or
the Continental company, for cash or stock, at an aggregate cost of fifty millions of dollars ($50,000,000), bought
and closed up some thirty competing corporations and
partnerships theretofore engaged in interstate and foreign
commerce as manufacturers, sellers, and distributors of tobacco and related commodities, the interested parties
covenanting not to engage in the business. Likewise the
two corporations acquired for cash, by issuing stock, and
otherwise, control of many competing corporations, now
going concerns, with plants in various States, Cuba and
Porto Rico, which manufactured, bought, sold and distributed tobacco products or related articles throughout
the United States and foreign countries, and took from the
parties in interest covenants not to engage in the tobacco
business.
The plants thus acquired were operated until the merger
in 1904, to which we shall hereafter refer, as a part of the
general system of the American and Continental companies. The power resulting from and the purpose contemplated in making these acquisitions by the companies
just referred to, however, may not be measured by considering alone the business of the company directly acquired, since some of those companies were made the
vehicles as representing the American or Continental company for acquiring and holding the stock of other and
competing companies, thus amplifying the power resulting from the acquisitions directly made by the American
or Continental company, without ostensibly doing so.
It is besides undisputed that in many instances the acquired corporations with the subsidiary companies over
which they had control through stock ownership were
carried on ostensibly as independent concerns disconnected

from either the American or the Continental company,
although they were controlled and owned by one or the
other of these companies. Without going into details on
these subjects, for the sake of brevity, we append in the
margin a statement of the corporations thus acquired,
with the mention of the competing concerns which such
corporations acquired.'
Tobacco Works (New York, N. Y.)-Capital $40,000cigarettes and smoking tobacco. In 1899 the American Tobacco Co.
acquired all the shares for $250,000, and- it is now a selling agency.
Luhrman & Wilbern Tobacco Company (Middletown, Ohio)Capital $900,000-scrap tobacco. This business was formerly carried
on by a partnership.
Mengel Box Company (Louisville, Ky.)-Capital $2,000,000boxes for packing tobacco. This company has acquired the stock
($150,000) of Columbia Box Company and of Tyler Box Company
($25,000), both at St. Louis.
The Porto Rican-American Tobacco Company (Porto Rico)-Capital $1,799,600. In 1899 the American Company caused the organization of the Porto Rican-American Tobacco Company, which took over
the partnership business of Rucabado y Portela-manufacturer of
cigars and cigarettes-with covenants not to compete. The American
Tobacco Company and American Cigar Company each hold $585,300
of the stock; the balance is in the hands of individuals.
Kentucky Tobacco Product Company (Louisville, Ky.)-Capital
$1,000,000. In 1899 the Continental Company acquired control of the
Louisville Spirit-Cured Tobacco Co., engaged in curing and treating
tobacco and utilizing the stems for fertilizers. By agreement, the
Kentucky Tobacco Product Company was organized in New Jersey,
with $1,000,000 capital, $450,000 issued to the old stockholders, and
$550,000 to Continental Company as consideration for agreement to
supply stems.
Golden Belt Manufacturing Company (North Carolina)-Capital,
$700,000-cotton bags and containers. In 1899 the American Tobacco
Company acquired the business of this corporation, which was formed
to take over a going business.
The Conley Foil Company (New York)-Tinfoil CombinationCapital, $825,000. In December, 1899, The American Tobacco Company secured control of the business of John Conley & Son (Partnership), New York, N. Y., manufacturers of tinfoil, an essential for pack1 Monopol

Opinion of the Court.

It is of the utmost importance to observe that the acquisitions made by the subsidiary corporations in some
cases likewise show the remarkable fact stated above, that
is, the disbursement of enormous amounts of money to
ing tobacco products. By agreement the Conley Foil Company was
incorporated in New Jersey "for trading and manufacturing," etc.,
with $250,000 capital (afterwards $375,000 and $825,000)-which took
over the firm's business and assets, etc., and The American Tobacco
Company became owner of the majority shares. The Conley Foil
Company has acquired all the stock of the Johnson Tinfoil & Metal
Company-a defendant-of St. Louis, a leading competitor, and they
supply under fixed contracts, the tinfoil used by defendants.
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (Winston-Salem, North Carolina). In 1899 the Continental Tobacco Company acquired control of
the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, one of the largest manufacturers of plug-output in 1898, 6,000,000 pounds. By agreement, a new
corporation (with same name) was organized in New Jersey and
capitalized at $5,000,000 (afterwards $7,525,000), which took over the
business and assets of the old one. The Continental Company immediately acquired the majority shares and The American Company now
holds $5,000,000 of stock. The separate organization has been preserved.
There was acquired in the name of the new Reynolds Company,
with covenants against competition, the following plants:
In 1900, T. L. Vaughn & Company, partnership, of Winston, N. C.;
consideration, $90,506; Brown Brothers Company, a North Carolina
corporation, Winston, N. C.; consideration, $67,615; and P. H. Hanes
& Company and B. F. Hanes & Company, Winston, N. C., partnership; consideration, $671,950.
In 1905, Rucker & Witten Tobacco Company, Martinsville, Va.;
consideration, $512,898.
In 1906, D. H. Spencer & Company, Martinsville, Va.; consideration, $314,255.
(All of the foregoing Ilants were closed as soon as purchased.)
A majority of the $400,000 capital stock in the Liipfert-Scales Company, of Winston, N. C., a corporation largely engaged in the manufacture of plug tobacco and interstate and foreign commerce in leaf
tobacco and its products, was acquired by the Reynolds Company.
The separate organization of the Liipfert-Scales Company is preserved
and the business carried on under its corporate name.
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company also holds $98,300 of stock of

acquire plants, which on being purchased were not utilized
but were immediately closed. It is also to be remarked,
that the facts stated in the memorandum in the margin
show on their face a singular identity between the conceptions which governed the transactions of this latter
period with those which evidently existed at the very
birth of the original organization of the American Tobacco
Company, as exemplified by the transactions in the first
period. A statement of particular transactions outside
of those previously referred to as having occurred during
the period in question will serve additionally to make the
situation clear. And to accomplish this purpose we shall,
as briefly as may be consistent with clarity, separately
refer to the facts concerning the organization during the
the MacAndrews & Forbes Company and $9,600 of the Amsterdam
Supply Company.
Blackwell's Durham Tobacco Company (Durham, N. C.)-Capital
$1,000,000. In 1899 The American Tobacco Company procured for
$4,000,000 all the stock of Blackwell's Durham Tobacco Company at
Durham, N. C., manufacturer and distributer of tobacco products.
Thereupon the Blackwell's Durham Tobacco Company, of New Jersey,
capital, $1,000,000, all owned by the American, was organized and took
over the assets of the old company, then under receivership. Its separate organization has been preserved.
The Durham Company has acquired control of the following competitors-Reynold's Tobacco Company; F. R. Penn Tobacco Company; and Wells-Whitehead Tobacco Company.
The following companies came also under the control of the American
Tobacco Company through acquired stock ownership.
S. Anargyros-capital $650,000-Turkish cigarettes. In 1890 The
American Tobacco Company procured the organization of corporation
of S. Anargyros, which took over that individual's going business and
has since controlled it. Through this company the business in Turkish
cigarettes is largely conducted.
The John Bollman Company (San Francisco)-Capital $200,000cigarettes. In 1900 The American Tobacco Company procured
organization of The John Bollman Company, which took over the
business of the former concern in exchange for stock. Its separate
organization has been preserved.

Opinion of the Court.

second period of the five corporations which were named
as defendants in the bill, as heretofore stated and which
for the purpose of designation we have hitherto classified
as accessory defendants, such corporations being the
American Snuff Company, American Cigar Company,
American Stogie Company, MacAndrews & Forbes Company (licorice), and Conley Foil Company.
(1). The American Snuff Company.
As we have seen, the American Tobacco Company at
the commencement of the first period produced a very
small quantity of snuff. Its capacity, however, in that
regard was augmented owing particularly to the formation
of the Continental Tobacco Company and the acquisition
of the Lorillard Company, by which it came to be a serious
factor as a snuff producer. There shortly ensued an
aggressive competition in the snuff business between the
American Tobacco Company, with the force acquired
from the vantage ground resulting from the dominancy
of its expanded organization, and others in the trade operating independently of that organization. The result was
identical with that which had previously arisen from like
conditions in the past.
In March, 1900, there was organized in New Jersey a
corporation known as The American Snuff Company, with
a capital of $25,000,000, one-half preferred and one-half
common, which took over the snuff business of the P.
Lorillard Company, Continental Tobacco Company and
The American Tobacco Company, with that of a large
competitor, viz: The Atlantic Snuff Co. The stock of
the new company was thus apportioned: Atlantic Snuff
Company, preferred, $7,500,000, common, $25,000,000;
P. Lorillard Company, preferred, $1,124,700, common,
$3,459,400; The American Tobacco Company, preferred,
$1,177,800, common, $3,227,500; Continental Tobacco
Company, preferred, $197,500, common, $813,100. The
stock issued to Continental Tobacco Company and the

defendants, P. Lorillard Company and the American
Tobacco Company, is still held by the latter, and they have
at all times had a controlling interest in the Snuff Company. All the companies, together with their officers
and directors, covenanted that they would not thereafter
engage as competitors in the tobacco business or the manufacture, sale, or distribution of snuff.
Among the assets transferred by the Atlantic Snuff
Company to American Snuff Company were all the shares
($600,000) of W. E. Garrett & Sons, Inc., then and now
one of the oldest and very largest producers of snuff, for
a long time and still engaged at Yorkland, Del., in interstate and foreign commerce in tobacco and its products,
and which controlled through stock ownership the Southern Snuff Company, Memphis, Tenn.; Dental Snuff Company, Lynchburg, Va., and Stewart-Ralph Snuff Company,
Clarksville, Tenn. The separate existence of W. E. Garrett & Sons, Inc., has been preserved and its business conducted under the corporate name. In March, 1900, the
American Snuff Company acquired all the shares of
George W. Helme Company, one of the oldest and largest
producers of snuff and actively engaged at Helmetta, N. J.,
in interstate and foreign commerce in competition with
defendants, by issuing in exchange therefor $2,000,000
preferred stock and $1,000,000 common; and it thereafter
took a conveyance of all assets of the acquired company
and now operates the plant under its own name.
As a result of the transactions just stated it came to pass
that the American Tobacco Company, which had at the
end of the first period only a very small percentage of the
snuff manufacturing business, came virtually to have the
dominant control as a manufacturer of that product.
2. Conley Foil Company--manufacturers of tinfoil, an
essentialfor packing tobacco products.
In December, 1899, the American Tobacco Company
secured control of the business of John Conley & Sons, a

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 169

Opinion of the Court.

partnership of New York City. By agreement the Conley
Foil Company was incorporated in New York "for trading and manufacturing," etc., with $250,000 capital, ultimately increased to $825,000. The corporation took
over the business and assets of the firm, and the American
Tobacco Company became owner of a majority of the
shares of stock. The Conley Foil Company has acquired
all the shares of stock of the Johnson Tinfoil & Metal
Company, of St. Louis, a leading competitor, and they
supply under fixed contracts at remunerative prices the
tinfoil used by the defendants, which constitutes the major
part of the total production in the United States.
3. American Cigar Company.
Prior to 1901 the American and Continental tobacco
companies manufactured, sold, and distributed cigars,
stogies, and cheroots. In the year stated the companies
determined to engage in the business upon a larger scale.
Under agreement with Powell, Smith & Company, large
manufacturers and dealers in cigars, they caused the incorporation in New Jersey of the American Cigar Company "for trading and manufacturing," etc., to which all
three conveyed their said business, and it has since carried
on the same. The American and Continental companies
each acquired 46Y2 per cent of the shares, and Powell,
Smith & Company 7 per cent; the original capitalization
was $10,000,000 (afterwards $20,000,000), and more than
three-fourths is owned by the former. The Cigar Company acquired many competitors (partnerships and corporations) engaged in interstate and foreign commerce,
taking from the parties covenants against engaging .in the
tobacco business; and it has also procured the organization of controlled corporations which have acquired competing manufacturers, jobbers and distributors in the
United States, Cuba and Porto Rico. It manufactures,
sells and distributes a considerable per centage of domestic
cigars; is the dominating factor in the tobacco business,

foreign and domestic, in Cuba and Porto Rico, and is
there engaged in tobacco planting. It also controls corporate jobbers in California, Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey and Tennessee.

4. The MacAndrews & Forbes Company--manufacturers
of licorice.
There is no question that licorice paste is an essential
ingredient in the manufacture of plug tobacco, and that
one who is debarred from obtaining such paste would therefore be unable to engage in or carry on the manufacture
of such product. The control over this article was thus
secured: In May, 1902, the Continental Company secured control of MacAndrews & Forbes Co. of Newark,
New Jersey, and organized "for trading and manufacturing" a corporation known as the MacAndrews & Forbes
Co., with a capital of $7,000,000, $4,000,000 preferred
and $3,000,000 common, which took over the business
of MacAndrews & Forbes and another large competitor.
The Continental Company acquired two-thirds of the
common stock by agreeing to purchase its supply of paste
from the new company. The American Tobacco Company, at the time of the filing the bill, was the owner of
$2,112,900 of the common stock and $750,000 preferred.
By various purchases and agreements the MacAndrews
& Forbes Company acquired, substantially, the business
of all competitors. Thus, in June, 1902, it purchased
the business of the Stamford Mfg. Co., of Stamford, Connecticut, and incorporated the National Licorice Company, which acquired the business of Young & Smylie
and F. B. & V. P. Scudder, and the National Company
agreed with MacAndrews & Forbes not to produce licorice
for tobacco manufacturers. In 1.906 all the stock in the
J. S. Young Company ($1,800,000), which had been organized to take over the business of the J. S. Young Co.
of Baltimore, Md., was acquired by the MacAndrews &
Forbes Co. The MacAndrews & Forbes Co. use in excess

Opinion of the Court.

of ninety-five per cent of the licorice root consumed in
the United States.
5. American Stogie Company.
In May, 1903, the American Cigar Company and the
American and Continental Tobacco Companies caused
the American Stogie Company to be incorporated in New
Jersey, with $11,979,000 capital, which immediately took
over the stogie and tobie business of the companies named
in exchange for $8,206,275 stock and then in the usual
ways acquired the business of others in the manufacture,
sale, and distribution of such products, with covenants
not to compete. It acquired in exchange for $3,647,725
stock all shares of United States Cigar Company (which
had previously acquired and owned the business of important competitors) and subsequently took the conveyance of the plant and assets. The majority shares always have been held by defendant, the American Cigar
Company.
As we think the legitimate inferences deducible from the
undisputed facts which we have thus stated will be sufficien t to dispose of the controversy, we do not deem it necessary to expand this statement so as to cause it to embrace
a recital of the undisputed facts concerning the entry of the
American Tobacco Company into the retail tobacco trade
through the acquisition of a controlling interest in the stock
of what is known as the United Cigar Stores Company,
as well as to some other subjects which for the sake of
brevity we likewise pass over, in order to come at once
to a statement concerning the foreign companies.
The English Companies.
In September, 1901, the American Tobacco Co. purchased for $5,347,000 a Liverpool (Eng.) corporation,
known as Ogden's Limited, there engaged in manufacturing and distributing tobacco products. A trade conflict
which at once ensued caused many of the English manufacturers to combine into an incorporation known as the

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland,
capital 15,000,000, afterwards increased to 18,000,000,
pounds sterling. The trade war was continued between
this corporation and the American Tobacco Company,
with a result substantially identical with that which had
hitherto, as we have seen, arisen from such a situation.
In September, 1902, the Imperial and the American
companies entered into contracts (executed in England)
stipulating that the former should limit its business to the
United Kingdom, except purchasing leaf in the United
States (it buys 54,000,000 pounds annually); that the
American companies should limit their business to the
United States, its dependencies and Cuba; and that the
British-American Tobacco Company, with capital of
6,000,000 pounds sterling apportioned between them,
should be organized, take over the export business of both,
and operate in other countries, etc. This arrangement,
was immediately put into effect, and has been observed.
The Imperial Company holds one-third and the American Company two-thirds of the capital stock of the BritishAmerican Tobacco Company, Limited. The latter company maintains a branch office in New York City and the
vice-president of the American Tobacco Company is a
principal officer. This company uses large quantities
of domestic leaf, partly exported to various plants abroad
and about half manufactured here and then exported.
By agreement, all this is purchased through the American
Tobacco Company. In addition to many plants abroad
it has warehouses in various States and plants at Petersburg, Va., and Durham, N. C., where tobacco is manufactured and then exported.
The purchase of necessary leaf tobacco in the United
States by the Imperial Company is now made through a
resident general agent and is exported as a part of foreign
commerce.
Not to break the continuity of the narrative of facts we

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 173
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

have omitted in the proper chronological order to state
the facts relative to what was known as the Consolidated
Tobacco Company. We now particularly refer to that
subject.
The Consolidated Tobacco Co.
In June, 1901, parties largely interested in the American
and Continental companies caused the incorporation in
New Jersey of the Consolidated Tobacco Company, capital $30,000,000 (afterwards $40,000,000), with broad powers and perpetual existence; to do business throughout
the world, and to guarantee securities of other companies,
etc. A majority of shares was taken by a few individuals
connected with the old concerns: A. N. Brady, J. B. Duke,
A. H. Payne, Thomas Ryan, W. C. Whitney, and P. A. B.
Widener. J. B. Duke, president of both the old companies, became president of the Consolidated. Largely
in exchange for bonds the new company acquired substantially all the shares of common stock of the old ones.
Its business, of holding and financing, was continued until
1904, when, with the American and Continental companies, it was merged into the present American Tobacco
Company.
By proceedings in New Jersey, October, 1904, the (old)
American Tobacco Company, Continental Tobacco Company and Consolidated Tobacco Company were merged
into one corporation, under the name of The American
Tobacco Company, the principal defendant here. The
merged company, with perpetual existence, was capitalized
at $180,000,000 ($80,000,000 preferred, ordinarily without power to vote).
The powers conferred by the charter are stated in the
margin.1

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

Prior to the merger the Consolidated Tobacco Company, a majority of whose $40,000,000 share capital was
held by J. B. Duke, Thomas F. Ryan, William C. Whitney,
Anthony N. Brady, Peter A. B. Widener and Oliver H.
Payne, had acquired, as already stated, nearly all common
shares of both old American and Continental companies,
and thereby control. The preferred shares, however,
were held by many individuals. Through the method of
distribution of the stock of the new company, in exchange
for shares in the old American and in the Continental
Company, it resulted that the same six men in control of
the combination through the Consolidated Tobacco Company continued that control by ownership of stock in the
merged or new American Tobacco Company. The assets,
property, etc., of the old companies passed to the American
Tobacco Company (merged), which has since carried on
the business.
The record indisputably discloses that after this merger
the same methods which were used from the beginning
continued to be employed. Thus, it is beyond dispute:
First, that since the organization of the new American
Tobacco Company that company has acquired four large
tobacco concerns, that restrictive covenants against engaging in the tobacco business were taken from the sellers,
and that the plants were not continued in operation but
to carry on any business operations deemed by such merged corporation to be necessary or advisable in connection with any of the objects
of its incorporation or in furtherance of any thereof, or tending to increase the value of its property or stock; . . . to conduct business
in all other States, territories, possessions and dependencies of the
United States of America, and in all foreign countries; . . . to
purchase or otherwise acquire and hold, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise dispose of the shares of the capital stock or
of any bonds, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness created by
any other corporation or corporations of this or any other State or
government, and to issue its own obligations in payment or exchange

therefor.

.

were at once abandoned. Second, that the new company
has besides acquired control of eight additional concerns,
the business of such concerns being now carried on by four
separate corporations, all absolutely controlled by the
American Tobacco Company, although the connection
as to two of these companies with that corporation was
long and persistently denied.
Thus reaching the end of the second period and coming
to the time of the bringing of the suit, brevity prevents
us from stopping to portray the difference between the condition in 1890 when the (old) American Tobacco Company was organized by the consolidation of five competing
cigarette concerns and that which existed at the commencement of the suit. That situation and the vast
power which the principal and accessory corporate defendants and the small number of individuals who own a
majority of the common stock of the new American
Tobacco Company exert over the marketing of tobacco
as a raw product, its manufacture, its marketing when
manufactured, and its consequent movement in the channels of interstate commerce indeed relatively over foreign
commerce, and the commerce of the whole world, in the
raw and manufactured products stand out in such bold
relief from the undisputed facts which have been stated
as to lead us to pass at once to the second fundamental
proposition which we are required to consider. That is,
the construction of the Anti-trust Act and the application
of the act as rightly construed to the situation as proven
in consequence of having determined the ultimate and final
inferences properly deducible from the undisputed facts
which we have stated.

The construction and application of the Anti-trust Act.
If the Anti-trust Act is applicable to the entire situation
here presented and is adequate to afford complete relief
for the evils which the United States insists that situation
presents it can only be because that law will be given a

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

more comprehensive application than has been affixed
to it in any previous decision. This will be the case because the undisputed facts as we have stated them involve questions as to the operation of the Anti-trust Act
not hitherto presented in any case. Thus, even if the
ownership of stock by the American Tobacco Company
in the accessory and subsidiary companies and the ownership of stock in any of those companies among themselves
were held, as was decided in United States v. Standard Oil
Co., to be a violation of the act and all relations resulting from such stock ownership were therefore set aside,
the question would yet remain whether the principal defendant, the American Tobacco Company, and the five
accessory defendants, even when divested of their stock
ownership in other corporations, by virtue of the power
which they would continue to possess, even although thus
stripped, would amount to a violation of both the first
and second sections of the act. Again, if it were held that
the corporations, the existence whereof was due to a combination between such companies and other companies
was a violation of the act, the question would remain
whether such of the companies as did not owe their existence and power to combinations but whose power alone
arose from the exercise of the right to acquire and own
property would be amenable to the prohibitions of the act.
Yet further: Even if this proposition was held in the
affirmative the question would remain whether the principal defendant, the American Tobacco Company, when
stripped of its stock ownership, would be in and of itself
within the prohibitions of the act although that company
was organized and took being before the Anti-trust Act
was passed. Still further, the question would yet remain
whether particular corporations which, when. bereft of
the power which they possessed as resulting from stock
ownership, although they were not inherently possessed
of a sufficient residuum of power to cause them to be in

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 177
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and of themselves either a restraint of trade or a monopolization or an attempt to monopolize, should nevertheless
be restrained because of their intimate connection and association with other corporations found to be within the
prohibitions of the act. The necessity of relief as to all
these aspects, we think, seemed to the Government so essential, and the difficulty of giving to the act such a comprehensive and coherent construction as would be adequate
to enable it to meet the entire situation, led to what appears
to us to be in their essence a resort to methods of construction not compatible one with the other. And the same apparent conflict is presented by the views of the act taken
by the defendants when their contentions are accurately
tested. Thus the Government, for the purpose of fixing the
illegal character of the original combination which organized the old American Tobacco Company, asserts that the
illegal character of the combination is plainly shown because the combination was brought about to stay the progress of a flagrant and ruinous trade war. In other words,
the contention is that as the act forbids every contract,
and combination, it hence prohibits a reasonable and just
agreement made for the purpose of ending a trade war.
But as thus construing the act by the rule of the letter
which kills, would necessarily operate to take out of the
reach of the act some one of the accessory and many subsidiary corporations, the existence of which depend not
at all upon combination or agreement or contract, but upon
mere purchases of property, it is insisted in many forms
of argument that the rule of construction to be applied
must be the spirit and intent of the act and therefore its
prohibitions must be held to extend to acts even if not
within the literal terms of the statute if they arc within
its spirit because done with an intent to bring about the
harmful results which it was the purpose of the statute
to prohibit. So as to the defendants. While it is argued
on the one hand that the forms by which various properties
VOL. ccxxi-12

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

were acquired in view of the letter of the act exclude many
of the assailed transactions from condemnation, it is yet
urged that giving to the act the broad construction which
it should rightfully receive, whatever may be the form,
no condemnation should follow, because, looking at the
case as a whole, every act assailed is shown to have been
but a legitimate and lawful result of the exertion of honest
business methods brought into play for the purpose of
advancing trade instead of with the object of obstructing
and restraining the same. But the difficulties which
arise, from the complexity of the particular dealings which
are here involved and the situation which they produce,
we think grows out of a plain misconception of both the
letter and spirit of the Anti-trust Act. We say of the
letter, because while seeking by a narrow rule of the letter
to include things which it is deemed would otherwise be
excluded, the contention really destroys the great purpose
of the act, since it renders it impossible to apply the law
to a multitude of wrongful acts, which would come within
the scope of its remedial purposes by resort to a reasonable
construction, although they would not be within its reach
by a too narrow and unreasonable adherence to the strict
letter. This must be the case unless it be possible in
reason to say that for the purpose of including one class
of acts which would not otherwise be embraced a literal
construction although in conflict with reason must be
applied and for the purpose of including other acts which
would not otherwise be embraced a reasonable construction
must be resorted to. That is to say two conflicting rules
of construction must at one and the same time be applied
and adhered to.
The obscurity and resulting uncertainty however, is
now but an abstraction because it has been removed by the
consideration which we have given quite recently to the
construction of the Anti-trust Act in the Standard Oil
Case. In that case it was held, without departing from

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 179
221U. S.

Opinion of

the Court.

any previous decision of the court that as the statute had
not defined the words restraint of trade, it became necessary to construe those words, a duty which could only be
discharged by a resort to reason. We say the doctrine
thus stated was in accord with all the previous decisions
of this court, despite the fact that the contrary view was
sometimes erroneously attributed to some of the expressions used in two prior decisions (the Trans-Missouri
Freight Association and Joint Traffic cases, 166 U. S. 290,
and 171 U. S. 505). That such view was a mistaken one
was fully pointed out in the Standard Oil Case and is additionally shown by a passage in the opinion in the Joint
Traffic Case as follows (171 U. S. 568): "The act of Congress must have a reasonable construction, or else there
would scarcely be an agreement or contract among
business men that could not be said to have, indirectly
or remotely, some bearing on interstate commerce, and
possibly to restrain it." Applying the rule of reason to
the construction of the statute, it was held in the Standard
Oil Case that as the words "restraint of trade" at common
law and in the law of this country at the time of the adoption of the Anti-trust Act only embraced acts or contracts
or agreements or combinations which operated to the
prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the due course of trade or
which, either because of their inherent nature or effect
or because of the evident purpose of the acts, etc., injuriously restrained trade, that the words as used in the
statute were designed to have and did have but a like
significance. It was therefore pointed out that the statute did not forbid or restrain the power to make normal
and usual contracts to further trade by resorting to all
normal methods, whether by agreement or otherwise, to
accomplish such purpose. In other words, it was held,
not that acts which the statute prohibited could be removed from the control of its prohibitions by a finding

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

that they were reasonable, but that the duty to interpret
which inevitably arose from the general character of the
term restraint of trade required that the words restraint
of trade should be given a meaning which would not destroy the individual right to contract and render difficult
if not impossible any movement of trade in the channels
of interstate commerce-the free movement of which it
was the purpose of the statute to protect. The soundness
of the rule that the statute should receive a reasonable
construction, after further mature deliberation, we see
no reason to doubt. Indeed, the necessity for not departing in this case from the standard of the rule of reason
which is universal in its application is so plainly required
in order to give effect to the remedial purposes which the
act under consideration contemplates, and to prevent that
act from destroying all liberty of contract and all substantial right to trade, and thus causing the act to be at
war with itself by annihilating the fundamental right of
freedom to trade which, on the very face of the act, it was
enacted to preserve, is illustrated by the record before us.
In truth, the plain demonstration which this record gives
of the injury which would arise from and the promotion
of the wrongs which the statute was intended to guard
against which would result from giving to the statute a
narrow, unreasoning and unheard of construction, as
illustrated by the record before us, if possible serves to
strengthen our conviction as to the correctness of the rule
of construction, the rule of reason, which was applied in
the Standard Oil Case, the application of which rule to the
statute we now, in the most unequivocal terms, re~xpress
and re-affirm.
Coming then to apply to the case before us the act as
interpreted in the Standard Oil and previous cases, all
the difficulties suggested by the mere form in which the
assailed transactions are clothed become of no moment.
This follows because although it was held in the Standard

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 181
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Oil Case that, giving to the statute a reasonable construction, the words "restraint of trade" did not embrace all
those normal and usual contracts essential to individual
freedom and the right to make which were necessary in
order that the course of trade might be free, yet, as a result
of the reasonable construction which was affixed to 'the
statute, it was pointed out that the generic designation
of the first and second sections of the law, when taken
together, embraced every conceivable act which could
possibly come within the spirit or purpose of the prohibitions of the law, without regard to the garb in which
such acts were clothed. That is to say, it was held that
in view of the general language of the statute and the public policy which it manifested, there was no possibility
of frustrating that policy by resorting to any disguise
or subterfuge of form, since resort to reason rendered it
impossible to escape by any indirection the prohibitions
of the statute.
Considering then the undisputed facts which we have
previously stated, it remains only to determine whether
they establish that the acts, contracts, agreements, combinations, etc., which were assailed were of such an unusual and wrongful character as to bring them within the
prohibitions of the law. That they were, in our opinion,
so overwhelmingly results from the undisputed facts that
it seems only necessary to refer to the facts as we have
stated them to demonstrate the correctness of this conclusion. Indeed, the history of the combination is so
replete with the doing of acts which it was the obvious
purpose of the statute to forbid, so demonstrative of the
existence from the beginning of a purpose to acquire
dominion and control of the tobacco trade, not by the mere
exertion of the ordinary right to contract and to trade,
but by methods devised in order to monopolize the trade
by driving competitors out of business, which were ruthlessly carried out upon the assumption that to work upon

the fears or play upon the cupidity of competitors would
make success possible. We say these conclusions are inevitable, not because of the vast amount of property aggregated by the combination, not because alone of the many
corporations which the proof shows were united by resort
to one device or another. Again, not alone because of the
dominion and control over the tobacco trade which actually exists, but because we think the conclusion of wrongful
purpose and illegal combination is overwhelmingly established by the following considerations: a. By the fact
that the very first organization or combination was impelled by a previously existing fierce trade war, evidently
inspired by one or more of the minds which brought about
and became parties to that combination. b. Because,
immediately after that combination and the increase of
capital which followed, the acts which ensued justify the
inference that the intention existed to use the power of
the combination as a vantage ground to further monopolize the trade in tobacco by means of trade conflicts
designed to injure others, either by driving competitors
out of the business or compelling them to become parties
to a combination-a purpose whose execution was illustrated by the plug war which ensued and its results,
by the snuff war which followed and its results, and by
the conflict which immediately followed the entry of the
combination in England and the division of the world's
business by the two foreign contracts which ensued.
c. By the ever-present manifestation which is exhibited
of a conscious wrongdoing by the form in which the various
transactions were embodied from the beginning, ever
changing but ever in substance the same. Now the organization of a new company, now the control exerted by
the taking of stock in one or another or in several, so as to
obscure the result actually attained, nevertheless uniform,
in their manifestations of the purpose to restrain others
and to monopolize and retain power in the hands of the

UNIrD STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO Co. 183
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

few who, it would seem, from the beginning contemplated
the mastery of the trade which practically followed.
d. By the gradual absorption of control over all the elements essential to the successful manufacture of tobacco
products, and placing such control in the hands of seemingly independent corporations serving as perpetual barriers to the entry of others into the tobacco trade. e. By
persistent expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars
in buying out plants, not for the purpose of utilizing them,
but in order to close them up and render them useless for
the purposes of trade. f. By the constantly recurring
stipulations, whose legality, isolatedly viewed, we are not
considering, by which numbers of persons, whether manufacturers, stockholders or employ~s, were required to bind
themselves, generally for long periods, not to compete in
the future. Indeed, when the results of the undisputed
proof which we have stated are fully apprehended, and
the wrongful acts which they exhibit are considered, there
comes inevitably to the mind the conviction that it wasjthe
danger which it was deemed would arise to individual
liberty and the public well-being from acts like those which
this record exhibits, which led the legislative mind to conceive and to enact the Anti-trust Act, considerations which
also serve to clearly demonstrate that the combination here
assailed is within the law as to leave no doubt that it is
our plain duty to apply its prohibitions.
In stating summarily, as we have done, the conclusions
which, in our opinion, are plainly deducible from the undisputed facts, we have not paused to give the reasons
why we consider, after great consideration, that the elaborate arguments advanced to affix a different complexion
to the case are wholly devoid of merit. We do not, for
the sake of brevity, moreover, stop to examine and discuss the various propositions urged in the argument at
bar for the purpose of demonstrating that the subjectmatter of the combination which we find to exist and the

OCTO3ER TERM, 1910.

221 U. S.

combination itself are not within the scope of the Antitrust Act because when rightly considered they are merely
matters of intrastate commerce and therefore subject alone
to state control. We have done this because the want
of merit in all the arguments advanced on such subjects
is so completely established by the prior decisions of this
court, as pointed out in the Standard Oil Case, as not to
require restatement.
Leading as this does to the conclusion that the assailed
combination in all its aspects-that is to say, whether
it be looked at from the point of view of stock ownership
or from the standpoint of the principal corporation and
the accessory or subsidiary corporations viewed independently, including the foreign corporations in so far
as by the contracts made by them they became co6perators in the combination-comes within the prohibitions
of the first and second sections of the Anti-trust Act,
it remains only finally to consider the remedy which it
is our duty to apply to the situation thus found to exist.
The remedy.
Our conclusion being that the combination as a whole,
involving all its co6perating or associated parts, in whatever form clothed, constitutes a restraint of trade within
the first section, and an attempt to monopolize or a
monopolization within the second section of the Antitrust Act, it follows that the relief which we are to afford
must be wider than that awarded by the lower court,
since that court merely decided that certain of the corporate defendants constituted combinations in violation
of the first section of the act, because of the fact that they
were formed by the union of previously competing concerns and that the other defendants not dismissed from
the action were parties to such combinations or promoted
their purposes. We hence, in determining the relief
proper to be given, may not model our action upon that
granted by the court below, but in order to enable us to

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 185
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

award relief coterminous with the ultimate redress of the
wrongs which we find to exist, we must approach the subject of relief from an original point of view. Such subject necessarily takes a two-fold aspect-the character
of the permanent relief required and the nature of the temporary relief essential to be applied pending the working
out of permanent relief in the event that it be found that
it is impossible under the situation as it now exists to at
once rectify such existing wrongful condition. In considering the subject from both of these aspects three
dominant influences must guide our action: 1. The duty
of giving complete and efficacious effect to the prohibitions of the statute; 2, the accomplishing of this result
with as little injury as possible to the interest of the general
public; and, 3, a proper regard for the vast interests of
private property which may have become vested in many
persons as a result of the acquisition either by way of stock
ownership or otherwise of interests in the stock or securities of the combination without any guilty knowledge
or intent in any way to become actors or participants in
the wrongs which we find to have inspired and dominated
the combination from the beginning. Mindful of these
considerations and to clear the way for their application
we say at the outset without stopping to amplify the rea-sons which lead us to that conclusion, we think that the
court below clearly erred in dismissing the individual
defendants, the United Cigar Stores Company, and the
foreign corporations and their subsidiary corporations.
Looking at the situation as we have hitherto pointed
it out, it involves difficulties in the application of remedies
greater than have been presented by any case involving
the Anti-trust Act which has been hitherto considered
by this court: First. Because in this case it is obvious
that a mere decree forbidding stock ownership by one
part of the combination in another part or entity thereof,
would afford no adequate measure of relief, since different

221 U. 9.

ingredients of the combination would remain unaffected,
and by the very nature and character of their organization would be able to continue the wrongful situation
which it is our duty to destroy. Second. Because the
methods of apparent ownership by which the wrongful
intent was, in part, carried out and the subtle devices
which, as we have seen, were resorted to for the purpose
of accomplishing the wrong contemplated, by way of
ownership or otherwise, are of such a character that it
is difficult if not impossible to formulate a remedy which
could restore in their entirety the prior lawful conditions.
Third. Because the methods devised by which the various
essential elements to the successful operation of the tobacco business from any particular aspect have been so
separated under various subordinate combinations, yet
so unified by way of the control worked out by the scheme
here condemned, are so involved that any specific form of
relief which we might now order in substance and effect
might operate really to injure the public and, it may be,
to perpetuate the wrong. Doubtless it was the presence
of these difficulties which caused the United States, in its
prayer for relief to tentatively suggest rather than to specifically demand definite and precise remedies. We might
at once resort to one or the other of two general remedies-a, the allowance of a permanent injunction restraining the combination as a universality and all the individuals and corporations which form a part of or co6perate
in it in any manner or form from continuing to engage
in interstate commerce until the illegal situation be cured,
a measure of relief which would accord in substantial
effect with that awarded below to the extent that the court
found illegal combinations to exist; or, b, to direct the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the assets and
property in this country of the combination in all its
ramifications for the purpose of preventing a continued
violation of the law, and thus working out by a sale of the

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOACCO CO. 181
221 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

property of the combination or otherwise, a condition of
things which would not be repugnant to the prohibitions
of the act. But, having regard to the principles which
we have said must control our action, we do not think we
can now direct the immediate application of either of these
remedies. We so consider as to the first because in view
of the extent of the combination, the vast field which it
covers, the all-embracing character of its activities concerning tobacco and its products, to at once stay the movement in interstate commerce of the products which the
combination or its cobperating forces produce or control
might inflict infinite injury upon the public by leading to a
stoppage of supply and a great enhancement of prices.
The second because the extensive power which would result
from at once resorting to a receivership might not only do
grievous injury to the public, but also cause widespread
and perhaps irreparable loss to many innocent people.
Under these circumstances, taking into mind the complexity of the situation in all of its aspects and giving
weight to the many-sided considerations which must
control our judgment, we think, so far as the permanent
relief to be awarded is concerned, we should decree as follows: 1st. That the combination in and of itself, as well
as each and all of the elements composing it, whether
corporate or individual, whether considered collectively
or separately, be decreed to be in restraint of trade and
an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization within the
first and second sections of the Anti-trust Act. 2d. That
the court below, in order to give effective force to our
decree in this regard, be directed to hear the parties, by
evidence or otherwise, as it may be deemed proper, for
the purpose of ascertaining and determining upon some
plan or method of dissolving the combination and of recreating, out of the elements now composing it, a new
condition which shall be honestly in harmony with and
not repugnant to the law. 3d. That for the accomplish-

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

221 U. S.

ment of these purposes, taking into view the difficulty
of the situation, a period of six months is allowed from the
receipt of our mandate, with leave, however, in the event,
in the judgment of the court below, the necessities of the
situation require, to extend such period to a further time
not to exceed sixty days. 4th. That in the event, before
the expiration of the period thus fixed, a condition of
disintegration in harmony with the law is not brought
about, either as the consequence of the action of the court
in determining an issue on the subject or in accepting a
plan agreed upon, it shall be the duty of the court, either
by way of an injunction restraining the movement of the
products of the combination in the channels of interstate
or foreign commerce or by the appointment of a receiver,
to give effect to the requirements of the statute.
Pending the bringing about of the result just stated,
each and all of the defendants, individuals as well as corporations, should be restrained from doing any act which
might further extend or enlarge the power of the combination, by any means or device whatsoever. In view
of the considerations we have stated we leave the matter
to the court below to work out a compliance with the law
without unnecessary injury to the public or the rights
of private property.
While in many substantial respects our conclusion is in
accord with that reached by the court below, and while
also the relief which we think should be awarded in some
respects is coincident with that which the court granted,
in order to prevent any complication and to clearly define
the situation we think instead of affirming and modifying,
our decree, in view of the broad nature of our conclusions,
should be one of reversal and remanding with directions
to the court below to enter a decree in conformity with
this opinion and to take such further steps as may be necessary to fully carry out the directions which we have given.
And it is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurring in part and dissenting

in part.
I concur with many things said in the opinion just delivered for the court, but it contains some observations
from which I am compelled to withhold my assent.
I agree most thoroughly with the court in holding that
the principal defendant, the American Tobacco Company
and its accessory and subsidiary corporations and companies, including the defendant English corporations, constitute a combination which, "in and of itself, as well as
each and all of the elements composing it, whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or
separately," is illegal under the Anti-trust Act of 1890, and
should be decreed to be in restraint of interstate trade and
an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization of part of
such trade.
The evidence in the record is, I think, abundant to
enable the court to render a decree containing all necessary
details for the suppression of the evils of the combination
in question. But the case is sent back, with directions further to hear the parties, by evidence or otherwise, "for the
purpose of ascertaining and determining upon some plan
or method of dissolving the combination, and of recreating out of the elements now composing it, a new condition"
which shall not be repugnant to law. The court, in its
opinion, says of the present combination, that its illegal
purposes are overwhelmingly established by many facts,
among others, "by the ever-present manifestation which
is exhibited of a conscious wrong-doing by the form in which,
the various transactions were embodied from the beginning,
ever changing, but ever in substance the same. Now the
organization of a new company, now the control exerted
by the taking of stock in one or another, or in several, so
as to obscure the result actually attained, nevertheless
uniform in their manifestations of the purpose to restrain

others, and to monopolize and retain power in the hands of
the few, who, it would seem, from the beginning contemplated the mastery of the trade which practically followed.
By the gradual absorption of control over all the elements
essential to the successful manufacture of tobacco products
and placing such control in the hands of seemingly independent corporations serving as perpetual barriers to the
entry of others into the tobacco trade." The court further says of this combination and monopoly: "The history of the combination is so replete with the doing of acts
which it was the obvious purpose of the statute to forbid,
so demonstrative of the existence, from the beginning, of a
purpose to acquire dominion and control of the tobacco
trade, not by the mere exertion of the ordinary right to
contract and to trade, but by methods devised to monopolize the trade, by driving competitors out of business,
which were ruthlessly carried out, upon the assumption
that to work upon the fears or play upon the cupidity of
competitors would make success possible."
But it seems that the course I have suggested is not to
be pursued. The case is to go back to the Circuit Court
in order that out of the elements of the old combination
a new condition may be "re-created" that will not be in
violation of the law. I confess my inability to find, in the
history 'of this combination, anything to justify the wish
that a new condition should be "re-created" out of the
mischievous elements that compose the present combination, which, together with its component parts, have, without ceasing, pursued the vicious methods pointed out by
the court. If the proof before us-as it undoubtedly
does-warrants the characterization which the court
has made of this monster combination, why cannot all
necessary directions be now given as to the terms of the
decree? In my judgment, there is enough in the record
to enable this court to formulate specific directions as to
what the decree should contain. Such directions would

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 191

HARLAN,

J., concurring and dissenting.

not only end this litigation, but would serve to protect the
public against any more conscious wrong-doing by those
who have persistently and "ruthlessly," to use this court's
language, pursued illegal methods to defeat the act of
Congress.
I will not say what, in my opinion, should be the form
of the decree, nor speculate as to what the details ought to
be. It will be time enough to speak on that subject when
we have the decree before us. I will, however, say now
that in my opinion the decree below should be affirmed
as to the Tobacco company and its accessory and subsidiary companies, and reversed on the cross appeal of the
Government.
But my objections have also reference to those parts
of the court's opinion reaffirming what it said recently in
the Standard Oil Case about the former decisions of this
court touching the Anti-trust Act. We are again reminded,
as we were in the Standard Oil Case, of the necessity of applying the "rule of reason" in the construction of this act
of Congress-an act expressed, as I think, in language so
clear and simple that there is no room whatever for construction.
Congress, with full and exclusive power over the whole
subject, has signified its purpose to forbid every restraint
of interstate trade, in whatever form, or to whatever extent, but the court has assumed to insert in the act, by
construction merely, words which make Congress say that
it means only to prohibit the "undue" restraint of trade.
If I do not misapprehend the opinion just delivered,
the court insists that what was said in the opinion in the
Standard Oil Case, was in accordance with our previous
decisions in the Trans-Missouri and Joint Traffic cases,
166 U. S. 290, 171 U. S. 505, if we resort to reason. This
statement surprises me quite as much as would a statement that black was white or white was black. It is
scarcely just to the majority in those two cases for the

court at this late day to say or to intimate that they interpreted the act of Congress without regard to the "rule of
reason," or to assume, as the court now does, that the act
was, for the first time in the Standard Oil Case, interpreted in the "light of reason." One thing is certain,
"rule of reason," to which the court refers, does not justify
the perversion of the plain words of an act in order to defeat the will of Congress.
By every conceivable form of expression, the majority,
in the Trans-Missouri and Joint Traffic cases, adjudged
that the act of Congress did not allow restraint of interstate trade to any extent or in any form, and three times
it expressly rejected the theory, which had been persistently advanced, that the act should be construed as if it
had in it the word "unreasonable" or "undue." But now
the court, in accordance with what it denominates the
"rule of reason," in effect inserts in the act the word
"undue," which means the same as "unreasonable," and
thereby makes Congress say what it did not say, what, as
I think, it plainly did not intend to say and what, since the
passage of the act, it has explicitly refused to say. It has
steadily refused to amend the act so as to tolerate a restraint of interstate commerce even where such restraint
could be said to be "reasonable" or "due." In short, the
court now, by judicial legislation, in effect amends an act
of Congress relating to a subject over which that department of the Government has exclusive cognizance. I
beg to say that, in my judgment, the majority, in the
former cases, were guided by the "rule of reason;" for, it
may be assumed that they knew quite as well as others
what the rules of reason require when a court seeks to ascertain the will of Congress as expressed in a statute. It is
obvious from the opinions in the former cases, that the majority did not grope about in darkness, but in discharging
the solemn duty put on them they stood out in the full glare
of the "light of reason" and felt and said time and again

UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. 193

HARLAN,

that the court could not, consistently with the Constitution, and would not, usurp the functions of Congress by indulging in judicial legislation. They said in express words,
in the former cases, in response to the earnest contentions
of counsel, that to insert by construction the word "unreasonable" or "undue" in the act of Congress would
be judicial legislation. Let me say, also, that as we all
agree that the combination in question was illegal under
any construction of the Anti-trust Act, there was not the
slightest necessity to enter upon an extended argument
to show that the act of Congress was to be read as if it

These views are fully discussed in the dissenting opinion
delivered by me in the Standard Oil Case. I will not repeat what is therein stated, but it may be well to cite an
additional authority. In the Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S.
82, the court was asked to sustain the constitutionality of
the statute there involved. But the statute could not have
been sustained except by inserting in it words not put there
by Congress. Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said: "If we should, in the
case before us, undertake to make by judicial construction a law which Congress did not make, it is quite probable
we should do what, if the matter were now before that
body, it would be unwilling to do." This language was
cited with approval in Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S.
463, 502. I refer to my dissenting opinion in the Standard
Oil Case, ante, p. 82, as containing a full statement of my
views of this particular question.
For the reasons stated, I concur in part with the court's
opinion and dissent in part.
