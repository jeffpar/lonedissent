OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Counsel for Petitioner.

236 U. S.

In view of the well-known purposes of the Bankrupt
Law exceptions to the operation of a discharge thereunder
should be confined to those plainly expressed; and while
much might be said in favor of extending these to liabilities incurred for services obtained by fraud the language
of the act does not go so far.
The court below reached a proper conclusion and its
judgment is
Affirmed.

McCOACH, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. PRATT, EXECUTOR OF DREER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 149.

Argued January 25, 1915.-Decided March 1, 1915.

Where testator died before July 1, 1902, but creditors had the right,
under the local law, as in Pennsylvania, to file claims within a year,
and legatees cannot demand payment out of the personal estate
until after ascertainment that there is a residue available for payment of legacies, the interests of the legatees were not absolutely
vested in possession or enjoyment prior to July 1, 1902, and the
tax paid on such legacies under the War Revenue Act of 1898 should,
pursuant to § 3 of the act of June 27, 1902, be refunded. United
States v. Jones, ante, p. 106, followed, and Hertz v. Woodman, 218
U. S. 205, distinguished.
201 Fed. Rep. 1021, affirmed.

facts, which involve the construction of the War
Revenue Act of 1898 and the refunding act of June 27,
1902, are stated in the opinion.
THE

Mr. Assistant Attorney GeneraliWallace, with whom The
Solicitor General was on the brief' for petitioner:

McCOACH v. PRATT.
236 U. S.

Argument for Petitioner.

Taxability of the direct bequests depends on taxability
of the annuities to the grandchildren. They are taxable
under § 29, act of 1898.
Legacy includes annuity and there is no legal difference
between it and life estate in income.
Whether the estate is vested or contingent, and however
it is called, it is taxable because not conditional. United
States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 159; Vanderbilt v.
Eidman, 196 U. S. 490.
The fact of deferred payment is immaterial. The tax
was here imposed before July 1, 1902.
The claim of the executors under the repealing act of
April 12, 1902, is unfounded. Hertz v. Woodman, 218
U. S. 205.
These annuities were not affected by the act of June 27,
1902, because they were not contingent.
Actual possession is not prerequisite to taxability, nor
is the determination of the residue a prerequisite to taxability.
The title to all personalty vests in executors upon probate.
Each right, in the executors and in the beneficiaries
alike, vested at testator's death, and were not within the
operation of either act of 1902.
Section 51, Pennsylvania laws, yields to the expressed
intention of testator. Section 22 gives a full year to
present claims. United States v. Jones, ante, p. 106, does
not apply, as the tax mustbe paid before claims could be
adjudged in probate; and the executor must declare
amount of tax in his schedule.
Section 30 expressly authorizes collection without administration of estate. The adjudication of. claims is unnecessary.
The rule in the Jones Case, if so construed, would cut
off all taxes at least one year back of July 1, 1902.
The refunding act cannot apply in this case.

McCOACH v. PRATT.
236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
Whether a succession tax collected under §§ 29 and 30
of the act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 464, shall
be refunded is the matter here in controversy. The facts
bearing upon its solution are these: Ferdinand J. Dreer, a
resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, died May 24,
1902, leaving a will directing that certain legacies be paid
out of his personal estate to two sons and two grandchildren. The executors took charge of the property and
proceeded to administer it under the supervision of the
Orphans' Court, as the local law required, first for the
benefit of the creditors and next for the benefit of the
legatees.. The former had a year within which to file their
claims and the latter were not entitled to demand payment of the legacies until that time expired, and then
only in the event there was a residue available for the
purpose. Jones' Appeal, 99 Pa. St. 124, 130; Rastaetter's
Estate, 15 Pa. Sup. Ct. 549, 553-555. On July 1, 1902, a
date the importance of which will be seen presently, less
than two months of the prescribed year had passed, and
whether there would be a residue for the payment of
legacies was as yet undetermined. In July, 1903, the Collector of Internal Revenue demanded of the executors a
succession tax of $1,692.75 on account of the legacies and
the tax was paid under protest. Shortly thereafter the
executors sought, in the appropriate way, to have the tax
refunded, but the request was denied, and they then sued
the Collector to recover back the amount. In the Circuit
Court the executors prevailed and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 201 Fed. Rep.
1021.
By § 29 of the act of 1898 an executor, administrator or
trustee having in charge a legacy or distributive share,
exceeding $10,000 in actual value, arising from personal

property and passing from a decedent to another by will
or intestate laws was subjected to a tax graduated according to the value of the legacy or distributive share; but
that section was repealed by the act of April 12, 1902,
c. 500, 32 Stat. 96, with a qualification that the repeal
should not be effective until July 1 following and should
not prevent the collection of any tax imposed prior to the
latter date. Next came the act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160,
32 Stat. 406, the third section of which reads as follows:
"That in all cases where an executor, administrator, or
trustee shall have paid, or shall hereafter pay, any tax
upon any legacy or distributive share of personal property
under the provisions of the Act approved June thirteenth,
eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, entitled 'An Act to
provide ways and means to meet war expenditures, and
for other purposes,' and amendments thereof, the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized and
directed to refund, out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated, upon proper application being
made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under
such rules and regulations as may be prescribed, so much
of said tax as may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have become vested prior
to July first, nineteen hundred and two. And no tax shall
hereafter be assessed or imposed under said Act approved
June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, upon
or in respect of any contingent beneficial interest which
shall not become absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment prior to said July first, nineteen hundred and
two."
As the context shows, the word "vested" in the first
sentence has the same meaning as "absolutely vested in
possession or enjoyment" in the second, Vanderbilt v.
Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, 500; United States v. Fidelity Trust
Co., 222 U. S. 158, and the words "contingent" and "absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment" are used

Opinion of the Court.

antithetically and applied to both legacies and distributive
shares. What is meant by "contingent" is indicated by
the phrase with which it is contrasted and by its application to distributive shares as well as to legacies. The only
sense in which the former are contingent-and it is practical rather than technical-is that they come into being
only where, in due course of administration, the debts of
the deceased are ascertained and it is found that a surplus
remains for distribution. It is in this sense that the word
is applied to distributive shares, and, of course, it is applied to legacies in the same way. In speaking of this section, we said in United States v. Jones, ante, p. 106, at
p. 113: "It deals with legacies and distributive shares
upon the same plane, treats both as 'contingent' interests
until they 'become absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment,' directs that the tax collected upon contingent
interests not so vested prior to July 1, 1902, shall be refunded, and forbids any further enforcement of the tax as
respects interests remaining contingent up to that date."
That case related to a tax collected upon distributive
shares in an estate in Pennsylvania. The intestate had
died before July 1, 1902, but the time for presenting claims
against the estate had not expired prior to that date, and
therefore what, if any, surplus would remain was still uncertain and the heirs were not as yet entitled to a distribution. It was accordingly held that the distributive shares
did not become "absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment" before July 1, 1902, but remained contingent in the
sense of the statute, and consequently that the tax should
be refunded.' The present case differs from that only in
the fact that here the tax was collected upon legacies. This
difference is not material. The refunding act deals with
both in the same way and the local law subordinates the
rights of legatees to those of creditors in like manner as
it does the rights of distributees. It follows that the tax
here in question must be refunded.

Statement of the Case.

236 U. S.

The case of Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, is relied
upon by the Government, as it was in United States v.
Jones, supra, but for reasons there given we think it is
not in point here.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.

KTRMEYER v. STATE OF KANSAS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
No. 145.

Argued January 22, 1915.-Decided March 1, 1915.

Beer is a recognized article of commerce, and the right to send it from

one State to another, and the act of doing so, are interstate commerce,
the regulation whereof has been committed to Congress, and a state
law interfering with or handling the same conflicts with the Federal
Constitution.
Transportation is not complete until delivery to the consignee or the
expiration of a reasonable time therefor and prior thereto the provisions of the Wilson Act of August 8, 1890, do not apply.
Whether commerce is interstate or intrastate must be tested by the
actual transaction; it does not depend upon the methods employed,
distance between the points, or the domicil or character of the parties
engaged therein.
The packages in which goods involved in this case were transported
in interstate commerce were those customarily used for transportation of such articles, and not a mere plan or device to defeat the
policy of the State, and the rulings in that respect in Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343, and Cook v. Marshall County, 196 U. S. 261, do
not apply.
88 Kansas, 589, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution,
are stated in the opinion.
