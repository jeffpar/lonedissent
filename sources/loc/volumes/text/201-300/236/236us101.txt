DENVER v. HOME SAVINGS BANK.
236 U S.

Argument for Petitioner.

BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER v. HOME
SAVINGS BANK.
WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 126.

Argued January 15, 1915.-Decided January 26, 1915.

No exception or bill of exception is necessary to open a question of law
apparent on the record where the record shows no waiver of rights
of plaintiffs in error. Nalle v. Oyster, 230 U. S. 165.
When a municipality is authorized to raise money by sale of bonds this
court will take it that the authority extends to putting the bonds in
the form that would be necessary to obtain a purchaser. And this
applies also to certificates of indebtedness.
There is no essential. difference between bonds of a municipality and
its certificates of indebtedness, and in this case held that the purchasers for value before maturity and in good faith of negotiable
certificates of indebtedness of the City of Denver were entitled to
recover, and the defense that the authority to issue certificates did
not authorize making them negotiable could not be maintained.
200 Fed. Rep. 28, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the validity of certificates
of indebtedness issued by the City and County of Denver
in payment for voting machines, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. CharlesR. Brock, with whom Mr. I. N. Stevens, Mr.
Milton Smith and Mr. William H. Ferguson were on the
brief, for petitioner:
An exception to the ruling of the trial court upon a
demurrer is not a condition precedent to the right to have
that ruling reviewed upon writ of error, and such an
exception is unauthorized by any rule at common law or
in the Federal courts. Barnes v. Scott, 11 So. Rep. 48;

As respects the power or authority of the Board of
County Commissioners of the City and County of Denver
to issue negotiable certificates of indebtedness, see Const.,
Colorado, Art. VII, § 8; Rev. Stats., 'Colorado, 1908,
§ 2341; Sess. Laws, Colorado, 1905, p. 222.
Neither § 8 of Art. VII of the constitution of Colorado,
nor the act of 1905, authorizes the Board of County
Commissioners of the City and County of Denver to
issue negotiable certificates of indebtedness, and the
certificate and coupon sued upon, being negotiable in
form, are therefore absolutely void. Barnett v. Denison,

Even if the constitutional provision and statute in
question should be held to authorize the issuance of negotiable bonds, the security sued on in this action is not a
bond, is not negotiable, and therefore the plaintiff took
it subject to any equities existing between the county and
the payee. 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 5th ed.,

Rep. 943.
Mr. John M. Zane, with whom Mr. CharlesF. Morse and
Mr. Charles W. Waterman were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTIcE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action brought by the respondent upon a
certificate of indebtedness and an interest coupon attached
to the same, against the petitioner. There was a verdict
and judgment for the plaintiff and the Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment. 118 C. C. A. 256; 200
Fed. Rep. 28. The plaintiff held the instrument by endorsement and was found to have purchased it in good
faith before maturity, but the defendant denied the
authority to issue the certificate in negotiable form and
sought to raise the question by its third defence which
set up failure of consideration. There was a demurrer to
this defence which was sustained by the Circuit Court,
and the trial took place upon the other issues. The Circuit Court of Appeals declined to consider the correctness
of this ruling because no exception was taken to it. But

no exception or bill of exceptions is necessary to open a
question of law already apparent on the record and there
is nothing in the record that indicates a waiver of the
defendant's rights. Therefore we must consider the
merits of the defence. Nalle v. Oyster, 230 U. S. 165.
The certificate recites the allowance of a claim for ballot
machines by the Board of County Commissioners of the
City and County of Denver and goes on "the Board of
County Commissioners being authorized thereto by the
laws of the State of Colorado, Act of 1905, thereby issues
its certificate of indebtedness for the said sum, and will in
one (1) year pay to the order of the Federal Ballot Machine
Company the sum of eleven thousand two hundred and
fifty dollars, with interest on this sum, from -the date
hereof, at the rate of five per cent. per annum; the said
interest payable semi-annually, as per two (2) coupons,
hereto attached." This certificate was one of ten issued
to provide for the payment for ballot machines and the
constitution of the State authorized provision for payment in such case "by the issuance of interest-bearing
bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or other obligations,
which shall be a charge upon such city, city and county,
or town; such bonds, certificates or other obligations may
be made payable at such time or times, not exceeding
ten years from the date of issue, as may be determined, but
shall not be issued or sold at less than par." Art. VII, § 8,
as amended, November 6, 1906. A statute in like words
previously had been passed to be effective if the amendment to the constitution should be adopted as it was.
Laws of 1905, c. 101, § 6. See Rev. St. 1908, § 2342. The
defence that we are.considering is that the foregoing words
did not warrant making the certificates of indebtedness
negotiable, relying especially upon Brenham v. German
American Bank, 144 U. S. 173. But the argument seems
to us t6 need no extended answer. The power to issue
certificates of indebtiedn~ss or bonds is given in terms and

it is contemplated that these instruments may be sold to
raise money for the purpose named. But however narrowly we may construe the power of municipal corporations in this respect, when they are authorized to raisemoney by the sale of bonds we must take it that they are
authorized to put the bonds in the form that would be
almost a necessary condition to obtaining a purchaserthe usual form in which municipal bonds are put upon the
market. Gunnison County Commissioners v. Rollins, 173
U. S. 255, 276. What is true about bonds is true about
certificates of indebtedness. Indeed it is difficult to see
any distinction between the two as they are commonly
known to the business world. The essence of each is that
they contain a promise under the seal of the corporation,
to pay a certain sum to order or to bearer. We are of
opinion that the Board of County Commissioners was
authorized to issue certificates in the negotiable form.
