YOST v. DALLAS COUNTY.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 604.

Argued January 6, 1915.-Decided January 18, 1915.

The obligation of bonds issued by a county pursuant to legislative authority is an obligation under, and not paramount to, the authority
of the State.
While the District Court has jurisdiction, where diverse citizenship
exists, of a suit upon bonds issued by a county pursuant to legislative
authority, the extent of the obligation is determined by the statutes
of the State and not by the Constitution of the United States.
A plaintiff by bringing suit in the Federal court upon the contract
obligation of a county acquires no greater rights than are given by
local statutes.
The right given in bonds issued by a county pursuant to legislative
authority to have a tax levied, collected and applied to their payment, is to have such tax levied and collected in the manner provided
by statute, and courts cannot substitute their own appointee in
place of one contemplated by the act.
Even where the state court by mandamus has directed the officers of a
county to levy and collect a tax as required by the state statute and
apply it to the payment of a judgment for defaulted bonds, and
they have failed to do so, the Federal court has not jurisdiction to
appoint a commission to levy, collect and apply the tax.
Until the highest court of Missouri otherwise construes Rev. Stat.,
§ 11417, Missouri, giving the Circuit Court power to enforce by mandamus or otherwise an order of the county court to have a tax assessed, this court will not construe the words "or otherwise" as authorizing the court to collect the tax itself, but as only allowing the
resort to other means besides mandamus to compel the county court
to do so.

THE facts, which' involve the jurisdiction of the District
Court, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Harry J. Cantwell for Yost:
Federal courts are bound to proceed to judgment and

to afford redress to suitors before them in every case to
which their jurisdiction extends. They cannot abdicate
their authority or duty in any case in favor of another jurisdiction. Chicot Co. v. Sherwood, 148 U. S. 529, 534.
The means to be employed by the United States courts,
in the enforcement of their lawful jurisdiction, are limited
only by the determination of whether such means are
necessary, and agreeable to the principles and usages of
law. Section 262, Jud. Code; Hills v. Hoover, 220 U. S.

Counties and other municipal corporations, when acting
for the particular advantage of the particular corporation,
and not from considerations connected with the government of the State at large, are to be regarded as private
corporations. Murray v. Charleston, 96 U. S. 445; State
v. Gates, 190 Missouri, 540, 558; State v. County Court, 128
Missouri, 427; Lincoln Co. v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529, 531.
There is no distinction between counties and cities or
towns as regards their liability for obligations created in
their business capacity, or in the method of enforcement
of the obligations. Laramie County v. Albany County, 92

On mandamus being disobeyed the court may appoint a
receiver to do the act or acts required to be done by the
writ. Section 3012, Rev. Stat. Missouri, 1909.
The special tax imposed by the legislature of the State
of Missouri upon the property in Dallas County is a special charge, analogous to internal improvement charges.
It bears no relation to ordinary taxes for the maintenance
of local government. The creation of the debt by the
authority of the legislature, the provisions of the legislative act definitely fixing the property upon which it
should be charged, and requiring the enforcement of the
charge for the payment of the debt, created a charge

against definite specific property. Farrarv. St. Louis, 80

532; Ray Co. v. Bentley, 49 Missouri, 236; Dickason v.
County Court, 128 Missouri, 427, 438.
The charge here is a fixed, definite and certain charge
imposed by law. King v. United States, 99 U. S. 233;

United States, 103 U. S. 4 84; Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall.
175.
There being no act of discretion to be performed by
the agents of the defendant, the acts necessary to enforce
the charge against definite property being acts commanded
by the sovereign power of the State, no good reason can
be given why the same remedy should not be applied to
these agents of the county as would be applied if the county
were a private corporation.
The sovereign power of the State of Missouri has specially conferred upon the judiciary the duty of compelling
the specific performance of every act necessary to payment
of the judgment in this case. Rev. Stat. Mo. 1855, p. 427;
Vol. I, Rev. Stat. Mo. 1855, p. 438; Wagner's Mo. Stat.
1870, p. 306, see App.
The judiciary has express power to dispense with official
action of any particular individual officer in the performance of any and every act which might be necessary
to the accomplishment of payment of these bonds. Section 8, c. 47, Rev. Stat. 1855, p. 533; § 21, Art. VI, Const.,
1865; § 23, Art. VI, Const., 1875; §§ 1 and 16, c. 135, Rev.

Co., 107 Missouri, 608.
The whole question of levying taxes and of raising
revenues is, in Missouri, under the control of the judiciary.

Mr. John S. Haymes, with whom Mr. J. W. Miller was
on the brief, for Dallas County.
MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case comes here upon a Certificate from the Circuit
Court of Appeals. It is a suit in equity and the bill was
dismissed by the District Court. The facts alleged are
in short as follows. A statute of Missouri incorporated
the Laclede and Fort Scott Railroad and authorized
counties to invest in its stock and bonds and to issue
county bonds in order to pay for the same. The appellee
did so, afterwards defaulted upon its bonds and the appellant recovered judgment upon them in the same District
Court for over a millioni dollars. Under the laws in force
when the bonds were issued it was the duty of the county
officers to levy and collect annually a tax of thirty per
cent. of the amount of the bonds issued but this duty never
has been performed and the county officers evade service
of writs of mandamus or if served refuse to obey the writs.

YOST v. DALLAS COUNTY.
236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

There is no other mode of obtaining satisfaction and the
duties of levying and assessing the tax are only those of
apportioning the tax among the taxable inhabitants on
the basis of the last previous assessment which has been
made, and of collecting it. Theprayer .is for the appointment of a commissioner to levy, collect and pay over the
tax according to the Missouri law. The questions certified
are:
"1. Has a District Court of the United States, sitting
as a court of equity, jurisdiction of such a cause?
"2. When a judgment has been recovered on the law
side of a District Court of the United States of competent
jurisdiction, against a county of the State of Missouri, on
its bonds issued by authority of law, and the laws of that
State in force at the time the bonds were issued authorized
such county to levy and collect taxes to pay such bonds,
and the county has no funds in its treasury, which can be
applied to the payment of the judgment, and its property
is, under the laws of the State, exempt from seizure and
sale under execution; when the officers charged by the
laws of the State with the duty to levy and collect taxes
to pay such judgment refuse so to do, when the court in
which such judgment was rendered has a number of times
issued writs of mandamus commanding such officials to
levy the taxes which they were authorized and which it
was their duty to levy to pay such judgment, but these
officials have, when possible, evaded service of these writs,
and when served have wilfully and defiantly refused to
obey the writs of mandamus, and the fact has been conclusively demonstrated by the proceedings at law that
the plaintiff is utterly remediless at law by mandamus or
otherwise for the failure of the county to pay, and the
refusal of the officers of the county to discharge their duty
to levy and collect taxes and therewith to pay his judgment; and when the last previous assessment was made
which, by the statute in force at the time the contract

Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

was made, was authorized and made the basis of the levy
of the amount to Which the plaintiff is now entitled under
his judgment and writs of mandamus so that no act of
discretion is required to levy and collect it, but only the
clerical or ministerial acts of apportioning the amount
among the assessed values of the taxables specified in the
last previous assessment, placing it on the tax books and
collecting it of the persons and property liable therefor,
has the Federal Court of the District in which the judgment was rendered, and the futile Writs of mandamus
issued and, when possible, served, the jurisdiction and
authority in equity to appoint a commissioner, receiver
or other officer to make the apportionment and to collect
the amounts which the owner of the judgment is entitled
to have collected from the parties and properties liable
therefor."
The fundamental consideration for answering these
questions is that the obligation upon which the judgment
was recovered was an obligation under, not paramount
to, the authority of the State. It is true that the District
Court of the United States had jurisdiction of the suit
upon the contract, but the extent of the obligation imposed
was determined by the statutes of Missouri, not by the
Constitution of the United States or any extraneous
source, the Constitution only requiring that the obligation
of the Contract should not be impaired by subsequent
state law. The plaintiff by bringing suit in the United
States court acquired no greater rights than were given
to him by the local statutes. The right so given was to
have a tax levied and collected, it is true, but a tax ordained by and depending on the sovereignty of the State
and therefore limited in whatever way the State saw fit
to limit it when, so to speak, it contracted to give the remedy. It is established that 'taxes of the nature now in
question can only be levied and collected in the manner
provided' by the statute, and therefore that it is impossible

Opinion of the Court.

for the courts to substitute their own appointee in place
of the one contemplated by the act. Seibert v. Lewis, 122
U. S. 284, 298. The Missouri Case referred to in that decision states a rule that we believe always to have been
recognized in that State and others, as well as reinforced
by other decisions of this court. Kansas City v. Hannibal
& St. Joseph R. R., 81 Missouri, 285, 293. St. L. & San
Frans. Ry. v. Apperson, 97 Missouri, 300, 306. Rees v.
Watertown, 19 Wall. 107. 117. Heine v. Levee Commissioners, 19 Wall. 655, 658. Barkley v. Levee Commissioners, 93 U. S. 258, 265. Meriwether v. Garrett,102 U. S.
472, 501. Thompson v. Allen County, 115 U. S. 550; S. C.,
below, 4 Ky. Law Rep. 98, 101. The rule has other applications; e. g. Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 445.
United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 569.
It is unnecessary to repeat the strong and already often
repeated language of this court that will be found at the
pages of the repoits referred to. Some of it may go farther
than was necessary or than we should be prepared to go
in a different case, but to the extent of the principles that
we have laid down we apprehend that it is not open to
debate. It hardly could be except upon the question of
construction: how far the liability to the tax was bound
up with the mode of collection provided. But as the tax
depended for its creation upon a sovereign act of the
State and was confided for its enforcement to officers of
the State it is decided that it cannot be enforced by others.
The fact that it falls upon people who are not parties to
the contract or the suit is an additional consideration in
favor of the result; which no one would doubt if the judgment had been recovered and the present "proceeding
brought in another State. Of course it does not follow from
the fact that a court has authority to issue a writ of mandamus to compel officers to perform their duty that it can
perform that duty in their place. Authority is given by
Missouri Rev. Stat. 1909, § 11417, to the Circuit Court

to enforce 'by mandamus or otherwise' an order to the
county court to have the tax assessed, etc. But the words
'or otherwise' do not authorize the Circuit Court to collect
the tax, but only allow the resort to other means beside
mandamus to compel the county court to do so. At least
until the Supreme Court of Missouri says otherwise we
should read them in that sense.
We answer both questions: No.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.
No. 102.

Argued December 7, 8, 1914.-Decided January 18, 1915.

The courts of Oklahoma have held that under § 7 of the Original Creek
Agreement of 1901 a noD-citizen husband, while by reason of nonmembership in the tribe was not to be counted in determining the
distributive shares for the purpose of allotment to, or in the right of,
enrolled members of the tribe, was entitled under tribal laws to take
an heir's part of the lands which had been allotted to his deceased
citizen wife. De Graffenreidv. Iowa Land & Trust Co., 20 Oklahoma,
6F7.
The laws of the Creeks were uncertain and ambiguous, and although
the construction of a tribal law by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma
is not a construction of a law of the State, and this court has an undoubted right of review, it will not overturn, in a case at most only
debatable, a rule of construction that for years has governed transfers of property.
The Supplemental Creek Agreement of 1902, providing that the descent and distribution of allotments should be in accordance with
§ 49, Mansfield's Digest, Laws of Arkansas, was not an interpreta-
