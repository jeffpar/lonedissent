MUTUAL FILM CO. v. OHIO INDUS'L COMM.
236 U. S.

247

Statement of the Case.

congress of the censor board and the boards of other
States, is referred to in emphasis of complainant's objection that the statute delegates legislative power. But, as
complainant says, such congress is "at present nonexistent and nebulous," and we are, therefore, not called
upon to anticipate its action or pass upon the validity of ยง5.
We may close this topic with a quotation of the very
apt comment of the District Court upon the statute.
After remarking that the language of the statute "might
have been extended by descriptive and illustrative words,"
but doubting that it would have been the more intelligible
and that probably by being more restrictive might be
more easily thwarted, the court said: "In view of the
range of subjects which complainants claim to have already compassed, not to speak of the natural development
that will ensue, it would be next to impossible to devise
language that would be at once comprehensive and
automatic."
In conclusion we may observe that the Ohio statute
gives a review by the courts of the State of the decision
of the board of censors.
Decree affrmed.

No. 597.

Argued January 6, 7, 1915.-Decided February 23, 1915.

Mutual Film CorporAtionv. Ohio IndustrialBoard, ante, p. 230, followed
to the effect that state statutes imposing censorship on moving
pictures, such as those of Ohio and Kansas of 1913, are valid exercises
of the police power of those States, respectively, and do not interfere
with interstate commerce, abridge the liberty of opinion, or delegate
legislative power to administrative officers.
