delivered the opinion of the

court.
This case was submitted with No. 456, just decided.
In the latter case the complainant in the court below and
appellant here was a corporation of Virginia. The appellant in the pending case is a corporation of Ohio, and
counsel say "although there are some differences in the
way in which their business is conducted, yet the questions
involved are the same, the records in both cases are nearly
identical,. and the court below treafted them together,
rendering the one opinion to cover both." And counsel
have submitted them on the same argument.
On the authority, therefore, of the opinion in No. 456,
the decree is
Affirmed.

MUTUAL FILM CORPORATION OF MISSOURI v.
HODGES, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
KANSAS.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS.
No. 597.

Argued January 6, 7, 1915.-Decided February 23, 1915.

Mutual Film CorporAtionv. Ohio IndustrialBoard, ante, p. 230, followed
to the effect that state statutes imposing censorship on moving
pictures, such as those of Ohio and Kansas of 1913, are valid exercises
of the police power of those States, respectively, and do not interfere
with interstate commerce, abridge the liberty of opinion, or delegate
legislative power to administrative officers.

MUTUAL FILM CORP. v. KANSAS.
236 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

One who is not within the class specified in a state police statute as
liable to penalties for violation thereof has no standing to attack the
statute as unconstitutional.
One who simply imports moving pictures into a State and does not
exhibit them has no standing to attack a statute subjecting only
exhibitors or those permitting exhibitions to its penalties; nor can
he, by asserting constitutional rights, enlarge the character of the
statute and make it an interference with interstate commerce when
it is a mere exercise of the police power of the State upon things already within it. Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S.501, distinguished.
The fact that an exchange for moving pictures can more conveniently
subject the films to censorship than the exhibitors can, does not give
the non-exhibiting owner of an exchange a standing to attack the
statute as to matters which affect only exhibitors.

bill attacks
the validity of a law of Kansas censoring moving picture films and prays an injunction against
its enforcement. The relief was denied and the bill dismissed. This appeal was then allowed.
The bill alleges that complainant is engaged in local
and interstate commerce in the renting, leasing, selling
and delivery of "'films"' in the State of Kansas and other
States, which films have been and now are being used in
the motion picture show business in Kansas, as well as
elsewhere.
It is alleged that a film "may be a Scenario of an original
story, or theatrical production, conceived by a writer or
author. This is a sketch of a plot, or chief incidents of a
libretto or play, a drama, a prose or poetical composition,
depicting human life and conduct on a stage. It may be
also a reproduction of animated objects, scenery, picturesque views or animals, and is descriptive, educational,
instructive, as well as amusing."
The manner of the production *of a film is stated, and
that there are in the State about five hundred moving

picture theaters using the films and each theater uses
an average of three films a day.
That a revenue in the shape of a tax of $2.00 is attempted to be imposed upon each film censored, which
means a tax of $6.00 per day on the films sold, rented or
used in each show, approximating $3,000 per day on the
picture show business in the State, and making a total
revenue of $40,000 for the first three months from the
beginning of the enforcement of the act and thereafter a
revenue of thousands of dollars to be imposed as a tax
upon films printed and produced in Kansas.
That the act places a tax of about $300 a week on the
films rented, hired and shipped into the State for the period
of .three months and about $6,000 for the first year and
means thereafter a tax on the interstate commerce business of complainant, a similar tax to be imposed on all
films produced and printed and sent into Kansas.
That upon the films brought into the State the duty
of censorship is imposed upon the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, thereby attempting to place in
him the exclusive power of censorship of all films sent
into the State for use in the State and the power to review
and stamp with his approval the films used, shipped or
rented or sent into the State; and the act provides that
no film shall be exempt until a fee of $2.00 be paid and
that all fees shall be paid into the state treasury and
credited to the general fund of the State. That on account of the way the business is conducted, complainant
and other film exchanges must necessarily bear the expense of censorship, otherwise the amount of the charges
therefor would be necessarily doubled or trebled.
The bill attacks the law for various reasons, having
foundation, it is alleged, in the provisions of the Federal
and state Constitutions, which may be summarized as
follows: The prohibition upon the State to lay an import
or export duty; or to abridge the privileges and immunities

MUTUAL FILM CORP. v. KANSAS.

Statement of the Case.

of citizens of the United States, the statute of the State
offending in this as it places an embargo and prohibition
upon citizens of other States in transacting a lawful business in Kansas. The statute violates the bill of rights of
the United States and of the State of Kansas as it deprives
of life, liberty and property without due process of law,
and particularly of the freedom to say, write, or publish
whatever one will on any subject, "being only responsible
for all abuse of that liberty," and that there can be no
abuse until it is judiciaily determined.
It is alleged that the Attorney General of the State
threatens to enforce the act, although it seems to be
charged that he is without the means to do so, and arrests
have been made on information filed in one of the courts
of the State.
The answer of defendants asserts in elaborate allegations the necessity of the act and of the censorship of
films; that it is not primarily a revenue measure but is
an exercise in good faith of the police power of the State
for the protection of the public inorals and that "the
Legislature in its unimpeachable wisdom believed that
uncensored pictures were detrimental to the morals and
perversive of true education." In denial of any grievaiice
of complainant under the act the answer alleges the following: "Answering still further defendants allege that
this complainant has no interest in the act of the Kansas
Legislature complained of nor does the complainant exhibit pictures to the people of Kansas in moving picture
shows, or elsewhere, nor does the complainant come directly under the provisions of said act, nor can the complainant, as a Delaware corporation licensed to do business
in the State of Missouri, transact interstate business
within the State of Kansas either with or without the
payment of an inspection fee under the act complained
of, nor is the complainant liable to any criminal prosecution under the act complained of, but only the persons,

firms, partnerships, companies and corporations which
actually do exhibit pictures uncensored within the State
of Kansas in violation of the act. And defendants further
allege that upon its own showing this complainant has
brought only mere moot questions into this Honorable
Court."
A hearing upon an interlocutory or temporary injunction was waived and the case heard upon its merits, one
judge only sitting, the parties agreeing thereto.
Affidavits in support of the bill were filed. One of them
was by an exhibitor of films within the State and showed
the number of theaters owned by him, the number of
films received by him and the price paid therefor and that
they were manufactured elsewhere than in Kansas. It
affirmed that he never exhibited nor has he ever seen exhibited indecent, immoral, obscene or sacrilegious pictures or films; that among the films exhibited by him is
a film.known as the "Mutual Weekly," which consists
of photographs of events of current interest throughout
the world. A list of the subjects represented is given.
An affidavit of odie of the managers of the complainant
was also filed giving an account of the production of the
films and their distribution. After a detail of this by
,complainant and by other "film exchanges" renting out
films in the State and which operate independently of
complainant, it is said:
"In my opinion the only possible method of continuing.
the rental of film in the State of Kansas, if the proposed
censorship law were to go into effect, would be for the
film exchanges to procure the approval required by statute.
There are a large number of motion picture exhibitors in
the State of Kansas,-about five hundred (500). I do
not believe it would be in any wise practicable for the
exhibitors themselves to procure the approval of the different films. In the first place, the same subjects are
rented from different film exchanges and are shown in

MUTUAL FILM CORP. v. KANSAS.

Argument for Appellees.

different theaters concurrently. No exhibitor would be
in a position to know whether the subject had been approved or not, without submitting the same to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The result would be
that in almost every case each reel of film'received by an
exhibitor on rental for exhibit would have to be sent to
Topeka for approval, because the exhibitor would not,
at his peril, exhibit the same.
"The film exchange, on the other hand, could with
less difficulty than the exhibitor ascertain whether a
film had been approved or not, because the film exchange
itself handles large quantities of films, and at least as to
its own produce could keep track of the approval or nonapproval thereof, 'therefore, making it absolutely necessary for this complainant, or the other film exchanges, to
submit before renting out their films to their patrons in
Kansas the films for approval.
"In the second place, in my opinion, no exhibitor
would consent to pay the censoring charge on any particular reel, or reels of film, because he would insist that the
film be rented out to some other exhibitor in Kansas before him so that some one else should pay the tax."

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA,

after stating the case as above,

delivered the opinion of the court.
Necessarily the first factor to be considered is the law
of the State. It is entitled "An Act regulating the exhibiting or using of moving picture films or reels; providing
and regulating the examination and approval of moving
picture films and reels, and fixing penalties for the violation of this act, and making an appropriation for clerical
help to carry this act into effect."
The following are its provisions: On and after April 1,
1913, it shall be unlawful to exhibit or use any moving
picture film or reel unless the same shall have been ex-

MUTUAL FILM CORP. v. KANSAS.

Opinion of the Court.

amined and approved by the Superintendent of Public
Instruction. Films used in institutions of learning are
exempt from the provisions of the act. It is made the
duty of such officer to examine the films or reels intended
for exhibition and approve such as he shall find to be
moral and instructive and to withhold his approval from
such as tend to debase or corrupt the morals. His approval
is to be stamped in writing upon the films or reels approved. He is to keep a record of examinations made by
him, noting those approved and those not approved, stating, the reasons for the latter. A charge of $2.00 is to be
made for each examination He is given the power and
authority to supervise and regulate the display of all
moving picture films or reels in all places of amusement or
elsewhere'within the State, to inquire and investigate, and
to have displayed for his benefit to aid 'him in his investigation,' those which are intended to be displayed, and shall
approve such as shall be moral and proper and disapprove
such as are sacrilegious, obscene, indecent or immoral, or
such as tend to corrupt the morals. His disapproval of
any film or reel may be reviewed by a commission consisting of the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary
of State, and if they or a majority of them find the film or
reel fit for exhibition it shall be approved. It is the duty
of every person exhibiting or permitting to be exhibited
any film or reel within the State to furnish the Superintendent of Instruction, if he require it, a description of
such film or reel and a description of its scenes and purposes and to exhibit and display it for his examination and
approval. Any person exhibiting or permitting to be exhibited any unapproved- film or reel shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor; and each liable to suit and separate fines.
It will be observed that the law makes only exhibitors
or those permittingexhibitions of unapproved films liable
to the penalties of the act, and, as we have seen, it is alleged by the defendants that as complainant is in neither

236 U. S.

class, it has no standing to attack the statute. To this
complainant replies that its sales are interfered with, and
invokes, as sustaining its right to complain, Savage v.
Jones, 225 U. S. 501. This may be; but complainant, by
asserting such right, cannot enlarge the character of the
statute or give to it an operation which it does not have,cannot, for instance, make the importation of films into
the State an offense under it, and not their exhibition,
which only it punishes-cannot, therefore, make the act
an interference with interstate commerce instead of what
it is-an exercise of the police power of the State upon
things within the State. Nor can it make any difference
that the "exchanges can more conveniently submit the
films for approval than exhibitors can."
The opinion in No. 456 becomes applicable here. Indeed, this case was argued conjointly with that and submitted on the same briefs. It is here contended that the
Kansas statute has the same invalidity and for the same
reasons as it was contended there that the statute of Ohio
had. We need not, therefore, repeat the reasoning. It
establishes that both statutes are valid exercises of the
police power of the States and are not amenable to the
objections urged against them-that is, do not interfere
with interstate commerce nor abridge the liberty of opinion; nor are they delegations of legislative power to administrative officers.
Decree affirmed.
