right secured by statute under the Constitution.
This conclusion is fatal to the order and warrant of removal and requires a reversal of the judgment below and the

HALTER v. NEBRASKA.
ElRROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA.
No. 174.

Submitted Jauary 23, 1907.-Decided March 4, 1907.

classification and is not arbitrary.
The statute. of Nebraska -preventing and punishing the desecration of the
flag of the United States and prohibiting the sale of articles upon which
there is a representation of the flag for advertising purposes is not un-
