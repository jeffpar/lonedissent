to fix extra compensation to be paid customs officials at the expense of the licensees for Sunday and holiday service in such lading

Statement of the Case.

Stat. 402, by which the extra compensation was extended to cover
overtime " in connection with the unlading, receiving, or examination of passengers' baggage," this provision being given full effect
if confined to baggage of passengers on vessels for the immediate
lading or unlading of whose cargoes special license may issue under
the original act. P. 512.
2. A company owning and operating a toll bridge, with a line of
trolley cars, across the Niagara River, over which was heavy passenger travel in the cars, in other vehicles and on foot, and as to
which customs inspection service had been maintained by the
United States, as well on Sundays and holidays, when the travel
was heaviest, as on week days, was notified that unless it procured
a special license under the -above amended act, which would
necessitate its agreeing to pay the amount of extra compensation
for customs officials and giving a bond to indemnify the United
States against all losses arising from the granting of the license,
no vehicle, except the cars, would be permitted to enter the United
States on Sundays and holidays, and no passengers, except after
surrender of all personal baggage,, including handbags, to a customs guard, and that all vehicles except tibe cars, and all baggage
surrendered, would be held by the collector at the owner's risk for
examination on the following working day. Held: (a) That the
instruction of the Secretary of the Treasury to this effect could
not be sustained as a discretionary determination that the movement of merchandise at the place did not justify maintaining customs service on the days in question. P. 514. (b) That it was not
a valid regulation under Rev. Stats., ยง 161, but was both unreasonable and inconsistent with law, virtually laying a tax and providing
for extra compensation of officials from a private source contrary
to statute. P. 514. (c) That the bridge owner, as well as passengers and vehicle owners, had a standing to question the regulation. P. 515.

MR. JusTIcE B

wDEis delivered the opinion of the

court.
The International Railway Company owns and operates two public toll-bridges across the Niagara River between the United States and Canada. One is at Niagara
Falls, the other at Lewiston, a short distance below.
Over each bridge the company operates regularly its passenger cars; and over each there is heavy passenger travel
also in other vehicles and on foot. For more than twenty
years prior to June, 1920, the Government had, at its om
expense, maintained at the American end of these bridges
customs inspectors, continuously day and night, including Sundays and holidays. Then the Collector of Customs of the Port of Buffalo notified the company that on
Sundays and holidays thereafter no vehicle (except trolley
cars) would be permitted to enter the United States;
that no passenger would be allowed to enter except after
surrender to the customs guard of all personal baggage,
even the smallest handbag; and that all vehicles (except
trolley cars) and all baggage surrendered would be-held
by the Collector, at the owner's risk, for examination on
the next following working day. The company was further advised that continued service of customs inspectors
on Sundays and holidays could be secured, if it would
make application for a special license under the Act of
February 13, 1911, c. 46, 36 Stat. 899, as amended by the
Act of February 7, 1920, c. 61, 41 Stat. 402. Day and
night customs service on ordinary week days was to be
continued at the expense of the Government as thereto-

Opinion of the Court.

fore. The Collector acted throughout under instructions
of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The Act of 1911, entitled "An Act To provide for the
lading or unlading of vessels at night ", etc., declares that
immediate lading or unlading of any vessel or other conveyance can be had upon the obtaining by "master,
owner, agent, or consignee" of a special license therefor.
To obtain the license it is necessary that the applicant
shall agree to pay to the Collector of Customs an amount
equal to the extra compensation of the customs officers
employed therefor at night or on Sundays or holidays, and,
shall give a bond conditioned to indemnify the United
States against all losses which arise from granting the
license. The compensation payable for overtime, including services on Sundays and holidays, was fixed by the
Secretary of the Treasury at double the day rate; and the
amount of the bond for a six months' license is fixed by
the statute at fifty thousand dollars. The amendment of
1920 provides, among other things, that the work for
which extra compensation is payable by the licensee shall
include that of examining "passengers' baggage." The
company does not unlade any cargo at night or on Sundays or holidays, and does not contemplate doing so. It
is interested only iii preserving the passenger traffic passing over its bridges. This traffic on working days is not
nearly as heavy as on Sundays and holidays. Discontinuance of the customs service on those days would, in large
measure, destroy that traffic.
The company brought this suit in the Federal District
Court for Western New York against the Collector to
enjoin the threatened action, insisting that the provisions
of these statutes are not applicable to a toll-bridge and
that the Collector is without power to exact, as a condition of continuing the service, that the company take a
license with the attendant burdens. The District Court

dismissed the bill for want of equity, 271 Fed. 313; and
its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
273 Fed. 153. The case was brought here by appeal; and
a petition for a writ of certiorari was also filed, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the
merits. Whether the action taken and threatened ecceeds
the powers conferred by l1w is the main question presented.
The Act of 1911 contained no reference whatsoever to
passengers or to their baggage or personal effects. It
dealt exclusively with the grant of special permits for the
immediate lading or unlading of vessels and other conveyances. It consists of five sections and a repealing clause.
The first four prescribe the conditions under which such
license shall issue and the proceedings to be taken thereunder. The fifth section gives the Secretary of the Treasury power to fix extra compensation to be paid customs
officials serving at night, on Sundays or on holidays in connection with lading or unlading under such special permit;
and it provides that an amount equal to the extra compensation shall be paid to the Collector by the licensee.
The amendatory Act of February 7, 1920, made no change
whatsoever in the first four sections of the Act of 1911.
It dealt solely with the extra compensation, merely
substituting the new ยง 5, shown in the margin.1 This

this work it includes that "in connection with the unlading, receiving, or examination of passengers' baggage."
The contention of the Government is that the mere insertion of these words in ยง5 has the effect of establishing a system of special licenses applicable to toll-bridges which are
not vessels or other conveyances, and on which there is
neither cargo, lading or unlading, but passengers who pass
on foot or in trolleys or automobiles.
The contention is at variance with the language of the
act and with its history. Obviously the words "vessel or
other conveyance" are not. appropriate to describe the
plant of a toll-bridge. Other provisions, also, of the Act
of 1911, like the requirement of "entry of vessels, and
due report of other conveyances" before issue of the
special license, show that it was not the purpose of Congress to make it applicable to the conduct of a toll-bridge
or the operation thereon of a line of passenger trolley cars.
The clause in the amendment of 1920 by which the extra
compensation payable under ยง5 is extended to-cover overtime "in connection with the unlading, receiving, or examination of passengers' baggage " is given full effect, if
applied to the baggage of passengers on those vessels for
the immediate lading and unlading of whose cargoes
special license may issue under the first four sections of
the Act of 1911. That these were the only overtime services in connection with passengers for which the amendment made provision is confirmed by its history. The
injustice of denying to customs officials compensation for
such overtime services was obvious. But the Secretary
of the Treasury had been advised, after the passage of
the Act of 1911, as well as before, that he was without
power to make-or to require the vessel owner to makeany payment therefor, since passengers' baggage is not
"cargo ", 30 Ops. Atty. Gen. 123. To remedy this and
other defects in the provision for extra pay, the amendinent was introduced at the. instance of the Treasury De-

partment, with the approval of the United States Shipping Board and of the American Steamship Association.'
Congress created two distinct systems for the examination of articles coming from foreign countries. One dealt
with articles imported as merchandise; the other with
passengers' baggage and personal effects. That distinction, established by the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat.
627, has b5een preserved in all later legislation. One Pearl
Chain v. United States, 123 Fed. 371, 374. For merchandise there are elaborate provisions concerning entry,
manifests, unloading, invoices, consular certificates and
bills of lading. Revised Statutes, ยงยง 2581, 2867, 2962 and
2872, as amended by Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, ยง 25,
23 Stat. 53, 59. There are special provisions affecting importations from Canada and Mexico. Revised Statutes,
ยงยง 3097, 3098,3099. Compliance with these requirements
necessarily involves delays. Concerning passengers' baggage and effects the provisions are much simpler. They
are designed to secure expeditious entry. Revised Statutes, ยงยง 2799, 2800, 2801 and 2802, deal with articles from
foreign ports. There are additional provisions concerning

vessels at night, for which the Government employees were paid in
some such manner a is prescribed in this measure. But a year or
two ago the Attorney General held that men could not be paid for
passing upon the baggage taken off ships at night, but could be paid
for supervising the discharging of the cargoes. That caused some
difficulty, because we found a customs official examining baggage at
night and being unpaid for it, and right alongside of him a customs
official examining cargo and being paid for that." 59 Cong. Rec.,

articles coming from contiguous countries. Revised Statutes, ยงยง 3100, 3101, 3102. That Congress intended by the
Act of 1920 to abandon this distinction between merchandise and passengers' baggage which had been carefully preserved in the Act of 1911, is not to be assumed.
It is also insisted that the Secretary of the Treasury has
authority, independently of the power specially conferred
by the Act of 1911 as amended, to issue the instruction
complained of. The contention is that his instruction to
the Collector was not to compel the bridge company to
pay the cost of the inspection service but merely to withdraw the service unless the company would agree to pay
the cost; that since customs officials cannot be maintained
at every point where merchandise may conceivably enter
from contiguous countries, discretion must rest in the
Secretary to determine whether the character and extent
of the movement at a particular place justifies maintaining them there; and that the instruction given was a
regulation under ยง 161 of the Revised Statutes which had
the force of law. Haasv. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462,480. To
this contention it is perhaps a sufficient answer to say
that the instruction given was obviously not a determination by the Secretary that the travel over these bridges
on Sundays and holidays was not such as to justify the
Government in maintaining the inspection service. The
travel was heavier on those days than on any other; and
the service had been. maintained continuously for more
than twenty years. But there are other conclusive answers. Section 161 does not confer upon the Secretary
any legislative power. Morrill v. Jones, 106 U. S. 466;
United States v. George, 228 U. S. 14. A regulation to be
valid must be reasonable and must be consistent with law.
The instruction given lacks both of these essentials. To
collect the cost of customs service from vessel owners or
others is virtually laying a tax upon them. This cannot
be done except by specific authorization of Congress.

INTERNATIONAL RY. CO. v. DAVIDSON. 515

Opinion of the Court.

Moreover, unless so authorized, no official or employee
may receive from the Government pay for extra services.
Revised Statutes, ยง 1764; United States v. Garlinger,169
U. S. 316. Nor may he receive in connection with his services pay from any private source, Act of March 3, 1917,
c. 163, ยง 1, 39 Stat. 1106. Customs officials especially are
forbidden to receive such payment. Revised Statutes,
ยง 1790. Furthermore, to impose upon the company the
obligation of furnishing an indemnity bond covering losses
which may accrue to the Government from the action, not
of the bridge company or of its employees, but of any
passenger who crosses the bridge was clearly unreasonable. It was this.lack of power in the Secretary to impose upon others any part of the cost of the customs
service unless specially authorized by Congress which
led to the enactment also of the earlier legislation concerning special licenses for lading and unlading of
cargoes.1 The instructions here attacked profess to rest,
not upon Revised Statutes, ยง 161, but upon the Act of
1911 as amended by that of 1920, T. D. 38290; T. D.
38429. The claim of such authority by virtue of the
power to establish regulations for the Department was
apparently first made in this suit.
It is further contended that the petitioner has no standing to question the regulation which applies not to it,
but to the owners of private conveyances and of personal
baggage brought over the bridge. While these also might
be entitled to seek redress, it is clear that the instructions
given threaten vital interests of the bridge company to
which a court of equity should afford protection. The
