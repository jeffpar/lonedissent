UNITED STATES v. MILLE LAC BAND OF CHIP-PEWA INDIANS IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.
APPEAL

No. 736.

FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

Argued April 8, 9, 1913.-Decided June 9, 1913.

When Congress passed the act of January 14, 1889, adjusting relations
with the Mille Lac Chippewas a real controversy was subsisting
which was thereby adjusted and composed, and the act is to be
construed according to its plain and unambiguous terms.
Indians, no less than the United States, are bound by the plain import
of the language of an act of Congress and an agreement conferring
substantial benefits on them.
Under the act of January 14, 1889, the Mille Lac Chippewas received
substantial benefits in consideration whereof they released their
claims to lands in the Red Lake Reservation upon which there were
valid premiption and homestead entries, and the United States is
not bound to account to them for the proceeds'of sale of such lands;
but, as to the other lands, the United States held them in trust for
the Mille Lac Chippewas who are entitled to damages under the
act on the basis of the value of such lands in 1889.
In interpreting a proviso in a statute, it will not be given a meaning
that would amount to entirely rejecting it.
In a contract with Indians, such as that embodied'in the act of January 14, 1889, a reference to regular and valid pre~mption and
homestead entries of land within a reservation would include all that
were not fraudulent and would not exclude all entries on the ground
of invalidity because made on lands within an Indian reservation.
47 Ct. Cl. 415, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and interpretation of the various treaties, agreements and statutes
relating to the Mille Lac Reservation, are stated in the
opinion.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This suit was begun under the act of February 15, 1909,
35 Stat. 619, c. 126, which authorized the Court of Claims
"to hear and determine a suit or suits to be brought by and
on behalf of the Mille Lac Band of Chippewa Indians in
the State of Minnesota against the United States on account of losses sustained by them or the Chippewas of
Minnesota by reason of the opening of the Mille Lac
Reservation

to public settlement under the gen-

eral land laws of the United States.'
The lands to which the act and the suit relate are four
fractional townships bordering on the Mille Lac in Minnesota, and three islands in that lake, comprising in all a
little more than 61,000 acres. The suit was begun in the
name of the Mille Lac Band, and the Court of Claims,
two judges dissenting, gave judgment against the United
States in the sum of $827,580.72, with a direction, in substance, that the amount recovered be credited to the
Chippewas of Minmesota and distributed among them
under the provisions of ยง 7 of the act of January 14, 1889,
25 Stat. 642, c. 24. 47 Ct. Cl. 415. The case is here upon
the appeal of the United States.
The judgment was sought and was rendered on the
theory that the lands-were set apart and reserved for the
occupancy and use of the Mille Lac Band by treaties of
February 22, 1855, 10 Stat. 1165; March 11, 1863, 12
Stat. 1249, and May 7, 1864, 13 Stat. 693, and were subsequently relinquished to the United States pursuant to
the act of January 14, 1889, supra, upon certain trusts
therein named, and that in violation of those treaties and

that act they were opened to settlement and disposal
under the general land laws of the United States and were
disposed of thereunder, to the great loss and damage of the
Mille Lac Band of the Chippewas of Minnesota.
The arguments at the bar and in the briefs
are addressed to these questions: 1. The scope of the jurisdictional act. 2. The rights of the Indians in the lands under
the treaties of 18,63 and 1864. 3. The effect to be given
to the act of 1889 and its acceptance by the Indians.
4. Whether the disposal of the lands, or any of them, under
the general land laws was violative of the rights of the
Indians.
The jurisdictional act makes no admission of liability,
or of any ground of liability, on the part of the Government, but merely provides a forum for the adjudication
of the claim according to applicable legal principles. Nor
does it contemplate that recovery may be founded upon
any merely moral obligation, not expressed in pertinent
treaties or statutes, or upon any interpretation of either
that fails to give effect to their plain import, because -of
any supposed injustice to the Indians. United States v.
Old Settlers, 148 U. S.427, 469; United States v. Choctaw &c.
Nations, 179 U. S. 494, 735; Sac and Fox Indians, 220
U. S.481, 489.
Under the treaty of 1855, supra, there were reserved for
the occupancy and use of the Mississippi bands of Chippewas, of which the Mille Lac Band was one, six separate
tracts of land in Minnesota. One of these embraced the
townships and islands before mentioned, and came to be
separately occupied by the Mille Lacs, although all the
reservations were claimed in common by all the bands.
By the treaty of 1863, supra, the lands in the six reservations, the one occupied by the Mille Lacs being-in terms
included, were expressly ceded to the United States
(Art. I), and one large tract of other lands in Minnesota
was reserved for the future home of all the bands;including

Opinion of the Court.

the Mille Lacs (Art. II). Provision was made (Art. IV)
for clearing and breaking a limited area in the new reservation for each of the bands, the Mille Lacs being in terms
included, and (Art. VI) for removing the agency and saw
mill from one of the ceded reservations to the new. Article XII of this treaty was as follows,-special importance
being now attached to its proviso (p. 1251):
"It shall not be obligatory upon the Indians, parties to
this treaty, to remove from their present reservations,
until the United States shall have first complied with the
stipulations of Articles IV. and VI. of this treaty, when
the United States shall furnish them with all necessary
transportation and subsistence to their new homes, and
subsistence for six months thereafter: Provided, That,
owing to the heretofore good con tuct of the Mille Lac
Indians, they shall not be compelled to remove so long as
they shall not in any way interfere with or in any manner
molest the persons or property of the whites."
The treaty of 1864, supra, superseded that of 1863, and
in so far as their provisions are material here they were
identical, so we shall speak only of the later one. In addition to the creation of the single large reservation, proviion was made for the payment of large annuities to the
Indians in consideration for the cession of the six original
reservations, and it is not questioned that these annuities
were duly paid to all the bands, including the Mille Lacs,
nor that there was a full compliance with Articles IV and
VI.
A treaty negotiated in 1867, 16 Stat. 719, eliminated a
considerable "portion of the large tract reserved by Article II of the treaty of 1864 and substituted a new tract,
consisting of thirty-six townships, which came to be known
as the White Earth Reservation. This treaty is not important here, save as it explains subsequent references to
the White Earth Reservation.
A controversy soon arose over the meaning and effect

229 U. S.

of the proviso to Article XII of the treaty of 1864 declaring, "that, owing to the heretofore good conduct of the
Mille Lac Indians, they shall not be compelled to remove
[from the old reservation to the new one] so long as they
shall not in any way interfere with or in any manner
molest the persons or property of the whites." On the
part of the executive and administrative officers it was
insisted-not, however, without some differences among
themselves-that the proviso did not invest the Mille Lacs
with any right in the old reservation expressly ceded by
Article I of the treaty, but merely permitted them to remain thereon as a matter of favor; that one purpose of the
cession was to enable the Govermnent to survey the lands
and open them to settlement, and that it was not intended
that the permission to remain should interfere with this.
But the Mille Lacs maintained that the proviso operated
to reserve the lands for their occupancy and use indefinitely, and that the lands could not be opened to settlement while they remained and conducted themselves
properly towards the whites in that vicinity. The survey
was made, the lands were declared open to settlement and
entry, and entries in considerable numbers were allowted
from time to time; but the Mille Lacs persisted in their
claim and refused to move, although repeatedly entreated
to do so. This continued to be the situation until the act
of 1889 was passed by Congress and accepted by the Mille
Lacs and other Chippewas of Minnesota. In the meantime an order was issued by one Secretary of the Interior
-uspendingthe allowance of further entries, as also further
action upon those already allowed, and this order was
recalled by a succeeding Secretary. Congress then passed
the act of July 4, 1884, 23 Stat. 76, 89, c. 180, directing
that the lands should not "be patented or disposed of in
any manner until further legislation." The entries allowed
up to that time covered about 55,000 acres, or approximately nine-tenths of the lands, and some were under

investigation upon charges that they were fraudulent.
After the passage of the act of 1884, all further action was
suspended awaiting further legislation.
That legislation came in the act of 1889. It provided
for a commission to negotiate with all the bands of Chippewas in Minnesota for the cession and relinquishment of
all their reservations, excepting the White Earth and Red
Lake Reservations, and for the cession and relinquishment
of so much of them as should not be required for allotments. It further provided that the cession and relinquishment should be obtained as to each reservation,
other than the Red Lake, through the assent in writing of
two-thirds of the male adults of the band "occupying and
belonging to" it, and, as to the Red Lake Reservation,
through a like assent of two-thirds of the male adults of
all the Chippewas in the State; that the cession and relinquishment as to each reservation should be subject to
the approval of the President, and when approved should
operate as a complete extinguishment of the Indian title
"for the purposes and upon the terms" stated in the act;
that thereupon all the Chippewas in the State, excepting
those on the Red Lake Reservation, should be removed to
and take up their residence on the White Earth Reservation and receive allotments in severalty therein, and allotments to those on the Red Lake Reservation should be
made in that reservation; that any Indian residing on any
of said reservations might, in his discretion, take his allotment "on the reservation where he lives

of being removed;" that the ceded lands not so allotted
should be classified as "pine lands" and as "agricultural
lands" and be disposed of in the manner, and at the prices
stated in the act; and (ยง 7) that all moneys accruing from
their disposal, after deducting expenses, should be placed
in the treasury of the United States to the credit of all
the Chippewas of Minnesota as a trust fund, drawing interest at five per cent. per annum, the interest to be used

for their benefit and the principal to be distributed among
them at the end of fifty years. In ยง 6 there was a proviso,
deemed important here, declaring "That nothing in this
act shall be held to authorize the sale or other disposal
under its provision of any tract upon which there is a subsisting, valid, premption or homestead entry, but any
such entry shall be proceeded with under the regulations
and decisions in force at the time of its allowance, and if
found regular and valid, patentsshall issue thereon."
Through negotiations conducted under the authority of
that act, the commissioners secured agreements with the
Indians embodying the contemplated cessions and relin(ttiishments, and these, upon submission to the President,
were approved by him March 4, 1890. The agreement
with the Mille Lacs, in addition to embodying a cession
and relinquishment of the lands in' the White Earth and
Red Lake Reservations not required for allotments, contained an express assent to all the provisions of the'act of
1889 and an express relinquishment of the lands in the
Mille Lac Reservation, as is shown by the following excerpt
from the agreement:
"We, the undersigned, being male adult Indians over
eighteen years of age of the Mille Lac Band of Chippewas
of the Mississippi, occupying and belonging to the Mille
Lac Reservation under and by virtue of a clause in the
twelfth article of the treaty of May 7, 1864 (13 Stat.,
p. 693), do hereby certify and declare that we have heard
read, interpreted and thoroughly explained to our understanding the act of Congress, approved January 14, 1889,
entitled 'An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota' (Public, No. 13),
which said act is embodied in the foregoing instrument,
and after such explanation and understanding, have consented and agreed to said act, and have accepted and
ratified the same, and-do hereby accept and consent to and
ratify the said act, and each and all of the provisions

thereof, . . . and we do also hereby forever relinquish to the United States the right of occupancy on the
Mille Lac Reservation, reserved to us by the twelfth
article of the treaty of May 7, 1864."
This agreement was negotiated at a council of the
Mille Lacs, wherein they reiterated their claim under Article XII and at first declined to assent to the act of 1889,
but upon further consideration assented and then signed
the agreement. The commission, in reporting the result of
its labors, gave a tabulated statement of the reservations,
with the area of each, covered by the relinquishments,
and included the Mille Lac Reservation, with an area of
61,014 acres, in the statement. In submitting the agreements, including that with the Mille Lacs, to the President,
with the recommendation that each be separately approved, as was done, the Secretary of the Interior referred
to the prolonged controversy with the Mille Lacs and
said: "The rights of the Indians upon this reservation
have been a vexed question, full of difficulties and embarrassments, bu't it is hoped that this agreement will
furnish a basis for its early and final solution." Upon approving the agreements (they were sometimes spoken of
as constituting in the aggregate a single document) the
President transmitted a copy of them and of the accompanying papers to Congress for its information, and in the
letter of transmittal said: "Being satisfied from an examination of the papers submitted that the cession and relinquishment by said Chippewa Indians of their title and
interest in the lands specified and described in the agreement with the different bands or tribes of Chippewa
Indians in the State of Minnesota was obtained in the
manner prescribed in the first section of said act, and that
more than the requisite number have signed said agreement, I have, as provided by said act, approved the said
instruments in writing constituting the agreement entered
into by the cormissioners with said Indians." Shortly

thereafter, and before the Mille Lacs removed from the
old reservation, Congress passed the act of July 22, 1890,
26 Stat. 290, c. 714, whereby a railroad right of way, including station grounds, was granted through that reservation upon condition that compensation therefor be paid
to the United States for the use of the Indians and that a
failure to use the right of way and station grounds for railroad purposes should inure to the benefit of the Indians,
thereby recognizing that the Indians had then come to
have an interest in the disposal of the lands.
After the Mille Lacs gave their assent to the act of 1889
the entries theretofore allowed were examined and passed
upon by the Land. Department in regular course and such
as were found to be regular and bona fide were passed to
patent. The remaining lands in the reservation were
subsequently disposed, of, not under the act of 1889, but
under the general land laws, in pursuance of directions
contained in the joint resolutions of December 19, 1893,
28 Stat. 576, and May 27, 1898, 30 Stat. 745.
Whatever might be said of its merits, it is apparent that
there was a real controversy between the Mille Lacs and
the Government in respect of the rights of the former
under Article XII of the treaty of 1864, and that the
controversy was still subsisting when the act of 1889 was
passed by Congress and assented 'to by the Indians.
And we think it also is apparent that this controversy was
intended to be and was thereby adjusted and composed.
A manifest purpose of the act was to bring about the
removal to the White Earth Reservation of all the scat-.
tered bands, residing elsewhere than on the Red Lake
Rieservation, the Mille Lacs as well as the others; and this
was to be accomplished, not through the exertion of the
p)lenary power of Congress, but through negotiations ith
and the assent of the Indians. The provision in ยง 6 for
perfecting subsisting preemption and homestead entries,
if found regular and valid, pointed most persuasively to a

UNITED STATES v. MIL. LAC CHIPPEWAS.

507

Opinion of the Court.

purpose to extend the negotiations to the Mille Lac
Reservation. The commission, the Secretary of the Interior, and the President, in seeking, obtaining and approving the relinquishment of that reservation, all treated it as
within the purview of the act, and the Mille Lacs did the
same. Then, too, Congress recognized by the act of 1890,
shortly following the approval of the agreement, that the
Indians had come to have an interest in the disposal of the
lands in that reservation.
But while the Government thus waived its earlier position respecting the status of the reservation and consented
to recognize the contention of the Indians, this was done
upon the express condition, stated in the proviso to ยง 6,
"That nothing in this act shall be held to authorize the
sale or other disposal under its provisions of any tract
upon which there is a subsisting, valid premption or
homestead entry, but any such entry shall be proceeded
with under the regulations and decisions in force at the
time of its allowance, and if found regular and valid, patent
shall issue thereon." In other words, the controversy was
intended to be and was adjusted and composed by concessions on both sides, whereby the lands in the Mille
Lac Reservation were put in the same category, and were
to be disposed of for the benefit of the Indians in the same
manner, as the lands in the other reservations relinquished
under the act, but subject to the condition and qualification that all subsisting bona fide preemption and homestead entries should be carried to completion and patent
under the regulations and decisions in force at the time of
their allowance.
True, it is said on behalf of the Indians that they did not
so understand the act, that is, did not understand that
existing entries could be thus carried to patent. But of
this it is enough to observe that the language of the proviso
to ยง 6 is plain and unambiguous; that the agreement recites
that the Mille Lacs "do hercby accept and consent to and

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

ratify the said act,, and each and all of the provisions
thereof;" and that the Indians, no less that the United
States, are bound by the plain import of the language of
the act and the agreement. Not only so, but the act
conferred upon the Mille Lacs many very substantial
advantages which doubtless constituted the inducement
to the adjustment and composition to which they assented.
Among other advantages; it enabled them to share in
the proceeds of the disposal of a vast acreage of lands in
which they otherwise would have had no interest.
On behalf of the Indians it also is said that the proviso
was limited to "regular and valid" preemption and homestead entries, and that no entry of lands within an Indian
reservation could come within that limitation. But this
assumes the existence of the Mille Lac Reservation at the
time of the entries, which was the very matter in dispute.
Besides, the interpretation suggested could not be accepted without wholly rejecting the proviso, for if it was
inapplicable to entries in the Mille Lac tract, it was
equally inapplicable to any in the other tracts relinquished
under the act. In saying this we do not indicate that
there were other entries, for the reports of the Land and
Indian Offices, which were before Congress when the act
of 1889 was passed, disclosed the entries in the Mille Lac
tract and did not show any others. Of course, the proviso
cannot be rejected. It had an office to perform and must
be given effect., It meant, as its terms plainly show, that
entries made in accordance with existing regulations and
decisions could, if bona fide, be carried to completion
and patent in the usual way; and the phrase "if found
regular and valid" was evidently used with special
reference to the charge that some of the entries were
fraudulent and with the purpose of eliminating such as
were of that character.
We are accordingly of opinion that the act of 1889, to
which the Indians fully assented, contemplated and

UNITED STATES v. MIL. LAC CHIIPPEWAS.

509

Opinion of the Court.

authorized the completion, and the issuing of patents on,
all existing preemption and homestead entries in the Mille
Lac tract which in the course of proceedings in the Land
Department should be found to be within the terms of
the proviso to ยง 6, and therefore that no rights of the
Indians were infringed in so disposing of lands embraced
in such entries. And we think the evident purpose of the
proviso requires that it be held to include entries of that
class theretofore passed to patent, of which there were
some instances during the early period of the controversy.
As respects other lands in that tract, that is, such as
were not within the terms of the proviso, we are of opinion
that they came within the general provisions of the act
and were to be disposed of thereunder for the benefit of
the Indians, in like manner as were the ceded lands in the
other reservations, of which it was said in Minnesota v.
Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, 394: "The cession was not to
the United States absolutely, but in trust. It was a cession of all of the unallotted lands. The trust was to be
executed by the sale of the ceded lands and a deposit of
the proceeds in the Treasury of the United States to the
credit of the Indians, such sum to draw interest at five
per cent."
As before stated, the lands not within the proviso were
disposed of, not under the act of 1889, but under the
general land laws; not for the benefit of the Indians, but in
disregard of their rights. This was clearly in violation of
the trust before described, and the Indians are entitled to
recover for the resulting loss. In principle it is as if the
lands had been disposed of conformably to the act of
1889 and the net proceeds placed in the trust fund created
by ยง 7, and the Government then had used the money, not
for the benefit of the Indians, but for some wholly different
purpose. That the wrongful disposal was in obedience to
directions given in two resolutions of Congress does not
make it any the less a violation of the trust. The resolu-

tions, unlike the legislation sustained in Cherokee Nation v.
Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294, 307, and Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock,
Id. 553, 564, 568, were not adopted in the exercise of the
administrative power of Congress over the property and
affairs of dependent Indian wards, but were intended to
assert, and did assert, an unqualified power of disposal
over the lands as the absolute property of the Government.
Doubtless this was because there was a misapprehension
of the true relation of the Government to the lands, but
that does not alter the result.
The Court of Claims gave no effect to the proviso to ยง 6,
and the findings afford no basis for separating the damages
rightly recoverable from those erroneously assessed on
account of lands disposed of under pre~mption and homestead entries allowed prior to the act of 1889. The case
must therefore be remanded for a reassessment of thb
damages.
By reason of a contention advanced in the briefs, it is
well to observe that the damages should be assessed on
the basis of the prices which would have been controlling
had the act of 1889 been rightly applied.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.
