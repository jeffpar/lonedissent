SINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY OF NEW
JERSEY v. BENEDICT, TREASURER, &c. OF
DENVER, COLORADO.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 289.

Argued May 5, 1913.-Decided June 9, 1913.

Under § 723, Rev. Stat., a bill in equity does not lie in the courts, of
the United States where a plain, adequate and complete remedy can
be had at law.
Where it is obvious that there is a remedy at law, it is the duty of the
court to interpose that objection sua sponte to a suit in equity.
Where, as in this case, there has been no waiver on the part of the
defendant, the objection is available in the appellate court.
The illegality or unconstitutionality of a state or municipal tax is not
itself a ground for equitable relief in the Federal courts. Boise
Water Co. v. Boise City, 213 U. S. 276.
The state courts cannot define the equity jurisdiction of the Federal

courts; but where the state c6urts have held that a suit in equity

could be maintained in the courts of the state,the same suit can be
maintained in the Federal court having jurisdiction in other respects.
In Colorado one paying an illegal tax has a remedy at law to recover
it back, and the fact that the tax list is prima facie evidence of the
amount due does not make it conclusive.
The fraud, accident or mistake necessary to justify an equitable action
to enjoin the collection of a tax must be more than mere illegality.
179 Fed. Rep. 628, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of § 723, Rev.
Stat., and the right to maintain a bill in equity to restrain
the collection of taxes where the taxpayer has a plain and
adequate remedy at law, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. R. H. Gilmore and Mr. Henry A. Prince for appellant:

The trial court, by overruling the demurrer, adjudged
that the bill was sufficient, and this became the final law
of the case upon this point, because it was not appealed

Unless a full, complete and adequate remedy at law
exists in a Federal court, the appellant has, by reason of
diverse citizenship, the right to resort to a Federal court
of equity; and this notwithstanding that the state statute
may give an adequate remedy at law in a state tribunal.

privilege and may be waived. Waite v. O'Neal, 72 Fed.,

Appellees' plea of the adequacy of legal remedy was
waived by not being pressed before the trial court, and
cannot be aVajled of here. Huntington v. Laidley, 79

v. Green, 9 C. C. A. 565.
The bill should not be dismissed in this court for lack
of equity, because if the trial court had not overruled the
demurrer "or if it had passed upon the plea a defect in
the bill could have been cured by amendment. Walla

Opinion of the Court.

As the trial court entered a decree on the merits in
favor of appellees there must have been jurisdictional
matter in the bill. It is not consistent to contend that
the trial court had jurisdiction to find for the appellees but
none to find for the appellant.
Though the tax in this case is absolutely void, the appellant has no adequate remedy at law within the decisions,
and injunction is an available and appropriate remedy.

Mr. J. A. Marsh, with whom Mr. W. H. Bryant was'
on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
This is a suit by the Singer Company, a New Jersey
corporation, to enjoin the collection of taxes levied by
the city and county of Denver, in the State of Colorado.
The company made a return of taxable personal property
at a valuation of $3,800, to which the assessor added other
personalty at a valuation of $62,500, making a total
assessment of $66,300, which was afterwards embodied in
a tax list delivered to the treasurer for collection. The
company tendered payment of $126.50, the amount of
taxes due on the property returned by it, and refused to
pay the amount attributable to the additional assessment.
The treasurer declined to accept the tender, and was
threatening to enforce the entire tax, when the suit was
brought. The bill charged that, the assessor, although
required by law to give the conpany timely notice of the
additional assessment, had failed to give it any notice,
and that it was thereby prevented from presenting

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

objections to the increase and obtaining
a hearing and
ruling thereon by the assessor and by the proper reviewing authority to which it was entitled by the local law.
There were also allegations to the effect that the coinpany
had no property within the city and county other than
that returned by it; that the additional assessment
and the taxes levied thereon were illegal because of the
assessor's failure to give the required notice; and that to
enforce the collection of such taxes would be violative of
designated provisions of the Constitution of the United
States. The defendants demurred on the ground that the
bill did not state a case for equitable relief, but the demurrer was overruled. The defendants then answered
repeating the objection made in the demurrer and interposing other defenses which need not be noticed now.
Upon the hearing a decree was entered dismissing the bill,
and the company appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
That court held that there was an adequate remedy at
law, and affirmed the decree. 179 Fed. Rep. 628. The
company then took the present appeal.
In the courts of the United States it is a guiding rule
that a bill in equity does not lie in any case where a plain,
adequate and complete remedy may be had at law. The
statute so declares, Rev. Stat., § 723, and the decisions
enforcing it are without number. If it be quite obvious
that there is such a remedy, it is the duty of the court to
interpose the objection sua sponte, and in other cases it is
tr6ated as waived if not presented by the defendant in
limine. Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S.354, 395; Allen v.
Pullman's Palace Car Co., 139 U. S.658. There was no
waiver here. The objection was made by the demurrer
and again by the answer, and so, if it was well grounded,
it was as available to the defendants in the Circuit Court
of Appeals to prevent a decree against them there as it was
in the Circuit Court. Boise Artesian Water Co. v. Boise
City, 213 U. S. 276.

SINGER SEWING MACH. CO. v. BENEDICT.
229 U. S.

485

Opinion of the Court.

In the last case it was said of the pertinency of the
guiding rule in cases such as this (p. 281): "A notable
application of the rule in the courts of the United States
has been to cases where a demand has been made to enjoin
the collection of taxes or other impositions made by state
authority, upon the ground that they are illegal or unconstitutional. The decisions of the state courts in cases
of this kind are in conflict, and we need not examine them.
It is a mere matter of choice of convenient remedy for a
State to permit its courts to enjoin the collection of a
state tax, because it is illegal or unconstitutional. Very
different considerations arise where courts of a different,
though paramount, sovereignty interpose in the same
manner and for the same reasons. An examination of the
decisions of this court shows that a proper reluctance to
interfere by prevention With the fiscal operations of the
state governments has caused it to refrain from so doing
in all cases where the Federal rights of the persons could
otherwise be preserved unimpaired. It has been held
uniformly that the illegality or unconstitutionality of a
state or municipal tax or imposition is not of itself a
ground for equitable relief in the courts of the United
States. In such a case the aggrieved party is left to his
remedy at law, when that remedy is as complete, practicable and efficient as the remedy in equity."
A statute of Colorado enacted in 1870 (Laws 1870,
p. 123, § 106) and embodied in subsequent revenue acts (2
Mills' Ann. Stat., §3777; Laws 1902, c. 3, pp. 43, 146, § 202;
Rev. Stat. 1908, § 5750) declares that "in all cases where
any person shall pay any tax, interest or costs, or any
portion thereof,, that shall thereafter be found to be
erroneous or illegal, whether the same be owing to erroneous assessment, to improper or irregular levying of the
tax, to clerical or others errors or irregularities, the board
of county commissioners shall refund the same without
abatement or discount to the taxpayer." This statute

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

imposes upon the county conmissioners the duty of refunding, without abatement or discount, taxes which have
been paid and are foundto be illegal, and confers upon the
taxpayer a correlative right to enforce that duty by an
action at law. As long ago as 1879 the Supreme Court of
the State, in holding that the invalidity of a tax afforded
no ground for enjoining its enforcement, said of this
statute: "Against an illegal tax complainant has a full and
adequate remedy at law, and we see no reason why in
thi,- case he should not be remitted to that remedy."
Price v. Kramer, 4 Colorado, 546, 555. And again: "The
statute furnishes another remedy in such cases which is
Woodward v. Ellsworth, Id.
complete and adequate."
580, 581. And that this view of the statute still prevails
is shown in Hallett v. Arapahoe County, 40 Colorado, 308,
318, decided in 1907, where, in refusing equitable relief
against the collection of taxes alleged to be illegal, the
court said (p. 318): "By § 3777, 2 Mills' Ann. Stat., it is
provided that taxes paid Which shall thereafter be found
to be erroneous or illegal, shall be refunded, without
abatement or discount, to the taxpayer. No statement
appears in either of the complaints from which it can be
deduced that the remedy afforded the plaintiff by this
section is not adequate."
We refer to these cases, not as defining the jurisdiction
in equity of the Circuit Court, for that they could not do
(Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; Whitehead v. Shattuck,
138 U. S. 146; Smythe v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 516), but
as showing that the Colorado statute gave to one who
should pay illegal taxes a right to recover back from the
county the money so paid. This right was one which
could be enforced.by an action at law in the Circuit Court,
no less than in the state courts, if the elements of Federal
jurisdiction, such as diverse citizenship and the requisite
amount in controversy, were present. Ex parte McNiel,
13 Wall. 236, 243; United States Mining Co.; v. Lawson,

.29 U. S.

487

Opinion of the Court.

134 Fed. Rep. 769, 771. Thus it will be perceived that,
if the taxes in question were illegal and void, as asserted,
the company had a remedy at law. It could pay them
and, if the commissioners refused to refund, have its
action against the county to recover back the money.
Such a remedy, as this court often has held, is plain,
adequate and complete in the sense of the guiding rule
before named, unless there be special circumstances
showing the contrary. Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 112;
Siate Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 613-614; Shelton
v. Platt, 139 U. S. 591, 597; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car
Co., Id. 658, 661; Indiana Manufacturing Co. v. Koehne,
188 U. S. 681, 686.
But, it is said that in an action to recover back the
money the tax list would be treated as the judgment of a
special tribunal conclusively determining all questions in
favor of the validity of the tax. It well may be that, if
the list were regular on its face, it would be presumptive
evidence that the tax was valid, but we find nothing in the
statules of Colorado or in the decisions of its Supreme
Court which goes to the length suggested. The plain
imp!ication of the section providing for repayment is
otherwise. Another section (Rev. Stat., § 5677) declares
that the tax list "shall be prima facie evidence that the
atount claimed is due and unpaid," and the only decision
cited by the company speaks of the assessment as being
pesumptiv'ely right "in the absence of any evidence to
the contrary." Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Denver, 46
Colorado, 50.
It also is said that there were special circumstances
calling for equitable relief, in that the act of the assessor
in making the additional assessment without giving any notiee of it was necessarily a fraud, an accident, or a mistake.
No such claim was made in the bill, and even had it been
it would be unavailing unless founded upori something
more than the charge that no notice was given and that

o(c'ToBER TERM, 1912.
Syllabus.

229 U. S.

the company had no property within the city and county
other than that returned by it. We say this because the
fraud, accident or mistake which will justify equitable
relief must be something more than what is fairly covered
by the charge here made, for otherwise the well settled
rule that mere illegality in a tax affords no ground for
such relief would be a myth. There really would be no
case in which the illegality could not be said with equal
propriety to be the result of fraud, accident or mistake,
for it always arises out of some deviation from law or duty.
Concluding, as we do, that the company had a plain,
adequate and complete remedy at law, the decree dismissing the bill is
Affirmed.

The proceedings on which the grant involved in this case was issued
are substantially the same as those in United States v. Sandoval,

Whether the original grant made in 1739 by royal authority of Spain

Territory.
In this case held that the confirmation of a Spanish grant under the

owner, passed the title to that town unburdened with any trust for
heirs or grantees of persons named in the original petition and royal
decree.
