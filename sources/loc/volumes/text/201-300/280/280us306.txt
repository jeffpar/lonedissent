Nor am I able to say that the McElwain Company,
for the stock of which petitioner gave its own stock having a market value of $9,460,000, was then in such financial straits as to preclude the reasonable inference by the
Commission that its business, conducted either through
a receivership or a reorganized company, would probably
continue to compete with that of petitioner. See Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., 258 U. S. 346,
356, 357. It plainly had large value as a going concern,
there was no evidence that it would have been worth more
or as much if dismantled, and there was evidence that the
depression in the shoe trade in 1920-1921 was then a
passing phase of the business. For these reasons and
others stated at length in-the opinion of the court below,
I think the judgment should be affirmed.

WILBUR, SECRETARY

UNITED STATES

OF THE INTERIOR, v.
EX REL.

KRUSHNIC.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA. ,

No. 63. Argued December 6, 9, 1929.-Decided January 6, 1930.
1. Under the General Mining Law, a perfected location of a mining
claim has the effect of a grant by the United States of the right
of present and exclusive possession, and so long as the owner
complies with that law, this right, for all practical purposes of
ownership, is as good as though secured by a patent. P. 316.
2. Failure to perform -the annual labor (Rev. Stats. § 2324; U. S. C.,
Title 30, § 28) renders the claim subject to loss through relocation
by another claimant, but it does not ipso facto forfeit the claim,
and no relocation can be made if work be resumed by the owner
after default and before such relocation. P. 317.

WILBUR v. KRUSHNIC.

Argument for Petiti6ner.

3. So far as the Government is concerned, failure to perform labor
in any year is without effect, and whenever $500 worth of labor
in the aggregate has been performed, and the other requirements, including the payment of the purchase price, have been
complied with, the owner is entitled to a patent, even though in some
years annual assessment labor has been omitted. P. 317.
4. Under the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, which, in
respect of lands containing oil shale and other deposits therein
specified, substituted a policy of leasing for that of location and
acquisition of title, but which, by § 37, saves valid claims existent
at the date of the Act and "thereafter maintained in compliance
with the laws under which instituted," and declares that they may
be perfected under such laws, the owner of an oil shale placer
claim which was valid at the date of the Act but upon which no
labor was performed for the assessment year in which the Act was
passed, "maintains" the claim by resuming work thereon in a
subsequent year, unless at least some form of. challenge on behalf
of the United States to the valid existence of the claim has intervened. P. 317.
5. Where the Secretary of the Interior, in declining to issue a patent
for a mining claim, interprets and applies a statute in a way contrary to its explicit terms, he departs from a plain official duty,
and the error may be corrected by mandamus in the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia. P. 318.
6. The writ of mandamus in this case should direct a disposal of the
application for patent on its merits, unaffected by the temporary
default in performance of assessment labor for the year 1920;
and that further proceedings be in conformity with the views
expressed in his opinion as to the proper interpretation and application of fLte excepting clause in the Leasing Act, and of Rev.
Stats. § 2324. P. 319.

Argument for Petitioner.

280 U. S.

Where, by the terms of an Act, the Secretary is required,
upon application of the claimant, to issue a patent or
other certificate of title, Congress, by implication, confers
upon the Secretary power to make all determinations of
law as well as of fact which are essential to the performance of the duty specifically imposed. In making such
determinations, "he acts As a special tribunal with judicial
functions." West v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U. S. 200;
Work V. Braffet, 276 U. S. 560.
The construction of the Act by the Secretary involved
the exercise of judgment and discretion, the exercise of
judicial functions. In resistance to the writ of mandamus
it is believed sufficient to show that the decision of the
Secretary was not in apparent defiance of law, nor arbitrary or capricious, but within the scope of the administrative duty confided to him. Hall v. Payne, 254 U. S.
343; Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, 190 U. S. 316; Ness v.
Fisher,223 U. S. 683; Alaska Smokeless Coal Co. v. Lane,

U. S. ex rel. Miller v. Raum, 135 U. S. 200.
The decision was in accord with previous rulings of the
Department. E. C. Kinney, 44 L. D. 580; Interstate Oil
Corp'n and Frank 0. Chittenden, 50 L. D. 262; Cro'nberg

L. D. 58. Cf. Hodgson v. Midwest Oil Co., 17 F. (2d) 71.
. The decision disturbed no vested right of respondent.
Respondent's theory as to the nature of the estate after
default in the performance of assessment work, if by
estate is meant the exclusive right of possession, is not
sustained ,by the opinion in Belk v. Meagher, 104 U. S.
279, and is incompatible with numerous' opinions of this
Court and of other eminent authorities on the mining
law. Furthermore, this theory would seem to involve the
consequence that while the Government could, after the

WILBUR v. KRUSHNIC.

Argument for Petitioner.

default, clothe a third party with the right to divest the
locator's estate, it could not of itself by legislation directly
divest it.
Under the general mining law when the default in the
performance of annual labor occurred, the land was open
public domain, subject to location and purchase under
the mining laws by another; the possessory right of the
original locators had come to an end and all that remained
td them was the privilege of resuming work before another entered whereby the delinquency would be condoned, and the right of possession restored. The possessory right terminates upon the happening of the default.

The decision of the Secretary was correct.

statutory period. That was the only exaction the mining
law had prescribed to maintain a claim. Moreover, the
frequency with which "maintained " or equivalent expres-.
sions," kept up," "kept alive," "preserved," are encountered in the decisions of this Court (See Gwillim v. Donnellan, 115 U. S. 45; Cole v. Ralph, 252 U. S. 286; El Paso
Brick Co. v. McKnight, 233 U. S. 250; Union Oil Co. v.
Smith, 249 U. S. 337) in referring to the necessity of the
annual assessment. work, gave it a well-understood
meaning.
The theory that the right to resume work under § 2324
is perpetuated by the Leasing Act as to the mineral deposits mentioned in the latter, is opposed to the policy
and purpose of the Act. First, it would take away the
penalty of forfeiture by relocation imposed in the same
section to counterbalance the privilege of resumption.
The practical effect of the recognition that such privilege
continues, is to render the estate of the locator terminable
only at his will and pleasure, no matter how negligent
the claimant has been in developing the land. He could
hold the claim against any seeker of rights and grantees
under the Leasing Act and against the Government itself,
except upon establishment that the claim had been.abandoned.
Second, if the Leasing Act intended that no new rights
could be initiated by relocation, it necessarily follows
that it did not intend that any lapsed rights should be
reinstated. Section 2324 merely created a race for priority of reentry for the purpose of development. The only
advantage the prior locator had over the relocator was
that he could dispense with the initial acts of location.
The latter could adopt the previous discovery of the prior
locator.
Third, to hold that the right to resume work was preserved by the Leasing Act; would render its-proper admin-

istration with respect to lands known to be valuable for
oil shale deposits, difficult if not impossible.
An actual entry or office found is not necessary to enable the Government to take advantage of a condition
broken, and to resume' the possession of lands that have
been forfeited. United States v. Repentigny, 5 Wall.
211; Schulenberg v. Harriman, 21 Wall. 44; Farnsworth
v. Minnesota'& P. R. Co., 92 U. S. 49; McMicken v.
United States, 97 U. S. 204.
Respondent's contention that some overt act by the
Government should take place evincing an intent to repossess the land, or that some judicial proceeding should
be initiated before work was resumed, is predicated upon
the fallacious premise that the right of resumption of
work after default remained after the Leasing Act, and
that the Government, therefore, must act the part of a
relocator, and get in before the locator gets back.
The entry and improvements made after the default by
the respondent in an effort to qualify him to obtain a
patent were made in violation of law. He could gala no
rights thereby. He, therefore, could set up no equities
against the Government by reason thereof. Defleback v.

it has been repeatedly held that the Government has

Moreover, the performance or nonperformance of annual labor under § 2324 did not affect the right of a locator
to a patent under § 2325.
Section 2324 is a penal statute to be construed strictly
in favor of the claim-owner. The penalty for failure to
perform assessment work within the assessment year has
been confined strictly within the language of the statute.
The rule has been firmly established th it the owner of a
mining claim does not lose his estate upon such failure,
and that the only penalty resulting from it is the possibility that adverse rights may be initiated, provided always
that such initiation take place prior to the resumption of
work by the original owner. Belk v. Meagher, 104 U. S.

in the maintenance are placed upon its owner, nor is any
privilege or right which he enjoyed under the old laws
taken away by the new. If any such deprivation had been
attempted, there would be presented a question of the
constitutional power of Congress.
The Secretary has attempted to preserve all- of the
burdens placed upon the owner by § 2324, and, at the
same time, to take away the benefit of the right of' resumption which is conferred by that section. Such a construction is impossible. Cf. Thatcher v. Brown, 190 Fed.
708.
The policy or purpose of the Leasing Act cannot affect
claims excepted from its operation. They must be
scrutinized in the light of the policy and purpose of
the old mining laws under which they were initiated.
The policy and purpose of the latter were to encourage
the development of the mineral resources of the country
by extending privileges to the persons who undertook such
development. Admittedly, under such prior 'laws, the
Government had no interest in annual labor.
Abandonment and forfeiture distinguished. Lindley
on Mines, 3d ed., vol. 2, § 643, pp. 1597, 1598; Justice
Mining Co. v. Barclay, 82 Fed. 554.
The Leasing Act has not removed the necessity of
assessment work on the part of the owners of mining
claims covering the mineral substances embraced in that
Act. If assessment work is in default and the owner
fails to resume it, a third persofi may make application
for a lease or may locate the ground for mineral substances not covered by the Leasing Act. Again, the question may be raised by a third person who has initiated
rights under laws other than the mining laws.
In the absence of some appropriate judicial action,
there must be some appropriate legislative action before
a forfeiture may be accomplished for condition broken.

MR.

JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The disposition of this case depends upon the construction and application of § 2324, R. S. (U. S. C. Title
30, §28), and the effect upon its provisions of § 37 of the
Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat.
437, 451 (U. S. C. Title 30, § 193). Section 2324, R. S.,
which has its origin in § 5 of the Mining Act of 1872
(c. 152, 17 Stat. 91, 92), provides:
"On each claim located after the tenth day of May,
eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and until a patent has
been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars'
worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made
during each year. . . . and upon a failure to comply
with these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such
failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same
manner as if no location of the same had ever been made,
provided that the original locators, their heirs, assigns, or
legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the
claim after failure and before such location."
By § 2325, R. S. (U. S. C., Title 30, § 29), provision is
made for issuing patents for claims located under the mining laws. One of the prerequisites, and the only one in
respect of labor, is that the claimant must show "that
$500 worth of labor has been expended or improvements
made upon the claim by himself or grantors."
The Leasing Act of 1920 effected a complete change of
policy in respect of the disposition of lands containing deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, oil, oil shale, and gas.
Such lands were no longer to be open to location and acquisition of title, but only to lease. But § 37 (U. S. C.
Title 30, § 193) contains a saving clause protecting "valid
claims existent at date of the passage of this Act and

WILBUR v. KRUSHNIC.

Opinion of the Court.

thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under
which initiated," and declaring that they "may be perfected under such laws, including discovery."
On October 1, 1919i respondent and seven associates, all
qualified under the law, located a tract of land in Garfield
County, Colorado, under the name of Spad No. 3 placer
claim. The land contained valuable deposits of oil shale
and was open to appropriation under the mining laws of
the United States. Spad No. 3 placer claim formed one
of a group of six oil placer claims, numbered Spad No. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively, all located and owned by the
same persons, and lying adjacent to each other. The
assessment year 1920, by act of Congress, was extended
until July 1, 1921. Prior to that date, annual labor
amounting in value, it was asserted, to more than .$600
was performed on claims numbered 4, 5 and 6, with the
intention that said labor should apply to the entire group.
Subsequently; respondent acquired the interest of his
co-locators in the Spad No. 3, and, during and for the
assessment year 1921, performed thereon assessment labor
of an admitted value of more than $100, and continued
to perform labor and make improvements on the claim
until the aggregate value exceeded $500. On September
25, 1922, he applied for a patent, and, having complied
with the statutory requirements and paid the purchase
price, obtained final receiver's receipt on December 16,
1922. No relocation of the claim was ever attempted, nor
was the Valid existence or maintenance of the claim ever
challenged in anywise by the United States, or by anyone,
prior to the issue of the receiver's receipt. Thereafter, a
proceeding against the entry was instituted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office; and that officer,
after consideration, held the claim null and void upon the
sole ground of insufficient assessment labor for the year
1920. This holding was affirmed by the Secretary of the
Interior.

316

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

In all the proceedings before the land officers and the
Secretary, it was conceded, as it is here conceded, that the
claim was valid and existent when the Leasing Act was
passed; and that no reason existed, or now exists, for
withholding a patent, save the alleged failure of assessment labor for the assessment year 1920. The Secretary
held that by such failure, all rights to the claim became
extinguished and could not be saved or revived by a
resumption of work.
Thereupon, respondent applied by petition to the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ
of mandamus to compel the Secretary to issue a patent
to the claim. After a hearing on rule to show cause, that
court discharged the rule and dismissed the petition.
Upon appeal this judgment was reversed by the Court
of Appeals for the District. 30 F. (2d) 742.
Two questions are presented for determination: (1)
Did the Leasing Act of 1920 have the effect of extinguishing the right of the locator, under § 2324, to save
his claim under the original location by resuming work
after failure to perform annual assessment labor? (2)
Is the case a proper one for the writ of mandamus?
1. The rule is established by innumerable decisions of
this Court, and of state and lower federal courts, that
when the location of a mining claim is perfected under
the law, it has the effect of a grant by the United States
of the right of present and exclusive possession. The
claim is property in the fullest sense of that ,term; and
may be sold, transferred, mortgaged, and inherited without infringing any right or title of the United States.
The right of the owner is taxable by the state; and is
"real prQperty" subject to the lien of a judgment recovered against the owner in a state or territorial court.
Belk v. Meagher, 104 U. S. 279, 283; Manuel v. Wulff,
152 U. S. 505, 510-511; Elder v. Wood, 208 U. S. 226,

WILBUR v. KRUSHNIC.
306

Opinion of the Court.

232; Bradford v. Morrison, 212 U. S. 389. The owner is
not required to purchase the claim or secure patent from
the United States; but so long as he complies with the
provisions of the mining laws, his possessory right, for all
practical purposes of ownership, is as good as though secured by patent. While he is required to perform labor
of the value of $100 annually, a failure to do so does not
ipso facto forfeit the claim, but only renders it subject
to loss by relocation. And the law is clear that no relocation can be made if work be resumed after default
and before such relocation.
Prior to the passage of the Leasing Act, annual performance of labor was not necessary to preserve the possessory right, with all the incidents of ownership above
stated, as against the United States, but only as against
subsequent relocators. So far as the government was
concerned, failure to do assessment work for any year
was without effect. Whenever $500 worth of labor in
the aggregate had been performed, other requirements
aside, the owner became entitled to a patent, even though
in some years annual assessment labor had been omitted.
P. Wolenberg et al., 29 L. D. 302, 304; Nielson v. Champagne Mining & M. Co., 29 L. D. 491, 493.
It being conceded that the Spad No. 3 "was a valid
claim existent on February 25, 1920," the only question
is whether, within the terms of the excepting clause of
§ 37, the claim was "thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated." These words
are plain and explicit, and we have only to expound
them according to their obvious and natural sense.
It is not doubted that a claim initiated under § 2324,
R. S., could be maintained by the performance of annual
assessment work of the value of $100; and we think it is
no less clear that after failure to do assessment work, the
owner equally maintains his claim, within the meaning

318

Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

of the Leasing Act, by a resumption of work, unless at
least some form of challenge on behalf of the United
States to the valid existence of the claim has intervened;
for as this court said in Belk v. Meagher, supra, at page
283, "His rights after resumption were precisely what
they would have been if no default [that is, no default
in the doing of assessment labor] had occurred." Resumption of work by the owner, unlike a relocation by
him, is an act not in derogation but in affirmance of the
original location; and thereby the claim is " maintained"
no less than it is by performance of the annual assessment
labor. Such resumption does not restore a lost estatesee Knutson v. Fredlund, 56 Wash. 634, 639; it preserves
an existing estate. We are of opinion that the Secretary's
decision to the contrary violates the plain words of the
excepting clause of the Leasing Act.
2. While the decisions of this Court exhibit a reluctance
to direct a writ of mandamus against an executive officer,
they recognize the duty to do so by settled principles of
law in some cases. Lane v. Hoglund, 244 U. S.174, 191,
and cases cited. In Roberts v. United States, 176 U. S.
221, 231, referred to and quoted in the Hoglund case, this
Court said:
"Every statute to some extent requires construction
by the public officer whose duties may be defined therein.
Such officer must read the law, and he must therefore,
in a certain sense, construe it, in order to form a judgment from its language what duty he is directed by the
statute to perform. But that does not necessarily and
in all cases make the duty of the officer anything other
than a purely ministerial one. If the law direct him to
perform an act in regard to which no discretion is committed to him, and which, upon the facts existing, he is
bound to perform, then that act is ministerial, although
depending upon a statute which requires, in some degree,

WILBUR v. KRUSHNIC.
306

Opinion of the Court.

a construction of its language by the officer. Unless this
be so, the value of this writ is very greatly impaired.
Every executive officer whose duty is plainly devolved
upon him by statute might refuse to perform it, and when
his refusal is brought before the court he might successfully plead that the performance of the duty involved
the construction of a statute by him, and therefore it
was not ministerial, and the court would on that account
be powerless to give relief. Such a limitation of the
powers of the court, we think, would be most unfortunate, as it would relieve from judicial supervision all
executive officers in the performance of their duties,
whenever they should plead that the duty required of
them arose upon the construction of a statute, nomatter
how plain its language, nor how plainly they violated
their. duty in refusing to perform the act required."
See also Ballinger v. Frost, 216 U. S.240, 250.
In this case, the Secretary interpreted and applied
a statute in a way contrary to its explicit terms, and in
so doing, departed from a .plain official duty. A writ of
mandamus should issue directing a disposal of the application for patent on its merits, unaffected by the temporary default in the performance of assessment labor for
the assessment year 1920; and that further proceedings
be in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion
as to the proper interpretation and application of the
excepting clause of the Leasing Act of February 25, 1920,
and of § 2324, Revised Statutes of the United States. A
writ in that form follows the precedent established by
this Court in respect of; the writ of injunction in Payne
v. Central Pac. Ry.- Co., 255 U. S.228, 238, and Payne
v. New Mexico, 255 U. S. 367, 373, as being better
suited to the occasion than that indicated by the District Court of Appeals. As so modified the judgment of
that court is
Affirmed.
