It follows that the rule against the respondents must be
made absolute with directions to them to vacate the decree
of dismissal entered by Judge Bourquin and to take immediate steps for assembling a court of three judges to
hear and determine the application for an interlocutory

Rule made absolute.
RAILROAD COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA ET AL.
v. LOS ANGELES RAILWAY CORPORATION.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 60. Argued October 22, 1929.-Decided December 2, 1929.
1. A State may authorize a municipal corporation by agreement to
establish public service rates and thereby to suspend for a term
of years not grossly excessive the exertion of governmental power
by legislative action to fix just compensation to be paid for service
furnished by public utilities. P. 151.
2. To determine whether such authority has blen given in the case
before it, this Court, in the absence of decisions of the state courts,
must .onstrue the state laws. P. 152.
3. As it is in the public interest that till doubts be resolved, in favor
of the right of the State from time to time to prescribe rates, a
grant of authority to surrender the power is not to be inferred in
the absence of a plain expression of purpose to that end. Id.
4. The following laws of California are considered and held not to
have-authorized the City of Los Angeles to fix the rates of street
car companies by contract:
(1) Civil Code, § 470 (Mar. 21, 1872,) merely regulating procedure; id. § 497 (Stats. 1891, p. 12,) authorizing political subdivisions to grant authority for the laying of railroads in streets
"under such restrictions and limitations" as they may provide;

id. § 501 (Stats. 1903, p. 172,) providing that the rate of fare in
municipalities of the first class "must not exceed five cents." P. 153.
(2) T:'. .roughton Franchise Act (Stats. 1893, p. 288,) as
amended, providing that franchises "shall be granted upon the
conditions in this Act provided and not otherwise," and requiring the sale of such. franchises upon advertisement stating the
character of the franchise or privilege proposed to be granted,
but nowhere expressly emp6wering the city to establish rates by
contract; and the amendment thereof, June 8, 1915 (Stats. 1915, p.
1300,) which authorizes grantors of such franchises to impose
such additionl terms and conditions whether "governmental or
contractual in character" as in their judgment are in the public
interest. P. 154.
(3) Provisions of the charter of the City of Los Angeles, viz.,
Art. I, § 2 (25), Stats. 1905, p. 994, forbidding the granting of
franchises for use of public streets except by a specified vote and
for a term not to exceed 21 years and providing that "Every
grant . . . shall make adequate provision by way of forfeiture
or otherwise to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates and the maintenance of the property in good order
throughout the term of the grant "; Art. I, § 2 (30), Stats. 1911,
p. 2063, empowering the city to fix " rates . . . for
the conveyance of passengers . . . by means of street railway
cars," and "To regulate, subject to the provisions of the constitution of the State . . . the construction and operation of
. .
street railways . . . "; Art. I, § 2 (40), Stats. 1913, p. 1633, empowering the city to grant franchises for furnishing transportation
-and to prescribe the terms and conditions of such grants and to
prescribe the procedure for making them. P. 155.
5. A State has power, upon the application of a street railway company, to terminate rates of fare fixed by contract between the
company and a municipal corporation of the State. P. 156.
6. Under Art. XII, § 23, of the California Constitution, as amended
November 3, 1914, and: the Public Utilities Act of April 23, 1915,
the Railroad Commission has exclusive authority to regulate rates.
A five cent street railway fare, even if established by franchise contract, maybe increased with the approval of the Commission, and
not otherwise, and it is the duty of the Commission, upon finding
that the rate is unjust or insufficient, to determine the just and
reasonable rate thereafter to be observed. P. 157.
7. The Railroad Commission, upon successive applications of a
street railway company in Los Angeles for increased fares at first

found the existing fares insufficient and permitted a small increase,,
which the company declined, and later found the existing fares
sufficient, thus in legal effect requiring the company to observe
them. Held that, assuming the existing fares had been established
by franchise contracts, these exercises of jurisdiction by the Commission abrogated the contracts. Pp. 156-158.

APPEAL

Mr. Arthur T. George, with whom Messrs. Ira H. Rowell
and Roderick B. Cassidy were on the brief, for the Railroad Commission of California.
Appellee's franchises are contracts.
Where a valid contract fixing rates has been entered
into between a city and a public utility, there is no confiscation.
The contracts were binding as between the parties until
the Commission exercised the power delegated to it by
the legislature by increasing the contract rate in the manner provided by the Public Utilities Act. Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, 268 U. S. 232; Opelika v. Opelika

The Commission's orders of 1921 and 1928 did not abrogate the rates fixed in the various franchise contracts.
Rates may be changed only by strict compliance with
the applicable statutory procedure. Wichita R. & L. Co.

It is immaterial that a rate for public service fixed by
valid contract between a municipal corporation and a
public service corporation may be confiscatory. St. Cloud

Mr. Woodward M. Taylor, with whom Messrs. S. M.
Haskins, Paul R. Watkins, and Herbert F. Sturdy were
on the brief, for appellee.
The city has never possessed the power to fix public
utility rates by contract.
Under the state constitution the legislature cannot fix
public utility rates by contract nor delegate power to the

city to do so.
In California, the grant of a franchise is a legislative
function and where, as here, no grant of authority to fix
rates by contract exists, franchise fare provisions cannot
operate by way of condition or estoppel. South Pasadena v. Terminal R. Co., 109.Cal. 315.
The fare provisions of these' franchises evince an intention to regulate, not to contract.
The Commission has twice exercised jurisdiction over
the company's franchise fare. Even assuming the franchise fare provisions constitute contract obligations, the
Commission, by its decision in 1921, abrogated that obli-

gation by finding the 50 fare inadequate and authorizing
a 60 fare; and, there being no power in the city to:contract as to public utility rates, the 50 fare was not a contract obligation and consequently the Commission, by itsdecision in 1928, had exercised its complete, jurisdiction
over the fare and, by denying any increase, had deprived
the company of its rights under the Federal Constitution.
Cf. Denney v. Pacific T. & T. Cq., 276 U. S. 97.
MR. JUST4CE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellee operates a street railway system and motor
buses for the transportation of passengers in the city of
Los. Angeles and in other parts of the county of Los
Angeles. Its cars are operated on tracks laid in the .treetR
under authority of 102 franchises* granted from time to
time since 1886. A few were obta;ned from*the county;
the others were granted by the city.
Seventy-three granted between Novernber 28, 1890, and
October 21, 1918, covering 113.41 miles, provide that "the
rate of fare
. .
shall not exceed five cents."
Eighteen granted between7 \larch 2, 1920, and January 21, 1928, covering 12.33 miles, provide that "the
rate of -fare . . . shall not be more than five cents
except upon a showing before a competent authority having jurisdiction over rates of fare that such
greater charge is justified.",
The remaining eleven, covering 10.5 miles, were granted
at various times from 1886 to 1923 , none of them pro:vides that the fare shall' not exceed five centg; but it may
be assumed that under the provisions of the other ordinances a fare of five cents was made applicable over all
lines. Prior to the decree in this case the basic fare
charged was five cents.
Maintaining that its existing rates were not sufficient
to yield a reasonable return, the company, November 16,
1926,,applied to the commission for authority to increase

R. R. COMM'N v. LOS ANGELES R. CO.
145

Opinion of the Court.

the basic fare to seven cents'in cash or six and one-fourth
cents in tokens to be furnished by the company, four for
twenty-five cents. The commission, March 26, 1928,
made a report and by an order denied the application A
petition for rehearing was denied.
June 22, 1928, the company brought this suit to have
the rates and order adjudged confiscatory and for temporary and permanent injunctions restraining the commission from enforcing them. The city intervened as
party defendant. The case came on for hearing before
three judges on an application for temporary injunction.
U. S. C., Tit. 28, § 380. Affidavits were submitted, a
transcript of all the evidence before the commission wa
received and the parties stipulated that thereon the ca&_
should be finally determined on the merits. The court
found that the rates will not permit the company to earn
a reasonable return and are confiscatory; and by its decree permanently enjoined the commission from enforcing them.
The sole controversy is whether the company is bound
by contract with the city to continue to serve for the
fares specified in the franchises-it being conceded that
the finding below respecting the inadequacy of the five
cent fare is sustained by the evidence. Appellants contend that at all times the city had power to establish
rates by agreement and that the franchise provisions constitute binding contracts that are still in force. On the
other hand the company maintains that the State never
so empowered the city; and it insists that, if the power
was given and any such contracts were made, they have
been abrogated.
1. It is possible for a State to authorize a municipal
corporation by agreement to establish public service rates
and thereby to suspend for a term of years not grossly excessive the exertion of governmental power by legislative
action to fix just compensation to be paid for service

the -latter may not be required to serve for less even if
the specified rates are unreasonably high. Detroit v. De.troitCitizens' R. Co., supra, 389. And, in such case, the
courts may not relieve the utility from its obligation to
serve at the agreed rates however inadequate they may
prove to be. Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, supra.
This court is bound by the decisions of the highest
courts of the States as to the powers of their municipalities. Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, 262 U. S. 432, 438.
Our attention has not been called to any California decision, and we think there is none, which decides that
the state legislature has empowered Los Angeles to establish rates by contract. This Court is therefore required
to construe the state laws on which appellants rely. As
it is in the public interest that all doubts. be resolved in
favor of the right of the State from time to time to prescribe rates, a grant of authority to surrender the power
is not to be inferred in the absence of a plain expression
of purpose to that end. The delegation of authority to
give up or suspend the power of rate regulation will not
be. found more readily than would an intention on the
part of the State to authorize the bargaining away of its
power to tax. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514,

pany's franchise was granted under the Broughton Franchise Act, which provided that every such franchise " shall
be granted upon the conditions in this act provided and
not otherwise." . The city charter gave power to its council to fix charges for telephone service. The franchise
stated that the rates should not exceed specified amounts.
An ordinance prescribing lower rates was passed. The
company brought suit for injunction against its enforcement on the ground that the ordinance violated the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. The
city insisted that it had not been empowered by the State
to make such a contract, and this court upheld its contention. It said (p. 273): "The surrender, by contract,
of a power of government, though in certain well-defined
cases it may be made by legislative authority, is a very
grave act, and the surrender itself, as well as the authority
to make it, must be closely scrutinized. . . . The
general powers of a municipality or of any other political
subdivision of the State are not sufficient. Specific
authority for that purpose is required." And, dealing
with the charter provision there relied on by the company, the court said (p. 274): "The charter gave to the
council the power 'by ordinance . . .. to regulate
telephone service and the use of telephones within the
city, ....
and to fix and determine the charges for
telephones and telephone service and connections.' This
is an ample au*thority to exercise the governmental' power
but entirely unfitted to describe the authority to
contract. It authorizes command, but not agreement."
Section 470 of the Civil Code (March 21, 1872) cited
by appellants merely regulates procedure. Section 497
authorizes political subdivisions to grant authority for
the laying of railroads in streets "under such restrictions
and limitations." as they may provide. Stats. 1891, p, 12.
This is too general. The clause in § 501 (Stats. 1903,
p. 172) providing that the rate of fare in municipalities

of the first class "must not exceed five cents" does not
relate to the power to contract, and plainly has no application here because Los Angeles never belonged to that
class.
Section 1 of the Broughton Franchise Act ' provides
that franchises "shall be granted upon the conditions in
this Act provided and not otherwise." The Act requires
the sale of such franchises upon advertisement stating the
character of the franchise or privilege proposed to be
granted, but it nowhere expressly empowers the city to
establish rates by contract. This court in the Home Telephone Company case dealt with the quoted provision., It
said (p. 275): "Here is an emphatic caution against reading into the act any conditions which are not clearly expressed in the act itself..... .. It cannot be supposed
that the legislature intended that so significant and important an authority as that of contracting away a power
of regulation conferred by the charter should be inferred
from the act in the absence of a-grant in express words.
But there is no such grant." And, so far as concerns the
matter under consideration, the Act was not expanded by
the amendment of June 8, 1915. It authorizes grantors of
such franchises to impose such additional terms and con'Its first sentence, as originally enacted, read: "Every franchise

any public street or highway, or 'to exercise any other privilege

whatever hereafter proposed to be granted by the

upon the conditions in this Act provided, and not otherwise." Stats.
1893, p. 288. The Act was amended in 1897 (Stats. 1897, pp. 135,
177); re-enacted in 1901 (Stats. 1901, p. 265) and 1905 (Stats. 1905,
p. 777) and amended in 1909. Stats, 1909, p. 125. The first sentence has remained substantially' the same. The amendment of June
8, 1915 (Stats. 1915; p. 1300) inserted immediately after this sentence: "The. grantor may, however, in such franchise impose such
other and additional terms. and conditions not in conflict herewith,
whether governmental or contractual in character, as in the judgment
of the legislative body thereoT are to the public interest."

R. R. COMM'N v. LOS ANGELES R. CO. 155

ditions "whether governmental or contractual in character" as in their judgment are in the public interest. This
general language does not measure up to the rule earlier
invoked here by Los Angeles and applied by this court in
the Home Telephone Company case.
The appellants invoke provisions of the city charter
which are printed in the margin.2 But it requires no
discussion to show that they are not sufficient to empower the city by contract to establish rates. In support
of their claim, they cite Columbus R. & P. Co. v. Columbus, 249 U. S. 399; Opelika v. Opelika Sewer Co.,
265 U. S. 215; Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, supra,
and Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka,268 U. S. 232. But
the Columbus case did not involve,' and this Court did
not there decide, the question of power. See p. 407 and
194 U. S. at pp. 532, 534. And in the other cases, we followed the decisions of the courts of the respective States..

Appellants have failed to sustain their contention that
the city was empowered to make such rate contracts.
2. But assuming that the fares were established by the
franchise contracts we are of opinion that such contracts
have been abrogated. The State had power upon the
company's application, through its commission or otherwise, to terminate them. Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil &
Gas Co., 250 U. S. 394. Trenton v. New Jersey, 262
U. S. 182, 186. Henderson Water.Co. v. Corporation
Commission, 269 U. S. 278. Denney v. Pacific Tel. Co.,
276 U. S. 97.
. November 30, 1918, the company applied to have the
commission investigate its service and financial condition
and. for an order authorizing it to " so operate its system
and change its rates that the income will be sufficient to
pay the costs of the service." May 31, 1921. the coinmission found that the existing fares would not permit the
company to collect enough to enable it to provide adequate service. See P. U. R. 1922A, 66, 90. And it made
an order permitting a small increase. The company did
not accept it, but applied for a rehearing. After several
postponements the case was stricken from the calendar,
and some years later the company asked that its application be dismissed. The commission, October 18, 1926,
granted the company's request and also revoked the order.
Shortly thereafter the company applied for a basic fare
of seven cents in cash or six and one-quarter cents in
tokens, The fares so proposed were substantially higher
than those which were not accepted by the company.
Again the commission made extensive,. investigations.
And March 26, 1928, it filed a report which contained
findings as to the value of the property, operating rev.
enues, operating expenses including cost of depreciation
and taxes, amount available for return, average net income for five years ending with 1926, stated that the cost
of operation might be reduced, and concluded that by
reason of such facts the rates of fare charged by the com-

pany were not unreasonable and that the rates proposed
would be unjust and unreasonable. And the commission
made an order denying the company's application.
There is no decision in the courts of the State as to the
effect of the proceedings before and action taken by the
commission, and therefore we are required to construe
the applicable provisions of the local constitution and
statutes. Deincy v. Pacific Tel. Co., supra, 101. Under
the state constitution, Art. XII, § 23, as amended November 3, 1914, and the Public Utilities Act of April 23.
1915, the commission has exclusive power to regulate
rates. And § 27 of the Act ' gave to street railway companies the right to charge more than five cents upon
showing before the commission that the higher charge is
justified. No distinction is made between rates established by franchise contracts and those otherwise fixed.
Fares may not be changed without approval of the commission. The policy of the State is that all rates shall be
just and reasonable (§ 15) and the commission is directed,
whenever after hearing had upon its own motion or
upon complaint it shall find that rates are unjust or insufficient, to determine the just and reasonable rates
thereafter to be observed. § 32(a).' The language used
Section 27 declares that fares of more than five cents shall not be
charged on street railroads " except upon a showing before the commission that such greater charge is justified; provided, that until the
decision of the commission upon such showing, a street . . . rail. . . receive the fare lawfully

the powPer and duty to fix reasonable and compensatory
rates irrespective of any previous municipal action. We
must treat the result as a bona fide effort to comply with
the local statute."
The proceedings before the commission And its orders
clearly show that it twice t~ok jurisdiction to determine
just and reasonable rates. Its order of May 31, 1921,
by reason of the company's failure to put in the increased
rates never became operative and finally was vacated.
The report and order of March 26, 1928, found that' xisting rates were just and reasonable and in legal effect
required the company to continue to observe them. The
court below found the rates confiscatory, and appellants
do not here question that finding.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS is Of opinion that, as our
finding that the city had no power to make rate contractsis sufficient to dispose of the case, it would be better not
to take up the second point.
MR. JUSTICE.BRANDEIS,

dissenting.

The Railway claims that the Commission's refusal to
authorize a fare higlher than five cents confiscates its
property. The City and the Commission do not insist
here that the five-cent fare is compensatory; and they
concede that, since, 1915, the latter has had jurisdiction
to authorize a higher fare. They defend solely on the
ground that the Railway bound itself by contracts not
to charge more; that these contract provisions are still
in force, except as modified by the Act of 1915 empowering the Commission to authorize changes in the rate;

that an alleged error of the Commission in refusing authority to charge more can be corrected only by proceedings brought in the Supreme Court of the State to compel
the Commission to do its duty; and that the lower court's
finding that the rate is non-compensatory is, therefore,
immaterial.
The District Court recognized that such contracts, if
existing, would be a complete defense to this suit, Columbus Ry. & Power Co. v. Columbus, 249 U. S. 399; Georgia
Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, 262 U. S.432; Opelika, v.
Opelika Sewer Co., 265 U. S. 215; St. Cloud Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, 265 U. S. 352; Southern Utilities
Co. v. Palatka, 268 U. S. 232; expressed a strong doubt
whether the City ever had the power to contract concerning the rate of fare; and, declining to pass upon that
question, granted the relief prayed for Solely on the
ground that any such contract right which existed had
been abrogated.
The franchises under which the Railway is operating
are confessedly contracts: The words used concerning the
rate of fare are apt ones to express contractual obligations. The Railway contends, however, that the fare provisions were not intended to be contracts, and that, if
they were so intended, they were not binding, because
neither the City nor the County had the power to contract as to the rate of fare. It insists further that if
the fare provisions were originally binding as .contracts,
they were abrogated in 1921 or 1928 by action of the
Commission.
First. Most of the franchises were granted before the
State had vested in the Commission power to regulate
street railway rates or had expressly reserved to itself,
otherwise, the power to change rates theretofore fixed by
ordinance. This power of regulation was first expressly
conferred upon the Commission in 1915, by amendment s
to §§ 13. 27 and 63 of the Public Utilities Act, Stats. 1915,

p. 115, made pursuant to an amendment of § 23 of Article
XII of the California Constitution adopted November 3,
1914. These enactments did not purport to abrogate any
existing contract. Nor did they purport to take from the
City or from the County any power theretofore possessed
to make a contract concerning the rate of fare. Their
effect was merely to make any such contrdct, ' whether
theretofore or thereafter entered into, subject- to change
by the Commission. Unless and until so changed a contractual fare fixed by franchise remains in full force.
Henderson Water Co. v. Corp. Comm., 269 U. S. 278,
281-2. Consequently, it is not here claimed that these
enactments alone abrogated the alleged contracts as to
rate of fare.
Second. The Railway contends, however, that the
Commission abrogated the fare contracts by its action
taken in 1921 pursuant to this. legislation. The facts are
these. In 1918, the Railway asked the Commission to
make an investigation of its service and its.financial condition and for an order enabling it to so operate its systein that the income would be sufficient to pay the cost
of the service. In that application the Railway expressly
disclaimed any desire to increase its rate of fare, but about
made a supplemental application for
two years later, it.
leave to do so. On May 31, 1921, the Commission mad
a.report in which it declared that." an increase in the fare
in some form" 'should be granted; and that the Railway
be authorized "to file with the Commission and put into
effect within thirty (30) days from the date of this order
a schedule of rates increasing the present basic 5-cent
fare to 6 cents," ten tickets for 50 cents. 19 Cal. R. R.
Comm. Op. 980, 1002. The Railway did not file a schedule offares. Instead, it moved for a rehearing. That
motion was promptly set down for hearing by the Commission, but was never heard. For the Railway asked
first for an adjournment; then that its motion be stricken

R. R. COMM'N v. LOS ANGELES R. CO.
145

B.RANDEIS,

J., dissentin.

from the calendar; and finally, that an order be entered
setting aside the decision made and dismissing the entire
proceeding, including the application for increase of fare.
This request of the Railway was granted, the order of
dismissal reciting that the authorization to increase the
fare had "been suspended by virtite of the pqndency of a
petition for rehearing," as the statutes provided. Public
Utility Act, § 66. Obviously this action taken in 1921
cannot be deemed an abrogation or modification of any
existing fare provision of the franchises, unless it be held
that mere entry by the Commission upon an enquiry as
to the rate of fare, as commanded by the statute, has that
effect. Reason and authority are to the contrary.
Third. Nor did the action taken by the Commission
in 1928, in the proceedings now under review, abrogate
any existing fare provision. There also the Commission
took jurisdiction, as it was by the statute required to do.
It refused to authorize a, higher fare, because it concluded
that for the past five years the Railway had been earning
an average annual return of 7.1 per cent; that it was not
being efficiently operated; that the management had failed
to introduce certain economies previously recommended
which would have increased its net earnings; and that for
these reasons the existing five-cent fare was just and reasonable. The Commission may have erred in its judgment, but it is clear that it did not change the rate of fare.
In GeorgiaRy. & Power Co. v. Decatur, 262 U. S. 432, 439,
it was held that the assumption of jurisdiction by the
Commission to the extent of affirmatively ordering the
continuance of existing transfer privileges did not effect
an abrogation of an existing contract provision relating
thereto, since such action did not conflict with the terms
of the contract. Compare Los Angeles v. Los Angeles
City Water Co., 177 U. S. 558, 578-84; Minneapolis v.
Street Ry. Co., 215 U. S. 417, 435. In Denney v. Pacific
Telephone Co., 276 U. S. 97, the Commission had previSi 325 1-30 -- 11

280 U. S.

ously granted an increase in fare of which the Company
had availed itself.
Assuming that the Railway was bound by contract to
maintain a five-cent fare, it could be relieved from its obligation only by the Commission. Had the Commission
authorized an increase in fare, it would still be questionable whether the contract would have been thereby abrogated or only modified by making the Railway's obligation less onerous. Surely, the Commission's refusal to
grant any help, because in its opinion none is needed, cannot have the anomalous effect of entirely relieving the
Railway of its obligation.
Fourth. If the District Court erred in holding that the
action taken in 1921 or 1928 had the effect of abrogating
any existing contract, there must be a determination
whether such contracts did exist, in fact and law. It
was assumed by the District Court and by counsel in this
Court that if the City lacked the power to bind itself
contractually by the fare provisions, the Railway could
not be bound thereby. This conclusion is not commanded
by logic or by the law of contracts. Lack of power in the
municipality to bind itself is a factor to be considered in
determining whether-the parties intended to enter into a
contract. But, if they did, the Railway's promise need
not fail for lack of mutuality. The law does not require
that a particular contractual obligation must be supported by a corresponding counter-obligation. It is conceded that the City possessed the power to enter into the
franchise contract. The contention is merely that it could
not surrender its power to regulate rates. But there is
nothing in the fare provisions to indicate that the City
attempted to do that. These provisions in terms bind
only the Railway. The Railway unquestionably had
power to agree to charge a fixed fare. The grant of the
franchise is sufficient consideration, if so intended, for any
number of contractual obligations which the Railway may

R. R. COMM'N v. LOS ANGELES R. CO.
145

tXNDEIS,

163

J., dissenting.

have chosen to assume. In Southern Iowa Electric Co. v.
Chariton, 255 U. S. 539, a, case coming from Iowa, it was
held, following Iowa decisions, that since thc city lacked
power to bind itself, there was no contract. And there is
a statement to that effect in San Antonio v. San Antonio
Public Service Co., 255 U. S. 547, 556. But in Southern
Utilities Co. v. Palatka, 26S U. S. 232..233, the question
was expressly left open. Obviously, that is.a: matter of
state law on which the decisiolls of tiis Court are not
cont rolling.
Fifth. If it be true that the Railway is not bound by the
fare provisions, unless the City had power to bind itself
in that respect, it is necessary to determine whether the
City had that power and whether the parties did in fact
contract as to the rate of fare. Whether the City had
the power is, of course. a question of state law. In California, the constitution and the statutes leave the question. in doubt. Counsel agree that there is no decision
in any court of the State directly in point. They reason
from policy and analogy. In support of their several contentions they cite, in the aggregate, 30 de .isions of the
California courts, 15 statutes of the State, besides 3 provisions of its code and 7 provisions of its constitution.
The decisions referred to occupy 308 pages of the official
reports; the sections of the constitution, code and statutes,
173 pages. Moreover, the 102 franchises here involved
were granted at many different times between 1886 and
1927. And during that long period, there have been
amendments both of relevant statutes and of the constitution. The City or the County may have had the power
to contract as to the rate of fare at one time and not at
another. If it is held that the City or the County ever
had the power to contract as to rate of fare, it will be
necessary to examine the 102 franchises to see whether
the power was exercised. It may then be that some of
the franchises contain valid fare contracts, while others

do not. In that event, the relief to be granted will involve passing also on matters of detail.
In my opinion, these questions of statutory construction, and all matters of detail, should, in the first instance,
be decided by the trial court. To that end, the judgment
of the District Court should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, without costs to either
party in this Court. Pending the decision of the trial
court an interlocutory injunction should issue. Compare
City of Hammond v. Schappi Bus Lbe, 275 U. S. 164;
City of Hammond v. Farina Bus Line & Transportation
Co., 275 U. S. 173; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, 279 U. S. 813.
It is a serious task for us to construe and apply the written
law of California. Compare Gilchrist v. Interba'rough
Rapid Transit Co., 279 U. S. 159, 207-209. To "one
brought up within it, varying emphasis, tacit assumptions,
unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only
from life, may give to the different parts wholly new
values that logic and grammar never could have got from
the books." Diaz v. Gonzalez, 261 U. S. 10-2, 106. This
Court is not peculiarly fitted for that work. We may
properly postpone the irksome burden of examining the
many relevant state statutes and decisions until we shall
have had the aid which would be afforded by a thorough
consideration of them by the judges of the District Court,
who are presumably more familiar with the law of Cali.fornia than we are. The practice is one frequently followed by this Court.'

which a lower Federal court erroneously left undecided a question

of local law or of its application, Gainesville v. Brown-Crimmer Co.,

In the case at bar, there are persuasive reasons for
adopting the course suggested.. The subject matter of
this litigation is local to California. The parties are all
citizens of that State and creatures of its legislature.
Since the Railway denies that there ever was a valid contract governing the rate and asserts that if any such
existed they have been abrogated, the contract clause
of the Federal Constitution is not involved. The alleged
existence of contracts concerning the rate of fare presents

by the courts below; but it preferred to remand the cases for further
proceedings, either on the ground that the determination of the
undecided issues was too burdensome a task, or on the ground that
those issues should more appropriately be decided, in the first

the fundamental issue of the case. Whether such contracts exist, or ever existed, depends wholly upon the
construction to be given to laws of the State. Upon
these questions, the decision of the Supreme Court of
California would presumably have been accepted by
this Court, if the case had come here ol appeal from
it. Compare Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, 262
U. S. 432, 438; Appleby v. City of New York, 271 U. S.
364, 380.
The constitutional claim of confiscation gave jurisdiction to the District Court. We may be required, therefore, to pass, at some time, upon these questions of state
law. And we may do so' now. But the special province of
this Court is the Federal law. The construction and
application of the Constitution of the United
States and
of the legislation of Congress is its most important function. In order to give adequate consideration to the adjudication of great issues of government, it must, so far
as possible, lessen the burden incident to the disposition
of cases, which come here for review.'

I agree with Mr. Justice Brandeis that this case should
have been disposed of by remanding it to the district
court of three judges for determination whether the railway company, under its 102 franchises, or any of them,
is bound by contract to maintain a five-cent fate. That
question is I think different from the one presented in

involved in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens Railway Co., 184
U. S. 368; Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Water Works Co., 206
U. S. 496, whether the city had the requisite legislative
authority to bind itself, not to reduce the rate of fare
fixed by the franchise. Here concededly the power to
regulate rates is reserved to the state commission and
the question preliminary to the whole case is whether the
railroad company has bound itself to serve for a five-cent
fare. I know of no principle of the law of contracts, qua
contracts, which would preclude its doing so, even though
the city had no power to obligate itself to maintain any
particular rate. It has not purported to exercise such
power by so contracting. It had power to grant franchises and the grant of the franchise without more would
be good consideration for the company's undertaking
to maintain a five-cent fare. Williston on Contracts,
§§ 13, 140.
The provision of the statute bf April 7, 1913, enacted
after the decision in Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles,
supra, authorizing the city to grant franchises and "to
prescribe the terms and conditions" of the grant, and
that of the act of June. 8, 1915, authorizing the grantor of
the franchise to impose terms and conditions "whether
governmental or contractual in character," to quote no
others, would seem to permit the city to acquire by
the mere grant of the franchise, without other obligation on its part, such contractual undertakings on the part
of the railroad company as did not contravene the public
interest.
If there be any public policy forbidding the company
so to bind itself or forbidding the city to take advantage
of the undertaking so given and acquired, it is one peculiar to local law, having its origin in local history and conditions, and so is peculiarly an appropriate subject 'for
consideration, in the first instance, by the court, of the
district.

Syllabus.

But as the Court, without dealing with this aspect of
the matter, has held that the railway company is not
so bound, it' is unnecessary to decide that the state railroad commission's rcfusal to raise the rate would have
been enough to abrogate the contract, if there had been
one, and the practice of the Court not to pass on questions of constitutional or state law not necessary to a decision should, I think, be scrupulously observed. Even
if necessary to decide the question, I would not, be prepared to say that the refusal of the commission to fix a
fare different from the contract rate would destroy the
contract. By contracting for a five-cent fare, the railway
company waived the protection of the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Columbus Ry. Co. v. Columbus, 249 U. S. 399; Southern Iowa Electric Co. v.
Chariton, 255 U. S. 539, 542; Paducah v. Paducah Ry.

U. S. 432, 438; Henderson Water Co. v. CorporationCommission, 269 U. S. 278, 281. Granting that the contract
was subject to the power and duty of the commission to
modify it by changing the rate, that power has not been
exercised and the duty is one arising, not under the Constitution.and laws of the United States, but is imposed
by state statute, for breach of which a state remfedy alone
should be given. See Henderson Water Co. v. Corporation Commission, supra, 282 (compare Corporation Commission v. Henderson Water Co., 190 N. C. 70).
