order to protect a legal right of the plaintiff alleged to

repayment by carriers of amounts advanced in excess of the
guaranty; and (4) for loans to carriers, to meet their maturing
indebtedness or to provide equipment, etc., for the purpose of

JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
On July 26, 1923, the federal court for Minnesota appointed a receiver of The Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad upon a creditor's bill, which was later consolidated
with suits to foreclose its mortgages. The usual order
issued for proof of claims. The United States presei}ted
four claims arising under Title II of Transportation Act,
1920, February 28, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 457-469. As to
each laim -it asserted that, by § 3466 of the Revised
Statutes, U. S. C., Tit. 31, § 191, it was entitled to preference and priority over the claims of -all other creditors,
secured or unsecured. Opposing creditors conceded that
the Railroad was insolvent within the meaning of § 3466.
United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corporation, 269
U. S. 504. The insistence that the United States did
not have priority was rested, among other grounds, upon
the origin and character of its claims. The master and
the District Court denied the United States priority over
any creditor. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that
decree, but limited its decision to a denial of priority over
secured creditors and those whose claims were preferred
by local law or by the rule of Fosdick v. ,Schall, 99 U. S.
235. It did not consider the relation of the Government's
claims to those of general creditors, because it concluded
that the estate would not realize more than enough to
satisfy the secured and preferred creditors and because
general creditors were not parties to the appeal. 33 F.
(2d.) 533. A writ of certiorari was granted.
Title II of Transportation Act, 1920, comprising §§ 200
through 211, is headed "Termination of Federal Control."

UNITED STATES v. GUARANTY TR. CO.
478

Opinion of the Court.

Section 207 (pp. 462-3), provides that the " indebtedness
of each carrier to the United States, which may exist at
the ternination of Federal control, incurred for additions
and betterments made during Federal control and properly chargeable to capital account . . . shall, at the
request of the carrier, be funded for a period of ten years
from the termination of Federal control, or a shorter period at the option of the carrier "; and also that any other
then existing indebtedness to the United States should
be evidenced by notes payable in one year -from the
termination of Federal control, or less at the option of
the carrier. For both classes of debts, the carrier is to
pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum and, in
the discretion of the President, to give such security as
he may require.' Two of the claims of the United States
here in question are based on promissory notes made pursuant to this section. Each of the two notes is in the
amount of $625,000. One is dated May 27, 1922, and
is due March 1' 1930, ten years after termination of
Federal control; the other is dated April 1, 1923, and is
payable on demand. Each bears interest at 6 per cent.,
payable semi-annually, and is secured by a deposit of
the Company's Series A 50-year refunding and extension
mortgage bonds, dated January 1, 1912.
1See Report of Director General for the period December 31, 1921,
67th Cong., 2d Sess., H. R.. Doc. 1SO, p. 12: "The total amount
expended by the Railroad Administration for such additions and betterments aggregates $1,144,681,582.39. The Transportation Act of
1920 in Section 207, anticipated that the carriers might not be able
to pay out of the compensation and other sums due them from the
Government all the sums due the Government on account of capital
expenditure, and therefore provided that only so much of the indebtedness due from the United States to the carriers should be offset by the indebtedness due the United States from the carriers 'as
deemed wise by the President,' and further provided that any funding.obtained by the carriers should be granted only upon their giving security in such form and upon such terms as the President.may
prescribe

The third claim arose under § 209. That section (at
p. 466) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon
certification by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to
advance to any carrier, on account of the guaranty of
operating income there provided for the six months following the termination of Federal control, sums "necessary
to enable it to meet its fixed charges and operating expenses"-the advances to be "secured in such manner as
the Secretary may determine"; and provides for repayment by the carrier of any amount proved to have been
paid in excess of the guaranty. Compare Great Northern
Ry.v. United States, 277 U. S. 172. The amount claiined
by the United States under this section is $292,022.23,
which sum the Interstate Commerce Commission certified
had been advanced in excess of the guaranteed amount.
See Guaranty Settlement With Minneapolis & St. Louis
R. R., 86 I. C. C. 691.
The fourth claim arose under § 210, (p. 468). "For the
purpose of enabling carriers . . . properly to serve
the public during the transition period immediately following the termination of Federal control," that section,
as amended by Act of June 5, 1920, c. 235, § 5, 41 Stat.
874, 946, authorizes loans by the Government to carriers,
if a. loan is required by a carrier " to meet its maturing
indebtedness, or to provide itself with equipment or other
additions and betterments." The loans are to be made
only on security; for a period not in excess of'fifteen years;
and if application therefor is made to the Interstate Commerce Commission within two years from the termination
of Federal control. And no loan can be made, unless the
Commission first finds and certifies that the loan is necessary to enable the applicant to meet the transportation
needs of the public; " that the prospective earning power
of the applicant and the character and value of the security offered are such as to furnish reasonable assurance
of the applicant's ability to repay the loan within the timb

fixed therefor, and to meet its other obligations in connection with such loan . . . and that the applicant
is unable to provide itself with the funds necessary for the aforesaid purposes from other sources." The
claim under this section is on a promissory note for $1,382,000 dated April 1, 1921, which was given in consideration of a loan of that amount, made to enable the Comipany to pay a maturing issue of its outstanding mortgage
bonds. The note is payable in ten years, with intercst
semi-annually at the rate of 6 per cent., and is secured
by a deposit of the Company's Series A, 50-year refunding
and extension mortgage bonds. dated January 1, 1912.

362.
The alleged priority of the United States under § 3466
over mortgages and over unsecured claims preferred by
local law (compare Spokane County v. United States, 279
U. S.80,) or by the rule of Fosdick v. Schall, supra, was
discussed in the lower courts and was argued by counsel
before this Court. But we have no occasion to consider
these questions. For, we are of opinion that it was the
purpose of Congress that § 3466 should not apply to any
indebtedness of the railroads to the United States arising
under §§ 207, 209 or 210 of Transportation Act, 1920.
During Federal control, the Government had been
obliged to-provide most of the new capital required for
equipment, improvements and extensions, 2 and some of the
funds needed to meet current interest and dividend payments. The Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25,
2 See note 1, supra.
Of the amount expended for these purposes
during Federal control only $140,000,000, approximately, was paid
through funds raised by the companies. Report of the Director
General to the President'for fourteen months ended March 1, 1920

§ 6, 40 Stat. 451, 455, appropriated $500,000,000 " to be
used by the President as a revolving fund for the purpose,"
among other things, of providing " terminals, motive
power, cars, and other necessary equipment." The Act
of June 30, 1919, c. 5, 41 Stat. 34, appropriated $750,000,000 more. The Transportation Act, 1920, §§ 202 and
210, made a similar provision in appropriating for the purposes of Title II, $500,000,000; in addition to the sums
otherwise available ant! in addition to the general appropriations made in §§ 204 (g) and 209 (g), (h) and (i).
-. These appropriations were made in order to meet a
pressing need. At the time of the passage of Transportation Act, 1920, most of the railroads of the United States
lacked funds for necessary improvements, equipment, and
expansion of facilities. Some of the carriers needed funds,
also, to meet maturing obligations. The credit of many
carriers was ser'ous]y impaired. There was & general reluctance among investors to purchase new railroad securities even of the strongest railroads. Congress deemed it
impo'rtant to preserve for the nation su',stantially the
whole existing transportation system. Compare New
England Divisions.Case, 261 U. S. 184, 190. In order to
accomplish this, it was thought necessary that the United

(WpllioI,

'l.

States should, to a certain exteut, finance the carriers until
it would become possible to restore their credit, by increase
of rates or otherwise. The provisions of Title II of Transportation Act, 1920, were framed to that end. Through
them, the financial aid .which had been given during Federal control was to be extended for a further period.
To have given priority to debts due the United States
pursuant to Title II, would have defeated the purpose of
Congress. It not only.would have prevented the re~stablishment of railroad credit among bankers and investors,
but it would even have seriously impaired the market
value of outstanding railroad securities. It would have
deprived the carriers of the credit commonly enjoyed
from supplymen and others; would have seriously embarrassed the carriers in their daily operations; and would
have made necessary a great enlargement of their working
capital. The provision for loans under § 210 would have
been frustrated. For, carriers could ill afford voluntarily
to contract new debts thereunder which would displace,
pro tanto, their existing bonded indebtedness. The entire spirit of the Act makes clear the purpose that the
rule leading to such consequences should not be applied.
Moreover, Congress evidenced unmistakably its purpose to rely, for obtaining payment of the Government's
advances, upon means other than the priority provided
for by § 3466. Under all of the sections, the giving of
adequate security was either required or left to the discretion of the President. Under § 210 no advance could
be made, unless the Interstate Commerce Commission
was satisfied that the earning power of the carrier and
the security given furnished reasonable assurance that the
loan would be repaid and all obligations in connection
therewith would be performed.4 The interest rate re4 In some instances the Commission has authorized security which

quired is much greater than that which ordinarily accompanies even a business loan carrying such assurance of
repayment as would have resulted from an application of
the priority rule. Thus, both the general purposes of
Title II and its specific provisions make it clear that Congress intended to exclude -the indebtedness so arising from
the scope of § 3466 of the Revised Statutes, just as under
the Federal Control Act it had excluded therefrom claims
incident to current operation of the railroads. Mellon v.

1. In an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act for a death
alleged to htve resulted from the negligent failure of the employer
to furnish a safe place to work, the plaintiff has the burden of
proving that the accident was proximately due to the negligence
of the employer, and a verdict resting upon speculation and conjecture can not be sustained. P. 489.
2. In an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a showing that the accident may have resulted from one of several causes,
for some of which the defendant was responsible, and for some
of which it was not, is not sufficient to establish liability. P. 490.
3. Liability under the rule which requires the master to use reasonable care to furnish a safe place to work ceases when the servant
