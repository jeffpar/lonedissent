Syllabus.

termination by law as an evil of a business otherwise
flourishing, and neither becomes more applicable because
the death is lingering rather than instantaneous. It is
incredible that Congress by an Act approved on February
24, 1919, should have meant to enable parties to cut down
their taxes on such grounds because of an amendment to
the Constitution that it had submitted to the legislatures
of the States in 1917 and that had been ratified by the
legislatures of a sufficient number of States the month
before the present Act was passed.
Judgment reversed.

RENZIEHAUSEN v. LUCAS, COMMISSIONER OF
INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF -APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 114.

Argued January 17, 1930.-Decided January 27, 1930.

1. Under § 214 (a) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1918 and § 214 (a)
(8) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which provide that in computing
net income there shall be allowed as deductions to individuals
"a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of
property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable
allowance for obsolescence," the owner of a distillery and wholesale
liquor business is not entitled to a deduction for the "exhaustion"
or "obsolescence" of good will-treated as embracing trade-marks,
trade brands and trade names-during the years 1918, 1919, 1920,
and 1922, because of federal legislation which proscribed the
business. Following Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing
Co., ante, p. 384. P. 389.
2. Whether, under § 214 (a) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1918, which
provides that in computing net income there shall be allowed as
deductions "losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, if incurred in trade or

business," the owner of a distillery and wholesale liquor business
terminated by federal prohibition legislation is entitled to a deduction on account of the loss of good will,--not decided, in absence
of evidence sufficient to support the claim. P. 3S9.
3. Where the owner of a distilling company at the close of each distilling season charged to a special account which he regarded as
a personal investment, all whiskey manufactured and not sold,
selling it to the trade after two years when it had matured, the
whiskey is properly regarded as a part of the stock in trade of the
business, and the owner is not entitled to the more favorable rate
allowed by the Revenue Act of 1921, § 206 (a) (6), for taxes on
capital gain. P. 389.

delivered

the opinion of the

Court.
This case raises the same questions as the preceding
one, Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co., ante,

p. 384, but was decided the other way. 31 F. (2d) 675. A
writ, of certiorari was granted by this court on October 14,
1929.
The good will here concerned, (treated as embracing
trade-marks, trade brands and trade names,) was that of
a business of distilling and selling whiskey, warehousing,
and a wholesale liquor business. The Board of Tax Appeals adjudged a deficiency in the petitioner's income tax
returns for 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1922. A deduction is

claimed by him, as in the other case, for exhaustion or
obsolescence of the good will, under the Revenue Act of
1918, (Act of February 24, 1919,) c. 18, § 214 (a) (8); 40
Stat. 1057, 1067, using the same words for individuals that
are used in § 234 for corporations, and under the Revenue
Act of 1921, (Act of November 23, 1921,) c. 136, § 214
(a) (8); 42 Stat. 227, 240, using the same words again.
What has been said in the Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co.'s case is sufficient to dispose of this one, and here
there is the additional fact that in 1919 the petitioner

became aware that he could manufacture whiskey for
medicinal purposes and did so until the Willis-Campbell
Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134; 42 Stat. 222, was
passed and the petitioner failed to obtain a permit under
it. The evidence does not seem to warrant an alternative claim under the Revenue Act of 1918, § 214 (a)
(4), for losses incurred in business in 1919, even if otherwise it could be sustained.
The only other question that seems to need mention
is raised by an account headed " Old Whiskey," on the
books of the Large Distilling Company, under which
name the petitioner did the distilling business. At the
close of each distilling season the whiskey manufactured
and not sold was charged to this account, matured and
sold to the trade. The petitioner regarded this .whiskey
as a personal investment, but the whole business was his,
and we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the
whiskey was clearly a part of the stock in trade, and
therefore that he was not .entitled to the more favorable
rate allowed by the Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136,
§ 206 (6), for taxes on capital gain, excluding stock in
trade. The petitioner has no reason to complain of the
allowance for obsolescence of the warehouses.
Decree affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS and MR. JUSTICE STONE

concur in the result.
