them said: "That question is based upon Mrs. Spalding's
one-sixth ownership of a lease at 25 cents per ton. That
question is anentirely different one from the one asked
me by Mr. Zane. It would require a good deal of calculation and certain assumptions as to how fast that ore

by a state commission and has been accepted by it and by.the

whether rates fixed by the, commission allow a
quate return upon that valuation, objections

2. The property of a public utility, although devoted to the public
service and impressed with a public interest; is still private property; and neither the corpus of that property nor the use thereof

constitutionally can be taken for a compulsory price which falls
below the measure of just compensation. One is confiscation no
less than the other. P. 249.
3. What is a fair return within this principle cannot be settled by
invoking decisions of this Court made years ago based upon conditions radically different from those which prevail today. The
problem is one to be tested primarily by present day conditions. Id.
4. It is common knowledge that annual returns upon capital' and
enterprise, like wages of employees, cost of maintenance and related
expenses, have materially increased the country over, so that a rate
of return upon capital invested in street railway lines and other
public utilities which might have been proper a few years ago no
longer furnishes a safe criterion either for the present or the future.
Id.
5. Nor can a rule fixing a rate of fair return be laid down which will
apply uniformly to all sorts of utilities. What may be a fair return
for one may be inadequate for another, depending upon circumstances, locality and risk. Id.
6. What will constitute a fair return in a given case is not capable of
exact mathematical demonstration. It is a matter more or less
of approximation about which conclusions may differ. The court
in the discharge of its constitutional duty on the issue of confiscation must determine the amount to the best of its ability in the
exercise of a fair, enlightened and independent judgment as to
both law and facts. P. 251."
7. Just compensation for a utility, requiring for efficient public service skillful and prudent management as well as use of the plant,
and whose rates are subject to public regulation, is more than current interest on mere investment. Sound business management
requires that after paying all expenses of operation, setting aside the
necessary sums for depreciation, payment of interest and reasonable
dividends, there should still remain- something to be passed to the
surplus account; and a rate of return which does not admit of that
being done is not sufficient to assure confidence in the financial
soundness of the utility to maintain its credit and enable it to raise
money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.
P. 251.
8. In the present case, a return of less than 7.44%, the rate sought
by the utility, would be confiscatory. P. 252.
9. Regulation of a state commission requiring a street railway company to abolish a second fare zone applied to a suburban extension

not subject to constitutional objection if the extension be an
integral part of the railway system and if fares be so readjusted
as to yield a fair return upon the property as a whole. P. 252.
10. In reaching its judgment sustaining rates fixed by a state commission, the state court ruled with the public utility and against
the commission on the amount to be allowed the utility for annual
depreciation, but against the utility on the adequacy of the rates.
The utility appealed on the ground that the return yielded by the
rates was inadequate and the commission took a cross-appeal and
applied for certiorari on the ground that the allowance for depreciation was erroneous. Held that the ruling on the depreciation
allowance could properly be reviewed in connection with the
utility's appeal and that the petition for certiorari and the question
of this Court's jurisdiction over the cross-appeal need not be
considered. P. 253.
11. In determining adequate rates for a public utility, the allowances
for annual depreciation must be based, not upon cost, but upon
present value. P. 253.

For some years street railway properties have not generally been earning eight per cent. Consequently street
railways have not been and are not being built to any
extent. The return earned has not generally been equal
to that generally made at the same time and in the same
general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding
risks and uncertainties, and such companies have not
been able to compete successfully for capital with other
lines of industry.
In many respects the condition and the credit of
street railway companies are worse than they were before
the war-worse even in 1927 than in 1922. Since July 1,
1920, the average cost to the Company of borrowed money
(other than current bank loans)-more than $18,000,000

238

280 U. S.

in the aggregate-was 7.23 per cent, the lowest 6.6 per
cent, the last 7.32 per cent. This experience is quite in
line with the general situation of street railways, though
not of other business generally. As Judge Parke says:
"It. would seem inevitable that a fair return on the property should be more than the cost of money obtained
through the sale of bonds'and other securities. McCardle
v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U. S. 400, 419, 420. The
clear and convincing testimony in this case is that a basic
rate of 6.26 per centum is not a fair return upon the
property used, nor sufficient to enable the utility to maintain its credit or to secure its necessary capital at
a reasonable cost." 155 Md. 612.
That a utility's right to a fair return may be lost by
forbearance-or, if you will, delay-in asserting it, is the
opposite of established doctrine. By enjoying inadequate
rates too long, the public can not acquire a right to continue
such rates still longer. On the contrary, under the decisions
of this Court, the question is, not whether the utility has
delayed too long before attacking a confiscatory rate, but
whether it has waited long enough to make it reasonably
clear that the rate will actually prove to be confiscatory.
Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1; Willcox v.
Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19; Pennsylvania R. Co.
v. Public Service Comm'n, 126 Md. 59. It is not for the
public to complain that the Company did not assert its
rights sooner.
II. The Company's annual depreciation allowance is
properly based on present value, not on cost, of its depreciable property.
On this question the Court of Appeals in effect holds
that to base depreciation allowance on cost, instead of
presepit value, is not only contrary to the Federal Constitution, and therefore contrary to the similar provisions of
the Maryland, Constitution; but also unreasonable, i. e.,

UNITED RAILWAYS v. WEST.
234

Argument for the Company.

contrary to the state statute (Public Service Comm'n
Law, § 43).
The Company "is entitled to see that from earnings the
value of the property invested is kept unimpaired."
Knoxville v. Water Co., supra, at p. 13.
"Investment" refers to "property invested," not to the
money originally invested in the property. That is to say,
"investment" is used in the sense of "that in which
money is laid out or invested" (Century Dictionary) and
not (as in the term "prudent investment ") in the very
recent special sense of cost as distinguished from value.
At the moment when Mr. Justice Brandeis' dissenting
opinion (Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Service
Comm'n, 262 U. S. 276) had brought the term "prudent
investment " into vogue, this Court again used "investment" in the old sense, viz., "a fair and reasonable return
on the capital investment-the value of the property."
Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 262 U. S. 679.
However annual depreciation allowance is computedwhether directly as a percentage of property or indirectly
by reference to gross earnings or otherwise-unless it
fairly provides for return of property, i. t., value, the utility's constitutional rights are invaded. The law knows
but one " rate base,"-not one for return of property and
another for return on property. Unless rates are sufficient
to yield both returns, property is confiscated.
None of the Justices has ever expressed an opinion that
there could be one rate base, viz., value, for return on
property and another, viz., cost, for depreciation, i. e.,
return of property. On the contrary, Mr. Justice Brandeis
in his dissenting opinions has mentioned modern accounting (Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,
262 U. S. 309)-and particularly depreciation accounting
(Pacific Gas Co. v. San Francisco, 265 U. S. 403)-as advantages of adopting "prudent investment" as the "rate

240

Argument for the Company.

280 U. S.

base." His opinions do not suggest that "prudent investment," i. e., cost, not value, already is the "rate base"
for depreciation allowance, though not for fair return on
property.
Whenever cost is material, e. g., when depreciation is
computed for income tax purposes (cost being the statutory basis for computing' taxable gain), then accounting
rules and methods may furnish means for determining
such cost-and such depreciation on such a cost basis.,
United States v. Ludey, 274 U. S. 295. So too, as was remarked by Judge Rose in lankuage quoted by Judge Ulman, "in the absence of great changes in value" book
cost "would be a fairly accurate measure for present
value." Chesapeake & P. Tel. Co. v. Whitman, 3 F. (2d)
938. In other words, whenever in fact cost and value are
not, materially different in amount, then book cost
(though not material as such) may conveniently and with
approximate accuracy be used as evidence of value.
Board of Comm'rs v. N. Y. Tel. Co., 271 U. S.23. When,
however, cost is not material but value is, and in fact
cost and value are materially different in amount, then
accounting rules and methods concerning cost will not
determine value or depreciation in value. The Constitution, law, and facts can not be changed by, or subordinated to, methods and convenience of accounting.
There is no judicial authority for such subordination of
law to accounting, and establishment of two rate bases,
value for return on property, cost for return of property,
except a master's report in Georgia Ry. & P. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, P U. R. 1925 A, 546. In this respect the
master's report is contrary to the clear implication
of the
previous language of this Court in the same case. The
very fact that several commissions-by no means all
(Cincinnati & Suburban Bell Tel. Co., P. U. R. 1924 E,
849)-have held otherwise, and that convenience is a
temptation to subordinate law to accounting, only em-

phasizes the lack of judicial support for so convenient a
form of confiscation.
III. The abolition of the second fare to Halethorpe is
unconstitutional and confiscatory.
Though exceptional circumstances, e. g., a long established status quo, may justify an unremunerative rate for
part of a street railway system when rates as a whole are
remunerative (Puget Sound Traction Co. v. Reynolds, 244
U. S. 574), gratuitous service can not be required and
unremunerative rates can not arbitrarily be made still
more unremunerative. On the contrary, the general rule
is that a street railway, like other utilities, is entitled to
substantial compensation for each part of its business.
Banton v. Belt Line Ry., 268 U. S. 413; Chicago, M. & St.
P. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 274 U. S. 344.
The fact that a railroad company voluntarily established and continues unremunerative commutation rates
to a certain suburban point on its line does not justify a
commission in requiring the establishment of unremunerative commutation rates to more distant points on the
same line. A commission order requiring sUch extension
of commutation rates deprives the railroad company of
property without due process of law. Public Service

The burden is on the Company to show that the action
of the Commission, upheld by the Court of Appeals, in its
final result and as a reality is necessarily confiscatory of its
property under the rules of federal law. To succeed it
must present a record here which shows that the rate of
return, when applied to a rate base arrived at in accordance with federal
law, would be confiscatory. Under the

rules sanctioned by this Court in confiscation cases, a
value much lower than that found by the Commission
under Maryland law would have resulted. It is our contention, therefore, that though the Commission established the value it did in accordance with Maryland law,
it did so without giving consideration to the loss of value
resulting from loss of traffic due to automobile competition, but did consider and give effect to this factor when
fixing the rate of return. In this Court, therefore, the
Company must show, but has failed to show, that the
result of this action by the Commission necessarily results
in the confiscation of its property. The Company can not
have at one and the same time state law as to value and
federal law as to rate of return. This Court should therefore affirm the decree on the Company's appeal, even
though it may .consider a rate of retu'rn of 6.26 per cent.
tooloW, because this record on the one hand discloses that
the actual return permitted the Company would constitute a much higher percentage of a rate base arriv.ed at
by the application of federal rules, and on the other hand
does not negative the presumption that so regarded it
would constitute so high a percentage of a federal rate
bAse as to meet this Court's approval.
The Commission was compelled by the ruling of the
Court of Appeals in this case to fix the depreciation allowance on value instead of on cost. We contend that this
view of the Court of Appeals is erroneous and contrary to
the doctrine of this Court, and that consequently the
Company is now permitted, under the rates of fare fixed
by the Commission, to collect an annual sum for depreciation much in excess of that required to make good
the depreciation in fact suffered by it.
In United States v. Ludey, 274 U. S. 295, this Court
considered the question of the basis on which to calculate, under the income tax law, the profit realized upon
a sale of property. It was held that the annual depreci-

UNITED RAILWAYS v. WEST.
234

Argument for the Commission.

ation must be deducted from the original cost (or the
value, if higher than cost, of that acquired before 1913)
in order to ascertain the cost of the property sold. The
property in question in the case consisted, besides mining
equipment, in part of oil land. No distinction, however,
was made between such property and that used in any
other business. The rule thus announced by this Court
is the rule universally followed and practiced by accountants. It is no mere bookkeeping formula, but is a rule of
substance.
The practice of commissions has been to base depreciation on cost. Missouri U. Tel. Co., P. U. R. 1926 A,

443; Georgia R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'in 262 U. S.625.
Various expressions in the opinions in these cases were
seized upon and claimed to sustain the Company's position. In no one of thema was there any discussion of the
point. We submit that it can not now be asserted that

280 U. S.

a question of law has been foreclosed by
so
thisimportant
Court without
discussion. On the contrary, we submit that the Knoxville case is authority for our position.
There this Court speaks of the duty of a public utility
company to make an annual depreciation charge so that it
shall keep "the investment unimpaired." Furthermore,
the question there at issue was whether in fixing the value
of a plant the Company was entitled to add to the rate
base certain amounts for so-called complete and incomplete depreciation which had not in fact been taken by
it in the past. This claim was rejected.
The real rate of return received by the Company is
greater than 6.26 per cent., but even if this is not so, the
Company has not met the burden of showing that such
rate is confiscatory, when the question is considered with
relation to all relevant facts.
There was ample evidence to sustain the finding of the
Commission that a rate of return of 6.26 per cent. is
reasonable.
The most recent cases show a strong tendency to approve rates of return lower than the rates held reasonable
during the period following the World War. Galveston
Elec. Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388; Greencastle Water
Works v. Public Service Comm'n, 31 F. (2d) 600; Cambridge Elec. L. Co. v. Atwill, 25 F. (2d) 485; Chesapeake
& P. Tel. Co. v. Virginia, 147 Va. 43;'Chesapeake & P.
Tel. Co. v. Whitman, 3 F. (2d) 938.
In the court below the Company relied strongly on a
series of cases dealing (with one exception, a telephone
company) with gas ' ompanies, located in or near New
York City, wherein ret:,rns of 8 per cent. were allowed.
The period of time embraced in those decisions was from
1924 to 1926. In none of the cases did this Court rule that
a return of less than 8 per cent. was confiscatory.
This Court has laid down no unvarying rule that any
specific rate of, return is necessary to avoid confiscation,

Opinion of the Court.

MR.JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The first of these titles (No. 55) is an appeal, and the
second (No. 64), a cross-appeal, from a decree of the
Court of Appeals of Maryland. The case arose from an
order of the state Public Service Commission limiting the
rate of passenger fares to be,charged by the United Railways and Electric Company for carrying passengers over
its lines in the City of Baltimore. The company, by -its
appeal, attacks the commission's order as confiscatory.
The cross-appeal seeks to raise the question whether, the
amount for annual depreciation allowed the company
should be calculated upon the present value of the company's property or upon its cost.
Upon application of the company to the commission,
made in 1927,. for an increase in fares, the commission
passed an order making an increase, but not to the extent
sought. Thereupon, suit was brought in a state circuit
court on the grounds that the rate fixed by the commission was confiscatory and that the annual allowance for
depreciation was calculated upon a wrong basis, namely,
upon cost, instead of present value of depreciable property. The circuit court, in an able opinion, sustained
the company upon both grounds, and enjoined the enforcement of the commission's order. On appeal, the
court of appeals upheld the view of the circuit court in
respect of depreciation, but held the rate of return not
confiscatory. 155 Md. 572. Thereupon, the commission
increased the depreciation allowance in accordance with
the decree of the court and adjusted the rate of fare to
the extent necessary to absorb the increased allowance.
A second suit and an appeal to the court of appeals followed, and that court entered a decree, 157 Md. 70,
sustaining the action of the commission; and it is that
decree which is here for review.

The facts, so far as we find it necessary to review them,
are not in dispute. The company since 1899 has owned
and operated all the street railway lines in the City of
Baltimore. Its present capital structure consists of
$24,000,000 of common stock, $38,000,000 of ordinary
bonded indebtedness, and $14,000,000 of perpetual income bonds redeemable at the option of the company
after 1949. Due to the increased use of automobiles, the
total number of passengers carried has for some time
steadily decreased, while the number carried during the
"rush hours" has increased. This has resulted in an
increase of expenses in proportion to the whole number
of passengers carried, since equipment, etc., must be
maintained and men employed sufficient to care for the
increased business of the "rush hours," notwithstanding
their reduced productiveness during the hours of decreased business. Since the war operating expenses have
almost if not quite doubled.
The present value of the property used was fixed by
the commission at $75,000,000, and this amount was accepted without question by both parties in the state circuit court and in the court of appeals. Included in this
valuation is $5,000,000 for easements in the streets of
Baltimore. The court of appeals had held in another and
earlier cse, Miles v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 151 Md. 337,
that the easements constituted an interest in real estate
and that in making up the rate base their value should
be included. The commission in the present case, accordingly, included the amount in the valuation and made
no 'attack upon the item in the courts below, where it
passed as a matter not iit dispute. The item is now
challenged by counsel for the commission in this Court,
and other objections to the \valuation are suggested, likewise for the first time. We do not find it necessary to
consider this challenge or these objections, for, if they

ever possessed substance, they come too late. In the
further consideration of the case, therefore, we accept,
for all purposes, the valuation of $75,000,000 as it was
accepted and acted upon by parties, commission and
courts below.
The commission fixed a rate of fare permitting the company to earn a return of 6.26 per cent. on this valuation;
and, so far as No. 55 is concerned, the case resolves itself
into the simple question whether that return is so inadequate as to result in a deprivation of property in violation
of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In answering that question, the fundamental
principle to be observed is that the property of a public
utility, although devoted to the public service and impressed with a public interest, is still private property;
and neither the corpus of that property nor the use thereof
constitutionally can be taken for a compulsory price
which falls below the measure of just compensation. One'
is confiscation no less than the other.
What is a fair return within this principle cannot be
settled by invoking decisions of this Court made years
ago based upon conditions radically different from those
which prevail today. The problem is one to be tested
primarily by present day conditions. Annual returns upon
capital and enterprise, like wages of employees, cost of
maintenance and related expenses, have materially in-,
creased the country over. This is common knowledge.
A rate of return upon capital invested in street railway
lines and other public utilities which might have been
proper a few years ago no longer furnishes a safe criterion
either for the present or the future. Lincoln Gas Co. v.
Lincoln, 250 U. S. 256, 268. Nor can a rule be laid down
which will apply uniformly to all sorts of utilities. What
may be a fair return for one may be inadequate for another, depending upon circumstances, locality and risk.

Willcox v. ConsolidatedGas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 48-50. The
general rule recently has been stated in Bluefield Co. v.
Pub. Serv. Comm., 262 U. S. 679, 692-695:
"What annual rate will constitute just compensation
depends upon many circumstances and must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment,
having regard to all relevant facts. A public utility is
entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return
on the value of the property which it employs for the
convenience of the public equal to that generally being
made at the same time and in the same general part of
the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits
such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable
enterprises or speculative ventures. The return should be
reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial
soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under
efficient and economical management, to maintain and
support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. A rate
of return may be reasonable at one time and become too
high or too low by changes affecting opportunities for
investment, the money market and business conditions
generally.
"Investors take into account the result of past operations, especially in recent years, when determining the
terms upon which they will invest in such an undertaking. Low, uncertain or irregular income makes for low
prices for the securities of the utility and higher rates of
interest to be demanded by investors. The fact that the
company may not insist as a matter of constitutional
right that past losses be made up by rates to be applied
in- the present and future tends to weaken credit, and the
fact that the utility is protected against being compelled

234

Opinion of the Court.

to serve for confiscatory rates tends to support it. In
this case the record. shows that the rate of return has been
low through a long period up to the time of the inquiry
by the commission here involved."
What will constitute a fair return in a given case is not
capable of exact mathematical demonstration. It is a
matter more or less of approximation about which conclusions may differ. The court in the discharge of its
constitutional duty on the issue of confiscation must determine the amount to the best of its ability in the exercise
of a fair, enlightened and "independent judgment as to
both law and facts." Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben .Avon
Borough, 253 U. S.287, 289; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv.
Comm., supra, pp. 689, 692; Lehigh Valley R. R. v.
Commissioners, 278 U. S.24, 36.
There is much evidence in the record to the effect that
in order to induce the investment of capital in the enterprise or to enable the company to compete successfully
in the market for money to finance its operations, a net
return upon the valuation fixed by the commission should
be not far from 8 per cent. Since 1920 the company has
borrowed from time to time some $18,000,000, upon which
it has been obliged to pay an average rate of interest ranging well over 7 per cent., and this has been the experience
of street railway lines quite generally. Upon the valuation fixed, with an allowance for depreciation calculated
with reference to that valuation, and upon the then prescribed rates, the company for the years 1920 to 1926,
both inclusive, obtained a return of little more than 5 per
cent. per annum. It is manifest that just compensation
for a utility, requiring for efficient public service skillful
and prudent management as well as use of the plant, and
whose rates are subject to public regulation, is more
than current interest on mere investment. Sound business management requires that after paying all expenses
of operation, setting aside the necessary sums for depre-

ciation, payment of interest and reasonable dividends,
there should still remain something to be passed to the
surplus account; and a rate of return which does not
admit of that being done is not sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility to maintain its credit and enable it to raise money necessary for
the proper discharge of its public duties. In this view of
the matter, a return of 6.26 per cent. is clearly inadequate.
In the light of recent decisions of this Court and other
Federal decisions, it is not certain that rates securing a
return of 71/2 per cent. or even 8 per cent. on the value
of the property would not be necessary to avoid confiscation.1 But this we need not decide, since the company itself sought from the commission a rate which it
appears would produce a return of about 7.44 per cent., at
the same time insisting that such return fell short of being
adequate. Upon the present record, we are of opinion that
to enforce rates producing less than this would be confiscatory and in violation of the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
Complaint also is made of the action of the commission
in abblishing the second fare zone established by the

company on what is called the Halethorpe line and substituting a single fare for the two fares theretofore exacted. Halethorpe is an unincorporated community lying outside the limits of Baltimore city. With a single
fare, the extension of the line to Halethorpe is not profitable, but, nevertheless, it is an integral part of the railway system, and it will be enough if the commission shall
so readjust the fares as to yield a fair return upon the
property, including the Halethorpe line, as a whole. If,
in doing so, the commission shall choose, not to restore
the :second fare, but to retain in force the single fare, we
perceive no constitutional objection.
The commission sought a review of the question in
respect of the annual depreciation allowance, both by a
cross-appeal and, later, by petition for certiorari. The
question of jurisdiction on the cross-appeal as well as
the consideration of the petition for certiorari was postponed to the hearing on the merits. We do not now find
it necessary to decide either matter. As the amount of
depreciation to be allowed was contested throughout, is
a necessary element to be determined in fixing the rate
of fare and is closely related in substance to the case
brought here by the company's appeal, it well may be
considered in connection therewith. In these circumstances neither cross-appeal nor certiorari is necessary
to present the question.
The allowance for annual depreciation made by the
commission was based upon cost. The court of appeals
held that this was erroneous and that it should have been
based upon present value. The court's view of the matter was plainly right. One of the items of expense to be
ascertained and deducted is the amount necessary to
restore property worn out or impaired, so as continuously
to maintain it as nearly as practicable at the same level
of efficiency for the public service. The amount set aside

periodically for this purpose is the so-called depreciation
allowance. Manifestly, this allowance cannot be limited
by the original cost, because, if values have advanced,
the allowance is not sufficient to maintain the level of
efficiency. The utility "is entitled to see that from earnings the value of the property invested is kept unimpaired, so that at the end of any given term of years the
original investment remains as it was at the beginning."
Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 13-14.
This naturally calls for expenditures equal to the cost
of the worn out equipment at the time of replacement;
and this, for all practical purposes, means present value.
It is the settled rule of this Court that the rate base is
present value, and it would be wholly illogical to adopt
a different rule for depreciation. A's the Supreme Court
of Michigan, in Utilities Commission v. Telephone Co.,
228 Mich. 658, 666, has aptly said: "If the rate base is
present fair value, then the depreciation base as to depreciable property is the same thing. There is no principle to sustain a holding that a utility may earn on the
present fair value of its property devoted to public service, but that it must accept and the public must pay depreciation on book cost or investment cost regardless of
present fair value. We repeat, the purpose of permitting a depreciation charge is to compensate the utility
for property consumed in service, and the duty of the
commission, guided by experience in rate making, is to
spread this charge fairly over the years of the life of the
property." And see Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub.
Serv. Comm., 262 U. S. 276, 288; Georgia Railway & P.
Co. v. Railroad Commission, 262 U. S. 625, 633.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

dissenting.

Acting under the direction of the Court of Appeals,
Public Service Commission v. United Railways & Electric
Co., 155 Md. 572, the Commission entered, on November
28, 1928, an order permitting the Railways to increase its
rate of fare to 10 cents cash, four tokens for 35 cents.1
That order was sustained in United Railways & Electric
Co. v. West, 157 Md. 70, and the Railways has appealed
to this Court. The claim is that the order confiscates its
property because the fare fixed will yield, according to
the estimates, no more than 6.26 per cent. upon the
assumed value. There are several reasons why I think the
order should be held valid.
A net return of 6.26 per cent. upon the present value
of the property of a street railway enjoying a monopoly
in one of the oldest, largest and richest cities on the Atlantic Seaboad .w ould seem to be compensatory. Moreover, the estimated return is in fact much larger, if the
rate of fare on the Railways' lines had been 5 cents until
1918. Then it applied for authority to increase its fares,,' purely as
a war emergency and during the period of war conditions ". Six
increases have since been granted: to 6 cents on January 7, '1919, Re
United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1919C, 7; to 7 cents cash, four
tokens for 26 cents, on September 30, 1919, Re United Rys. & Elec.
Co., P. U. R. 1920A, 1; to-a flat 7 cents on December 31, 1919, Re
United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1920A, 995; to 8 cents, two tokens
for 15 cents, on May 26, 1924, Re United Rys. & Elec.'Co., P. U. R.
1924D, 713. .T-Jiis was the rate of fare when, on August 1, 1927, the
Railways filed with the Commission the present application for a flat
10 cent fare. In its original decision thereon the Commission authorized a fare of 9 cents cash, three tokens for 25 cents, Re United
Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1928C, 604. To provide the additional
revenue required by the decision of the Court of Appeals concerning
depreciation, the Commission then raised the fare to 10 cents cash,
four tokens for 35 cents, Re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1929A,
180. The Railways is still seeking to secure a flat 10 cent fare.
The Railways had by order of the Commission been protected from
jitney competition. See P. U. R. 1928C, 604, 632.

rules which I deem applicable are followed. It is 6.70
per cent. if, in valuing the rate base, the prevailing rule
which eliminates franchises from a rate base is applied.
And it is 7.78 per cent. if also, in lieu of the deduction for
depreciation ordered by the Court of Appeals, the amount
is fixed, either by the method of an annual depreciation
charge computed according to the rules commonly applied in business, or by some alternative method, at the
sum which the long experience of this railway proves to
have been adequate for it.
First. The value of the plant adopted by the Commission as the rate base was fixed by it at $75,000,000 in a
separate valuation case, decided on March 9, 1926, modified, pursuant to directions of the Court of Appeals, 2 on
February 1, 1928, and not before us for review, Re United
Railways & Electric Co., P. U. R. 1926C, 441, P. U. R.
1928B, 737. Included in this total is $5,000,000 representing the value placed upon the Railways' so-called
"easements." If they are excluded, the estimated yield
found by the Commission would be increased by .44 per
cent. That is, the :,et earnings, estimated at $4,691,606
would yield, on a $70,000,000 rate base, 6.70 per cent.
The People's Counsel contended that since these "easements" are merely the privileges gratuitously granted to
the Railways by various county and municipal franchises
to lay tracks and operate street cars on the public highways,' they should be excluded from the rate base when
considering whether the order is confiscatory in violation
of the Federal Constitution. This alleged error of federal
law in the valuation may be considered on this appeal.
For, the rate allowed by the Commission is attacked on
the assumption that the return on the property is only

small part of these "easements" are privileges granted by franchises to operate street cars on portions of the streets which the public
uses only at intersections with other streets.

Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435; Union Tool Co. v. Wilson,
259 U. S. 107, 111.
Where a rate order is alleged to be void under the Federal Constitution because confiscatory, the question
whether a specific class of property should be included in
the rate base is to be determined not by the state law,
but by the federal law. Whether the return is sufficient
under the state law is a question which does not concern
us. We are concerned solely with the adequacy or inadequacy of the return under the guarantees of the federal
law. In determining whether a prescribed rate is confiscatory under the Federal Constitution, franchises are
not to be included in valuing the plant, except for such
amounts as were actually paid to the State, or a, political
subdivision thereof, as consideration for the grant. Cedar

the use of which profit may be made. They are privileges granted to utilities to enable them to employ their

property in the public service and make profit out of such
use of that property. As stated in the New Hampshire
statute, " all such franchises, rights and privileges being
granted in the public interest only" are "not justly subject to capitalization against the public."
Had the "easements " been called franchises it is probable that no value would have been ascribed to them for
rate-making purposes. For the Maryland public utilities
law, in common with the statutes of many States,7 forbids
the capitalization of franchises. But calling these privileges " easements" does not differentiate them for rate
purposes from ordinary corporate franchises, when applying the Federal Constitution. In none of the cases excluding franchises from plant value was any distinction
made, in this respect, between ordinary corporate fran-

chises and franchises to use the public streets, although
many of the cases involved privileges of the latter type.

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

The Court .of -Appeals and the Commission were in*fluenced by the fact that the so-called " easements" were
taxed. This fact does not justify including them in the
rate base. Corporate franchises are frequently taxed; 8
and although taxed, are not valued for rate purposes.
Compare Georgia Railway & P. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 278 Fed. 242, 244-5. The "easements" differ from
ordinary franchises only in the technicality that, under
the law of Maryland, the right to use the streets is, for
taxation purposes, real property, whereas ordinary franchises are personal property.
Second. The amount which the Commission fixed, in
its original report, as the appropriate depreciation charge
was $883,544. That sum is 5 per cent. of the estimated
gross revenues. Referring to the method of arriving at
the amount of the charge the Commission there said:
"The Commission believes that it might be more logical
to base the annual allowance for depreciation upon the
cost of depreciable property, rather than upon gross revenues. The relation between gross revenues and depreciation is remote and indirect while there is a direct relation
between the cost of a piece of property and the amount
that ought to be set aside for its consumption by use.
However, -the allowance which this Commission has made
for depreciation, 5 per cent. of the gross revenues, has
provided fairly well for current depreciation and retirements . . . Moreover, there is a broad twilight zone
between depreciation and maintenance, and it may well
be (and without any impropriety) that the maintenance
account has been used to a certain extent to provide for
depreciation. . . Any increase in the gross revenues
resulting from an increase in fares would increase the
amounts that would be set aside for depreciation and

maintenance." 9 Without deciding that this allowance
was inadequate, the Court of Appeals held that, as a
matter of law, the depreciation charge should be based
upon the then value of the depreciable property as distinguished from its cost; and directed the Commission to
revise its estimates accordingly. Pursuant to that direction, the Commission added, in its supplemental report,
$755,116 to the depreciation charge. The addition was,
I think, ordered by the Court of Appeals under a misapprehension of the nature and function of the depreciation
charge. And, in considering the adequacy of the return
under the Federal Constitution, the estimate of the net
earnings should accordingly be increased by $755,116,
which, on the rate base of $70,000,000, would ada' 1.08
per cent. to the estimated return.
That the Court of Appeals erred in its decision becomes
clear when the nature and purpose of the depreciation
charge are analyzed and the methods of determining its
proper amount are considered. 'The annual account of a
street railway, or other business, is designed to show the
profit or loss, and to acquaint those interested with the
condition of the business. To be true, the account must

not wear out within a single accounting period. They
have varying service lives, some remaining useful for many
years. Experience teaches that at the end of some period
of time most of these units, too, will wear out physically
or cease to be useful in the service. If the initial outlay
for such units is entirely disregarded, the annual account
will not reflect the true results of operation and the initial
investment may be lost. If, on the other hand, this
original expense is treated as part of the operating expenses of the year in which the plant unit was purchased,
or was retired or replaced, the account again will not reflect the true results of operation. For operations in one
year will then be burdened with an expense which isproperly chargeable against a much longer period of use.
Therefore, in ascertaining the profits of a year, it is generally deemed necessary to apportion to the operations of
that year a part of the total expense incident to the wearing out of plant. This apportionment is commonly made
by means of a depreciation charge. 1
It is urged by the Railways that if the base used in determining what is a fair return on the use of its property
is the present value, then logically the base to be used in
determining the depreciation charge-a charge for the
consumption of plant in service-must also be the pres-The depreciation charge or allowance is the annual or monthly
amount thus apportioned as the year's equitable share of the expense
of ultimate retirement of plant. The yearly charge is by many concerns allocated in monthly instalments. A depreciation reserve is a
bookkeeping classification to which the depreciation charges are periodically credited. A depreciation fund is a fund separately maintained
in which amounts charged for depreciation are periodically deposited.

Serv. Comm., 262 U. S. 276, 289 and St. Louis & O'Fallon
R. Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 461, 488 applies to the
depreciation charge. But acceptance of the doctrine of
Smyth v. Ames does not requiro that the depreciation
charge be based on present value of plant. For, an annual depreciation charge is not a measure of the actual
consumption of plant during the year. No such measure
has yet been invented. There is no regularity in the development of depreciation. It does not proceed in accordance with any mathematical law. There is nothing
in business experience, or in the training of experts, which
enables man to say to what extent service life will be impaired by the Operations of a single year, or of a series of
years less than the service life."

If the depreciation charge measured the actual consumption of

plant, the logic of this conclusion might seem forceful. It should be
pointed out, therefore, that, apart from the fact developed in the text,
that the charge does not measure the actual consumption of plant, the
contention is specious. A business man investing in a long-lived plant
does not expect to have its value returned to him in instalments corresponding to the loss of service life. The most that a continuing
business like a street railway may expect is that, at the end of the
service life, it shall be reimbursed with the then value of the original
investment, or with funds sufficient to replace the plant. As will be
shown presently, there is no basis for assuming that either the value
of the original investment or the replacement cost will, at the end of
the service life, equal or approximate the present value. See note 49,
infra.

it is retired, some theory of depreciation progress must be assumed

Where a plant intended, like a street railway, for continuing operation is maintained at a constant level of efficiency, it is rarely possible to determine definitely whether
or not its service life has in fact lessened within a particular year. The life expectancy of a plant, like that of an
individual, may be in fact greater, because of unusual repairs or other causes, at the end of a particular year than
it was at the beginning.1 4 And even where it is known
that there has been some lessening of. service life within
the year, it is never possible to determine with accuracy
what percentage of the unit's service life has, in fact, been
so consumed. Nor is it essential to the aim of the charge
that this fact should be known. The main purpose of
the charge is that irrespective of the rate of depreciation
there shall be produced, through annual contributions, by
the end of the service life of the depreciable plant, an
amount equal to the total net expense of its retirement. 5
on which such allowances may be based." 81 Am. Soc. of Civil Eng.
Transactions (1917), 1311, 1462-3. Compare E. A. Saliers, op. cit.,

consistently taken the position that no depreciation exists in a railroad
property which is maintained in 100 per cent efficiency." Proposed

15 Some contend "that where accruing depreciation is dependent,
not upon lapse of time, but upon amount and extent of use, it is
unscientific to provide for depreciation charges in equal annual installments, and that these charges should be made to correspond with
units of use rather than of time. By relating the charges to units of
use, they contend that the burden of the charges will be spread more
equitably, to the financial advantage of the carrier, over alternating
periods of light and heavy traffic." Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, note 14, supra, p. 15. The practices
of street railways differ in respect to the manner of laying the year's
contribution to the depreciation reserve. Some lay a fixed percentage
upon the gross revenues; some a number of cents per car mile; some
a fixed percentage on the cost of the depreciable plant. Though ex-

To that end it is necessary only that some reasonable plan
of distribution be adopted. Since it is impossible to ascertain what percentage of the service life is consumed in
any year,1 it is either assumed that depreciation proceeds
at some average rate (thus accepting the approximation
to fact customarily obtained through the process of averaging) or the annual charge is fixed without any regard
to the rate of depreciation."
The depreciation charge is an allowance made pursuant
to a plan of distribution of the total net expense of plant
retirement. It is a bookkeeping device introduced in the
exercise of practical judgment to serve three purposes.
It preserves the integrity of the investment. Compare
Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 13-14.

It

serves to distribute equitably throughout the several
years of service life the only expense of plant retirement
which is capable of reasonable ascertainment-the known
cost less the estimated salvage value. And it enables
those interested, through applying that plan of distribution, to ascertain, as nearly as is possible, the actual financial results of the year's operation. Many methods of
calculating the amount of the allowance are used.' The
charges to operating expenses in the several years and in
the aggregate vary according to the method adopted. 8
But under none of these methods of fixing the depreciation charge is an attempt made to determine the percentage of actual consumption of plant falling within a parpressed in different terms, the
may in fact be based on cost.

Third. The business device ,known as the depreciation
charge appears not to have been widely adopted in
America until after the beginning of this century." Its
use is still stoutly resisted by many concerns. 2' Wherever
adopted, the depreciation charge is based on the original
cost of the plant to the owner. When the great changes
in price levels incident to the World War led some to
1eSee E. A. Saliers, op. cit., note 11, supra, at p. 132: "This
method (reducing balance), . . . does not take into account
either 'the actual rapidity with which depreciation occurs, or the
various modifying factors which may show their influence at any
time. Since this objection is common to all methods, other considerations will probably lead to a choice."
20 The first case in which this Court expressly recognized a depreciation allowance as a part of operating expenses is Knoxville v.
Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 13, decided in 1909. In earlier
cases cognizance was not taken of it. Compare Union Pacific R. Co.
v. United States, 99 U. S. 402, 420; United States v. Kansas Pacfic
R. Co., 99 U. S. 455, 459; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper,
189 U. S. 439, 446. See also Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, 223 U. S.
349, 363. Among street railways, the Milwaukee Electric Railway
& Light Co. became the pioneer by adopting it in 1897. Others
followed in 1905. 31 Street Ry. Journal 169-70; 687-8. In England,
the adoption of the depreciaton charge had been hastened by a
provision in the income tax law. Customs and Inland Revenue Act
1878, 41 Vict. c. 15, § 12. Massachusetts Acts 1849, c. 191, provided
that the annual report required of railroads should give full information on "Estimated depreciation beyond the renewals, viz: road and
bridges, buildings, engines and cars." See also Act 1846, c. 251. But
in Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the United States, depreciation
charges have not been customary among railroads, except in respect
to equipment, pursuant to the rule prescribed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission in 1907.

question the wisdom of the practice of basing the charge
on original cost, the Chamber of Commerce of the United
States warned business men against the fallacy of departing from the accepted basis." And that warning has been
recently repeated: "When the cost of an asset, less any
salvage value, has been recovered, the process of depreciation stops,-the consumer has paid for that particular
item of service. There are those who maintain that the
obligation of the consumer is one rather of replacement,building for building, machine for machine. According
to this view depreciation should be based on replacement
cost rather than actual cost. The replacement theory substitutes for something certain and definite, the actual cost,
a cost of reproduction which is highly speculative and
conjectural and requiring frequent revision. It, moreover,
seeks to establish for one expense a basis of computation
fundamentally different from that used for the other
expenses of doing business. Insurane is charged on a
basis of actual premiums paid, not on the basis of probable premiums three years hence; rent on the amount
actually paid, not on the problematical rate of the next
lease, salaries, light, heat, power, supplies are all charged
at actual, not upon a future contingent cost. As one
writer has expressed it, 'The fact that the plant cannot
be replaced at the same cost, but only at much more, has
nothing to do with the cost of its product, but only with
the cost of futtire product turned out by the subsequent
plant.' As the product goes through your factory it
should be burdened with expired, not anticipated, costs.
Charge depreciationupon actual cost less any salvage." 28

those accustomed to read the language of accounting a
depreciation charge is understood as meaning the appropriate contribution for that year to the amount required
to make good the cost of the plant which ultimately must
be retired. On that basis, public accountants certify to
investors and bankers the results of operation, -whether of
public utilities, or of manufacturing or mercantile concerns. Corporate securities are issued, bought and sold,
and vast loans are made daily, in reliance upon statements
so prepared. The compelling logic of facts which led business men to introduce a depreciation charge has led them
to continue to base it on the original cost of the plant
despite the great changes in the price level incident to the
World War. Basing the depreciation charge on cost is a
rule, prescribed or recommended by those associations of
business men who have had occasion since the World
War to consider the subject.25

theory is impractical because it would require a constant revaluation
of assets. It is, furthermore, unlikely that any manufacturer would

loss of a business transaction is commonly ascertained by
deducting from the gross receipts the expenditures incurred in producing them. Business men realized fully
that the requirements for replacement might be more or
less-than the original cost. But they realized also that
to attempt to make the depreciation account reflect economic conditions and changes 'would enta'.l entry upon
new fields of conjecture and prophecy which would defeat
its purposes. For there is no basis in experience which
can justify predicting whether a replacement, renewal or
substitution falling in some future year will cost more or
less than it would at present, or more or less than the
unit cost when it was acquired.
The business men's practice of using a depreciation
charge based on the original cost of, the plant in determining the profits, or losses of a particular year has abundant official sanction and encouragement. The practice
was prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission
in 1907,2" when, in cooperation with the Association of
American Railway Accounting Officers, it drafted the rule,
which is still in force,2 ' requiring steam railroads to make
rebuild the same plant ten years after its construction. 3. The
depreciation charge absorbed in the cost of the product represents
a charge for the use of present manufacturing facilities and cannot
have any connection with assets to be acquired in the future. The
depreciation charge on new and more efficient equipment to be
acquired in the future may be higher and, perhaps, offset by a
general reduction in manufacturing cost per unit. It is not logical
to base all other cost elements on present expenses and make the
one exception in the case of depreciation." (P. 45.)

Fourth. In 1927 the business men's practice of basing
the depreciation charge on cost was applied by this Court
in United States v. Ludey, 274 U. S. 295, 300-301, a federal income tax case, saying: "The amount of the allowance for depreciation is the sum which should be set aside
for the taxable year, in order that, at the end of the useSouth Carolina-ReRock Hill Tel Co., P. U; R. 1928E, 221, 230, "We
are of opinion that the cost of the property is the only possible reasonable authority upon which depreciation can be calculated. Depreciation is a reserve to equalize retirements and not a reserve to
equalize replacements. A rate of depreciation based upon original cost,
even, is little more than an intelligent guess; but based upon reproduction costs is the blindest kind of speculation. With the known original
cost of a unit and an engineer's estimate of its service life and salvage
value, .

its service life and salvage value is bad enough but who would venture

decision, as before, the Bell Telephone companies have
persisted in basing their depreciation charges upon the
original cost of the depreciable property, Board of Public

And they have insisted that the order of the Interstate
Commerce Commission requiring a depreciation charge,
118 I. C. C. 295, should be so framed as to permit the continuance of that accounting practice.4" The protest of
the railroads, in that proceeding, against basing the charge
on cost was made for the first time in 1927, in their petitions for a rehearing. And this protest came only from
those who insist that no depreciation charge whatsoever
shall be made.4"
To use a depreciation charge as the measure of the
year's consumption of plant, and at the same time reject
original cost as the basis of the charge, is inadmissible.

It is a perversion of this business device. No method for
the ascertainment of the amount of the charge yet invented is workable if fluctuating present values be taken
as the basis. Every known method contemplates, and
is dependent upon, the accumulation or credit of a fixed
amount in a given number of years. The distribution of
plant expense expressed in the depreciation charge is justified by the approximation to the fact as to the year's
plant consumption which is obtained by applying the doctrine of averages. But if fluctuating present values are
substituted for original cost there is no stable base to which
the process of averaging can be applied. For thereby the
only stable factor involved in fixing a depreciation charge
would be eliminated. Each year the present value may
be different. The cost of replacement at the termination
of the service life of the several units or of the composite
life cannot be foretold.49 To use as a measure of the
year's consumption of plant a depreciation charge based
on fluctuating present values substitutes conjecture for
experience. Such a system would require the consumer
of today to pay for an assumed operating expense which
has never been incurred and which may never arise.
The depreciation charge is frequently likened to the
annual premium in legal reserve life insurance. The life
49 In part, costs and values in the several future years will depend
upon the general price level. As to this, even the economist can know
nothing, save how the general price level has heretofore fluctuated
from year to year; and that periods of rising prices have ever been
followed by periods of falling prices. But cost and value in the several future years will depend in part upon factors other than the general price level. Even if the general price level for every future year
were known, it would still be impossible to predict with reasonable
accuracy the then cost or value of a unit then to be replaced,,re-'
newed or retired. For despite a higher general price level, the part
might be procurable at smaller costs, by reason of economies intro-

duced in its manufacture and changes in the methods and means of
performing the work. See Excess Income of St. Louis & O'Fallon

insurance premium is calculated on an agreed value of the
human life-comparable to the known cost of plant-not
on a fluctuating value, unknown and unknowable. The
field of life insurance presented a problem comparable to
that here involved. Despite the large experience embodied in the standard mortality tables and the relative
simplicity of the problem there presented, the actual mortality was found to vary so widely from that for which
the premiums had provided, that their rate was found to
work serious injustice either to the insurer or to the insured. The transaction resulted sometimes in bankruptcy
of the insurer; sometimes in his securing profits which
were extortionate; and rarely, in his receiving only the
intended fair compensation for the service rendered' Because every attempt to approximate more nearly the
amount of premium required proved futile, justice was
sought and found in the system of strictly mutual insurance. Under that system the premium charged is made
clearly ample; and the part which proves not to have been
needed enures insome form of benefit to him who paid it.
. Similarly, if, instead of applying the rule -of Smyth v.
Ames, the 'rate base of a utility were fixed at the amount
prudently*invested, the' inevitable errors incident to estimating service life and, net expense in plant consumption
could never result in injustice either to the utility or to
the community. For, if the amount set aside for depreciation proved inadequate and investment of new capital
became necessary, the utility would be permitted to earn
a return on the new capital. And if -the amount set aside
for depreciation proved to be excessive, the income from
the surplus reserve would operate as a credit to reduce
the capital charge which the rates must earn. If the
Railways should ever suffer injustice from adopting cost
of plant as the basis for calculating the depreciation
charge, it will be an unavoidable incident of applying in
valuation the rule of Smyth v. Ames. This risk, if it

exists, cannot be escaped by basing the charge on present
value. For this suggested escape, besides being entirely
conjectural, is instinct with certainty of injustice either
to the community or the Railways. The possibility of
such injustice admonishes us, as it did in deciding the
constitutional questions concerning interstate commerce,

companies and some other concerns, deny the propriety
of making any annual depreciation charge. 1 They insist that the making of such a charge will serve rather
to mislead than to aid in determining the financial result
of the year's operations. -They urge that the current
cost of maintaining the plant, whether by repair, renewals
or replacements, should be treated as a part of the maintenance account, at least in systems consisting of large
and diversified properties intended for continuous operation and requiring a constant level of efficiency. They
insist that, in such systems, retirements, replacements
and renewals attain a uniform rate and tend to be equal
each year; that, therefore, no great disproportion in
revenues and operating expenses in the various years
results if the whole expenditure made for renewals or
replacements in any year is treated as an expense of operation of that year and the retirements of property are
not otherwise reflected in any specific charge. They
admit that it may be desirable to create a special reserve, to enable the company to spread the cost of retiring certain large units of property over a series of years,
thus preventing a disproportionate burden upon the operations of a single year. But they say that such a reserve is not properly called a depreciation reserve.
Moreover they contend that whena large unit.is retired,
not because it has been worn out but because some more
efficient substitute has been found, the cost of retirerequire only a reserve. In Maryland, the Commission's power over
accounting methods is held to include the power to require deprecia.tion accounting, but not the maintaining of a separate fund. See

ment should be spread over the future, so that it may fall
upon those who will gain the benefit of the enhanced
efficiency. Compare Kansas City Southern R. Co. v.
United States, 231 U. S. 423, 440-441. Under the replacement method of accounting advocated by the railroads and others there is no depreciation charge and no
depreciation reserve. Operating expenses are charged
directly with replacements at their cost. This method
does not concern itself with all retirements, but only with
retirements which are replaced."2
Despite the seemingly unanswerable logic of a depreciation charge, they oppose its adoption, urging the uncertainties inherent in the predetermination of service
life and of salvage value, and the disagreement among
experts as to the most equitable plan of distributing the
total net plant expense among the several years of
service. They point out that each step in the process of
fixing a depreciation charge is beset with difficulties, because of the variables which attend every determination involved. The first step is to estimate how long
the depreciable plant will remain in service. Engineers
calculate with certitude its composite service life by ap52

A modification of the depreciation reserve method is the "retirement reserve" recommended by the National Association of Railroad
and Utilities Commissioners. This reserve does not involve necessary

reserve are credited "such amounts as are charged to the operating

plying weighted averages to the data concerning the
several property units. But their exactitude is delusive.
Each unit has its individual life dependent upon the
effect of physical exhaustion, obsolescence, inadequacy
and public requirement."
The physical duration of the
life depends largely upon the conditions of the use; and
these cannot be foretold. The process of obsolescence
is even less predictable. Advances in the arts are cnstantly being made which would require retirement at
some time, even if the unit were endowed with perpetual
physical life. But these advances do not proceed at, a
uniform pace. The normal progress of invention is
stimulated or retarded by the ever changing conditions
53 The adequacy of a depreciation charge depends, among other
things, upon the liberality of the particular concern's practice in
respect to maintenance, 81 Amer. Soc. Civil Eng. Transactions (1917),
1490; R. H. Montgomery, Auditing Theory And Practice (1921) Vol.
1, p. 625. It depends in part upon the scope of the causes of retirement to be covered by it. As to what is the proper scope, opinion
differs widely. The telephone companies (Bell System) contend that
the charge should cover all causes- of retirement not provided for
by ordinary maintenance charges, including extraordinary casualties
like storm and fire. 118 I. C. C. 340. Others insist that the charge
should not include any allowance for contingent or presently unascertainable obsolescence, inadequacy, changes in the art, public requirements, storm casualties, or extraordinary repairs or expense of similar
character. 118 I. C. C. 341. Still others insist that the charge
should cover only exhaustion due to wear and tear and lapse of
time, collectively called superannuation, but not obsolescence, inadequacy and the like, which are said to be precipitate in their operation. The Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission on Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, Docket Nos.
14700 and 15100, August 15, 1929, pp. 27-28, defines depreciation
as "the loss in service value not restored by current maintenance
and incurred in connection with the cofisumption or prospective
retirement of property in the course of service from causes against
which the carrier is not protected by insurance, which are known to
be in current operation, and whose effect can be forecast with a
reasonable approach to accuracy."

of business. Moreover, it is the practical embodiment of
inventions which produces obsolescence; and business
conditions determine even more largely the time and the
extent to which new inventions are embodied in improved machines. The march toward inadequacy, as distinguished from obsolescence, is likewise erratic.
The protestants point out that uncertainty is incident
also to the second step in the process of fixing the appropriate depreciation charge. A plant unit rarely remains in service until consumed physically. Scrap remains; and this must be accounted for, since it is the
net expense of the exhaustion of plant which the depreciation charge is to cover. Such scrap value is often a
very large factor in the calculation of plant expense."'
The probable salvage on the unit when retired at the
end of its service life must, therefore, be estimated. But
its future value is never knowable.
And, finally, the protestants show that after the net
expense in plant consumption is thus estimated, there
remains the task of distributing it equitably over the
assumed service life-the allocation of the amount as
charges of the several years. There are many recognized
methods for calculating these amounts, each method having strenuous advocates; and the amounts thus to be
charged, in the aggregate as well as in the successive
years, differ widely according to the method adopted. 5
Under the straight line method, the aggregate of the
charges of the several years equals the net plant expense
for the whole period of service life; and the charge is the

same for all the years. Under the sinking fund method,
the aggregate of the charges of the several years is less
than the net plant expense for the whole period; because
the proceeds of each year's charge are deemed to have
been continuously invested at compound interest and the
balance is assumed to be obtained from interest accumulations. Other methods of distributing the total charge
produce still other results in the amount of the charges
laid upon the operating expense of the several years of
service."

panics should prevail."7 For in neither event was the
Court of Appeals justified in directing an, increase in
the allowance. The adequacy of a depreciation charge is
dependent in large measure upon the practice of the individual concern with respect to its maintenance account.
The Commission found that the Railways' property was
well maintained and that the allowance of $883,544, together with the usual maintenance charges, would be
adequate to keep the property at a constant level of efficiency. It found further, on the basis of the Company's
experience, that the charges previously allowed had
served " fairly. well " to take care of current, depreciation
and retirements. The depreciation charge was established by the Railways in 1912 and was fixed by it, of
its own motion, at 5 per cent. of the gross revenues. The
charge at that rate had been cdntinued ever since and had
yielded each year an increasing sum. For the gross revenues had grown steadily. In the early years, they grew
through increase of the number of passengers carried;
since 1919, through the repeated increases in the rate of
fare. In nearly every year, the allowance had exceeded
the charges for retirements. After charging retirements,
5 Nor need we express an opinion on the relation between a utility's depreciation reserve and the valuation of the accrued deprecihtion of its property. See Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, note 14, supra, at pp. 20-24. While it is true that
the annual depreciation charge does not purport to measure the current actual consumption of plant, it may be that the credit balance

in the depreciation reserve is good evidence of the amount of accrued
depreciation. See New York Telephone Co. v. Prendergast, 36 F.
(2d) 54. It may also be that so much of the depreciation reserve
as has not been used for retirements or replacements should be
subtracted from the present value of the utility's property in determining the rate base, on the theory thit the amounts thus contributed
by the public represent a p'art payment for the property consumed
or to be consumed in service. Compare Burns' Ann. Ind. Stat.
(1926), Vol. 3, §§ 12693-12696, p. 1245. These matters are not
involved in the case at bar and as to them no opinion is expressed.

whether replaced or not., to the reserve, there remained
a credit, on August 31, 1927, of $1,413,793. The allowance of $883,544 is equal to 5 per cent. of the estimated
gross.revenues for 1928. The increase of this allowance
for 1928 over that for 1914 was greater proportionately
than the increase of the 1928 value of the Railways'
property over its 1914 value."
The estimated charge of $883,544 was thus clearly ample as the year's share of the expense of plant retirement
based on cost. But even if the annual depreciation allowance could be made to correspond with the actual
consumption of plant, there was nothing in the record to
show that the value of the part of plant to be consumed
in 1928 would exceed that amount. Nor is there anything in the record or in the findings to show that $883,544. together with the usual maintenance charges and
under the improved methods of construction, would be
inadequate to provide, at the prices then prevailing, for
the replacements required in that year, and also for the
year's contribution to a special reserve under the plan
advocated by the railroads before the Interstate Commerce .Commission. On the contrary, the Company's
history " and the present advances in the street railway
industry strongly indicate that, by employing new equipment of lesser value,"° the Railways could render more
efficient service at,,smaller operating costs. Neither the
trial court nor thl 'Court of Appeals made any finding
on these matters. The Commission's finding that

for 1914, $469,395, is multiplied by the 'same index figure, the product
is $160,676 less than the allowance originally made for 1928. The
additions to plant since 1914, $7,500,000, required a proportional increase in the depreciation charge of only $145,500.

$883,544 was an adequate depreciation charge should,
therefore, have been accepted by the Court of Appeals,
whether the sum allowed be deemed a depreciation charge
properly so called, or be treated as the year's contribution
to a special reserve to supplement the usual maintenance
charges.
It is clear that the management of the Railways
deemed the charge of 5 per cent. of gross revenues adequate. On that assumption it paid dividends on the
common stock in each year from 1923 through 1927.1
If the addition to the depreciation charge ordered by the
Court of Appeals was proper for the year 1928, it should
have also been made in the preceding five years.2

such a re'casting of the accounts, no profits were earned
after 1924; and there was no surplus fund from which
dividends could have been paid legally. If the contention now urged by the Railways is sound, the management misrepresented by its published accounts its financial condition and the results of operation of the several
years; and it paid dividends in violation of law. 3
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES joins in this opinion.
61 The Company was not, of course, restricted to a depreciation
charge of 5 per cent. of gross' revenues. That was only the amount
which the Commission deemed adequate. But the Company was
free to reserve'a greater amount, without paying dividends, if it believed a greater amount was necessary. Cf. Havre de Grace Bridge
Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 132 Md. 16.
62 The value of the depreciable property in each of the five years
preceding 1928 was almost constant and at least equal to that in 1928,

were paid. The recorded surplus at the beginning of 1923 was
$1,553,097.83. If the depreciation allowance contended for had been
made in each of those years, this surplus would have been wiped out
in 1925 and there would have remained a deficit, after payment of
dividends of $416,568 in 1925, $1,027,837 in 1926, and $2,140,146 in
1927. Instead, the Railways reported a surplus of $2,005,473 at the

I agree with what Mr. Justice Brandeis has said, both
as to the propriety of excluding from the rate base the
value of the franchise or easement donated to the Railway Company and with respect to the method of ascertaining depreciation. But of this I would say a further
word.
I will assume, for present purposes, that as a result of
Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.466, the function of a depreciation account for rate making purposes must be taken to
be the establishment of a fund for the replacement of
plant rather than the restoration of cost or value of the
original plant investment. But -what amount annually
carried to reserve will be sufficient to replace all the elements of a composite property purchased at various
times, at varying price levels, as they wear out or become
obsolete, is a question, not of law but of fact. It is a
question which must be answered on the basis of a prediction of the salvage value of the obsolete elements, the
character of the articles which will be selected to replace
them when replacement is necessary, and their cost at
the time of replacement.
Obviously, that question cannot be answered by a priori
reasoning. Experience is our only guide, tempered by
the consideration of such special or unusual facts and
circumstances as would tend to modify the results of experience. Experience, which embraces the past fifteen
years of high price levels, and the studies of experts, resulting in the universally accepted practice of accountend of 1925, $2,020,863 at the end of 1926 and $1,588,823 at the end
of 1927. See Moody's Manual of Investments (Public Utilities) 1929,
pp. 375-6; Poor's Public Utility Section 1929, p. 968. In declaring
these dividends, the management did not overlook the necessity of
adequate provision for depreciation. Fcw, in the several rate cases
before the Commission it had insisted that the depreciation allowances were inadequate.

ants and business economists, as recounted in detail by
Mr. Justice Brandeis, have demonstrated that depreciation reserve, calculated on the basis of cost, has proven
to be the most trustworthy guide in determining the
amount required to replace, at the end of their useful
life, the constantly shifting elements of a property such
as the present. Costs of renewals made during the
present prolonged period of high prices and diminishing
replacement costs tend to offset the higher cost of replacing articles purchased in periods of lower prices. I think
that we should be guided by that experience and practice
in the absence of proof of any special circumstances showing that they are inapplicable to the particular situation
with which we are now concerned.
Such proof, in the present case' is wanting. The only
circumstance relied on for a different basis of depreciation, and one which is embraced in that experience, is
the current high price level, which has raised the present
reproduction value of the carrier's property, as a whole,
above its cost. That, of course, might be a controlling
consideration if we were dealing with present replacements or their present cost, instead of'replacements to be
made at various uncertain dates in 'hlie future, of articles
purchased at different times in the past, at varying price
levels. But I cannot say that since prices at the present
moment are high, as a result of post-war inflation, a rate
of return which is sufficient :to yield 7.78 per cent. on
present reproduction value, after adequate depreciation
based on cost of the carrier's property, is confiscatory
because logic requires the prediction that the elements of
petitioner's property cannot, in.years to come, be renewed
or replaced with. adequate substitutes, at less than the
present average reproduction cost of the entire property-and this in the face of the facts that the cost of
replacements in the past fifteen years has been for the
most part at higher price levels than at present, that

Syllabus.

the amount allowed by the Commission for depreciation
has been in practice more than sufficient for all replacement requirements throughout the period of higher price
levels, and that the Company has declared and paid
dividends which were earned only if this depreciation
reserve was adequate.
To say that the- present price level is necessarily the
true measure of future replacement cost is to substitute
for a relevant fact which I should have thought ought
to be established as are other facts, a rule of law which
seems not to follow from Smyth v. Ames, and to be
founded neither upon experience nor expert opinion and
to be unworkable in practice. In the present case it can be
applied only by disregarding evidence which would seem
persuasively to establish the very fact to be ascertained.
