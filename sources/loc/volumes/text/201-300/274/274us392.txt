in location, use and physical character of the streets, the
extent to which paving has been completed and local
methods of assessing benefits for street paving, are some
of the considerations which might reasonably move the
legislature to require street paving of one road or several
and not of others. Cf. Metropolitan Street Ry. v. New
York, 199 U. S. 1, 46, 47; N. Y., N. H. & H. R. R. v. New
York, 165 U. S. 628; Erb v. Morasch, 177 U. S. 584, 586;
Savannah, Thunderbolt Ry. v. Savannah, 198 U. S. 392.
We may not assume in the absence of proof that such
differences do not exist. Erb v. Morasch, supra; Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co., 249 U. S. 152, 158;
Swiss Oil Corp. v. Shanks, 273 U. S. 407.
There are no facts disclosed by the record which would
enable us to say that the legislative action with which
we are here concerned was necessarily arbitrary or unreasonable or justify us in overruling the judgment of
the state court that it was reasonable. Public Service Co.
v. Durham, supra, 154.
Judgment affirmed.

OHIO EX REL. CLARKE v. DECKEBACH, AUDITOR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.

No. 272. Argued April 18, "19, 1927.-Decided May 16, 1927.
1. Construction of the pleadings by the state supreme court as sufficiently drawing in question the validity of an ordinance under a
treaty will be followed by this Court on review of the judgment
upholding the ordinance. P. 394.
2. The provision of the Treaty with Great Britain (July 3, 1815,
August 6, 1827) that "the merchants and traders of each nation
โข. shall enjoy the most complete protection and security for
their commerce," does not apply to proprietors of places of amusement, like a billiard hall. P. 395.

392

Opinion of the Court.

3. A city ordinance prohibiting the issuance to aliens of licenses to
conduct pool and billiard rooms, does not violate the rights of aliens
under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
So held in view of the character of the business, and the absence
of ground for concluding that the legislative council acted without
a rational basis in determining that aliens as a class were disqualified by their associations, experiences and interests, from conducting
the business, and in excluding the entire class rather than its objectionable members selected by more empirical methods. P. 396.

ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio
dismissing a petition for a writ of mandamus to require
the Auditor of Cincinnati to issue a license to Clarke, the
petitioner.
Mr. George S. Hawke for plaintiff in error.
Mr. John D. Ellis, City Solicitor of Cincinnati, for
defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE STONE. delivered the opinion of the Court.

An ordinance, No. 76-1918, of the City of Cincinnati,
requires the licensing of pool and billiard rooms, and prohibits the issue of licenses to aliens. Plaintiff in error
petitioned the Supreme Court of Ohio for a writ of mandamus commanding defendant in error, the auditor of
Cincinnati, to grant him a license to conduct a billiard
and pool room in that city. The petition alleged that
plaintiff was a subject of the King of England and that
he had been, refused a license solely because he was not
a citizen. It drew in question the validity of the ordinance as violating Art. I of the treaty between Great
Britain and the United States of July 3, 1815, 8 Stat.
228; August 6, 1827, 8 Stat. 361; 1 Malloy, Treaties, 624,
645, and as denying the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Opinion of the Court.

274 U. S.

Defendant answered, traversing the allegation of citizenship, and asserting that billiard and pool rooms in the
City of Cincinnati are meeting places of idle and vicious
persons; that they are frequented by lawbreakers and
other undesirable persons, and contribute to juvenile delinquency; that numerous crimes and offenses have been
committed in them and consequently they require strict
police surveillance; that non-citizens as a class are less
familiar with the laws and customs of this country than
native born and naturalized citizens; that the maintenance of billiard and pool rooms by them is a menace to
society and to the public welfare, and that the ordinance
is a reasonable police regulation passed in the interest of
and for the benefit of the public.
On plaintiff's motion, the Supreme Court of Ohio gave
judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the petition. 113
Oh. St. 347. In an earlier case, State ex rel Balli v. Carrel, 99 Oh. St. 285, it had held that the ordinance in question did not deny any rights guaranteed by the Federal
Constitution. The case comes here on writ of error, Jud.
Code, ยง 237 as amended, the plaintiff renewing here the
contentions made below.
At the outset defendant insists that plaintiff has not
established that he is entitled to the benefit of the treaty
since his allegation of citizenship is not admitted on the
face of the pleadings. But the Supreme Court of Ohio
has construed the pleadings as sufficient to draw in question the validity of the ordinance under the treaty.
Hence we need not concern ourselves with those refinements of the local law of pleading which, it is said, enable
defendant to justify his refusal to issue a license because
of plaintiff's assertion of British citizenship, and at the
same time deny that plaintiff has established citizenship
entitling him to the protection of the treaty. See Forsyth v. Vehmeyer, 177 U. S. 177, 180; Allen v. Alleghany
Co., 196 U. S. 458, 465, 466; Atlantic Coast Line R. R.

v. Mims, 242 U. S. 532, 535; Nevada-California-Oregon
Ry. v. Burrus, 244 U. S. 103; Lee v. Central of Georgia
Ry., 252 U. S. 109.
The application of the treaty to the present case requires but brief consideration. As stated in the title its
purpose is "to regulate the commerce" between the
two countries. Article I, which it is said affords the protection against the present discrimination, is printed
in the margin.' It guarantees "reciprocal liberty of commerce" between the territories of the signatories. The
privileges secured by it to the inhabitants of the two
countries, so far as relevant to the present controversy,
pertain to and are intended to facilitate commerce. The
clause suggested as pertinent reads: "and, generally,
the merchants and traders of each nation, respectively,
shall enjoy the most complete protection and security
for their commerce." Even if assumed, as argued, that
the proprietor of a pool room may for some purposes be
regarded as engaged in a trade, the word being used as
synonymous with occupation or employment, he does not
engage in commerce within the meaning of a treaty which
merely extends to "merchants and traders" "protection
and security for their commerce." See Bobe v. Lloyds, 10
Fed. (2d) 730, 734. It would be an extravagant applica,
1"Art. I. There shall be between the territories of the United
States of America, and all the territories of his Britannick majesty
in Europe, a reciprocal liberty of commerce. The inhabitants of the
two countries, respectively, shall have liberty freely and securely to
come with their ships and cargoes to all such places, ports, and rivers,
in the territories aforesaid, to which other foreigners are permitted
to come, to enter into the same, and to remain and reside in any
parts of the said territories, respectively; also to hire and occupy
houses and warehouses for the purposes of their commerce; and, generally, the merchants and traders of each nation, respectively, shall
enjoy the most complete protection and security for their commerce,
but subject always to the laws and statutes of the two countries,
respectively."

tion of the language quoted to say that it could be extended to include the owner of a place of amusement who
does not necessarily buy, sell or exchange merchandise or
otherwise participate in commerce.
Asakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, relied on by plaintiff,
does not support his contention. It was there held that
the treaty with Japan of February 21, 1911, 37 Stat.
1504, was violated by a municipal ordinance prohibiting
the granting of pawnbrokers' licenses to non-citizens.
That treaty secured to the citizens of Japan the right to
"enter, travel and reside" in the United States and "to
carry on trade, wholesale and retail . . . and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade."
This language, which is plainly broader in some respects
than that of the British treaty, was held to embrace within its protection a Japanese pawnbroker whose business,
in contrast to that of plaintiff, necessarily involved the
lending of money on the security of merchandise and the
sale of merchandise when necessary to realize on the
security.
The objections to the constitutionality of the ordinance
are not persuasive. Although the Fourteenth Amendment has been held to prohibit plainly irrational discrimination against aliens, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.
356; Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33; In re Tiburcio Parrott,
1 Fed. 481; In re Ah Chong, 2 Fed. 733; Ho Ah Kow v.
Nunan, 5 Sawy. 552, 12 Fed. Cases, #6546; Wong Wai
v. Williamson, 103 Fed. 1; Fraser v. McConway & Torley Co., 82 Fed. 257, it does not follow that alien race and
allegiance may not bear in some instances such a relation
to .a legitimate object of legislation as to be made the
basis of a permitted classification. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138; Crane v. New York, 239 U. S. 195,
198; Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197; Porterfield v.
Webb, 263 U. S. 225; Webb v. O'Brien, 263 U. S. 313;

Opinion of the Court.-

Frick v. Webb, 263 U. S. 326; Cockrill v. California,268
U. S. 258; cf. McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391.
The admitted allegations of the answer set up the
harmful and vicious tendencies of public billiard and pool
rooms, of which this Court took judicial ilotice in Murphy
v. California, 225 U. S. 623. The regulation or even
prohibition of the business is not forbidden. Murphy v.
California, supra. The present regulation presupposes
that aliens in Cincinnati are not as well qualified as citizens to engage in this business. It is not necessary that
we be satisfied that this premise is well founded in experience. We cannot say that the city council gave unreasonable weight to the view admitted by the pleadings
that the associations, experiences and interests of members of the class disqualified the class as a whole from
conducting a business of dangerous tendencies.
It is enough for present purposes that the ordinance,
in the light of facts admitted or generally assumed, does
not preclude the possibility of a rational basis for the
legislative judgment and that we have no such knowledge of local conditions as. would enable us to say that
it is clearly wrong. Fort Smith Light & Traction Co. v.
Board of Improvement, ante, p. 387.
Some latitude must be allowed for the legislative appraisement of local conditions, Patsone v. Pennsylvania,
supra, 144; Adams v. Milwaukee, 228 U. S. 572, 583, and
for the legislative choice of methods for controlling an
apprehended evil. It was competent for the city to make
such a choice, not shown to be irrational, by excluding
from the conduct of a dubious business an entire class
rather than its objectionable members selected by more
empirical methods. See Westfall v. United States, ante,
p. 256.
Judgment affirmed.
