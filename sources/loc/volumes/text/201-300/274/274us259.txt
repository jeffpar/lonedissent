Statement of the Case.

whether there is a loss to the Reserve Banks or not But
every fraud like the one before us weakens the member
bank and therefore weakens the System. Moreover,
when it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make
the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so. It may punish the forgery and
utterance of spurious interstate bills of lading in order
to protect the genuine commerce. United States v.
Ferger,250 U. S. 199. See further, Southern Ry. Co. v.
United States, 222 U. S. 20, 26. That principle is
settled. Finally, Congress may employ state corporations
with their consent as instrumentalities of the United
States, Clallam County v. United States, 263 U. S. 341,
and may make frauds that impair their efficiency crimes.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Argument for the United States.

274 U. S.

Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, with whom
Solicitor GeneralMitchell, and Messrs. A. W. Gregg, General Counsel, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Sewall Key,
Attorney in the Department of Justice, and Raymond L.
Joy, were on the brief, for the United States.
The gains and profits derived from illicit traffic in
liquor constitute income. It has been uniformly held by
the courts that such income was intended by Congress to
fall within the purview of the Income Tax Act of 1921.
This interpretation is shown by the all-inclusive language
used by Congress to define income and by the history of
the changes in income-tax legislation. The questions
asked in the required income tax return do not compel
the disclosure of any fact which tends to incriminate.
Only information of the most general character relating
to the nature of the taxpayer's business is demanded, none
of which in itself constitutes proof of unlawful dealings.
In determining the nice balance that exists between the
constitutional rights of the individual and the sovereign's
right to compel information necessary for governmental
purposes the courts will go as far "as may be consistent
with the liberty of the individual." This is illustrated in
Mason v. United States, 244 U. S. 362, and Ex parte
Irvine, 74 Fed. 954. The taxpayer will not be permitted
to set himself up as the judge of his rights under the Fifth
Amendment. He must comply with the Government's
demand on him for information at least to the point
where the information would tend to incriminate. Podolin v. Lesher Warner Dry Goods Co., 210 Fed. 97. In
this case respondent failed to raise any claim of immunity
he might have had under the Fifth Amendment in the
proper manner and form, and in the failure to do so his
privilege must be deemed to be waived. United States
ex rel. Vajtauer v. Comm'r of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103.
A tax return is the statement of account between the
taxpayer and his Government. It is impressed with a

public interest and constitutes a public document. The
cases of Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, and Wilson
v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, both recognize that records required by law to be kept constitute an exception
to the application of the Fifth Amendment. Numerous
State cases have recognized this principle. United States
v. Sischo, 262 U. S. 165, is authority for the Government's
contention herein, because the effect of the Fifth Amendment on the interpretation contended for by the Government, of the statute requiring manifests, underlay the
whole case. The effect of the interpretation of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Income Tax Act in this case
would be to favor the lawbreaker and excuse from the
operation of the Act any person who set up a claim that
his income had been derived from criminal operations.
Such interpretation is to be avoided because it is contrary
to the purposes of the Act and is not demanded by a
proper application of the Fifth Amendment.
Mr. Frederick W. Aley, with whom Mr. E. Willoughbg
Middleton was on the brief, for respondent.
Section 223 of the Revenue Act of 1921, in so far as it
requires an income tax return of one whose income is
derived from a violation of the criminal law, is in conflict
with .the Fifth Amendment. The obvious intent of the
Fifth Amendment is that no one shall be compelled to be
the means of exposing his own criminality. This privilege is for the protection of the innocent as well as the
guilty, and is intended to prevent for all time anything
in the nature of inquisitorial proceedings to compel confession of crime. Such protection is an essential part of
the liberties of a free people and should be jealously
guarded from encroachment by the legislative branch of
the government. United States v. Boyd, 116 U. S. 616;
Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547; Emory's Case,
107 Mass. 172; McKnight v. United States, 115 Fed. 972.

Opinion of the Court.

See Steinberg v. United States, 14 F. (2d) 564, and Peacock v. Pratt,121 Fed. 772.
The privilege is not limited to testimony, as ordinarily
understood, but extends to every means by which one
may be compelled to produce information which may incriminate. Boyd v. United States, supra; Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591. Distinguishing Hale v. Henkel,
201 U. S. 43; Wilson v. United States, 221 U. S. 361;
Baltimore etc. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 221 U. S.612; and 'UnitedStates. v. Sischo, 262 U. S.
165. See McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U. S. 34; United
States v. Lombardo, 228 Fed. 980; United States v. Dalton, 286 Fed. 756; United States v. Mulligan, 268 Fed.
893; United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S.81;
United States v. Sherry, 294 Fed. 684.
The Income Tax Law does not grant immunity from
prosecution.
The question of immunity is properly before this Court.
Direct proceeds of crimes against the laws of the United
States cannot be considered as income within the meaning of the Income Tax Law of 1921. Eisnerv. Macomber,
262 U. S.189; Steinberg v. United States, supra;Smith v.
Minister of Finance, 2 Dom. L. Rep., reversed by Privy
Council.
MAI. JusTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The defendant in error was convicted of wilfully refusing to make a return of his net income as required by
the Revenue Act of 1921; November 23, 1921, c. 136,
§§ 223 (a), 253; 42 Stat. 227, 250, 268. The judgment
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 15 F. (2d)
809. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.
We may take it that the defendant had sufficient gross
income to require a return under the statute unless he
was exonerated by the fact that the whole or a large

part of it was derived from business in violation of the
National Prohibition Act. The Circuit Court of Appeals
held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor were subject
to the income tax, but that the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution protected the defendant from the requirement of a return.
The Court below was right in holding that the defendant's gains were subject to the tax. By § 213 (a) gross
income includes "gains, profits, and income derived from
the transaction of any business carried on for
profit,
or gains or profits and income derived from
gain or
any source whatever." These words are also those of
the earlier Act of October 3, 1913; c. 16, § II, B; 38 Stat.
114, 167, except that the word 'lawful' is omitted before
'business' in the passage just quoted. By § 600; 42
Stat. 285, and by another Act approved on the same day
Congress applied other tax laws to this forbidden traffic.
Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, § 5; 42 Stat. 222, 223.
United States v. One Ford Coup6, 272 U. S. 321, 327.
United States v. Stafoff, 260 U. S. 477, 480. We see no
reason to doubt the interpretation of the Act, or any
reason why the fact that a business is unlawful should
exempt it from paying the taxes that if lawful it would
have to pay.
As the defendant's income was taxed, the statute of
course required a return. See United States v. Sischo,
262 U. S. 165. In the decision that this was contrary to
the Constitution we are of opinion that the protection
of the Fifth Amendment was pressed too far. If the
form of return provided called for answers that the
defendant was privileged from making he could have
raised the objection in the return, but could not on that
account refuse to make any return at all. We are not
called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld. Most of the items warranted no complaint. It
would be an extreme if not an extravagant application
