ent to find it out in a month or two if anything was
wrong. Careful people generally look over their bank
accounts rather frequently.
It is very desirable that the decision of the Courts of
the United States and that of the highest Court of the
State where the business was done, should agree, as was
recognized by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The result
to which we come restores that agreement, at least when
the checks are certified or accepted by the banks upon
which they are drawn, as was the case here with all but
two. Whiting v. Hudson Trust Co., 234 N. Y. 394. The
certification did not import a statement by the certifying
bank that, besides the right of the son to draw, established
by the power of attorney, the purposes for which the
checks were drawn were lawful and were known by the
bank. As the Court remarks in the case cited "The transactions of banking in a great financial center are not to be
clogged, or their pace slackened, by over-burdensome restrictions." 234 N. Y. 406.
Judgment reversed.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 771.

Argued May 2, 1927.-Decided May 31, 1927.

Under his power "to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against
the United States" (Const. Art II, § 2), the President may commute a sentence of death to life imprisonment, without the convict's consent. Burdickc v. United States, 236 U. S. 79, limited.

Argument for Perovich.

Mr. George T. McDermott, with whom Mr. Robert
Stone was on the brief, for Perovich.
Except in the military forces, or where martial law
exists, a person may not be punished for an offense except
after a verdict of a jury and a sentence by a court. The
President cannot deprive a person of his liberty. Const.
Art. III, § 2; Amendments V, VI; Marbury v. Madison,
1 Cr. 138; Little v. Barreme,2 Cr. 170; Ex parteMilligan,
4 Wall. 122.
The President has power to pardon, reprieve, or commute. Commutation is an exercise of power, and not of
grace; it is effective without delivery to, acceptance by, or
consent of the prisoner. Commutation is a lessening of
the same kind of punishment. The President may not
substitute one kind of punishment for another-a jail sentence for a fine, or deportation instead of imprisonment.

The only legal punishment for murder in the first
degree is death, unless the jury qualify their verdict by
adding "without capital punishment." Life imprisonment is a different kind of punishment than death, and
cannot be substituted without consent. Criminal Code,
§ 275; U. S. Comp. Stats., §§ 10448, 10504.
Pardon is an exercise of grace, and not of power;
delivery and acceptance are required to make it effective;
any conditions may be attached which the President
pleases, and acceptance of the pardon is an acceptance
of the conditions. The President may pardon from a
death sentence, on condition that the prisoner accept life

States, 236 U. S. 79; Ross v. McIntyre, 140 U .S. 453.
Solicitor General Mitchell, with whom Mr. Robert P.
Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on
the brief, for Biddle, Warden.
The rule that a pardon must be accepted to be effective
originated in a statement in the opinion in United States
v. Wilson, 7 Pet. 150. That case merely followed the
English rule that an executive pardon is a private act of
which the courts can not take notice unless pleaded and
proved. It is not authority for the proposition that a
pardon may be rejected and execution of his sentence
insisted on by the convict.
The correct rule is that no exercise of the pardoning
power requires acceptance except a true conditional pardon, which imposes a condition not known to the law and
which requires voluntary action by the prisoner, but since
an individual pardon by executive action is a private act
of which the courts may not take judicial notice, a failure
of the accused and of the prosecution to bring it properly
to the attention of the court may make it ineffective, and
in that limited way only may it be said the accused can
reject it.
The English authorities, before and since Wilson's case,
have never held otherwise. None of the large number of
American state courts which have, obiter, repeated the
statement in Wilson's case, that all pardons must be accepted to be effective, has ever so held in a case presenting
the question. The only real authority in support of the
necessity of acceptance is Burdick v. United States, 236
U. S. 79, decided on the supposed authority of United
States v. Wilson. The rule that a convict has the right
to insist on execution of his sentence overlooks the para-

mount public interest and places too much emphasis on
the preferences of the convict. It is not well supported
by reason. If the question decided in Burdick's case is
not reconsidered, at least the rule should not be extended

Commutations of sentence have always been held not
to be governed by the rule that pardons require the consent of the prisoner. In that view the question here is
whether the change from death penalty to life imprisonment was a commutation or a conditional pardon.

considered a less severe punishment than death, and
should be so considered by the courts. The narrower
view that a commutation is merely a reduction in the
degree of the punishment without any change in kind is
not supported by the weight of authority. The statute
under which Perovich was convicted provided life imprisonment as an alternative penalty for the crime of
murder, and life imprisonment was therefore a milder
punishment known to and prescribed by law for his
offense.
The act of executive clemency was therefore a commutation of punishment and not a conditional pardon. A
conditional pardon is one imposing a condition precedent
or subsequent not known to the law, and which from its
very nature requires voluntary action by the accused to
make the pardon effective. In re Victor, 31 Oh. St. 206;

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
has certified questions of law to this Court upon facts
of which we give an abridged statement. Perovich was
convicted in Alaska of murder; the verdict being that he
was 'guilty of murder in the first degree and that he
suffer death.' On September 15, 1905, he was sentenced
to be hanged; and the judgment was affirmed by this
Court. 205 U. S. 86. Respites were granted from time
to time, and on June 5, 1909, President Taft executed a
document by which he purported to "commute the sentence of the said Vuco Perovich
. to imprisonment for life in &penitentiary to be designated by the
Attorney General of the United States." Thereupon
Perovich was transferred from jail in Alaska to a penitentiary in Washington, and, some years later, to one in
Leavenworth, Kansas. In November, 1918, Perovich, reciting that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment, applied for a pardon-and did the same
thing again on December 10, 1921. On February 20,
1925, he filed in the District Court for the District of
Kansas an application for a writ of habeas corpus, on
the ground that his removal from jail to a penitentiary,
and the order of the President, were without his consent
and without legal authority. The District Judge adopted
this view and thereupon ordered the prisoner to be set
at large. We pass over the difficulties in the way of this
conclusion and confine ourselves to the questions pro-

486

posed. The first is: "Did the President have authority
to commute the sentence of Perovich from death to life
imprisonment?"
Both sides agree that the act of the President was
properly styled a commutation of sentence, but the counsel of Perovich urge that when the attempt is to commute a punishment to one of a different sort it cannot be
done without the convict's consent. The Solicitor General presented a very persuasive argument that in no case
is such consent necessary to an unconditional pardon
and that it never had been adjudged necessary before
Burdick v. United States, 236 U. S. 79. He argued that
the earlier cases here and in England turned on the necessity that the pardon should be pleaded, but that when
it was brought to the judicial knowledge of the Court
"and yet the felon pleads not guilty and waives the pardon, he shall not be hanged." Jenkins, 129, Third Century, case 62.
We will not go into history, but we will say a word
about the principles of pardons in the law of the United
States. A pardon in our days is not a private act of
grace from an individual happening to possess power. It
is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it
Is the determination of the ultimate authority that the
public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than
what the judgment fixed. See Ex parte Grossman, 267
U. S.87, 120, 121. Just as the original punishment would
be imposed without regard to the prisoner's consent and in
the teeth of his will, whether he liked it or not, the public
welfare, not his consent, determines what shall be done.
So far as a pardon legitimately cuts down a penalty, it
affects the judgment imposing it. No one doubts that a
reduction of the term of an imprisonment or the amount
of a fine would limit the sentence effectively on the one
side and on the other would leave the reduced term or

fine valid and to be enforced, and that the convict's
consent is not required.
When we come to the commutation of death to imprisonment for life it is hard to see how consent has any
more to do with it than it has in the cases first put. Supposing that Perovich did not accept the change, he could
not have got himself hanged against the Executive order.
Supposing that he did accept, he could not affect the
judgment to be carried out. The considerations that led
to the modification had nothing to do with his will. The
only question is whether the substituted punishment was
authorized by law-here, whether the change is within
the scope of the words of the Constitution, Article II,
§ 2: "The President . . . shall have Power to grant
Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United
States, except in Cases of Impeachment." We cannot
doubt that the power extends to this case. By common
understanding imprisonment for life is a less penalty than
death. It is treated so in the statute under which Perovich was tried, which provides that "the jury may qualify
their verdict [guilty of murder] by adding thereto 'without capital punishment'; and whenever the jury shall
return a verdict qualified as aforesaid the person convicted shall be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor
for life." Criminal Code of Alaska, Act of March 3, 1899,
c. 429, § 4; 30 Stat. 1253. See Ex parto Wells, 18 How.
307; Ex parte Grossman, 267 U. S. 87, 109. The opposite
answer would permit the President to decide that justice
requires the diminution of a terni or a fine without consulting the convict, but would deprive him of the power
in the most important cases and require him to permit
an execution which he had decided ought not to take
place unless the change is agreed to by one who on no
sound principle ought to have any voice in what the law
should do for the welfare of the whole We are of opin-
