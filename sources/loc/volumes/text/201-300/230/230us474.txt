as that presented in the Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352, and the
decision is the same.
Where an act fixing rates and imposing penalties for violation is repealed by a subsequent act which saves the penalties and simply
substitutes other rates, the essential features of a controversy involving the constitutionality of the statute are the sa ne; and, under
the circumstances of this case, a supplemental bill may be filed setting
up the new and additional legislation and praying relief in regard
thereto.
Where the ends of justice are advanced arid no substantial rights of
suits which were submitted to the court below upon the proofs. The
court below enjoined the rates as being confiscatory.
On the appeals in these nine suits (there being an appeal and crossappeal in each case) this court sustains the rates as to six companies,
to wit: the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa 'Fe, the Kansas City Southern, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas,
the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific (including the St. Louis, Kansas
City & Colorado), and the St. Louis & San Francisco.
In the cases of these companies, the decrees are reversed and the
eases remanded with instructions to dismiss the bills, respectively,
without prejudice.
The court holds the rates to be confiscatory in three of the nine
cases whose appeals were heard, to wit: the St. Louis & Hannibal, the
Kansas City, Clinton & Springfield and the Chicago Great Western.
In these three cases, the decrees are affirmed, with the modification
that the Railroad Commissioners and the Attorney-General of the
State, may apply to the court whenever it shall appear that by reason
of a change in circumstances the rates fixed by the State's acts are sufficient to yield reasonable compensation.
Under the stipulations made in the court below, the decision sustaining the rates as to the six companies above-mentioned will also
apply to six other companies, to wit: the St. Louis Southwestern, the
Missouri Pacific, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern, the Wabash,
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, and the Chicago & Alton, see
p. 509, post.
The decision in the case of the Chicago Great Western Company,
holding the rates to be confiscatory, will also apply by virtue of the
stipulations made below to the Quincy, Omaha & Kansas City Railroad Company and the St. Joseph & Grand Island Railway Company.
For other cases involving Missouri rates, see pp. 509, 512, post.

the objectors are violated, this court will not interfere with the reasonable discretion of the trial judge in a matter of practice.
Where the Federal court already has jurisdiction of an action to determine the coastitutionality of a, state statute fixing rates, that jurisdiction is not ousted by a substitution of rates by the legislature,
because the Sta:te files a bill to enforce the new rates; the Federd
court retains jurisdiction under a supplemental bill.
Minnesota Rate Cases, atite, p. 352, followed to effect that the legislative
acts of Missouri establishing maximum rates for transportation
wholly intrastate are not unconstitutional as an unwarranted interference with interstate coiimmerce.
Legislative acts of a State establishing maximum freight and passenger
rates for wholly intrastati' comnmerce will not be declared unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment as confiscatory in the
absence of clear and convincing proof as to the value of the property
used by the carrier and on which returns are based. General evidence as to assessed valuations without showing the method of appraisement are insufficient, either as to value of property or apportionnient of expenses between interstate and intrastate business.
Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352, followed, disapproving the establishnient of values of property used in interstate and intrastate business by apportionment based on the gross revenue received from
each class of business.
Where a number of different carriers bring separate suits to enjoin the
enforcement of railway rates established by a state statute on the
ground that the rates are unconstitutional as confiscatory, the bills
can be sustained as to those carriers which actually prove that the
rates arc confiscatory as not yielding a return on their property, although dismissed as to other carriers which fail to offer clear and convincing proof to that effect.
Where a statute is valid on its face, each person attacking it as depriving him of his property without due process of law must show it do(es
so deprive him; he cannot rely on the fact that it deprives others (of
their property without due process of law.

mum passenger fare act passed February 27, 1907, Laws,
p. 170, to be confiscatory, and enjoining their enforcement. 168 Fed. Rep. 317.
Eighteensuits, brought by as many railroad companies,
were begun in June, 1905, assailing the act of April 15,
1905 (effective June 16, 1905), which prescribed maximum
rates for intrastate transportation of certain commodities
in carload lots. The members of the Board of Railroad
Commissioners, the Attorney-General of the State, and
representative shippers, were made defendants.
Preliminary injunction was granted in each case, demurrers to the bills were overruled, answers were filed and
in March, 1906, the cases were referred to a master to
take evidence and report. The Master proceeded, by
agreement, to take testimony in three of the cases.
While this reference was pending, the legislature in
1907, passed the following acts:
(1) That of February 27, 1907, fixing a maximum passenger fare within the State of two cents a mile, for railroads 6ver forty-five miles in length.
(2) That of March 19, 1907, repealing the act of April 15,
1905, and prescribing new maximum intrastate rates for
specified commodities in carload lots, the rates being
higher in certain instances than those of the f6rmer act.
It also repealed an act passed April 15, 1905 (not mentioned in the original bills) relating to rates on stone, sand
and brick, and made new rates therefor. It was provided
that the repeal should not relieve any railroad company
from liabilities and penalties previously incurred.
(3) That of March 19, 1907 (Laws 1907, p. 187), fixing
maximum rates for fruit in carload lots.
(4) That of April 4, 1907 (Laws 1907, p. 176), requiring
carriers of live stock in carload lots to carry the shipper
or his ageit free of charge. (This statute was held unconstitutional by the state court and needs no further notice.

Statement of the Case.

These acts took effect on June 14, 1907.
On June 11, 1907, the complainant in each of the eighteen cases moved for leave to file an amended and supplemental. bill, then presented to the court, which set forth
the legislation of 1907, above-mentioned, and asked relief
against its enforcement upon the grounds that these acts
constituted an unwarrantable interference with interstate
commerce and that they were confiscatory. On June 13,
1907, the court made an order setting down the applications for argument and meanwhile restraining the enforcement of the new rates. On June 17, 1907, upon hearing,
leave to file was granted and a temporary injunction was
allowed as to the freight rate laws of 1907, but not as to
the passenger fare law. The latter was permitted to go
into effect for three months without prejudice and was
thereafter continued in force until the final decrees.
Meanwhile on June 14, 1907, bills were filed in the name
of the State in the state court against the railway companies seeking an injunction requiring them to put in
force both the freight and passenger rates as prescribed.
The supplemental bills in the Federal courts were
amended so as to show these proceedings. On demurrer
to these bills, as amended, it was insisted that they were
Without equity; that the matters alleged were not germane to or supplementary, of the original bills; and that
the state court had jurisdiction of the proceedings therein
instituted. The demurrers were overruled and the defendants answered.
It was ordered (June 13, 1908) that the eighteen cases
should be set down for hearing before the court upon the
testimony theretofore taken before the Master, -and upon
such further oral and documentary evidence as should
then be offered in open court. And the cases were so
heard.
With respect to eight of the suits, it was stipulated Lhat
they should abide the result in other suits named,

Argument for R. R. Comm.

The case of the St. Louis, Kansas City & Colorado
Railroad Company was consolidated with that of the
Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific.Railway Company, the
latter having acquired the property of the former, and
the court ordered that the "findings, statements and
figures" of the two companies should be combined. In
the suit brought by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
Railway Company, then the lessee of the property, the
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company was
substituted as complainant on the cancellation of the lease.
In the nine cases thus remaining, the court held that
the rate acts, both of 1905 and 1907, were invalid, as
confiscatory. The contention as to the invalidity of the
acts by reason of interference with interstate commerce
was not sustained. The costs were equally divided.
And from the final decrees-entered in these nine suits,
the above-entitled appeals and cross-appeals were takefn.
Mr. Elliott W. Major, Attorney General of Missouri,
Mr. Sanford B. Ladd and Mr. F. W. Lehmann, with whom
Mr. John AT. Atkinson, Assistant Attorney General of
Missouri, was on the brief, for the Railroad and Warehouse Comissioners of the State of Missouri, appellants
in the appeals and appellees in the cross-appeals:
The two-cent passenger fare act and maximum freight
rate acts involved do not incerfere with nor constitute a
direct and substantial burden upon interstate commerce.
Ours is a dual form of government. Howard v. Ill.
Cent. R. R. Co., 207 1. S. 463; Sands v. Manistee River

21 Wall. 485; In re Debbs, 158 U. S. 564; Cardwell v.
Bridge Co., 113 U. S. 210.
Each State has the sole and exclusive authority to prescribe reasonable maximum passenger and freight rates on
traffic wholly within the State.
It is a legal impossibility for state rates on intrastate traf-

ic to change interstate rates. If, however, it were legally
possible for state rates to change or interfere with interstate rates, it is no objection to the validity of such laws
that such rates incidentally affect interstate commerce.

The two classes of rates and traffic, interstate and intrastate, are separate, distinct and independent, and the
raising or lowering of one cannot affect the other.

roads to change the other, and the roads cannot plead
their own convenience oir business reasons or the effect of
competition between themselves in restraint of the otherwise undeniable power of the State. Ames v. Union Pac.

The opinion in Shepard v. Northern Pao. Ry. Co., 184
Fed.Rep. 765, is without precedent, is a radical departure,
a legal impossibility, and is founded upon neither law,
logic nor reason. The opinion itself is its own undoing.
Intrastate and interstate commerce constitute two
separate, distinct and independent classes, and the rates
of each are fixed and controlled by separate sovereignties.
The change in the rates of one by the state and in the
other by Federal authority only operates upon and affects
its own separate, distinct and independent class of commerce.
The enforcement of the passenger and freight rate acts
in question would not, in fact, have the effect of directly
and substantially burdening interstate commerce. Chic.

183 U. S. 79, 91, 97; Reagan v. Farmers' L. & T. Co., 154
U. S. 362, 395.
The burden of proving that the state laws are confiscatory rests upon the railroad company which must establish that the rates are confiscatory, clearly, unmita'kably
and beyond all doubt. San Diego Land Co. v. National
City, 174 U. S. 739; Willcox v. Cons. Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19;

Nor. Pac. Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 216 U. S. 579.
All doubts must be resolved in favor of the validity of
the freight act and passenger fare law involved and if
the court is in doubt one way or the other as to the laws
giving a fair return upon the reasonable valuation of the
properties employed, that doubt sustains the laws. Bridge

has done with the receipts and earnings of the company
on its entire business in the State, and must not only give
the amount showing the disposition of its revenues, but
must give the items thereof; its expenses in general statements and in large sums will not be accepted so that the
court may not be misled into doing grievous wrong to the
public. Chic. & Grand Trunk R. R. Co. v. Wellman, 143
U. S. 739.
The service rendered by the road is an element which
must be considered in determining the questions, because
the 'road can only demand what the services rendered by
it are reasonably worth. Minn. & St. L. R. R. Co. v.
Minnesota, 186 U. S. 257; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466.
Each case must be heard and determined upon its own
particular facts and evidence. Reduction in rates does
not necessarily mean reduction in revenue. They may
have increased business volume and therefore increased
earnings. Smyth v. Ames; Chic. Grand Trunk R. R. Co. v.
Wellman, supra; St. L. & San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Gill,
156 U. S. 649.
In three cases only, Reagan v. Farmers' L. & T. Co.,
154 U. S. 362; Covington Turnpike Co. v. Sanford, 164
U. S. 578; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, has this honorable court held rates fixed by'legislative bodies for public
service corporations confiscatory. In each of the three
cases the facts were either admitted or not seriously
controverted, and can be distinguished from this case.
This court, on the other hand, has refused in thirteen or
more cases to hold such rates invalid on account of being
unreasonable and confiscatory. San Diego Land Co. v.

Cons. Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19; Nor. Pac. Ry. Co. v. North
Dakota, 216 U. S. 579.
There are numerous factors necessary to know in order
to determine whether or not the rates, both freight and
passenger, are confiscatory or afford a reasonable return,
including: the reasonable value of the properties employed
in the business; the reasonable value of the properties
less the franchise; the amount of the value assignable to
state freight traffic; the amount of the value assignable
to state passenger traffic; gross amount of revenue received; the gross amount of revenue received from state
freight traffic; the gross amount of revenue received from.
state passenger traffic; total amount of expense; amount
of expense assignable to state freight traffic; amount of
expense assignable to state passenger traffic; taxes assignable to freight traffic; taxes assignable to passenger traffic;
amount of diminution in revenue if freight acts had been
in effect.
Each and every one of these factors must be established
by affirmative proof on the part of the road.
Appellants' briefs show the total value of the properties
of the various railroad companies in Missouri, together
with the separate amounts of that, part of the valuation
assignable to state freight and stale passenger traffic
and upon which separate values they are entitled to a
reasonable return. The railroad companies, however, are
nlot, entitled to any return upon that part of the valuation
represented by their franchise.
Appellants challenge the correctness of the findings of
the trial court, the method of dividing the operating expense betwe en state and interstate traffic, the amount of
operating expense charged to Missouri, the character of
evi(ence received, the absence of primary or best evidence,

although within the keeping of the railroad, and like questions as applied, first, to freight rates, and, second, to
passenger rates.
The court should not have divided the total freight
expense between state and interstate traffic upon the
basis of gross revenue; and certainly should not have
added 50 per cent. to the expense of handling state freight
in addition thereto. Ames v. Union Pac. R. R. Co., 64
Fed. Rep. 182; Chic., Mil. & St. P. R. R. Co. v. Tompkins,
176 U. S. 176; Atlantic Coast Line v. Ellis, 203 U. S.
256, 260.
Total expenses should not have been divided between
state and interstate traffic upon the basis of gross earnings,
As to freight traffic it should have been divided on the
ton-mile basis and as to passenger traffic on the passenger
miles and service rendered.
It costs more to handle interstate freight less than carload lots than it does state freight less than carload lots.
The railroad officers and employ6s who testified in this
case were forced to admit the correctness of the ton-mile
theory.
The courts condemn the gross revenue theory and
properly proceed upon the basis of the ton-mile theory.
Mr. Frank Hagerman, with whom Mr. 0. M. Spencer
was on the brief, for the Railroad Companies, appellees
and cross-appellants:
The court below found the rates to be confiscatory.
This finding was made from 5027 printed pages of evidence
;pecifically applicable to all roads traversing the same
territory. In the light of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the case, great weight should be given to the
finding. It surely was as effective as like action by a
master would have been. Especially is this -true in view
of the extended inquiry of the experts, their long oral crossexaminations and the reasons given for their methods of

S.

dividing expenses and their determination that it costs
more to do the state than the interstate business. This
court cannot possibly be in as good a situation to pass
upon the facts found as was the court below.
The State had every opportunity to ascertain the facts.
Besides this, the law presumed it ascertained all the facts
before it attempted to fix the rates by legislative enactment. If it failed so to do, the legislative acts should not
be permitted to stand.
The State refused to request any finding of fact or point
out any error or inaccuracy therein.
The evidence discloses that the rates in question are
confiscatory. Every presumption is in favor of the finding below (Shepard v. Nor. Pac. R. Co., 184 Fed. Rep.
765, 807, 808), which must be sustained unless the record
shows there has been some clear misconception of the
evidence or misapplication of the law. This is applicable
to masters' reports, Tilghman v. Proctor, 125 U. S. 126,
149; Callaghan v. Nyers, 128"U. S. 617; Furrer v. Ferris,
145 U. S. 132; Fisher v. Shropshire, 147 U. S. 133, 146,
especially where the reference was by consent. Warren
v. Burt, 58 Fed. Rep. 101, 106.
Here, by agreement, the court heard the case upon

The rates in question on any and all classes of business
are absolutely confiscatory unless, to obtain as between
state and interstate business, the original or equal cost
of each, there be a division of freight expenses upon the
ton-mile basis. When this is done, the freight rates are
confiscatory unless a very large percentage be added as
the extra cost.
The rates are confiscatory. This conclusion was reached
by the court below; and the method of ascertaining their

As a start upon the question of valuation, there must
be ascertained the value of the whole property in the
State devoted to all its uses. Presumptively, the bonds
and stocks properly apportioned, represent that value.
Ames v. Union Pac. R. Co., 64 Fed. Rep. 165, 177; So.
Pac. R. Co. v. Bartine, 170 Fed. Rep. 725, 751. However,
included therein as elements of value, are the income,
good-will, franchises, cost of construction, action of the
State equalizing board, and other considerations, such as
the company being a going concern.
For the rule under which this valuation is to be determined, see Ames v. Union Pac. R. Co., 64 Fed. Rep. 165,

.In any event, interest actually paid should always be
returned. Bonded debt upon which for years interest
has been paid; as in these cases, is substantial evidence of
value. Interest upon bonds of a going concern is at least
a criterion of a higher value than the amount of the
bonded debt. C., M. & St. P. R. R. v. Tompkins, 90 Fed

Unless the property is clearly shown to have been overbonded, then interest is a fixed charge which ought in any
event to be paid. That there was no over-bonding is .the
express finding below. Where money has been borrowed
and mortgage bonds issued therefor, upon which for
years interest has been paid, no court has ever yet denied
that such charge was at least to be paid. Beaie & Wyman

The only way in which to ascertain what part of this
value is properly assignable to the classes of traffic in
question is by taking such proportion of the entire value
as the earnings from that class of business which is in
question bears to the entire revenue in the State from all

revenue basis, it being the method used by all railroads
where it has been necessary to divide expenses as between
state and interstate. The best railway experts in the
world favored it, giving many reasons for their views.
There is a substantial extra cost of doing state business
over interstate, which should be deducted from the earnings.
.If the division were made differently, the result would
be the same. The Nebraska, North Dakota, South
Dakota and Oklahoma divisions were by the same method.
The Minnesota and Arkansas divisions of expenses upon
final hearing prove that the theory adopted below brought
a fair result.
The laws under which the rates were to be imposed
are invalid: they directly affect interstate commerce and,
therefore, violate the Federal Constitution, which vests
in Congress exclusively the regulation of interstate commerce. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123; M., K. & T. R.
Co. v. Love, 177 Fed. Rep. 493, 498; AShepard v. Nor. Pac.
R. Co., 184 Fed. Rep. 765.
The making of state rates in Missouri necessarily and
directly affects interstate rates for that competition forces
the interstate rates to the same figures. The state rate
necessarily fixes the interstate.
When there are two lines between the same points, like
the C., B. &.Q., and Mo. Pac., between St. Louis and St.
Joseph the interstate rate must be fixed at the same as the
state or else the intersfate carrier will do no business between the same points.
Where points are practically the same (for instance, as
Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas) with
nothing but a street or invisible state line intervening, the
interstate rate must necessarily meet the state; otherwise
there would be discrimination between localities.
Any law, no matter what its form, which substantially
and directly affects or interferes with interstate commerce,

growth of commerce among the States and the-method of
handling all commerce indiscriminately on the same trains,
whether intrastate or interstate, so that whenever local

The compelling force of competition in the adjustment
of interstate rates to meet state-made rates demonstrates
the direct effect of such rates upon interstate commerce.
Competition is a distinct and most important factor
in the making and adjustment of rates. As a vital force
in transportation, it is controlling and irresistible if traffic
is to be transported by a given line between points where
there axe other transportation lines, either rail or water.
The law of competition is just as forceful in commerce
as the law of gravitation is over matter. Int. Comm. Comm.

M.

JUSTICE HUGHES,

1. The contention of the appellants that the court
erred in permitting the filing of the amended and supplemental bills is without merit. Although the commodity
rate act of 1907 repealed that of 1905, it saved the penalties and liabilities incurred under the repealed statute.
Both the original and supplemental bills proceeded upon
the broad ground that the returns of the companies from
their intrastate business, prior to the act of 1905, were
unreasonably low and that any reduction in rates would

only diminish the income already inadequate. The additional legislation pending the suits, and the substitution of slightly higher rates on certain commodities
embraced in the earlier act, did not alter the essential features of the controversy. There was identity of parties
and subject-matter, although nominally different acts
were involved. To have required original bills would
have involved double litigation, double costs and great.
delay. The ends of justice were advanced by allowing
the amended and supplemental bills and we are not inclined to interfere with the reasonable discretion of the
trial judge in a matter of practice which in no way violated any of the substantial rights of the appellants.
Neither can it be said that the state court had prior
jurisdiction. That the State filed in one of its courts
bills for the enforcement of the act of 1907, before the
actual filing of the supplemental bills, may be true; but
the application for leave to file the supplemental bills
was pending in the Circuit Court of the United States
and action was suspended; merely to give opportunity
for hearing, the court meanwhile restraining the enforcement of the new rates. In view of the pending bills assailing the act of 1905, the substantial identity of the
question arising under the acts of 1907, and the pendency
of the motion for leave to file supplemental bills, we are
clearly of opinion that priority of jurisdiction belonged
to the United States and the state court could not properly
oust that jurisdiction.
2. It is insisted by the cross-appellants that the legislative acts, although relating exclusively to intrastate
transportation, constituted an unwarrantable interference
with interstate commerce and that the decrees should
have afforded relief upon this ground. We need not
review the arguments addressed to conditions of transportation in Missouri and the relation of intrastate to
interstate rates for while the case has its special facts by

iISSOURI RATE CASES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

reason of the location of the State, and the use of the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers as basing points in ratemaking, the controlling question thus presented with
reference to the authority of the State to prescribe reasonable intrastate rates throughout its territory, unless
limited by the exercise on the part of Congress of its
constitutional power over interstate commerce and its
.instruments, is not to be distinguished in any material
respect from that which was considered and decided in the
Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352. For the reasons stated
in the opinion in those cases, it must be held that the court
below properly refused to sustain this objection to the
Missouri statutes.
3. We are thus brought to the question whether the
-action of the State was confiscatory, that is, whether by
the reduction in rates of which complaint is made, the
carriers were denied the just compensation to which they
were entitled for the use of their property in the public
service. It is to be observed that the freight rate acts of
1907 applied only to a.portion of freight transportation,
that is, to the transportation of specified commodities
in carload lots. But, as we have said, it is contended that
the return from the intrastate business was already inadequate and that the scope of the State's action in the
passage of the passenger fare act and the commodity
rate acts was such as necessarily to preclude a fair return
upon that business taken as a whole. If it be assumed
that the question of the profitableness of the entire
intrastate operations is thus presented, the inquiry leads
at once to a consideration of the fair value of the property
devoted to the public use.

the valuations placed respectively upon the properties by
the state assessing board, for the purpose of taxation,
multiplied by three.' The multiplication was made because the assessments were on the basis, of one-third of
the value in the judgment of the state board. In the case
of two of the companies, the St. Louis & Hannibal and
the Kansas City, Clinton & Springfield, the value as found
was equal to twice the assessed valuation, that is, the value
was taken to be two-thirds of the estimate of the assessing
board.
None of the members of the state assessing board was
examined. There is no satisfactory proof of the grounds
of their judgment. Nor was it shown that these valuations, made by them for the purposes of taxation, were
upon a basis which could properly be taken in determining
the fair value, where the sufficiency of prescribed rates is
involved and the issue is one of confiscation.
It is urged that there was other evidence in support of
the conclusions reached. The court below, while finding
values equal to those estimated by the state assessing
board, also found that apart from the valuations of the
state board, and upon the whole evidence, the property
was at least worth the amounts mentioned in the findings.
It was said that there had been considered "the immense
terminal values of most of the roads, the amount of stock
and bonds outstanding, what it would cost to duplicate
the properties both with and without terminals in the
large cities, and all the evidence bearing on present
v'alues."
& Pacific, Kansas City Southern, Missouri, Kansas & Texas, and Chicago Great Western.
In certain instances there are slight differences which appear to be
accounted for by additions to the state assessments of certain local ah-,
sessments.

But in every instance, tihe value as found corresponds to

what was assumed to be three times the assessed valuation in the statements of computations submitted to the court.

MISSOURI RATE CASES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Cofirt.

On examining the evidence, however, we ind it to be
too general and inconclusive to be regarded as sufficient
proof to. sustain the values as found. Undoubtedly, the
companies possessed valuable terminals, but what the
values were was not suitably shown. There is an absence
of evidence, appropriately specific, dealing with the lands,
improvements, structures, equipment and other property
owned by each company and showing what the various
items of property were worth. It would seem manifest
from the character of the evidence which can be supposed
to have relation to value, that reliance was principally
placed upon the estimates of the state assessing board.
There was proof of the amount of stocks and bonds, of
earnings, and also testimony as to the cost of certain
recent construction, but while these matters could properly be considered in reaching a conclusion, we fail to
find any adequate basis for the definite findings of value
that have been made. We are referred to the testimony
of two witnesses for the complainants, men of considerable
experience in railroad affairs, but this consisted of broad
estimates. Thus, one of these witnesses testified as
follows:
"Q. I want to ask you a question as to the Rock Island,
the St. Louis & Hannibal, the Kansas City Southern, the
M. K. & T., the Kansas City, Clinton & Springfield, and
the Chicago Great Western. In speaking of'the Rock

"Now I want to ask you the general question as to each

and all of those roads, whether in your opinion each of
those roads is worth an amount equal to three times the
valuation fixed by the State Board of Equalization in
those years-at least that much?
"A. Yes sir, in a general way I should say the value
of those roads is at least three times the amount shown
in the report of the State Board of Equalization of Missouri, for the years 1907 and 1908. I have examined both
books, and substantially there is not very much difference.
"Q. I do not remember whether we gave the Frisco
figures for 1907 or for 1908. But you make them applicable to all the roads you have testified to, as to both
1907 and 1908, do you?
"A. Yes sir, with the exception possibly of the St.
Louis & Hannibal and of the Kansas City, Clinton &
Springfield. I am not certain as to those roads being
worth three times the assessed value, as shown in the
printed report of the proceedings of the State Board of
Equalization.
"Q. As to each of those roads, which are losing ventures any way, according to the testimony here, about
what would you say they are worth, at least how much?
"A. Well, I should say twice as much as the assessed
valuation.
"Q. Your statement, with the exception you make as
to the St. Louis & Hannibal, and the Kansas City, Clinton
& Springfield Railroads, is applicable to all the roads whose
cases have been tried here?

fiscation or to justify the annulment of the legislative acts
of the State.
In the case of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Company, the value of the property in the State of Missouri
was fixed at the amount of $53,172,907.83. This amount,
as stated in the exhibit of computations submitted by the
company to the court, was precisely three times "the
assessment for 1908" ($17,724,302.61), the assessment,
being made upon the basis of one-third of the board's estimate. The court found that the mileage in Missouri
was 1136.34 miles and that the value as fixed amounted
to $46,793 a mile. If this-yaluation were extended to the
mileage of the. entire system, it would mean that for the
purpose of determining the validity of prescribed rates
and the issue of confiscation, the Burlington property as
a whole should be regarded as worth over $400,000,000.
According to the evidence, as stated in the brief of counsel
for the company, the actual bonded indebtedness of the
company at the time in question was $174,172,000 and.
its stock, $110,839,100, making a total of $285,011,100.
In short, the contention would be, on this basis of valuation extended to the system, that unless the Burlington
were permitted to calculate its fair return upon an amotn I
exceeding by more than $115,000,000 its total capitaliza,tion, it would be deprived of its property without due
process of law.
Manifestly, a finding of confiscation could not be based
on such a valuation in the absence of clear and convincing
proof that the value actually xisted and that the different
items of property were estimated respectively by correct
methods and in accordance with proper criteria of value.
This proof was lacking. In the case of the other roads,
although the special considerations which have been
mentioned with respect to the Burlington property may
not be applicable, stij we are left in uncertainty as to the
correctness of specific valuations which have been made.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

It cannot be regarded as sufficient to introduce assessments, or valuations made for the purposes of taxation;
and this is particularly true when the principles governing
the assessments are not properly shown, and for all that
appears, they may have rested upon methods of appraisement which would be inadmissible in ascertaining the
reasonable value of the property as a basis for charges to
the public. Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352.
There is a further question, and that is, whether these
estimates of value which the court below adopted in its
findings were accepted by the defendants and hence are
not open to objection here. It is undoubtedly true that
these estimates were used in the computations, on both
sides, which were submitted to the court. The amounts
assessed respectively were conceded and it was also agreed
that the assessments were made at one-third the value in
the judgment of the board. Concessions of this sort were
made at various times during the taking of evidence and
the following extracts from the record are sufficient, we
think, to show their nature.
Thus, with respect to the Burlington road, on the
original bill, the following stipulation 'was made before the
Master:
"It is agreed between the parties that the basis of the
assessment is upon the basis of one-tnird of the value of
the property, in the judgmnnt of the Board."
And later, on the hearing before the court on the
amended and supplemental bills, the following took
place:
"Mr. Hagerman: We have a stipulation in the other
three cases that the State Board of Railroad and Warehouse assessment was based upon one-third of what they
regarded as a 3.3 per cent. valuation.
"General Hadley: Whatever the stipulation was, it
would be equally applicable to the other fifteen roads as
it was to the three.

MISSOURI RATE CASES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"The Court: If you are able to make an agreed statement now, better do so.
"Mr. Hagerman: I would like to get the fact, whatever
it may be.
"The Court: Who assesses the railroads?
"Mr. Hagerman: The state officers.
"Mr. Lehmann: We do not accept that as indicating the
real value because under the law the State Board is required to take into account a great many things, the
amount of the bonds and the stock, the franchises, the
income of the property, and the income might be unduly
high, and upon that basis give an unduly high valuation
to the property.
"Mr. Hagerman: I did not ask you to admit that is the
value of itself, but that the State Board valuation is fixed
by them upon three times the amount of the returns.
"Mr. Lehmann: We object to That as immaterial and
irrelevant.
"Mr. Hagerman: Will you admit it subject to the ob~jection?
"General Hadley: My recollection is that the stipulation or understanding was that the State Board assessment was one-third of what they regarded as the value of
the property, including the franchise.
"Mr. Hagerman: One-third of the value as listed in the
statement. I shall follow it by the introduction of a
statement.
"General Hadley: That is all right."
Our conclusion is that the stipulation extended only to
the fact that the judgment of the board was as stated.
While the evidence on the question of value, considering
the character of the issue involved, was extremely unsatisfactory and these estimates based upon the assessments were used by both parties in the aleulatiois which
were submitted to the court, still it, cannot be said thai,
there was an agreement as to the values. Nor did the

court in. making its findings procced upon the view that
the values had been stipulated. 'We can entertain 'no
doubt upon this record that the defendants are free to
urge, as they do urge, that the values as found are not
supported by the proof.
It is not necessary to consider the merits of the contention based on the assumption that in the item of the
assessment entitled "All other property" the state
assessors included franchises of the companies. There is
no clear showing as to what they did include in this item.
As we have said, they were not called as witnesses and
in many essential particulars we are unable to judge upon
what basis they made their specific appraisements.
4. The value of the entire property within the State, as
found, was apportioned between the interstate and intrastate business, passenger and freight, according to the
gross revenue derived from each.
The reasons for disapproving this method were stated
in the Minnesota Rate Cases, ante. p. 352, and the ruling
there made is controlling here.
5. A large part of the controversy relates to the division
of expenses between the interstate and intrastate traffic.
It is contended by the defendants that the division should
hatve been made with respect to freight according to the
relation of ton-miles, and that the passenger expense
should have been diivided according to the relation of
passenger-miles, or, to include another factor upon which
the defendants insist, according to passenger-miles and
"service rendered," meaning by the latter that the
quality of the service should be taken into account.
The court made the division in each case upon the basis
of gross revenue with an addition for the extra cost of
intrastate traffic, this being estimated at not less than
fifty per cent. in the case of freight and not less than
twenty-five per cent. in the case of passengers.
It is evident that in an apportionment of expenses

MISSOURI RATE CASES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Coutt.

either upon the revenue method, or upon the ton-mile
and passenger-mile method, relations may be assumed
which do not in fact exist. Thus, a division of expenses
according to gross revenue assumes that the cost in relation to revenue is the same with respect bqth to intrastate
and interstate traffic; in fact, it may be very different.
A greater average sum may be charged for intrastate than
for interstate hauls; and this greater sum may or may not
be equal to the difference in cost. In the Minnesota cases,
the Master found that the revenue per ton per mile derived from intrastate business as compared with interstate business, was, with respect to the Northern Pacific
company, as 1.4387 to 1.0000, and with respect to the
Great Northern company, as 2.02894 to 1.00000. And,
there is further illustration in the present case, it appearing, for example, that in the case of the St. Louis & San
Francisco company, the revenue per ton per mile from
the intrastate business, as compared with the iriterstate
business was as 1.7286 to 1.0000; and in that of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy company, approximately as
2 to 1. An apportionment of expenses on the basis of
revenue which did not take into consideration the differences in revenue in relation to cost in the two classes of
traffic would be plainly inaccurate.
On the other hand, a division according to ton-miles
assumes that the cost of moving a ton of intrastate freight
one mile is the same on the average as the cost of moving
a ton of interstate freight one mile. If the average cost
differs in the two classes of traffic, the difference must be
allowed for in order to make a correct apportionment
of the total expense.
When the apportionment is on the revenue basis, with
an allowance such as was made by the court below for the
assumed extra cost of intrastate traffic, it is manfest that
the purpose is to express in a given percentage the additional cost of intrastate traffic in proportion to rev(wnue.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

This was clearly illustrated in the computations made
by the Master in the Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352.
The Master concluded that the cost per ton-mile of doing
intrastate freight business was two and one-half times
that of doing interstate freight business. The division of
expenses was then made according to ton-miles after increasing the intrastate ton-miles two and one-half times.
To reach the same result on the revenue basis it was necessary to ascertain the relation of cost per ton-mile in proportion to revenue, and for this purpose, for example, in
the Northern Pacific case, the relation of cost per tonmile (2.5 to 1.0) was divided by the relation of revenue
per ton-mile (1.4387 to 1.0000) and the relation of cost in
proportion to revenue was thus found to be as 1.7377 to
1.0000. The division of expenses was then made upon
the revenue basis after multiplying the intrastate revenue by 1.7377; and the result, of course, was identical
with that obtained upon the ton-mile basis as already
stated.
The allowance of 50 per cent. (which was made below)
for the extra cost corresponds in its nature to the 73.77
per cent. allowed in the Minnesota Case on the "equated
revenue basis." If, for example, it were assuned that it
cost three times as much per ton-mile to do the intrastate
freight business as the interstate, and the revenue per
ton-mile of the former was twice that of the latter, the
cost in proportion to revenue would be 50 per cent. more.
Or, if the assumption were that the intrastate freight
business cost two and one-half times as much per tonmile as the interstate, and the revenue per ton-mile of
the former, as compared with the latte', was as 1.66 to
1.00 (as it is said to be in the case of the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe company) the extra cost in proportion to
revenue would be substani ially 50 per cent.
As the counsel for the railroad companies says in his
brief, the court below "took the estimates of two to four

MISSOURI RATE CASES.
230-U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

times extra cost given by witnesses, and because of extra
state or short-haul revenue per mile and other considerations, red-aced them to 50 per cent., saying that this as
a minimum added to the equal division upon the revenue
basis, brought to each road a result that was fair, just and
representative."
We have then in substance the same question that was
presented in the Minnesota Cases with respect to the evidence of the additional cost of transacting the intrastate
business. There are numerous expressions of judgment
on the part of the witnesses as to the amount of the intrastate cost, some estimating it on the revenue basis and
others on the ton-mile basis. The estimates took a similarly wide range, making the cost of the intrastate or
short-haul business from two to eight or more times that
of the interstate or long-haul business. There was also
testimony on each side as to certain tests, but these
covered only a few days. We can reach no different conclusion from that stated in the decision to which we have
referred, that, in an issue of this character involving the
constitutional validity of state action, general estimates
of the sort here submitted with respect to a subject so
intricate and important should not be accepted as adequate proof to sustain a finding of confiscation. Minnesota
Rate Cases, ante, p. 352.
For the reasons that have been set forth, we must conclude that, save in the cases mentioned below, the complainants failed to sustain their bills.
The exceptions are these: In the case of the St. Louis &
Hannibal company, operating, as found by the court below, 120.61, miles within the State, the net revenue from
the entire Missouri business, interstate and intrastate, for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, appears to have been
$15,687.18. In the case of the Kansas Ciy, Clinton &
Springfield company, operating 151.01 miles within the
State, the net revenue from the entire business therein,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the- Court.

230 U. 9.

interstate and intrastate, for the same year amounted to
$32,500.72. In each of these cases the experts employed
by the parties -unite in the statement that it is apparent
from the results shown that "upon neither the revenue
nor ton-mile nor passenger-mile theory of expenses can
any adequate retprn on the investment be earned."
In the case of the Chicago Great Western company,
operating 84.43 miles of road within the State, the entire
net revenue from the Missouri business, interstate and
intrastate, for the six months ending December 31, 1907,
being the period taken by both parties for the purpose of
calculation, amounted to $41,839.06. From our exanination of the evidence atnd the various computations we are
satisfied in this case, as in the two others above-mentioned,
that errors attributable either to valuation or to apportionments cannot be regarded. as sufficiently great to
change the result.
The decrees in these three cases will accordingly be
affirmed, with the modification that the Railroad and
Warehouse Commissioners, and the Attorney-General of
the State, may apply at any time to the court by bill or
otherwise, as they may be advised, for a further order
.or decree whenever it shall appear, that by reason of a
change in circumstances the rates fixed by the State's act s
are sufficient to yield to these companies reasonable colnpensation for the services rendered.
The contention raised by the complainants,, that these
legislative acts cannot be enforced against one company
unless enforced against all, cannot be sustained. The
argument, in effect, is that although the charge' of carriers may be clearly exorbitant, the State is'powerless to
compel them to put into effect reasonable rates because
as to another carrier differently situated the ratesthus
prescribed might be unreasonably low. *The acts are
valid upon their face as a proper exercise of governmental
authQrity in the establishment of reasonable rates, and
