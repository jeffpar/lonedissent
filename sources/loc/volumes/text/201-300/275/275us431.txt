N. & G. TAYLOR COMPANY, INC., v. ANDERSON
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 114.

Argued December 5, 1927.-Decided January 3, 1928.

1. Section 18 of the Illinois Practice Act, allowing the assignee of a
non-negotiable contract to sue on it in his own name and requiring
him to show on oath his ownership and source of title, will be
applied by the federal courts sitting in that State. P. 437.
2. By the law of Illinois, as established by the State Supreme Court,
a declaration under § 18 supra that does not make the required
showing as to ownership and source of title, fails to state a cause
of action; and a cause of action set forth in a declaration amended
to comply with the section is barred if the period fixed by the
statute of limitations has expired when the amended declaration
is filed. P. 437.
3. Section 954 of the Revised Statutes governing amendments in the
federal courts, is to be liberally construed. P. 438.
4. Where the filing of an amended declaration has been allowed
under § 954, the question whether the declaration states a new
cause of action barred by the statute of limitations, depends upon
the substance of the change made by the amendmefit. P. 438.
5. A partnership made a contract to purchase oil and vendors
defaulted. The members of the partnership formed a corporation, named as the partnership was with the word "Incorporated" added, which took over the firm's assets and liabilities,
including the contract, and carried on the business. The corporation sued on the contract in the federal court sitting in Illinois,
describing it as one made with the corporation directly, without
mention of the partnership, and later, when the period of the

statute of limitations had expired, filed an amended declaration
claiming as assignee. Held that the amendment was not one of
form, which could relate back to the beginning of the action, but
substituted a new cause of action barred by the statute. P. 439.

CERTIORARI, 273 U. S. 681, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals which affirmed a judgment of the District Court sustaining a plea of the statute of limitations
in an action on contract brought in Illinois by a Maryland
corporation.

Mr. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., with whom Messrs. Robert
W. Childs, Walter E. Beebe, and Edwin A. Lucas were on
the brief, for petitioner.
Admittedly plaintiff's declaration, as amended, fully
satisfied the requirements of the local practice, as construed by the Illinois courts. The Illinois decisions which
the majority of the court below felt bound to follow did
not involve the construction of § 18 of the Practice Act,
which is too clear for construction; but dealt with the
question as to what constitutes a different cause of action-a matter of general fundamental law-and with the
effect of amendments-a matter regulated by the federal
statutes.
Federal courts are not bound by state decisions relative
to the allowance and effect of amendments. The federal
courts recognize that there may be both a defective and a
proper statement of the same cause of action, and that
the insertion*of an allegation which did not "set up any
different state of facts as the ground of action," M. K. &
T. R. v. Wulf, 226 U. S. 570, did not state a new cause of
action, but "merely expanded or amplified what was
alleged in support of the cause of action already asserted."

exercising this power, do not depend on state statutes or
on state practice. Bowden v. Burnham, 59 Fed. 752;
Mexican Cent. Ry. v. Duthie, 189 U. S. 76; Illinois
Surety Co. v. Peeler, 240 U. S. 214; Norton v. Larney,
266 U. S. 511.
Amendments, when allowed, relate back to the date of
the filing of the pleading which they amend. Missouri
etc. R. R. Co. v. Wulf, 226 U. S. 570; Underwood Co. v.
Davies, 287 Fed. 776.
The present cause of action accrued direct to the plaintiff corporation, which stepped into the shoes of the partnership while the contract was being performed and before the breach was complete, and took the place of the
partnership in the performance of the contract. It was
not until March 20, 1917, when plaintiff refused further
to condone defendants' scanty deliveries and wrote that
they would buy this oil elsewhere, that this cause of action
accrued, and it then accrued to the corporation.
There was no assignment to a distinct third party. The
two partners merely changed the form of their organization. Even this change was complete before the final
breach by defendants, which breach was with the plaintiff
corporation.
When a defendant, from the institution of the suit, has
been fully advised by the pleadings as to the particular
transaction on which the claim is based, the federal courts
do not permit him to defeat a just claim merely because of
the original omission of some fact, which, while necessary
to a complete technical cause of action or required to make
the pleadings conform to state practice, was totally unnecessary to advise defendant adequately of the essential
nature and basis of the claim. Cf. American R. R. v.
Birch, 224 U. S. 547; and M. K. & T. Ry. v. Wulf, 226
U. S. 570. See also Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, 240 U. S.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Respondents.

275 U. S.

R. R. v. Kinney, 260 U. S. 340. These decisions of this
Court make it clear that the assertion by suit of the cause
of action, effective to toll the statute, consists in a clear
statement of the basic facts on which the claim is founded,
and not in a mere statement or elaboration of the history
of the controversy, or of the precise capacity in which the
plaintiff sues.
The federal decisions are full of instances in which
the courts of the United States, acting pursuant to the
broad powers and discretion conferred by § 954, have
refused to permit a party to defeat a just claim by taking
advantage of a mere error in pleading by the other side,
not affecting the substantial rights of the parties and
not discovered until after the limitation period had expired. McDonald v. Nebraska, 101 Fed. 171; Willitts
& Pattersonv. Texas Refining Co., 2 F. (2d) 547; Middlesex Banking Co. v. Smith, 83 Fed. 133; Dittgen v. Racine
Paper Co., 164 Fed. 85, 171 Fed. 631; Johnson & Co. v.
Staenglen & Muller, 85 Fed. 603; Patillo v. Allen West
Co., 131 Fed. 680; Quaker City Cab Co. v. Fixter, 4 F.
(2d) 327; Van Doren v. Penna.R. R., 93 Fed. 260; Railroad v. Horst, 93 U. S. 291.
Mr. Hobart P. Young for respondents.
What the plaintiff corporation took over from the partnership was a cause of action which then existed in favor
of the partnership and against the defendants for damages for breach of contract during the months of November and December, 1916. What happened in March,
1917, was merely that the corporation notified the defendants that it had terminated the contract because of
the poor performance in the matter of deliveries. The
present cause of action did not accrue to the plaintiff
corporation.
If the plaintiff acquiesced in the failure to make deliveries until March 20, 1917, then only such damages as
accrued subsequent to that date and until the end of

TAYLOR CO. v. ANDERSON.
431

Opinion of the Court.

the term of the contract, which was June 30, 1917, could
be recovered. If no claim accrued until March 20, 1917,
then no claim existed which N. & G. Taylor Co., the copartnership, could have assigned to the corporation on
February 1, 1917.
Under the Illinois decisions, the plaintiff stated a new
cause of action in the amendment. Allis-Chalmers Mfg.
Co. v. Chicago, 297 Ill. 444; Gallagher v. Schmidt, 313
Ill. 40. The Illinois decisions are not mere inferences
from § 18 of the Practice Act.
There was no attempt, not even a defective attempt,
to state a cause of action under the statute. Had the
plaintiff's declaration stated that it was the actual, bona
fide, owner of the chose in action, but had omitted to
state how and when it obtained title, there would-have
been a defective statement, fatal under the Illinois decisions; but assuming that, under the federal decisions,
it would be held that this could be cured by amendment
without being barred by the statute of limitations, yet
such a holding would not help the plaintiff in error here,
because that question is not in this case.
The decisions of the supreme court of a State construing its practice acts are binding on the federal courts.

JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

N. & G. Taylor Company, a partnership composed of
Taylor and Justice, had long been engaged in the manu-

facture of tin plate. November 1, 1916, respondents and
that partnership entered into a contract by which the
former agreed to furnish, in fairly equal monthly quantities, and the latter agreed to take and pay for the fuel oil
required by it, estimated at 1,200,000 gallons, for the eight
months ending June 30, 1917. On January 31, 1917, the
partners caused petitioner to be organized, giving it the
name of the partnership with the word "Incorporated"
added. As of February 1, 1917, the corporation assumed
the liabilities of the partnership and took over all its
property and has since carried on the business.
The petitioner commenced this action in the northern
district of Illinois, eastern division, March 7, 1918. The
declaration alleged an agreement between respondents and
petitioner for the delivery of the oil, a breach by respondents, and resulting damage. No reference was made to
the partnership, the contract between it and respondents,
the subsequent creation of petitioner or its acquisition of
the business. At the trial in May, 1924, petitioner by
leave of court filed an amended declaration alleging that
respondents and the partnership made an agreement for
the oil in question; that on February 1, 1917, petitioner
became the owner of all the assets of the firm including
the agreement and all rights appertaining to it; that respondents failed and refused to deliver the oil either prior
to February 1, 1917, to the partnership or afterwards to
the petitioner-except approximately 40,000 gallons which
was delivered to the partnership-and that thereby petitioner itself and as successor of the firm was subjected to
great loss. Section 18 of the Illinois Practice Act (c. 110,
Cahill's Revised Statutes, 1927) provides that the assignee
of any chose in action not negotiable may sue thereon in
his own name, "and'he shall in his pleading on oath, or
by his affidavit, where pleading is not required, allege that
he is the actual bona fide owner thereof, and set forth how

Opinion of the Court.

and when he acquired title

.

."

In order to comply

with that provision, the petitioner filed the affidavit of its
president stating that, on February 1, 1917, it took over
the partnership assets including the contract and a right
of action against respondents for its breach from the time
it went into force to January 31, 1917.
Respondents, by plea to the amended declaration, set
up a statute of Illinois (Revised Statutes, c. 83, § 20) declaring that, when a cause of action has arisen in another
State "and by the laws thereof an action thereon cannot
be maintained by reason of the lapse of time, an action
thereon shall not be maintained in this State," and one of
Pennsylvania (§ 13,857 Pennsylvania Statutes) providing
that actions on contracts must be commenced within six
years from the time the right of action accrued; and alleged that the cause of action arose in Pennsylvania more
than six years before the filing of the amended declaration
and was barred by the laws of both States. The trial
court held that the amended declaration stated a new
cause of action and that it was barred, directed a verdict
and gave judgment for the respondents. The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed. 14 F. (2d) 353. This Court
granted a writ of certiorari. 273 U. S.681.
Section 18 of the Illinois Practice Act will be applied in
the courts of the United States sitting in that State. R. S.
§ 914. Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co., 133 U. S.
473, 488. In the absence of such a provision an assignee
of a non-negotiable chose- in action could 'not sue in his
own name. Glenn v. Marbury, 145 U. S.499, 509. The
advantage conferred is taken subject to the terms specified, and the assignee must make the required showing in
respect of ownership and source of title. It is established
by the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois that in
an action under that section a declaration that does not
state that plaintiff is the actual bona fide owner thereof

and set forth how and when he acquired title fails to state
a cause of action. And it is also held that a cause of
action set forth in a declaration amended to comply with
that section is barred if the period fixed by the statute of
limitations has expired when the amended pleading is
filed. Applying the state law, it must be held that the
amended declaration set up a new cause of action which
was then barred. Gallagherv. Schmidt, 313 Ill. 40; AllisChalmers Mfg. Co. v. Chicago, 297 Ill. 444.
Petitioner invokes R. S. § 954 providing that any court
of the United States may at any time permit either of the
parties to amend any defect in the pleadings upon such
conditions as it shall in its discretion and by its rules prescribe. And it contends that federal courts allow such
amendments independently of state enactments and decisions, and that here the amended declaration complied
with § 18 of the Illinois Act, but stated no new cause of
action.
Section 954 governs amendments and is to be liberally
construed. Norton v. Larney, 266 U. S. 511, 516, and
cases cited. But the propriety of the filing of the
amended declaration is not involved as permission was
granted on the application of the petitioner. The substance of the change is to be regarded. In any view, a
new cause of action was brought in more than six years
after it accrued. The original declaration alleged an
agreement between respondents and petitioner and set it
out in haec verba. It was a letter dated November 1,
1916, addressed to "N. & G. Taylor Company" and signed
by respondents. The words "Accepted: N. & G. Taylor
Co." appeared at the end of the letter. That declaration
did not attempt to state a cause of action under § 18 of
the state Practice Act. Petitioner did not sue or claim as
assignee. No reference was made to the contract between
respondents and the partnership. The cause of action

TAYLOR CO. v. ANDERSON.
431

Opinion of the Court.

there stated never existed. The amended declaration
states a cause of action for breach of the, contract that
was made by the partnership. It cannot be treated as
curing a defective statement of a cause of action theretofore attempted to be set up. Cf. Illinois Surety Co. v.
Peeler, 240 U. S. 214, 222. The change was not merely
one of form; the fundamental substance of the claim was
different. Cf. Friederichsenv. Renard, 247 U. S.207, 213.
It is clear that the amended declaration substituted a new
cause of action. Petitioner cites and relies on Mo., Kans.
& Tex. Ry. v. Wulf, 226 U. S. 570. But that case does not
support its contention. There the amendment, allowed
after the expiration of the period prescribed by the statute
of limitations, related to form and not to the substance of
the cause of action. The court said (p. 576): "It introduced no new or different cause of action, nor did it set up
any different state of facts as the ground of action,
and therefore it related back to the beginning of the
suit."
And it is plain that six years had expired when the
amended declaration was filed. Respondents were in default when petitioner took over the business, February 1,
1917. That appears from the allegations of the amended
declaration as well as from the supporting affidavit. The
contract covered fuel oil required in a period ending June
30, 1917. The action was commenced March 7, 1918; the
cause of action had then accrued. The amended declaration was filed May 14, 1924, more than six years after the
action was commenced. It cannot be deemed to relate
back as it brought in a new cause of action, which must be
treated as commenced at the time the amended declaration was filed. Union Pacific Railway v. Wyler, 158 U. S.
285, 296, et seq.; Salyers v. United States, 257 Fed. 255,
259.
Judgment affirmed.
