KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY
v. ELLZEY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 63.

Argued October 24, 25, 1927.-Decided November 21, 1927.

1. By the doctrine of the last clear chance a negligent defendant will
be held liable to a negligent plaintiff if the defendant, aware of the
plaintiff's peril, had in fact a later opportunity than the plaintiff
to avert an accident. But where as a result of the negligent operation of a railway motor car by defendant's agent, with plaintiff's
acquiescence or encouragement, the car was derailed and plaintiff
injured, their courses of conduct were not so independent that either
one or the other could be said to have had in fact a later opportunity to avoid the consequences of their joint negligence, and the
doctrine was therefore inapplicable. P. 241.
2. Instructions in such a case held sufficiently favorable to the plaintiff
on the subject of contributory negligence. P. 242.
12 F. (2d) 4, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 271 U. S. 659, to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed a judgment entered
on a verdict in the District Court in favor of the Railway
Company in an action for personal injuries brought
against it by Elizey. The jurisdiction of the District

Court was based on diversity of citizenship.

Mr. Frank H. Moore, with whom Messrs.' A. F. Smith,
John D. Wilkinson, C. Huffman Lewis, W. Scott Wilkinson and S. W. Moore were on the brief, for petitioner.
If Merchant was negligent, and plaintiff directed or
acquiesced in that negligence, he was also negligent and
assumed the risk of injury from the negligent conduct in
which he participated. Harding v. Jesse, 189 Wis. 652;
Henderson v. Penna., etc. Co., 179 Fed. 577; Davis v.
Chicago, etc. Co., 159 Fed. 18; Bradley v. Mo. Pac. R.

Argument for Petitioner.

If it were possible that in such circumstances negligence of Merchant might be a proximate cause, and
plaintiff's negligence a remote cause, then the question
of whether or not plaintiff's negligence was a proximate
cause would be one for the jury; and the charge clearly
and repeatedly pointed out to the jury that the plaintiff's negligence must be a proximate cause of the accident
to bar his recovery.
There was no warrant for an instruction based upon
the last clear chance doctrine. St. L. & S. F. Ry v. Schumacher, 152 U. S. 77; Wheelock v. 'Clay, 13 F. (2d) 972;
Chunn v. City etc. Ry., 207 U. S. 302; St. L. & S. F. R. Co.

Plaintiff's status as passenger, or otherwise, was properly left to the jury. Even if a passenger, his contributory negligence would bar his right of recovery. Elder

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Respondent.

275 U. S.

Mr. S. P. Jones, with whom Mr. 0. W. Bullock was on
the brief, for respondent.
Ellzey was a passenger for hire on the car. See Drovers
Pass cases: I. & St. L. Ry. v. Horst, 93 U. S. 291; Phila.&
Reading Ry. v. Derby, 14 How. 486; N. Y. Cent. Ry. v.
Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357; Norfolk Sou. Ry. v. Chatman,
244 U. S. 276. The operator of a carriage can not by heeding the urge of the passenger place the burden of contributory negligence upon him. The passenger is presumed not to have equal information with the carrier,
either as to the safetr of the conveyance or the speed it
is capable of making with safety. Weish 4ar v. S. S. Co.,
128 Fed. 397; Lynn v. Sou. Pac. Co., 24 L. R. A. 710;
Hutchinson, Carriers, 2d. ed., § 654 c; Little v. Hasket,
116 U. S. 371. The right to make a direct contract against
negligence being denied by law, there can be no implied
contract relieving the carrier by attempting to class it as
contributory negligence growing out of the passenger's
suggestion of fast driving. If Ellzey was guilty of contributory negligence in urging fast running, Merchant
knew it, and it was his duty to protect Ellzey against his
own negligence. 10 C. J., § 1490, p. 1107; Inland Co. v.
Tolson, 139 U. S. 558; Penna R. R. v. Reed, 60 Fed. 694;
Norfolk Term. Co. v. Rotolo, 191 Fed. 4.
Even if the plaintiff could have been guilty of negligence in the encouragement of the speed, he certainly
could not relieve the carrier by passively failing to protest. If any such theory as passive contributory negligence could apply to a passenger, it would have to appear
that he knew and appreciated the danger, (and not that a
person of ordinary care would have known and appreciated the danger), had an opportunity to avoid its consequences, and failed to do so. The doctrine of imputed
negligence applies to injuries inflicted by third persons
and not to injuries inflicted by the carrier. It is the duty

Opinion of the Court.

of the carrier to protect the passenger against his own
negligence instead of acquiescing in his negligence to his
injury. Hutchinson, Carriers, 2d ed., § 654 c; Weishaar v.
Kimball Co., 128 Fed., 397, certiorari denied, 194 U. S.
638; Lynn v. Sou. Pac. Co., 24 L. R. A. 710. If Ellzey had
been guilty of contributory negligence in urging Merchant
to drive the car to Leesville, or in urging him to increase
the speed, the subsequent negligence of the defendant in
running the car at a high rate of speed was the proximate
cause of the injury. 6 Cyc. 641; Rodley v. London Ry.,
1 App. Cas. 754, 46 L. J. Exch. 573; 35 L. T. Rep. (N. S.)
637; Chunn v. Washington Ry., 207 U. S. 302; Inland Co.
v. Tolson, 139 U. S. 558; Norfolk Term. Co. v. Rotolo,
112 C. C. A. 585; 192 Fed. 4.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent, a United States deputy marshal, was assigned to guard Merchant, a telegraph lineman employed
by petitioner, from violence by strikers. He went with
Merchant to repair a telegraph line and while returning
with him on a motor car over petitioner's railroad the car
was derailed and respondent injured. Respondent brought
the present suit in the district court for western
Louisiana to recover for his injuries. The trial by jury
resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendant, the
petitioner here. The court of appeals for the fifth circuit,
12 Fed. (2d) 4, reversed the judgment, holding that an
instruction to the jury by the trial judge was erroneous.
There was evidence from which the jury could have
found that the accident and injury were caused by the
negligent operation of the motor car by Merchant at a
dangerously high rate of speed. There was also evidence
from which it might have found that respondent contributed to his own injury either by urging Merchant to driveat excessive speed or by failing to object to Merchant's

240

275 U. S.

obvious negligence. That part of the charge designated
by the court below as erroneous is as follows:
"If you should find that in this case the plaintiff urged,
directed or counseled the driver of the car to run it at a
reckless and high rate of speed, and that as a result of such
reckless running [of] the car was injured, then that would
be contributory negligence which would bar his recovery;
or if he saw that the car was being negligently run, in such
a manner as with the knowledge that he had before him at
the time a man placed in his position must reasonably
have known that to continue in the situation he was in
was dangerous without protesting or desisting and removing himself from the perilous situation at the earliest
possible moment, then that would be an act of omission
which would contribute to the injury, and would in law
constitute contributory negligence."
The court of appeals, in holding this instruction improper, pointed out portions of the evidence indicating
that respondent's conversations with Merchant, relied on
to show that he urged or advised Merchant to drive the
motor car at a dangerous rate of speed, took place at Carson and later at De Ridder, on petitioner's line, and that
the accident occurred after leaving De Ridder and while
proceeding north from that point to Leesville. It pointed
out also that under the quoted instruction the respondent
could not have recovered if the jury found that he had
voluntarily remained on the car after he saw it was being
negligently run. The court considered this erroneous,
saying:
"Though the plaintiff was negligent in the respect
stated, if, as evidence adduced indicated, the defendant's
employee was aware of such negligence in'time to have
avoided the injury by the use of reasonable care, and he
-failed to use such care, that failure might be found to be
the sole proximate cause of the injury, and plaintiff's
negligence be deemed a remote cause. Chunn v. City &

KANSAS CITY SOU. RY. v. ELLZEY.
236

Opinion of the Court.

Suburban Ry., 207 U. S. 302 . . . . The plaintiff's
right to recover was not barred if his negligence was only
a remote cause of his injury, and Merchant's negligence
was the sole proximate cause of it."
This language suggests that the circuit court of appeals
thought this case to be governed by the doctrine of the last
clear chance. That doctrine, rightly applied in the Chunn
case, amounts to no more than this, that a negligent defendant will be held liable to a negligent plaintiff if the
defendant, aware of the plaintiff's peril or unaware of it
only through carelessness, had in fact a later opportunity
than the plaintiff to avert an accident. Grand Trunk Ry.
v. Ives, 144 U. S. 408, 428; Inland and Seaboard Coasting
Co. v. Tolson, 139 U. S. 551, 558. In the cases applying
the rule the parties have been engaged in independent
courses of negligent conduct. The classic instance is that
in which the plaintiff had improvidently left his animal
tied in a roadway where it was injured by the defendant's
negligent operation of his vehicle. Davis v. Mann, 10
M. & W. 546. It rests on the assumption that he is the
more culpable whose opportunity to avoid the injury was
later.
On the facts assumed by the circuit court of appealsthat Merchant was driving the car recklessly with respondent's encouragement or acquiescence--the respondent and Merchant were engaged in a common venture
which, acting together, they were carrying on in a careless
manner. In such a case their courses of conduct are not
sufficiently independent to let it be said that either one
or the other had in fact a later opportunity to avoid the
consequences of their joint negligence. Compare St
Louis & San Francisco Ry. v. Schumacher, 152 U. S. 77;
Wheelock v. Clay, 13 Fed. (2d) 972; Kinney v. Chicagoi
Great Western R. R., 17 Fed. (2d) 708; Denver City
Tramway Co. v. Cobb, 164 Fed. 41.
We think that the doctrine of the last clear chance was
not involved here. If the jury found negligence on the
83583-28-:16

Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

part of the defendant, then their verdict turned on
whether they thought the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence. Whether the instructions were
sufficient in this respect is the only substantial question
before us. The trial judge charged generally, in various
forms, that respondent's negligence, as a bar to recovery,
must be found to have contributed "proximately" to the
injury, and that if respondent counseled Merchant to run
the car at a reckless rate of speed, and by reason of his
encouragement Merchant negligently operated the. car
and as a result of that negligent operation the injury
occurred, "or if he saw that the car was being negligently
run, in such a manner as with the knowledge that he had
before him at the time a man placed in his position must
reasonably have known that to continue in the situation
he was in was dangerous without protesting or desisting
and removing himself from the perilous situation at the
earliest possible moment, then that would be an act of
omission which would contribute to the injury, and would
in law constitute contributory negligence." Again the
jury was instructed that respondent "would not be held
to have assumed the risk of an injury resulting from the
defendant's negligence merely because the plaintiff failed
to interpose his judgment against that of the defendant,
unless you.find that a man of ordinary care and prudence,
so situated, would have abandoned the car."
We think these instructions and others of similar import, read as we must read them in the light of the whole
charge, were sufficiently favorable to the respondent on
the subject of contributory negligence. Perhaps it would
have been permissible to tell the jury that, though respondent had at an earlier moment encouraged or acquiesced in Merchant's recklessness, he might still recover if
later and before the accident he repented and asked Merchant to drive carefully. But the court's failure to do
so, in the absence of a specific request, seems to us not to
be ground for reversal.

Syllabus.

The respondent suggests here numerous other objections to the charge as given. We have considered them
and find that they present no substantial question requiring further comment. The judgment of the district
court is affirmed and that of the court of appeals is
Reversed.
LEWELLYN, COLLECTOR, v. ELECTRIC REDUCTION COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF-APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 71.

Argued October 26, 1927.-Decided November 21, 1927.

1. The rights of a buyer who has prepaid a seller for merchandise
which the latter has failed to deliver are upon contract and are
not a "debt" where neither party has abandoned the contract;
the prepayment is therefore not deductible, in arriving at net
income under Revenue Act of 1918, § 234 (5), as a "debt ascertained to be worthless and eharged off within the taxable year."
P. 246.
2. When the seller proved to be irresponsible, the buyer's loss could
be deducted under § 234 (4) as a "loss sustained during -the taxable
year," i. e., the year in which his claim proved to be worthiess.
P. 246.
3. Plaintiff, in 1918, paid in advance for goods which were never delivered. He did not charge off the amount in that year on his books,
but continued to carry it in a "bills receivable" account. The
worthlessness of the claim was proved by the outcome of litigation
two years after the payment. He then sought, under Subsection
(4), § 234, Revenue Act of 1918, to deduct the amount of the payment in an amended tax return for 1918. Held, that the deduction
was not allowable because the loss was not "sustained" during that
taxable year. P. 247.
4. Trial by jury having been waived in writing, review of this case
is limited to the sufficiency of the facts specially found to support
the judgment and to the rulings excepted to and presented by the
bill of exceptions, Rev. Stat. §§ 649, 700. The Court is without
power to grant a new trial except for error thus presented. P. 248,
11 F. (2d) 493, reversed,
