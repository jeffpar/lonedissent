CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.

No. 30.

Argued April 14, 18, 1927.-Decided October 10, 1927.

1. Claims arising out of contracts with the Emergency Fleet Corporation are not within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General.
P. 4.
2. The Fleet Corporation is an entity distinct from the United States
and from any of its departments or boards; and the audit and
control of its financial transactions is, under the general rules of,
law and the administrative practice, committed to its own corporate officers except so far as control may be exerted by the
Shipping Board. P. 11.
3. The power to settle and adjust claims arising from contracts made
and cancelled by the Fleet Corporation under the power delegated
by the President under the Acts of June 15, 1917, and April 22
and November 4, 1918, is conferred by § 2(c) of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1920, on the Shipping Board. P. 11.
4. The requirement of Rev. Stats., § 951, that in suits by the United
States against individuals no claim for a credit shall be admitted
unless it shall have been presented to the accounting officers of the
Treasury and by them disallowed, is satisfied when the claim is presented and disallowed by the officer who has power to allow the
claim, although he is not a general accounting officer of the Government. P. 12.

275 U. S.

CERTIORARI, 270 U. S. 626, to a judgment of the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia which affirmed the
Supreme Court of the District in dismissing a petition for
a writ of mandamus, which was sought by Skinner &
Eddy in order to compel the Comptroller General to pass
upon its claims against the Government, growing out of
contracts with the Emergency Fleet Corporation.
Mr. Louis Titus, with whom Mr. J. Barrett Carterwas
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell was
on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a petition for a writ of mandamus brought in
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in October,
1924. The relator, Skinner & Eddy Corporation, seeks to
compel the Comptroller General to pass upon its claims
against the Government. These arise under contracts
made during the years 1917, 1918 and 1919 with the
United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. Most of the contracts refer to the corporation as
"representing the United States." The claims were presented to the Comptroller General for allowance, because
Skinner & Eddy wished to be in a position to use them as
a credit, if the United States should, as was threatened,
sue on the contracts. It deemed this course necessary,
because § 951 of the Revised Statutes (United States
Code, Title 28, § 774) provides: "In suits brought by the
United States against individuals, no claim for a credit
shall be admitted, uipon trial, except such as appear to
have been presented to the accounting officers of the
Trmesury? for their examination, and to h,.ve been by then

disallowed
. " Compare United States v. Fisher
Flouring Mills Co., 295 Fed. 691; 17 F. (2d) 232. The
Comptroller General declines to consider the claims, asserting that he has neither the duty, nor the power to do
so; and that the duty of passing upon them rests with the
Shipping Board.
In 1923, the Fleet Corporation assigned to the United
States, all of its assets, including accounts against divers
persons for the payment of money. Thus, the United
States is the owner, either as principal or as assignee of the
Fleet Corporation, of all the claims against Skinner &
Eddy. Two actions arising out of these contracts are now
pending in the federal court for the Western District of
Washington. One is a suit by Skinner & Eddy against the
Fleet Corporation -begun in 1923 in a state court of Washington and removed to the federal court. In that case,
the defendant has moved to dismiss the suit on the ground
that the claim sued on is one against the United States.'
The other action is a suit by the United States against
Skinner & Eddy, commenced in the federal court since
this petition for a writ of mandamus was filed.
The question whether the writ of mandamus should
issue is presented by. a demurrer to the plea and traverse
which was interposed to the answer. The Supreme Court
of the District sustained the demurrer and dismissed the
petition without opinion. Its judgment was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals of the District, 8 F. (2d) 1011. This
Court granted a writ of certiorari. 270 U. S. 636. The
Government insists that the' petition was properly dismissed, because claims arising out of contracts with the
Fleet Corporation are not within the jurisdiction of the
Comptroller General; and that even if they were, the
I In 1923, Skinner & Eddy began still another suit, upon the same
cause of action, against the United States in the Court of Claims. It
was finally allowed to dismiss that suit without prejudice. See In re

relief was properly denied, because his refusal to consider
the claims was a disallowance thereof within the meaning
of § 951, and thereby the requirement of that section was
satisfied. It is conceded that mandamus is an appropriate
remedy. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v.
Humboldt S. S. Co., 224 U. S. 474.
The first contention involves a determination of the
powers and duties of the Comptroller General and of the
United States Shipping Board in respect to claims arising
out of transactions of the Fleet Corporation. The powers
and duties formerly " imposed by law upon the Comptroller of the Treasury or the six auditors of the Treasury Department" were transferred to the Comptroller
General by Act of June 10, 1921, c. 18, Title III,
§§ 301-304, 42 Stat. 20, 23, 24, (United States Code,
Title 31, § 44). Section 305, amending § 236 of the
Revised Statutes, provides: "All claims and demands
whatever by the Government of the United States or
against it, and all accounts whatever in which the Government of the United States is concerned, either as
debtor or creditor, shall be settled and adjusted in the
General Accounting Office." 2 The language of this grant,
if standing alone, might possibly be broad enough to include authority to audit accounts and to pass upon claims
The accounting branch of the Treasury Department was created
by the Act of September 2, 1789, c. 12, §§ 1, 3, 5, 1 Stat. 65, 66.
Steps in its growth and in the development of its control over Government expenditures may be traced in the Acts of May 8, 1792, c. 37,.
§ 1, 1 Stat. 279; July 16, 1798, c. 85, § 1, 1 Stat. 610; March 3, 1817,
c. 45, §§ 1,3-5, 3 Stat. 366,367; May 7, 1822, c. 90, 3 Stat. 688; March
30, 1868, c. 36, 15 Stat. 54; June 8, 1872, c. 335, §§ 21-25, 17 Stat. 283,
287-288. In 1894 there was a general revision of the statutes dealing
with the accounting officers. Act of July 31, 1894, c. 174, 28 Stat.
162, 205-211. The powers and duties there outlined were in the main
those transferred to the General Accounting Office by the Act of 1921.
The question of the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General is
not a question as to bookkeeping merely. The decision of the

arising out of contracts made by a Government-owned
corporation "representing the United States." But here
it must be construed in the light of the statutes dealing
specifically with the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation, of the latter's origin and character and of the
administrative practice prevailing with regard to it and
other similar corporations.
The Fleet Corporation was organized on April 16,
1917-ten days after the United States declared war.- All
of its stock was subscribed and paid for by the Shipping
Board on behalf of the United States. And all the stock
has been held by it since. The company was formed by
the Shipping Board pursuant to the specific authority to
form one or more corporations, which was conferred by
the original Shipping Board Act, September 7, 1916, c. 451,
§ 11, 39 Stat. 728, 731. Congress conferred this authority
in contemplation of the possibility of war, and it required
that any such corporation should be dissolved " at the
expiration of five years from the conclusion of the present
European War." The Fleet Corporation is thus an instrumentality of the Government. See United States v.
Walter, 263 U. S.15, 18. But it was organized under the
general laws of the District of Columbia, as a private corporation, with power to purchase, construct and operate
merchant vessels. The Act authorized the Board " to sell
with the approval of the President, any or all of the stock
of the United States in such corporation, but at no time
Comptroller General upon the allowance of accounts within his
jurisdiction is conclusive upon the executive branch of the Government. Act of July 31, 1894, c. 174, § 8, 28 Stat. 162, 207, following
the provisions of the earlier Act of March 30, 1868, c. 36, 15 Stat. 54.
Save in cases where resort is had to the courts, therefore, the Comptroller is the final arbiter as to the legality of expenditures. See
Annual Report of the General Accounting Office, 1924, p. 3. See
St. Louis, Brownsville & M. Ry. Co. v. United States, 268 U. S. 169,

Government-owned private corporations were employed
by the United States as its instrumentalities in several
other fields during the World War. The Food Administration Grain Corporation (later called the United States
Grain Corporation) was organized under the laws of Delaware under the Food Control Act, August 10, 1917, c. 53,
§ 19, 40 Stat. 276. See Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125, 40
Stat. 1348, and Executive Orders, August 14, 1917, March
4, 1919. The United States Spruce Corporation was organized by the Director of Air Craft Production under
the laws of the District of Columbia, pursuant to the Act
of July'9, 1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 845, 888-889, for the purpose of aiding in the production of aircraft material. The
United States Housing Corporation was organized under
the laws of the District of Columbia by authority of the
President, for the purpose of providing housing for war
needs under the Act of June 4, 1918, c. 92, 40 Stat. 594,
595. The War Finance Corporation was organized under
the Act of April 5, 1918, c. 45, 40 Stat. 506, to assist financially, industries important to the successful prosecution
of the War. For many years before the War, the Government had employed the Panama Railroad Company as its
instrumentality in connection with the Canal.' And, since

the War, the Inland Waterways Corporation has been
organized by the Secretary of War to operate the Government-owned inland waterways system pursuant to the Act
of June 3, 1924, c. 243, 43 Stat. 360. The Government
likewise has established, and holds all the stock in the
Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, formed under the Act
of March 4, 1923, c. 252, § 205, 42 Stat. 1454, 1457, to
bring about easier agricultural credits.'
At no time, during the War, or since its close, have the
financial transactions of the Fleet Corporation passed
through the hands of the general accounting officers of
the Government or been passed upon, as accounts of the
United States, either by the Comptroller of the Treasury
or the Comptroller General.5 The accounts of the Fleet
Corporation, like those of each of the other corporations
named, and like those of the Director General of Railroads during Federal Control,6 have been audited, and the
control over their financial transactions has been exercised, in accordance with commercial practice, by the
board or the officer charged with the responsibilities -f

Land Banks, when they were first created urider the Act of July 17,

administration.' Indeed, an important if not the chief
reason for employing these incorporated agencies was to
enable them to employ commercial methods and to conduct their operations with a freedom supposed to be inconsistent with accountability to the Treasury under its
established procedure of audit and control over the
financial transactions of the United States.8 It is true
that a kind of audit of the Fleet Corporation's transactions was later made by the general accounting officers
pursuant to special legislation, said to have been enacted
at the request of the Shipping Board. But there is no
contention that these statutes, or the audit made thereunder, affect in any way the question here presented,'
save that they may show Congressional approval of the
practice theretofore prevailing. It may be that the other
corporations above-mentioned expended no moneys
7 The accounts of the Housing Corporation were handled by the
Comptroller of the Treasury and his successors after the passage of
the Act of July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35, 55-56, providing that the
funds of the Corporation be covered into the Treasury.
8 See e. g. Annual Report of Inland Waterways Corporation, 1925,
pp. 2-3.
' The Appropriation Act of July 1, 1918, c. 113, 40 Stat. 634, 651,
directed the Secretary of the Treasury "to cause an audit to be made
of the financial transactions of the United States Shipping Board
Emergency Fleet Corporation, under such rules and regulations as he
shall prescribe "; the Appropriation Act of March 20, 1922, c. 104,
42 Stat. 437, 444, directed the Comptroller General to make such
audit, commencing July 1, 1921, "in accordance with the usual
methods of steamship or corporation accounting and under such rules
and regulations as he shall prescribe." These special audits were of
a nature to afford some information concerning past transactions.
But the Acts did not vest control over expenditures either in the Secretary of the Treasury or in the General Accounting Officer making
the audit; and none was asserted. The nature, occasion and purpose
of these special audits is set forth in the Annual Reports of the
Comptroller of the Treasury, 1919, pp. 23-26; 1920, pp. 24-41; and in
the Annual Reports of the General Accounting Office, 1923, p. 34;

appropriated by Congress save those received from the
sale of stock to the Government, whereas the Fleet Corporation had the benefit of money appropriated to the
Shipping Board and by it turned over to the Corpora,
tion.10 The first statute making such an appropriation,
however, provided in terms that the moneys were to be
expended "as other moneys of said corporation are now
expended." Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183.
The transactions of the Fleet Corporation arose out of
the exercise of powers conferred upon it in several different ways. It was urged in the argument that the question of the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General would
depend upon the source of the power giving rise to the
transactions under consideration, because of certain
special statutory provisions as to compensation for claimants, now to be considered. Besides powers conferred
by the general incorporation laws of the District of
Columbia, the Fleet Corporation was vested, by delegation from the President," with the powers conferred upon
him by Acts of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182; April
22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535; and November 4, 1918, c.

the Acts of October 6, 1917, c. 79, 40 Stat. 345; July 1, 1918, c. 113,
40 Stat. 634, 650; June 5, 1920, c. 235, 41 Stat. 874, 891; March 4,

201, 40 Stat. 1020, 1022. Among them were the power
to construct vessels and the power to modify, suspend,
cancel or requisition existing or future contracts for the
construction of vessels. The Act of June 15, 1917 provided also that when the United States should cancel or
requisition any contract, it should make just compensation to be determined by the President; and that, if the
persons concerned were dissatisfied with that determination, 75 per cent. of the amount so determined was to be
paid; and that suit for the additional amount claimed
might be brought against the United States, in the manner provided in § 24 (20) and § 145 of the Judicial Code.
The Merchant Marine Act 1920, June 5, 1920; c. 250,
§ 2, 41 Stat. 988, repealed the provisions of the Acts of
1917 and 1918 above referred to; but it preserved all
rights and remedies accruing as a result of any action
taken under the provisions repealed; provided by § 2 (b)
for their enforcement as though the Act had not been
passed, except that, as provided in § 2 (c), the Shipping
Board should as soon as practicable "adjust, settle, and
liquidate all matters arising out of or incident to the
exercise by or through te President of any of the powers
or duties conferred or imposed upon the President by any
such Act or parts of Acts; and for this purpose the board,
instead of the President, shall have and exercise any
such powers and duties relating to the determination and
payment of just compensation: Provided, That any person dissatisfied with any decision of the board shall have
the same right to sue the United States as he would have
had if the decision had been made by the President of
the United States under the Acts hereby repealed."
The claims of Skinner & Eddy were mainly for the cancellation by the Fleet Corporation of contracts for the
construction of vessels. The Government contends that
the contract giving birth to the claims arose out of or
was incident to the exercise by or through the President

SKINNER & EDDY CORP. v. McCARL.

Opinion of the Court.

of the powers conferred upon him by the statutes referred
to in § 2 (c) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and,
hence, that the Shipping Board, and not the Comptroller
General, has the power and duty to settle and adjust
them and thus to allow or disallow any claims by way of
credits or set-offs arising out of the contracts. Skinner &
Eddy urge that their contracts were made by virtue of
the power conferred upon the Fleet Corporation by the
Shipping Act of 1916; that a controversy arising out of
such contracts is not within § 2 (c) of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1920; and that, hence, the Comptroller General had jurisdiction over its claims. We have no occasion
to determine whether the contracts here in question were
made under the original charter power of the Fleet Corporation or under the additional powers acquired by delegation from the President. Even if § 2 (c) has no application, because the contracts were not entered into pursuant to the power delegated by the President in 1917,
it does not follow that the claims fall within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller General. For the Fleet Corporation is an entity distinct from the United States and from
any of its departments or boards; and the audit and control of its financial transactions is, under the general
rules of law and the administrative practice, committed
to its own corporate officers except so far as control may
be exerted by the Shipping Board. If, on the other hand,
the contracts were made and cancelled by the Fleet Corporation under the power delegated by the President, the
settlement and adjustment of the claim falls clearly
within the powers conferred by § 2 (c) upon the Shipping
Board.
There is nothing in the language of the statutes, or in
reason, to support the suggestion that the Shipping Board
has the power to adjust claims, but that the adjustment
does not become operative unless there is approval of the
final settlement by the Comptroller General. Nor is

275 U. S.

there any basis for the further suggestion of Skinner &
Eddy that the Shipping Board has power to make settlement, if it can; but where a settlement is not made and a
suit by the United States is brought or threatened, the
Comptroller General is the official to whom m'ust be presented all claims for credit in such suit. It is true that the
Merchant Marine Act did not modify § 951 of the
Revised Statutes or impair the right of a defendant to a
credit if sued by the United States upon a Fleet Corporation contract. Since the passage of the Merchant Marine
Act, as before, the defendant may set up the credit, if he
can show disallowance by the appropriate accounting
officers. But § 951 does not prescribe who the appropriate officer is or that the claim must be presented to a
general accounting officer of the Government. As was
held in United States v. Kimball, 101 U. S. 726, the
requirement of the section is satisfied when the claim is
presented and disallowed by the officer who has power to
allow the claim, although he is not a general accounting
officer of the Government.
The Court of Appeals of the District based its judgment of affirmance solely upon the ground that, since
the claims involved were already in the course of litigation in two suits in another federal court, no other court
of co6rdinate jurisdiction could interfere. The Comptroller General had originally taken a somewhat similar
ground for declining to act. But later he stated, in the
trial court, that his answer should be taken as broadly
denying his jurisdiction to consider claims of this nature.
And, in this Court, he specifically disclaimed reliance
upon the ground taken by the Court of Appeals. We
have no occasion to consider its validity. Nor need we
consider whether the refusal of the Comptroller General
to take jurisdiction was a disallowance of the claim within
the meaning of § 951 or any of the other questions which
have been argued concerning the application of that
section.
