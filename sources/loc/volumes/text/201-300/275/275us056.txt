CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

Nos. 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216. Argued October 5, 1927.-Decided
October 24, 1927.

1. To "maintain" a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from
collapse a suit already begun. P. 61.
2. There is no vested right to an injunction against illegal taxes, and
bringing a bill does not create one. P. 61.
3. In the Act of March 4, 1927, amending the Act to provide a civil
government for Porto Rico, the provision that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed
by the laws of Porto Rico shall be maintained in the District Court
of the United States for Porto Rico, applies to suits which were
decided in the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals before
the date of the Act and afterwards brought here by certiorari, and
makes necessary that the decrees, which dismissed the bills on the
merits, be reversed with directions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. P. 61.
4. A court which has been deprived by statute of jurisdiction over a
pending suit to enjoin a tax has no jurisdiction to dispose of money
deposited in the registry by the plaintiff to secure the tax except
to return it to the depositor. P. 62.
16 F. (2d) 545, reversed.

Mr. Francis G. Caffey for petitioners in Nos. 211, 212
and 213.
The Act of March 4, 1927, did not affect cases pending
at the time of its passage. The language does not apply
to suits brought before that date. Gallardo v. Porto Rico
Ry., 18 F. (2d) 918; Moon v. Durden, 2 Exch. 22; Knight
v. Lee, [1893] 1 Q. B. 41; Burbank v. Auburn, 31 Me. 590;

There is a presumption that a statute does not apply to a
case pending at the time of its enactment. McEwen v.
Den, 24 How. 242; Twenty Per Cent. Cases, 20 Wall. 179;
Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U. S. 529; Lewellyn v. Frick, 268

To justify construing the language of a statute as retroactive in effect, its language must be" imperative," United
States v. Heth, 3 Cr. 413; Auffm'ordt v. Rasin, 102 U. S.
622; U. S. Fidelity Co. v. Struthers Co., 209 U. S. 314;

sary," Harvey v. Tyler, 2 Wall. 347; and "manifest,"
Shreveport v. Cole, 129 U. S. 43. See especially, Twenty
Per Cent. Cases, 20 Wall. 179; United States v. St. Louis
&c. Ry., 270 U. S.1; White v. United States, 270 U. S. 175.
There is nothing in the general situation, or in the
apparent purpose, or in the language, to indicate an intention by Congress to apply it to cases brought before the
date of its enactment. Nor was anything said in Congress,
during the consideration of the bill revealing an expectation that such cases would be swept away. Cong. Rec.,
69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5052.
The word "maintain" is at least of ambiguous import.
As applied to legal actions it may mean support, hold,
continue, commence, institute, or begin. Boutiller v. Milwaukee, 8 Minn. 97; Smith v. Lyon, 44 Conn. 175; Nat.
M. Co. v. Dist. Ct., 34 Nev. 67.
If it were now held that the Act of March 4, 1927, destroyed the jurisdiction of the District Court for Porto
Rico to entertain the present cases and they were abated
or dismissed, so far as concerns the accumulated sums in
court the taxpayers would, or might, be wholly remediless,
even though the tax statutes were later found to be invalid. If citizens were left without remedy in that way,
it would deprive them of due process of law. De Lima v.
Bidwell, 182 U. S. 199. Support of the same view is expressed in Memphis v. United States, 97 U. S. 293;
Pritchardv. Norton, 106 U. S.124; Louisiana v. Mayor,
109 U. S.285; Ettor v. Tacoma, 228 U. S. 148; Ochoa v.
Hernandez, 230 U. S. 139; Truax v. Corrigan,257 U. S.
312. Avoidance of such a consequence, or the existence
even of doubt about it, is an additional reason for construing the statute so as not to interfere with pending
cases. Carey v. South Dakota,.250 U. S.118; Lewellyn v.
Frick, 268 U. S.238.
If the Act of March 4, 1927, had been in effect when the
suits were commenced, it would not have deprived the

District Court for Porto Rico of power .to grant the relief
sought.
Mr. Carroll G. Walter for petitioners in Nos. 214, 215
and 216.
The new statute is inapplicable to pending cases. Gal-.
lardo v. Porto Rico Ry., 18 F. (2d) 918; Grasso v. Holbrook, 102 App. Div. 49; Moon v. Durden, 2 Exch. 22;
Knight v. Lee, [1893] 1 Q. B. 41; Burbank v. Auburn, 31
Me. 590; Smith v. Lyon, 44 Conn. 175; Creditors Co. v.
Rossi, 26 Cal. App. 725; United States v. St. Louis Ry.,
270 U. S. 1; Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205; Fullerton
Co. v. Nor. Pac. Ry., 266 U. S. 435; U. S. Fidelity Co. v.
Struthers Co., 209 U. S. 306; Twenty Per Cent. Cases, 20
Wall. 179. Rev. Stats. § 13.
It certainly does not affect cases already determined in
the District Court, or affect the jurisdiction of this Court
to review decrees previously made by the Circuit Court of
Appeals.
The perfecting of the appeal transfers the case from the
trial court to the appellate court. Keyser v. Farr, 105
U. S. 265; Morrin v. Lawler, 91 Fed. 693. Consequently,
the prosecution of an appeal or writ of certiorari cannot
be regarded as the maintenance of a suit in the trial court.
Neither appeals nor writs of error ordinarily are regarded
as within the purview of statutes affecting "actions" or
"suits." 3 C. J. 305, 330. Neither does such a statute
.prohibit the District Court from giving effect to a judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals or of this
Court. White v. United States, 270 U. S. 175.
The cases come within the doctrine of Hill v. Wal.lace, 259 U. S. 44. If Rev. Stats. § 3224 would not
prevent the maintenance of these suits if the taxes involved were imposed by the United States, then the Act
of March 4, 1927, does not prevent their maintenance even
if construed as applicable to pending cases. To construe
the Act as depriving petitioners of the right to relief in

these cases would render it unconstitutional and void,
because as so construed the statute would deprive them
of all remedy.
A case is said to become moot when subsequent events
destroy the actuality of the controversy, and make a
'decision of the questions presented unnecessary to a determination of the rights of the parties. United States v.
Hamburg Co., 239 U. S. 466; Berry v. Davis, 242 U. S.
468; Pub. Util. Commrs. v. CompaniaGen., 249 U. S. 425.
The actuality of the present controversy certainly is not
destroyed by the Act of March 4, 1927. Whether or not
petitioners must pay the taxes imposed by the tax statute
of August 20, 1925, and whether they may be fined and
imprisoned and their property seized if they make sales
without paying such taxes, is still a live controversy, not
in any way affected by the Act of March 4th, and a
decision of the questions presented is still necessary to a
determination of their rights. Whether or not they are
entitled to a return of their money, now in the custody
and under the control of the District Court, is far from
being a moot or academic question. It presents a controversy of "present actuality."
Mr. William Cattron Rigby, with whom Mr. George C.
Butte, Attorney General of Porto Rico, was on the brief,
for respondent.
Mr. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.
These are suits brought in the District Court of the
United States for Porto Rico to restrain the collection of
taxes imposed by the laws of Porto Rico. On January 7,
1927, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed decrees of the
District Court dismissing the bills. On March 4, 1927, by
c. 503, § 7, of the Act of that year, Congress provided that
§ 48 of the Act to provide a civil government for Porto
Rico should be amended to read as follows: "Sec. 48.
That the Supreme and District Courts of Porto Rico and
the respective judges thereof may grant writs of habeas

Opinion of the Court.

corpus in all cases in which the same are grantable by the
judges of the District Courts of the United States, and the
District Courts may grant writs of mandamus in all proper
cases.
"That no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Porto
Rico shall be maintained in the District Court of the
United States for Porto Rico." 44 Stats. 1418, 1421.
Writs of certiorari were granted by this Court on May
16, 1927, but argument was ordered on the question
whether the cases had not become moot by virtue of
that Act.
Apart from a natural inclination to read them more
narrowly, there would seem to be no doubt that the words
of the statute covered these cases. To maintain a suit is
to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suit
already begun. And although the Circuit Court of
Appeals in Gallardov. PortoRico Ry.; Light & Power Co.,
18 F. (2d) 918, 923, with some color of authority has
held that the Act does not apply, we cannot accept that
view. To apply the statute to present suits is not to give
it retrospective effect but to take it literally and to carry
out the policy that it embodies of preventing the Island
from having its revenues held up by injunction; a policy
no less applicable to these suits than to those begun at a
later day, and a general policy of our law. Rev. Stat. §
3224. So interpreted the Act as little interferes with existing rights of the petitioners as it does with those of future
litigants. There is no vested right to an injunction against
collecting illegal taxes and bringing these bills did not
create one. Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S. 506, 509.
This statute is not like a provision that no action shall be
brought upon a contract previously valid, which in substance would take away a vested right if held to govern
contracts then in force. It does not even attempt to
validate previously unlawful taxes. It simply makes it
plain that these cases are not excepted from the well

Syllabus.

275 U. S.

known general rule against injunctions. It does not leave
the taxpayer without power to resist an unlawful tax,
whatever-the difficulties in the way of resisting it.
The sequence of the clause in the amendment after
others giving authority to grant writs of habeas corpus
and mandamus shows that it puts a limit to the power of
the Court. See Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U. S. 118, 119.
That is a question of construction and common sense.
Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U. S. 230, 235. Therefore when
the District Court required a deposit in the registry of a
sum to secure payment of the tax in dispute, the money
should be returned as there is no jurisdiction to dispose
of it otherwise.
Of course it does not matter that these cases had gone
to a higher Court. When the root is cut the branches fall.
McNulty v. Batty, 10 How. 72.
As the bills were dismissed upon the merits (with partial injunctions in Valdes v. Gallardo and Finlay, Waymouth & Lee, Inc. v. Gallardo) the decrees should be
reversed and the cases sent back with directions to dismiss
for want of jurisdiction.
Decrees reversed and bills ordered to be dismissed.
Money deposited in Court for payment of
taxes in case of adverse decision to be returned.
GALLARDO v. SANTINI FERTILIZER COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
PORTO RICO, TRANSFERRED FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT UNDER THE ACT OF SEPTEMBER 14, 1922.

No. 164.

Argued October 5, 1927.-Decided October 24, 1927.

1. In a case transferred here by the Circuit Court of Appeals in which
this Court finds that the trial court lacked jurisdiction, direction for
dismissal of the suit on that ground is made -without determining

whether the transfer was erroneous. P. 63.
