pute is the middle of the channel of the Rio Grande as it
was located in 1850, extending southwardly from the parallel of 32 degrees north latitude to the parallel of 31
degrees 47 minutes, as found and described by the master
in Section V (1) of his report; thie intersection of the
east bank of the river with the line of the 32nd parallel
to be taken at a point 600 feet west from the Clark Monument No. 1 as re-established by the Scott-Cockrell Commission, and the middle line of the channel to be taken 150
feet from the east and west banks of the river, respectively,
as found by the master.
It results that the bill of New Mexico must be dismissed; and that, under the cross-bill of Texas, the line
above described must be decreed to be the boundary between the two States.
This boundary line should now be accurately surveyed
and marked by a commissioner or commissioners to be appointed by the Court, whose report shall be subject to its
approval.
The parties may submit within forty days the form of a
decree to carry these conclusions into effect.
Bill dismissed and decree directed under crossbill.

No. 102.

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

Argued December 1, 1927.-Decided December 12, 1927.

The owners of a vessel, remaining in their possession while timechartered to the plaintiffs, docked her with the defendant under a
provision of the charter for docking every six months and suspension of payment of hire by the plaintiffs until she was again ready
for service. Defendant injured the vessel by negligence, causing
delay, repaired her, settled with the owners and received a release
of all their claims. Defendant had no notice of the charter until

the delay had begun. Held, that plaintiffs had no cause of action
against the defendant for the loss of use of the vessel caused by
the negligence, since,
(1) The docking contract between the owners and defendant was not
for the plaintiffs' direct benefit. P. 307.
(2) No right of recovery could be based upon the ground that plaintiffs had a property interest in or right in rem against the ship.

P. 308.
(3) A tort to the person or property of one man does not make the
tortfeasor liable to another merely because the injured person was
under a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the
wrong. P. 309.
(4) Plaintiffs, having no claim against the defendant in contract or
in tort, could gain no standing on the theory that the owners, in
addition to their own damages, might have recovered those of the
plaintiffs, on the analogy of bailees, who, if allowed to recover full
value, are chargeable over. P. 310.

The petitioner was not unconditionally liable to the
shipowners for the full market value of the vessel's use
for fourteen days. As a contractor, the petitioner was
answerable to the shipowners for the ensuing detention,
only if such detention was reasonably to be apprehended
as a probable result of the petitioner's breaking the propeller, at the time when the petitioner contracted to install it. Hadley v. Baxendale, 26 Eng. L. & Eq. 398;

Even assuming that the shipowners might have recovered from the petitioner an amount equal to the full market value of the vessel's use during the entire period of
detention, and that the petitioner, through its participation in the settlement with the shipowners, rendered itself liable as a tortfeasor to the charterers, it seems clear
that such liability to the charterers would not be enforceable in admiralty. The Eclipse, 135 U. S. 599; Kellum v.

By making payment to the owner the petitioner recognized its liability at least to the extent of the owner's
share in the market value of the use (limited by the
charter).
Recovery of loss from the owner was not successful,
liability being denied on the ground that the owner performed its full duty under the charter by selecting a
repair yard of good repute. The Biornefjord, 271 Fed.

The relation of the respondents was such as to support
a recovery of damages based on their loss of use during
the period of detention caused by the petitioner's
negligence.
The contract for use of a vessel is property, just as is a
contract for construction. Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. U. S.,

The time-charterer's operations as receiver of cargo can
also subject the ship to liens. The Capitaine Faure, 10

The relation was such as to make them the carriers of
such cargoes as should be loaded on the vessel. The

Beaver, 219 Fed. 134; Hines v. SangstadS. S. Co., 266 Fed.

Recovery is proper on the ground that the respondents
were beneficiaries of the shipowner's contract with the
petitioner for dry docking and repairing the steamer.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a libel by time charterers of the steamship
Bjornefjord against the Dry Dock Company to recover
for the loss of use of the steamer between August 1 and
August 15, 1917. The libellants recovered in both Courts
below. 13 Fed. (2d) 3. A writ of certiorari was granted
by this Court. 273 U. S. 679.
By the terms of the charter party the steamer was to be
docked at least once in every six months, and payment of
the hire was to be suspended until she was again in proper
state for service. In accordance with these terms the
vessel was delivered to the petitioner and docked, and
while there the propeller was so injured by the petitioner's
negligence that a new one had to be put in, thus causing
the delay for which this suit is brought. The petitioner
seems to have had no notice of the charter party until the
delay had begun, but on August 10, 1917, was formally
advised by the respondents that they should hold it liable.
It settled with the owners on December 7. 1917, and
received a release of all their claims.
The present libel "in a cause of contract and damage"
seems to have been brought in reliance upon an allegation that the contract for dry docking between the petitioner and the owners "was made for the benefit of the
libellants and was incidental to the aforesaid charter
party" &c. But it is plain, as stated by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, that the libellants, respondents here, were not
parties to that contract "or in any respect beneficiaries"
and were not entitled to sue for a breach of it " even under
the most liberal rules that permit third parties to sue on
a contract made for their benefit." 13 F. (2d) 4. " Before
a stranger can avail himself of the exceptional privilege
of suing for a breach of an agreement, to which he is not
a party, he must, at least show that it was intended for
his direct benefit." German Alliance Insurance Co. v.

Opinion of the Court.

275 U.S.

Home Water Supply Co., 226 U. S. 220, 230. Although
the respondents still somewhat faintly argue the contrary,
this question seems to us to need no more words. But as
the case has been discussed here and below without much
regard to the pleadings we proceed to consider the other
grounds upon which it has been thought that a recovery
could be maintained.
The District Court allowed recovery on the ground that
the respondents had a "property right " in the vessel, although it is not argued that there was a demise, and the
owners remained in possession. This notion also is repudiated by the Circuit Court of Appeals and rightly. The
question is whether the respondents have an interest protected by the law against unintended injuries inflicted
upon the vessel by third persons who know nothing of the
charter. If they have, it must be worked out through
their contract relations with the owners, not on the postulate that they have a right in rem against the ship.
Leary v. UnitedStates, 14 Wall. 607. New Orleans-Belize
Royal Mail & Central American Steamship Co. v. United
States, 239 U. S. 202.
Of course the contract of the petitioner with the owners
imposed no immediate obligation upon the petitioner to
third persons, as we already have said, and whether the
petitioner performed it promptly or with negligent delay
was the business of the owners and of nobody else. But
as there was a tortious damage to a chattel it is sought to
connect the claim of the respondents with that in some
way. The damage was material to them only as it caused
the delay in making the repairs, and that delay would be
a wrong to no one except for the petitioner's contract with
the owners. The injury to the propeller was no wrong to
the respondents but only to those to whom it belonged.
But suppose that the respondent's loss flowed directly
from that source. Their loss arose only through their
contract with the owners-and while intentionally to

bring about a breach of contract may give rise to a cause
of action, Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &
Omaha Ry. Co., 151 U. S. 1, no authority need be cited to
show that, as a general rule, at least, a tort to the person
or property of one man does not make the tortfeasor liable
to another merely because the injured person was under
a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the
wrong. See Savings Bank v. Ward, 100 U. S. 195. The
law does not spread its protection so far. A good statement, applicable here, will be found in Elliott Steam Tug
Co., Ltd. v. The Shipping Controller, [1922] 1 K. B. 127,
139, 140. Byrd v. English, 117 Ga. 192. The Federal No.
2, 21 F. (2d) 313.
The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals seems to
have been influenced by the consideration that if the
whole loss occasioned by keeping a vessel out of use were
recovered and divided a part would go to the respondents.
It seems to have been thought that perhaps the whole
might have been recovered by the owners, that in thai
event the owners would have been trustees for the respondents to the extent of the respondents' share, and
that no injustice would be done to allow the respondents
to recover their share by direct suit. But justice does not
permit that the petitioner be charged with the full value
of the loss of use unless there is some one who has a
claim to it as against the petitioner. The respondents
have no claim either in contract or in tort, and they cannot get a standing by the suggestion that if some one else
had recovered it he would have been bound to pay over
a part by reason of his personal relations with the respondents. The whole notion of such a recovery is based
on the supposed analogy of bailees who if allowed to
recover the whole are chargeable over, on what has been
thought to be a misunderstanding of the old law that the
bailees alone could sue for a conversion and were answerable over for the chattel to their bailor. Whether this
view be historically correct or not there is no analogy to

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 226.

Argued October 12, 13, 1927.-Decided December 12, 1927.

1. The term "any officer of the law" in ยง 26, Title II of the National Prohibition Act, refers only to federal officers. P. 313.
2. If it appears from the evidence or from facts of which the Court
will take judicial notice, that, in making a search and seizure, state
officers were acting solely on behalf of the United States, evidence
thus obtained is inadmissible in a prosecution in a federal court if
the circumstances of the search and seizure were such as to render
it unlawful. P. 314.
3. Defendants were arrested by New York State troopers, their automobile (while occupied by one of them and therefore within the
protection accorded to his person) was searched without a warrant,
intoxicating liquor found therein was seized, and defendants and
liquor were immediately turned over to federal authorities for
prosecution under the National Prohibition Act. The troopers
acted without probable cause, and made the arrest, search and seizure solely on behalf of the United States. Held, that the admission
in evidence of the liquor in such prosecution violated the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments. P. 316.
4. A conviction in a federal court resting wholly upon evidence obtained through a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights
may be reversed although the point was not properly presented in
the courts below. P. 319.
16 F. (2d) 1016, reversed.
