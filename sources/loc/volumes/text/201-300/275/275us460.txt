Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

MELLON, DIRECTOR GENERAL, v. ARKANSAS
LAND & LUMBER CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 73.

Argued October 27, 1927.-Decided January 3, 1928.

Under § 206 of the Transportation Act, 1920, which provided that
actions at law based on causes of action arising out of the operation by the President of the railroad of any carrier, might, after
the termination of federal control, be brought against "an agent
designated by the President for such purpose . . . within the
periods of limitation now prescribed by State or Federal statutes,"
an action was mistakenly brought against one who had resigned
from the position of designated agent. Held, that the substitution
of his successor was in effect the commencement of a new and
independent proceeding, which was barred by the running of the
applicable state statute of limitations before the substitution was
made. P. 462.

CERTIORARI, 273 U. S. 676, to a judgment of the Supreme
Court of Arkansas, sustaining a recovery in an action
brought by the Land and Lumber Company under the
Transportation Act.
Mr. J. Q. Mahaffey for petitioner.
Mr. E. F. McFaddin for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question in this case relates to the construction and
effect of the provision in § 206 of the Transportation Act,
1920,' which permitted suits on causes of action that had
arisen during the Federal control of railroads to be
brought thereafter against an Agent designated by the
President. This section, in so far as here material, pro1 41 Stat. 456, c. 91.

Opinion of the Court.

vided that actions at law based on causes of action arising
out of the operation by the President of the railroad of
any carrier, might, after the termination of Federal control, be brought against "an agent designated by the
within the periods of
President for such purpose
limitation now prescribed by State or Federal statutes ";
and that a judgment "rendered against the agent designated by the President " should be paid out of a revolving
fund created by the Act.
On July 23, 1918, a cause of action accrued in favor of
the Arkansas Land & Lumber Company on account of the
misdelivery of a carload of lumber shipped by it over the
railroads of two carriers then being operated under Federal control. The Arkansas statute of limitations provided that suit "shall be commenced within three years
after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after." '2
No suit was brought during the period of Federal control, which terminated on March 1, 1920.' Thereafter, on
July 9, 1921-nearly three years after the cause of action
accrued-the Company brought suit in an Arkansas circuit court against "John Barton Payne, Director General, as Agent for" the railroad carriers, alleging that he
then was " the agent duly designated by the President"
against whom suits might be brought.' At that time
Payne was not the Agent designated by the President,
having resigned as Director General and designated Agent
more than three months before; and James C. Davis had
been designated by the President and then was the Agent. 5

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

In October, 1921-more than three years after the cause
of action accrued--on a plea in abatement by Payne to
the effect that he was not the designated Agent, the court
dismissed the suit as to him; and, on motion of the plaintiff, Davis, the designated Agent, was substituted as the
defendant. Davis, thereafter appearing, pleaded that
under § 206 of the Transportation Act the suit could not
be prosecuted against him as he had not been made a
party within the period of limitation prescribed by the
Arkansas statute. The circuit court sustained this plea
and dismissed the suit. The Supreme Court reversed the
judgment on the ground that the substitution of Davis
was not the institution of a new action against him, but
merely an amendment correcting the name of the defendant in furtherance of justice; and remanded the cause
to the circuit court. 155 Ark. 541. Davis there renewed
his plea under the Transportation Act. This was overruled, and judgment was rendered against him. The
Supreme Court-in which the petitioner, who meanwhile
had succeeded Davis as the designated Agent,6 was substituted as the appellant-adhered to its former ruling
and affirmed the judgment. 170 Ark. 552.
This, we find, was error. The United States had not
consented to being sued after the termination of Federal
control except as provided by § 206 of the Transportation
Act, that is, by a suit brought against the Agent designated by the President for such purpose, within the
period of limitation prescribed by the State statute. This
plainly meant that the suit must be brought within the
period of limitation against the person who was the designated Agent and alone had authority to represent the
Government. The bringing of the suit against Payne,
who was not the designated Agent, was not a compliance
with this requirement and brought no representative of
Proclamation, 44 Stat. 2598.

Syllabus.

the Government before the court. Davidson v. Payne
(C. C. A.) 289 Fed. 69. The substitution of Davis, the
designated Agent, was not the correction of an error in
the name of the .defendant, but the bringing in of a
different defendant, and was in effect the commencement
of a new and independent proceeding against him to
enforce the liability of the Government. See Davis v.
Cohen Co., 268 U. S. 638, 642; Mellon v. Weiss, 270 U. S.
565, 567. And, as this substitution, being made more
than three years after the cause of action had accrued,
was not a compliance with the requirement of the Transportation Act that the action be brought against the designated Agent within the period of limitation prescribed
by the State statute, the plea should have been sustained
and the suit dismissed.
This conclusion is substantially the same as that in
United States v. Davis (D. C. App.) 8 F. (2d) 907;
Vassau v. Northern Pacific Railway, 69 Mont. 305; Davis
v. Griffith, 103 Okla. 137; and Natoli v. Davis, 75 Cal.
App. 309: contra, Bailey v. Hines, 131 Va. 421.
The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to
the Supreme Court of Arkansas for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 103.

Argued December 1, 1927.-Decided January 3, 1928.

1. Section 10 of the Dingley Act of 1884, as amended by the Seamen's
Act of 1915, and the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, does not apply
either expressly or by implication to advance wages paid by foreigr
vessels to foreign seamen while in ports of foreign countries whose
laws sanction such payments. P. 470.
