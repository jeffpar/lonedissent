Argument for Blodgett.

275 U. S.

BLODGETT v. HOLDEN, COLLECTOR'
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 154.

Argued October 4, 1927.-Decided November 21, 1927.

1. The Revenue Act of 1924, §§ 319-324, in so far as it undertakes
to impose a tax on gifts fully consummated before its provisions
taxing gifts came before Congress, is invalid under the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. McReynolds, J.; Taft, C. J.,
and Van Devanter and Butler, JJ., concurring. P. 147.
2. The provision of the Act in question should be construed, in favor
of constitutionality, as meant to operate only from the date of the
Act, and only to tax gifts thereafter made. Holmes, J.; Brandeis,
Sanford, and Stone, JJ., concurring. P. 149.
RESPONSE to questions certified by the Circuit Court of
Appeals arising upon review by it of a judgment of the
District Court, 11 F. (2d) 180, in favor of. the defendant;
in a suit to recover money exacted of the plaintiff,
Blodgett, by Holden, Collector, as a tax on gifts.

Mr. Mark Norris for Blodgett.
This " gift" tax is an unapportioned " direct" tax and
therefore in contravention of Art. I, cl. 3, § 2, and cl. 4,
§ 9 of the Constitution.
The tax, so far as it affects the plaintiff in this case, has
deprived him of property without compensation and without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment.

Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr.
Robert P. Reeder, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, were on the brief, for Holden, Collector.
The tax upon transfers of property by gift is not a
direct tax but an excise tax. It is not unconstitutional
as applied to transfers of property by gift during the
earlier portion of the year in which the law was passed.
It is clearly established that retroactive legislation is
not unconstitutional as such. The Constitution forbids
Congress to enact ex post facto laws and it forbids the
States to enact ex post facto laws and laws impairing the
obligation of contracts, but with these express exceptions
neither federal nor state legislation is unconstitutional
because it is retroactive. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386;
The Peggy, 1 Cr. 103; Prize Cases, 2 Black. 635; Johannessen v. United States, 225 U. S. 227; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380; Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68;
Kentucky Union Co. v. Kentucky, 219 U. S. 140. This
Court has sustained state tax laws which were retroactive
in scope, Carpenterv. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456; Locke
v. New Orleans, 4 Wall. 172; Seattle v. Kelleher, 195 U. S.
351; State v. Bell, 61 N. C. 76; and it has sustained similar federal taxes, Stockdale v. Ins. Cos., 20 Wall. 323;
Railroad Co. v. Rose, 95 U. S. 78; Billings v. United
States, 232 U. S. 261.
The certificate from the- Circuit Court of Appeals
states that the gifts under consideration were made between January first and the approval of the law, but it

Opinion of McReynolds, J.

does not say that they were made before February 26,
when the House of Representatives decided that such
gifts should be taxed. For all that appears, the gifts
were not made more than a day before the law was
approved.
The only question which is here necessarily involved is
whether Congress may constitutionally tax a transfer by
gift made while Congress is enacting the tax law, or even
after both Houses of Congress have passed the law and
it is awaiting the action of the President. This case is
not like that of Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531.
A tax upon the transfer by gift of state and municipal
bonds is not a tax upon those bonds and may be imposed
by Congress without unconstitutionally interfering with
the operations of the governments issuing them.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS:

The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has
certified three questions and asked instructions in respect
of them. Title 28, § 346, U. S. C. It is only necessary to
answer the one which follows.
"Are the provisions of Secs. 319-324 of the Revenue
Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 313, unconstitutional insofar
as they impose and levy a tax upon transfers of property
by gifts inter vivos, not made in contemplation of death,
and made prior to June 2, 1924, on which date the Act was
approved, because the same is a direct tax and unapportioned, or because it takes property without due process,

or for public use without just compensation, in violation
of the Fifth Amendment? "
The Revenue Act approved June 2, 1924, provides"Sec. 319. For the calendar year 1924 and each calendar year thereafter, a tax equal to the sum of the following
is hereby imposed upon the transfer by a resident by gift
during such calendar year of any property wherever situated, whether made directly or indirectly, and upon the
transfer by a nonresident by gift during such calendar
year of any property situated within the United States,
whether made directly or indirectly: 1 per centum of the
amount of the taxable gifts not in excess of $50,000;
etc..
"Sec. 320. If the gift is made in property, the fair market value thereof at the date of the gift shall be considered
the amount of the gift. Where property is sold or exchanged for less than a fair consideration in money or
money's worth, then the amount by which the fair market
value of the property exceeded the consideration received
shall, for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 319,
be deemed a gift, and shall be included in computing the
amount of gifts made during the calendar year."
Section 321 allows certain deductions-$50,000; donations for charitable purposes, etc.
Section 322 is unimportant here.
"Sec. 323. Any person who within the year 1924 or any
calendar year thereafter makes any gift or gifts in excess
of the deductions allowed by section 321 shall, on or before
the 15th day of March, file with the collector a return
under oath in duplicate, listing and setting forth therein
all gifts and contributions made by him during such calendar year. . .
"See. 324. The tax imposed by section 319 shall be paid
by the donor on or before the 15th day of March, and shall
be assessed,, collected, and paid in the same manner and

subject, in so far as applicable, to the same provisions of
law as the tax imposed by section 301."
Act of February 26, 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 86, c. 27"Sec. 324. (a) Section 319 of the Revenue Act of 1924
is amended to read as follows:
"' Sec. 319. For the calendar year 1924 and the calendar
year 1925, a tax equal-to the sum of the following is hereby
imposed upon the transfer by a resident by gift during
such calendar year of any property wherever situated,
whether made directly or indirectly, and upon the transfer
by a nonresident by gift during such calendar year of any
property situated within the United States, whether made
directly or indirectly: 1 per centum of the amount of the
taxable gifts not in excess of $50,000; . . .' [Some of
the succeeding percentages are less and some are higher
than those specified by the Act of 1924.]
"(b) Subdivision (a) of this section shall take effect as
of June 2, 1924."
During the calendar year 1924, and prior to June 2,
plaintiff Blodgett, a resident of the United States, transferred by gifts inter vivos, and not in contemplation of
death, property valued at more than $850,000.00; after
June 2 he made other gifts valued at $6,500.00. The collector exacted of him the tax prescribed by the Act of
1924, as amended, on such transfers and this suit seeks
recovery of the sum so paid. The claim is that the taxing
Act, if applicable in the circumstances stated, conflicts
with the Fifth Amendment.
At the argument here counsel for Blodgett affirmed that
all the transfers prior to June 2 were really made during
the month of January; and the accuracy of this statement
was not questioned. Under the circumstances, we will
treat this affirmation as if it were part of the recital of
facts by the court below.
.The brief in behalf of the Collector sets out the legislative history of the gift tax provisions in the Revenue Act

,BLODGETT v. HOLDEN.
142

Opinion of Holmes, J.

of 1924 and shows that they were not presented for the
consideration of Congress prior to February 25 of that
year. We must, therefore, determine whether Congress
had power to impose a charge upon the donor because of
gifts fully consummated before such provisions came
before it.
In Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, this Court pointed
out that a statute purporting to lay a tax may be so arbitrary and capricious that its enforcement would amount
to deprivation of property without due process of law
within the inhibition of the Fifth Amendment. As to
the gifts which Blodgett made during January, 1924, we
think the challenged enactment is arbitrary and for that
reason invalid. It seems wholly unreasonable that one
who, in entire good faith and without the slightest premonition of such consequence, made absolute disposition
of his property by gifts should thereafter be required to
pay a charge for so doing.
Determination of the cause does not require us to consider other objections to the Statute which have been
advanced. And it is unnecessary to express an opinion
concerning the validity of the Statute as to transfers subsequent to June 2. Here, all such gifts were within the
exemption granted.
So far as the Revenue Act of 1924 undertakes to impose
a tax because of the gifts made during January, 1924, it
is arbitrary and invalid under the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment.
The

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES:

Although research has shown and practice has established the futility of the charge that it was a usurpation
when this Court undertook to declare an Act of Congress
unconstitutional, I suppose that we all agree that to do

148

Opinion of Holmes, J.

so is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court
is called on to perform. Upon this among other considertions the rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be
unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is
to adopt that which will save the Act. Even to avoid a
serious doubt the rule is the same. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 407, 408. United
States v. Standard Brewery, 251 U. S. 210, 220. Texas v.
Eastern Texas R. R. Co., 258 U. S. 204, 217. Bratton v.
Chandler,260 U. S. 110, 114. PanamaR. R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 390. Words have been strained more
than they need to be strained here in order to avoid that
doubt. United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394,
401, 402. In a different sphere but embodying the same
general attitude as to construction, see United States v.
Goelet, 232 U. S. 293, 297
By § 319 of the Revenue Act of 1924, (June 2, 1924, c.
234; 43 Stat. 253, 313) a tax is laid on gifts 'For the calendar year 1924 and each calendar year thereafter.' In
the Code the words are 'during any calendar year.' Title
26, § 1131. The latter phrase brings out what I should
think was obvious without its aid, that the purpose is a
general one to indicate the periods to be regarded, as distinguished from fiscal years, not necessarily to run counter
to the usual understanding that statutes direct themselves
to future not to past transactions. Reynolds v. McArthur, 2 Pet. 417, 434. Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U. S. 529, 534.
Lewellyn v. Frick, 268 U. S. 238, 251, 252. If when the
statute was passed it had been well recognized that Congress had no power to tax past gifts I think that we should
have no trouble in reading the Act as meant to operate
only from its date and only to tax gifts thereafter made.
If I am right, we should read it in that way now. By
§ 324 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, (February 26, 1926,
c. 27; 44 Stat. 9, 86,) § 319 of the Act of 1924 is amended

Statement of the Case.

and the rates of taxation are reduced, and then by (b)
it is provided that 'subdivision (a) of this section shall
take effect as of June 2, 1924,' the date when the earlier
act was passed. A reasonable interpretation is that the
reduction and the tax operate alike on gifts after that
date. Taking both statutes into account, and the principles of construction to which I have referred, I think it
tolerably plain that the Act should be read as referring
only to transactions taking place after it was passed, when
to disregard the rule 'would be to impose an unexpected
liability that if known might have induced those concerned to avoid it and to use their money in other ways.'
Lewellyn v. Frick, 268 U. S. 232, 251, 252.
On the general question whether there is power to tax
gifts I express no opinion now. I agree with the result
that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the taxes paid in
respect of gifts made before the statute went into effect.
