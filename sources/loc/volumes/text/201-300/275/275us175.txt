MASON v. ROUTZAHN.
Statement of the Case.

on final hearing are applicable in the main also to this
case. We think that it should be heard by the District
Court anew upon final hearing upon evidence to be adduced. To this end, the decree entered in the Court of
Appeals is affirmed in so far as it reversed the decree dismissing the bill. In so far as it directs that an injunction
issue, it is modified to the extent of directing an injunction
pending the suit instead of a permanent injunction, the
propriety of the latter being reserved until the final hearing. The cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on final hearing, that court to have liberty, among other things, to allow amendment of the
pleadings. Costs in this Court are not allowed to either
party.
Decree modified and cause remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings.

CERTIORARI,

273 U. S. 687, to a judgment of the Cir-

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

Messrs. Horace Andrews and Charles E. Hughes, with
whom Messrs. S. M. Jett and Harrison Tweed were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Solicitor General Mitchell for respondent, was unable
to support the reasoning of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
but he felt constrained to present the case fully in deference to the views of that Court.
Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Edward Cornell, William C.
Breed, Paul Armitage, and Harrison Tweed; and Mr.
James E. MacCloskey, Jr., filed briefs as amici curiae, by
special leave of Court.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Section 31 (b), which was added to the Revenue Act
of 1916 by the Revenue Act of 1917, October 3, 1917,
c. 63, Title XII, 40 Stat. 300, 338, provides that any
"distribution made to the shareholders . . in the year
nineteen hundred and seventeen, or subsequent tax years,
. . shall constitute a part of the annual income of the
distributee for the year in which received," but that it
"shall be deemed to have been made from the most
recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus
and shall be taxed to the distributee at the rates prescribed by law for the years in which such profits were
accumulated." See Edwards v. Douglas, 269 U. S. 204.
Mason, a shareholder in the B. F. Goodrich Company,
received during the year 1917, five dividends prior to
July 3. Two of them had been declared in the year 1916;
three in January, 1917. In his income tax return for
1917, he reported all these dividends as taxable at the
1916 rate, and paid on that basis. The Commissioner of
Internal Revenue determined that the tax on all these
dividends was payable at the 1917 rate, which was higher
than that for 1916; and assessed the additional amount.

MASON v. ROUTZAHN.

Opinion of the Court.

It was paid under protest. Then this suit was brought
against the Collector, in the federal court for northern
Ohio, to recover the amount exacted. The case was heard
without a jury upon stipulated facts, which were adopted
by the court as its findings. The District Court entered
judgment for Mason for the full amount, 8 F. (2d) 56.
Its judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 13 F. (2d) 702. This Court granted a writ of
certiorari, 273 U. S. 687.
The Government admits that no profits were earned in'
1917 prior to the payment of the dividends here in question. Mason claims, as to two of the dividends, that the
1916 rate applied, because the dividends had been declared in that year; and as to all the dividends, that the
1916 rate applied, since the corporation had not earned
in 1917 any net profits prior to the dates of the several
dividend payments, so that the most recently accumulated
net profits were those earned in the year 1916, which were
more than sufficient for this purpose.
The District Court held that, despite the fact that the
profits for 1917 were in excess of all dividends paid in that
year, the distribution must be deemed to have been made
out of profits accumulated in 1916; and entered judgment
for the full amount. Thereafter, and before this case was
heard in the Court of Appeals, Edwards v. Douglas was
decided by this Court. The Court of Appeals recognized
that Edwards v. Douglas differed in its facts from the case
at bar. But it concluded that, under the reasoning of
the opinion in that case, the taxing year should be treated
as a unit; and it believed that it was required to hold
that, if the net profits of a whole year prove sufficient to
meet all the dividends paid within it, these must be
deemed to have been paid from such profits, even if it
affirmatively appears that none had been earned before
the date when the latest dividend was paid.
The Solicitor General concedes that Edwards v. Douglas does not so decide; that the case is authority only for
83583'-28-12

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

the proposition that a pro rata share of the entire year's
earnings may be treated as approximating the actual earnings for the fraction of the year prior to the payment of
the dividend in the absence of circumstances showing that
there were no earnings actually accumulated during the
fractional period; that the amount actually available for
payment of dividends out of the current year's earnings
prior to the date of payment may always be shown; that
such had been the practice of the Treasury Department
from the time the Revenue Act of 1917 took effect until
the date of the Court of Appeals' decision; and that this
rule was embodied in its regulations.
We see no good reason for disturbing the long settled
practice of the Treasury Department. Its contemporary
interpretation is consistent with the language of the Act;
and its practice was, in substance, embodied in the Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, ยง 201 (e), 40
Stat. 1057, 1060. We conclude that the Circuit Court of
Appeals placed an erroneous construction on ยง 31 (b).
Since two of the dividends paid in 1917 were declared
in 1916, it becomes necessary for us to consider whether
these also are to be deemed distributions made in 1917,
as it is only to such that the section applies. It declares
that the dividend is income of the shareholders in the year
in which it is "received." We think it clear that, for this
purpose, the date of payment, not the date of the declaration of the dividend, is the date of distribution; and as
all the dividends here in question were paid in 1917, the
provision as to the rate is applicable to all. As there were
no earnings in 1917 prior to the dates of the payments,
and as there were confessedly ample accumulated earnings
of 1916 prior to the declaration of the several dividends,
we have no occasion to consider other questions which
were argued. The judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals is reversed; that of the District Court is affirmed.
Reversed.
