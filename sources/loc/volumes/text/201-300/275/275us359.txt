With this interpretation of the statute it must be decided that the district court neither in the Glen Murray
case nor in the Cook case had power to grant probation.
It is true that there was but one day of execution of the
sentence in the Murray case, but the power passed immediately after imprisonment began and there had been one
day of it served. The cause is remanded to the district
court with instructions to reverse the order placing Murray upon probation and for further proceedings. In the
Cook case the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the order of the district court of the United States
for the Northern District of Texas granting to Cook
probation is affirmed.

No. 130.

Argued December 7, 1927.-Decided January 3, 1928.

1. A New York banking firm, in order to enable small banks in this
country to draw upon foreign banks with which it had credit,
offered, upon receipt of advice of such a draft accompanied by
funds adequate to cover it and the firm's compensation, to forward
advice of the draft to the drawee bank and to provide the drawee

with funds sufficient for its payment, by transfer of the firm's
credit with the drawee, or otherwise, the drawing bank to act as
principal, and draw in its own name and the firm being employed
merely as agents of the drawer for the purpose of giving such
advice and of providing such funds. In pursuance of this plan,
a Colorado bank, claimant herein, drew and sold its draft on an
Italian bank, notified the firm, requesting that it protect the draft
on presentation, and sent it a check which the firm deposited to its
general account in New York. The firm then sent to the Italian
bank a list of drafts, including drafts issued by itself and by other
banks as well as that of the claimant, with a request to the Italian
bank to protect and honor them and charge them to the firm's
account. The Italian bank so charged them, and credited them in
an account "Drafts Payable." To compensate that bank, the
firm's account ceased to draw interest on the amount so charged.
International banking practice permitted the firm to cancel such
advices if it saw fit, and regain its credit. It did not appear that
the claimant or the holder of its draft knew of the mode of bookkeeping described. Thereafter the firm became bankrupt, the
draft for that reason was dishonored, the drawer took it up, and
claimed special reimbursement from the trustee in bankruptcy for
the amount it paid the firm. Held:
(1) That the sum paid by the claimant to the bankrupt was not
paid upon trust to be applied to the draft. P. 366.
(2) The claimant was not an equitable assignee, pro tanto, of
the bankrupts' deposit with the drawee. Id.
2. The words "Pay from balance against this check," do not import
an assignment. P. 368.

If A purchases from an American banker his draft in
foreign currency upon a foreign bank and procures such
draft from the American banker, he has procured what
he desired in the negotiable obligation of the banker.
The transaction is executed and A has become merely
the owner of the banker's general obligation on the draft.

If A goes to the American banker and pays him American dollars and the banker contracts to establish a credit
for a definite amount of foreign currency in a foreign
bank in the name either of A or A's nominee, then the
contract is not that a specific sum is to be sent abroad,
but rather that a specific credit is purchased, and what
A gets is the banker's contract to establish that credit
for that definite amount. This contract is executory but
results only in A obtaining the general obligation of the
banker^ Legniti v. Mechanics etc. Bank, 230 N. Y. 415;

money, and until the money is sent, will hold it as agent

is that the money he gives to his agent shall be sent
abroad. It is the amount which he gives which is to be
transmitted. Legniti v. Mechanics etc. Bank, 230 N. Y.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTcIC HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

Knauth, Nachod and Kuhne being in bankruptcy, the
respondent, The First National Bank of Trinidad, Colorado, claimed priority in respect of certain funds collected
by the trustee in bankruptcy, the petitioner, from the
Banca Commerciale Italiana; the ground of the claim
being that these funds were charged with a trust in the
hands of the Italian bank. The respondent prevailed in
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 13 F. (2d) 732. A writ
of certiorari was granted by this Court. 273 U. S. 684.
The facts are as follows. The bankrupts had credit
with many foreign banks and to enable small banks in this
country to issue drafts upon such banks in their own name
offered these terms: "Upon receipt of advice of draft, accompanied by adequate funds payable at par in New
York, we shall promptly forward our advice of the same
and provide the drawee with funds sufficient for the payment of the draft abroad, by a transfer of credit from our
balance, or otherwise, provided the draft is drawn on a
bank named in our latest list of correspondents." It was
added that the drawing banks act as principals and draw
in their own name, the bankrupts being employed merely
"as agents of the drawers for the purpose of advising the
issue of their drafts and providing the drawee banks with
sufficient funds to cover their payment." The bankrupts
sent out lists of their foreign correspondents and also daily
rate cards fixing the rate for the various foreign currencies,
including their own compensation, good only for the day
of the date. In accordance with this plan the Trinidad
bank drew a draft on a branch of the Banca Commerciale
Italiana for 24360 lire, sent notice to the bankrupts that
they had sold it "and shall thank you to protect same
upon presentation," and remitted therewith a check for
$1,191.20, which the bankrupts received on May 22, 1923,

275 U. S.

and deposited to their general account. On the same day
the bankrupts sent to the Italian bank and to its branch
a list and description of the drafts issued by inland banks
and by the bankrupts and requested it to "honor the
above listed drafts charging same to our account." The
list was received on or before June 4, 1923; the account
of the bankrupts was debited with the total amount and
to that extent ceased to draw interest, the bank getting
its compensation in this way. At the same time an account termed "Drafts Payable" was credited with the
same amount, this account being credited in the same way
with drafts from other dealers with the bank and the bankrupts themselves. In accordance with the practice in
international banking, the bankrupts when they saw fit to
do so cancelled their advices and were recredited in their
general account; and although in fact they did not cancel
the advice of inland drafts except when requested by the
inland banks, the Italian bank did not know or inquire
into reasons and so far as appears the Trinidad bank, or
at all events the holder of the draft, knew nothing of the
mode of bookkeeping described.
The draft was presented after the petition in bankruptcy had been filed and was dishonored; the petitioner
as drawer had to take it up and now claims on the two
grounds that the sum paid by it was paid upon trust to be
applied to the draft, and that as holder of the draft it is,
by subrogation, an equitable assignee of the bankrupts' deposit with the drawee. The first of these need not detain
us. Beecher v. Cosmopolitan Trust Co., 239 Mass. 48.
Legniti v. The Mechanics & Metals National Bank, 230
N. Y. 415. The identity of the fund was not maintained
and no one expected it to be. See National City Bank v.
Hotchkiss, 231 U. S. 50, 56, 57. The bankrupts undertook to 'forward' advice but only to'provide'the drawee
with funds. The second contention was that which prevailed below. Of course there is room for difference if

Opinion of the Court.

the parties did not express very clearly what they wanted
or meant, but we are led to a different conclusion whet~her
the reliance be upon the rights of the holder or upon the
original contract between the respondent and the bankrupts. In the first place the ignorance of the whole affair
on the part of the holder and the general understanding
that the party dealing immediately with the bank having
the 'Bills Payable' account is master of it, as between
himself and the bank, are quite inconsistent with the
notion that an entry on that account is the appropriation
of a fund to the holder's use. The respondent tries to
give a different turn to the evidence but the master's finding and our own conclusion from the testimony leave no
doubt in our minds. It is true that after such an entry
the interest allowed to the depositor stops but that is only
a convenient way of giving compensation to the bank. It
is not uncommon in. commercial transactions to see some
of the elements of an earlier or a half imitated transaction
appear, although the essentials of the transaction are not
there. Whether a fund was appropriated or not depended
wholly on the dealings between the bankrupts and the
Italian bank; and both of them dealt with the account as
subject to the bankrupt's control. The cessation of interest was for the benefit of the bank because the account
was only with its general funds, and did not have any
assets especially set aside and appropriated to it-in short
was a bookkeeping device for the convenience of the bank.
Again, the terms offered by the bankrupts to their
correspondents seem to us to promise the appropriation
of a specified fund to the draft as little as they promise
to apply the money received by them to that end. They
are to provide the drawee banks with sufficient funds for
the payment of the drafts by transfer of credit 'from our
balance or otherwise'. They are to provide, that is, as
convenient to themselves, for payment by the drawee
banks, not to give them an earmark corpus to be

handed over. They are requested by their correspondents to protect the drafts, which again means merely to
see that they are paid. Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Ry.
Co. v. Ham, 114 U. S. 587, 596. People dealing with
large banks do not ordinarily seek the ambiguous security
of an identified fund, they are satisfied if the bank gives
them credit. We see no indications that the Trinidad
bank was not perfectly content to know that it would
have credit with the Banca Commerciale, and that in the
usual course of things its drafts would be paid. Evidently with this conception of their duties the bankrupts
asked the Italian bank "to protect to the debit of our
account the drafts" in question and others, and the branch
bank to "honor the above listed drafts." That such a
letter of advice is not an assignment is clearly explained
in Eastman Kodak Cd. v. National Park Bank, 231 Fed.
Rep. 320, 323; (affirmed, 247 Fed. Rep. 1002.)
We have called the instrument under which the respondent claims as assignee, a draft. But on its face it is
called 'check'. The form was a general form furnished
by the bankrupts and the purpose is said to have been
that in continental Europe or some parts of it checks are
not subject to the same stamp tax as drafts. It is said in
a reputable work that the fact that the instrument purports to be drawn upon a deposit is what constitutes it a
check. Daniels, Negotiable Instruments, 6th ed., §1569.
The existence of this opinion sufficiently explains the
words of the document before us 'Pay from balance
against this check'. They no more purport to assign a
fraction of a fund than does an ordinary check. They
would not naturally take that shape as the respondent,
the drawer of the check, had no fund in the hands of the
drawee.
The decision of this case depends more upon the general
import of the transaction and upon what the parties were

EQUITABLE TR. CO. v. FIRST NAT. BANK.

likely to want than upon the phrases that can be picked
out from the several steps. We repeat that in our opinion what the parties meant to establish and what the
respondent got was the assurance of a credit abroad to
the extent of its check as in the case of a letter of credit,
not an attenuated property right in an account to which
no special funds were attached and the particulars of
which neither the respondent nor the purchaser of the
check could know.
Order revered.
MR.JUSTICE STONE,

dissenting

The agreement of the bankrupts, on the faith of which
petitioner sold its draft, did more than stipulate that the
draft should be paid on presentation. It provided specifically the method of payment; that the bankrupts
should "promptly," on notice of the draft, "provide the
drawee with funds sufficient for the payment of the draft
abroad, by a transfer of credit or otherwise." It plainly
contemplated the course of business, actually followed, in
which a credit, t6 be established with the drawee, was to
be set apart and specifically appropriated to the payment
of the draft. The draft was by its terms made payable
from "balance against this Check."
We need not discuss what the petitioner's rights would
have been if no such credit had been established, for here
the bankrupts had performed their contract fully and to
the letter. They set apart the stipulated credit. Withdrawal of it by them would have been a violation of their
contract with petitioner, for the contract contained no
intimation of a right to revoke it, and if the receiver had
not done what they had no right to do the draft would
have been paid. Nor does it appear to me that the real
question is whether the Italian bank was charged with a
trust with respect to funds lodged with it by the bankrupts. It may be assumed that it was not a trustee, but

only a debtor to the bankrupts for the funds thus received,
with power to discharge the debt pro tanto by payment
of the draft when presented.
Stated with precision the question seems rather to be
whether, since the bankrupts had performed their agreement by specifically designating and setting apart enough
of their credit with the Italian bank to meet the draft,
the credit thus set apart is to be treated in equity as
security for the payment of the draft. If subject to that
equitable obligation, neither the bankrupts nor the receiver could convert the credit, so set apart, into cash and
turn the proceeds over to general creditors freed of that
obligation.
Since Holroyd v. Marshall, 10 H. L. Cas. 191, it has been
generally accepted doctrine, the recording acts permitting,
that an agreement to hold property which the promisor
may afterward acquire as security for the payment of a
debt, operates in equity once the property is acquired, to
give the stipulated security to the promisee in preference
to general creditors. Such is the rule in this Courf.
Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90. I had supposed it to be
equally well settled that the agreement need not mention
the word " security" to accomplish that result, if its plain
purpose is to provide 'for the satisfaction of a debt or
obligation out of identifiable property. Compare Walker
v. Brown, 165 U. S. 654; Ingersoll v. Coram, 211 U. S. 335;
Hurley v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry., 213 U. S. 126;

Implement Co. v. Moulden, 228 Fed. 111; Curtis v.
Walpole Tire & Rubber Co., 218 Fed. 145. There has
been no dissent from the view that an agreement to apply
a designated credit or account to the payment of a check
or draft drawn upon it creates security in the credit enforcible in equity as against general creditors. Fourth
Street Bank v. Yardley, 165 U. S. 634; Farley v. Turner,

20; Muller v. Kling, 209 N. Y. 239; In re Hollins, 215
Fed. 41. Equity, in making such agreements effective,
does no more than it habitually does in compelling the
performance of an agreement to give a mortgage to secure
advances made on the faith of the agreement.
Both parties to this transaction knew that American
drafts drawn on European banks would be worthless unless
definite arrangement for their payment by the drawee was
made in advance of their presentation, and that where, as
here, a particular credit-was set apart for that purpose the
utility of such drafts would be seriously impaired if the
credit, once established, could be cancelled at will. No
intelligent banker would sell such drafts if the establishment of such a credit were not contemplated. A bank
here, drawing and selling such drafts against a credit to
be established abroad by others, pledges its own credit to
the payee and is secured against loss and the dishonor of
its drafts only in so far as it may insure the creation of
the appropriate credit and retain the benefit of it once it
is created. The stipulation that the bankrupts should
promptly set apart a credit for that purpose upon receipt
of advice of the draft and advise the drawee of it was a
material inducement to petitioner to pledge its own credit
by the sale of its draft. Once performed it is valuable
security to both payee and drawer, if it is permitted to
have the legal sanctions which ordinarily attach to agreements of this character.
The evidence in this case appears to me, as it did to
the court below, to fall far short of establishing a practice
or custom, or any rule of Italian law, permitting the depositor, while the drafts are outstanding, to cancel or
control for his own purposes the credit set apart for their
payment. Our own rule is that a bank of deposit may
not, with impunity, ignore the known equitable rights of
others to the credit established by its depositor, National
Bank v. Insurance Co., 104 U. S. 54, and it would seem

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Syllabus.

275 U. S.

that that rule should be applied here in determining the
rights of the parties in the absence of proof of any other.
But in any case, such control, if retained by the bankrupts
as between themselves and the Italian bank, could not be
rightfully exercised in violation of their contract with
petitioner.
The case would therefore seem to be a proper one for
the application of the rule announced by this Court in
Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, supra, that a court of
equity will lend its aid to carry into effect an agreement
that an obligation shall be satisfied out of a specified
credit. Applied here that rule would make effective the
intention of the parties and give stability to a large and
important class of banking transactions. The judgment
should be affirmed.
