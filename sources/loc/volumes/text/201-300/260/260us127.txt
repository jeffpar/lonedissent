Syllabus.

Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 329. But without considering how
the line would be drawn, when such action took place in
the improvement of navigation, it is enough to say that,
this is an ordinary case of incidental damage which if
inflicted by a p-ivate individual might be a tort but which
could be nothing else. In such cases there is no remedy
against the United States. See Bedford v. United States,
192 U. S. 217, 224.
Judgment affirmed.

McKEE ET AL. v. GRATZ.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 61. Argued October 13, 16, 1922.-Decided November 13, 1922.
1. The Missouri statute declaring that title to all birds, game and
fish shall be in the State, Rev. Stats. Mo. 1909, § 6508; 1919,
§ 5581; speaks only in aid of the State's power of regulation, leaving the land owner's property in these things otherwise unaffected.
P. 135.
2. Unlike wild birds and fish, live mussels, which have! practically a
fixed habitat in the bottom of a stream and little ability to move,
are in the possession of the owner of the land, as are, even more
obviously, the shells taken from such mussels and piled 'upon the
bank. P. 135.
3. Such possession is enough to warrant recovery of stbstantial damages for conversion by a trespasser. P. 136.
4. But a license to take such mussels from uninclosed and uninhabited
places may be implied from custom, the more readily where statutory prohibitions are limited to enclosed and cultivated land and
private ponds, as by Rev. Stats. Mo. 1919, § 5662, 3654. ' P. 136.
5. The existence of such custom ane license, and -whether it extends
beyond occasional uses to systematic extraction of mussels in large
quantities for commercial purpose, held, for the jury. P. 136.
6. Live musls in %streaimare iot part of. the realty within the
meaning of Rev. Stats. Mo. 1909, § 5448; 1919, § 4242, allowing

mussel shells which were dug from a stream-bed on his
land (then of his assignor) and converted into buttons;.
also for triple damages, under a Missouri statute.

he so reduce them on the lands of another. Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 523-526.
It is within the power of the State to take unto itself
whatever right the land owner might otherwise assert at
common law to game or fishes reduced to possession by a
trespass on his premises. Geer v. Connecticut, supra;

original owner by virtue of his own wrong cannot apply in
this case, because (a) the shell gatherers acted in good
faith upon a well-founded belief that they had a right to
gather the mussels, and (b) the petitioners are innocent
purchasers from an unintentional or inadvertent tres.passer. Railway Co. v. Hutchins, 32 Oh. St. 571.
Mr. S. Mayner Wallace for respondent.
The rights of the parties should be determined just as
if the thing taken had been o much lime. After being
dug, boiled and shucked, the shells were piled and stored,
for from ten days to one month, on the same lands, before
being taken to the factory.
But, if the law pertaining to the ownership of animals
be applied, the earthy, harmless, inoffensive, phlegmatic
mussel ought not to be classed as a wild animal; but,
rather, as a tame or domestic animal, in which event the
land owners' rights of property were, of course, absolute,
at all times. State v. Taylor, 27 N. J. L. 117; Fleet v.
Hegeman, 14 Wend. 42; State v. Van Vlack, "101 Wash.
503; Duchess of Sutherland v. Watson, 6 MacPher. 199
(6 Scot. Sess. Cas., 3d Ser., p. 199).
" Whether any particular animal be of one class or the
other, is to be determined by our knowledge of the habits
of the class to which it belongs, as derived from the general observation and experience of naturalists." 3 Minor
Inst., p. 7. Dogs, Sentell v. Neu Orleans & Carrollton

The Missouri statute of 1905; § 6508, Rev. Stats. Mo.,
1909;, § 5581, Rev. Stats. Mo., 1919, providing that title
to all birds, game and fish shall be in the State "for the
purpose of regulating and controlling the use and disposition of fhe same," is not-adverse to plaintiff's position, even if it be said, arguendo,that damages are sought
for the taking of the mussel rather than for the shell.
The opposite construction would render such an enactment unconstitutional, if applied in circumstances here
disclosed. The statute'refers only to game, fish and birds
that are "not now held by private-ownership," and was
enacted after the plaintiff's assignors acquired the land.
But the statute only intends to make effective the State's
police-power-interest, not to affect the citizen's privateproperty-ownership, as developed in the course of the
common law.
Since Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, the
ownership of birds, fish and game, so far. as vested in the
sovereign, has been uniformly regarded, not in a proprietary sense, but as a trust for the benefit of all the people
in common. Hartman v.,Tresise, 36 Colo. 146; Arkansas
v Mallory, 73 Ark. 236; Schulte v. Warien, 218 Ill. 108;

The land owner's possession, and right to the possession,
of the shells (dug and stored on their lands), as against
defendants, who had no better, or any, right or title, is,
in and of itself, sufficient. The jus tertii is not available
to defendants. - Armory, v. Delamirie (Smith's L. Cas.),

The fact of navigability vel non, under the present record, is a question whici-is probably not now open; the
trial court found that the waters were not navigable.

McKEE v. GRATZ..
127

Argument for Respondent.

The opinion of the Court of Appeals demonstrates, that
the waters were. non-navigable in fact and in law. And
see Brewer-Elliott Oil Ca. v. United States, 270 Fed. 102;
[s. c. 260 U. S. 77] ; Act March 2, 1919, c. 95 § 4, 40 Stat.
1275, 1287; Slovensky v. O'Reilly, 233 S. W. 478. But,
even if navigable, the rights of the parties Would still bethe same; for the general right of user of such a.navigable.
stream is strictly limited to highway purposes. HobartLee Tie Co. v. Grabner,206 Mo. App. 96.
The public right of navigation does not include or give
the right to fish; hunt or trap where title to the underlying land is privately held. Annotation, 11 A L. R. 241;
fish, Schulte v. Warren, 218 Ill. 108; muskrats, Johnson v.
Burghorn, 212 Mich. 19.
That the plaintiff's assignors had the exclusive right of
fishing, is clear from the foregoing, and from the following,
authorities: Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S. 371; State v.
Blount, 85 Mo. 547; Thompson v. Tennyson, 148 Ga. 701;
Hartmanv. Tresise, 36 Colo. 146; State v. West Tennessee
Land Co., 127 Tenn. 575; Hooker v. Cummings, 20
Johns. 90.
There was no plea of any custom or of any implied
license. Custom, from which any benefit may be derived,
must be a lawful custom. Adams v. Clark, 189 Ky. 279.
The right to hunt or fish asserted is a profit a prendre;
and the law seems clear that "a claim by custom to enjoy
a profit a prendre in the soil of another is invalid and insupportable, for the reason that to allow such a claim
would *result in the destruction of value in the subject
of the profit." 9 R. C. L., p. 745.
The value of the manufactured product, into which the
shells passed, furnishes the proper measure of damages
recoverable under the first count; and the Missouri statute, allowing treble damages in certain instances, applies
under the second count.
Defendaiits made no inquiry, concerning ownership,

MR. JUsTicE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

Court,
This is a suit broughtby the respondent, who is also a
cross-petitioner, .to recover the value of mussel shells
removed fromthelrands of the respondent's assignor and
manufactured by the petitioners into buttons. It was
brought in a Court of the State of Missouri, but was
removed to the District Court of the United States.
There were, two counts; one simply for the conversion of
the shells and a second alleging that the shells were part
of the, realty and that the plaintiff was entitled to treble
damages under Rev. Stats. Mo. 1909, a 5448. (Rev.
Stats. Mo. 1919, § 4242.) At the trial thq District Court
directed a verdict for the defendants, and the judgment
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 258 Fed.
3351- The main question was disposed of on the ground
that by the Statutes of Missouri, Rev. Stats. 1909,
.. 6508, 6551, the title to the mussels was in the State.

McKEE v. GRATZ.
127

Opinion of the Court.

As to the second count it was held that the mussels were
not part of the realty. Later, a rehearing was granted,
and while the Court adhered to its former opinion on the
second count, it rightly, as we think, held that the statutes declaring the title to game and fish to be in the State
spoke only in aid of the State's power of regulation and
left the plaintiff's interest what it was before.' See Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416,.434. It.assumed that the
defendants were trespassers and sent the case back for a
new trial on that footing, the damages to be confined to
the value of the shells at the date of conversion and not
to include that subsequently added by manufacturing
them into buttons. 270 Fed. 713.
The mussels were taken alive from the bottom of what
seems to have been at times a flowing stream, at times
a succession of pools, were boiled on the banks and the
shells subsequently removed. As to the plaintiff's title,
it is not necessary to say that the mussels -were part of
the realty within the -meaning of the Missouri Statutes
or in such sense as to make the plaintiff an absolute
owner. It is enough that there is a plain distinction
between such creatures and game birds or freely moving
fish,, that may shift to another jurisdiction without regard
to the will of land owner or State. Such birds and
fishes are not even in the possession of man. 252 T. S.
434. 2 Kent, Comm. 349. Young v. Hichens, 6 Q. B.
606. On the other hand it seems not unreasonable to say
that mussels having a practically fixed habitat and little
ability to move are as truly in the possession of the owner
of the land in which they are sunk as would be a prehistoric boat discovered under ground or unknown property at the bottom of a canal. Elwes v. Biigg Gas Co.,
33 Ch. D. 562. Reg. v. Rowe, Bell, C. C. 93. Barker v.
Bates, 13 Pick. 255. This is even more obvious as to the
shells, when left piled upon the bank, as they were, to

await transportation. Northern. Pacific R. R. Co. v.
Lewis, 162-U.'S. 366, 378, 382. Possession is enough to
warrant recovery of substantial damages for conversion
by a trespasser. We say nothing about the character of
the stream as to navigability. The jury at least might
fifid that there was nothing in that to prevent the application Df what we have said. We are slow to believe that
there were .public rights extending to the removal of
mussels against the land owner's will.
But it cannot be said as matter of law that those who
took the mussels*were trespassers; or even wrongdoers in
appropriating the shells. The strict rule of the English
common law' 's to entry upon a close must be taken to
be mitigated by common understanding with regard to
the large, expanses of unenclosed and uncultivated land
in many parts at least of this country. Over these it is
customary to wander, shoot and fish at, will until the
owner sees fit to prohibit it. A license may be implied
from the habits of the country. Marsh v. Colby, 39
Mich. 626. In Missouri the implication is fortified by
the limit of statutory prohibitions to enclosed and cultivated land and private ponds. Rev. Stats. 1919, §§ 5662,
3654. There was evidence that the practice had pre-'
*ailed in, this region. Whether those who took these
mussels were entitled to rely upon it, and whether, if
entitled tb rely upon it for occasional uses, they could
do so to the extent'of, the considerable and systematic
work that was done were questions for the jury.- They
could ot be disposed of by the Court. The implication
of a license of the kind that we have mentioned from
general understanding and practice does not encounter
the difficulties that have been' suggested in implying a
license from conduct alone in cases where the same conduct after twenty years might' generate an. easement, it
being a plaif-contradiction' to imply ad interim a license
which would prevent" the acquisition of a prescriptive

right. Chenery v. Fitchburg R. R. Co., 160 Mass.
211, 212.
As to the rule of damages in case the plaintiff recovers,
n the absence of a decision by the Supreme Court of the
State we should not regard the mussels as part of the
realty within the meaning of the statute relied upon in
the second count, and so faras appears at present we see
no reason for charging the defendants, if at all, with more
than the value of the mussels at the time of conversion,
as ruled below. Wetherbee v. Green, 22 Mich 311.
Wooden-Ware Co. v. United States, 106 U.. S. 432. Union
