we are discussing.
The result is that the petitioner as defendant was not
obliged to set up and prove its action at law under Rule
30, and when it did so, by its affirmative action, it waived
its previous objection to the equitable jurisdiction and
also its right of trial by jury. An analogous effect of
such affirmative action in pressing a counterclaim is seen
in Merchants Heat & Light Co. v. J. B. Clow & Sons,
204 U. S. 286, 289, 290, where a non-resident corporation,
having saved its right to object to the service of summons,
lost it, not by answer, but by a counterclaim.

Statement of the Case.

was brought in the County Court, and the defendant having failed to set the cause for jury trial within the time
fixed by statute, it was heard by the court, which made
findings of fact that under the state practice are conclusive on review by the Supreme Court. The County Court
gave judgment for the Realty Company. The Town took
the case on exceptions to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court summarized the findings of fact
by the County Court as follows:
"During the winter of 1918-19, the plaintiff cut pulp
wood, in all about 10,000 cords, in the towns of Jamaica,
Stratton, Londonderry, and Winhall in this State. The
plaintiff maintains a mill at Hinsdale, in the State of New
Hampshire, about three miles below Brattleboro, where
its pulp wood is rossed and bolted. The wood, cut four
feet long, was placed upon the banks of West River and
its tributaries to be floated down into the Connecticut
and thence to its destination at the mill in Hinsdale. The
waters of the West River are wholly in this State and7
empty in the town of Brattleboro into the Connecticut.
West River and its tributaries had been used for driving
pulp wood to the mill at Hinsdale in the year5 1917 and
1918. A single log boom is provided at the mill to receive
the wood floated down the river, but is incapable of holding it all when the water in the Connecticut is high and
the current swift, and the wood is liable to be carried overand drawn under the boom and lost. A pond of considerable size is formed near the mouth of West River in the
town of Brattleboro by water set back from the Connecticut by the dam at Vernon. Plaintiff maintains a boom at
this point to hold and control the logs driven down West
River until the water in the Connecticut has receded sufficiently to permit of their being held in the boom at Hinsdale.
"On March 25, 1919, the plaintiff began putting the
pulp wood into the West River and its tributaries, the

water in these streams then being high, intending to driVe

it down the river and thence into the Connecticut and
down that river to its mill in Hinsdale. In anticipation
of the probable high water in the Connecticut, plaintiff
had previously placed its boom across West River near
its m outh to hold ihe wood there until the water in the
Connecticut had receded enough to allow it to be held at
the mill at Hinsdale. The wood'floated down West River
on the high water, and at the head of the drive reached
the boom at the mouth of West.River on March 27, 1919.
At that time the Connecticut was so high and its current
so 'swift that it was not thought safe to let the wood into
that river, as it could not be held at the Hinsdale boom.
For this reason and no other the plaintiff held its wood in
the boom at Brattleboro. The Connecticut was not suitable for driving pulp wood from the time the drive began
until April 3d, on which date the plaintiff's servants cut
the boom at the mouth of West River so that the wood
could pass into the Connecticut.' Prior to April 3d, only
about 4,000 cords of the wood had reached and been held
at the West River boom. The balance arriving later went
through to Hinsdale without stopping. On March 28,
1919, when there was by' estimation about 4,000 cords of
wood in the West River boom, it broke, allowing some of
the wood to escape into the Connecticut and onto the
Retreat meadow in Brattleboro near the mouth of West
River. The boom was repaired on March 29, 1919.. At
this time the part of West River where the wood lay back
of the' boom, called the holding ground, was frozen, so the
wood, if not boomed, could not have continued on its
journey into the Connecticut at that time. On April 1,
1919, about 1,500 cords of the pulp wood was being held
in plaintiff's boom at the, mouth of West River. Some
wood that was lodged on an island and the wood on the
Retreat meadow remained after the boom was cut. The
latter remained on the meadow about two weeks and had

to be taken out by a process called 'booming' or 'warping.' None of this 1,500 cords was cut in the town of
.Brattleboro. 'All of it had been carried down West River
and was destined for the plaintiff's mill at Hinsdale, N. H.,
by way of the Connecticut. The drive of pulp wood down
West River to the Connecticut and thence to the rossing
plant at Hinsdale was in continuous operation from March
25th until it was completed on May 9th, and was conducted properly to make an uninterrupted passage, so far
as possible."
On these findings the Supreme Court held that the
interstate transit did not begin until the wood left the
Brattleboro boom. Everything before that was merely
preparations. The floating of the logs from the West
River towns to Hinsdale was interrupted, and the interruption, although only long enough to secure safety in
the drive, was for the. benefit of the owner and in law
postponed the initial step in the interstate transit until
the wood was released from the Brattleboro boom. The
court, therefore, held the wood taxable at Brattleboro
and reversed the County Court.

The facts clearly establish that the immediate destination of the wood, when it was started from the forest, was
the pond behind the boom at the mouth of West River in
Brattleboro. The wood was cut in the various towns in
the West River Valley, and floated down the tributaries
of West River, and that river itself, until it was gathered
together in that safe haven, the pond, caused by the setback of the water of the, Connecticu't, behind the plaintiff's boom, called the " holding ground." The petitioner's

The interpretation given to findings of fact of a lowercourt by the State Supreme Court is binding here.
The findings of fact referred to when read as a whole
and in the light of the specific findings, as to what actually took place, clearly support the interpretation given to
them by the Vermont Supreme Court, namely, that at the
time of the assessment of the tax, April 1, 1919, the pulp
wood "was then at iest in the boom at Brattleboro for a
time necessarily indefinite and for a purpose beneficial to
'the plaintiff." The plaintiff made preparations long in
advance of starting the wood down West River and its
tributaries to stop the wood in the "holding ground" at
Brattleboro. It built and maintained a boom there, and
as early as the middle of March, ten days before any of
the wood started down the river, it "placed its boom
across West River near its mouth and in the town of
Brattleboro for the purpose of holding the wood in the
West River until the water in the Connecticut had receded enough to allow the wood to be held on said river
at plaintiff's said mill at Hinsdale." For whose " convenience and benefit" was this boom at the mouth of
West River built and maintained if not for tle convenience and benefit of the plaintiff?

Opinion of the Court.

The plaintiff apparently loses sight of the distinction
between the cases where property is delivered to a common carrier for transportation out of the State and the
cases where property, as in this case, is being transported
by the owner and is at all times under its control.
The plaintiff had the privilege of continuing the transportation, but of this it might avail itself or not as it
chose.. It might sell the wood in Vermont or forward
it, as it saw fit. It was in its possession with the.control
of absolute ownei'ship. It may have intended, at an indefinite thne, to forward the wood to its rossing mill in
rinnsdale, N. H., but this intention, while ihe wood renained hi the boom at Brattleboro and before it had been
started from the boom on its final journey, did, not make
it immune from local taxation.
In an action to recover money paid as a tax the burden
is upon the plaintiff to show that the tax was illegally assessed; or, to be specific, to establish the inqterstate character of the transportation.
EIM.
CBimF JUSTICE TWT after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Vermont Supreme Court depended for its conclusions chiefly upon.Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, which is the
leading case on this subject. There logs had been cut on
Wentworth's Location in New Hampshire during the
winter, and had been drawn down to Errol in- the same
State, and placed in Clear Stream and on the banks
thereof on lands of John Akers and part on land of
George C. Demerritt in said town, to be from thence
floated down the Androscoggin River .to the State of
Maine (p. 518).
It is not clear how long they had lain there, but certainly for part of one winter season. This Court. speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, sought to fix the time when

260 U. S.

such logs, in the course- of their being taken froni New
Hampshire -to Maine, ceased to be part of the mass of
property of New Hampshire and passed into the immunity from state taxation as things -actually in interstate commerce. The) leairned Justice states the rule to.
be "that such goods do not cease to be part of the general
mass of property in the State, subject, as such, to its
jurisdiction, and to taxation in the usual way, until they
have been shipped, or entered with a common carrier for
transportation to 'another State, or have been started
upon such transportation in a continuous route or
1
journey." (P. 527.)
Again,. on page 528, Justice Bradley said: "The carrying of them in carts -or other vehicles, or even floating
them, to the depot where the journey is to commence is
no part of-that journey. That is all preliminary work,
performed for the purpose of putting the property in a
state of preparation and readiness for transportation.
Until actually launched on its way to another State, or
committed to a common carrier for transportation to such
State, its destination is not fixed -and certain. It may
be sold or otherwise disposed of within the State, and
never put in course of, transportation out of the State,
Carrying it from the farm, or the forest, to the depot, is
oly an interior movement of the property, entirely
within the State, for the purpose, it is true, but only for
the putrpe, of puting it into a course of exportation;
it is no part of, the e portation itself. Until shipped or
started on its final journey out of the State its exportation is a matter altogether in fieri, and not at all a fixed
and certain thing.
"The application of these principles to the present case
is obvious. The'logs which were taxed, and the tax on
which -was not abated by the Supreme Court of New
Hampshire, had not, when so taxed, been shipped or
started on their final voyage or journey to the State of

CHAMPLAIN CO. v. BRATTLEBORO.
366

373

Opinion of the Court.

Maine. They had only been drawn down from Wentworth's Location to Errol, the place.from which they were
to be transported to Lewiston in the State of Maine.
There they were to remain until it should be convenient
to send them to their destination." (P. 528.)
The question here then is, Where did the interstate
shipment begin? When the wood was placed in the
waters of the West River in the towns of Jamaica, Stratton, Londonderry and Winhall, or at the boom in Brattleboro? The whole drive was ten thousand cords. Six
thousand cords of that, shipped from these towns after
the third of April, went through directly to Hinsdale,
New Hampshire, without stopping. Certainly that was
a continuous passage and the wood when floating in the
West River was as much in interstate commerce as when
on the Connecticut. Why was it any more in interstate
commerce than that which had been shipped before April
3rd from the same towns for the same destination by the
same natural carrying agency, to wit, the flowing water
of the West and Connecticut Rivers? Did the fact that
before April 3rd the waters of the Connecticut were
frozen, or so high as to prevent the logs reaching Hinsdale, requiring a temporary halting at the mouth of the
West River, break the real continuity of the interstate
journey? We think not. The preparation for the interstate journey had all been completed at the towns on the
West River where the wood had been put in the stream.
The boom at tie mouth of the West River did not constitute an entrepot or depot for the gathering of logs
preparatory for the final journey. It was only a safety
appliance in the course of the journey. It was a harbor
of refuge from danger to a shipment on its way. It was
not used by the owner for any beneficial purpose of his
own except to facilitate the safe delivery of the wood at
Hinsdale on their final journey already begun. The logs
were not detained to. be classified, measured, counted

260 U. S

or in any way dealt with by the owner for his benefit,
except to save them from .destruction in the course of
their journey that but for natural causes, over which he
could exercise no control, would have been aq.ually continuous. This was not the case in Coe v. Errol: It is
evident from the statement of that case, and Mr. Justice
Bradley's language, that the logs-were partly drawn and
partly floated to Errol and' deposited some in the stream
and some on the banks, where " they were to remain until
it should be convenient to send them to their destination," and, they were being gathered there for the whole
previous winter season. It was an entrepot or depot
as the Justice several times describes it. The"mere fact
that the owner intended to send them out of the State
under such circumstances did not put them into transit
in interstate commerce. But here, we have the intention
put into accomplishment by launching, and manifested
by an actually continuous journey of more than half the
drive, with a halting of less than half of it in the course
of the interstate journey to save it from loss, and only
for that purpose.
The case at bar. is easily distinguishable from the
other cases cited by the Vermont Supreme Court. In
Bacon v. Illinois, 227 U. S. 504, Bacon had bought shipments of grain in transitu from Western States to New
York in the contract for which the carriers had given the
shipper the right to remove it "for the mere temporary
purposes of inspecting, weighing, cleaning, clipping drying, sacking, grading or mixing, or changing the ownership, consignee or destination." On arrival of the grain
in Chicago, Bacon removed the grain from the cars to
his private elevator. This removal was for the purpose
of inspecting, weighing, grading, mixing, etc., but not to
change its ownership, consignee or destination. It was
held that whatever his intention, the grain was at rest
within his complete power of disposition and held for his

CHAMPLAIN CO. v. BRATTLEBORO.
366

.375

Opinion of the Court.

own benefit and was taxable. His storing of the grain
was not to facilitate interstate shipment of the grain, or
save it from the danger of the journey. It was to enable
him to treat the grain so as to enable him more conveniently to dispose of it. He made his warehouse a
depot for its preparation for further shipment and sale.
He had thus suspended the interstate commerce journey
and brought the grain within the taxable jurisdiction of
the State.
So, in General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, the Oil
Company had its principal place of business in Memphis,
Temessee, for the manufacture and sale of illuminating
oils in interstate commerce. It imported oil from other
States and put it into a tank, appropriately marked for
distribution in smaller vessels to fill orders for oil already
sold in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The Court
held.that ihe first shipment had ended, that its storage
at Memphis for division and distribution to various
points was for the business purposes and profit of the
company. The Court . continued: "It was only there
for distribution, it is said, to fulfill orders already received. But to do this required that the property be
given a locality in the State beyond a mere halting in its
transportation." (P. 231.) The tank at Memphis thus
became a depot in its oil business for preparing the oil
for another interstate journey. So far as it bears upon.
this case, American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, 192 U. S.
500, presented a similar state of facts and ruling.
In Diamcnd Match Co. v. Ontonagon, 188 U. S. 82, the
company cut one hundred and eighty million feet of
timber for the purpose of saving the same from fire
and to protect and preserve it put. it into the Ontonagon
River, Michigan. It was drawn down to ihe mouth of
the river into -the township of Ontonagon, Michigan, to
the sorting ground and pier jams of the company, and
there it was taxed. The logs remained there and were

376

Opinion of the Court.

260 U. S.

shipped as they were needed to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to
the mills of the company. Not more than forty million
feet a season were needed. Palpably the company's sorting grounds and pier jams were a depot for the kleeping
of the logs for the business purposes of the company and
there was no interstate commerce until the final shipment to Green Bay began.
In the cases of Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S: 622, and
Pittsburg & Southern Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S. 577,
the coal in barges-in the Mississippi River which was the
subject of taxation had come to rest in Louisiana, after
a trip from Pittsburg, and was being held for sale to anyone who might wish to, buy.
The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution
does not give immunity to movable property from local
taxation which is not discriminative, unless it is in actual
continuous transit in interstate commerce. When it is
shipped by a common carrier from one State. to another,
in the course of such an uninterrupted journey it is
clearly immune. The doubt arises when there are interruptions in the journey and when the property in its
transportation is under the complete control of the owner
during the passage. If the interruptions are only to promote the safe or convenient transit, then the continuity of
the interstate trip is not broken. State v. Engle, 34 N. J.
L. 425; State v. Carrigan,39 N. J. L. 35. This was the
case in -,Kelley v. Rhoads, 188 U. S. 1, in which sheep,
driven 500 miles from Utah to Nebraska, which travelled
nine miles a day, were held immune from taxation in
Wyoming where they stopped and grazed on their -way.
Another instance is as to that part of the logs,in Coe v.
Errol, which were not before this Court because the
Supreme Court of New Hampshire had found them nontaxable in New Hampshire. They were cut in Maine and
were floated down the Androscoggin on their way to
Lewiston, Maine, but were delayed for a season at Errol,

UNITED. STATES v. LANZA.

Syllabus.

New Hampshire, because of low water. In the cases just
cited the transit had begun in one State and was continued through another on the way to a third. This circumstance strengthened the inference that the interruption in the intermediate State, did not destroy interstate
continuity of the trip. But this is not always so, as
Bacon v. Illinois and General Oil Co. v. Crain show. In
other words, in such cases interstate continuity of transit
is to be determined by a consideration of the various
factors of the situation. Chief among these are the intention of the owner, the control he retains to change
destination, the agency by which the transit is effected,
the actual continuity of the transportation, and the occasion or purpose of the interruption during which the tax
is sought to be levied,
Of all the cases in this Court where such movable property has been held taxable, none is.nearer in its facts
than'Coe v. Errol to the case at bar' We.have pointed
out the disthiction between the two which requires a different conclusion here.
