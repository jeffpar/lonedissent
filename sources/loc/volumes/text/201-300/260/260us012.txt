ercise of functions necessary to its administration. To
this accommodation, Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board
of Commissioners of Everglades Drainage District, 258
U.- S. 338, is not militant. The case concedes the power
6fxratification and declares the principle upon which it is
based-and, necessarily, recognized the subjection and obligaiion of persons and- property to government, and for
government, and its continuation for the purposes of government., And the recognition precludes a misunderstanding of the case and its extension beyond its facts.
It was. concerned with an attempt to impose a charge for
the use of a government canal, for which use, at the time
availed -of, there was no charge-an attempt, therefore, to
turn a gratuity conferred and enjoyed into a legal obligation and subject it to a toll.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 167. Argued October 3, 1922.-Decided October 16, 1922.
The objection that a tax on a special class of persons and property
for a public purpose by which they are not benefited, is a taking
of property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Ameifdment, does not apply to the general income tax of
Massachusetts (Acts, 1916, c. 269, § 2, 5 (b), as amended, 1919,
c.324, § 1) and use of funds so derived (Acts, 1919, c. 363) to reimburse cities and towns for increase of educational salaries. P. 14.

A general tax is a tbx assessed upon all the taxable persons and all the taxable property within the taxing distriet, in order to pay the public expenses of the district as
a whole.
Special assessments, on the other hand, are assessed.
on only a part of the taxable property in the district, in
order to defray the expense of a particular public improvement, and are apportioned in proportion to the
benefit received by the property taxed from the establishment of such improvement. Illinois CentralR.-R. Co.

A special tax is a tax levied for a particular public
purpose upon the property benefited by the carrying out
of that purpose, but apportioned according to ability to
pay. Common examples of this tax are district taxes,
which are assessed on all the property in a road district
to pay for a road, or in a watch district to pay for police
protection, or" in a school -district to pay for 4 school.

A perpetual appropriation out of the proceeds of a tax
levied annually by a permanent statute is equivalent to
the levy of a tax for the purpose of the appropriation. A
taxpayer has a constitutional right to refuse to pay a tax
which is not levied for a lawful purpose, Citizens' Savings & Loan Assn. v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655; Green v.
Frazier, 253 U. S. 233.
The statute diverting part of the proceeds of the income tax and the statute imposing an additional income
tax must be considered together as parts of one and the
same law. Ir ternationalPaperCo. v. Massachusetts,246

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In Massachusetts taxes of a kind that used to be im.posed by the cities and towns now are imposed and collected by the Commonwealth and afterwards distributed
to the cities and towns to be expended for various-public
purposes. - In this way are collected and distributed, with
necessary exceptions, taxes upon the interest from debts,
dividends from stock and from partnerships, Gen. Acts
1916, c. 269, § 2, and upon the excess over two thousand
dollars per annum of income derived from professions and
business, again with necessary exceptions, id. § 5(b), both
as amended. Dane v. Jackson, 256 U. S. 589. The latter
tax, under § 5(b), was increased one per cent. for the
years 1918 and 1919 by an Act of 1919, c. 324, § 1. The
validity of these taxes per se is not disputed. They make
a comprehensive income tax. But by an Act of 1919, c.
363, the Treasurer and Receiver General is directed to set

Opinion of the Court.

aside and pay over to the cities and towns from the proceeds of the income tax a sum sufficient to reimburse-them
for specified increases of salaries of school teachers, supervisors, superintendents and the like. Thereupon the
plaintiff in error, a taxpayer, brought this suit, a petition
for mandamus, to prevent the respondent from paying
over as directed, contending that the Act of 1919, c. 363,
imposed a public charge upon a special class of property
and persons not specially benefited by the services and
for that reason was a taking of property without due
process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Supreme Judicial Court, waiving questions of procedure, held that the income tax was a general tax; that
the proceeds of the tax became part of the general funds
of the State; that these funds could be expended for education, and that there was no appropriation of such a
character as to make the tax a special tax for a special
purpose or use. The petition was dismissed.
We see no reason for not accepting the views taken by
the Supreme Judicial Court. The plaintiff in error asks
us to connect the increase of the tax for two years by the
Act of 1919, c. 324, with the reimbursement directed by
c. 363, which he assails. This cannot be done, especially
not for the purpose of attributing to the Legislature an
attempt to achieve by indirection a result supposed to be
beyond its power. The reimbursement from the general
funds of the Commonwealth was lawful and to make it
the funds must be provided. The fact that the end was
contemplated, if it was, in this particular increase, is no
more than was necessary in some form to bring about the
result.
Judgment affirmed.
