CERTIORARI, 293' U. S. 542, to review the reversal of a

judgment dismissing an action brought by a receiver of
a national bank to recover an assessment on shares made
by the Comptroller of the Currency.

Mr. George P. Barse, with whom Messrs. Will L. Hoyt

and F. G. Awalt were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The respondent, receiver of an insolvent national bank,
brought this action in the federal court for the district of
Utah against the petitioner to recover an assessment made
by the Comptroller of the Currency. That court held him
not entitled to recover. The Circuit Court of Appeals

reversed. 71 F. (2d) 264.

shares to their son, who is the petitioner here, and their
daughter. The will was probated in the district court of
Juab county, Utah, and petitioner was appointed administrator with the will annexed. Before decree of distribution he and the daughter transferred all their rights to
their mother.
March 11, 1920, the court made an order reciting that
the estate had been closed, and approved and settled
the administrator's final account, and on the next day it
entered its decree directing that the property belonging to
the estate be distributed to the widow. The administrator made distribution as ordered. The property so
transferred included the bank stock, other personal property and real property. Shortly after the distribution, the
widow deeded to her daughter some of the real estate and
to the petitioner the balance which is still held by him
and worth more than $2,000. Respondent says, and we
assume, that these conveyances were made without consideration. As petitioner knew, the stock was not transferred on the books of the bank but continued to stand
in the name of his father.
After distribution the bank paid a dividend to its stockholders and sent petitioner a check payable to the estate
covering the amount applicable to the six shares. He deposited the check in his mother's account in the bank, informed its officers that the stock belonged to her, and
suggested that thereafter checks for dividends be made to
her. July 4, 1931, she died, having no property other
than the bank stock. November 17, 1931, petitioner applied to the court to be discharged as his father's administrator. November 18, having found the certificates covering the six shares among his mother's effects, he delivered them to the bank to be held for her estate. December 1, the court granted his application for discharge.
The bank closed the same day. The Comptroller appointed respondent receiver and, March 8, 1932, made an

assessment of $100 on each share of the stock. Petitioner
refused to pay the assessment on the shares formerly
owned by his father.
The complaint asserts devastavit in that the petitioner
as administrator failed to pay into court or to retain
property sufficient to cover the assessment, or to transfer
the stock to a solvent person, and disposed of the entire
estate except the stock. It also alleges that the real
property deeded petitioner by his mother, having been
conveyed to him without consideration, is subject to a
lien for the amount of the assessment. The case was
tried without a jury. At the close of the evidence, respondent moved for judgment against petitioner personally and, if that be denied, for transfer of the case to
the equity side and a decree against the real property.
Petitioner moved for judgment. The court denied respondent's motion and granted that of petitioner. The
Circuit Court of Appeals held petitioner had not committed devastavit, but that, as the stock stood on the
books of the bank in the name of the deceased, his estate
remained liable and that petitioner held the real property
subject to the assessment. It remanded the case to the
district court, directed its transfer to equity, and that decree be entered in conformity with its opinion.
Title 12, U. S. Code, § 64, provides that "The stockholders of every national banking association shall be
held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and
engagements of such association, each to the amount of
his stock therein, at the par value thereof in addition to
the amount invested in such stock. . . ." And see § 63.
Section 66 provides that "Persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall not
be personally subject to any liabilities as stockholders;
but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in
like manner and to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust funds

would be, if living and competent to act and hold the
stock in his own name."
The liability of stockholders is based upon the statute,
§ 64.1 As a general rule, the person in whose name the
stock stands on the books of the bank is liable,' but the
actual owner may be held although the stock has not been
registered in his name. The liability does not altogether
cease on the death of the owner but, as limited and defined by § 66, attaches to his estate.4 The fiduciaries are
exempt but the property belonging to the estate is liable
as would be the deceased if living. No cause of action
arises until the assessment is made by the Comptroller
and, so far as concerns the need and amount, his findings
are conclusive. He acts under federal authority, and in
respect of determinations, orders and assessments may
not be trammeled, controlled or prevented by state laws.6

FORREST v. JACK.
158

Opinion of the Court.

In the absence of federal enactments relating to procedure
for enforcement of the liability imposed by § 66, collection
is to be made in accordance with state laws governing
claims against estates of deceased persons, at least to the
extent that such laws are not inconsistent with enforcement of the liability imposed by national authority."
There is no suggestion that the laws of the State of Utah
discriminate against or are inadequate for the just and
convenient enforcement of liability imposed, § 66, against
estates of deceased stockholders. There can be no liability on account of assessments made after complete
administratijn, final distribution of all the property and
the extinguishment of the estate.
In this case, the Comptroller's assessment was made
more than eleven years after complete distribution and
long after decedent's widow as distributee became the
actual, though not the registered, owner of the stock, and
liable under § 64. The decree of March 11, 1920, closed
the estate. The fact that the administrator was not
formally discharged until December 1, 1931, about the
time the bank failed, is without significance here, as the
Comptroller's assessment was not made until March 8,
1932. As the estate had ceased to exist before the bank
became insolvent, the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly
held that petitioner as administrator was not required
by Utah law (R. S., 1933, § 102-9-26) to retain or pay
into court any property or money to cover possible future
liability in respect of the stock that had been decreed
and distributed to the widow. There is nothing to support the allegation of devastavit.
Section 102-9-28 provides: "When the accounts of the
administrator or executor have been settled and an order

made for the payment of debts and distribution of the
estate, no creditor whose claim was not included in the
order for payment has any right to call upon the creditors who have been paid, or upon the heirs, devisees or
legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim.
Viewed in the light of that provision, it is plain that the
distribution fully extinguished the estate. It follows that
petitioner's real estate that had belonged to decedent
never became liable for the assessment.
In Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S. 521, relied on by the
court below and by respondent, this court, affirming the
supreme court of Minnesota (70 Minn. 519, 73 N. W.
416; 73 Minn. 170, 75 N. W. 1041) held the estate not
to have been extinguished when the bank became insolvent or when the assessment was made. The facts of
that case were similar to those now before us. The estate of a deceased stockholder of a national bank was,
after administration, fully distributed without a transfer
of the stock on the books of the bank. Later, because
of its insolvency, the Comptroller closed the bank and
made an assessment against its stockholders. He brought
suit and obtained judgment against Idistributees under
and in accordance with the General Statutes of Minnesota, 1894, § 5918, which declares: "The next of kin of
a deceased person are liable to an action by a creditor of
the estate, to recover the distributive shares received out
of such estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary
to satisfy his debt . . ." That this statute utterly differs from that of Utah (§ 102-9-28) clearly appears from
the opinions of the Minnesota supreme court. In the
first one it said (p. 522): "The claim here in question was
a contingent claim, which did not become absolute until
after the time to file claims had expired, and the estate
was distributed to the widow, heirs and next of kin.
Under these circumstances, the plaintiff may maintain
an action under G. S., 1894, c. 77, [which includes

§ 5918] against the distributees to recover of them the
amount of the liability, not exceeding the amount of the
distributive share received by each." On the second appeal, the court overruled the contention that the liability
of each distributee was limited to the amount of the bank
stock he received from the estate. And this court, following and interpreting these decisions and affirming the
judgment, held that, although the property had been allotted and delivered to the persons thereunto entitled under the decree of the probate court, the estate had not
been extinguished but continued to exist subject to the
liability defined in § 66. As by Minnesota law-contrary to that of Utah--decedent's estate after distribution continued to be subject to the enforcement of
claims, that case does not support respondent's contention here.
The judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals is reversed and that of the
District Court is affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS FOR SUMTER
COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 434. Argued December 11, 12, 1934.-Decided February 4, 1935.
1. The liability of a decedent's estate to be assessed as stockholder of
a national bank for the debts of the bank, depends upon the federal
law, Title 12 U. S. C., §§ 64, 66; and a ruling of a state court
against such liability necessarily depends upon a construction of
that law and is reviewable under § 237 (b) of the Judicial Code.
P. 168.
2. For want of capacity, a minor is not subject to assessment on national bank shares sought to be distributed to him as part of a
decedent's estate, though in form they were transferred to his name
on the books of the bank. The estate continues to be liable as
stockholder under Title 12- U. S. C., § 66. P. 168.
