to include the method claimed by respondent. These
claims were rejected by the Patent Office as reading on
the British Patent 178,442 of the present patentees, and
the Greensfelder patent, already mentioned. However
inconsistent this early attempt to procure a patent may
be with petitioner's present contention of its invalidity for
want of invention, this Court has long recognized that
such inconsistency affords no. basis for an estoppel, nor
precludes the court from relieving the alleged infringer
and the public from the asserted monopoly when there is
no invention. Haughey v. Lee, 151 U. S. 282, 285.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 255.

Argued February 5, 1935.-Decided March 4, 1935.

1. The bringing together of old elements in a mechanism involving
no new principle, to produce an old result, however skillfully it
be done, and even though the result mark an advance in efficiency
and utility, is but an exercise of mechanical skill and not invention. P. 4S6.
2. It is the claims of a patent that define the invention. P. 487.
3. A deficient claim can not be aided by reading into it parts of
other claims or of the specifications. P. 487.
4. A plain absence of invention is not overcome by evidence of
utility and commercial success of the thing patented, even though
the evidence indicate that a long-felt want was satisfied. P. 4S7.

Statement of the Case.

294 U. S.

5. Utility and. commercial success are not persuasive evidence of
invention where the want satisfied by the device patented was not
long-felt or generally recognized at the time of the patent application but arose later as an incident to a subsequent advance in the
art attendant upon the creation of a new public demand and
upon the development of numerous devices not covered by the
patent. P. 488.
6. Under R. S., ยง 4917, a patentee is not permitted to add by disclaimer a new element to the combination previously claimed,
whereby the patent, originally for one combination, is transformed
into a new and different patent for the new combination. Such
a disclaimer is void. P. 490.
7. A patent amended by disclaimer speaks from the date of the
original patent; a reissued patent (R. S., ยง 4916), with respect to
the claim amended,, speaks from the date of the re-issue. P. 491.
8. The filing of a disclaimer abandons the claims affected, and they
can not be revived upon the ground that the disclaimer was
invalid. P. 492.
9. Patent No. 1,713,726, issued May 21, 1929, to Vogt et al., for
"a device for phonographs with linear phonogram carriers," held
void for want of invention as to claims numbered 5, 7, 17, 18,
and 19, relating to a combination apparatus for securing uniformity of speed in machines used for recording talking motion
pictures, in which the gist of the invention claimed consists of the
addition of a flywheel to the cylinder over which the film or
ribbon passes near the "translation point" at which the sound is
recorded upon or reproduced from it; also held void as to claim 9,
originally allowed for the arcuate flexing of the film record, and
claim 13, for a combination for projecting a narrow line of
light upon and through the moving film to a photo-electric cell,
both of which claims were invalidated by attempts to add the
flywheel device by disclaimers. Pp. 480, 488.

CERTIORARI,

293 U. S. 528, to review the affirmance of

decrees in favor of the present respondents in two suits
brought by them for infringement of their patent. For
the District Court's opinion see 5 F. Supp. 32.' The cases
were tried together and were brought here on a single
record. One of the plaintiffs, American Tri-Ergon CorporatioT', claimed as owner of the patent. The other,
Tri-Ergon Holding, A. G., claimed as licensee.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Merrell E. Clark and Thomas G. Haight, with
whom Messrs. Charles Neave and Henry R. Ashton were
on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, with whom Messrs. S. Mortimer Ward, Jr., Page S. Haselton, and Hugh M. Morris
were on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE STONB delivered the opinion of the Court.

These cases come here on certiorari to review a decree
of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 72 F. (2d)
53, which affirmed a decree of the district court, 5 F. Supp.
32, holding valid and infringed the patent of Vogt and
others, No. 1,713,726, of May 21, 1929, applied for March
20, 1922, for a" device for phonographs with linear phonogram carriers." The two cases were tried together and
have been brought here on a single record.
Petitioners, the defendants below, are operators of motion picture theatres whose sound reproduction machines
are said to infringe certain claims of the patent in suit.
The Radio Corporation of America is defending both cases
on behalf of its subsidiary, R. C. A. Photophone, Inc.,
which supplied the petitioners' machines. Respondents,
plaintiffs below, are a patent holding company and a
licensee.

Of the nineteen claims of the patent, seven are in issue.
Five of them, numbered 5, 7, 17, 18 and 19, relate to a
device for securing uniformity of speed in machines used
for recording and reproducing talking motion pictures, and
are referred to as the "flywheel claims." They may conveniently be considered separately from Claims 9 and 13
which present the flywheel claims in a different aspect.
Claim 9, as originally, allowed, was for the arcuate flexing
of the film record; Claim 13 similarly was for a combination for a means for projecting a narrow line of light upon
and through the moving film to a photoelectric cell in

sound reproduction. A disclaimer, filed by respondent
shortly before the trial, purports, in varying terms, to add
the fly-wheel device to each of these claims.
While both courts below have found invention and sustained the patent, the Court of Appeals, as will presently
appear in more detail, did not pass on the separate claims
in issue, but found invention in a combination of elements
not embraced in any single claim. In consequence, the
case presents no question of concurrent findings by the
courts below that the claims in issue severally involve invention, see Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, 269 U. S.
177, 180.
The Flywheel Claims.
"Phonograms," or sound records, for the recordation and
reproduction of sound, are of several types. They include
discs or cylinders to which, and from which, sound vibrations are transmitted mechanically by a stylus in the course
of recording, and reproducing, sound. Long strips of waxed
paper carrying sound record grooves, similarly made, are
used. Other types are long strips of film on which sound
is photographically recorded, and long steel wires on which
sound variations have been magnetically recorded. The
claims relate to an improvement in mechanisms for recording and reproducing sound by the use of linear photographic record carriers. The typical procedure in recording and reproducing sound by the use of photographic film
strips is described in ParamountPublix Corp. v. American
Tri-Ergon Corp., decided this day, ante, p. 464, and need
not be repeated here.
Both in recording and reproducing sound, by any form
of record, uniform speed in the movement of the phonogram is of the highest importance, in order to secure evenness and regularity in the reproduced sound. The specifications state:
"The recording and the reproduction of sound waves by
the use of linear phonogram carriers such as film strips,

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 481
477

Opinion of the Court.

steel wires, and so forth, can only be effected in absolutely
satisfactory manner, even after the removal of all other
occurring difficulties, when the speed of the record carrier
is uniform both for the receiving and the reproduction, and
when in both cases no variations of any kind occur. Especially in the case of musical reproductions is the record
extremely sensitive to the slightest variations of speed."
They also point out that linear phonograms such as the
photographic film, because of their lightness and their
want of the momentum afforded by a revolving cylinder
or disc record, are peculiarly susceptible to irregularities
of movement caused by the play or friction in the projections and connections of the many parts of the propelling
apparatus, and declare that:
"According to the present invention, this draw-back
which attaches to all hitherto known propulsion mechanisms for linear phonogram records is obviated by the
arrangement, that the light sound record has given to it
at the controlling point the property of a weighty mass.
This is attained by the arrangement that the record carrier (a film strip or the like) is firmly pressed against one
or more rollers connecting with a heavy rotating mass, so
that the record moves in exact conformity with the rollers
and the rotating mass."
The references to a "weighty mass" or "a heavy rotating mass" used to secure uniformity of motion are to
the familiar flywheel. The specified "property" of a
rotating heavy mass is inertia, the tendency of matter in
motion to continue in motion, the force of which is increased by the mass of the moving body. It is the property which gives to the flywheel its peculiar efficacy in
securing uniformity of speed in mechanisms with which
it is associated.
The first three flywheel claims, 5, 7 and 17, are apparatus claims. The others, 18 and 19, are, in form, method
claims, defining the method of securing uniformity in

482

294 U. S.

movement of the record film by apparatus defined by
Claims 5 and 17. Claim 5 reads as follows:
"In phonographic apparatus in which the sound record
is formed on an elongated ribbon of inconsiderable mass,
having feeding perforations therein, the combination of
[a] means for supporting and progressing the record
ribbon from one point to another point and past an
intermediate point at which the record is made on
the ribbon in recording or from which the record is
taken from the ribbon in reproducing, including
[1] a toothed cylinder over a portion of which the
ribbon passes adjacent to said intermediate
point, the teeth of said cylinder engaging the
perforations of the ribbon,
[2] a fly-wheel associated with said cylinder, and
[3] means for rotating said cylinder, under control of
said fly-wheel at uniform speed."
Claim 17 is substantially the same as Claim 5, the principal difference being that it uses the word "cylinder"
instead of "toothed cylinder."
Claim 7 adds to the essentials of Claim 5 "a resilient
connection between said driving member [the shaft] and
fly wheel, and stop means for limiting the amount of yielding of said resilient connection." This so-called flexible
or elastic flywheel connection, designed to overcome more
gradually the inertia of the flywheel, and thus to secure
an improved flywheel operation, was anticipated, among
others, by the Constable Patent, U. S. No. 1,425,177, of
August 8, 1922, applied for June 24, 1918' as the district
court found. Its inclusion in Claim 7 may therefore be
disregarded as adding nothing more to the present patent
than the flywheel without it.
There is no serious contention, nor could there well be,
that the combination apparatus, for moving the linear
record past the translation point at which the sound is
recorded or reproduced, involves invention without the
flywheel. Mechanisms for moving linear strips, or rib-

Opinion of the Court.

bons, by passing the strip over a revolving drum or cylinder, are a familiar type in the arts. They have long been
used in the motion picture industry when it was desired
to employ the linear strips at an intermediate point for
sound and picture reproduction, and the like. Such a
mechanism, for moving a picture film past the translation
point in a motion picture projector, is shown by the Holst
Patent, U. S. No. 587,527, of 1897. A like mechanism
for recording or reproducing sound, or both, by the use of
linear photographic records, is shown in the British Duddel
Patent, No. 24,546, of 1902, and the Reis Patent, U. S.
No. 1,607,480, of 1923, filed May 21, 1913. Still other
mechanisms, like two of the figures attached to the specifications of the patent in suit, show the translation point
at the film-carrying cylinder. Examples are the patents
of Bock, U. S. No. 364,472, of 1887; Byron, U. S. No.
1,185,056, of 1916; and Pedersen, British Patent No. 115,942, of 1918. The gist of respondent's contention, as is
shown by the claims and the parts of the specifications
already quoted, is that by the addition of the flywheel to
this familiar mechanism the patentees have succeeded in
producing a new type of machine for recording and reproducing sound by the photographic film method. It is
insisted that the new device, because of its greater accuracy and precision of film movement, is so useful and constitutes such an advance in the sound motion picture art
as to entitle it to the rank of a patentable invention.
The flywheel set upon a revolving shaft is an ancient
mechanical device for securing continuity and uniformity
of motion when brought into association with any form of
machinery moved by intermittent force or meeting with
irregular or intermittent resistance.1 So universal is its
'The addition of the flywheel to the steam engine, in 1758, was
said to be "a very important addition to the engine, and though
sufficiently obvious, it is ingenious and requires considerable skill and
address to make it effective." Robison, Mechanical Philosophy, Vol.
2, p. 105,1822.

use for that purpose in every type of machinery that standard treatises on mechanics, long before the application for
the present patent, gave the mathematical formulae for
ascertaining the appropriate weight and dimensions of a
flywheel, moving at a given speed, required to overcome
known variations in force resistance, and prescribed the
standard procedure for locating the flywheel in as direct
association as possible with that part of the mechanism at
which the intermittent resistance occurs. See article, Mechanics, ยง 121, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, 1911; Angus, Theory of Machines, pp. 261-272, 1917.
The specifications of the patent recognize that disc and
cylinder records themselves operate as flywheels and proceed to show how a want of a similar control may be supplied, in mechanisms used for motion picture film records,
by the addition of the flywheel. But this was specifically
taught by the prior art for the reproduction of sound both
from phonographic and film records. There are in evidence two Edison commercial recording machines with
cylindrical records, which were used at the Edison Recording Laboratory in New York before 1921. Each has a heavy
flywheel mounted directly on the shaft of the record-carrying cylinder. These flywheels produce a high degree of
"speed constancy." An application for a patent by Edison in 1879 on a claim for a combination "with the phonograph cylinder and its shaft, of a flywheel" was rejected by
the examiner-April 7, 1879, as covering the "use of a flywheel as ordinarily used with machinery for the purpose of
securing uniformity of motion." Upon reconsideration the
claim was again rejected on the ground that the adaptation
of the flywheel required only the exercise of "ordinary
good judgment " and not the inventive faculty.
The Underhill Patent, U. S. No. 995,390, of 1911, exhibits a phonograph machine with a flywheel to secure
uniformity of .motion of the record. The specifications

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 485
477

Opinion of the Court.

state that the flywheel is used for that purpose. The patent of Alexander Graham Bell and others (Bell & Tainter),
U. S. No. 341,213, of 1886, discloses a mechanism for recording sound on a photographic plate rotated at uniform
speed under the control of a flywheel. Another patent of
the same inventors, U. S. No. 341,214, of 1886, discloses
a flywheel used in association with a mechanism for moving a linear, wax-coated phonograph record at uniform
speed for recording and reproducing speech and other
sounds. That the record used was not photographic is
unimportant. The problem of securing uniformity of
motion of the record is the same for either type of linear
sound record, as the present patent itself establishes, by
classing together all types of linear records as exhibiting
the "problem" to which the patent is directed. The
French Dragoumis Patent, No. 472,467, of 1914, shows a
film record moved by a cylinder turning on a shaft carrying a large wheel, obviously acting as a flywheel, though
not described as such. See American Road Machine Co. v.
Pennock & Sharp Co., 164 U. S. 26, 38. The flywheel was
mounted on the shaft of the record-carrying cylinder at
the translation point. Finally, the British Pederson Patent, already referred to, shows a photographic sound recorcarried by a cylinder as it passes the translation poin'
His specifications, after pointing out that sound is " exceedingly sensitive to variation in rotating speed," and
that it is necessary to obviate this during the recording
and reproducing operations, state that this may be done
"by providing particularly large flywheels."
There are numerous patents showing the like use of
the flywheel in apparatus for reproducing motion pictures
from film. That of Holst, already noted, shows in detail
an apparatus exhibiting every element of Claim 5 except
that its use is for reproducing motion pictures instead of
sound from film. The toothed cylinder is located adjacent

486

294 U. S.

to the intermediate point which is the point of translation.
The flywheel is associated with the cylinder by being
attached to the rotary shaft carrying the cylinder.
An improvement to an apparatus or method, to be
patentable, must be the result of invention, and not the
mere exercise of the skill of the calling or an advance
plainly indicated by the prior art. Electric Cable Joint
Co. v. Brooklyn Edison Co., 292 U. S. 69, 79, 80. The inclusion of a flywheel in any form of mechanism to secure
uniformity of its motion has so long been standard procedure in the field of mechanics and machine design that
the use of it in the manner claimed by the present patent
involved no more than the skill of the calling. See American Road Machine Co. v. Pennack & Sharp Co., supra,41.
Patents for devices for use both in the motion picture art
and in the art of sound reproduction, notably the Holst,
the Bell & Tainter, the Dragoumis patents, and the Edison
application, already noted, plainly foreshadowed the use
made of the flywheel in the present patent, if they did not
anticipate it. The patentees brought together old elements, in a mechanism involving no new principle, to produce an old result, greater uniformity of motion.
However skilfully this was done, and even though there
was produced a machine of greater precision and a higher
degree of motion-constancy, and hence one more useful in
the art, it was still the product of skill, not of invention.
Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368; Grinnell Washing Machine Co. v. Johnson Co., 247 U. S.426, 432-434;
Powers-Kennedy ContractingCorp. v. Concrete Mixing &
Conveying Co., 282 U. S.175, 186. Its application in recording sound or reproducing it, by use of a particular
type of linear record, the photographic, analogous so far
as the problem of uniformity of motion was concerned to
other types used by Bell & Tainter and Dragoumis, was
not invention. See ParamountPublix Corp. v. American
Tri-Ergon Corp., ante, p. 464.

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 487
477

Opinion of the Court.

There is some suggest-ion in respondent's brief and argument that the location of the flywheel adjacent to the
toothed cylinder is an element in the invention which contributed to the success of the mechanism. But as has
already been indicated such location is but the teaching of
the art. In any case, the claims call only for the flywheel
located upon the shaft or in association with the cylinder.
No particular location is mentioned.
The Court of Appeals, in upholding the patent, made
no examination of its separate claims, but treated the patent throughout as though it were a combination of five distinct elements, the photoelectric cell, the arcuate flexing
of the film, the flywheel, the flexible connection of the flywheel and the optical slit, although nowhere in the patent
is any such combination claimed. The patent thus upheld
is one which was neither claimed nor granted. Under the
statute it is .the claims of the patent which define the invention. See White v. Dunbar, 119 U. S. 47, 51, 52;
McClainv. Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419, 423-425; The Paper
Bag Patent Case, 210 U. S. 405, 419; Smith v. Snow, ante,
p. 11. And each claim must stand or fall, as itself sufficiently defining invention, independently of the others.
See Carltonv. Bokee, 17 Wall. 463, 472; Russell v. Place,
94 U. S. 606, 609; Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking
Machine Co., 213 U. S. 301, 319; Symington Co. v. National Malleable Castings Co., 250 U. S. 383, 385; Smith
v. Snow, supra; Walker on Patents, ยง 220, 6th ed. As none
of the flywheel claims as drawn define an invention, none
can be aided by reading into it parts of the specifications,
or of other claims, which the patentees failed to include
in it.
The court below, attributing the rapid development of
the sound motion picture industry to the invention in the
patent in suit, thought, as respondent earnestly argues here,
that its utility and commercial success must be accepted.
as convincing evidence of invention. But we think that

488

294 U. S.

want of invention would have to be far more doubtful
than it is to be aided by evidence of commercial success,
indicating that it brought realization of a long-felt want.
Smith v. Dental Vulcanite Co., 93 U. S. 486, 495, 496;
Grant v. Walter, 148 U. S. 547, 556; DeForest Radio Co.
v. General Electric Co., 283 U. S. 664, 685; compare
McClain v. Ortmayer, supra, 428. Moreover, the record
fails to show that there was any long-felt or generally
recognized want in the motion picture industry for the
device defined by the flywheel claims, or that the use of
sound motion pictures was delayed by the inability of those
skilled in the art to add a flywheel to the apparatus in order
to give the desired uniformity of motion to linear phonograms. See Paramount Publix Corp. v. American TriErgon Corp., supra. There was no public demand for
sound motion pictures before 1926, when the disc system
of the Western Electric Company was first publicly used
in conjunction with moving pictures. Before change to the
photographic film system could be accomplished, it was
necessary to await the development of numerous electrical devices not embraced in the present claims. Among
them were adequate amplifiers, loud speakers and microphones. Progress in the perfection of these appliances was
achieved rapidly after the public acceptance of the sound
picture in 1926, through the efforts of many independent
workers in the field: When the need arose for a mechanism
suitable to move film records with such speed-constancy as
to reproduce the sound successfully, it was forthcoming.
Only the skill of the art was required to adapt the flywheel
device to familiar types of mechanism to-secure the desired
result.
Claims 9 and 13.
The court below made no reference to the contention of
)etitioner, urged here and below, that the patent was renlered invalid by the disclaimer filed shortly before the

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 489

Opinion of the Court.

trial of the present suit. The patent as issued contained
the following claims:
"9. The method of translating sound or similar vibrations to or from a film record by the use of light varied in
accordance with the sound, which comprises flexing the
film arcuately longitudinally at the point of translation
and rapidly and uniformly moving the film in a circumferential direction past said point."
" 13. An apparatus for reproducing speech, music or the
like sounds from vibrations recorded on a film, by the use
of a line of light varied in accordance with the sound, comprising a photoelectric cell, means for imparting to the
film a rapid and uniform motion longitudinally of the film
past said cell, a source of light projection for pro-ding
said light, and an objective lens in the path of said light
and spaced from the film for directing said light as a
converging narrow line impinging on the film at a point
in the region of the focal point of said lens, said light passing through the film and on to said cell, the space between
said lens and the film being free of obstructions to said
light."
In 1933 respondents, by appropriate procedure, disclaimed:
"(b) The method as set forth in claim 9, except wherein the uniformity of movement of the film past thb translation point is effected by subjecting the portion of the
film passing said point to the control of the inertia of a
rotating weighty mass.
"(c) The combination as set forth in claim 13, except
wherein a flywheel is operatively connected with the film
through means which imparts uniformity of motion of
the flywheel to the film."
While the effect of the disclaimer, if valid, was in one
sense to narrow the claims, so as to cover the combinations originally appearing in Claims 9 and 13 only when
used in conjunction with a flywheel, it also operated to

add the flywheel as a new element to each of the combinations described in the claims. The disclaimer is authorized
by R. S. ยง4917, which provides that when "through inadvertence, accident, or mistake . . . a patentee has claimed
more than that of which he was the . . . inventor . . .

his patent shall be valid for all that part which is truly
and justly his own," provided that he or his assigns " make
disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he shall
not choose to claim . . . stating therein the extent of his

interest in such patent." While this statute affords a wide
scope for relinquishment by the patentee of part of the
patent mistakenly claimed, where the effect is to restrict
or curtail the monopoly of the patent,2 it does not permit
the addition of a new element to the combination previously claimed, whereby the patent originally for one
combination is transformed into a new and different one
for the new combination.
'The disclaimer and re-issue statutes were adopted to avoid the
rule that if one claim is invalid the whole patent is void. Moody v.

445, 452; Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., 123 U. S. 582, 589. The use of
the disclaimer has been upheld where the elimination from the patent
of the matter not relied upon did not operate to enlarge the monopoly
of the patent, but narrowed it, as by eliminating in their entirety
some of the claims of the patent, Sessions v. Romadka, 145 U. S. 29,

Co., 112 U. S. 624, 642, or by striking out an alternative method or

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 491
477

Opinion of the Court.

If a change such as the present could validly be made,
it could only be under the provisions of the re-issue statute, R. S. ยง 4916, which authorizes the alteration of the
original invention in a re-issued patent, upon surrender
of the old patent, for its unexpired term. Upon the reissue "the specifications and claim in every such case
shall be subject to revision and restriction in the same
manner as original applications are." A patent amended
by disclaimer thus speaks from the date of the original
patent, while the re-issued patent, with respect to the
amended claim, speaks from the date of re-issue. If respondent could thus, by disclaimer, add the flywheel to
the arcuate flexing claim and to the optical claim, he
would in effect secure a new patent operating retroactively
in a manner not permitted by the re-issue statute and
without subjecting the new claims to revision or restriction
by the customary patent office procedure required in the
case of an original or re-issued patent. Such transformation of a patent is plainly not within the scope of the
disclaimer statute, and the attempted disclaimer as applied to Claims 9 and 13 is void. Hailes v. Albany Stove

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

294 U. S.

148 U. S. 547, 553. It is unnecessary to consider whether
the flywheel claim, if added to the original Claims 9 and
13, is such a part of the patentee's driginal conception as
to entitle it to the benefit of the re-issue statute. See
Miller v. Brass Co., 104 U. S. 350, 355; Hoffheins v. Russell, 107 U. S. 132, 141; Gage v. Herring, 107 U. S. 640, 645;
Ives v. Sargent, 119 U. S. 652, 663; Corbin Cabinet Lock
Co. v. Eagle Lock Co., 150 U. S. 38, 41-43.
With the invalid disclaimer must fall the original claims
as they stood before the disclaimer. The disclaimer is a
representation, as open as the patent itself, on which the
public is entitled to rely, that the original claim is one
which the patentee does not, in the language of the statute, "choose to claim or hold by virtue of the patent."
Upon the filing of the disclaimers, the original claims were
withdrawn from the protection of the patent laws, and the
public was entitled to manufacture and use the device originally claimed as freely as though it had been abandoned.
To permit the abandoned claim to be revived, with the
presumption of validity, because the patentee had made
an improper use of the disclaimer, would be an inadmissible abuse of the patent law to the detriment of the public.
While the precise effect of an invalid disclaimer upon
the original claim seems not to have been judicially determined, analogous principles of the patent law are so well
recognized as to leave no doubt what our decision should
be. It has long been settled that a claim abandoned or
rejected in the patent office with the acquiescence of the
applicant cannot be revived in a re-issued patent. Yale
Lock Co. v. Berkshire Bank, 135 U. S. 342, 379; Dobson v.
Lees, 137 U. S. 258, 263-265. Nor can an interpretation
be given the allowed claims which would revive the claims
which were abandoned in order to obtain 'the patent.
Shepard v. Carrigan,116 U. S. 593, 597; Roemer v. Peddie,
132 U. S. 313, 317; Royer v. Coupe, 146 U. S. 524, 532;
Corbin Cabinet Lock Co. v. Eagle Lock Co., 150 U. S. 38,
40; Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Paper Co., 152 U. S.

ALTOONA THEATRES v. TRI-ERGON CORP. 493
477

Opinion of the Court.

425, 429; I. T. S. Rubber Ca. v. Essex Rubber Co., 272
U. S. 429, 443; Smith v. Magic City Club, 282 U. S. 784,
789, 790; Smith v. Snow, supra. Similarly, where, in order to secure a re-issued patent, a disclaimer is made of a
part of the original claims, the part so disclaimed cannot
be revived by a second re-issued patent, Leggett v. Avery,
101 U. S. 256, nor where the disclaimer is for the purpose
of securing an extension of the original patent, Union
Metallic Cartridge Co. v. U. S. Cartridge Co., supra, 644.
See Collins v. Coes, supra, 68; compare Gage v. Herring,
supra, 646. The settled rule that unreasonable delay in
making a disclaimer invalidates the whole patent, Ensten
v. Simon, Ascher & Co., 282 U. S. 445, 452-458; compare
O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 121; Seymour v. McCormick, 19 How. 96, 106; Silsby v. Foote, 20 How. 378, 387;
Gage v. Herring, supra, 646; Yale Lock Mfg. Ca. v. Sargent, 117 U. S. 536, 554; MineralsSeparation,Ltd. v. Butte
& Superior Mining Co., 250 U. S. 336, 354, rests upon the
similar principle that misuse of the patent, or a part of it,
by the patentee in such a manner as to mislead the public
or operate to its detriment, deprives the claim of the benefit of the patent laws. The part of the patent disclaimed
can stand in no better position because the disclaimer was
an unsuccessful misuse of the disclaimer statute.
As Claims 9 and 13 must be held invalid because of the
improper disclaimers, and as the remaining claims in issue,
the flywheel claims, are held invalid for want of invention,
it is unnecessary to determine whether the improper disclaimers as to some of the claims render the entire patent
void, as petitioners contend, and as has been intimated
but not decided. See Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., supra,
589; Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. DeForest Radio
Tel. & Tel. Co., 243 Fed. 560, 565 (C. C. A. 2d); Seiberling
v. Thropp's Sons Co., 284 Fed. 746, 756, 759 (C. C. A. 3rd).
Reversed.
