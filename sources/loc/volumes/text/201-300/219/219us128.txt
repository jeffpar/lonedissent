ENGEL v. O'MALLEY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 703.

Argued December 15, 16, 1910.-Decided January 3, 191n.,

The rule, that one not within the class cannot raise objections to the
constitutionality of a statute on the ground of discrimination against
that class, applied to effect that one who for more than five years
has resided in the United States cannot object that a state statute
denies equal protection of the law because it excludes those who have
not so resided for that period.
Protection of banking business, especially that transacted in small
amounts, (Noble State Bank v. Haskell, ante, p. 104), and with poor
and ignorant immigrants on first arrival in this country is within the
police power of the State; and , state statute imposing special and
proper restrictions on those engaging in that class of banking is not
unconstitutional under the due process or equal protection clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment because it excepts from its provisions
other banks and bankers engaged in other classes of banking business or conducting them under other conditions.
The receipt of money by a bank where the depositor can withdraw it
when and in such sums as he pleases, although creating a debt, is, in
a popular sense, the receipt of money for safe-keeping.
Where the subject is within the police protection of the State, it is not
for the court to determine whether the enactment is wise or not;
that is within legislative discretion.

Courts will presume from general knowledge of business affairs that
transmission of money through bankers is made bv drafts and nnt
by sending the identical currency.
Legislation which regulates business may well make distinctions depend upon the degree of evil; Heath & Milligan Co. v. Worst, 207

U. S.338; and, although where size is not an index, a law may not
discriminate between the great and the small, proper regulations
based thereon where size is an index of the evil to be prevented, do
not offend the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
There are always difficulties in drawing the dividing line between that
which is within, and that which is without, the constitutional power
of the States, and the question in each specific case must be answered by the pertinent facts therein.

ENGEL v. O'MALLEY.
219 U. S.

Argument for Appellant.

A state statute regulating the receipt of deposits of money is not a
burden on, or regulation of, interstate or foreign commerce simply
because such deposits are likely to be transmitted to other'States or.
foreign countries; the deposit is an independent transaction preceding the transmission.
The provisions of the private banking act of New York of 1910, considered: in this case, are not unconstitutional as depriving persons
engaged in the receiving and .transmitting of small sums of money of
their property without due process of law or denying them the equal
protection of the law either on account of the regulations to which
such persons are subjected or by reason of the exception of other
classes of banks and bankers therefrom.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles Dushkind for appellant:
The provision' that deprives persons residing in the
United States for less than five years of the right to carry
on such business violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356.
A statue that is repugnant to the Constitution is not
voidable by judicial decisions but is absolutely void. Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U. S. 441; Ex parte Young, 209
U. S. 129.
It is self-operating; it has no legal inception and never
had a legal existence. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co.,

The statute is unconstitutional because it gives the
Comptroller arbitrary power to deprive appellant of his
right to carry on his business. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118

Argumefnt for Appellant.

219 U. S.

The statute is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment,
because it contains unjust discriminations. Cotting v.
Godard, 183 U. S. 79; Cooley, Const. Law, 556; Corn v.
Clark, 195 Pa. St. 634; State v. Gravette, 65 Ohio, 289; Connolly v. UnionSewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540; Magoun v. Ill.
Trust Co., 170 U. S. 283; Am. Sugar Ref. Co. v. Louisiana,
179 U. S. 89. Cases upholding classifications as to sale
of liquor; territorial classifications; those in respect to
the learned professions; health laws or taxation, cannot
be applied in the case at bar.
The right to engage in the banldng business is a common law right belonging to individuals and to be exercised
at their pleasure, and the State may simply regulate it;
the business is inherently a lawful one that may be carried
on by anyone subject only to such reasonable regulations
as may be provided by statute. It has no relation to
public health nor to public morals, and there is indeed a
wide distinction between the banking business and the
occupations where public health or public morals is involved. Butchers' Union v. Crescent City, 111 U. S. 746;
Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519
"Private banker" denotes a person engaged in banking
without having special statutory privileges. Section 302,

Stat. 712, § 6; Perkins v. Smith, 116 N. Y. 441. In Musco
v. United Surety Co., 196 N. Y. 459, there was no discriminatiofn within the same class.
Hostile discriminations against any class as singled
out by this act; has been repeatedly -condemned by this
court. Pembina Min. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 125 U. S. 181;

Circumstances and conditions that led to the enactment
of the law cannot be considered on the question as to the
constitutionality of the law. Doyle v. Cont.' Ins. Co., 94

Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122.

ENGEL v. O'MALLtEY.
219 U. S.

Argument for Appell e.

The statute is violative of the commerce clause of the
Constitution because it attempts to regulate interstate
and foreign commerce. Mobile County v. Kimball, 102
U. S. 691, 702; Pomeroy on Const. Law, § 378; Cooley on
Const. Law, 7th ed., 688; Leis8y v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100;
Wabash & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U. S. 557.
The statute in this case not only attempts to regulate
interstate commerce, but it imposes a tax by way of a
license fee as a condition for carrying on the business
of transmitting moneys to foreign countries. Brown v.
Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S.

The public nature of the banking business has been
recognized, and the duty exists on the part of the State to
protect those dealing with banks and bankers. New York
Banking Law, §§ 14, 76; People v. Provident Assn., 161
N. Y. 492; New York Ins. Law, §§ 13-17; New York Liquor
Tax Law, § 16; General Corporation Law, § 22.
There is no merit in the attack on this legislation based
on the claims that the right to a license depends on five
years' residence in the United States and that the Comptroller is vested with discretionary power with respect to
the granting of licenses; but complainant being a citizen
who has carried on business in the State of New York
for upwards of twenty years, cannot raise this question.

The provision in the act, to the effect that, after notice
of application for a license has been posted, the Comptroller may, in his discretion, approve or disapprove the
application, does not confer the arbitrary power of rejection. The discretion conferred is a legal discretion, which
must be reasonable. Cases supra.
Discretionary power may be vested in administrative
boards, Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U. S. 92; 2 Willoughby.

The act does not deprive the complainant and those
similarly situated of the equal protection of the law. The
exceptions contained therein constitute a legitimate exercise of the right of Classification. All persons coming
within the class to which the complainant belongs are
accorded like treatment, and there is no discrimination
among the members of any of the classes affected.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill in equity to prevent the carrying out of
Chapter 348 of the Laws of New York for 1910, which
forbids individuals or partnerships to engage in the business of receiving deposits of money for safe keeping or for
the purpose of transmission to another or for any other
purpose without a license from the Comptroller. The requirements for obtaining the license, so far as they affect
the plaintiff, are that the applicant shall deposit ten thousand dollars with the Comptroller and present a bondwith
a penalty of not more than fifty thousand or less than ten
thousand dollars, to be fixed by the Comptroller, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties undertaken. After notice shall have been posted for two weeks
the Comptroller may approve or disapprove the application in his discretion, and licensees are to pay a fee of fifty
dollars. § 25. The license-is revocable at all times by the
Comptroller for cause shown. § 26. Carrying on, the business specified, or using the word 'banking' or 'banker'
on signs, letterheads or advertisements in connection with
any business, without a license, is made a misdemeanor.
§ 27. The foregoing provisions do not apply to any corporation or 'individual banker' authorized to do business
under the banking law, or to national banks; to any hotel
keeper who shall receive money for safe-keeping from a

guest; to any express 'or telegraph company receiving
money for transmission; to individuals or partnerships
where the average amount of each sum received on deposit or for transmission in the ordinary course of business
shall have been not less than five hundred dollars during
the fiscal year preceding an affidavit to that effect; or,
finally, to any individual or partnership filing a bond approved by the Cpmptroller for one hundred thousand dollars when the business is in a city having a million inhabitants, or, if elsewhere, for fifty thousand 'dollars; or
money, or securities that the Comptroller approves. § 29d.
The plaintiff alleges that he is a citizen of the United
States and has been engaged in the business specified in
the statute for twenty years; that by good reputation and
considerable expenditure he has made his business of great
value, and that it chiefly consists in receiving deposits in
very small sums from time to time until they reach an
amount sufficient to be sent to other States and mainly to
foreign countries. The plaintiff further alleges that he
has not the means that would enable him to make the
deposit and give the bond required, and that the enforcement of the law against him will compel him to close. He
avers that the statute is unconstitutional as against him
under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the commerce clause of the Constitution of. the United States.
Article I, § 8. The bill was demurred to and the demurrer
was sustained by the Circuit Court.
The first objection urged by the plaintiff in argument
is to a requirement that we have riot mentioned, that the
applicant must have been continuously for five years immediately preceding his application a resident of the
United States. As the plaintiff alleges that he satisfies
this requirement, he'has nothing to complain of. And
therefore, without intimating any doubt as to the validity
of the clause, we pass at once to the matters in which he
is concerned. Southern Ry. Co. v. King, 217 U. S. 524,

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

219 U. S.

534. As a preliminary to his argument the plaintiff denies
that he is in any sense a banker, and even goes so far as to
treat the receipt of money for safe keeping or transmission
within the meaning of the act as a case of bailment in
which the very coins received must be returned or sent on.
Of course this is not a true construction of the statute, as
is sufficiently indicated by the title "Private Banking."
The receipt of money by a bank, although it only creates a
debt, is in a popular sense the receipt of money for safe
keeping, since the depositor can draw it out again at such
time and in such sums as he chooses. It is safe to assume
that the transmission of money contemplated very generally is accomplished by a draft, and practically never by
sending on the identical currency received. One form at
least of the business aimed at and, on the face of the bil!,
that carried on by the' plaintiff, is a branch of the banking business. Furthermore, it is a business largely done
with poor and ignorant immigrants, especially on their
first arrival here.
We presume that the money deposited with the plaintiff is not'drawn upon by checks, so that a part of the argument in Noble State Bank v. Haskell, just decided, aite,
p. 104, may not apply. On the other hand, experience has
shown that the protection of such depositors against
fraud, which is the purpose running through the statute
is especially needed by at least that class of them 'with
whom the persons hit by the statute largely deal. The
case cited establishes that the State may regulate that
business and may take strong measures to render it secure.
It also establishes that the plaintiff has no such constitutional right to carry it on at will as to raise him above
state laws not manifestly unfit to accomplish the supposed
end, greatly in excess of the need, or arbitrary and capricious in discrimination. The quasi-paternal relations
shown in argument and by documents to exist between
those following the plaintiff's calling and newly-arrived

Opinion of the Court.

immigrants justifies a supervision more paternal than is
needed in ordinary affairs. Whether the court thinks
them wise or not such laws are within the scope of the
discretion which belongs to legislatures and which it is
usual for them to exert.
This appeal seems to have been taken upon the notion
that the plaintiff had a business which, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the State could not touch. But although cut off from that broad proposition, his counsel
presents other more specific objections to the act with
earnestness and force. It is said that even if the plaintiff
could furnish the money and bond required, the Comptroller might refuse a license upon his arbitrary whim.
No guides are given in §,25 for the discretion that he is to
exercise, and a provision in § 29e that nothing in the article
shall be construed to require the Comptroller to make any
inquiry as to the solvency of any applicant is thought to
exclude solvency as the test and to leave the matter at sea.
We do not so understand the puijose and purport of
§ 29e, and should suppose that the discretion to be exercised in the refusal to grant the license under § 25 was
similar to that exercised under § 26 in revoking one; and
that in each case the Comptroller was expected to act for
cause. But the nature and extent of the remedy, if any,
for a breach of duty on his part we think it unnecessary to
consider; for the power of the State to make the pursuit of
a calling dependent upon obtaining a license is well established, where safety seems to require it, and what we have
said before sufficiently indicates that this calling is one to
which the requirement may be attached. See Gundling
v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183. Lieberman v. Van de Carr, 199
U. S. 552.
,Again, it is argued that the statute makes unconstitutional discriminations by excepting the classes mentioned
in § 29d above, especially those in whose business the
average amount of each sum received is not less than $500

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

and those who give a bond of $100,000 or $50,000. But
the former of these exceptions has the manifest purpose
to confine the law as nearly as may be to the class thought
by the legislature to need protection, and the latter merely
substitutes a different form of security, as it well may.
"Legislation which regulates business may well make distinctions depend upon the degree of evil." Heath & Milligan Mfg.: Co., v. Worst, 207 U. S. 338, 355, 356. It is
true, no doubt, that where size is not an index to an admitted evil the law cannot discriminate between the great
and small. But in this case size is an index. Where the
average amount of each sum received is not less than five
hundred dollars we know that we have not before us the
class of ignorant and helpless depositors, largely foreign,
whom the law seeks to protect. See Musco v. United
Surety Co., 196 N. Y. 459, 465. McLean v. Arkansas, 211
U. S.539, 551.
We come to the final objection that this statute is an
attempt to regulate commerce with other States. When,
as in this matter, the Constitution takes from the States
only a portion of their otherwise absolute control, there
may be expected difficulties in drawing the dividing line,
because where it shall be put is a question of more or less.
The trouble is inherent in the situation, but it is the same
in kind that meets us everywhere else in the law. -The
question iswhether the state law creates a direct burden
upon what it is for Congress to control, and the facts of
the specific case must be weighed. In doing so we recur to
what we have said above, that we cannot regard the statement of the plaintiff's business in his bill as describing the
receipt of bailments for the transmission of the identical
objects received to other States. Neither do We regard the
law as having had such. bailments primarily in mind.
Under the statement in the bill and the words of. the
law, we must -take it that the money received even when
received for transmission becomes the money of the de-

Opinion of the Court.

positary and his obligation that of a debtor under contract to pay as may be directed. Presumably the depositor retains the right to call for his money himself or to
change any direction that may have been given, until the
money has left the 'private banker's' hands. The law,
as was said of a similar one by the New York Court of
Appeals, was passed for the purpose of regulating and
safeguarding the business of receiving deposits, which
precedes and is not to be confounded with the later transmission of money, although leading to it. Musco v. United
Surety Co., 196 N. Y. 459, 466, 467. The fact that it is
very likely to lead to it does not change the result. Diamond Glue Co. v. United States Glue Co., 187 U. S. 611, 616.
The case is similar in principle to Ware & Leland V. Mobile
County, 209 U. S. 405, where the nearest cases on the other
side are distinguished. See further Williams v. Fears, 179
.. -_.270., We are of opinion that the commerce clause of
the Constitution is not infringed, and on the whole case
that the decree of the Circuit Court was right.
Decree affirmed.
