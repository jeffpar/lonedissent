SHALLENBERGER, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE
OF NEBRASKA, v. FIRST STATE BANK OF
HOLSTEIN, NEBRASKA.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA.
No. 445.

Argued December 8, 1910.-Decided January 3, 1911.'

Following, and on the authority of, Noble State Bank v. Haskell, ante,
p. 104, sustaining the Bank Depositors' Guaranty Fund Acts of
Oklahoma, held that a similar act of Nebraska, providing for a
guaranty fund and prohibiting banking except by corporations
formed under the act, is not unconstitutional.
172 Fed. Rep.-999, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of the
banking act of Nebraska, creating a depositors' guaranty
fund, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Arthur F. Mullen, Attorney General of the State of
Nebraska, Mr. Charles 0. Whedon and Mr. I. L. Albert,
with whom Mr. Grant G. Martin was on the brief, for appellants: 1

common right, a right lawfully exercisable only under a
franchise granted by the State. Mercantile NationalBank

Nebraska, 1895; § 16, art. 1, Const. Nebraska; § 1, art.
XIb, Const. Nebraska.
The act is not an abuse of the power of the State to
regulate and control the business of banking. Every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute,
and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a
rational doubt. Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 718; Powell
v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678.
While legislation having for its object the regulation of
a lawful business must be reasonable, and not unnecessarily oppressive, Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 137, a
large discretion is vested in the legislature to determine its
reasonableness and adaptation to the end sought. Gundling v. Chicago, 177 U. S. 183; Barbier v. Connolly, 113
U. S. 27; Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1; State v. Crittenden,

42 Minnesota, 129; Logan v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., 157
Fed. Rep. 570; Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606.
For the extent to which private rights may be invaded,
where the public good demands, see Offteld v. N. Y., N.H. &
H. R. R. Co., 203 U. S. 375; Railway Co. v. Humes, 115 U. S.
514.; Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97; Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678, 686; C., B.'& Q. Ry. Co. v. Drainage Commissioners, 200 U. S. 561. Banking is a business
sui generis. It is the only business that thrives on its liabilities, payable on demadnd, and whose solvency at all
times depends upon, tihe chance that comparatively feW of

such liabilities will be presented for payment on any one
day.
A banking regulation, therefore, that should not have
among its objects the prevention of the involuntary closing of a bank would be obviously defective.
The provision restricting banking corporations and those
providing for the guaranty of deposits are not so manifestly and unnecessarily arbitrary, unjust or oppressive
that reasonable minds cannot differ with respect to them
and therefore the act is constitutional. Weed v. Berge,
124 N. Y. 664; Meyers v. Irwin, 2 S. & R. 367, 372; Com-nonwealth v. Vrooman, 30 Atl. Rep. 217; Brady v. Mattern,
125 Iowa, 158. State v. Scougal, 3 S. Dak. 55, contra, is not
a controlling authority.
The guaranty feature of the act is not a tax levied
against banks, for the benefit of private individuals. The
act has for its object, not revenue, but regulation. The
guaranty feature is subsidiary to the real purpose of the
act to protect the public against the disastrous consequences of bank failures. Coster v. Tidewater Co., 18 N.
J. Eq. 518, 523; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 26;
.Adams Express Co. v. State, 160 Indiana, 346.
The fact that the law operates to the direct advantage
of depositors, does not invalidate it. Cooley v. Board of
Wardens, 12 How. 298; Town of Wilton v. Town of Weston,
48 Connecticut, 325. The effect of the act in these cases
was to apparently take the property of one man for the
benefit of another. The court sustained the laws. See

People, 46 Michigan, 183; Holst v. Row, 39 Ohio St. 340;

In 1829, the legislature of New York enacted a guaranty

Mr. John Lee Webster, with whom Mr. William V.
Allen was on the brief, for appellees:
The guaranty deposit law is unconstitutional and void.
It deprives copartnerships, firms and individuals of their
natural, inherent and vested right to continue their existing, established and chartered banking business, and subjects them to penalties. Their property may be seized and
their business closed ouf by a receivership if they attempt
to continue the banking business. Bank of California v.

American L. & T. Co., 65 N. W. Rep. 78.
The statute does more than simply prohibit private
banking, it winds up the affairs of existing private banks
If they continue business through the agency of a c6'i .ration it is conditioned that they shall agree that a part of
their property shall be taken to pay the private debts of
other banks.
The State does not possess the right to compel a citizen
to accept of a corporate charter, nor can it compel him
to become a member of a corporation. Slaughter House

Marx, 99 N. Y. 377; Wyeth v; Cambridge Board of Health,
200 Massachusetts, 474.
A statute is unconstitutional which limits the right of a
citizen to become a member of a copartnership. Schnaier
v. Navarre Hotel Co., 182 N. Y. 83; and see People v.
Ringe, 197 N. Y. 143. The State cannot compel private
bankers to inoorporate. The formation of corporations
must be the voluntary act of the parties. Cook on Corps.,
4th ed., § 2a; I Thompson on, Corp., § 52; Dartmouth
College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518.
The guaranty feature of the law is an arbitrary and
capricious exercise of power. It takes the assets of solvent, banks without compensation and appropriates the
same to the payment of the private debts of insolvent
banks in violation of § 10 of Art. I, and § 1 of Art. XIV of
the Constitution of the United States and in violation of
§§ 3 and 16 of Art. I of the constitution of Nebraska.
The taking of the assets of one bank to pay the claims
of depositors of another bank is taking property for a
private use without due process of law, and without compensation. Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655.;
Cole v. LaGrange, 113 U. S. 1; Parkersburgv. Brown, 106,
U. 'S. 487; State v. Osawkee, 14 Kansas, 418; Lowell v.

State v. Froelich, 118 Wisconsin, 129; Deering v. Peterson,
,75 Minnesota, 118. The guaranty fund provision of the
act is a phase of paternalism that is obnoxious to our
system of government.
The suggestion in appellants' brief that the taking of
the money from one bank to pay the debts of another

bank to its depositors is not the taking of money for a
private use, is untenable. The relation between the bank
and the depositor is that of debtor and creditor. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518; Bank of the
United States v. Planters' Bank, 9' Wheat. 904, 907;
Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11. Pet. 257, 324; Bolton v.
White, 2 Cr. C. C. 426; Rundle v. Del. & R. Canal, 1 Wall.
275; State Bank v. Knoop, 16 How. 369.
Taking the money from the banks by the process of the
Guaranty Fund to pay the depositors of another bank is
an appropriation of the money to a private use and not
for a public use. Loan Assn. v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655;
Reagan v. Farmers' L. & T. Co., 154 U. S. 362, 399; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., 183 U. S. 79, 8".
The guaranty provision of the new banking act is not
within the scope of the police powers of the State. The
police power has its limitations. The police power cannot
justify the invasion of any property or contracc rght of
the citizen granted to him under the Constitution. Con-

nolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540; Dobbins v.
Los Angeles, 195 U. S. 223, 237; Gulf, Colo. & S. F. Ry. Co.
v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150; Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313;'
Lake Shore Ry. Co. v. Smith, 173 U. S. 684; Colon v. Lisk,
153 N. Y. 188.
The police power is the law of necessity, which means
more than expediency, and no necessity exists for the
Nebraska Bank Guaranty Law. The exercise of the police

power must stop short of infringing constitutional rights.
Cases cited supra, and Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Murphey, 196 U. S. 194, 206; Richey v. People, 155 Illinois, 98,

187 N. Y. 90, 94; State v. Goodwill, 33 W. Va. 179.
Whether a statute is within or without a proper exercise of the police power is a question always subject to
final determination by the coprts. Cases supra and' Jew

The principle which underlies the bank guaranty deposit laws, when carried to its ultimate legitimate result,
means unrestrained socialism in state government.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit b' many banks to prevent the Banking
Board of Nebraska from carrying out and enforcing an act
similar to the Oklahoma statute just passed upon. It forbids banking except by a corporation formed under the
act and provides for a guaranty fund. The Circuit Court
held the statute unconstitutional and issued an injunction
against the enforcement of it. 172 Fed. Rep. 999. For
the reasons given in the foregoing case the decree of the
Circuit Court must be reversed.
Decree reversed.
