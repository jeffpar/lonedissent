TITLE GUARANTY & TRUST COMPANY OF
SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, v. CRANE COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOIU THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 67.

Argued December 6, 7, 1910.-Decided December 19, 1910.

A vessel being constructed under contract for the United States is a
public work within the meaning of the act of August 13, 1894, c. 280,
28 Stat. 278, as amended by the act of February 24, 1905, c. 778,
33 Stat. 811, and materialmen can maintain an action on the bond
given pursuant to such statute by the contractor.
Whether a work is public or not, depends on whetheir it belongs to the
representative of the public and not on whether it is or is not attached to the soil.
Where title to the completed portion of a vessel being constructed for
the United States passes to the United States as payments are made,
laborers and materialmen cannot assert liens under the state law,
but can maintain actions on the contractor's bond given under the
act of 1894 as amended by the act of 1905. United States v. Ansonia
Brass & Copper Co., 218 U. S.452.
The court will, in the absence of clear and established construction,
reach its own conclusion in construing a statute, notwithstanding
opinions of the Attorney General looking in the opposite direction.
Held, in this case, that the suit had been properly brought, and that
the United States was not necessarily a party, the suit being begun
in the name of the United States to the real plaintiff's use.
Although the plaintiff may not have applied for copy of the bond and
filed an affidavit that the labor and materials had been supplied, the
defect was formal and not vital as the intervenors had complied with
the statute in that respect.
Objections to allowing claimants the benefit of the bond given by the
contractor under the act of 1894 as amended by the act of 1905,
either because they had a lien or because the service was too remote, if carried to an extreme, would defeat the purpose of the act.
Where a bond is under seal consideration is presumed; in this case,
although the bond was not executed until ten days after execution

of the contract which it was given to secure, the transactions may be
regarded as simultaneous.
Assignments of claims of materialmen on a public work held in this
case not to have affected the remedy of .enforcing the same against
the surety on the contractor's bond.
In a suit to enforce claims of materialmen against surety on a contractor's bond, each claimant is entitled to a docket fee of $10.00.
Although the claims are consolidated in a single suit the causes of
action are distinct.
163 Fed. Rep. 168, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of the materialmen's act of August 13, 1894, as amended by the act
of February 24, 1905, axe stated in the opinion.
Mr. James B. Murphy, with whom Mr. C. H. Winders
and Mr. M. M. Richardson were on the brief, for plaintiff
in error:
The purpose of Congress in the passage of the act of
August 13, 1894, 28 Stat. 278, as amended February 24,
1905, 33 Stat. 811, was to protect, first, the United States,
and, second, to protect laborers and materialmen, who
had no right of lien by reason of the building or work being
upon the property of or belonging to the sovereign, by
giving to them a right of action on the contractor's bond,
substituting the bond for the building or public work. Hill

TITLE GUARANTY & TRUST CO. v. CRANE CO. 31
219 U.-S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action brought under the Act of August 13,
1894, c.280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended by the Act of February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811, upon a bond given to
the United States as required by that act. The contract
to secure which the bond was given was a contract by the
Puget Sound Engine Works to build and deliver a single
screw wooden steamer for the United States, and the main
question in the case is whether the statute applies to a
contract for such a chattel. If not, parties like the-plaintiffs, who furnished labor or materials for the work, have
no standing to maintain the suit. We proceed, as soon as
•may be, to dispose of that question, leaving details and
minor objections to be taken up later in turn. It was
raised by demurrer to the declaration and subsequently
by what was entitled an affirmative defence pleaded by
the surety and a demurrer by the plaintiffs. The decision
was for the plaintiffs against the surety in the Circuit
Court of Appeals. 163 Fed. Rep. 168; S. C., 89 C. C. A.
618.
The amended statute requires any person "entering
into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and
completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any
public building or public work," "to execute the usual
penal bond . . . with the additional obligation that
such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and
materials in the prosecution of the work." It gives any
person who has furnished. labor or materials used in the
construction or repair of any public work, which have not
been paid. for, the right to intervene in a suit upon the
bond. In short, besides securing the United States, the
.act is intended to protect persons furnishing materials or
labor "for the construction of public works," as the title

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

219 U. S.

declares. The question narrows itself. accordingly to
whether the steamer was 'a public work' within the meaning of the words as used.
As a preliminary to the answer it is relevant to mention
that by Article 3 of the contract partial payments are provided for as the "labor and material furnished" equal certain percentages of the total, and that by Article 4 "the
portion of the vessel completed and paid for under said
method of partial payments shall become the property of
the United States," although the contractor remains responsible for the care of the portion paid for, and by
Article 2 there is to be a final test of the vessel when completed. The vessel has been built and accepted, and is
now in possession of the United States. Notwithstanding
these facts, it was argued that the statute did not apply to
the contract, because the laborers and materialmen had a
lien by the state law; and that, even if the statute applied,
they had lost their rights by not asserting them before
the delivery of the vessel, as before that, it is said, the title
did not pass to the United States. Among other things
this ended the right to subrogation that the surety might
have claimed. But the very recent decision in United
States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 218 U. S. 452, establishes that the title to the completed portion of the
vessel passed, as provided in Article 4, and that the laborers and materialmen could not have asserted the lien
supposed to exist.
The case cited shows therefore that such claimants are
within the policy of the statute. It also contains a strong
intimation that they are within the meaning of its words.
For it refers to the statute and says that it was in recogni-

tion of the inability of such persons to take liens upon the
public property of the United States that Congress passed
the act, and adds that in view of this purpose to provide
protection for those who could not protect themselves the
statute has been given liberal construction by this court.

TITLE GUARANTY & TRUST CO. v. CRANE CO. 33
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

See also Hill v. American Surety Co., 200 U. S. 197. The
reference and comment when the attempt was made to
enforce a lien under state laws would have had no relevance unless they had been intended to point out the true
remedy available in such a case. The argument that the
vessel was not a public work loses most of its force when
it appears that the title was in the United States as soon
as the first payment was made. Of course public works
usually are of a permanent nature and that fact leads to a
certain degree of association between the notion of permanence and the phrase. But- the association is only empirical, not one of logic. Whether a work is public or not'
does not depend upon its being attached to the soil; if it
belongs to the representative of the public it is public, and
we do not think that the arbitrary association that we
have mentioned amounts to a coalescence of the more
limited idea with speech, so absolute that we are bound
to read 'any public work' as confined to work on land
It is not necessary to discuss in detail some opinions from
the Attorney General's office in cases where the title to the
vessel did not pass that looked rather in the opposite direction. It is enough to say that there has been no such
clear and established construction as to cause us to yield
our own view. On the other hand, the decision of some
other courts has been in accord with the judgment below
and with what we now decide. United States v. Perth
Amboy Shipbuilding & Engineering Co., 137 Fed. Rep.
689, 693. American Surety Co. v. Lawrenceville Cement Co.,
110 Fed. Rep. 717, 719. United States v. zEtna Indem. Co.,
40 Washington, 87.
Another defence, set up in the same manner as the first,
is that the United States should have been made a party,
and, in connection with this, a further one that the suit
cannot be maintained unless the plaintiff has applied, as
provided in the statute, for a copy of the bond, and furnished an affidavit that labor or materials have been supVOL. ccxix-3

plied by him for the prosecution of the work. The latter
is the more substantial, as, of course, the suit was begun
in the name of the United States to the real plaintiffs' use.
But the objection is not serious in .either form. No suit
had been brought by the United States for more than
six months from the completion of the work, affidavits
were made and copies filed by:intervenors, and in the circumstances the omission was only a formal defect. The
language of the statute that after giving the affidavit the
party should be furnished with a certified copy of the contract and bond, "upon which he or they shall have a right
of action," etc., may be read as meaning 'upon which
bond' as easily as 'upon doing which,' and hardly can be
construed as making a condition precedent. The conditions are attached in the form of provisos by later words.
Next it is objected that certain claimants are not entitled to the benefit of the bond, either because they had a
lien or because the service was too remote. Of the former
class are claims for cartage and towage to the spot where
the work was going on. We agree with Judge Putnam in
American Surety Co. v. LawrenceviUle Cement Co., 110 Fed.
Rep. 717, that in these small matters the objection if carried to an extreme would defeat the purpose of the statute, that such liens ordinarily are not insisted upon, and
that it would be unreasonable to let the statute 'interfere
with the convenience of minor dealings in such methods
as the usual practices establish.' Of the other class are
the claims for patterns furnished to the moulding department of the Puget Sound Engine Works. As was said by
-the judge below, those who furnish the patterns have as
fair a claim to be protected as those who erect the scaffolding upon which the carpenters stand in doing their work
upon the ,hip.
Ncxt it is said that the bond was without consideration
because the contract was made on February 17, and the
bond not executed until February 27, ten days later. But

A general classification in a state statute resting upon obvious principles of public policy does not offend the equal protection provision

An employd of a railway company, although not engaged in the actual
operation of trains, is nevertheless within the general line of hazard
inherent in the railway business.
A state statute abrogating the fellow-servant rule as to employes of
railway companies is not unconstitutional under the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment because it applies to
