woull be to -disregard, as the Commission said, the substance of things and make evasions of the act of Congress quite easy. It makes no difference, therefore, that
the' hipments .of the products were not made on through
bills of lading or whether their initial point was Galveston or some -other place in Texas. They were all destined
for export and by their delivery to the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway they must be considered
aA having been delivered to a carrier for transportation
to their foreign destination, the Terminal Company
being a part of the railway for such purpose. The case,
therefore, comes under Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S.517, where
it is said that goods are in interstate, and necessarily as
well in foreign, commerce when they have "actually
started in the course of transportation to another State,
or deli vwed to a carrier for transportation." In G., C. &

MERRIMACK RIVER SAVINGS BANK v. CITY OF
CLAY CENTER.
IN RE PROCEEDINGS FOR CONTEMPT.

No. 604. Argued January 26, 1911.-Decided February 20, 1911.
The force and effect of a decree dismissing a bill and discharging an injunction is neither suspended nor annulled as a mere consequence
of an appeal to this court, even if supersedeas is allowed; but the
Circuit Court.has power to continue an injunction during such an
appeal by virtue of its inherent equity power. Equity Rule 93.
While the (ircuit Court has not only the power to continue an in-.
junction in order to preserve the 8tatus quo pending an appeal but to
take cognizance of violations of such injunction, it does not follow

that violating the injunction is not a contempt also of the appellate
jurisdiction of this court and that question is not now decided.
Irrespective of an actual injunction order, the willful destruction or
removal beyond the reach of this court of the subject-matter of litigation pending an appeal to this court is a contempt of the appellate jurisdiction of this court; and this is so even though it may also
be a violation of the injunction below.
An appeal to this court must be regarded as pending and undisposed
of until the mandate issues, even though a decision may hav been
announced. Defendants under order to show cause why they
should not be punished for contempt for having, after decision in
their favor but before mandate, destroyed the subject-matter of the
litigation, are adjudged in teohnical contempt; but having under
oath denied any intent of contempt and satisfied the court of their
good faith, the vindication of the court is satisfied by discharging
the rule on payment of costs.

THE facts, which involve questions of contempt for
violation of injunction after decision of this court and
before issuing of the mandate, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. F. L. Williams, with whom Mr. D. R. Hite and Mr.
C. C. Coleman, were on the brief, for petitioner:
This court is possessed Of. the power to so deal with the
property as to make its final decision and judgment effectual. This court and not the Circuit Court is the tribunal clothed with authority to maintain the status of
the parties existing at the time an appeal is taken and
thereby rendering, it possible for its judgment and mandate to become effectual. Penn. R. R. Co. v. National

Dowell v. Applegate, 152 U.-S. 327.
The Circuit Court having passed upon the question
before it and a right of appeal'being given from its decision,
neither the Circuit Court nor the parties had any right

to determine any question concerning this matter until
the judgment and mandate of this court had been taken.
This Court is not without jurisdiction to punish respondents for a violation of the injunctional order because
such jurisdiction is in the Circuit Court which issued the
5rder. 'State v. Bridge Co., 16 W. Va. 864; Gates v. Mc.Danid,4 Stew. & P. (Ala.) 69, distinguished, and see

Even if the case is one which the court in which it is
pending eventually determines that there is want of jurisdiction, the injunctional orders of the court are not
therefore void. Williamson's Case, 26 Pa. St. 9, 21; Ex

This court has the power and authority to maintain
the status of the property pending the litigation, even
though jurisdiction may eventually be denied. United
States v. Shipp, 203 U. S. 563, 573.
It is contempt of the court in which an action is pending for a litigant to destroy, remove, or conceal the subject of the litigation, or do any other act in respect to
the subject of the litigation, which may render nugatory
the decision of the court. In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 598;

No order of any kind or character ,has ever been entered or made by this court, save and except an order
made on October 24, 1910, dismissing the appeal for want
of jurisdiction. This must mean that, according to the
unbroken line of authorities, jurisdiction remains in the
court below to punish for any infraction or violation of
the orders of that court, and it follows as a necessary consequence that these parties cannot be found guilty of
contempt of this court. The sole power to, punish for.
contempt by a Federal court will be found in § 725 of the
Judiciary Act. All proceedings in contempt in Federal
courts are criminal in their nature and governed largely
by the rules of criminal law and -criminal procedure. See.

Even if it was within the power of this court to punish
parties for disobeying an Qrder granted by the court below, fines for the benefit of parties could not be inflicted
at this time because if the case is ever heard on its merits
it may turn out to be that the plaintiff in the case had no
right to have its poles and wires upon the streets of the
city. Punishment of a civil nature for' the benefit of the
parties cannot be inflicted until after the merits of the
case have been passed upon. If such a penalty should be
adjudged prior to the hearing on the merits on which the
court should find the parties had a right to do the acts
complained of and, the other parties had no rights, the
judgment punishing for'the benefits of the parties would
necessarily have to be set aside. Besette v. Conkey, 194

MR.

JUSTICE

LURTON delivered the opinion of the court.

The Merrimack River Savings Bank' filed a bill in
eqliity in the Circuit Court of the United: States for the
District of Kansas claiming to be a credit6r of the light
and power company by bonds secured by mortgage upon
its plant, property .and franchises, against the city of
Clay Center, the Clay Center Light and Power Company
and certain individuals, officials of said city. The bill
averred that the Clay Center Light and Power Company
was a corporation owning and conducting a light and
power plant at Clay Center under a perpetual franchise,
authorizing it to place and maintain a line of poles and
wires.upon the streets of that city; that thecity, claiming that its franchise h-ad expired, had, through its coun-

Opinion of the Court.

cil, of which the individual defendants were members,'
required said -company to remove its poles and wires
from the public streets, and that the officials named as
defbndants were threatening to cut down its .poles and
destroy its wires thereon, and thus destroy all possibility
of operating its plant, to the irreparable ruin of the security to which the complainant must look' for the payment of its bonds. A temporary injunction was issued
to prevent the destruction of the lines of poles and wires
as threatened. A demurrer to the bill for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court as a court of the United States
was sustained and the bill dismissed. An appeal to this
court was allowed and the injunction continued pending
the appeal. Upon a hearing in this court the appeal was
dismissed without opinion.
The present petition alleges that after this court had
made an order dismissing said appeal, but before any
mandate had issued or could issue under the rules of this
court, and pending the right of petitioners to file an application for a rehearing, since filed and now pending, certain of the defendants to said appeal, namely, George W.
Hanna, 0. L. Slade, W. D. Vincent, S. D. Tripp, and
G. P. Randall, had, by force and violence, cut.down many
of the poles and destroyed much of the cable and wires
stretched thereon, and had put the light and power company out of business and disabled it so that it could not
exercise its franchise or carry on its operations. It is
averred that the said defendants did thus destroy the
subject-matter of the suit, knowing that this appeal was
pending and that this court had not lost control over
the controversy, and that no mandate had issued and
could not issue under the rules. The petition concludes
by praying that the individual defendants named be
,cited and required to appear before this court and "show
cause, if any they have, why they should not be proceeded against as for contempt of this court." Such a

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

rule was made, and the defendants have appeared and
made defense.
The respondents have moved to discharge the rule,
because the petition fails to show that they have in any
way violated any injunction, rule, order or mandate of
this court. This is bottomed, first, upon the claim that
the injunction which was continued pending the appeal
to this court is the injunction of the Circuit Court, and
that any violation is cognizable only in the Circuit Court,
and second, upon the claim that if that be so, that the
petition fails to show any facts which constitute a contempt of this court.
The plain purpose of the order continuing the injunction pending this appeal was to preserve the subjectmatter of the litigation until the rights of the complainant could be heard and decided. It is well settled that
the force and effect of a decree dismissing a bill and discharging an injunction is neither suspended nor annulled
as a mere consequence of an appeal to this court, even if
a supersedeas is allowed. Slaughter-House Cases, 10 Wall.
273, 297; Hovey v. McDonald, 109 U. S. 150, 161; Leonard
v. Ozark Land Co., 115 U. S. 465; Knox County v. Harsh-

man, 132 U. S. 14. That the Circuit Court, to the end
that-the status quo might be preserved pending such appeal, had the power to continue an injunction in force
by virtue of its inherent equity power is not doubtful.
In Hovey v. McDonald, cited abc 'e, Mr. Justice Bradley
for the court, referring to what had been said inthe
Slaughiter-House Cases as to the effect of an appeal,

said:
"It was not decided that the court below had no
power, if the purposes of justice required it, to order a
continuance of the status quo until a decision should be
made by the appellate court, or until that court should
order the contrary. This power undoubtedly exists, and
should always be exercised when any, irremediable injury

MERRIMACK RIVER SAV. BK. v. CLAY CENTER. 535
219 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

may result from the effect of the decree as rendered; but
it is a discretionary power, and its exercise or non-exercise
is not an appealable matter. In recognition of this power
and for the purpose of facilitating its proper exercise in
certain cases, on appeals from the Circuit Courts, this
court, by an additional rule of practice in equity, adopted
in October term, 1878, declared that 'When an appeal
from a final decree, in an equity suit, granting or dissolving an injunction, is allowed by a justice or judge
who took part in the decision of the cause, he may, in
his discretion, at the time of such allowance, make an
order suspending or modifying the injunction during the
pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or
otherwise as he may consider proper for the security of
the rights of the opposite party.' Rule 93."
Obviously this may include a continuance of an injunction which would be otherwise vacated.
Plainly the effect of continuing the injunction operated
to continue in the Circuit Court-such jurisdiction over
the subject-matter of the litigation and of the parties as
to enable it to preserve the status quo pending the appeal,,
including power to take cognizance of a violation of its
injunction.
It does not necessarily follow that disobedience of such
an injunction, intended only to preserve the status quo
pending an appeal, may not be regarded as a contempt
of the appellate jurisdiction of this court, which might
be rendered nugatory by conduct calculated to remove
the Subject-matter of the appeal beyond its control, or
by its destruction. This we need not decide, since irrespective of any such injunction actually issued the willful removal beyond the reach of the court of the subjectmatter of the litigation or its destruction pending an
appeal from a decree praying, among other things, an
injunction to prevent such removal or destruction until
the right shall be detbrmined, is, in and of itself, a con-

tempt of the appellate jurisdiction of this court. That
such conduct may be a violation of the injunction below
affords no reason why it is not also a contempt of this
court. Unless this be so, a reversal, of the decree would
be but a barren victory, since the very result would have
been brought about by the lawless act of the defendants
which it was the object of the suit to prevent.

In Wartman v. Wartman, cited above, a case heard by
Chief Justice Taney on the circuit, the question was
whether a defendant who had parted with an alleged
trust fund in his custody pending an application for an
order requiring him to pay the money into court was
thereby in contempt. His act was held to be in contempt
of the authority of the court, as a final decree would be
idle and nugatory if pending the litigation he should be
held at liberty to put the fund beyond the reach of the
process of the court.
The defendants have severally answered and have
denied under oath that they meant any contempt of
this court. They say that when they were advised that
the decree of the court dismissing the bill of complaint
had been affirmed and an order of affirmance entered,
that they honestly believed .the case to be finally concluded, and that there was no reason why the order of
the city council requiring the removal of the lines of
poles and wires should not be. carried out. This is an
excuse, but does not acquit them of a technical contempt,
since the appeal must be regarded as pending and undisposed of until a mandate issues. In- view, however,
of the good faith of the defendants, it is enough for the

As the Forest Reserve provision of the Sundry Civil Act of June 4,
"1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 36, did not prescribe the mrthod which those
entitled to avail of its provision should pursue, it was. competent for

which this court has already held to be reasonable and valid, and
entitled to respect and obedience. Cosmos Co. V. Gray Eagle il

One not following the rules and regulations adopted by the Land
Department for exchange of lands under the Forest Reserve Act
and not accompanying his relinquishment deed with a proper selection in lieu of the land relinquished, and whose relinquishment was
returned to him by the Department, did not become entitled to a
selection and exchange after the repeal of the act.
Where one attempting to avail of the statutory provision to exchange
under the Forest Reserve Act of 1897 failed to comply with the
rules and regulations of the Land Department, and his relinquishment deed was returned to him, no.contract was created with the
