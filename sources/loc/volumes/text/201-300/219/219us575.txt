NOBLE STATE BANK v. HASKELL.
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE PETITION YOR REHEARING.
No. 71.

Submitted January 27, 1911.-Decided February 20, 1911.

Motion for leave to file petition for rehearing in Noble AState Bank v.
Haskell, ante, p. 104, denied.
Even where powerful arguments can be made against the wisdom of
legislation this court can say nothing, as it is not concerned there-

with.
Among the public uses for which private property may be taken arc
some which, if looked at only in their immediate aspect according to
the approximate effect of the taking, may seem to be private.
Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S. 361; Strickley v. Highland Boy Mining Co.,
200 U.S. 527.
Payments required by a bank guarantee statute which can be avoided
by going out of the banking business, and are required only as a condition for keeping on in such business from corporations created by
the State, do not amount to a taking of private property without
compensation ar a deprivation of property without due process of
law; and so held as to the Oklahoma Bank Guarantee statute heretofore sustained as to its constitutionality, ante, p. 104.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. C. B. Ames for plaintiff in error:
Counsel hardly presum6s to expect this court to reconsider a conclusion reached by unanimous agreement,

but respectfully suggests that the opinion is based on an

219 U. S.

erroneous assumption of fact and on a principle of law not
supported by former decisions.
The erroneous assumption of fact is that the property
taken by the law under consideration is a comparatively
insignificant portion of the bank's capital.
The principle of law referred to is that a portion of the
bank's property may be taken without return to pay
debts of a failing .rival in business.
While the amount of the particular assessment involved in this Case is small when considered alone, it is
large when considered as a percentage of the bank's capital stock, amounting to 3.30/100 per cent, and if this law is
valid, then, of course, similar laws might be passed applicable to all state and national banks. Two per cent of the
deposits in the United States would be over $280,000,000
which is more than fifteen per cent of the total capital
stock.
Even if two per cent may never be levied, still the law
permits the levy. A law which takes eight per cent of the
aggregate capital of all the banks as a preliminary step
towards creating a guaranty fund, which authorizes an
annual taking thereafter of fifteen per cent, ,which, when
applied to aggregates, mounts up into the hundreds of
millions of dollars, cannot be justified as the taking of a
comparatively insignificant portion of the bank's property.
As to the bank's reversionary interest in the unused
portion of the fund, the last message of the Governor of
Oklahoma shows an average loss of approximately two
. per cent per annum on the entire capital and surplus as of
November 10, 1910.
This law not only takes from the banks this enormous
sum of money, but it takes from the banker the value of
his reputation and reduces all bankers, good, bad and
indifferent, to the same level.
The fact that the average annual losses of our national:
banks has been only a small per cent of their deposits is

no argument that the same condition would prevail under a
guarantee law. See addresses delivered by J. W. McNeal
before American Bankers' Association, and by Daniel W.
Hogan before the Nebraska State Bankers' Association in
September, 1908. They illustrate that the conclusion of
law that a portion of the bank's property may be taken
without return to pay debts of a failing rival in business
is unsupported by authority. In Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S.
361; "Sirickleyv. Highland Boy Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527,
531; Offield v. New York, N. H. & H. R. R. Co., 203 U. S.
372; and Bacon v. Walker, 204 U. S. 311, 315, the basis in
each case was that the property was taken for public use.
As to Bacon v. Walker see Sweet v. Valentine, 8 Idaho, 431.
When property is taken for public use the compensation must be in money and not in some so-called general
benefit. Lewis on Em. Dom., 3d ed., §§ 502-505.
The legislature is the exclusive judge of the existence
of an emergency and when one is declared it is binding
.on the courts, Oklahoma City v. Shields, 22 Oklahoma, 265;
S. C., 100 Pac. Rep. 559; In re Menefee, 22 Oklahoma, 365;
97 Pac. Rep. 1014; but the doctrine laid down in the opinion substitutes public opinion for the constitution. Public opinion can only be ascertained from the will of the
people as declared by the legislature, and, therefore, the
decision substitutes the act of the legislature for the constitution. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 341.
The legal objection to such a law would be that it takes
private property for private use. The practical objection
would be that it discourages careful scrutiny in taking
checks, and encourages reckless and incompetent business.
Putting the cost of an examination upon the bank does
not take its property for a private use because the fee
charged goes to the public officers of the State and is for
a public use.
The opinion is in direct conflict with the entire range of
decisions holding that state action imposing a railroad

rate too low to furnish return on the investment is unconstitutional as a taking of private property for private use.
Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113.
There is a twilight zone separating public use from
private use and within this zone the line of division is irregular and here it is that the courts differ from each
other in the application of the principle, but the difficulty
heretofore has been in determining whether the use was
public or private.
When it has once been determined that the property is
being taken for a private use that has heretofore been regarded as the complete settlement of the controversy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

219 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the court.

Leave to file an application for rehearing is asked in
this case. We see no reason to grant it, but, as the judgment delivered, ante, p. 104, seems to have conveyed a
wrong impression of the opinion of the court in some details, we add a few words to what was said when the case
was decided. We fully understand the practical importance of the question and the very powerful argument that
can be made against the wisdom of the legislation, but on
that point we have nothing to say, as it is not our concern.
Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S. 361, Strickley v. Highland Boy
Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527, etc., were cited to establish, not
that property might be taken for a private use, but that
among the public uses for which it might be taken were
some which, if looked at only in their immediate aspect,
according to the proximate effect of the taking, might
seem to be private. This case, in our opinion, is of that
sort. The analysis of the police power, whether correct or
not, was intended to indicate an interpretation of what
has taken place in the past not to give a new or wider
scope to the power. The propositions with regard to it,
however; in any form, are rather in the nature of preliminaries. For in this case there is no out and out unconditional taking at all. The payment can be avoided
by going out of the banking business, and is required only
as a condition for keeping on, from corporations created
by the State. We have given what we deem sufficient
reasons for holding that such a condition may be imposed.
Leave to file petition denied.
