3. The fact that the order of the Commission for the
increase of interstate rates was permissive only does not
affect the validity of its order prescribing minimum intrastate rates. The interstate rates after the addition of the
authorized surcharges were-lawful rates in interstate commerce, which was discriminated against by the failure to
make corresponding increases in intrastate rates. This discrimination the Commission removed in the manner authorized by § 13 (4), by prescribing minimum intrastate
rates at the same level as the interstate rates. The order
precluded any unauthorized interference with state regulatory power by providing that it should be effective only
so long as the surcharges upon interstate rates should be

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 9. Argued October 11, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.
1. Rulings of the court below that, under the circumstances of this
case, a contract of charter, orally arranged by an employee of a
corporate owner, was the personal contract of the owner; and

2. A boat owner who has chartered his boat by his personal contract
of charter can not, under U.S.C., Title 46, §§ 183, 188, 189, limit
his liability for breach of his warranty of seaworthiness, even though
such warranty is not expressed in the contract but is merely implied. P. 88.
3. The warranty of seaworthiness is implied from the circumstances
of the parties and the subject-matter of the contract, and is as
much a part of the contract as any express stipulation. It may
be negatived only by express covenant. P. 88.
4. Inasmuch as the warranty of seaworthiness relates only to the
fitness of the vessel at the commencement of the voyage, and not
to her suitability under conditions thereafter arising which are
beyond the owner's control, the denial of limitation of liability
in cases where the owner by his personal contract warrants seaworthiness does not cut away'the protection afforded to ship owners
by 'the Acts of Congress. P. 88.

CERTIORARI, 289 U.S. 717, to review a judgment affirming a decree of the district court, 45 F. (2d) 859, denying
limitation of liability in admiralty.

Mr. Horace L. Cheyney for petitioner.
The decision below gives rise to a most anomalous situation. If a shipowner in New York City there receives
cargo and personally issues a bill of lading, he can not
limit liability. On the other hand, if the master of the
vessel signs the bill, the owner can limit liability. Furthermore, if cargo is shipped on board a vessel in New
York Harbor under a through bill of lading from the West,
the owner can still limit liability because he has made no
personal contract. It is inconceivable that Congress, in
passing the Limited Liability Law, ostensibly for the encouragement of American shipping, intended such -results.
Pendleton v. Benner Line, 246 U.S. 353, denied the right
to limit liability because the owner had entered into a
personal contract containing an express warranty of seaworthiness. This Court has never held this of an implied
warranty imputed by law.

OOTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

Under the Act of 1851, the right to limit liability depends upon whether or not the loss is with the privity
and knowledge of the vessel owner. The sole effect of
the Act of 1884 was to enlarge the scope of the limitation
laws and to permit the vessel owner to limit liability
against claims not included within the provisions of the
earlier Act. Gokey v. Fort, 44 Fed. 364; Richardson v.
Harmon, 222 U.S. 96; Great Lakes Towing Co. v. Mills
TransportationCo., 155 Fed. 11.
There is conflict in the decisions of the Circuit Courts
of Appeals on the question of the right of the owner to
limit liability where he has made a personal contract.
Second Circuit: The Republic, 61 Fed. 109; The Tommy,
151 Fed. 570; The Loyal, 204 Fed. 930; The Ice King,
261 Fed. 897; Cranford-Cumberland,1927 A.M.C. 1615;
The Soerstad, 257 Fed. 130. Third Circuit: The City of
Camden, 292 Fed. 93; Tucker Stevedoring Co. v. Southwark Mfg. Co., 24 F. (2d) 410. First Circuit: Quinlan v.
Pew, 56 Fed. 111. Fourth Circuit: Pocomoke Guano
Co. v. Eastern Transportation Co., 285 Fed. 7; Wessel
Duval & Co. v. Charleston Lighterage & Transfer Co., 25
F. (2d) 126. Sixth Circuit: Great Lakes Towing Co. v.
Mills TransportationCo., 155 Fed. 11.
The Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, apparently
disregarding its preceding decision in The Ice King, 261
Fed. 897, and the admonition of this Court in Capitol
TransportationCo. v. Cambria.Steel Co., 249 U.S. 334, has
gone back to the decision in The Loyal, 204 Fed. 930.
In the Pendleton case (which was followed in Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., 248 U.S. 139), and in Capitol
TransportationCo. v. Cambria Steel Co., 249 U.S. 334, it
was contended that the right of the vessel owners to limit
liability was fixed by the Act of 1884, and that that Act
repealed the Act of 1851. We contend that the Act of
1884 did not repeal the Act of 1851, and that the right of
the petitioner here is to be determined by the provisions
of the latter Act.

CULLEN FUEL CO. v. HEDGER CO.
82

Argument for Petitionet.

Under that Act the right of the owner to limit liability
for cargo losses depends upon whether the loss occurs with,
his privity or knowledge and not upon whether he had
made a personal contract for the carriage of the goods.
Where there is no express warranty, this so-called implied warranty is not a part of the contract but is only a
result or condition which follows from the relations which
the parties have created for themselves by the contract.
Steel v. State Line S.S. Co., 3 A.C. 86.
The petitioner made no contract, personal or otherwise,
for the carriage of the cargo. The charter was a demise
whereby the charterer became. the owner pro hac vice of
the boat. Monk v. Cornell Steamboat Co., 198 Fed. 472;
The Willie, 231 Fed. 865; Dailey v. Carroll, 248 Fed. 466.
Petitioner warranted the seaworthiness of the barge to
Hedger; but that warranty was only as to the seaworthiness of the boat at the time of its delivery and was not
continuous. The Ice King, 261 Fed. 897; O'Boyle v.
United State8, 47 F. (2d) 585.
There was no implied warranty of the seaworthiness of
the boat by Cullen, its owner, to the owner of the cargo;
but Hedger, the charterer and carrier, did impliedly warrant the. seaworthiness of the boat to the cargo-owner
under the contract of carriage.
The liability in the case of a chartered vessel extends
only to the vessel itself, and the owner is not personally
bound for the performance of the contract of carriage
made by the charterer. Taylor Bros. Co. v. Sunset Lighterage Co., 43 F. (2d) 700.
If the bailee merely sued on behalf of the cargo-owner
or its underwriters the vessel was entitled to limit liability.
The charterer, as bailee of the cargo, has no higher rights
than the cargo-owner.
The court below has denied the right of the petitioner
to limit liability because it made a personal contract, notwithstanding it had never made any contract, personal or

otherwise, for the carriage of the cargo and had no contractual relations whatsoever with the cargo-owner.
Hedger filed his claim merely as bailee of cargo. He
made no claim to recover on account of his liability over,
and it is not shown that he was liable over.
The boat-owner is entitled to limit liability because the
contract of charter was not made by any of its managing
officers but by an employee.
Mr. Thomas H. Middleton, with whom Mr. Forrest E.
Single was on the brief, for respondent.
A corporation can act only through its agents, but if a
corporation gives its marine superintendent authority to
charter its boat, the charters are no less personal con-,
tracts of the corporation than they would be if entered into
by its president or other authorized officer.

The test of

"personal contract " is not the name of the officer but his
authority to bind the corporation. Procter & Gamble
Co. v. Atlantic Oil Trans. Co., 65 F. (2d) 589; Great Lakes
Towing Co. v. Mills Transportation,Co., 155 Fed. 11; In
re P. Sanford Ross, 204 Fed. 248.
The warranty of seaworthiness which the law affirmatively implies in every such contract was admittedly
breached by petitioner; there is no valid ground for a
distinction between an express warranty and an implied
warranty in such cases, and this Court, in Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., 249 U.S. 334, established the rule that the breach of an implied warranty of
seaworthiness will defeat limitation.
Respondent was demise charterer of the scow and bailee
of her cargo at the time of the loss, and its right to maintain a suit to recover the cargo loss as bailee thereof, for
breach of the warranty of seaworthiness, was declared by
this Court in Pendletonv. Benner Line, 246 U.S. 353.
Petitioner failed to show that the unseaworthy condition of the scow was without its privity or knowledge.

CULLEN FUEL CO. v. HEDGER CO.
82

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusrcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioner owned a deck scow known as Cullen No.
32. The respondent wished to use her to lighter ore from
ship-side in New York harbor to the plant of the Grasselli
Chemical Co., the consignee of the ore. A charter for an
indefinite term, at a fixed daily rate of hire, was orally arranged by telephone with the petitioner's marine superintendent. The day following the demise, while being
loaded from the ship, the scow capsized, dumped her cargo,
and damaged an adjacent wharf and vessel. Suits ensued,
one of them by the respondent as bailee of the cargo,
against the petitioner as owner of the scow. Limitation
of liability was sought by the petitioner, but the district
court refused a decree for limitation,' finding that the scow
was unseaworthy at the time of the demise.
The circuit court of appeals concurred in this finding and
based its affirmance 2 of the trial court's decision upon the
ground that as the charter was the personal contract of the
owner and included an implied warranty of seaworthiness
the petitioner was precluded from the benefit of the limitation statutes.8
The petitioner, conceding that where the owner personally expressly warrants seaworthiness he is not entitled
to the benefit of ihe limited liability statutes, (Pendleton
v. Benner Line, 246 U.S. 353; Luckenbach v. McCahan
Sugar Refining Co., 248 U.S. 139), correctly states that
despite the decision of this court in Capitol Transportation Co. v. CambriaSteel Co., 249 U.S. 334, the contrariety
of opinion which existed in the various circuits prior to

that case, as to the effect of the implied warranty of the
owner, 4 still persists.' We therefore granted certiorari.'
We pass, without discussion, the contentions that the
court below erred in its rulings that the owner's contract
was personal and that the respondent as bailee of the
cargo was entitled to recover from the charterer, as we are
of opinion that both points were correctly decided (The
Benjamin Noble, 232 Fed. 382; 244 Fed. 95; Capitol
TransportationCo. v. CambriaSteel Co., supra;Pendleton
v. Benner Line, supra, 355-356), and come to the question
of petitioner's right of limitation notwithstanding the implied warranty of seaworthiness. The Capitol Transportation case is an authority against the right. As appears
by the opinion of the district court (232 Fed. 382) the
contract of the owner in that case was oral and no express
warranty was given.
We see no reason to restrict or modify the rule there
announced. The warranty of seaworthiness is implied
from the circumstances of the parties and the subjectmatter of the contract and may be negatived only by express covenant." It is as much a part of the contract as
any express stipulation. Hudson Canal Co. v. Penna.
Coal Co., 8 Wall. 276, 288; Grossman v. Schenker, 206
N.Y. 466, 469; 100 N.E. 39; United States v. Bentley &
Sons Co., 293 Fed. 229.
The petitioner urges that the denial of limitation in
cases like this will sweep away much of the protection

view disregards the nature of the warranty. The fitness
of the ship at the moment of breaking ground is the matter
warranted, and not her suitability under conditions thereafter arising which are beyond the owner's control. Compare Armour & Co. v. Fort Morgan S. S. Co., 270 U.S. 253;

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 32.

Argued October 20, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

I. An assessment for state taxation of lands owned by the United
States is void. P. 91.
2. Bonds issued under authority of statutes of Idaho providing for
the creation of local improvement districts (Idaho Comp. Stats.,
1919, §§ 3999-4151) have no general lien on the lands in the
district and, save through the assessment, no special lien on any
tract. P. 94.
3. The acquisition by the United States of lands in local improvement districts created under authority of statutes of Idaho (supra),
frustrating the replenishment, by a reassessment, of the assessment fund, which was the sole source of payment of bonds
issued to finance the improvements-no lien remaining on the
lands when the purchases by the United States were consummated,
and a reassessment thereafter being ineffective to create one--.
was not a taking of the bondholder's property, and the District
Court was without jurisdiction under the Tucker Act of a suit to
recover the amount remaining due on the bonds. P. 94.
4. The acts of the Government's agents in withholding a portion
of the purchase money pending an investigation of the possibility
that the realty would be liable for a reassessment did not give
rise to an implied contract on the part of the Government to pay
any balance remaining due on the bonds if no lien existed at the
date of acquisition. A purpose to pay only valid subsisting liens
