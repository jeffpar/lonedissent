persists in his defiance, he may be caught in his own
snares.
The form of turnover orders in bankruptcy proceedings
has been much considered in the federal courts. It has
provoked a difference of opinion. In accord with the decision of the court below are decisions of the Court of
Appeals for, the ninth circuit and the first. In re Miller
& Harbaugh,54 F. (2d) 612; In re Goldman, 62 F. (2d)
421, one judge dissenting. The contrary view has been
taken in the fourth circuit and the second. Kirsner v.
Taliaferro, 202 Fed. 51; In re H. Magen Co., 10 F. (2d)
91. Many orders not unlike the one in question have
been upheld sub silentio in the absence of objection.
Prela v. Hubshman, 278 U.S. 358; Epstein v. Steinfeld,
210 Fed. 23.6; Sheinman v. Chalmers, 33 F. (2d) 902;
In re Cohan, 41 F. (2d) 632.
The order should be reversed and the cause remanded
to the District Court with instructions to proceed in
accordance with this opinion.

INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 33.

Argued October 19, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

1. What are "ordinary and necessary expenses" in carrying on a:
business, within the meaning of provisions of Revenue Acts allowing
deductions of such expenses in computing net income, must be
determined by conduct and forms of speech prevailing in the
business world. P. 113.
2. The Court can not say, in the absence of proof and as a matter of
judicial knowledge, that payments on the debts of a corporation,
made by its former officer after its discharge in bankruptcy and
for the purpose of strengthening his own business standing and
credit, were ordinary and necessary expenses of his business. P. 115.

3. A finding by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that such payments are not ordinary and necessary expenses of a taxpayer, and
hence not deductible under the revenue acts and regulations in
computing his net income, is presumptively correct. P. 115.

CERTIORARI,

Mr. Edward S. Stringer, with whom Messrs. Thomas
D. O'Brien, and Alexander E. Horn were on the brief,
for petitioner.
Mr. H. Brian Holland argued the cause, and Solicitor
General Biggs and Messrs. Sewall Key and John G.
Remey filed a brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARDozo delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question to be determined is whether payments by
a taxpayer, who is in business as a commission agent, are
allowable deductions in the computation of his income if
made to the creditors of a bankrupt corporation in an
endeavor to strengthen his own standing and credit.
In 1922 petitioner was the secretary of the E. L. Welch
Company, a Minnesota corporation, engaged in the grain
business. The company was adjudged an involuntary
bankrupt, and had a discharge from its debts. Thereafter
the petitioner made a contract with the Kellogg Company
to purchase grain for it on a commission. In order to
re~stablish his relations with customers whom he had
known when acting for the Welch Company and to solidify
his credit and standing, he decided to pay the debts of
the Welch business so far as he was able. In fulfilment
of that resolve, he 'made payments of substantial amounts
during five successive years. In 1924, the commissions

were $18,028.20; the payments $3,975.97; in 1923, the
commissions $31,377.07; the payments $11,968.20; in
1926,. the commissions $20,9.25.25, the payments $12,815.72; in .1927, the commissions $22,119.61, the payments
$7,379.72; and in 1928, the commissions $26,177.56, the
payments $11,068.25. The Commissioner ruled that these
payments were not deductible from income as ordinary
and necessary expenses, but were rather in the nature of
capital expenditures, an outlay for the development of
reputation and good will. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the action of the Commissioner (25 B.T.A. 117),
and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.
63 F. (2d) 976. The case is here on certiorari.
" In computing net income there shall be allowed as
deductions . . . all the ordinary and necessary expenses
paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on
any trade or business." Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43
Stat. 253, 269, § 214; 26 U.S.C. § 955; Revenue Act of
1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 26, § 214; 26 U.S.C.App. § 955;
Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 799, § 23; cf.
Treasury Regulations 65, Arts. 101, 292, under the Revenue Act of 1924, and similar regulations under the Acts of
1926 and 1928.
We may assume that the payments to creditors of the
Welch Company were necessary for the development of
the petitioner's business, at least in the sense that they
were appropriate and helpful. McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. 316. He certainly thought they were, and we
should be slow to override his judgment. But the problem is not solved when the payments are characterized as
necessary. Many necessary payments are charges upon
capital. There is need to determine whether they are
both necessary and ordinary. Now, what is ordinary,
though there must always be a strain of constancy within
it, is none the less a variable affected by time and place

and circumstance. Ordinary in this context does not
mean that the payments must be habitual or normal in
the sense that the same taxpayer will have to make them
often. A lawsuit affecting the safety of a business may
happen once in a lifetime. The counsel fees may be so
heavy that repetition is unlikely. None the less, the expense is an ordinary one because we know from experience
that payments for such a purpose, whether the amount is
large or small, are the common and accepted means of
defense against attack. Cf. Kornhauserv. United States,
276 U.S. 145. The situation is unique in the life of the
individual affected, but not in the life of the group, the
community, of which he is a part. At such times there
are norms of conduct that help to stabilize our judgment,
and make it certain and objective. The instance is not
erratic, but is brought within a known type.
The line of demarcation is now visible between the case
that is here and the one supposed for illustration. We
try to classify this act as ordinary or the opposite, and
the norms of conduct fail us. No longer can we have recourse to any fund of business experience, to any known
business practice. Men do at times pay the debts of
others without legal obligation or the lighter obligation
imposed by the usages of trade or by neighborly amenities, but they do not do so ordinarily, not even though
the result might be to heighten their reputation for generosity and opulence. Indeed, if language is to be read in
its natural and common meaning (Old Colony R. Co. v.
Commissioner, 284 U.S. 552, 560; Woolford Realty Co. v.
Rose, 286 U.S. 319, 327), we should have to say that payment in such circumstances, instead of being ordinary is
in a high degree extraordinary. There is nothing ordinary in the stimulus evoking it, and none inthe response.
Here, indeed, as so often in other branches of the law, the
decisive distinctions are those of degree and not of kind.

WELCH v. HELVERING.

Opinion of the Court.

One struggles in vain for any verbal lormula that will supply a ready touchstone. The standard set up by the
statute is not a rule of law; it is rather a way of life.
Life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the
riddle.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue resorted to that
standard in assessing the petitioner's income, and found
that the payments in controversy came closer to capita:
outlays than to ordinary and necessary expenses in the operation of a business. His ruling has the support of a
presumption of correctness, and the petitioner has the
burden of proving it to be wrong. Wickwire v. Reinecke,
275 U.S. 101; Jones v. Commissioner, 38 F. (2d) 550, 552.
Unless we can say from facts within our -knowledge that
these are ordinary and necessary expenses according to
the ways of conduct and the forms of speech prevailing
in the business world, the tax must be confirmed. But
nothing told us by this record or within the sphere of our
judicial notice permits us to give that extension to what is
ordinary and necessary. Indeed, to do so would open the
door to many bizarre analogies. One man has a family
name that is clouded by thefts committed by an ancestor.
To add to his own standing he repays the stolen money,
wiping off, it maybe, his income for the year. The payments figure in his tax return as ordinary expenses. Another man conceives the notion that he will be able to practice his vocation with greater ease and profit if he has an
opportunity to enrich his culture. Forthwith the price
of his education becomes an expense of the business, reducing the income subject to taxation. There is little difference between these expenses and those in controversy
here. Reputation and learning are akin to capital assets,
like the good will of an old partnership. Cf. Colony Coal
& Coke Corp. v. Commissioner, 52 F. (2d) 923. For
many, they are the only tools with which to hew a path-

way to success. The money spent in acquiring them is
well and wisely spent. It is not an ordinary expense of
the operation of a business.
Many cases in the federal courts deal with phases of
the problem presented in the case at bar. To attempt to
harmonize them would be a futile task. They involve the
appreciation of particular situations, at times with borderline conclusions. Typical illustrations are cited in the
margin.*

61 F. (2d) 726, payments in settlement of a lawsuit against a member
of a partnership, the effect being to enable him to devote his undivided efforts to the partnership business and also to protect its credit.
