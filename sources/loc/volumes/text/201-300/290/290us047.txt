The Amendment applies to warrants under any statute;
revenue, tariff, and all others. No warrant inhibited by it
can be made effective by an act of Congress or otherwise.
It is argued that searches for goods smuggled into the
United States in fraud of the revenue, based upon affidavits of suspicion or belief, have been sustained from the
earliest times; that this practice was authorized by the
Revenue Act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat. 43, also subsequent
like enactments. But we think nothing in these statutes
indicates that a warrant to search a private dwelling may
rest upon mere affirmance of suspicion or belief without
disclosure of supporting facts or circumstances.
Although relied upon, we find nothing in Locke v.
United States and Boyd v. United States which upholds
the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The first of
these causes was a proceeding to forfeit a cargo of imported
goods seized for violation of the revenue laws. It presented no question concerning the validity of a warrant.
The second denied the right to compel production of pri.vate papers in a suit by the United States to establish a
forfeiture of goods fraudulently imported.
Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may not properly issue a warrant to search a private dwelling unless he
can find probable cause therefor from facts or circumstances presented to him under oath or affirmation. Mere
affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough.
Reversed.

No. 13.

Argued October 12, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

1. Upon default after partial performance of a building contract, 'the
measure of damages recoverable by a mortgagee-obligeo on a bond
guaranteeing completion, is the difference between the value, at the

time of default, of the property with the buildings uncompleted
and the value it would have had with the buildings completed;
not exceeding, however, either the amount due on the mortgage of
the amount of the bond. Pp. 53, 55.
So held although the value of the property with the buildings
uncompleted, at the time of the guarantor's default, exceeded the
sum of the mortgage and all prior liens; it appearing that the
mortgagee-obligee, because its mortgage was not then due, was
unable to protect itself by foreclosure; that thereafter the property
steadily declined in value; and that its interest was subsequently
wiped out by foreclosure of a prior lien.
2. This is the settled rule in Pennsylvania. P. 53.
3. Even though the federal courts, in determining questions of general law, may exercise an independent judgment, yet, for the sake
of harmony and to avoid confusion, they will lean, where the question is balanced with doubt, towards an agreement of views with
the state courts. A fortiori where the decisions of the state courts
are plainly right. P. 54.

Whether the case be regarded as presenting a question

of the state court of last resort should be followed by the
federal courts. No federal question is involved. The

There is no substantial difference between the measure
of damages recoverable by a mortgagee-obligee for the
breach of a bond giving an absolute guarantee of completion and for the breach of a bond indemnifying against
loss for failure to complete. Purdy v. Massey, 306 Pa.
288, 297.

If the contractor defaults and the building is not fully
erected, the legal interest of the mortgagee which is adversely affected and which the law will be compelled
to protect, and as to which compensation may be claimed,
is the loss to the mortgagee of his security by reason of
the contractor's default. Thus the mortgagee-obligee is
entitled to recover as damages the amount by which the

security has been depleted by the failure of the contractor
to perform, or so much of the difference between the
value of the completed and uncompleted operation as
would be necessary, together with the value of the property in the condition in which it is left by the contractor,
to pay the mortgage debt and the interest thereon. Province Securities Corp. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 269 Mass.

Questions of suretyship ate matters of general jurisprudence, and those relating to the measure of damages

The use of completion bonds throughout the Nation requires a national uniform law and, therefore, questions
pertaining thereto are matters of general jurisprudence.
Irrespective of whether the question of measure of damages in this case be considered a matter of general jurisprudence, the federal courts below were entitled to exercise an independent judgment concerning it. Burgess v.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
On October 13, 1927, petitioner conveyed to a building
company a tract of real estate consisting of fifty-two lots,
with the result that the building company became indebted to petitioner in the sum of $28,000, being part of
the purchase price. The building company, in order to
finance its operations, borrowed sums of money from two
different corporations, to one of which it gave a first mortgage upon the real estate, and to the other a second mortgage. The building company then gave to petitioner its
note for $28,000, and assigned as collateral security there-

for its equity in the second mortgage. Petitioner accepted
this security-in effect a third mortgage-upon the representation and warranty of the building company that a
building and certain improvements would be erected, in
accordance with plans and specifications, upon each of the
fifty-two lots. The performance of this obligation was
guaranteed by a bond in the sum of $220,000, executed
by respondent, conditioned, among other things, to become void if within ten-months from the date thereof, October 13, 1927, each of the fifty-two lots should be fully
improved with a building, together with certain other improvements, in keeping with, and as shown by, the plans,
specifications, etc.; otherwise to remain in full force and
effect. The property is located in Pennsylvania, and the
contract and the obligations of the bond were to be performed within that state.
Suit was brought in a federal district court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania to recover damages for a
breach of the bond. A jury was waived; and after a
hearing, the trial judge found that on August 13, 1928, the
date fixed for the completion of the buildings and improvements, twenty-four of the houses had been completed and twenty-eight had not been fully completed.
The value of the lots with the twenty-eight uncompleted
houses, as of the date last mentioned, was $6,700 each, an
amount slightly in excess of the sum of petitioner's mortgage on each and of all prior liens. Completed, they
would, on that date, have been worth $7,950 each. It is
not disputed that at the time of the breach of the bond
petitioner, under the terms of the mortgages, was powerless to protect itself by foreclosure; and the court found
that thereafter the value of real estate, generally and in
the locality, had steadily declined. On January 25, 1930,
the first mortgage was foreclosed and the property bought
in for the sum of $50, thus wiping out the second mortgage and the equity of petitioner therein. Petitioner has

received on account of the indebtedness of $28,000 the
sum of $13,026.02 only, leaving $14,973.98 still owing on
the principal.
Upon these facts the trial court held that while the
owner of property, in case of a default after partial performance of a building contract, would be entitled to
recover from the surety the difference between the value
of the property with the uncompleted buildings and its
value with the buildings completed, the rule is otherwise
in the case of a mortgagee-obligee. Following this view,
that court concluded that the measure of damages in the
instant case "is so much of the difference between the
value of the property as of August 13, 1928, with the
houses uncompleted, and the value it would have had on
that date had the houses been completed as would have
been necessary to pay the plaintiff's mortgage debt as well
as all prior liens. Since the value of the property as ,of
August 13, 1928, was more than the sum of the plaintiff's
mortgage and prior liens, the plaintiff is not entitled to any
substantial damages." The court, therefore, awarded
nominal damages only. 49 F. (2d) 769. This judgment
the circuit court of appeals affirmed. 62 F. (2d) 487.
With that conclusion we are unable to agree.
It is very clear that the settled rule in Pennsylvania is
to the contrary. In Purdy v. Massey, 306 Pa. 288; 159
Atl. 545, where prior cases are reviewed, the court held
that where there is an absolute undertaking to erect and
complete a building, the surety in case of default is bound
to take the place of the principal and erect the building,
and the cost of doing that which should have been done is
the measure of damages for which the surety is liable, not
exceeding the amount of the bond. There the owner of a
first purchase-money mortgage had subordinated her
security to another mortgage in consideration of the giving
of a bond in all substantial respects like the one here
under consideration. The building provided for was not

erected, and the mortgagee brought suit against the surety
on the bond. The court held that the bond was one of
guaranty and awarded as damages the full cost of completion, such cost not exceeding the amount due on the
mortgage. The applicable rule is thus stated (p. 295):
"In fixing compensation for damage resulting from
breach of a contract the general rule is that the injured
party should be placed in the same position as if there
had been no breach. The object of the law is to place
such party in as good position as if the contract had been
kept. In the instant case the bond guaranteed the completion of the building; if there had not been a breach of
the obligation of the bond, the building would have been
erected. Since this was not done, the plaintiff- can only
be put in as good position as if the contract had been carried out by giving her the cost of construction, not exceeding, of course, the amount of the bond. The measure of
damage on a bond guaranteeing completion is the cost of
completion: . . . And in a case such as this, where the
work was never begun, this cost will be the whole cost of
construction."
See also Mechanics Trust Co. v. Fid. & Cas. CUo., 304
Pa. 526, 533, et seq.; 156 Atl. 146. A like rule obtains in
other states. United Real Estate Co. v. McDonald, 140
Mo. 605, 612; 41 S.W. 913; Kidd v. McCormick, 83 N.Y.
391. Compare Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wall. 94, 99.
The circuit court of appeals held that the Pennsylvania
decisions merely declared the common law of that state
with regard to suretyship, and, since that law Is derived
from the principles of general jurisprudence common to all
the states, a federal court in determining what it is might
exercise an independent judgment. We do not deem it
necessary to discuss the principle enunciated or to decide
whether the Pennsylvania decisions come within it. It is
enough to say that even where the principle applies, "for
the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the Federal

TRAINOR CO. v. AETNA CASUALTY CO.

Opinion of the Court.

courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the
State courts if the question seems to them balanced with
doubt." Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U.S. 20, 33-34. And
see Sim v. Edenborn, 242 U.S. 131, 135, where the authorities are collected; Community Bldg. Co. v. Maryland
Casualty Co., 8 F. (2d) 678, 680. In the present case it
would not be going far enough to say merely that the
question is "balanced with doubt," for it seems to us that
the Pennsylvania decisions, and those of the other states
cited above, are plainly right. Compare Messenger v.
Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444.
The petitioner here, not being willing to accept a third
mortgage on the unimproved land to secure its debt, required the added security which would be afforded by
completed improvements. These improvements the
building company agreed to make within a definitely fixed
time, and for the performance of that undertaking respondent, for a valuable consideration, stood sponsor.
Plainly the obligation of the bond was one of guaranty
ald not indemnity, and could be fulfilled only by the
erection of the buildings or payment of the penalty in
case of default. It is no answer to say that the value of
the property immediately after the default exceeded the
sum of the mortgage together with all prior liens. Petitioner was then without remedy against the property
because its mortgage was not in default. It was, therefore, obliged to sit by and await the action of others over
which it had no control. In the meantime, the uncompleted buildings necessarily lay unrented, subject to expense in the way of taxes, insurance, accumulating interest, etc., deteriorating in quality and steadily declining in
value. Petitioner isentitled to be put in as good position
in respect of its debt as it would have occupied if the
buildings had been completed in accordance with the
terms of the undertaking; and this can be done here only
by giving it the amount of the difference between the

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

value of the unfinished buildings and their value as it
would have been if completed in accordance with the
agreement-see Kidd v. McCormick, supra, p. 398--but
exceeding neither the amount due on its debt nor the
amount of the bond.
It appears from the findings that this difference would
be about $26,000, while the amount now due petitioner
is $14,973.98, together with interest thereon from August
13, 1928. It follows that the judgments of the courts below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court with directions to enter judgment for the last
named sum.
Reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 38.

Argued October 19, 20, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.

1. Section 402 of the Revenue Act of 1921 provides that, in determining the value of the gross estate of a decedent for the
purpose of the federal estate tax, there shall be included the
value at the time of his death of all property "to the extent of
the interest therein held jointly or as tenants by the entirety by
the decedent and any other person." Held, the inclusion, in the
gross estate of a decedent who died while the provision of this
section was in effect, of one-half the value of property held by
him and his wife as joint tenants, though the tenancy was created
prior to the effective date of the statute, was not a retroactive
application of the statute. P. 58.
2. The cessation at death of decedent's interest in, and control over,
half of property held with another as joint tenants presented a
proper occasion for the imposition of a tax. Guinn v. Commissioner, 287 U.S. 224. P. 58.
62 F. (2d) 591, affirmed.
