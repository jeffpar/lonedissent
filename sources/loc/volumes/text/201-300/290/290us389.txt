Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case is here for the second time.
The respondent was indicted for refusal to give testimony and supply information as to deductions claimed
in his 1927 and 1928 income tax returns for moneys paid
to others. By a special plea he averred that he ought not
to be prosecuted under the indictment, because if he had
answered the questions put to him he would have given
information tending to incriminate him, in contravention
of the Fifth Amendment. The United States demurred
on the grounds that the plea failed to show that the information demanded would have incriminated or subjected
the defendant to prosecution under federal law, and that
the defendant waived his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. The demurrer was overruled. Upon appeal this
court reversed the judgment for the reason that; at the
hearing befdre the federal revenue agent, the defendant
had not invoked the protection of the Fifth Amendment
against possible prosecution under federal legislation, but
solely under state laws. The cause was remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings. United States v.
Murdock, 284 U.S. 141.
The petitioner pleaded not guilty, was put upon trial
and convicted. He appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment,' and the case was
brought here by writ of certiorari.' The question presented is whether the trial court correctly instructed the
jury as to what constitutes a violation of the sections of
the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928 upon which the indictment was based.
Section 256 of the Revenue Act of 1926, and § 148 of
the Revenue Act of 1928, in identical words, require all

persons making payment to another to make a true and
accurate return to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
under such regulations as he shall prescribe, setting forth
the amount paid and the name and address of the recipient.' Section 1104 of the Act of 1926 and § 618 of
the Act of 1928 authorize the Commissioner, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or of
making a return where none has been made, through
officers or employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue,
to examine books, papers, records and memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return, and to compel the attendance of the taxpayer or
any one having knowledge of the premises, and to take
testimony with reference to the matter directed by law
to be included in the return, with power to administer
oaths to the persons to be interrogated.'
Section 1114 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 declares: '
"Any person required under this Act to pay any tax,
or required by law or regulations made under authority
thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any
information, for the purposes of the computation, assessment, or collection of any tax imposed by this Act, who
willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep
such records, or supply such information, at the time
or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition
to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more
than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year,
or both, together with the costs of prosecution."
Section 146 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 is identical
with the quoted section of the 1926 Act.' The indictment

Opinion of the Court.

in two counts charged violation of the provisions of the
two sections last mentioned.
Upon the trial the Government proved the respondent
had been duly summoned to appear before a revenue
agent for examination; questions had been put to him; he
refused to answer, stating he feared self-incrimination,
and upon further inquiry disclosed that his fear was based
upon possible prosecutions under state statutes. The
Government also offered evidence that on a prior occasion
at a meeting with certain revenue agents the respondent
had refused to disclose the name of the payee of the sums
deducted by him in his returns for 1927 and 1928. To
this, counsel for the respondent objected, on the ground
that it was irrelevant to the issue, which was the respondent's refusal to answer when summoned, sworn and interrogated. The prosecuting attorney replied that the willfulness of the respondent's refusal to answer was in issue,
and that the proposed evidence bore upon that matter.
The court overruled the objection and admitted the testimony. The respondent offered no evidence. In the
course of his charge the trial judge said:
"So far as the facts are concerned in this case, gentlemen of the jury, I want to instruct you that whatever the
court may say as to the facts, is only the court's view.
You are at liberty to entirely disregard it. The court feels
from the evidence in this case that the Government has
sustained the burden cast upon it by the law and has
proved that this defendant is guilty in manner and form
as charged beyond a reasonable doubt."
The respondent's request for an instruction in the following words was refused:
"If you believe that the reasons stated by the defendant in his refusal to answer questions were given in good
faith and based upon his actual belief, you should consider
that in determining whether or not his refusal to answer
the questions was wilful."

In the circumstances we think the trial judge erred in
stating the opinion that the respondent was guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt. A federal judge may analyze the evidence, comment upon it, and express his views with regard to the testimony of witnesses. He may advise the
jury in respect of the facts, but the decision of issues of
fact must be fairly left to the jury, Patton v. United States,
281 U.S. 276, 288; Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466.
Although the power of the judge to express an opinion
as to the guilt of the defendant exists, it should be exercised cautiously and only in exceptional cases. Such an
expression of opinion was held not to warrant a reversal
where upon the undisputed and admitted facts the defendant's voluntary conduct amounted to the commission
ofi the crime defined by the statute. Horning v. District
of Columbia, 254 U.S. 135. The present, however, is not
such a case, unless the word "willfully," used in the sections upon which the indictment was founded, means no
more than voluntarily.
The word often denotes an act which is intentional, or
Inowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental.
But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an
act done with a bad piurpose (Felton v. United States, 96
U.S. 699; Potter v. United States, 155 U.S. 438; Spurr v.
United States, 174 U.S. 728); without justifiable excuse
(Felton v. United States, supra; Williams v. People, 26
Colo. 272; 57 Pac. 701; People vwJewell, 138 Mich 620;
101 N.W: 835; St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Batesville
& W. Tel. Co., 80 Ark. 499; 97 S.W. 660; Clay v. State,
52 Tex. Cr. 555; 107 S.W. 1129); stubbornly, obstinately,
perversely, Wales v. Miner, 89 Ind. 118, 127; Lynch v.
Commonwealth, i31 Va. 762; 109 S.E. 427; Claus v. Chicago Gt. W. Ry. Co., 136 Iowa 7; 111 N.W. 15; State v.
Harwell, 129 N.C. 550; 40 S.E. 48. The word is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for
believing it is lawful (Roby v. Newton, 121 Ga. 679; 49

UNITED STATES v. MURDOCK.
389

Opinion of the Court.

S.E. 694), or conduct marked by careless disregard
whether or not one has the right so to act, United States
v. Philadelphia& R. Ry. Co., 223 Fed. 207, 210; State v.
Savre, 129 Iowa 122; 105 N.W. 387; State v. Morgan, 136
N.C. 628; 48 S.E. 670.
This court has held that where directions as to the
method of conducting a business are embodied in a revenue act to prevent loss of taxes, and the act declares a
willful failure to observe the directions a penal offense, an
evil motive is a constituent element of the crime. In
Felton v. United States, supra, the court considered a
statute which required distillers to maintain certain apparatus to prevent the abstraction of spirits during the
process of distillation and which declared that if any distiller should" knowingly and wilfully" omit, neglect, or refuse to do anything required by law in conducting his business he should be liable to a penalty. It appeared that in
defendant's plant defective appliances caused an overflow
and wastage of low wines, and to save these it became
necessary, in disregard of the method prescribed by the
Act, to catch the spirits and pour them into vats. This
was done despite instructions to the contrary by the government officers who were consulted as to what procedure
should be followed. It was admitted that the action was
innocent in purpose, saved loss of the product to the
owner and taxes to the United States. In an action for
the statutory penalty the conduct of the distiller was
held not to be willful within the meaning of the law.
Aid in arriving at the meaning of the word "willfully"
may be afforded by the context in wlich it is used (United
States v. Sioux City Stock Yards Co., 162 Fed. 556, 562),
and, we think, in the present instance the other omissions
which the statute denounces in the same sentence only if
willful, aid in ascertaining the meaning as respects the
offense here charged. The Revenue Acts coinniand the
citizen, where required by law or regulations, to pay the

tax, to make a return, to keep records, and to supply information for computation, assessment or collection of the
tax. He whose conduct is defined as criminal is one who
" willfully" fails to pay the tax, to make a return, to keep
the required records, or to supply the needed information.
Congress did not intend that a person, by reason of a
bona fide misunderstanding as to his liability for the tax,
as to his duty to make a return, or as to the adequacy of
the records he maintained, should become a criminal by
his mere failure to measure up to the prescribed standard
of conduct. And the requirement that the omission in
these instances, must be willful, to be criminal, is persuasive that the same element is essential to the offense
of failing to supply information.
It follows that the respondent was entitled to the
charge he requested with respect to his good faith and
actual belief. Not until this court pronounced judgment
in United States v. Murdock, 284 U.S. 141, had it been
definitely settled that one under examination in a federal
tribunal could not refuse to answer on account of probable incrimination under state law. The question was
involved, but not decided, in Ballman v. Fagin, 200 U.S.
186, 195, and specifically reserved in Vajtauer v. Comm'r
of Immigration, 273 U.S. 103, 113. The trial court could
not, therefore, properly tell the jury the defendant's
assertion of the privilege was so unreasonable and ill
founded as to exhibit bad faith and establish willful
wrongdoing. This was the effect of the instructions
given. We think the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly
upheld the respondent's right to have the question of
absence of evil motive submitted to the jury, and we are
of opinion that the requested instruction was apt for the
purpose.
The Government relies on Sinclair v. United States, 279
U.S. 263. That case, however, construed an altogether

different statutory provision. Sinclair was indicted for refusal to answer a question pertinent to a matter under
investigation by a committee of the Senate. The Act
upon which the indictment was based declared " Every
person who having been summoned as a witness by the
authority of either House of Congress, to give testimony or
to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before
either House, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared,
refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question
under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, . . ." ' Two distinct offenses are described in the
disjunctive, and in only one of them is willfulness an element. Sinclair having been summoned attended the hearing. He was therefore guilty of no willful default in obeying a summons. He refused to answer certain questions
not because his answers might incriminate him, for he
asserted they would not, but on the ground the questions
were not pertinent or relevant to the matters then under
inquiry. The applicable statute did not make a bad purpose or evil intent an element of the misdemeanor of refusing to answer, but conditioned guilt or innocence solely
upon the relevancy of the question propounded. Sinclair
was either right or wrong in his refusal to answer, and if
wrong he took the risk of becoming liable to the prescribed
penalty. Here we are concerned with a statute which denounces a willful failure to do various things thought to
be requisite to a proper administration of the income tax
law, and the Government, in the trial below, we think correctly, assumed that it carried the burden of showing more
than a mere voluntary failure to supply information, with
intent, in good faith, to exercise a privilege granted the
witness by the Constitution. The respondent's refusal to
answer was intentional and without legal justification, but

by bad faith or evil intent, which the statute makes an
element of the offense.
