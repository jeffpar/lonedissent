The same Congress that proposed the Fourth Amendment passed the Act of July 31, 1789, which, practically
speaking, has been in force ever since and is virtually the
Tariff Act of 1922 as it relates to searches and seizures.
From the very beginning, therefore, it was recognized

that searches and seizures were necessary to maintain
revenue and to prevent violations of the customs and navigation laws; and equally so that to be effective they could
not await conviction upon proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, or the production of prima face evidence, but
that the search was reasonable or permissible if the
customs officer acted upon bona fide belief and justified
suspicion, or information that appeared to be reliable.

It 'is certain the Fourth Amendment did not contemplate that the cellar of a man's house should afford a safe
haven for smuggled goods or constitute a barrier against
those authorized and required to find them. It seems,
therefore, that good ground may exist for the distinction
made in this case by the court below between a case
under the revenue acts and a case under the.prohibition
law. Bookbinder v. United States, 287 Fed. 790; cert.

An eyewitness can hardly be expected or required in
this class of cases. Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch

Searches and seizures under the Prohibition and
Espionage Acts, are, as a general statement, intended to
procure evidence primarily for the purpose of convicting
a defendant, and the warrants may be sworn out by any
person producing evidence or making the necessary
affidavit. On the other hand, under the Customs and
Revenue laws, the primary purpose is to collect revenue,
and prevent smuggling, and it is contemplated that the
warrant will be applied for by an officer of some standing
and experience who ordinarily will act with a reasonable
amount of discretion, without being overcome by exces-

sive zeal or personal prejudice. Besides, to apply the
same rule in this class of cases "would render the provision totally inoperative," as observed by Chief Justice
Marshall in Locke v. United States., supra., p. 16.
The fact that the search warrant was obtained and
seizure made under the Tariff Act, but that Nathanson
was convicted under the Prohibition Act, affords no
ground- for reversal, nor is the question raised in his
behalf. Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In the trial court, where he was defendant under a criminal information, petitioner Nathanson duly, but unsuccessfully, challenged the admission as evidence of certain
liquors scized under color of a search warrant, issued, he
claimed, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment against
him.
Upon complaint of the customs agent in charge, a State
judge sent out the questioned warrant. Its pertinent recitals and command follow:
"Whereas said Francis B. Laughlin has stated under
his oath that he has cause to suspect and does believe that
certain merchandise, to wit: Certain liquors of foreign
origin a more particular description of which cannot be
given, upon which the duties have not been paid, or
which has otherwise been brought into the United States
contrary to law, and that said merchandise is now deposited and contained within the premises of J. J.Nathanson said premises being described as a 2 story frame dwelling located at 117 No. Bartram Ave. . . .; and

"
"Whereas said Francis B. Laughlin has requested that
a warrant issue to him, authorizing him to enter said
premises and search for and seize said merchandise:

Opinion of the Court.

"Now, therefore, you are commanded, in the name and
by the authority of the President of the United States, to
enter and search the premises hereinbefore described, in
the daytime (if a dwelling house) at any time of the day
or night (if other than a dwelling house) and to seize and
take into your possession the merchandise hereinbefore
described, or so much thereof as may be found, to the end
that the same may be dealt with according to law."
The Circuit Court of Appeals said [63 F. (2d) 937,
9381-" The appellant contends that the affidavit upon
which the search warrant was issued showed no facts upon
which to base a finding of probable cause; that the search
warrant was therefore illegal; and that the use of the
property so seized as evidence in a criminal prosecution
amounted to a violation of the protection afforded by the
Fourth Amendment to the Constitution ...
"Had this warrant issued under authority of the Pro-

hibition Act, it would be invalid, since the affidavit was
merely based upon cause to suspect and suspicion. It
issued, however, under the authority of [ยง 595] the Tariff
Act of 1930

to law, he may make application, under oath, to any justice of the

store or other place at night or by day, and to search for and seize
such merchandise....

niary interest in the smuggled goods. Following the reasoning in the cases cited, we conclude that that interest
was sufficient to justify the issuance of the search warrant
and that the search and seizure, based oit the sworn complaint (phrased almost in the very words of the Tariff
Act) and the warrant thereon, did not violate the constitutional rights of the defendant. This court, in Bookbinder v. United States, 287 Fed'. 790, certiorari denied,
262 U.S. 748, held that evidence obtained on a search warrant for violation of the customs laws is admissible in a
prosecution for violation of the prohibition laws."
We think the court below acted upon an erroneous
view. Its judgment must be reversed.
This court has often spoken concerning searches and
seizures and the limitations of the Fourth Amendment.
Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339; Boyd v. United
States, 116 U.S. 616; Adams v. New York, 192 U.S. 585,

States, 255 U.S. 298; Byars v. United States, 273 U.S. 28;
Maul v. United States, 274 U.S. 501; Go-Bart Importing
Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344; United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452. See also Cooley, Constitutional
Limitations, 7th ed., p. 427.
Here, we are dealing with a warrant to 6earch a private
dwelling said to have been authorized by the Tariff Act.
It went upon a mere affirmation of suspicion and belief
without any statement of adequate supporting facts.
All unreasonable searches and seizures are absolutely
forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. In some circumstances a public officer may make a lawful seizure without
a warrant; in others he may act only under permission of
one. In the present case the place of search and seizure
was a private dwelling. The challenged warrant is said
to constitute adequate authority therefor. The legality of
thieseizure depends upon its sufficiency. Did it issue upon
probable cause supported by oath or affirmation within
the intendment of the Amendment?

TRAINOR CO. v. AETNA CASUALTY CO.

Syllabus.

41

The Amendment applies to warrants under any statute;
revenue, tariff, and all others. No warrant inhibited by it
can be made effective by an act of Congress or otherwise.
It is argued that searches for goods smuggled into the
United States in fraud of the revenue, based upon affidavits of suspicion or belief, have been sustained from the
earliest times; that this practice was authorized by the
Revenue Act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat. 43, also subsequent
like enactments. But we think nothing in these statutes
indicates that a warrant to search a private dwelling may
rest upon mere affirmance of suspicion or belief without
disclosure of supporting facts or circumstances.
Although relied upon, we find nothing in Locke v.
United States and Boyd v. United States which upholds
the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The first of
these causes was a proceeding to forfeit a cargo of imported
goods seized for violation of the revenue laws. It presented no question concerning the validity of a warrant.
The second denied the right to compel production of pri.vate papers in a suit by the United States to establish a
forfeiture of goods fraudulently imported.
Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may not properly issue a warrant to search a private dwelling unless he
can find probable cause therefor from facts or circumstances presented to him under oath or affirmation. Mere
affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough.
Reversed.
