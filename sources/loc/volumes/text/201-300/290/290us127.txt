STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 8.

Argued October 16, 17, 1933.-Decided November 20, 1933.

1. Money paid out by the Government as the result of deliberate
construction of a statute on a question of known importance and
difficulty, was not paid "by mistake," even if the construction was
erroneous. P. 134.
2. In aujudicating the rights of carriers to the bounty granted by
§ 204 of the Transportation Act, 1920, the Interstate Commerce
Commission sits as a special tribunal, whose decisions are not appealable and bind the Government as well as the claimants. Pp.
135, 142.
3. In the performance of its functions as such tribunal, the Commission necessarily has jurisdiction to decide questions of the construction of the statute upon which depend the merits of the claims
before it. P. 136.
4. Where award and payment have been made, the Government can
not recover the money upon the ground that the Commission misconstrued a provision of the statute respecting the merits of the
claim. Pp. 136, 141.
5. Among other conditions to relief expressed in § 204, supra, is that
the carrier shall have "sustained a deficit in its railway operating
income for that portion . . . of the period of Federal control during which it operated its own railroad." Held, that the question
whether a "deficit " was sustained when operation was without
actual or "red ink" loss but with a less favorable balance than
during the "test period" preceding Federal control, was a question
going to the merits of a carrier's claim and not to the Commission's
jurisdiction over it. P. 136.

Argument for Petitioner.

290 U.S.

CERTIORAI, 289 U.S. 717, to review the affirmance of a
judgment for the United States, entered on the pleadings,
in an action to recover, with interest, money paid to the
railway company on an award of the Interstate Commerce
Commission under § 204 of the Transportation Act, 1920.

Mr. Daniel M. Kelly, with whom Mr. John A. Groeneveld was on the brief, for petitioner.
The construction of § 204 by the Interstate Commerce
Commission by virtue of which petitioner was reimbursed
was correct, as carrying out the intention of the Congress
.and as a liberal interpretation of the Transportation Act,
declared to be remedial by this Court.
The Interstate Commerce Commission was vested by
§§ 204 and 212 with power and jurisdiction to interpret
the law and determine the facts. The exercise of this
jurisdiction was not an exertion of a power delegated to
the Interstate Commerce Commission as such.
The decision of the Commission awarding reimbursement to petitioner was and is final and conclusive. It
can not be re-opened, reviewed, reversed or set aside,
"there being no such concurrent or subsequent authorization by Act of Congress. Work v. Rives, 267 U.S. 175.
Distinguishing Wisconsin Central Ry. Co. v, United
States, 164 U.S. 190. Cf. Great Northern Ry. Co. v.

Lumber Co. v. United States, 286 U.S. 290; United States
v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691. "
The Commission was constituted a court to deal with
these claims. The test of its jurisdiction is whether it
had power to enter upon the inquiry, which concededly
it had, and not whether its conclusions in the course of
the inquiry were right or wrong; for if the law confers
the power to render a judgment in a particular case, then

the court has jurisdiction. General Investment Co. v.
New York Central R. Co., 271 U.S. 228.
The complaint simply charges, not fraud, not mistake
of fact, not mistake of law, not lack of power, but solely
"erroneous and unwarranted construction." An erroneous and unwarranted construction of the law or the
facts is no basis for setting aside the decision and award
of reimbursement. United States v. Great Northern Ry.

The error in the decisiofi below is further clearly demonstrated by an analysis of the decisions of this Court in
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22; Interstate Commerce

Section 204 of the Transportation Act is not an amendment or part of the Interstate Commerce Act, nor is the
procedure under § 204 to be governed by the Interstate
Commerce Act. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United
States, 277 U.S. 172, 180.

been changed. In our system .of government, where
changes of officers are so frequent, it is of great importance
that there shall be no right in a new officer to reverse the
decisions of his predecessors. Unless this principle is followed, administrative and judicial action would become
involved in chaos; hence the reason for the rule of finality.
Grifenhagenv. Ordway, 218 N.Y. 481; Walling v. Broun,
76 Pac. 318; FrancisPalms, 7 L.D. 147.
If the position of the Government is sound in this case,
each succeeding Commission may make and revoke certificates and treat petitioner's claim as constantly before it.
The principles already discussed and the finality attached
to the certificate itself under § 212 (a) (of. United States
v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 287 U.S. 144), preclude such
subsequent action. Nor does Title II of the Transportation Act, by amendment or otherwise, contain any provision authorizing the Commission to grant rehearings
and correct miscalculations.
The reimbursement paid to petitioner was in no sense
a subsidy or bonus, and the Government has no other or
better right than any individual to reclaim it. The money
ex aequo et bono belongs to petitioner.
The payment of the money to petitioner was the result
of a compromise and settlement.
Assistant Attorney General Stephens, with whom
Solicitor General Biggs and Mr. Elmer B. Collins were
on the brief, for the United States.
The courts below and the Commission in its first ruling
and last decision were right in holding that since petitioner made a profit, it was not entitled to a payment
under § 204.
The decisions below accord to the term "deficit" its
normal and accepted meaning and are in harnlony with
this Court's decision in Continental Tie & L. Co. v. United
States, 286 U.S. 290.

BUTTE, A. & P. RY. v. U.S.

131

Argument for the United States.

More discrimination results from petitioner's construction than from the Government's.
The authoritative legislative history of § 204 does not
support the view that Congress intended to compensate
not only carriers which had deficits but also those which
had merely a diminished income during federal control.
The courts were not bound by the Commission's interpretation; they had jurisdiction to construe the statute
and determine whether the payment was within the Commission's authority. Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United
States, 164 U.S. 190, 210; Grand Trunk Westeri Ry. Co.
v. United States, 252 U.S. 112; United States v. Burchard,
125 U.S. 176; Burnet v. Porter, 283 U.S. 230. These decisions foreclose all questions with respect to the right
of the Government to recover a payment resulting from
an erroneous conclusion by its agent as to the legal effect
of the particular statute under, or in reference to which,
he is proceeding.
Manifestly, the power to construe the statute and determine whether it authorized the payment to.petitioner
was either in the courts or in the Commission. If we
should be wrong in the view that the courts had such
power, -then we contend that the Commission was empowered to reconsider and correct its first decision; and
that if, as petitioner argues, the Commission had exclusive
power to construe the statute, the courts must be bound
by its final decision. The Commission has consistently
exercised the power to reopen and correct its decisions with
respect to claims under §§ 204 and 209. If the Commission's jurisdiction was exhausted by its first and unauthorized action, and if that action also was conclusive
upon the courts, then the Government is left in the
anomalous position of possessing the right to recover an
unauthorized payment, but with an absolute denial of its
right to recover for lack of a forum.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

The question whether a particular carrier was within
the purview of the section is purely judicial, for that question is fundamental or " jurisdictional." Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 54 et seq. In this case the Commission
was not exercising its power as an agency of Congress to
regulate commerce Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United
States, 277 U.S. 172, 180.
The decision below, therefore, is not in conflict with
Work v. Rives, 267 U.S. 175, or other decisions construing
the Dent Act prior to amendment, because that Act then
expressly declared that the decision of the Secretary of the
Interior was "conclusive and final." Nor is there conflict
between the decision below and the decision in Great
Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, supra, or United
States v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 287 U.S. 144. Distinguishing: United States v. Ferreira,13 How. 39; United
States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691; United States v. Wildcat,

Recovery may not be denied on the grounds (1) that
petitioner is entitled to retain the money ex aequo et bono,
or (2) that the payment was a compromise.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This action was brought by the United States, on August 23, 1929, in the federal court for Montana to recover the sum of $487,116.31 paid to Butte, Anaconda &
Pacific Railway Company on March 26, 1925. The payment was made pursuant to a certificate of the Interstate
Commerce Commission for that amount, issued March 20,
1925, and addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Deficit Settlement with Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Ry.,

Comptroller-General his certificate approving the payment, issued a warrant for that sum and transmitted it

to the Treasurer of the United States. The Treasurer
paid the Railway.
The proceeding before the Commission originated in a
claim for $600,527.35 filed with it by the Railway under
§ 204 of Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 460, entitled
"Reimbursement of Deficits during Federal Control."'
Upon due hearing, the Commission concluded that the
Railway was entitled to $487,116.31; and it offered to issue
a certificate for that amount on condition that the Railway
sign a release accepting the amount "in settlement of all
claims against the Government under said section 204."
This condition was agreed to. About two years after the
money received had been disbursed by the Railway,
partly in dividends to stockholders, partly in the expenses of operation, the Commission issued an order purporting to reopen the proceeding; and set a hearing "for
the purpose of affording the Railway opportunity to show
cause why the certificate issued on March 20, 1925, should
not be revoked and its claim dismissed." The Railway,
appearing specially, protested against the action of the
Commission in attempting to reopen the proceeding; and
challenged its power to do so. On March 7, 1927, the
Commission entered an order purporting to cancel the
certificate of March 20, 1925, and to dismiss the Railway's
claim. Deficit Settlement with Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Ry., 117 I.C.C. 780. On June 8, 1928, the UnderSecretary of the Treasury demanded of the Railway repayment of the $487,116.31 received by it. Repayment
was refused. Fourteen months later, this action was
begun to recover the money.

from December 28, 1917 to March 1, 1920, during which the possession, use, control and operation of railroads and systems of transportation were taken over or assumed by the President. Proclamation

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

290 US.

The case was first heard upon defendant's demurrer to
the complaint. That demurrer was overruled. The defendant set up by answer the terms on which the payment
had been made and the disposition of the money received. Then the case was heard upon the plaintiff's
demurrer to the answer; that demurrer was sustained;
and judgment for the Government was entered in the
sum of $487,116.31 with interest at 8 per cent. from the
date of the demand and costs. The Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment. 61 F. (2d) 587. This
Court granted certiorari, 289 U.S. 717.
The action is brought to recover money paid by mistake. The charge is that the money was paid, because,
in 1925, the officials misconstrued the word " deficit," so
as improperly to extend the scope of § 204. That is a
charge, 'not of mistake but of error of judgment-a judgment necessarily exercised in the performance of theduties of office. Neither the Commission in issuing the
certificate, nor the Secretary of the Treasury, the Comptroller-General or the Treasurer when co-operating to
make the payment, labored under any mistake of fact;
or overlooked' any applicable rule of law; or was guilty of
any irregularity in proceeding. Moreover, if the word
"deficit" was misconstrued, the error was not due to
inadvertence. Ever since the enactment of Transportation Act, 1920, it had been recognized that the construction
to be given the word " deficit" presented a difficult and
important question. In 1920, before hearing those interested, the Commission attributed to the word the
.meaning now contended for by the Government. Protests against its then interpretation led the Commission to
set, in 1921, a public hearing for.the consideration solely
of that question.2 Counsel for many railroads participated and submitted briefs. On February 7, 1922, the

Commission stated its conclusion in an elaborate report.
In the Matter of the Construction of the Word "Deficit"
as Used in Paragraph (a) of Section 204 of the Transportation Act, 1920, 66 I.C.C. 765. The rule there announced was consistently acted upon for over two years
and a half. Under it, the Commission issued certificates
to 71 carriers, including that here attacked.8 Then there
was a change in the membership of the Commission. On
October 17, 1925, it overruled, in Deficit Status of Bingham & Garfield Ry. Co., 99 I.C.C. 724, its earlier decision; and in March, 1927, instituted against Butte,
Anaconda & Pacific Railway Company the proceeding to
revoke the certificate on which payment had already been
made.

Obviously, "Mistake

....

there was none, but

merely a revision of judgment in respect of matters of
opinion." United States v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 287
U.S. 144, 151.
The United States claims that the money can be recovered because it was a disbursement made without the
authority of Congress. The argument is that the Commission had no authority to issue a certificate, and the
financial -officers of the Government had no authority to
pay money, except to a carrier which had suffered a
"deficit " in operations during the period of Federal control; that, properly construing that word, the Railway had
not suffered a "deficit "; and that, having received the
money which the officials were not authorized to pay, the
Railway must restore it, since in dealings with the Government one is bound, at his peril, to know the limits of
the authority of its agents. We have no occasion to
determine which of the Commission's interpretations of
the W~ord "deficit" is the correct one. For we are of

opinion that the Government cannot recover the money
paid in 1925, even if the Commission erred in attributing to the word " deficit" the meaning then acted on.
The decision was on the merits. The case is no different than it would have been, if the Commission had erred
in any other ruling on a matter of law; or in a finding
strictly of fact; or in some finding as to maintenance,
depreciation or value-determinations called findings of
fact but which rest largely in opinion. In making those
decisions the Commission would necessarily act in a quasijudicial capacity. If it misconstrued the term "deficit,"
it committed an error; but it did not transcend its jurisdiction. Since Congress has not provided a method of
review, neither the Commission nor a court has power
to correct the alleged- error after payment made pursuant
to a certificate. The Government cannot recover, because
when Congress, by § 204, imposed the duty. to certify to
the Treasury the amounts severally due to carriers, it
required the Commission-and hence authorized it-to
determine whether the claimant was entitled to relief.
In making its determinations the Commission was required to decide many things besides the meaning of the
term " deficit" or the amount thereof, if any. To appreciate the broad scope of the Commission's duty, we must
consider the occasion and the character of the legislation
and the precise question of construction here involved.
On December 28, 1917, the President took possession and
assumed control of all the railroads in the United States.
By the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, 40 Stat. 451,
Congress provided for compensation equal to the "average annual railway operating income for the three years
ended" June 30, 1917, called the "test period." I Later,
'By the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, 40 Stat. 451, Congress authorized the President to agree with the several carriers that
compensation for the period of Federal control shall be paid at a
rate equal to their annual railway operating income for the three

Opinion of the Court.

the Director-General surrendered the possession and control of many short-lines. Their owners operated them
thereafter privately during some part of the period of
Federal control. These owners claimed that such private
operation had resulted in heavy losses attributable to the
continued Federal control of the main transportation systems of the country. They urged upon Congress that the
surrendered short-lines ought to be put into a good a
position financially as they would have been in, if the
Director General had retained 'ossession of them throughout the period of Federal control. Recognizing that
they had suffered, Congress included in Transportation
Act, 1920, the provision for compensation contained in
§ 204. Paragraph (a) describes the carriers entitled to
compensation:
"The term 'carrier' means a carrier by railroad which,
during the period of Federal control, engaged as a common carrier in general transpprtation, and competed for
traffic, or connected, with a railroad under Federal control, and which sustained a deficit in its railway operating income for that portion (as a whole) of the period
of Federal control during which it operated its own railroad or system of transportation; but does not include
any street or interurban electric railway which has as its
principal source of operating revenue urban, suburban,
or interurban passenger traffic or sale of power; heat, and
light, or both;

. .

Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) direct the Commission
to ascertain the data from which the amount of deficits
or losses are to be calculated; paragraph (f) fixes the
amounts payable; and paragraph (g) provides:
"The Commission shall promptly certify to the Secre-tary of the Treasury the several amounts payable to caryears ended June 30, 1917-called the "test period." Section 204
provided for determining similarly the amount of the deficit [or
losses] payable by reference to such ."test period."

riers under paragraph (f). The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed thereupon to draw
warrants in favor of each such carrier upon the Treasury
of the United States for the amount shown in such certificate as payable thereto. An amount sufficient to pay
such warrants is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated."
Claims under § 204 were filed by 461 carriers.' Each
The
claimant insisted that it had suffered a "deficit."
controverted question of construction discussed in this
case is whether, by the use of the word "deficit," Congress intended that compensation should be paid to those
carriers only which had suffered an actual [red-ink] loss
in operation, or intended to put all the short-lines into
as good a position as they would have been in if the
Director General had retained possession throughout Federal control. If " deficit " be held to mean actual loss
in operation, many of these carriers would receive nothing,
as they had earned net income, although at a rate less
than during the "test period." But it might prove upon
investigation of the accounts that some carriers who had
vainly claimed compensation on the basis of lessened
income as compared with the "test period" were entitled
to compensation because they had actually suffered a
[red-ink] loss in operation. Compare Deficit Status of
Fairport, Painesville & Eastern R. Co., 124 I.C.C. 323,
145 I.C.C. 684. This is true, because, while on the face
of the accounts there appeared to have been net income,
it might prove that there was, during the period, an
operating loss, by reason of the fact that the carrier had
failed to make the proper maintenance and depreciation
charges. Where the right to compensation depends upon
the propriety of the maintenance and depreciation
'Annual Report of Interstate Commerce Commission for 1929,
p. 11.

Opinion of the Court.

charges, it may be impossible to determine, until the
completion of the investigation into the accounts, whether
the carrier is entitled to relief. Compare Great Northern
Ry. Co. v. United States, 277 U.S. 172; Continental Tie
& Lumber Co. v. United States, 286 U.S. 290r; Great
Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 287 U.S. 144.
On the other hand, many a carrier may be denied compensation although" the fact is unquestioned that a [redink] operating loss had been suffered. Such denial has
been based sometimes on failure to prove other essential
facts; sometimes because of a ruling on matter of law.
The Commission has been required, in passing upon claims
under § 204, to decide, in addition to the meaning of the
word "deficit," many controlling questions of statutory
construction which in a sense are preliminary. Among
them are: What did Congress mean by the phrase "in
general transportation" ? ' What did Congress mean by
the phrase "compete for traffic . . . with a railroad under
Federal control" ? ' What did Congress mean by the
phrase "connected with a railroad under Federal con'In Deficit Claim of Manitou & Pike's'Peak Ry., 79 I.C.C. 1;

1, it was held the term had a broader significance than " common
carrier "; that it meant a carrier which might be utilized by the
Government in the prosecution of the War; that, by this term, Congress intended to differentiate between railroads (common carriers)
with reference to their utility and necessity as a part of the transportation system of the country; and that freight transportation,
rather than passenger transportation, was considered a test of this
utility and necessity. The claims were dismissed because these carriers did not meet the test erected.

the claim was dismissed, among other reasons, because it was not

or the Federal control of the main lines of transporta-tion? 15 Did Congress intend that a railroad technically
under Federal control, but which actually was operated
by its owners, should receive compensation under § 204? 18
While § 204 granted a bounty, it conferred a right, and
constituted the Commission a quasi-judicial tribunal to
adjudicate claims thereunder. Thus it was called upon
to pronounce a formal judgment on rights asserted. A
decision adverse to the carrier on any one of the suggested
questions of construction might compel dismissal of the
claim; "' thus relieving the Commission of the necessity
of enquiring whether a deficit had been suffered. But it
does not follow that such a decision would determine an
issue of jurisdiction. Under this legislation, whether a

compel it to proceed with the enquiry. See Abilene &

Under § 204, the Commission exercises functions
broader than those customarily conferred upon auditing
or disbursing officers. It sits as a special tribunal to hear
and determine the claims presented. Compare Work v.
Rives, 267 U.S. 175, 182; Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
United States, 277 U.S. 172, 182. It renders a judgment
upon a full hearing. In deciding any one of the enumerated questions of construction, as in other rulings of
law or findings of fact, the Commission may err. The victim of the error may be either the carrier or the Government. Although the decision on the question of construction be favorable to the carrier, it may still fail to secure
compensation, because there was, in fact, no deficit, whatever meaning be given to that word. On the other hand,
an erroneous decision in favor of the carrier, on any of
those questions, may result in the issue of a certificate
and the payment thereunder of money which stould not,
and but for the error would not, be made. Since authority to pass upon the meaning of the word "deficit," and

upon each of the other questions of construction, is essential to the performance of the duty imposed upon the
Commission, and Congress did not provide a method of
review, we hold that it intended to leave the Government,
as well as the carrier, remediless whether the error be one
of fact or of law. Compare UnitedStates v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 287 U.S. 144. The rule declared in Wisconsin Central R. Co. v. United States, 164 U.S. 190; Grand
Trunk Western Ry. Co. v. United States, 252 U.S. 112,
is not applicable here. The decision in Continental Tie
& Lumber Co. v. United States, 286 U.S. 290, is not inconsistent with this view.

FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 44.

Argued October 20, 1933.-Decided November 20, 1933.

1. Where by state statute, with reference to which a bank and its
depositors presumably contracted, the bank is held only to the
exercise of due diligence in forwarding checks for collection, and
its liability is conditioned on receipt of final payment from the collecting bank, thus making the relation between bank and depositor
(until final payment is received) one of agency merely, the depositors have a right of action against the collecting bank for any
default in collection or remittance. P. 146.
2. Upon the record in this case, held that a bank to which checks
were forwarded by another for collection stood in the relation of
agent to the depositors of the individual items in the forwarding
bank, and was liable to them for failure to remit cash or its equivalent in satisfaction of the amounts collected. P. 147.
3. A. bank against which an action is brought to recover a debt owed
by it individually' to the plaintiff bank held not entitled to set
off a demand which it asserts in an agency capacity. P. 148.
4. Where, at the time of the insolvency of a collecting bank, which
had sent drafts to a forwarding bank in settlement for items
collected by it, the collecting bank remained liable as sub-agent
