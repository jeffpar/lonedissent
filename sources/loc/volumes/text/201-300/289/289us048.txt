Their standing for that purpose, at least in the state
courts, is a question of state practice (Columbus & Greenville Ry. Co. v. Miller, 283 U.S. 96, 99; Braxton County

ILLINOIS v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CUSTOMS AND PATENT APPEALS

No. 538.

Argued February 17, 1933.-Decided March 20, 1933

1. The power of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations

is plenary and exclusive, not subject in its exercise to be limited,
qualified or impeded to any extent by state action. P. 56.
2. This power is buttressed by the express provision of the Constitution denying to the States authority to lay duties on imports or
exports without the consent of Congress. P. 57.
3. Although the taxing power is a distinct power and embraces the
power to lay duties, it is established that duties may also be
imposed in'the exercise of the power to regulate commerce. P. 58.
4. Where Congress exercises its power to regulate foreign commerce
by means of a tariff, declaring, as in the Tariff Act of 1922, that
it is so exercising it, the judicial department may not attempt, in
its own conception of policy, to distribute the duties thus fixed, by
allocating some of them to the exercise of the bower to regulate
commerce and others to an independent exercise of the taxing
power. P. 58.

The Tariff Act is a revenue measure in the constitutional sense, notwithstanding its provisions are so adjusted as to have a regulatory effect on commerce.
Hampton & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 411.
The intent of Congress in arranging the schedules of
customs duties may have been to encourage--to regulate-certain industries within certain States, a purpose,
which, if primary and "shown upon the face of the Act"
(Drexel Furniture Co. v. Bailey, 259 U.S. .20, 43) would
have been beyond the power of Congress; nevertheless,
the Act is constitutional because the primary purpose-'
in the constitutional sense-is revenue, although the desired and undisclosed economic results lie within a field
beyond the power of Congress to enter. Hampton & Co.

Regulations under the commerce clause (Art. I, ยง 8,

Clark DistillingCo. v. Western Missouri Ry. Co., 242 U.S.
311, 327; Alaska v. Troy, 258 U.S. 101. Customs duties
and excises must be uniform. Art. I, ยง 8, par. 1. If the
position of the lower court be sound, customs duties miglt
be one thing at the port of Los Angeles and another for
that of San Francisco, etc., and they would be sustained
on the claim that they were assessed under the clause to
regulate commerce, which does not require uniformity.
Congress obviously can not play ducks and drakes with
these constitutional powers. The -Act under which the
duty. challenged is levied is, in general, a revenue act, and
the particular: paragraphs clearly arerevenue provisions.

BOARD OF TRUSTEES v. U.S.

Argument for Petitioner.

When Congress enacts a law providing for import duties, it is exerting the taxing power, and not its power over
commerce. This was settled as early as Gibbonsv. Ogden,
9 Wheat. 1, 199, where Chief Justice Marshall says that
the act of laying customs duties is an exertion of a" branch
of the taxing power." To the same effect, see State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, and Hampton & Co. v.
United States, 276 U.S. 394.
The power over commerce is subject to certain constitutional limitations. it is no more complete than the
power to tax. Drexel Furniture Co. v. Bailey, 259 U.S.
20. It may not be so exerted as directly and substantially
to burden or embarrass the States in the exercise of
strictly governmental activities. Adair v. United States,
208 U.S. 161.
This Court, even when speaking of a power so vital to
the very.existence of the Nation as is that of taxation, has
always made it plain that there is little room for the concept of arbitrary power in our constitutional scheme.
Veazie Bank v. Fenno,8 Wall. 533, 541.
The grant of power over interstate and foreign commerce is in the same terms, "and the two powers are undoubtedly of the same class and character and equally
extensive," Bowman v. Chicago Ry. Co., 125 U.S. 465,
482; and "the power of Congress over interstate commerce is as absolute as its power over foreign commerce"
under the commerce clause. Brown v. Houston, 114 U.S.
622, 630; Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47, 56.
The lower court seems to assume that the power to
declare an embargo-Justice Story said that ". . . the
embargo . . " stands on the extreme verge of the Con-

stitution," Story, 1, 185, Autobiographical Sketch, 1831is sustainable exclusively under the commerce clause,
whereas its validity rests more logically on the doctrine
of "resulting powers" (resulting or implied from a num-

ber of enumerated powers), adverted to by Justice Story
in his Commentaries on the Constitution, Book III, Chap.
XXIV, but to be carefully differentiated from the concept
of inherent powers derived from the notion of "inherent
sovereignty."
If the commerce clause gives Congress power to levy
customs duties, it must also imply a power to levy excise
taxes on interstate commerce, a proposition'which we
deny in toto. The anomaly of denying Congress the
power to authorize a tax on the sale of a motorcycle to
a city for a policeman's use (Indian Motocycle Co. v.
United States, 283 U.S. 570) as a direct and unconstitutional burden on a strictly governmental instrumentality,
and permitting such a direct burden when imposed in
the assumed exercise of the power over commerce, seems
to have
the notice of the lower court.
If theescaped
power to levy the duty challenged is neither
an
express nor an implied power, it can not be sustained
as an exercise of an inherent power. Kansas v. Colorado,
206 U.S. 46.
Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General Lawrence and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold were
on the brief, for the United States.
The power of Congress over foreign commerce is not
subject to any implied linmitation in favor of tho States.
It includes the power to impose a protective tariff, and
the States are not exempt from the payment of duties
unless Congress so declares. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat.
1, 193, 196-197.
Although later decisions have shown thqt the power
of Congress over interstate commerce is subject to some
limitations (see Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251),
these limitations do not extend to the power to regulate
commerce with foreign nations and with the Indian
tribes. See Fuller, C.J., dissenting in the Lottery Case,

Congress may exercise this plenary power over foreign
commerce for the encouragement and protection of American industries, and this purpose may be accomplished
by levying duties upon the products of foreign countries
not for the sake of revenue but to exclude from our
markets the competition of foreign goods. Hampton &
Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 411. Cf. Alaska Fish
Co. v. Smith, 255 U.S. 44, 48; 1 Stanwood, American

Mich.L.J. 348; 2 Willoughby, Const. Law, 680.
The grant of power to Congress to impose a protective
tariff would be largely futile if the States might import
from abroad as they chose. South Carolina v. United
States, 199 U.S. 437.
It is established by Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533,
that regulation may take the form of taxation. See also
Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596; 2 Story, Commentaries, ยงยง 1080, 1081, 1088.
That the regulation is valid although it takes the form
of a tax seems necessarily to follow from the decisions
holding that the power to regulate foreign commerce' in-

cludes the power to prohibit the importation of any
article. Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U.S. 470; Brolan v.
United States, 236 U.S. 216; Weber-v. Freed, 239 U.S. 325.
At an early date, the power of Congress to regulate foreign commerce was exercised by a complete embargo on
all foreign commerce. Act of December 22, 1807, c. 5,
2 Stat. 451, as supplemented by the Act of January 9,
1808, c. 8, 2 Stat. 453. The statute was sustained in
United States v. The Brig William, 2 Hall Law J. 255,
Fed. Cas. No. 16700. See 2 Story, Commentaries,
ยงยง 1290, 1292; Kent's Commentaries, 431-432. This
power has been exercised in many subsequent Acts, including ยง ยง 305, 306, and 307 of the Tariff Act of 1922.
The States reserved no power with reference to the
importation of merchandise, and none may be implied in
derogation of the constitutional power of Congress. The
Constitution not only expressly gives to Congress the
power to lay and collect duties and imposts (Art: I, ยง 8,
par. 1), but the States are expressly forbidden to "lay
any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports," with the
exceptions which are not material here (Art. I, ยง 10,

par. 2).
The plenary power to regulate foreign commerce, including the power to prohibit as well as to tax, if exercised without discrimination may not be challenged, as
destructive of the States and their instrumentalities .of
government.
Further support for the correctness of these conclusions
is found, we believe, in (1) ,the long, continued practical
construction of the Constitution with respect to the power
of Congress to collect duties on state imports, (2) by the
analogy of decisions under other clauses of the Constitution, and (3) by considerations derived from this Court's
decision in South Carolinav. United States, 199 U.S. 437.
See Little v. United States, 104 Fed. 540; University of

Kastor & Bros. 6 Ct. Cust. App. 52. See also 21 Op.A.G.
301.
It has been the uniform practice of the Treasury for a
great many years not to exempt imports-by States or state
instrumentalities if they were otherwise taxable under the
Tariff Acts. It appears that for 135 years after the
adoption of the Constitution the officials of the States did
not question the power of Congress to impose duties on
their imports, and did not even think the matter doubtful
enough to warrant an application to the Treasury for a
ruling. The earliest published ruling is in 48 T.D.
728 (1925).
It seems to be well settled that a State engaging in commerce is not exempt from the regulatory power 6f Congress. South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437,
454; Georgia v. Chattanooga,264 U.S. 472, 481; McCallum v. United States, 298 Fed. 373, cert. den., 266 U.S.
606; Tilden v. United States, 21 F. (2d) 967; Mathewes v.
Port Utilities Comm'n, 32 F. (2d) 913. Cf. Sherman v.
United States, 282 U.S. 25.
State or municipally-owned railroads have often submitted to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce
Commission without question.
Another example of this practical construction of the
commerce clause appears in the Act of February 17, 1917,
c. 84, 39 Stat. 922 (U.S.C., Title 49, ยง 53), allowing the
issuance of passes to the trustees, officers, and agents of
a railroad owned by a State. Also the Act of January
19, 1929, c. 79, 45 Stat. (U.S.C. Supp. VI, Title 49,

Messrs. William A. Schnader, Attorney General of
Pennsylvania, and William A. Stevens, Attorney General
of New Jersey, by leave of Court, filed a brief as amici

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The University of Illinois imported scientific apparatus
for use in one of its educational departments. Customs
duties were exacted at the rates prescribed by the Tariff
Act of 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858. The University paid
under protest, insisting that as an instrumentality of the
State of Illinois, and discharging a governmental function, it was entitled to import the articles duty free. At
the hearing on the protest, the Customs Court decided
in favor of the Government (59 Treas. Dec. 747) and the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals affirmed the
decision. 61 Treas. Dec. 1334. This Court granted
certiorari. 28 U.S.C. ยง308; 287 U.S. 596.
The Tariff Act of 1922 is entitled-"An Act to provide
revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to
encourage the industries of the United States, and for
other purposes." The Congress thus asserted that it was
exeroising its constitutional authority "to regulate commerce with foreign nations." Art. I, ยง 8, par. 3. The
words of the Constitution "comprehend every species of
commercial intercourse between the United States and
foreign nations. No sort of tr -ie can be carried on between this country and any other, to which this power
does not extend." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 193. It
is an essential attribute of the power that it is exclusive
and plenary. As an exclusive power, its exercise may not

be limited, qualified or impeded to any extent by state
action. Id. pp. 196-200; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat
419, 446; Alihy v. California,24 How. 169, 173; Buttfield
v. Stranahan, 192 U.S. 470, 492, 493. The power is
buttressed by the express provision of the Constitution
denying to the States authority to lay imposts or duties on
imports or exports without the consent of the Congress.
Art. I, ยง 10, -par. 2.
The Congress may determine what articles may be imported into this country and the terms upon which importation is permitted. No one can be said to have a vested
right, to carry on foreign commerce with the United States.
Buttfield v. Stranahan,supra; The Abby Dodge, 223 U.S.
166, 176, 177; Brolan v. United States, 236 U.S. 216, 218,
219; Weber v. Freed, 239 U.S. 325, 329, 330. If the Con-.
gress saw fit to lay an embargo or to prohibit altogether
the importation of specified articles, as the Congress may
(The Brigantine William, 2 Hall's Amer.L.J., 255; Fed.
Cas. No. 16700; Gibbons v. Ogden supra, pp. 192, 193;
Brolan v. United States, supra; Weber v. Freed, supra;
Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S.
427, 434), no State by virtue of any interest of its own
would be entitled to override the restriction. The principle of duality in our system of government does not
touch the authority of the Congress in the regulation of
foreign commerce.
Appellant argues that the Tariff Act is a revenue measure; that it is not the less so because it is framed with a
view, as its title states, of encouraging the industries of
the United States (Hampton & Co. v. United States, 276
U.S. 394; 411, 412); that the duty is a tax, that the Act
is not one for the regulation of commerce but is an exertion of the taxing power, and that, as such, it is subject
to the constitutional limitation that the Congress may not
lay a tax so as to impose a direct burden upon an instru-

mentality of a State used in the performance of a governmental function.,
It is true that the taxing power is a distinct power; that
it is distinct from the power to regulate commerce. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra,p. 201. It is also true that the taxing power embraces the power to lay duties. Art. I, ยง 8,
par. 1.- But because the taxing power is a distinct power
and embraces the power to lay duties, it does not follow
that duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the
power to regulate commerce. The contrary is well established. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, p. 202. "Under the
power to regulate foreign commerce Congress impose
duties on importations, give drawbacks, pass embargo, and
non-intercourse laws, and make all other regulations necessary to navigation, to the safety of passengers, and the
protection of property." Groves v. Slaughter,15 Pet. 449,
505. The laying of duties is "a common means of executing the power." 2 Story on the Constitution, ยง 1088. It
has.not been questioned that this power may be exerted
by laying duties "to countervail the regulations and restrictions of foreign nations." Id., ยง 1087. And the Congress may, and undoubtedly does, in its tariff legislation
consider the conditions of foreign trade in all its aspects
and effects. Its requirements are not the less regulatory
because they are not prohibitory or retaliatory. They embody the congressional conception of the extent to which
regulation should go. But if the Congress may thus exercise the power, and asserts, as it has asserted here, that it
is exercising it, the judicial department may not attempt
in its own conception of policy to distribute the duties
thus fixed by allocating some of them to the exercise of
the admitted power to regulate commerce and others to
an independent exercise of the taxing power. The purpose to regulate foreign commerce permeates the entire
congressional plan. The revenue resulting from the duties

BOARD OF TRUSTEES v. U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

"is an inciddnt to such an exercise of the power. It flows
from, but does not create the power." Id.
The principle invoked by the petitioner, of the immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation, has
its inherent limitations. Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286
U.S. 123, 128. It is a principle implied from the necessity
of maintaining our dual system of government,. Collector
v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 127; Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U.S. 216,
225; Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U.S.
570, 575. Springing from that necessity it does not ex-.
tend beyond it. Protecting the functions of government
in its proper province, the implication ceases when the
boundary of that province is reached. The fact that the
State in the performance of state functions may use imported articles does not mean that the importation is. a
function of the state government independent of federal
power. The control of importation does not rest with
the State but with the Congress. In international relations and with respect to foreign .intercourse and trade
the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power.
There is thus no violation of the principle which petitioner invokes, for there is no .encroachment on the power
of the State as none exists with respect to the subject over
which the federal power has been exerted. To permit the
States and their instrumentalities to import commodities
for their own use, regardless of the requirements imposed
by the Congress, would undermine, if not destroy, the
single control which it was one of the dominant purposes
of the Constitution to create. It is for the Congress to
decide to what extent, if at all, the States and their
instrumentalities shall be relieved of the payment of
duties on imported articles.
The contention of the petitioner finds no support in
the history of tariff acts or in departmental practice. It is

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.

not necessary to review this practical construction. It
is sufficient to say that only in recent years has any

question been raised by state officials as to the authority
of Congress to impose duties upon their imports.

In view of these conclusions, we find it unnecessary to
consider the questions raised with respect to the particular
functions of the petitioner and its right to invoke -the
principle for which it contends.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA

No. 293.

Argued January 12, 1933.-Decided March 20, 1933

1. Where several suits were consolidated for trial and tried in a state
court, appealed to the state supreme court on a single transcript,
and there docketed and argued as one case and disposed of by a,
single written opinion,-held a complete consolidation reviewable
in this Court by a single appeal, although there was a separate
judgment for each suit in the trial court. P. 62.
2. A state law taxing all the property of banks that make loans
mainly from money of depositors; but exempting other competing
moneyed capital .employed in making loans mainly from money
supplied otherwise than by deposits, is consistent with the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 63.
3. To avoid a state tax on national bank shares under R.S., ยง 5219,
it is necessary to prove not only that the bank was authorized
to engage in, but that, during the tax year, its moneys were actually
and in substantial amount employed in, some line of business which
was then being carried on also by other and less heavily taxed
moneyed capital. So held where there was no reason to suppose
that national banks were prevented from competing by the tax
discrimination. P. 64.
4. The evidence in this case does not prove that the complaining
national banks were engaged in lending money on real estate
mortgages, or were in competition with "small loan" companies,
so-called Morris Plan and Morgan Plan companies, or automobile
