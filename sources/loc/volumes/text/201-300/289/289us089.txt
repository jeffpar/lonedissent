ROSSI

ET AL.

v. UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 594. Argued March 13, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933
1. Under §, 3266 R.S.; 26 U.S.C., § 291, a person may not register,
or have lawful custody or control of, a still set up in a dwelling
house for the manufacture of alcoholic spirits. P. 91.
2. In prosecutions for carrying on the business of a distiller without
giving bond and for having possession and control of a still not
registered, the failure to register and to give bond may be inferred
from proof that the still, in the custody and control of the defendants, was set up and operating, or ready to operate, in a dwelling
house. P. 90.
3. The burden of proof to show execution of a bond and registration
of the still was upon the defendants. Id.
4. It is not incumbent upon the prosecution to adduce positive evidence to support a negative averment, the truth of which is fairly
indicated by established circumstances and which if untrue could
be readily disproved by the production of documents or other
evidence probably within the defendants' possession or control.
P. 91.

ways. The third count charged them with carrying on
the business of a distiller without having given the bond
required by § 3260, Rev. Stats., U.S.C. Title 26, § 284.'
The fourth charged possession and control of a still not
registered as required by § 3258, Rev. Stats., U.S.C.
Title 26, § 281.2 They pleaded not guilty; waived a jury;
went to trial before the Judge. He found them guilty
under both the third -and fourth counts and imposed appropriate sentence.
The only point presented by the record for our consideration is whether there was adequate evidence to support the conviction.
There was enough to show that the petitioners had
custody and control of a still for the manufacture of
alcoholic spirits, set up and operating, or ready for operation, in a dwelling house. They did not take the stand;
no affirmative evidence of failure to register the still or
to give bond as required by the Revised Statutes' was
presented.
The United States claim that in such circumstances the
burden of proof to show execution of the bond and regis'SEc.

284. Every person intending to commence or to continue the

business of a distiller shall . . .before proceeding with such business ... execute a bond [with specified conditions] ....
Every
person who fails or refuses to give the bond hereinbefore required ...
shall forfeit the distillery, distilling apparatus, and all real estate and
premises connected therewith, and shall be fined not less than $500
nor more than $5,000, and imprisoned not less than six months nor
more than two years.
'SEc. 281. Every person having in his possession or custody, or
under his control, any still or distilling apparatus set up, shall register
the same . . . Stills and distilling apparatus shall be registered immediately upon their being set up .... And every person having
in his possession or custody, or under his control, any still or distilling
apparatus set up which is not so registered, shall pay a penalty of
$500, and shall be fined not less than $100, nor more than $1,000, and
imprisoned for not less than one month, nor more than two years.

ROSSI v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

tration of the still rested upon the petitioners; that having failed to sustain this, the Judge properly declared
them guilty as charged. And with this view we agree.
Section 3266, Rev. Stats., U.S.C. Title 26, § 291,
provides:
in any dwell"No person shall use any still ....
,ing house, or in any shed, yard, or inclosure connected
and every person
.
with any dwelling house .
who does any of the acts prohibited by this section, or
aids or assists therein, . . . shall be fined $1,000 and
imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than
two years, in the discretion of the court .......
It was impossible for the petitioners lawfully to register
the still or to give the required bond.
The lower federal courts generally have accepted the
doctrine that proof of the custody or control of a still
for unlawful distillation of alcoholic spirits is enough to
give rise to an inference of lack of registration qnd failure
to give bond which the defendant must overcome by
proof. Barton v. United States, 267 Fed. 174, 175;
McCurry v. United States, 281 Fed. 532, 533; Goodfriend
v. United States, 294 Fed. 148, 150; Giacolone v. United
States, 13 F. (2d) 108, 110; Seidenv. United States, 16 F.
(2d) 197, 199; Colasurdo v. United States, 22 F. (2d) 934,
935; Cardenti v. United States, 24 F. (2d) 782, 783;
Mangiaracina v. United States, 40 F. (2d) 164, 166;
Stark v. United States, 44 F. (2d) 946, 949, 950. And
see Faraonev. United States, 259 Fed. 507, 509; Sharp v.
United States, 280 Fed. 86, 89.
The general principle, and we think the correct one,
underlying the foregoing decisions is that it is not incumbent on the prosecution to adduce positive evidence to
support a negative averment the truth of which is fairly
indicated by established circumstances and which if untrue could be readily disproved by the production of doc-

uments or other evidence probably within the defendant's
possession or control. See Chamberlayne's Modern Law
of Evidence, Vol. 2, § 983; Greenleaf on Evidence, 16th
ed., Vol. 1, § 79, p. 154; Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S.
613, 619; Dunlop v. United States, 165 U.S. 486, 502, 503;
Mobile, J.& K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U.S. 35, 42;
Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 185.
The only decision called to our attention which seems
in conflict with those cited above is Mansbach v. United
States, 11 F. (2d) 221, 223, 224. And with the doctrine
there apparently approved, so far as in conflict with the
commonly accepted view, we cannot agree.

C. A. BRADLEY, DOING BUSINESS AS WOLVERINE MOTOR FREIGHT LINES, v. PUBLIC
UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT. OF OHIO

No. 395.

Argued January 20, 23, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933

1. A state commission, after full hearing, denied a certificate of
public convenience and necessity to operate by motor, as a common carrier of property, over a particular state highway to the
state line with final destination beyond in an adjacent State, upon
the ground that the route specified was already so badly congested
by motor traffic that the addition of the applicant's proposed
service would cause excessive hazard to the safety of travelers and
property upon that highway. The applicant, though at liberty to
do so, did not apply for another route; nor did he prove that none
other was feasible. Held, that the order was not void as an exclusion from interstate commerce. P. 94.
2. A state order denying a common carrier by motor a certificate to
engage in interstate commerce, when made to promote public safety
and because of highway congestion, is an exercise of the police
power, and its effect on interstate comnmerce is merely incidental.
P. 95.
3. In dealing with the problem of safety of the highways, as in other
problems of motor transportation, the State may adopt measures
