owned a pyrites mine. In 1918, it made extensive enlargements of its plant at the request of the Secretary of
the Interior. As hostilities ceased soon thereafter, the
undertaking resulted in a large loss. Prior to 1922, it
made applications for relief from the losses suffered.
These applications resulted in awards aggregating $737,765.24. Of this amount $223,529.17 was paid by the
Government on October 25, 1919 ;' $469,784.62 on October
5, 1922; and $44,451.45 on March 14, 1932.2
The demand now presented is for the further sum of
$514,276.43, alleged to have been due December 31, 1931;
and for additional amounts which cannot be stated definitely because they are accruing daily. These sums,
claimed as items of loss, represent interest paid or accrued
since March 2, 1919, on a contract to repay with interest
$645,000 borrowed by the Corporation in 1918, mainly in
order to pay fot enlarging the plant.3 In 1922, the Secretary had, in calculating losses suffered, refused to allow
any sum paid for interest on borrowed money. The Cor'
poration thereupon sought, by mandamus, to compel the
award of interest. In that proceeding this Court held, in
1925, that mandamus must be denied, because the Act
made the determination of the Secretary conclusive,'
Work v. U.S. ex rel. Chestatee Pyrites & Chemical Corp.,
'Since then two additional awards have been made to the Corporation, which are not directly involved in this case. On December 7,
1932, an award of $1,584.76 was made on account of taxes. And on
February 23, 1933, a further award of $90,500 was made by the Secretary pursuant to the decision in Wilbur v. US. ex rel. Chestatee
Pyrites & Chemical Corp., 288 U.S. 97. The Corporation has thus
received awards aggregating $829,850.
' The loans totaled $695,000; but it was found that "$50,000 of the
amount was loaned prior to stimulation."
' The Act declared in § 5: "The said Secretary shall make such
adjustments and payments in each case as he shall determine to be
just and equitable; that the decision of said Secretary shall be conelusive and final .... " 40 Stat. 1274.

267 U.S. 185. The proceeding at bar is a second petition
for mandamus, filed pursuant to an amendment of the
Act made February 13, 1929, c. 182, 45 Stat. 1166, which
authorized a claimant thereunder to "petition the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to review the
final decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon any
question of law which has arisen or may hereafter arise
in the adjustment, liquidation and payment of his claim
under said Act."
The Corporation sought in the second petition for
mandamus, as in the first, to compel the Secretary to consider, in determining the amount of net losses, interest
payable on borrowed money. The trial court denied the
mandamus. Its judgment was reversed by the District
Court of Appeals, 60 App. D.C. 62;. 47 F. (2d) 424; and
in sustaining the reversal, in Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Chestatee Pfrites & Chemical Corp., 284 U.S. 231, 237, 238,
we said: "The amount of interest that at the time of the
passage of the Relief Act, March 2, 1919, had been paid
or incurred by relator for money borrowed and lost in
producing and preparing to produce pyrites upon the
specified conditions is to be taken into account in determining the amount of its net loss as of that date." Thereupon, the Secretary made an award of $44,451.45, this
amount being, as stated by him, "the amount of interest
that at the time of the passage of the act of Congress of
March 2, 1919, had been paid on the obligations incurred
by the relator for money borrowed and lost in producing
and preparing to produce pyrites .,. . and for which
in justice and equity the relator was entitled to receive
reimbursement . . . "

The Corporation insists that there should, as stated,
be allowed,, as part of its net. loss, on account of interest
payable on borrowed money, the further sum of $524,276.43, and, also, additional amounts which can not be

definitely stated now. The $524,276.43 represents interest paid or accrued between March 2, 1919, and December
31, 1931, growing out of obligations for borrowed money
outstanding March 2, 1919. The claim for additional unascertained amounts represents the interest which has accrued on those obligations since December 31, 1931, plus
that which will accrue hereafter on such parts thereof
as may, from time to time, be outstanding. To enforce
this demand, the Corporation secured a rple upon the
Secretary to show cause why he had not complied with
the decree entered pursuant to our decision in the Wilbur
case. The Secretary averred that he had fully complied
therewith, by allowing all interest paid or accrued to
March 2, 1919; and that this was all the interest "for
which in justice and equity the relator was entitled to
receive reimbursement from the appropriation made by
Congress for the payment of such losses." The District
Court sustained the position of the Secretary. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District,
61 App. D.C. 324; 62 F. (2d) 863. This Court granted
certiorari, 288 U.S. 590. We think the District Court
was right.
First. The Corporation contends that in computing
losses which "have been suffered" as of March 2, 1919,
no distinction can be drawn between the principal of the
loan and the interest thereon; that as the amount of the
principal was included without question in ascertaining
the loss as of March 2, 1919, although the loan was not
then due, the amount of the interest should similarly be
included, whether it had been paid or had accrued as of
that date or had accrued later. The argument rests upon
a misconception.
Congress did not authorize or direct the Secretary of the
Interior to pay any loan of a claimant. Section 5 of
the War Minerals Relief Act, March 2, 1919, authorized

the Secretary to "adjust, liquidate, and pay such net
losses as have been suffered by any person, firm, or corporation, by reason of producing or preparing to produce
. . .pyrites .
in compliance with the request or
demand of the Department of the Interior . . . to supply the urgent needs of the Nation in the prosecution
of the war." I The $645,000 capital raised by the loan,
like some other capital of the Corporation, was wiped
out by the deficit in operation and the shrinkage of capital assets. And for the loss thus sustained the Corporation was reimbursed by the payments under the award
made. The cost to the Corporation of carrying the loan
after March 2, 1919, was not part of the net losses which
had "been suffered."
The method of determining the net losses in such businesses during a particular period, or in a particular adventure, is well settled.' The net losses consist of any
deficit from operations plus any shrinkage in value of
the plant investment. In calculating the loss for a period
it is immaterial whether items entered as operating expense or as investment have been paid or are still owed
for. If the capital employed by the Corporation during
the period, whether owned or borrowed, was sunk, its loss
"The section was amended November 23, 1921, c.137, 42 Stat. 322,
by adding "that all claimants ... shall be reimbursed such net
losses as they may have incurred and are in justice and equity entitled
to from the appropriation in said Act "; and "If in claims passed
upon under said Act [of March 2, 1919] awards have been denied or
made on rulings contrary to the provisions of this amendment, or
through miscalculations, the Secretary of the Interior may award
proper amounts or additional amounts."
'See, e.g., T. 0. McGrath, Mine Accounting and Cost Principles
(1921), pp. 147, 178-179; R. B.Kester, Accounting Theory and Practice (1918), pp. 487-488; H. A. Finney, Principles of 'Accounting
(1931), c.3, pp. 4-7; W. J. Graham and W. G.Katz, Accounting in
Law Pxactice (1932), pp. 27-33.

Opinion of the Court.

will necessarily be reflected either in the deficit from operations or in the shrinkage in value of the capital assets.
In calculating the operating deficit during the period
ending March 2, 1919, interest paid or accrued on the
borrowed capital was treated as an operating charge. Interest accruing thereafter on any loan then outstanding
is comparable to the cost of caring, after that date, for
property retained-or to a lessening, after that date, of the
value of that property. Such items enter into the determination of the losses of a later period; and with these
the Government has no concern. Hence, the Secretary
properly refused to consider interest accrued after March
2, 1919, in calculating losses during the period ending that
day.
Second. The Corporation insists that the Act should
be construed as requiring the Secretary to include as an
item in the loss suffered before March 2, 1919, all interest
thereafter accruing on an "obligation incurred" before
that date. It argues that a liberal construction of the
Act requires this conclusion, United States v. New York,
160 U.S. 598, 620, particularly in view of related legislation.' In support of that construction, it points to provisos of § 5 which declare (1) that "no claims shall be
allowed or paid" by the Secretary "unless it shall appear
to the satisfaction of the said Secretary that the expenditures so made or obligations so incurred were made in
good faith" and (2) "that moneys were invested or obligations were incurred subsequent to" April 6, 1917, and
'Act of October 5, 1918, c. 181, 40 Stat. 1009, entitled "An kc to
provide further for the national security and defense by encouraging,

the production, conserving the supply, and controlling the distribution
of those ores, metals, and minerals which have formerly been largely
imported, or of which there is or may be an inadequate supply ";
and Act of June 7, 1924, c. 327, 43 Stat. 634, which removed the limitation of $8,500,000 as the amount payable in the aggregate on claims
under the Act of March 2, 1919.

prior to November 11, 1918.' These provisos did not by
referring to obligations "incurred" enlarge the Secretary's authority to "pay such net losses as hive been suffered." On the contrary, their purpose was to make clear
that where expenditures were alleged, the Secretary must
be satisfied that payment therefor had actually been made
or that there was a valid agreement to pay therefor.
When this Court stated in the Wilbur case that in determining the loss as of March 2, 1919, there shall be
taken into account "the amount of interest which has
been paid or incurred by relator for money borrowed and
lost," the word "incurred" was used to mean interest
accrued on that date, as well as interest paid. The language of the opinion was correctly construed by the Secretary when he limited the additional award, on account
of interest, to $44,451.45.
