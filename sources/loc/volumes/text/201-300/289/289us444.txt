the award) an action in Tennessee to recover compensation under the Tennessee Act. The court held that by
bringing the Ohio proceedings the widow had renounced
her right under the Tennessee Act; and final judgment
was entered for the company shortly before the action at
bar was begun. The opinion states that the suit is one
upon contract; that "the sole defense interposed is the
proceedings in Ohio "; that the institution of the proceedings in Ohio "was a clear renunciation or disaffirmance
of the contract "; "that the election thus made was irrevocable, because the petitioner [Mrs. Tidwell] has taken
the benefit of the Ohio suit and the defendant [the Company] will doubtless take the detriment of that suit ";
and the court added: "Not prejudging another case, but
merely by way of answer to argument made in this case,
we may observe that defendant's way of escape from the
Ohio proceedings and award is not apparent, after the
pleading by the defendant of such proceeding and award
to defeat its liability herein." In view of this decision, we
have no occasion to consider differences in phraseology between the Tennessee statute and that of Vermont.

Mandamus is the proper remedy, and in this case the

statute, by its terms "permits" a cause
to be continued and maintained against the successor when he
consents, and when the suit hhs been brought against the
predecessor "as a public officer." It does not authorize
the court to compel even a federal officer to consent to
substitution, Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, 258 U.S. 537;
Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., 257 U.S. 1.
It is not to be assumed that the statute was intended
to impose obligations on state officers, since no such authority has been delegated to the Federal Government,
and it would be an invasion of the reserved power of the
States for the Federal Government to impose duties and
financial burdens on state officers.
The federal statute could not constitutionally authorize
the court to compel La Prade, as a state officer, to accept
substitution for Peterson because:
(a) Suit against La Prade as a state officer would be a
suit against the State 'in pontravention of the Eleventh
Amendment. Ex parte Ayers, 123 U.S. 443; Minnesota

(b) The Federal Governnent can not exercise the fe-served powers of the States by imposing duties and financial burdens on state officers.

Argument for Petitioner.

La Prade can not be made responsible for Peterson's
wrongdoing. Smietanka v. IndianaSteel Co., 257 U.S. 1;
United States v. Boutwell, supra.

The personal liability of Peterson as an individual defendant can not be shifted to La Prade. Gorham Mfg.
Co. v. Wendell, 261 U.S. 1.
La Prade can not be required to defend himself without
a complaint filed against him, a summons issued, or any
opportunity to plead or to present evidence in his own
behalf. The suit against Peterson can not be transformed
by a mere order of substitution into a suit against La
Prade. United States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall. 604; Richardson v. McChesney, 218 U.S. 487.
It is apparent that La Prade is not only required, by the
order in this case, to step into Peterson's shoes, to be
charged with the alleged wrongdoing of Peterson, but
he must undertake the financial burden of carrying on a
siit which, through its conduct by Peterson, carries with
it ultimate liability not only for the costs already incurred,
but also liability for the costs which the new defendant
must .incur, or else fail in his defense. Here is a case in
which over 8,000 pages of testimony have been taken; the
costs of a reference to master, approximating $15,000

have been incurred.
If all costs to the present time were disregarded, it
would be necessary for La Prade, as a substitute defendant, to subject himself to enormous costs which would be
required for an appeal to the Supreme Court from the
decision of the three-judge court.
Such substitution would not be "due process of law."

McInnis were on the brief, for respondents.
Petitioner's remedy was to appeal from the final decree,
entered before he filed his petition.
He should have remained and participated in the final
,hearing, and would not thereby have consented to the substitution, or added in the least to the power and jurisdiction of the District Court over him. Harkness v. Hyde,
98 U.S. 476, 479; Southern Pacifi Co.v. Denton, 146 U.S.

Court to decline, ,on this application, to consider the
jurisdict'on of the District Court. In re Chicago, R. I. &
P. Ry. Co., 255 U.S. 273.
The substitution statute vested discretionary. power in
the District Court to make the substitution order, and
unless the statute is invalid the order was proper.
Petitioner's contention that the statute only empowers
a court to permit and does not authprize a court to compel substitution does violence to its words. If any explanation of legislative intent were necessary, then the
statement of Mr. Justice Van Devanter at the hearing
before the Senate Committee (Hearing of Subcommittee
on Judiciary of Senate, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., on S.2061,
A Bill to Give the Supreme Court Authority to Make and
Publish Rules in Common Law Actions--Feb. 2, 1924),
that a successor sought to be substituted is "given opportunity to show cause, if he have any, why the substitution should not be made," and the statement in the House
Judiciary Report, H.Rep. No. 1075, 68th,Cong., p. 7, that
under the statute "new state, county, and city officers
may be substituted after notice to them and if such substitution is shown not to work them injustice," conclu-

sively negative petitioner's contention. Union Trust Co.
v. Wardell, 258 U.S. 537.
The substitution statute as applied here does not violate the Fifth, Tenth, or Eleventh Amendments. Congress has power by appropriate legislation to prevent the
invasion by States of the exclusive and occupied legislative field of Congress under the commerce clause, and to
prevent interstate commerce being unduly burdened, and
to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.
Because an action against an individual who is a state
officer, and which relates to the present or future discharge of his official duties, can be maintained only so
long as he is clothed with official authority to do the act
sought to be enjoined, it abates as soon as he ceases to
hold such office, unless there is a statute providing for the
substititibn of his successor. That is the obvious and
necessary purpose of the substitution statute. Such a defendant is not, because of that situation, sued in his official capacity or as a representative or agent of the State,
within the Eleventh Amendment cases. Nor are the
principles applicable that govern abatement of actions
against individuals; such as an action to enjoin a threatened trespass tortiousin character, -personal in nature and
not commanded by a state statute authorizing and requiring the trespass.
The purpose is, among other things, to provide for adjudication of donstitutional questions in the federal courts
in suits against officials relating to the present or future
discharge of their duties. Another purpose is to enable
the successors of the state offcials against whom final decrees have been entered to be .substituted and take or
carry on appeals.
While judicial power can only be exercised in a case or
controversy, its exercise is not confined to the forms of
procedure that existed in 1789.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Argument for Respondents.

289 U.S.

Congress is authorized by appropriate legislation to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, and to carry into effect
the power to regulate interstate commerce. The substitution statute is a valid exercise of that power.
Failure to appear would no more have affected the
power of the District Court to adjudicate the controversy
than failure of his predecessor to appear in response to
the original subpoena would have affected it.
If plaintiffs do not bring suits, and if defendants do not
defend suits or have not in advance by their conduct or
agreements become liable for costs, no costs can be
assessed against them.
The question of petitioner's liability for costs incurred
while his predecessor was the defendant of record is moot,
because the motion for leave to file petition was made on
March 13, 1933, after the filing on March 8, 1933, of final
decrees that adjudged that plaintiffs should collect no
costs from either petitioner or his predecessor.
In some of the cases holding there could be no substitfition without a statute providing therefor, lack of privity
is referred to. What this Court meant was that there was
not such privity as exists for example between a trustee
and his successor; that there was not such privity that the
action would survive in the absence of a statute so
providing.
There is ample relationship between petitioner and his
predecessor to sustain the substitution statute and the
action of the District Court thereunder.
The duty of petitioner is precisely the same as that of
his predecessor-to enforce the law unless competently
restrained. Neit&.er could disclaim that intention; nor is
a threat by either necessary to the jurisdiction.
When the official sued is under a statutory duty to
prosecute, that is sufficient for jurisdiction. Penn8ylvania
v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 592; Pierce v. Society, of
Sisters, 268 U. . 510; Williams v. Boynton, 147 N.Y. 426.

Opinion of the Court.

Section 3 of the Arizona Act specifically provides that
the penalties thereunder "shall be recovered and suits
therefor brought by the Attorney General, or under his
direction, in the name of the State." No discretion in
the matter is entrusted to the Attorney General.
The Legislature and the Attorney General are agents
of the State and capable of unlawful action; and the latter
is bound to obey the former.
The authorities almost unanimously hold that it is the
duty of an executive officer to comply with a state statute
until the courts declare it unconstitutional, unless he
would be under a personal liability if he complied and the
statute were afterwards annulled; and that in the absence of personal liability, the defense of unconstitutionality may not be raised in a mandamus proceeding by
any such officer. State ex rel. v. State Board, 84 Fla.
592; Harv. L.7Rev., June, 1929, p. 1071. See Columbus

258; and Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U.S. 14, 15.
The Fifth Amendment is not violated by the substitution.
The Arizona Train Limit Defense Statute and the acts
and agreements of the state officials thereunder constituted such a consent by the State to the hearing and
adjudication of the suits that petitioner is bound thereby.

prayed should not be granted, assigned the case for argument, directed briefs to be filed on or before the day set,
stayed proceedings against petitioner, and directed the
district court to continue its term pending the final determination of petitioner's application. The judges made
their return to the rule. On the appointed day, there
being no material controversy as to controlling facts, we
heard oral arguments upon the -merits.

facts on which it claims that enforcement of the statute

by or against a state officer is pending in a federal court
at the time of his separation from his office, the court
may permit the cause to be continued and maintained by
or against such officer's successor if within six months it
be satisfactorily shown that there is a substantial need
for so continuing and maintaining the cause and obtaining
an adjudication of the questions involved. The section
requires that the officer, unless expressly consenting
thereto, be given reasonable notice of the application and
an opportunity to present any -objectiofi which he may
have. As grounds for the substitution, plaintiffs' application merely stated that each suit relates to the future discharge of the official duties of the Attorney General of
Arizona and, following the language of the statute, that
there is a substantial need for continuing and maintaining
it alid obtaining adjudication of the questions involved.
Plaintiffs, at the appointed time and place, applied to
the court for the order of substitution. The petitioner
appeared specially and objected. He insisted that, each
of the suits being against his predecessor individually,
the questions involved became moot upon the expiration
of the latter's term of office; that, there being no pleading
pending, whether the court be one of first instance or an appellate
tribunal, to permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or
against the successor in office of such officer, if within six, months
after his death or separation from the office it be satisfactorily shown
to the court that there is a substantial need for so continuing and
maintaining the cause and obtaining an adjudication of the questions
involved.

or separation from the office.

opportunity to present any objection which he may have.

dharging him with having threatened to enforce the state
enactment, there was no cause of action against him; that
he could not be held for the costs theretofore incurred,
and that the suits should be dismissed. After hearing
the parties, the court by an order merely containing a recital in the general words of the statute as to the need
for continuing the suits, made the petitioner defendant
in each case.
Promptly, upon somewhat amplified grounds, he filed a
motion that the cases be dismissed. The court denied the
motion. Petitioner and his counsel declined to participate in further proceedings in the case. The court heard
plantiffs orally and, March 8, 1933, filed its opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered decrees
adjudging the statute unconstitutional and enjoining petitioner. It declared that no costs up to and including the
entry of the final decree should be assessed against petitioner or his predecessor. The opinion, 2 F. Supp. 855,
construes the statute to impose the duty of enforcement
upon each succeeding attorney general and declares that,
as long as there is an attorney general in the State, the
threat of prosecution is always present and the resulting
injury, if any, always impends.
The injunctions sought are not aimed at the State or
the office of attorney general or to restrain exertion of
any authority that belongs to either. Each complaint
-charges that, because of a void enactment and the purpose of defendant under color of his office to enforce it by
means of suits which it purports to authorize, plaintiff is
prevented from operating trains that are of suitable size
and necessary for the proper conduct of the transportation
business, and so continuously suffers great and irreparable
injury. The suits were brought against defendant, not
as a representative of the State, but to restrain him individually from, as it is alleged, wrongfully subjecting plaintiff to such unauthorized prosecutions. In Ex parte

Young, 209 U.S. 123, the court said (p. 159): "The Act
to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional, and if it
be so, the use of the name of the State to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury of complainants is a proceeding without the authority of and one which does not
affect the State in its sovereign or governmental capacity.
It is simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official
in attempting by the use of the name of the State to
enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional. If the act which the state Attorney General
seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federal Constitution,
the officer in proceeding under such enactment comes into
conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution,
and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct." The principle there
stated has since been applied in numerous decisions here.
See e.g., Hopkins v. Clemson College, 221 U.S. 636, 642
et seq. Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 37. Terrace v.
Thompson, 263 U.S. 197, 214. Sterling v. Constantin,

The laws of Arizona do not authorize substitution of
petitioner for his predecessor. See Irwin v. Wright, 258
U.S. 219, 222. The suits abated whep defendant Peterson ceased to be attorney general. And unless empowered
by ยง 780, the district court is without jurisdiction to direct

of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822, which was passed
after our decision in United States ex rel. Bernardin v.
Butterworth, supra. It was there held that a suit to compel the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent abated
by the death of the Commissioner and could not be revived so as to bring in his successor even upon consent of
the latter. At the conclusion of its opinion the court said
(p. 605): "In view of the inconvenience, of which the
present case is a striking instance, occasioned by this state
of the law, it would seem desirable that Congress should
provide for the difficulty by enacting that, in the case of
suits against the heads of departments abating by death
or resignation, it should be lawful for the successor in office
to be brought into the case by petition, or some other
appropriate method."
Subdivision (b) applies only to proceedings brought by
or against those holding office under state authority. As
to such, it authorizes "similar proceedings" to those
specified in subdivision (a). It was passed after our
decision in Irwin v. Wright, supra. The opinion shows
(p. 222) that a suit to enjoin a public officer from enforcing a statute is personal and, in the absence of statutory
provision for continuing it against his successor, abates
upon his death or retirement from office. The court held
that the Act of February 8, 1899, did not authorize, the
substitution of a county treasurer for his predecessor in a
suit against the latter to enjoin collection of taxes. We
suggested that it would promote justice if -Congress were
to enlarge the scope of that Act so as to authorize substitution in suits by or against state officers and said:
"Under the present state of the law, an important litigation may be begun and carried through to this court after
much effort and expense, only to end in dismissal because,
in the necessary time consumed in reaching here, state
officials, parties to' the action, have retired from office.
It is a defect which only legislation can cure."

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court,

289 U.S.

Subdivision (c) extends to all cases covered by (a) and
(b). It merely requires that before substitution a nonconsenting officer shall be given notice and opportunity
to object. It does not prescribe the showing of facts necessary to warrant an order that the proceeding be continued by or against the successor. When construing the
section, it is to be borne in mind that Congress has authority to direct the conduct of federal officers in proceedings brought by or against them as such hnd may ordain
that they may sue or be sued as representatives of tl&
United States and stand in judgment on its behalf (I.C.C.
v. Oregon-WashingtonR. & N. Co., 288 U.S. 14, 27); but
that Congress is not. so empowered as to state officers.
The section is merely permissive; it does not require but
merely authorizes the court to order substitution in the
cases covered. It extends only to suits "relating to the
present or future discharge of . . . official duties." At
least as to state officers it does not purport to authorize theo
imposition of liability or restraint upon the successor on
account of anything done or threatened by the predecessor
individually.
As shown above, the purpose of the suits was to prevent
a wrong about to be committed by defendant acting outside, and in abuse of the powers of, his office. The wrongs
threatened or committed by him constitute no ground for
injunction against petitioner. Plaintiffs did not allege
that petitioner threatened or intended to do anything for
the enforcement of the statute. The mere declaration of
the statute that suits for recovery of penalties shall be
brought by the attorney general is not sufficient. Petitioner might hold, as plaintiffs maintain, that the statute
is unconstitutional and that, having regard to his official
oath, he rightly may refrain from effort to enforce it.

supra, is pertinent. ie said (p. 4): "The inherent difficulty in all these cases is not in the liability and suability
of the successor in a new suit. It is in the shifting from
the personal liability of the first officer for threatened
wrong or abWise of his office to the personal liability of his
successor when there is no pivity between them, as there
is not if the officer sued is injuring or is threatening to injure the comp~ainant, without lawful official authority.
There is no legal relation between the wrong committed
or about to be committed by the one,. and that by the
other."
It follows from what has been said that ยง 780 has no application to the case as presented and that the district
court had no jurisdiction to subistitute petitioner as a
party defendant, in place of his predecessor or to direct
that the suits be continued and maintained against him.
We have no occasion to decide whether or in what circumstances a successor in office who adopts the attitude of his
predecessor and is proceeding or threatening to proceed
to enforce the statute may be substituted in a pending
suit. That question is not here and is reserved.
Petitioner's application for leave to file is granted, the
case will be docketed and respondents' return filed, and
a writ of mandamus will issue commanding the respondents to vacate the decrees against petitioner and to dismiss
the suits as to him.
It is so ordered.
