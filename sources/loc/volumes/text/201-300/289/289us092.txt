C. A. BRADLEY, DOING BUSINESS AS WOLVERINE MOTOR FREIGHT LINES, v. PUBLIC
UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT. OF OHIO

No. 395.

Argued January 20, 23, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933

1. A state commission, after full hearing, denied a certificate of
public convenience and necessity to operate by motor, as a common carrier of property, over a particular state highway to the
state line with final destination beyond in an adjacent State, upon
the ground that the route specified was already so badly congested
by motor traffic that the addition of the applicant's proposed
service would cause excessive hazard to the safety of travelers and
property upon that highway. The applicant, though at liberty to
do so, did not apply for another route; nor did he prove that none
other was feasible. Held, that the order was not void as an exclusion from interstate commerce. P. 94.
2. A state order denying a common carrier by motor a certificate to
engage in interstate commerce, when made to promote public safety
and because of highway congestion, is an exercise of the police
power, and its effect on interstate comnmerce is merely incidental.
P. 95.
3. In dealing with the problem of safety of the highways, as in other
problems of motor transportation, the State may adopt measures

Opinion of the Court.

which favor vehicles used solely in the business of their owners, as
distinguished from those which are operated for hire by carriers
who use the highways as their place of business. P. 97.
4. Permitting operation by carriers already certificated, but denying
additional certificates to others, to avoid dangerous traffic congestion, is consistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 97.
5. The question whether a state statutory provision makes an unconstitutional discrimination need not be decided when the party
complaining does not appear to have been affected by it. P. 97.
125 Ohio St. 381; 181 N.E. 668, affirmed.
APPEAL from a judgment sustaining an order of the
Public Utilities Commission which denied a certificate of
public convenience and necessity to appellant to operate
as a common carrier by motor over a state highway.

Mr. LaRue Brown, with whom Mr. John T. Scott was
on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Thomas J. Herbert, with whom Mr. John W.
Bricker, Attorney General of Ohio, was on the brief, for
appellee.
MR. JUsTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Bradley applied to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio for a certificate of public convenience and necessity
to operate by"motor as a fcommon carrier of property
over State Route No. 20, extending from Cleveland,
Ohio, to the Ohio-Michigan line, with Flint, Michigan,
as final destination. The New York Central Railroad
and the Pennsylvania Railroad, opposing, moved that the
application be dismissed on the ground of the present
congested condition of that highway. Upon a full hearing, the Commission found " that said State Route No. 20,
at this time, is so badly congested by established motor
vehicle operations, that the addition of the applicant's

proposed service would create and maintain an excessive
and undue hazard to the safety and security of the travelling public, and the property upon such highway." It
therefore ordered: "That in the interest. of preserving
the public welfare, the application be, and hereby is,
denied."
In a petition for a rehearing, which was also denied,
Bradley urged, among other things, that denial of the
application for the certificate on the ground stated violated rights guaranteed to the applicant by the commerce
clause of the Federal Constitution and the equality clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The same claims were
asserted in a petition in error to the Supreme Court of
the State; were there denied (125 Ohio State 381; 181
N.E. 668) upon the authority of Motor Transport Co. v.
Public Utilities Co., 125 Ohio State 374; 181 N.E. 665;
and are renewed here upon this appeal. We are of
opinion that the claims are unfounded.
First. It is contended that the order of the Commission
is void because it excludes Bradley from interstate commerce. The order does not in terms exclude' him from
operating interstate. The denial of the certificate excludes him merely from Route 20. In specifying the
route, Bradley complied with the statutory requirement
that an applicant for a certificate shall set forth "the
complete route" over which he desires to operate. Ohio
General Code, § 614-90 (c). But the statute confers
upon an applicant the right to amend his application
before or after hearing or action by the Commission.
§ 614-91. And it authorizes him, after the certificate is
refused, to "file a new application or supplement any
former application, for the purpose of changing" the

was made or new application filed. For aught that
appears, some alternate or amended route, was available
on which there was no congestion. If no other feasible

92

Opinion of the Court.

route existed and that fact was deemed relevant, the duty
to prove it rested upon the applicant. It was not incumbent upon the Commission to offer a certificate over an
alternate route.
Second. It is contended that an order denying to a
common carrier by motor a certificate to engage in interstate transportation. necessarily violates the Commerce
Clause. The argument is that under the rule declared in Buck v. Kuykendall, 267 U.S. 307 and Bush
& Sons Co. v. Maloy, 267 U.S. 317, an interstate carrier
is entitled to a certificate as of right; and that hence the
reason for the commission's, refusal and its purpose are
immaterial. In those cases, safety was doubtless promoted when the certificate was denied, because intensification of traffic was thereby prevented. See Stephenson
v. Binford, 287 U.S. 251, 269-272. But there, promotion
of safety was merely an incident of the denial. Its purpose was to prevent competition deemed undesirable.
The test employed was the adequacy of existing transportation facilities; and since the transportation in question was interstate, denial of the certificate invaded the
province of Congress. In the case at bar, the purpose
of the denial was to promote safety; and the test employed was congestion of the highway. The effect of the
denial upon interstate commerce was merely an incident.
Protection against accidents, as against crime, presents
ordinarily a local problem. Regulation to ensure safety
is an exercise of the police power. It is primarily a state
function, whether the locus be private property or the
public highways. Congress has not dealt with the subject. Hence, even where the motor cars are used exclusively in interstate commerce, a State may freely exact
registration of the vehicle and an operator's license, Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U.S. 610, 622; Clark v. Poor, 274
U. S. 554, 557; Sprout v. South Bend, 277 U.S. 163, 169;
may require the appointment of an agent upon whom

process can be served in an action arising out of operation
of the vehicle within the State, Kane v. New Jersey, 242
U.S. 160; Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356; and may
require carriers to file contracts providing adequate insurance for the payment of judgments recovered for certain
injuries resulting' from their operations. Continental
Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U.S. 352, 365-366. Compare Packard v. Banton, 264 U.S. 140; Sprout v. South
Bend, 277 U.S. 163, 171-172; Hodge Co. v. Cincinnati,
284 U.S. 335, 337. The State may exclude from the
public highways vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, if of a size deemed dangerous to the public safety, Morris v. Duby, 274 U.S. 135, 144; Sproles v.
Binford, 286 U.S. 374, 389-390. Safety may require that
no additional vehicle be admitted to the highway. The
Commerce Clause is not violated by denial of the certificate to the appellant, if upon adequate evidence denial is
deemed necessary to promote the public safety. Compare
Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, 275 U.S. 164, 170-171.1
Third. It is contended that the order is void under the
Commerce Clause because the finding of congestion of
Route 20 is unsupported by evidence. The argument
is that the only evidence introduced on that issue consisted of two traffic counts, both in the single city of Fremont; that this evidence was insufficient because Route
20 extends for only 2.2 miles through Fremont, whereas
the total length of the portion which would be traversed
is about 100 miles; and that the evidence was conflicting.
The evidence was adequate to support the finding.

900, 902; Phillipsv. Moulton, 54 F. (2d) 119; Newport Electric Corp.
v. Oakley, 47 R.I. 19; 129 Ati. 613; Farnum v. Public Utilities
Comm'n, 52 R.I. 128; 158 At. 713. Compare contra, Red Ball

Opinion of the Court.

Moreover, no such objection is set forth in the statement
as to jurisdiction filed pursuant to Rule 12.
Fourth. It is contended that the statute as applied to
the plaintiff violates the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. There is no suggestion that
the plaintiff was treated-less favorably than others who
applied at the same time or thereafter for certificates as
common carriers; nor is there any suggestion that the
classification operates to favor intrastate over interstate
carriers. One argument is that the statute discriminates
unlawfully against common carriers in favor of shippers
who operate their own trucks. In dealing with the problem of safety of the highways, as in other problems of
motor transportation, the State may adopt measures
which favor vehicles used solely in the business of their
owners, as distinguished from those which are operated
for hire by carriers who use the highways as their place
of business. See Packard v. Banton, 264 U.S. 140, 144.
Compare Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, 280 U.S. 80, 82;
Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U.S. 352, 373;
Sproles v. Binford, 286 U.S. 374, 396. Another objection
is that to deny certificates to subsequent applicants discriminates unlawfully in favor of carriers previously certificated. But classification based on priority of authorized operation has a natural and obvious relation to the
purpose of the regulation. Conceivably, restriction of the
volume of traffic might be secured by limiting the extent
of each certificate-holder's use. But that would involve
re-apportionment whenever a new applicant appeared.
The guaranty of equal protection does not prevent the
State from adopting the simple expedient of prohibiting
operations by additional carriers.
There is a further argument that the statute discriminates unlawfully between common and contract carriers.
It rests upon the assumption that the statute is, as a
15450°-33--7

matter of construction, inapplicable to contract carriers.

On the question of construction, there appears to be no
authoritative decision.' We have no occasion to consider
that question. For it does not appear that there has been
discrimination against the plaintiff in favor of contract
carriers. Compare Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 U.S. 305,
314.

v. OKLAHOMA CITY ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA

No. 547.

Argued March 15, 1933.-Decided April 10, 1933

1. Jurisdiction of this Court of an appeal from the final judgment of
a state supreme court sufficiently appears, where the opinion of
that court on a first appeal of the case, from an interlocutoy
judgment, shows that the requisite federal question was raised by
and decided against the appellant, and where the second and final

decision of that court was made upon the authority of the first one.
P. 100.
2. A city ordinance conditioned the right to drill for oil or gas within
the city limits upon the filing of a bond, in the sum of $200,000 for
each well, to secure payment of damages from injuries to any persons or property " resulting from the drilling, operation or mainte-

nance of any well " or structures appurtenant thereto. Held consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
P. 101.

3. A further requirement that the bond be executed by some bonding
or indemnity company authorized to do business in the State, is
also valid. P. 101.
4. The wisdom and fairness of this requirement were for the city
council to decide, and its conclusion, not being clearly arbitrary or
unreasonable, binds the court. P. 102.
