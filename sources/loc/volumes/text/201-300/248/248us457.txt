COON v. KENNEDY.
453.

Opinion of the Court.

appropriate and adequate remedy by review here is obvious. Exercising a wise discretion we think the court
below properly denied an injunction. Upon the record
it was not called upon to inquire narrowly into the disputable points urged against the statute. No more are
we.

The judgment of the court below is

Affirmed.

COON v. KENNEDY.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF NEW JERSEY.
No. 398.

Argued December 11, 1918.-Decided January 13, 1919.

Under Jud. Code, ยง 237, as amended September 6, 1916, a writ of-error
does not lie to a judgment of a state court holding the state Workmen's Compensation Law inapplicable to a case of personal injuries
governed by the maritime law and holding the Act of October 6,
1917, which changes the rule in that regard, inapplicable retrospectively.
Writ of error to review 91 N. J. L. 598, dismissed.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. James D. Carpenter, Jr., for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Isidor Kalisch for defendant in error.
Memorandum opinion by MR. JusTcE MCREYNOLDS.
This writ of error runs to a judgment of the Court of
Errors and Appeals of New Jersey filed March 11, 1918,
91 N. J. L. 598, denying relief to Rebecca Coon who

248 U. S.

sued to recover under the New Jersey Workmen's Compensation Act on account of her husband's death by drowning in the navigable waters of that State whilc employed
as a fireman on a tug boat.
The court held that as the accident occurred August 4,
1915, the Act of Congress approved October 6, 1917, c. 97,
40 Stat. 395, "saving
to claimants the rights
and remedies under the workmen's compensation law
of any State" was inapplicable, and that under the doctrine announced in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244
U. S. 205, the rights of the parties depended upon the
maritime law of the United States.
There was no decision against the validity of a treaty
or statute of or an authority exercised under the United
States, nor in favor of the validity of a statute of or an
authority exercised under a State challenged because
of repugnance to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the
United States. Consequently, under the Act of September
6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, the writ of error was improperly sued out and must be
Dismissed.

J. HOMER FRITCH, INCORPORATED, ET AL. v.
UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 64.

Argued November 19, 1918.-Decided January 20, 1919.

Judgments of the District Courts in suits against the United States
under the Tucker Act are reviewable directly and exclusively by this
court; the Judiciary Act of 1891, and the Judicial Code, did not disturb the exclusive jurisdiction as it previously existed. Ogden v.
United States, 148 U. S. 390, declared overruled. P. 459.
