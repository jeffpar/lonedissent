v.

PUTNAM

INVESTMENT

COMPANY.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
No. 10.

Submitted November 7, 1918.-Decided November 18, 1918.

The contention that a contract of agency to sell real estate was void
because federal lands, under homestead entry, were included, presents no federal question where the state court found they were not
included and the record supports the finding.
Writ of error to review 96 Kansas, 109, dismissed:

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Lee Monroe for' plaintiff in error. Mr. James A. McClure and Mr. C. M. Monroe were also on the brief.
Mr. B. I. Litowwch for defendant in error.
niemorandum for the court by THE CHIEF JUSTICE.
Having previously considered this case (82 Kansas,
216; 87 Kansas, 842) the court awarded relief because of
the violation of a contract of employment to procure the
sale of real estate. 96 Kansas, 109.
The case is here in reliance upon a federal question
based upon the assumption that the authority to sell included land belonging to the United States covered by an
inchoate homestead entry. But the court below expressly

found that such land was not, included in the contract,
hence the sole basis for the asserted federal oue,;on disappears.
And this result is not changed by considering, to the
extent that it is our duty to do so. the question of fact
upon which the existence of the alleged federal question
depends. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 236
IU.S. 585, 593; Creswill v. Knights oj Pythias. *,2 U. S.
246, 261; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., 223 U. S. 573, 591. We so conclude bectuse
the result of discharging that duty leaves us convinced
that the finding below was adequately sustained; indeed,
that the record makes it clear that tlie alleged ground for
the federal question was a mere afterthought. The case,
therefore, must be and is
Dismissedfor want of jurisdiction.
