UNIONE AUSTRIACA DI NAVIGAZIONE &c.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 25.

Argued April 17, 1918.-Decided November 4, 1918.

Upon review of an admiralty case, the court has jurisdiction to make
such disposition of it as justice may require at the time of decision,
and therein must consider changes in fact and in law which have
supervened since the decree below was entered. P. 21.
In a libel in personam, brought by a British against an AustroHungarian corporation, while their countries were at war and the
United States was a neutral, to recover for coal furnished before the
war by the libelant to the respondent in Algiers, jurisdiction was obtained by attachment of a ship (for which a bond was substituted);
but, after answer and submission of the cause upon agreed facts and
proof of foreign law, the District Court declined to proceed, because
of prohibitions placed by. the belligerent countries on payment of
debts to each other's subjects, and dismissed the libel without prejudice. This country having entered the war after the case came to this
courtHeld: (1) That the libelant as a co-belligerent had a right to maintain the suit against the respondent, an 'alien enemy, and that jurisdiction should not be declined as an act of discretion. P. 21.
(2) That respondent, though an alien enemy, was entitled to defend,
and that, in view of the non-intercourse laws and the actual impossibility of free intercourse between residents of this country and of
Austria-Hungary, further prosecution should be suspended until
through restoration of peace, or otherwise, adequate presentation
of respondent's defense should become possible. P. 22.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

The Emily Souder, 17 Wall. 666. The obligation sued on
is in essence for goods sold and delivered--an obligation
justiciable in any civilized country, Cuba R. T? Co. v.
Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 478, and one peculiarly within the
jurisdiction of every maritime tribunal which could obtain
jurisdiction over the defendant by. attaclment or otherwise. If the debt had been assigned to a subject of any
power not at war with England, no question could have
been raised against enforcement here. The Anna Catharina, 4 C. Rob. 107, 112-113.
The respondent, conceding the obligation to pay, appeared generally and expressly admitted the jurisdiction
of the court. The objection raised, on the trial, viz, that
as a subject of Austria, and because of an alleged Austrian
moratorium, it Should not be compelled to pay to a British
subject, should have been pleaded. It was personal to the
respondent, not going to the subject-matter of the suit,
and the court, sua sponte, could not have made it. Under
well-settled principles, any objection to the court's taking
jurisdiction over respondent's person was waived. But
the courts below have erroneously allowed the respondent
to come in and go out at will. Cf. PortoRico v. Ramos, 232
U. S. 627, 632. They should have adjudicated the case in
regular course.
Our admiralty courts take jurisdiction, in proceedings
between foreigners either in rem or in personam, notwithstanding the contract in suit was made and to be
performed, or the tort complained of was committe, n a
foreign country or on the high seas. The only requisite is
jurisdiction of person or property. The Maggie Hammond,

Rep. 686; The Attualita, 238 Fed. Rep. 909. Although
in some suits between foreigners our admiralty courts
may have discretion to decline jursidiction, this is not such
a case. The discretion referred to is not absolute but
has been strictly defined by this court. The Maggie
Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 456, 457; The Belgenland, 114
U. S. 355.
This suit is plainly outside the exceptions enumerated
in The Belgenland, supra, and within the rule laid down in
that opinion, at pp. 368, 369. The controversy is communis juris, the parties do not belong to the same foreign
nation, and, further, most of the coal was bought and used
in carrying on trade between Trieste and New York,
which gave the United States an interest in the transaction as directly supporting its commerce. See The Belgenland, p. 366; and The Jerusalem, 2 Gall. 191.
The District Court's decision in effect gives extraterritorial force to the Austrian war law to bar the claim of a
British subject who had secured jurisdiction according to
our practice. Strict neutrality required that we disregard
the war measures of all belligerents and apply our laws,
since neither party had any claiin to have his own applied.
If, as declared by our Government, commerce in munitions
of war with the enemies of Germany was not unneutral
(cf. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Trading Co., 195
U. S. 439), how can it be said that the enforcement of
admitted simple contract obligations, having nothing to
do with war, infringes neutrality?
The failure of the courts to adjudicate this case isnot
comity, but a breach of comity. The defense is in reality
a plea of alien enemy, which so long ago as 1799 was said
by Lord Kenyon in Casseres v. Bell, 8 Term Reports, 166,
to be "an odious plea." Raised in the courts of a neutral
nation, such a plea was absurd and should have been as
a it is odious.

no alien enemies, this court is called upon by this defense
to discriminate in favor of the Austrian Government
against Englishmen. Since the obligation itself is not
affected by the prohibition, it seems clear enough that
the prohibition at most goes only to the party who shall
sue. An alien enemy has no right to sue in the courts of a
king with whom his own sovereign is at war, because a
personal disability of suing under such cireustances attaches to an alien. Daimler Co. v. Continental Tyre &
Rubber Co., [1916] 2 A. C. 307, 316. There is not any
such disability in an alien friend.
It is elementary, however, that the matter of parties
is to be governed by the law of the forum, and a question
of personal jurisdiction of a defendant may be waived.
A civil moratorium will be recognized in a foreign court
as the law at the place of payment, provided it is not inconsistent with the public policy of the forum, and is
otherwise enforceable. Rouquette v. Overman, L. R., 10
Q. B. 525. But there was no local moratorium prohibiting
payment in England, where payment in this case should
have been made, nor in Algiers where it might have been
made.
No rule of law which has hitherto been recognized can
be invoked to call for the enforcement in this country of
the Austrian prohibition as a moratorium. It was not
intended to relieve Austrian subjects from the immediate
pressure of debts, as is the case of ordinary moratorium
decrees, nor intended to benefit them at all. P , ivas
promulgated for the avowed purpose of injuring British
merchants' commerce and property in connection with
war, and is highlypenal.
It is immaterial that Great Britain enacted similar but
less stringent prohibitions. Robinson & Co. v. Continental
Ins. Co. of Mannheim, [1915] 1 K. B. 155. The courts
of one country will not enforce or recognize the penal
laws of another.

WATTS, WATTS & CO. v. UNIONE AUSTRIACA &c. 13

Argument for Petitioner.

The Austrian proclamation has no extraterritorial
operation. Comity in its true sense is limited to enforcing substantive rights, Wharton, Confl. of Laws, 3d ed.,
ยง 428A, vol. 2, pp. 938-939; Rorer, Interstate Law, p. 7;
accruing under some foreign law which is analogous to
the law existing in the State where the litigation arises,
Effect cannot be given to the defense unless this Austrian
war measure is enforced as a part of our municipal law.
To do this would be the very denial of comity. The reasons stated by the District Judge have been strongly
disapproved in Compagnie Universelle de Telegraphie v.
United States Service Corporation, 84 N. J. Eq. 604; s. c.,
85 id. 601.
Confiscation of the debt in Austria, even if such proceedings had been taken, could not have any extraterritorial effect. Baglin- v. Cusenier Co., 221 U. S. 580;
Hall, International Law, 4th ed., p. 459.
If, as the respondent argues the effect of the giving of
the drafts was to transfer the place of payment from Algiers to London, which the libelant denies, it does not
avail as a defense. Under the law of England, as set forth
in the King's Proclamation, known as "Trading with the
Enemy Proclamation No. 2," issued on September 9, 1914,
express permission was given to one in the position of the
libelant to receive payment from an enemy, without being
guilty of a prohibited transaction. Oronstein'& Koppel

Further, under British law, if jurisdiction could have been
obtained over the defendant, the libelant could have maintained an action for the amount due for the coal in the
English courts. Robinson & Co. v. ContinentalIns. Co. of

Mr. Charles S. Haight, with whom Mr. Clarence Bishop
Smith was on the brief, for respondent:
If the court must take jurisdiction, against its better
judgment, merely because it has the power to do so, there
is no discretion.. The claim that respondent admitted
jurisdiction is erroneous. The courts in each case between
foreigners, in connection with contracts made and to be
performed abroad, should decide whether it is proper and
will promote justice to take jurisdiction. This principle
is clearly stated in The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435,
and The Belgenland, 114 U. S. 355, which make it clear
that "the question is one of discretion in every case."
In the case at bar a controversy communis juris has been
modified by the war statutes of belligerent nations. The
exercise of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal,
unless that discretion has been abused. Earnshaw v.
United States, 146 U. S. 60; Sun Cheong-Kee v. United
States, 3 Wall. 32%; Silsby v. Foote, 14 How. 218; The

nection with a contract which is made and to be performed
outside of the United States, the District Court, in its
discretion, ordinarily does not take jurisdiction if one
party objects. Goldman v. Furness, Withy & Co., 101
Fed. Rep. 467.
Not only are all of the reasons of convenience opposed
to the trial of such cases hiere, but an Amerik;n court is
not the appropriate forum to pronounce upon
questions
of foreign law, especially where the parties are all foreigners. Foreign law is difficult to prove, and in cases of
doubt the court should be slow to assume that the law of
these countries is the same as that of the United States.
*Cuba R. R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473.
The, complications of the war have strengthened and
emphasized the reasons for refusing to take Jurisdiction.
War prevents intercourse between belligerents and suspends the payment of debts, so that belligeient nations
in modern times do not consider it necessary to confiscate
debts. In recent times it has been customary to confiscate only property at sea; but there can be no question
about the right of a belligerent to confiscate every kind
of enemy property within its reach, on land and on sea,
'including the debts owed by its subjects. J Kent, Com.,
64, 65; Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 122, 124:
Porter v. Freudenberg, [1915] 1 K. B. 857, 869; The Rapid,
1 Gall. 205. Baglin v. Cu.enier Co., 221 U. S. 580; Hall,
International Law, p. 458, distinguished.
It is clear, therefore, that the rights and liabiliir - of
the parties in the case at bar have been vitally altered by
the declaration of war. Their contracts and rights of
property are suspended, and, in addition, the Austrian
Government has the clear right to confiscate the credits
of the libelant, by ordering the respondent to pay to the
Austrian Governm;nt itself. Such a confiscation woUld
destroy the right of the libelant to recover from the
respondent.

-Argument for Respondent.

If the courts do not recognize this suspension of obligations, confiscation of debts by belligerents will be stimulated, which is undesirable. Austrian law having forbidden any payments to English citizens, during the war,
under penalty of imprisonment and fine, and England
having similarly forbidden her citizens to make payments
to Austrians, it can hardly be supposed that this court
would undertake to order a foreign corporation, in such a
case as this, to commit a crime against the laws of its own
country.
To have taken jurisdiction woul-d have amounted to an
abuse of discretion. The only case cited for the proposition that the United States should entertain a suit between
citizens of belligerent nations, during war, is Compagnie
Universelle de Telegraphic v. United States Sertice Corporation, 84 N. J. Eq. 604, a case distinguishable, among other
reasons, as involving a contract for the sale of land in the
United States, to be performed here.
This court does not give extraterritorial force to a German or Austrian law when it recognizes the fact that the
defendant is absolutely prohibited, by the law of his own
country, from paying the debt sued upon, and is subject
to heavy penalties if he does so. The power of a government to prohibit its own citizens from doing any treasonable act beyond its own boundaries is well illustrated by
the cases where the courts of one State have restrained
citizens of that State from bringing suit in another State
or in a foreign country. Cole v. Cunninghann, 133 U. S.
107; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S.

248 U. S,

241 'U. S. 544, both hold that an appeal to the Circuit
Court of Appeals is , ch a trial, but neither so holds of a
review of that court's decision on certiorari. The trend
of legislation is to have cases disposed of in the Circuit
Court of Appeals as far as possible. But, were jurisdiction discretionary, it should be declined, because of the
foreign character of the parties and the contract, and the
inaccessibility of witniesses,-reasons accentuated by the
war, and to avoid which the parties made A stipulation
whose construction is now in dispute.
That one is not obliged to perform a contract made
.before the war, when its performance has become illegal,
see The Teutonia, L. R., 3 A. & E. 394; s. c. L. R., 4 P. C.
171, 181, 187; The Rapid, 1 Gall. 295.. The important
point to note is that the relations which exist between individual enemies during war are treated by a general rule,
and individual instances are not considered to determine
whether some person in this country, or the country as a
whole, will be benefited thereby.
All debts are suspended during war, and no interest then
accrues because the obligation is wholly suspended. See
Hiatt v. Brown, 15 Wall. 177, (which is not distinguishable as involving an executory contract, since the money
was due during the war); DuBellqix v. Lord Waterpark,
24 Rev. Rep. 628, 630, s. c. 1 Dowl. & Ry. 16-20; Rederei
Actien Gesellschaft Oceana v. Clutha Shipping Cq,, 226
Fed..Rep. 339, 342.
The fact that an express permission was given in T.ngland to enable creditors to sue under the policy laid down
in Great Britain for this war, is evidence of the general
rule that during war4 contracts are suspended. See Robinson & Co. v. Continental Ins. Co. of Mannheim, [1915]
1 K. 3.155.
The McVeigh Case, 11 Wall. 259, and the authcrities
cited in it do not in any way affect the, question whether
contractual obligations axe suspended dr'ring war.

MR. JusncE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
On August 4, 1914, Great Britain declared war against
Germany, and on August 12, 1914, against AustriaHungary. Prior to August 4, Watts, Watts & Co.,
Limited, a British corporation, had supplied to Unione
Austriaca di Navigazione, an Austro-Hungarian corporation, bunker coal at Algiers, a dependency of the French
Republic. Drafts on London given therefor having been
-protested for non-payment, the seller brought, on August 24, 1914, a libel in personam against the purchaser
in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern
District of New York. Jurisdiction Was obtained by
attaching one of the steamers to which the coal had been
furnished. The attachment was discharged by giving a
bond which is now in force. The respondent appeared
and filed an answer which admitted that the case was
within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court; and it was
submitted for decision upon a stipulation as to facts and
proof of foreign law.
The respondent contended that the District Court, as
a court of a neutral nation, should not exercise its juris-

transfer, by process of judgment and execution, k/
by one alien belligerent to another; an act wnicih -t aileged was prohibited alike by the municipal iaw oi ooth
belligerents. The libelant replied that performance of
the contract by respondent, that is, the paymcia of a
debt due, was legal by the law of the place of periormance,
whether that place be taken to be Algier , L3ndon;
that it was immaterial whether it was legal by uhe ,ustroHungarian law, since Austria-Hungary was not tnu piace
of performance; and that the enforcement of legal rights
here would not infringe the attitude of impartiality which
underlies neutrality. The District Court held lthaL it
had jurisdiction of the controversy, and that it was within
its discretion to determine whether it should exercse di0
jurisdiction, since both parties were aliens and the cause
of action arose and was to be performed abroad. It tl el
dismissed the libel without prejudice, saying: 'From
the standpoint of this neutral jurisdiction the coiiroimug
consideration is that the law of both belligerent countries
[Great Britain and Austria-Hungary] forbids a payment
by one belligerent subject to his enemy during the continuance of war. This court, in the exercise of jurisdiction founded on comity, may not ignore that state of war
and disregard the consequences resulting from it." 224
Fed. Rep. 188, 194.
The dismissal by the District Court was entered on
May 27, 1915. On December 14, 1915, the decree wa6

that it was within the discretion of the trial court to

discretion should not be interfered with, since no abuse
was showr. 229 Fed. Rep. 136. On June i2, 19W6, an

exercise of discretion by the District Court was denied
(241 U. S. 655), and a writ of certiorari was granted by
this court. 241 U. S. 677. The certiorari and return
were filed July 21, 1916. On December 7, 1917, the
President issued a proclamation declaring that a state
of war exists between the United States and AustriaHungary. The case was argued here on April 17, 1918.
This court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction,

entered below, but to make such disposition of the case
as justice may at this time require. Butler v. Eaton, 141
U. S.240; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Dennis,
224 U. S. 503, 506. And in determining what justice
now require3 the court must consider the changes in fact
and in law which have supervened since the decree was
entered below. United States v. Hamburg-Amerikanische
Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, 239 U. S. 466, 475, 478;

Cranch, 103, 109-110. In the case at bar the rule is the

Irvine v. The Hesper, 122 U. S.256, 266; Reid v. American
Express Co., 241 U. S.544.
Since the certiorari was granted, the relation of the
parties to the court has changed radically. Then, as
earlier, the proceeding was one between alien belligerents
in a court of a neutral nation. Now, it is a suit by one
belligerent in a court of a co-belligerent against a common
enemy. A suit may be brought in our courts against an
alien enemy.' McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall. 259, 267.

1917, ยง 3 -(c), c. 106, 40 Stat. 411. And we take notice of
the fact that free intercourse between residents of the
two countries has been also physically impossible. It
is true that, more than three years ago, a stipulatio as
to the facts and the proof of foreign law was entered ints
by the then counsel for respondent, who has died si'lce.
But reasons may conceivably exist why that stipulation
ought to be discharged or. modified, or why it should be
supplemented by evidence. We cannot say that, for the
proper conduct of the defense, consultation between
client and counsel and intercourse between their iespective countries may not be essential even at this stfge.
The war precludes this.
Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the
decree dismissing the libel should be set aside and the
case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, but that no action should be taken there (except
such, if any, as may be required to preserve the security
and the rights of ther parties in statu quo) until, by reason
of the restoration of peace between the United States
and Austria-Hngary, or otherwise, it may become

The contention that a contract of agency to sell real estate was void
because federal lands, under homestead entry, were included, presents no federal question where the state court found they were not
included and the record supports the finding.
Writ of error to review 96 Kansas, 109, dismissed:

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Lee Monroe for' plaintiff in error. Mr. James A. McClure and Mr. C. M. Monroe were also on the brief.
Mr. B. I. Litowwch for defendant in error.
niemorandum for the court by THE CHIEF JUSTICE.
Having previously considered this case (82 Kansas,
216; 87 Kansas, 842) the court awarded relief because of
the violation of a contract of employment to procure the
sale of real estate. 96 Kansas, 109.
The case is here in reliance upon a federal question
based upon the assumption that the authority to sell included land belonging to the United States covered by an
