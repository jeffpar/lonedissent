An ordinance provision respecting the service to be rendered by a street
car company (in this case respecting the transfer privileges to be
accorded passengers,) will not be adjudged to have created a contract obligation beyond legislative control if the power of the municipality under the state law, and its intention, to create such an
obligation do not clearly appear.
Writ of error to review 62 Colorado, 229, dismissed.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. L. F. Twitchell for plaintiff in error. Mr. S. D.
Crump and Mr. H. C. Allen were also on the brief:
The Act of 1913, known as the Public Utilities Act,
if given the construction placed upon it by the majority
of the state court, is a violation of the constitutional inhibition against impairing the obligation of contracts.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Fred Farrarfor defendant in error:

A federal question cannot be raised for the first time in
a petition for a rehearing in the state court unless in the
consideration of that petition that court rules upon the
federal question in denying the application. McCorquodale v. Texas, 211 U. S. 432.
The case is controlled by a long line of decisions, both
state and federal, which recognize the distinction between
cases inwhich the municipality has been granted the power
to enter into irrevocable contracts with utility companies,
and those in which the municipality either had no direct
authority to enter into such a contract, or, having the
power to contract, the contract was subject to revocation whenever the latent power of the State was called
into action and the supervision of rates and fares undertaken. Milwaukee &c. Co. v. R. R. Commission of Wisconsin, 238 U. S. 174; Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles,

MR. JUSTICE

HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is a bill to compel the defendant to arrange for
passengers on its road to be transported without extra
fare over the line of the Denver City Tramway Company from a point of connection and in like manner for

passengers on that company's line to be carried over the
defendant's line without additional charge. The defendant operates a street railway under a franchise granted
by the plaintiff while a town. By § 6 of the ordinance
making the grant the grantees were allowed to charge
certain fares provided that they should make the arrangement stated above. The defence pleaded against being
required to comply with these terms is that the Denver
City Tramway Company charges five cents, the maximum
fare allowed, for its part of the service, so that the defendant gets nothing, and that the defendant filed a
schedule of rates with the State Public Utilities Commission which now are the defendant's established rates and
charges. On demurrer the Supreme Court of the State
held that this town, at least, deriving its powers from legislative grant, could make no contract of this sort that was
not subject to control by the legislature, that the Public
Utilities Commission had been authorized by the legislature to regulate the matter in controversy, that it had
done so, and that this proceeding should be dismissed.
Of course we do not go behind the decision of the Court
that the matter in controversy was subject to regulation
by the Commission and was regulated by it in due form
if the State could confer that power. The plaintiff says
that the State could not confer it since to do so would
impair the obligation of a contract. Upon that point we
agree with the Court below that clearer language than
'can be found in the state laws and this ordinance must be
used before a public service is withdrawn from public
control. Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co. v. Railroad
Commission of Wisconsin, 238 U. S. 174, 180. The cases
generally are, cases where the railroad or other company
sets up contract rights against the city. Whether when
the railroad consents a legislature would not have all the
power that the city could have to modify even a constitutionally protected contract need not be considered

Syllabus.

here. If we deal with the present case on the merits there
seems to be no sufficient reason why the writ of error
should not be dismissed. It is giving the plaintiff the
benefit of a very great doubt if we assume that the question on the merits was saved.
Writ of error dismissed.

THE HEBE COMPANY ET AL. v. SHAW, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE OF OHIO, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 664.

Argued December 11, 12, 1918.-Decided January 7, 1919.

The General Code of Ohio, § 12725, forbids, under criminal penalty,
the manufacture, sale, etc., of condensed milk, unless made from
unadulterated milk from which the cream has not been removed and
in which the milk solids are equivalent to 12% of those in crude milk
and 25% of them fat, and unless the container is distinctly labeled,
stamped or marked with its true name, brand and by whom and
under what name made; by § 5778 a food is adulterated if a valuable
ingredient has been wholly or in part abstracted; and § 12720 allows skimmed milk to be sold only under restrictions. Appellants'
product, assumed to be wholesome and nutritious, and consisting
of condensed skimmed milk combined with cocoanut oil, was imported from another State in cases each containing a number of the
one pound or six ounce cans in which it was retailed, each can being
labeled "Hebe A Compound of Evaporated Skimmed Milk and
Vegetable Fat Contains 6% Vegetable Fat, 24% Total Solids,"
with the place of manufacture and address of the company, and the
words "For Coffee and Cereals For Baking and Cooking."
Held: (1) That the product was within the prohibition of § 12725.
P. 302.
(2) That, as so construed and applied, the statute did not violate the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 303.
(3) That, as applied to the cans containing the product, the prohibition
