must then be distributed as a part thereof to those who will
then have the right to take the estate as provided for in the
will. The accumulation is to be treated as a surplus arising
from both real and personal estate, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the main fund are to take the surplus as
if it arose entirely from personalty. Some of the cases upon
this subject are gathered in the brief of counsel for the-trustee
and it is not necessary to cite them here. Holding the trust
to be valid, it is not now necessary to determine to whom the
distribution is to be made when the time for distribution shall
arrive.
The trust company is entitled to take the property and
execute the trust. We do not understand that this is now controverted by -counsel for any of the parties. In any event, it
does not affect the validity of the trust. If the trustee named
could not act the court would appoint a trustee to carry out
the provisions of the trust. Vidal v. Girard,2 How. 127, 191;

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 8.. Argued March 11, 12, 1908.-Decided December 7, 1908.

In this case the Circuit Court had jurisdiction under the provision
of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, 472, to enforce a lien for
professional services, on property within the district, although some
of the defendants did not reside therein.
An objection to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court based on the resi'dence of defendant, although diverse citizenship exists, may be
waived, and is waived if not seasonably made. In re Moore, 209
U. S. 490.

Statement of the Case.

211 U. S.

A decree in a suit in the Circuit Court between citizens of different
States is not violative of § 720, Rev. Stat., because it determines
liens on distributive shares in an estate under administration in a
state probate court and enjoins transmission of that share to the
original administrator until satisfaction of the lien.
Quwre, whether it is within the power of a state court to order property
on which there is an asserted lien to be sent out of the district, thereby
defeating the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to enforce the lien
under the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, 472.
The fact that proceedings for the administration of an estate are pending in the probate court does not deprive the Circuit Court of the
United States of jurisdiction to determine whether a lien exists in
favor of citizens of another State on some of the distributive shares,
the lien only to be enforced after the probate -court shall have finished
its functions.
Section 629, Rev. Stat., does not deprive the Circuit Court of jurisdiction of an action brought by a citizen of another State against an
administrator to enforce a lien on the distributive share of an heir
of defendant's intestate because that heir being of the -same State
as the defendant could not sue him. in the Circuit Court.
An ancillary administrator in one jurisdiction is not in privity with
an ancillary administrator in another jurisdiction, and a judgment
against the one is not res judicata and a bar to a suit by the other.

Ingersoll, deceased, sued the respondents and certain other
persons. in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Dis-

Statement of the Case.

trict of Massachusetts, to subject certain interests in the estate
of Andrew J. Davis to a lien which is alleged to have accrued
to her intestate by the agreement which is set out in the opinion,
and by the laws of Montana, in which State the services were
rendered.
Andrew J. Davis, a man of great wealth, a citizen of Montana, died, leaving property in that State and in Massachusetts. By a will, which was offered for probate in Montana,
all of his property was left to his brother, John A. Davis.
Certain other of his next of kin, five in number (referred to in
the bill as the "five heirs"), associated to contest the probate
of the will. Henry A. Root, one of the respondents, and a
nephew of Andrew J. Davis, agreed with the four other contestants to conduct the litigation and to procure evidence and
counsel at his own expense, receiving therefor an assignment
of a part of the prospective distributive shares of the others.
Joseph A. Coram, another respondent, also acquired an interest in the prospective shares of some of the contestants.
Robert G. Ingersoll, the petitioner's intestate, was engaged
as counsel to conduct the litigation, and Root and Coram entered into the agreement with him, which will hereafter be
set out.
Upon the trial of the contest the jury disagreed. Pending
the preparation for the second trial an agreement of compromise was made, by which Ingersoll's clients received a larger
portion of the estate than though Davis had died intestate.
It is alleged that this was the result of. Ingersoll's services as
counsel. "By reason," it is alleged, "and in consideration of
the prosecution of said contests, and the force, effect, and
stress thereof, as against the proponent of such alleged will,
in preventing the admission thereof to probate, and in consideration of the determination of said controversy and litigation, and for no other consideration or reason," was the
compromise effected. It is hence further alleged that the
"will was defeated in so far as it could affect the rights, shares,
or interest in and to said estate of said five heirs mentioned in

to toonly
entitled
ette of said estate as such heirs at law of
Andrew J. Davis, deceased, and got absolute right and title
to 5151 eleven-hundreths thereof, through the prosecution of
said contests and decree determining the same." Two hundred and fifty eleven-hundredths, it is alleged, were allotted
directly to said five heirs and 2651 eleven-hundredths, for their
use and benefit, to Charles H. Palmer (a respondent here)
and Andrew J. Davis, Jr., trustees. A copy of the decree was
annexed to the bill and made part of it. And it is alleged
that by reason of said agreement and the fulfillment thereof
and the "provisions of the laws and statutes of Montana,"
.which are set out, an attorney's lien accrued in favor of said
Ingersoll and his legal representatives, "and is existing and
is in force and effect upon the portions, parcels, and interests
of, in and to the funds and other property of said Andrew J.
Davis, deceased, so acquired for said five heirs." That Root
and Coram have conveyed away the real estate vested in them
by the decree determining the said will contests, and that the
distributions under said decree "have practically exhausted
the funds and property of said estate in the State of Montana,
and that by reason of the employment of Ingersoll and the
services rendered by him and by the promises of payment an
equitable lien exists on the funds and effects acquired by said
heirs, situate in Boston, Mass.," and that such funds and effects
should not be distributed or carried away "in default of payment of said indebtedness owing by Root and Coram to the
estate and legal representative of Robert G. Ingersoll, deceased, but that said funds and effects situate in Boston, Mass.,
should be and remain subject to said indebtedness, and to be
resorted to for the payment thereof."
It is alleged that John H. Leyson is the duly appointed,
qualified and acting administrator of the estate of Andrew J.
Davis, deceased, situate in Massachusetts, and has custody of
the funds and effects acquired by Root and his associates, and

upon which the said lien exists in favor of the estate and legal
representatives of Ingersoll, and that if such funds and effects
should be distributed the lien will be defeated.
The death of Ingersoll in the State of New York is alleged,
and the appointment of Eva A. Ingersoll, administratrix, by
the Surrogate's Court of the county of Westchester, of that
State, and her qualification. And it is alleged that she was
subsequently appointed administratrix of his estate by the
Probate Court of the county of Suffolk, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, situate in that Commonwealth, and that she
duly qualified as such. It is alleged that the estate of Andrew J.
Davis, situate in Boston, and in the hands of said John 1t.
Leyson as administrator, consists of money, convertible stocks
and bonds of the value of $450,000, after paying expenses of
administration, of which funds and effects Coram and other
parties for whom Ingersoll prosecuted said will contest are
entitled by virtue of the decree of the District Court of the
State of Montana, directly and through Charles H. Palmer
and Andrew J. Davis, Jr., to 515j eleven-hundredths, "acquired as part of the fruits of the labors of said Robert G.
Ingersoll in the prosecution of said will contests." That Root,
Coram and their associates have petitioned the Probate Court
of Suffolk County to order distribution of said shares of said
funds and effects to them. That all of said 515 eleven-hundredths, except the interest owned by Sarah Maria Cummings
and the interest owned by Ellen S. Cornue, are subject to the
lien of Ingersoll. It is alleged that the interests of Elizabeth S.
Ladd and Mary L. Dunbar have been transferred to Root and
Coram.
A conspiracy and purlpose of Coram and Root to defeat the
lien of Ingersoll are alleged, and that distribution of the estate
in Massachisetts is sought as a means thereto; further, that
if the funds and effects be removed from Massachusetts or
distributed to Root and Coram before the representatives of
said Ingersoll have an opportunity to enforce their lien, the
same will be placld beyond their reach and the payment of

the indebtedness secured thereby defeated; that the funds and
effects remaining in Montana will be required and used to pay
indebtedness and expenses of administration there; and that
Root and Coram have no tangible property other than their
shares and interest in the estate of Davis.
It is further alleged that petitioner brought suit in the District Court of the State pf Montana in her name, as administratrix of Robert G. Ingersoll, to enforce payment of said
claim existing in favor of the estate and legal representatives
of Ingersoll. That Root and the other defendants therein
appeared and demurred to the complaint on the ground that
the same did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, but did not specify or raise the objection that she was
not qualified to prosecute said suit, although she alleged her
appointment as administratrix by the Surrogate's Court of
New York. That upon her urging the pendency of said suit
against the petition for distribution filed by Root and Coram
and their associates, it was objected that said suit had not
been brought by an administrator of Ingersoll appointed in
Montana. The court sustained the objection. That thereupon
John S. Harris was appointed administrator in Montana, and
substituted in said suit for respondent. The cause coming on
to be heard in the District Court of Montana, Root objected
to the introduction of any evidence, on the ground that the
complaint therein did not-state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action. The motion was sustained, and without
further proceedings the court granted a nonsuit and dismissed
the complaint on the alleged ground that it did not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in consequence no
trial therdof has been had, nor has the claim and lien of Ingersoll ever been adjudicated, nor is it barred by any statute of
limitation.
The hill prays an injunction against Leyson to restrain him
from deliv'ering, and against respondents to restrain them from
receiving, said tunds and. effects and for the appointment of
receiver, discovery of Coram's interest, and judgment for

the same, and that it be declared a lien on such interest. Judgment is prayed against Root for $95,000, with interest, and
that the sum be declared a lien on 'his shares and interests.
What else is prayed need not be noticed.
There were demurrers to the bill that went to the parties,
the jurisdiction of the court, to the merits, and that the judgment of the District Court of Montana constituted a bar.
The grounds of demurrer to jurisdiction were expressed in the
demurrer filed by Root and Coram and Herbert P. Cummings,
executor of the last will and testament of Sarah Maria Cummings, one of the five heirs, as follows:
"2. These defendants also demur to the bill of complaint
upon the further ground that this court has not jurisdiction
of this action, because it appears from the said bill that this
action is brought to secure from this court a writ of injunction
staying proceedings now pending in the Probate Court, in and
for the county of Suffolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
to distribute the funds and effects of the estate of Andrew J.
Davis, deceased, situate in the State of Massachusetts, among
the persons entitled thereto, or to otherwise dispose of said
funds and effects, and this court is forbidden by section 720
of the United States Revised Statutes from granting a writ
of injunction to stay proceedings in any court of a State."
The demurrer of Leyson was more general, stating that the
court "had no jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for in the
bill of complaint or any part thereof." And Andrew J. Davis
particularized this by the specification that to enjoin the disposition of property in the hands of Leyson as administrator
"would be an interference with the proceedings of the Probate
Court of Suffolk County having jurisdiction of the matter, and
would be unauthorized and illegal."
The demurrers were overruled except as against certain
parties, and except so far as the bill claimed a statutory lien.
The court said: "No statutory lien can be maintained, and
that portion of the bill must be regarded as ineffectual; and
as it is specially demurred to, it mnust be stricken out." 127

To the questions propounded by the court I counsel answer:
1. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to ascertain and declare
a lien upon property in the possession of the administrator
appointed by the Probate Court for the County of Suffolk
and State of Massachusetts.
The case at bar has in view the establishment of a lien on
certain shares of funds and effects, which, although now in
the hands of an administrator of an estate already settled,
with the exception of possibly a few minor details, as shown
without dispute, will be distributed to the parties holden for
the debt secured by that lien.
'See post, p. 354.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Argument for Petitioner.

211 U. S.

The administrator is a necessary party for the purpose of
the suit and to protect the lien on the shares in his hands subject thereto, which he will have for distribution to the parties
holden for the debt secured by the lien. The lien can only be
established and protected by a court of equity jurisdiction.

No Probate Court, as such, could adjudicate the question
of debt and the existence of the lien involved in the case at bar.
Perrisv. Higley, 20 Wall. 375.
No abridgment of the equity jurisdiction of state courts
by state law would restrict or impair the chancery jurisdiction
of the Federal court sitting in that State. Payne v. Hook, 7

A controversy as to the existence of a debt and lien on
property to secure it, or other equitable right in property in
the hands of an administrator or executor, may be adjudicated
and determined by a court of equity without seizing or taking
actual possession of the property on which the lien rests.

Court of Massachusetts, must be exercised independently of
their ordinary probate jurisdiction. Sherman v. Am. Cong.
Assn., 113 Fed. Rep. 609, and cases cited. The jurisdiction
in equity given to the Probate Court of Massachusetts by
Stat. 1891, c. 415, § 1, is a jurisdiction concurrent with that
.of other equity courts. Bennett v. Kimball, 175 Massachusetts,
199. The Probate Court's possession is for certain prescribed
administrative purposes. It has no possession that excludes
established chancery jurisdiction over equitable rights touching the property. The chancery jurisdiction is not different
in Massachusetts. And if it were different there, by virtue of
state law, the equity jurisdiction of the Federal court would
not be thereby impaired.

The appellant (petitioner) has not established the existence
of any lien on any interest of any of the defendants in the
estate of Andrew J. Davis in Massachusetts.
No lien can be maintained unless an equitable lien was
created by act of the parties. No statutory lien can be maintained. It is not now open to appellant to assert the existence
of a statutory lien. Landram v. Jordan,203 -U.S. 56, and
cases there cited. The Montana statute could not create a
lien upon property in Massachusetts. The Montana statute
does not create a lien in a will contest. Montana Code of Civil

There is no equitable lien created by contract. In the present
case there was not even a promise to pay from a particular
fund. An equitable lien is not created by a promise to pay
from a specified fund unaccompanied by some sort of assignment. This rule has long been the settled law of this court.

The judgment in the suit brought in Montana is a bar to
the maintenance of this suit. Harris as ancillary administrator in Montana had power to bring the suit. The suit was
brought by Harris as ancillary administrator, with full knowledge, consent and authority of the principal administratrix.
The suit was maintainable by an ancillary administrator without any assignment from the domiciliary administratrix.
The doctrine that personal property has a situs only at the
domicil of the owner is a rule of convenience that never applied
to the question of situs for purposes of administration, and that
for all purposes is limited in its scope. Upon the death of the
creditor the situs of the debt for purposes of dealing with it as
property is recognized as the domicil of the debtor precisely

with the Montana law that the judgment against Harris was

brought by him is conclusive as to that cause of action against
the domiciliary or any other ancillary administrator.
Appellant did not establish the existence of any debt due
from the defendants or any of them. The will was not "defeated" either in form or in substance. The defendants did
not "get their shares" within the meaning of the contract before the suit was brought. The conditions not having been
fulfilled, the appellant cannot recover.
To the questions propounded by the court, counsel answer:
1. The court has rio jurisdiction to ascertain and declare
a lien upon property in the possession of the administrator
appointed by the Probate Court for the County of Suffolk
and State of Massachusetts; it cannot entertain such a suit
unless there is a res of which it can take jurisdiction. Robertson v. Carson, 19 Wall. 94; Goodman v. Niblack, 102 U. S.
556; Ins. Co. v. Bangs, 103 U. S. 435; Mellen v. Moline

Compton v. Jesup, 167 U. S. 1; Roller v. Holly, 176 U. S. 398;
McDaniel v. Traylor, 196 U. S. 415.
There was no res within the jurisdiction upon which the
decree of the court could be enforced. Byers v. McAuley, 149
U. S. 608; Hess v. Reynolds, 113 U. S. 73, and other cases.
Even in a suit inter partes founded on personal jurisdiction
the Circuit Court would not have jurisdiction to ascertain
and declare a lien upon the property in possession of the
ancillary administrator appointed in Massachusetts. Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189; Mager v. Grime, 8 How. 490,
493; Security Trust Co. v. Black River Nat. Bank, 187 U. S.

U. S. 43, 56; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608.
2. The Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to foreclose a
lien, if one existed, on property in the Probate Court for administration.
3. The Circuit Court had not jurisdiction to determine the
shares of Root and Corain in the property in the possession of

the Probate Court. Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425; Hook v.
Payne, 14 Wall. 252; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608.
4. Neither on the present bill nor any amendment can
an order be entered requiring Leyson, Root or Coram to retain property hereafter coming into their hands to satisfy
the complainant's claim. Cates v. Allen, 149 U. S. 451; Hollins
v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371.
5. The Circuit Court is excluded from any exercise of jurisdiction which disturbs the possession of the property by the
Probate Court or the free exercise by the Probate Court of its
jurisdiction over the property, and this limitation -excludes
jurisdiction of the case at bar.
Controversies in which a title is asserted adverse to the
title of the deceased do not involve any question as to this
limitation of jurisdiction. Erwin v. Lowry, 7 How. 172;
Williams v. Benedict, 8 How. 107; Wiswall v. Sampson, 14
How. 52; Peale v. Phipps, 14 How. 368, 376.
The limitation prevents any exercise of jurisdiction by other
courts inconsistent with the possession of property by the
Probate Court or with its exercise of exclusive jurisdiction
in matters of probate administration. Suydam v. Broadnax,
14 Pet. 67; Williams v. Benedict, 8 How. 107; Union Bank v.
Jolly, 18 How. 503; Green's Admx. v. Creighton, 23 How.

Race, 92 U. S. 116; Borer v. Chapman, 119 U. S. 587; Ellis v.
Davis, 109 U. S. 485.
Whether the remedy in a given case is by a proceeding
inter partes or by a probate proceeding depends upon the
law of the State. Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485; Farrell v.
O'Brien, 199 U. S. 89; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425.
Under the law of Massachusetts there can be no proceeding inter partes to recover a distributive share until the Probate Court has ordered distribution. Haskins v. Hawkes,

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA,

after stating the case as above, de-

livered the opinion of the court.
A question of jurisdiction occurs. It was discussed somewhat,
in the original briefs, of counsel, but questions were submitted

to them as appropriate to elicit further discussion.1 We find
it, however, more convenient and more conducive to brevity,
in passing on the question of jurisdiction, to be somewhat

upon property in the possession of the administrator appointed by
the Probate Court for the county of Suffolk and State of Massachu-

setts?
2. Has the Circuit Court jurisdiction to enforce by foreclosure a lien
upon property so situated?
3. Has the Circuit Court jurisdiction to determine the slhares of Root
and Coram in the property so situated?
4. Has the Circuit Court jurisdiction, upon the pending bill either
in its present form or as it might be amended, to direct that Leyson,
Root, Coram,.or either of them, should hold any property, coming into
their hands by order of distribution of the Probate Court, upon the
trust to satisfy the claim of the complainant?
5. To what extent, if any, is the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
limited or affected by the fact that the property from which payment
is sought is in the hands of an administrator appointed by the Probate
Court of Suffolk County?
6. Has the Probate Court of Suffolk County, as ancillary to its possession of the property, jurisdiction in equity to ascertain, declare, enforce,
and foreclose a lien upon it?

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.
211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

general. The petitioner (and her intestate) were citizens of
New York. The defendants in the suit below, nine in number,
were citizens of Massachusetts. Coram was a citizen of Massachusetts. Root and Andrew J. Davis, trustee, were citizens
of Montana. Leyson was also a citizen of Montana. It is
hence contended that, while there was diversity of citizenship
when the suit was brought, there was no jurisdiction against
Root and Andrew J. Davis, they not being inhabitants of the
district. The suit against them, it is further contended, was
without jurisdiction also, because it was not brought either
in the district of the residence of the plaintiff or the defendant. And this, it was said, was recognized by the bill, which
prayed an order for the absent defendants to appear and plead
in accordance with § 738, Rev. Stat., now act of March 3, 1875,
18 Stat. 470, 472. That act provides, § 8, for notice to absent
defendants in any suit "to enforce any legal or equitable lien
or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within
the district." And it is urged that the Circuit Judge said that
the proceeding could only be sustained under that act.
The objection that Massachusetts was not the district of the
residenc of either Root or Davis was not made to the bill.
The objection to the jurisdiction made by the demurrers was
to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to interfere with or stay
proceedings in a Probate Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It makes no difference how the parties were served
or brought in. Being in, all objections to the bill should have
been made. The bill prayed a personal judgment against
Root as well as a lien upon his share, and those represented
by Coram, in the hands of Leyson as administrator of Davis,
deceased, and that Leyson be restrained from paying them
and R ot and Coram from receiving or carrying them away.
And general relief was also prayed. •In other words, the whole
case arising from Ingersoll's service and the remedies for that
,service was presented. And to this case the defendants were
summoned to answer. They did answer as to the jurisdiction
of the court as to subject-matter, as 'to the relation of the

courts of the United States to the courts of Massachusetts.
They did not answer as to the jurisdiction of the court as to
parties, as to the rights of the parties to be sued in the district
of their residence. The latter objection may be waived, and is
waived by not being made. In re Moore, 209 U. S. 490.
To decide what jurisdiction the Circuit Court exercised we
must consider the decree. It found all of the allegations of the
bill to be true, and that. there was due and owing to the
plaintiff (petitioner here), on the contract executed by Coram
and Root the sum of $95,000, with interest, amounting in
all to the sum of $138,810.83. It adjudged Root to be personally indebted and liable for that sum and awarded execution against him, and for any balance that should be due
if the property upon which the lien was declared, as presently
mentioned, should not satisfy such indebtedness; that Coram
was personally obligated and liable for the payment of said
indebtedness upon the full amount which he had received, or
should receive, from the shares of the estate of Andrew J.
Davis, deceased, acquired for the five heirs mentioned in said
agreement, or either of them, under or pursuant to the decree
of the District Court of the State of Montana. It was also
found and decreed that there was in the State of Massachusetts, in the hands of John H. Leyson, as administrator of
Andrew J. 'Davis, deceased, $337,862, and .137 bonds of the
United States, and 170 bonds of the Butte and Boston Consolidated Mining Company, of which money and bonds and
the increase thereof, the said five heirs of Andrew J. Davis,
deceased, and their legal representatives and successors in
interest, weie entitled to receive 515 cleven-hundredths under and pursuant to the decree of the District Court of the
State of Montana; and of which money and bonds and the
increase thereof Coram and Root were entitled to have and
receive 4151 eleven-hundredths parts on distribution of such
money and bonds by the proper court having jurisdiction
thereof in the administration and distribution of the estate
of Andrew J. Davis, deceased. Upon such 4151 eleven-hun-

Opinion of the Court.

dredths parts petitioner was decreed to have a lien "subject
to all proper and lawful administration," as a part of the
estate of Andrew J. Davis, deceased, "pursuant to the orders
and decrees or judgments of the Probate Court of Suffolk
County, Massachusetts, now having probate jurisdiction thereof,
or any court which may hereafter have probate jurisdiction . . . to administer the same as part of the estate
of said Andrew J. Davis, deceased, in the due and lawful
course of administration thereof." A lien is decreed upon
said money and bonds and foreclosed subject to the terms of
the decree wheresoever said money and bonds may be taken
or removed, whether within or without the State of Massachusetts, and in the custody of whomsoever the same may come,
"subject only to the proper and lawful probate administrar
tion . . . pursuant to the orders, judgments or decrees
of the Probate Court of Suffolk County, in the State of Massachusetts, now having probate jurisdiction thereof . . . to
administer the same as a part of the estate of Andrew J. Davis,
deceased, in the due and lawful course of administration
thereof." And it was decreed that as soon as the probate administration is finished and distribution is ordered by the
Probate Court having jurisdiction, that Leyson, as administrator, or his successor in custody thereof, should set apart
and bring into court the said 4151 eleven-hundredths of said
money and bonds, to be applied to the satisfaction of the lien
of complainant. It was decreed that each and all of the injunctive and restraining terms and commands of the interlocutory injunction order be made perpetual, and Leyson was
enjoined and restrained, as administrator, from removing out
of Massachusetts 415J eleven-hundredths parts of the money
and bonds in his possession, "unless and until the proper court
within the State of Massachusetts, having probate jurisdiction
of said money and bonds, by its final order, judgment or decree, directs said John H. Leyson, as such administrator, to
remove said 4151 eleven-hundredths of said money and bonds
out of the State of lassachusetts."

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

We have made this epitome of the :main provisions of the
decree to show how careful the court was to require the observance of its direction expressed in its opinion that the decree should declare that nothing in it was intended to contravene, or should contravene, "any action of any probate tribunal
in Massachusetts with reference to distribution, or to any
order or judgment remitting to the courts of the domicil."
The decree therefore deals exclusively with the parties. It
adjudges what contract they made, the extent of their obligation and how that conttact was secured. The remedies awarded
are executed through the parties, and through Leyson only
as he holds property to be delivered to the parties. No action
of the Probate Court of Suffolk County is attempted to be
restrained or limited or trenched upon, nor the property in its
possession disturbed. And yet it is urged that the suit that
sought this purpose and a decree that executes this purpose
transcend the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court of the United
States.
The proposition has been discussed at length by counsel,
many cases cited and arguments *advanced based upon the
respective functions of courts of equity and probate.
The respondents especially rely upon the pendency of proceedings in the Probate Court of Suffolk County, and as a
corollary that the property was in the possession of the Probate Court and under its jurisdiction, and, therefore, not
within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Respondents
express and illustrate the latter conclusion in various ways.
Their fundamental postulate, however, is that. the Circuit
Court has nbt power to disturb the possession of the property
by the Probate Court or do any act which may interfere with
the free exercise of jurisdiction by the Probate Court. This
postulate is argued at length and many cases are cited. Besides, a statute of Massachusetts is relied upon which provides
that upon the settlement of an estate, and after the payment
of all debts for which the same is liable in that Commonwealth,
the residue of the personal estate may be distributed and dis-

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.

Opinion of the Court.

posed of in the manner provided by the Will of a deceased, if
he left any, or according to the laws of the State or country
of which he was an inhabitant, "or, in the discretion of the
court, 'it may be transmitted to the executor or administrator, if
any, in the State or country wbhere the deceased had his domicil,
to be there disposed of according to the laws thereof." (Italics
ours.)
We think, however, a lengthy discussion is not necesry.
The controversy presented by the bill was one between citizens of different States, and there was that ground of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, being a court of the United States.
One object of the bill, among others, was to declare and foreclose a lien upon property within the district, and there was
that ground of jurisdiction, and we do not think that jurisdiction thus established and supported was taken away. by the
mere fact that the settlement of the estate of Davis was pendingin the Probate Court of Suffolk County. No interference
with that court was sought or decreed, as-we have seen. Rights
between the parties arising from their transactions and contracts were only adjudged and only decreed to be redressed
when the Probate Court should have finished- its functions.
Indeed it may even be that the Circuit Court was too restrictive in the exercise of its power, for it may be disputed whether
it is within the power of a state court to order property upon
which there is a lien, sent out of a district and thereby defeat
the jurisdiction of a court of the United States to enforce such
lien in cases where they have jurisdiction under the act of
March 3, 1875. This question, however, does not arise, nor
any question depending upon it, and the line of cases of which
Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, 208 U. S. 38, is an example does not apply, nor do the cases cited by respondent,
but the *case falls within the principles announced in Pyne v.
Hook, 7 Wall. 425, and Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S.608, and.
cases there cited.

Ricketson v. Merrill, 148 Massachusetts, 76. The same in principle is Davis et al. v. Newton, 6 Met. 537, where it was held
that the distributive share of an insolvent debtor in the hands
of an administrator passed to his .assignee, and that the administrator could not withhold it from the assignee.
In Lenz v. Prescott, 144 Massachusetts, 505, it was decided
that the Probate Court does not take cognizance of assignments of their interests, made by legatees or distributees, but
deals only with those primarily entitled to the legacies or distributive shares; and many cases were cited. The court therefore sustained a bill in equity to ascertain the validity and
construction of an assignment of an interest in an estate. See
also Green v. Gaskill, 175 Massachusetts, 265, where the probate jurisdiction of the Probate Court and its equity jurisdiction in relation to other courts is explained, and it is decided
that administrators and executors have a right to have their
accounts adjusted and the amounts due to or from them determined in the Probate Court, on its-probate side, and in the
usual probate proceedings, but when the amount for which
they are liable is so determined, may, by a bill in equity, be
compelled to pay to those entitled their share of the property
of the deceased. And this being the power of the courts of
-equity of the State, a like power certainly may be exercised by
the Federal courts.
It is further objected that there is no property of the respondents in Massachusetts. The argument which is urged to support the objection is difficult to state. It seems to draw a
distinction, under the laws of Massachusetts, between the will
of Andrew J. Davis and the decree of the Montana court admitting the will to probate. "The Probate Court," respondents say, "might and did accept the decree of the Montana
court as proof that the will ought to be allowed. It could not
and did not accept the decree as establishing that the property in Massachusetts should be disposed of ctherwise than as
the will provided." And from a consideration of the laws

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.
211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of Massachusetts, respondents conclude that (we quote the
language of counsel), "No part of the property Jn Massachusetts can therefore in any sense be said to belong to the defendants in the suit. All of it must by law either be paid over
according to the will, or be transmitted to Montana, to be
distributed as the court may diree." We cannot refrain from
saying that it is hard to believe that respondents would like
to be taken at the full sense of their words, and we are quite
sure that the Probate Court of Suffolk County will regard not
the will as propounded for probate, but the will as qualified
-by the decree, as determining the rights of the parties. At
any rate, it is only upon the shares which that court will distribute that the decree of the Circuit Court will operate.
Again, it is charged that the right of the petitioner's intestate
was derived from Root, and as he, it is further contended,
could not have sued to establish his right to a share in the
funds of the administrator, the latter and he being citizens
of Montana, that the petitioner was equally disqualified to
establish and recover Root's share of the property. The
argument is that she is seeking to enforce a right of Root
against the administrator arising on an equitable assignment
by Root to her intestate, and she i§ therefore, it is said, suing
to recover as assignee of a chose in action upon which the
assignor could not sue, because his citizenship is the same.as
that of the administrator-in Massachusetts. Sec. 629, Rev.
Stat. There are several answers to the contention. It is
certainly very disputable if an interest in a distributive share
of an estate is within the statute. Again, she is suing primarily on the obligation of Root to her intestate to secure
which a lien was given on Root's distributive share; and besides, again, she sues as administratrix, and she is a citizen of
a different State from Leyson. Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cranch, 333;
Chappedelaine v. Dechenaux, 4 Cranch, 308; Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387; Coal Company v. Blatch/ord, 11 Wall. 172;
Rice v. Houston, 13 Wall. 66.
Respondents assert the identity of the action in Montana

OCTOBER TERM, 1908
Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

with the present suit, and upon that identity they urge that
such action constitutes res judicata. Petitioner denies the
identity of the actions, and urges besides that there is no such
privity between the parties as to make the Montana action
res Iudicata of the pending case. In support of the latter contention petitioner urges that an ancillary administrator in one
jurisdiction is not in privity with an ancillary administrator
in another jurisdiction, and that therefore a judgment against
one is not a bar to a suit by the other. And this was the ruling
of the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals took the
contrary view, and rested its judgment upon the conclusive
effect of the Montana action.
We shall assume that there is identity of subject-matter
between the Montana action and that at bar, but the question
remains, Was there identity of parties? An extended discussion of the question is made unnecessary by the case of
Brown v. Fletcher's Estate, 210 U. S. 82. In that case a suit
in equity against Fletcher, brought in his lifetime, was re-,ived after his death, and a decree obtained. Fletcher resided
in Michigan, where he died leaving a will, which was duly
probated in the Probate Court of Wayne County in that State,
in which the decree of the Massachusetts courts was filed as
evidence of a claim against the estate. Its effect as such was
denied, and 'the case was brought here by writ of 'error. 'Replying to the contention of plaintiff in error, that the Michigan
executor and the administrator with the. will annexed of
Fletcher's estate in Massachusetts were in such privity that
the decree was conclusive evidence of it in the proceedings in
Michigan, this court held that the decree was not binding upon
the Michigan executor or the estate in his possession, citing
,Vaughan v. Northrup, 15 Pet. 1; Aspden v. Nixon, 4 HOW.
467; Stacy, Admr., v. Thrasher, 6 How. 44. The latter case
was quoted from as follows: "'Where administrations are
granted to different persons in different States, they are so
.far deemed independent of each other that a judgment obtained against one will furnish no right of action against the

Opinion of the Court.

other, to affect assets received by the latter in virtue of his
own administration; for in contemplation of law, there is no
privity between him and the other administrator. See Story,
Confl. of Laws, § 522; Brodie v. Bickley, 2 Rawle, 431.' "
McLean v. Meek, 18 How. 16; Johnson v. Powers, 139 U. S.
156, were also cited, and it was said that the "doctrine was.
enforced in Massachusetts. Low v. Bartlett, 8 Allen, 259."
Respondents insist that this doctrine has no application to
the Montana judgment, and urge that the latter was a bar of
the pending suit (1) because it was a judgment on the merits,
and (2) because such a judgment "against an ancillary administrator in the suit brought by him is conclusive as to that
cause of action against the domiciliary or any other ancillary
administrator." And this is said to follow from the proposition
which appellant advances, that "the authorized act of an
ancillary administrator as to property of the intestate within
his jurisdiction is binding everywhere," and it is hence concluded that a suit brought by an ancillary administrator is
subject to the same principle as an act done touching tangible
property. That the argument by which this conclusion is
supported has strength is established by the fact that the
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded to it, and it is said to be
sanctioned by Biddle v. Wilkins, 1 Pet. 686; Wilkens v. Ellett,
108 U. S. 256; Talmage v. Chapel, 16 Massachusetts, 71. But
as these cases preceded Brown v. Fletcher's Estate, -they must
be regarded as consistent with it. Besides, in that case, Johnson v. Powers, 139 U. S.-156, was cited as establishing, on the
authority of Aspden v. Nixon, Stacy v. Thrasher, Low v. Bartlett,
8 Allen, 259, the doctrine that a judgment recovered against
the administrator of a deceased person in one State is no
evidence of debt, in a subsequent suit by the same plaintiff
in another State, either against an administrator, whether
the same or a different person, appointed there, or against
any other person having assets of the deceased. That there is
a certain amount of artificiality in the doctrine was pointed
out in Stacy v. Thrasher, and that it leads to the inconvenience

Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

and burdensome result of retrying controversies and repeating
litigations. The doctrine, however, was vindicated as a necessary consequence of the different sources from which the
different administrators received their powers, and the absence
of privity between them, and that the imputations against
it were not greater than could be made against other "logical
conclusions upon admitted legal principles." It is not necessary, therefore, to review in detail the argument of respondents. Its fundamental concept is that the authorized act of
an administrator as to property of the intestate within his
jurisdiction is binding everywhere, and it is said that a suit
brought by an administrator is subject to the same principle.
The generality of the conclusion, however, counsel immediately limit by the concession that it does not include a suit
brought against an administrator, whether he successfully or
unsuccessfully defends it. In other words, the principle is
true only of an action brought by an ancillary administrator
to enforce a claim in behalf of the estate and judgment goes
against him. But counsel even limit this again, and says it
would not be binding "in the sense of creating a personal.
liability for costs, if costs be awarded, or otherwise, but it is
binding in the sense that the cause
of action has been effect
S
ively disposed of." That is, as counsel explains, merged in"
the judgment. We do not think that the doctrine announced
in Brown v..Fletcher's Estate, supra, admits of these distinctions,
and surely the estoppel of a judgment must be mutual. The
argument of appellees contends for the contrary; it makes, a
judgment, against an ancillary administrator binding against
other administrators, but not binding for them. We think,
therefore, that the Montana judgment is not a bar to the pending suit.
On the merits there are two propositions: (1) Did the complainant establish the existence of a debt due -from Coram 4nd
Root to Ingersoll? (2) Did she establish the existence of a
lien? On nither of these propositions did the Court of Appeals
pass; the Circuit Court decided them in favor of complainant.

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.
211 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

We need not recite the evidence. The Circuit Court found,
and, we think, rightly found, that the agreement sued on was
performed. In other words, that the will of Davis was defeated, and that the contestants got their shares through the
services of Ingersoll. The form in which the defeat was expressed is unimportant. The will as propounded was defeated.
As propounded it cut them off from inheritance. As qualified
in probate, by compromise more property was received than
would have come to them by inheritance. And the evidence
leaves no doubt that it was brought about, to quote the bill,
"by the force, effect and stress" of the contest and by the
services, which it is admitted Ingersoll rendered, and from the
belief that the will as propounded would not receive probate
and would only receive probate when so qualified as to recognize the rights of the contestants as heirs of the estate. That
it did not do so was its defect and to make it do so was the
purpose for which they employed Ingersoll and which his
services achieved. There was performance, therefore, of his
contract.
The next question is, Doesithe evidence establish the existence of the lien? An affirmative answer must be given. It is
manifest that payment to Ingersoll was dependent upon success, but it is equally manifest that he relied upon more than
the personal responsibility of the parties. The so-called five
heirs, Elizabeth S. Ladd, Sarah M Cumming, M. Louise Dunbar,
Ellen Cornue, and Henry A. Root entered into an agreement
in which it was recited that controversies had arisen in regard
to the will, and that Root had rendered services and expended
money in behalf thereof, and had undertaken "to procure
evidence, counsel and such other needs " as were necessary for
opposing the will and obtaining for the others their "respective rights and shares" of the estate, and in consideration
thereof there was assigned to Root and one Gideon Wells onethird part of each of their interersts to reimburse Root for the
moneys h had expended or should expend or the liabilities
which he might incur on account thereof. And it was agreed

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

that the assignment was to be .in full for past or future liabilities. Root, on his part, agreea to employ counsel and to
do all things necessary to secure the interests of the other
parties.
It is alleged in the complaint and admitted-ny the answer
that Coram acquired the remaining interests of Elizabeth Ladd
and Mary L. Dunbar and that the interests so acquired were
dependent upon the prosecution of the objections to and contests of the validity of the will until the shares of the five
heirs should be secured to them by a grant from the proponent
of the will or by the decree of the District Court of Montana.
This being the situation, Ingersoll wrote to Root as follows:
"May 1st, 1891.
"My dear Root. Do not know whether I can get the
money, but feel sure I can raise $25,000-have already secured $13,000"Now, there is another thing: I suppose it is best for you and
I to have a specific and definite understanding in regard to
my fee. Of course, if you should lose the case you could not
pay. We can raise money enough to pay expenses and of course
I shall want expenses-but the real question is as to what I
am to have in case of success and how that is to be securedi. e. what papers are necessary, etc.
"Let me hear from you.
"Yours,
"R. G. INGERSOLL."
To which Coram and Root replied as follows:
"Butte City, Mont., August 17, 1891.
"R. G. Ingersoll, Esq., Butte City, Montana.
"Sir: We agree that for your services in the contest of Maria
Cummings and Henry A. Root against the probate of the alleged will of A. J. Davis, deceased, rendered and to be rendered,
that your fee, in case the will is defeated and our clients get
their shares, shall be one hundred (100,000) thousand dollars,
and that your expenses and disbursements shall be paid in
any event.

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.
211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"There is to be no personal obligation against J. A. Coram,
in the event that the interests represented by Henry A. Root
are unsuccessful, and in no event is the said J. A. Coram obligated except. to pay such fee out of the funds secured from
the estate of A. J. Davis, deceased, by Maria Cummings,
Lizzie S. Ladd, M. Louise Dunbar and Mrs. Ellen S. Cornue
and-Henry A. Root.
"HENRY

A.

RoOT,

"J. A. CORAM."
It is evident,. therefore, that Ingersoll asked for security in a
definite and written form. We do not think it can be said
that he sought only a promise to pay. That followed from his
employment, and besides Coram stipulated against personal
liability, but did obligate himself to pay "out of the funds
secured from the estate." And this is the test of the agreement.
It is the exception that establishes that as to Root there was
a personal and property obligation; as to Coram, a property
obligation. It is confirmed by excerpts from the letters of
Root set out in the complaint and introduced in evidence.
In those letters he expresses a desire "That Mrs. Ingersollshould realize out of the Davis estate as much as possible,"
and would "bend every effort" to that end. And, explaining
the agreement, he said that Ingersoll "was to receive $100,000
from moneys collected from the Davis estate for his services,"
and assured Mrs. Ingersoll that he would do everything in his
power to see that she received "as much from that fund,"
(referring to the estate in Boston).
The sufficiency of the agreement of August 17, 1891, to
create a lien seems not to have been seriously questioned in
the Circuit Court upon the argument of the demurrer. However the court said that "Upon all settled rules with reference
to the construction of such instruments we cannot doubt that
this one of August 17, 1891, created a lien on the funds therein
referred to in behalf of Mr. Ingersoll." On the final hearing
the effect of the instrument was contested, and the court adhered to its ruling, saying, "Whether or not the particular

211 U.,S.

agreement creates a lien is a matter of construction. In this
case the fact that there was no primary personal responsibility
on J. A. Coram specially serves to stamp the agreement in
issue as declaring a purpose to create a lien. Therefore, on
the whole, we hold that, on this final hearing on bill, answer
and proofs, the bill must be sustained." The conclusion of
the court is sustained by authority. In Wylie v. Coxe, 15
How. 415, a contract was made with an attorney for the prosecution of a claim against Mexico to pay him a contingent fee
of five per cent out of the fund awarded. It was held that the
agreement constituted a lien upon the fund. In In're Paschal,
10 Wall. 483, in the letter retaining Paschal it was said that his
compensation would depend upon the action of a future legislature, "unless a recovery is had in the suit, in which event
I shall feel authorized to let you retain it out of the amount
received." It was held that in accordance with the prevailing
rule in this country Paschal had a lien on the fund in his hands
for disbursement and professional fees. The case was cited in
McPherson v. Cox, 96 U. S. 404, 417, and the doctrine repeated.
See also Central Railroadv. Pettus, 113 U. S. 116; Louisville &c.
Railroad Company v. Wilson, 138 U. S. 501, 507. In Walker
v. Brown, 165 U. S. 654, it was held that every express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting party
sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular
property, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identified, a security for a debt or other obligations, creates an
equitable lien on the property so indicated. This was an application of the doctrine of Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, 165
U. S. 634, and Ketchum v. St. Louis, 101 U. S. 306. These
cases are not opposed by Trist v. Child, 21 Wall. 441, and
Wright v; Ellison, 1 Wall. 16. In the latter case it is said that
it is indispensable to the lien thus created that there should
be a distinct appropriation of the fund by the debtor, and an
agreement that the debtor should be. paid out of it. These
conditions are satisfied in the case at bar.
The other contentions of respondents assert a defect of par-

ties and error in the decree as to the amount of interest adjudged to Root and Coram in the property. In the first contention
we do rot concur.
The second
contention is justified. We do not think, however, that it is necessary to enter into all of its details, with
some of which, we may say, we do not agree. We: think that
the Circuit Court rightly, as we have already pointed out,
adjudged that the five heirs were entitled, by virtue of the
final decree in Montana, to 515 eleven-hundredths of the estate
in Massachusetts, and in adopting, as we think it did, in inaking division among. them according to intestacy, that is, in
proportion to the shares they would have taken in case Davis
had died intestate. Those shares the bill alleged and the
answers admitted would have been as follows: Sarah M. Cummings and Elizabeth S. Ladd, one-eleventh each; Ilenry A.
Root, Ellen S. Cornue and Mary Louise Dinbar, one twentysecond each-in all, 350 eleven-hundredths of the estate. But
there was error in adjudging that the interest reinaining in
Sarah Maria Cummings and Ellen S. Cornue, afler the assign1ment of one-third of their interest to Root, to be respectively
sixty-two and two-thirds eleven-hundredths and tiirty-thre
and one-third eleven-hundredths. The hill shows that dhey
were entitled respectively to one hundred eleven-hundredths
and fifty eleven-hundredths of the amount they as two of the
five heirs would have been entitled to if Davis had died intestate, that is, those shares of three hundred and fifty elevenhundredths. But the amount was increased by the decree in
Montana to 515 1 eleven-hundredths and their' shares thereof
necessarily increased. "In other words, as they were entitled
respectively to

respectively to 4 and -- of the second amount, to wit, 14 7-r
eleven -hundredths and 7 3-T'r 6leven-hundredths, one-third of
which amounts was assigned to Root. There were left in theni
respectively, therefore, 984- eleven-hundredths and 49k elevenhundredths. To Root, as we have seen, they assigned
