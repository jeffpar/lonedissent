Justice Moody speaking for a unanimous Court, "It is safe

to say that no case can be found where this court has
deliberately approved the issuance of an injunction
against the enforcement of an ordinance resting on state

authority, merely because it was illegal or unconstitutional, unless further circumstances were shown which

brought the case within some clear ground of equity jurisdiction."

INDIAN MOTOCYCLE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 5. Argued April 25, 1929. Reargued October 24, 27, 1930.-Decided May 25, 1931.
1. A certificate from the Court of Claims presenting a question of
law suitably distinct and definite, may be entertained although it
be apparent that, with the facts as settled by an agreed statement
accepted below, a decision of the question, either way, will be decisive of the case. P. 573.
2. The tax laid by § 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924 upon certain
specified articles, including motorcycles, "sold . . .by the manufacturer . . ." equivalent to 5% of the price for which they are
so sold, the statute requiring the manufacturers to make return of
their sales and to pay the tax, is an excise on the sale and not on
the manufacture or on the manufacture and sale. P. 573.
3. The principle that the instrumentalities, means and operations
whereby the States exert their governmental powers are exempt
from taxation by the United States, is not affected by the amount
of the particular tax or the extent of the resulting interference, but
is absolute. P. 575.

Argument for the United States.

4. Where a motorcycle is sold by its manufacturer to a municipal
corporation of a State for use by such corporation in its police
service, the transaction can not constitutionally be taxed by the
United States under § 600 of the Revenue Act of. 1924. Pp. 572,

Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 225, the taxes in question were
not laid on transactions involving an exercise of governmental functions, and their bearing on governmental operations was so indirect
or remote as to place them outside the principle which is applicable
here. P. 579.

RESPONSE to a question certified by the Court of Claims,
in a suit to recover money collected as a sales tax.
Mr. Monte Appel, with whom Mr. FrederickSchwertner
was on the brief, for Indian Motocycle Co.
Solicitor General Thacher, with whom Assistant Attorney General Rugg and Messrs. Fred K. Dyar and H.
Brian Holland were on the brief, for the United States.
The tax is distinguishable from the tax in the Panhandle Case. Both are excises; but in this case the tax is
imposed on the privilege of manufacturing and thereafter selling a motor cycle, whereas, in the Panhandle
Case, the tax was imposed on the privilege of sale alone.
Cf. Wheeler Lumber Co. v. United States, 281 U. S.
572, 579.
The tax was not imposed upon the State, or upon any
instrumentality of the State. It was imposed upon the
manufacturer with respect to all sales of his product.
The manufacturer added the amount of the tax to his
bill, but its payment by the City of Westfield was part
of the bargain between the parties, and the tax was not
in any sense imposed on the City. Lash's Products Co.
v. United States, 278 U. S. 175; Snyder v. Bettman, 190
U. S. 249. Indeed, it may fairly be assumed that the price
paid by the City would have been the same if the tax had

been imposed on the manufacture of the motor cycle
regardless of its sale.
Nor was the manufacturer an agent or employee of the
State or municipality. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269
U. S. 514.
Mr. John E. Hughes filed a brief for the Excelsior Motor
Mfg. & Supply Co. as amicus curiae.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This is a certificate from the Court of Claims. At a
prior term the certificate was dismissed as not in accord
with applicable rules and then reinstated, as in Wheeler
Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United States, 281 U. S.
572. It since has been amended, and further argument
has been heard.
The facts disclosed in the certificate are: In 1925 the
plaintiff, a corporate manufacturer of motorcycles in
Massachusetts, sold a motorcycle of its manufacture to the
City of Westfield, a municipal corporation of that Commonwealth, for use by the city in its police service. A
tax in respect of the sale was assessed and collected from
the plaintiff under § 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,
43 Stat. 322. After due but unsuccessful effort to have
the same refunded, the plaintiff brought suit in the Court
of Claims to recover the money so exacted from it-the
tax being assailed as invalid, as it had been in the application for a refund, on the ground that it was imposed in
contravention of the constitutional immunity of the State
and her governmental agencies from federal taxation.
The parties submitted an agreed statement showing the
facts here recited, and the Court of Claims then certified
to this Court the question (we state its substance), where
a motorcycle is sold by its manufacturer to a municipal

Opinion of the Court.

corporation of a State for use by such corporation in its
police service, can the transaction be taxed under § 600 of
the Revenue Act of 1924 consistently with the constitutional immunity of the State and her governmental agencies from federal taxation.
Our jurisdiction to entertain certificates from the Court
of Claims, and the limitations on that jurisdiction, are
explained in Wheeler Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v.
United States, supra. The present certificate when tested
by the rules there stated is unobjectionable. It presents
a question of law suitably distinct and definite. And
while, with the facts settled by an agreed statement accepted below, it is apparent that a decision of the question either way will be decisive of the case, this affords no
ground for declining to entertain the certificate. United
States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 66, and cases cited.
Section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat.
253, 332, is part of Title VI entitled Excise Taxes. The
section provides that there "shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid upon the following articles sold or leased
by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, a tax equivalent to the following percentage of the price for which so
sold or leased." Motorcycles are among the articles
enumerated and the applicable tax is five per centum of
the price for which they are sold. Manufacturers, producers and importers are required severally to make returns of their sales and to pay the tax.
This taxing provision is a reenactment, with minor
changes not material here, of a provision which was included in the Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, § 600, 40 Stat.
300, 316, and repeated in succeeding enactments. It is
now § 600 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9,
93; U. S. C., Title 26, § 881.
Both parties rightly regard the tax as an excise, and
not a direct tax on the articles named. But they differ as

to the transaction or act on which it is laid. Counsel for
the plaintiff insist it is laid on the sale. Counsel for the
Government regard it as laid on manufacture, production
or importation, or, in the alternative, on any one of these
and the sale. We think it is laid on the sale, and on that
alone. It is levied as of the time of sale and is measured
according to the price obtained by the sale. It is not
laid on all sales, but only on first or initial sales--those
'by the manufacturer, producer or importer. Subsequent
sales, as where purchasers at first sales resell, are not
taxed. Counsel for the Government base their contention on the requirement that the tax be paid by "the
manufacturer, producer or importer "; but we think this
requirement is intended to be no more than a comprehensive and convenient mode of reaching all first or initial
sales, and that it does not reflect a purpose to base the
tax in any way on manufacture, production or importation. Importation, as such, already was otherwise taxed,
c. 356, § 1, par. 369, 42 Stat. 858, 885, U. S. C., Title 19,
§ 121, par. 369, and in our opinion the words relied on
fall short of expressing a purpose to subject it to a further
tax.

This view of the tax is not new. The administrative
bureau adopted it at the outset and has adhered to it up
to the present time. The regulations issued under the
Revenue Act of 1917 said on this point: "The tax is on
the sale of the articles mentioned," 20 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev.
365; and this is repeated in the later regulations 21 Tr.
Dec. Int. Rev. 412; 23 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 68; 24 Tr. Dec.
Int. Rev. 56; 26 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 592. Indeed, the tax
is frequently spoken of in the regulations as a sales tax.
And it is so described in reports of congressional committees dealing with revenue bills in which it was retained. Sen. Rep. No. 398, p. 40, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.;
House Rep. No. 1, p. 16, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. While not
controlling, this administrative and legislative action

INDIAN MOTOCYCLE CO. v. U. S.
570

Opinion of the Court.

strengthens our conclusion, drawn from the taxing provision, that the tax is laid on the sale, and on that alone.
The cases of Cornell v. Coyne, 192 U. S. 418, and American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, 250 U. S. 459, cited by counsel
for the Government, are not pertinent; for both related
to taxes distinctly imposed on manufacturing.
With this understanding of the nature of the tax, we
come to the question propounded in the certificate.
It is an established principle of our constitutional system of dual government that the instrumentalities, means
and operations whereby the United States exercises its
governmental powers are exempt from taxation by the
States, and that the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the States exert the governmental powers
belonging to them are equally exempt from taxation by
the United States. This principle is implied from the
independence of the national and state governments
within their respective spheres and from the provisions
of the Constitution which look to the maintenance of the
dual system. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125, 127;
Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 224-225. Where the
principle applies it is not affected by the amount of the
particular tax or the extent of the resulting interference,
but is absolute. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,
430; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 17 Wall.
322, 327; Johnson v. Maryland, 254 U. S. 51, 55-56; 1
'Respecting the immunity from state taxes this Court there said:
"With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how
universal and undiscriminating, the State's inability to interfere
has been regarded as established since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316. The decision in that case was not put upon any consideration of degree but upon the entire absence of power on the
part of the States to touch, in that way at least, the instnmentalities of the United States; 4 Wheat. 429, 430; and that is the law
today. Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S.

Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44-46.
Of course, the reasons underlying the principle mark
the limits of its range. Thus, as to persons or corporations which serve as agencies of government, national or
state, and also have private property or engage on their
own account in business for gain, it is well settled that
the principle does not extend to their private property or
private business, but only to their operations or acts as
such agencies; I and, in harmony with this view, it also
has been held where a State departs from her usual governmental functions and "engages in a business which
is of a private nature," no immunity arises in respect of
her own or her agents' operations in that business.8
While these decisions show that the immunity does not
extend to anything lying outside or beyond governmental
functions and their exertion, other decisions to which we
now shall refer show that it does extend to all that lies
within that field.
It has been adjudged that bonds of the United States
issued to raise money for governmental purposes, and the
interest thereon, are immune from state taxation, because
such a tax, even though inconsiderable in amount and imposed only on holders of the bonds, would burden the exercise by the United States of its power to borrow money.

include bonds of a municipal corporation in a Territory
issued to raise money for municipal purposes, the decision
being put on the ground that such a corporation is an instrumentality of the United States exercising delegated
governmental powers. Farmers & Mechanics Savings
Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 525. It also has been
adjudged that bonds of municipal corporations in the several States issued to raise money for public municipal
purposes, and the interest thereon, are immune from federal taxation, and this on the ground that such corporations are representatives of the States and exercise some
of their powers, and that under the implications of the
Constitution the governmental agencies and operations of
the States have the same immunity from federal taxation
that like agencies and operations of the United States
have from taxation by the States. Pollock v. Farmers
Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 584-586, 601, 652, 653;
s. c. 158 U. S. 601, 618, 693.
It has been further adjudged that the salary of an officer of the United States is immune from state taxation
because the salary is the "means by which his services are
procured and retained" and its taxation by a State would
burden the exertion by the United States of powers belonging to the latter. Dobbins v. Commissioner of Erie
County, 16 Pet. 435, 448, 449. And "for like reasons" it
has been held that the salary of a state officer is immune
from federal taxation. Collectorv.Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124.
Other applications of the principle are shown in cases
where it has been ruled that a state excise on the transmission of telegrams is void as to messages sent by officers
of the United States on public business, because the excise,

extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow before
it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract. The
extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government.

although exacted only of the telegraph company, is, so
far as it is based on the government messages, a tax on
the means employed by the United States in carrying its
constitutional powers into effect, Western Union Tel. Co.
v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, 466; Williams v. Talladega, 226
U. S.404, 418L-419; and that bonds exacted by a municipal
corporation of a State as a condition to granting licenses
the issue of which is committed by the State to such corporation cannot be taxed by the United States, even
though the tax be collected only from the licensees, because such a tax would burden the exercise of a function
belonging to the State and city in their governmental
capacity, Ambrosini v. United States, 187 U. S.1, 8.
In PanhandleOil Co. v. Knox, 277 U. S.218, this Court
was called upon to determine whether a state excise laid
on the sale of gasoline, and collected only from the dealer
making the sale, could be applied to sales to the United
States for the use of its coast guard fleet and its veterans'
hospital, and the ruling, made after much consideration,
was that the excise could not be so applied consistently
with the constitutional principle. The Court there held
that while a State may impose a tax on a dealer "for the
privilege of carrying on trade that is subject to the power
of the State," she may not lay any tax on sales to the
United States by which it "secures the things desired for
its governmental purposes," and further [p. 222]:
"It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser
is required to report and make payment to the State.
Sale and purchase constitute a transaction by which the
tax is measured and on which the burden rests. . . . To
use the number of gallons sold the United States as a
measure of the privilege tax is in substance and legal effect
to tax the sale. [Citing cases.] And that is to tax the
United States-to exact tribute on its transactions and
apply the same to the support of the State."

INDIAN MOTOCYCLE CO. v. U. S.
570

579

Opinion of the Court.

We think it follows from these decisions, particularly
from the one last cited, that the sale of motorcycles to a
state agency, such as a municipal corporation, for use in
its police service is not subject to taxation by the United
States. The maintenance of a police service by such a
state agency, like the maintenance of a coast guard service by the United States, is a governmental function; and
that function extends-in one instance as much as in the
other-to the purchase of equipment and supplies needed
to render the particular service efficient. Under the constitutional principle the exertion of such a function by a
State or a state agency has the same immunity from federal taxation that like exertions by the United States or
its agencies have from state taxation. Here the tax is
laid directly on the sale to a governmental state agency of
an article purchased for governmental purposes. The
sale and purchase constitute a single transaction, in which
the purchaser is an essential participant. Without that
participation the sale could not be effected. Thus, the
transaction falls within the class which the United Stales
cannot tax consistently with the constitutional principle.
The decisions in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S.
514, 526; Wheeler Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United
States, 281 U. S. 572, 579; and Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S.
216, 225 et seq., cited by counsel for the Government, are
all distinguishable, for the taxes there in question were
not laid on transactions involving an exertion of governmental functions and their bearing on governmental operations was so indirect or remote as to place them outside the principle which is applicable here.
The question propounded in the certificate is answered
in the negative.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES regards Panhandle Oil Co. v.
Knox as controlling in principl and upon that ground acquiesces in this decision.

MR. JUSTICE STONE,

283U.S.

dissenting.

I think the question should be answered in the affirmative. The implied immunity of one government, either
national or state, from taxation by the other should not
be enlarged. Immunity of the one necessarily involves
curtailment of the other's sovereign power to tax. The
practical effect of enlargement is commonly to relieve
individuals from a tax, at the expense of the government
imposing it, without substantial benefit to the government
for whose theoretical advantage the immunity is invoked.
Compare Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514,
522-4; South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437,
455; Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 30-31; see also
Missouri v. Gehner, 281 U. S. 313, 323; Macallen Co. v.
Massachusetts, 279 U. S. 620, 637.
This is especially the case where, as here, the sole
ground of the immunity is that, although the tax is an
excise collected by one government from an individual
normally subject to it, the incidence of the tax may conceivably be shifted to the other government. In such a
case it is not clear how a recovery by the taxpayer would
benefit directly the government supposed to be burdened;
and the assumption of indirect benefit in the case of a tax
of this type necessarily rests upon speculation rather than
reality. See Lash's Products Co. v, United States, 278
U. S. 175. It is significant that neither the federal nor
any state government has appeared by intervention or
otherwise to support this claim of immunity in cases in
which the taxpayer has urged it upon us.
The court has many times held, and as recently as in
EducationalFilms Corp. v. Ward, 282 U. S. 379, that an excise tax, imposed directly on the individual, is not invalid
because indirectly it may burden either the state or the national government. See also Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S.
216, 225; Denman v. Slayton, 282 U. S. 514. A bequest

to the United States or a state may be subjected to an inheritance tax by the other, United States v. Perkins, 163
U. S. 625; Snyder v. Bettman, 190 U. S. 249; see Greiner
v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384, although the consequent indirect burden is apparent. Even if it could be said that
there is some reason, which the Court has never attempted to state, for the distinction which was made by
the decision in PanhandleOil Co. v. Mississippi,277 U. S.
218, between an excise on sales to a government and one
on legacies, the fact of the shifting of the burden would
seem to be at least less apparent in the case of a sale.
In the PanhandleOil case, it was held that this shifting
of the burden of a state tax from the seller to the buyer
was sufficient to render the tax invalid where the buyer
was an agency of the United States, and it was assumed
that the burden of the sales tax involved was so inevitably
passed on to the buyer as to require this result. With this
assumption economists would not, I believe, generally
agree. Many hold that whether the burden of any tax
paid by the seller is actually passed on to the buyer depends upon considerations so various and complex as to
preclude the assumption a priorithat any particular tax at
any particular time is passed on.1 In some conditions of
the market, the burden remains with the seller, or even
may be shifted back from the seller to the producer by the
reduction of the producer's price, rather than forward to
the consumer by an increase of the seller's price.2

Whatever factors determine whether the burden does in
fact shift, I do not think it can be said that a tax paid by
the seller in any given case necessarily burdens the purchaser either more or less, because in form laid on the
sale, as in the PanhandleOil case, or upon transportation
of goods sold f. o. b. destination, as in Wheeler Lumber
Co. v. United States, 281 U. S. 572, or on manufacture
alone of articles intended for sale, see Cornell v. Coyne,
192 U. S. 418, or on both manufacture and sale.
These considerations are, to me, persuasive that the
broad rule announced in the PanhandleOil case ought not
to be extended, even if we were not required by our own
decisions to limit it; and that we ought not to strain the
words of the statute to bring this case within the authority of that one. It seems to be conceded that if the tax
in the present case were levied on manufacture alone, we
would be bound to hold it valid, Cornell v. Coyne, supra;
see Lash's Products Co. v. United States, supra.
The rule of the PanhandleOil case has been limited in
Wheeler Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, holding that
a tax on transportation, which in that case was necessary
to effect delivery by the seller, was valid because not in
terms a tax on the sale, as it was in the former. Even if
verbal distinction, unfounded in economic realities, must
be made between the two cases so that both may stand
as authoritative expositions of the Constitution, consid432; id., 1920, pp. 175-176, 179, 212, 266; id., 1922, pp. 108-109; id.,

erations of substance rather than of form should lead us
to choose that one which would restrict the doctrine of
the Panhandle Oil case to the tax imposed in unqualified
terms on sales to which it was applied in that case. The
present tax is not levied in such terms, exclusively on
sales, but is effective only when the seller both manufactures or imports and sells. With respect to the incidence
of its burden on the buyer, so far as we can know, it does
not differ from a tax on the manufacture of goods, payable when sold. See Lash's Products Co. v. United
States, supra. I think that the Wheeler Lumber case,
rather than the PanhandleOil case, should control in determining its validity.

No. 263.

Submitted March 12, 1931.-Decided May 25, 1931.

1. Section 1324 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, in allowing interest
on refunds of internal revenue taxes if the amount refunded was
paid by the taxpayer "under a specific protest setting forth in
detail the basis of and reasons for such protest," seeks to recoup
taxpayers who have been unjustly dealt with. The purpose of the
protest is to invite attention of the taxing officers to the illegality

and meticulous compliance by the taxpayer with the prescribed conditions must appear before he can recover. P. 588.
2. This provision is inapplicable where an excess-profits tax, as re.
turned and paid, was lawfully demanded, but was reduced and in
part refunded, not under a protest, but as the result of written
requests for a reassessment proportioned to the taxes of other representative concerns engaged in like business. Revenue Act of 1917,
