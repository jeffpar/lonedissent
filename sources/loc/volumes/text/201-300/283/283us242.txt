MR. JusTicE BUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The company sued the collector in the district court,
southern district of New York, to recover capital stock
taxes exacted under §1000 (c) of the Revenue Act of
19181 for four years ending June 30, 1922. A jury was
waived and the case was submitted on an agreed statement
of facts. The court held the taxes for the first three years
were rightly collected and as to the causes of action alleged
on account of them dismissed the complaint. It held that,
I (c)

" . . . The taxes imposed by this section shall apply to

mutual insurance companies, and in the case of every such domestic
company the tax shall be equivalent to $1 for each $1,000 of the

excess over $5,000 of the sum of its surplus or contingent reserves
maintained for the general use of the business and any reserves the
net additions to which are included in net income under the provisions of Title II, as of the close of the preceding accounting period
used by such company for purposes of making its income tax return .

OCTOBER TERM. 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

by reason of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 261,
the capital stock tax did not apply to the last year, and
gave plaintiff judgment for the amount paid for that
period. 34 F. (2d) 60. On the company's appeal (No. 93
here) and the collector's cross-appeal (No. 160) the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 39 F.

(2d) 556.
The company is a New York corporation without capital stock engaged in mutual life insurance on the level
premium plan. It made a return for each of the years
showing no tax. After auditing the returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed the taxes in question.By means of an accepted mortality table and an assumed rate of interest, the company calculates the amount
that would be required to be paid by the insured each
year in advance to cover policy claims if deaths occur as
indicated by the table and if that rate of interest is realized
on the investments. The amount so ascertained is called
the net or mathematical premium. There is added loading to cover expenses and unforeseen contingencies such
as excess mortality, diminished interest, investment losses
and higher taxes. The premium so built up is named in
the policy and constitutes the maximum that the company may require the insured to pay.
The amount by which the premium exceeds the company's actual cost must be returned to the policyholder.
Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Lederer, 252 U. S. 523, 525.
Some of the company's policies are on the annual dividend
plan, which requires it to account for divisible surplus and
to make yearly distribution to the policyholders. The
other policies are on the deferred dividend plan and provide for holding the overpayments to the credit of the
deferred dividend policyholders as a class, accumulating
them at interest and paying to each holder of a policy in
force at the time designated therein his share of the
accumulated sum.

NEW YORK LIFE INS. CO. v. BOWERS.

245

Opinion of the Court.

As soon as practicable after the expiration of each calendar year, the company takes an account of its business,
ascertains the surplus earned that year, and determines
the amount which safely may be distributed out of the
surplus for that and prior years. By the laws of New
York and of other States where the company does business, it is required annually to file a statement showing,
among other things, income and disbursements in, and its
assets and liabilities at the end of, the preceding year.
Item 35 on the form used shows dividends'apportioned
and payable to annual dividend policyholders, to and including December 31 following. Item 36 covers dividends apportioned and payable to deferred dividend policies in the same period. Item 37 shows the amounts set
apart, apportioned, provisionally ascertained, calculated,
declared or held awaiting apportionment upon deferred
dividend policies not included in item 36.
Section 1000 (c) imposes a tax on each mutual insurance company's "surplus or contingent reserves maintained for the general use of the business." The Commissioner based the capital stock taxes for each year on the
total of items 35, 36 and 37 as disclosed by the company's
annual statements filed for the years ending respectively
December 31, 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920.
1. These items represent surplus within the meaning of
subdivision (c).
The sums to be paid as dividends are not a part of the
insurance specified in the policies. They are derived
from amounts which, from abundant caution, are included
in the advance premiums over and above what is found
by actual experience to be necessary to pay the cost of the
insurance and the expenses of carrying on the business.
They indicate a "surplus," i. e., assets in excess of what
is deemed necessary to provide for the payment when due
of the amounts specifically covered by the policies.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

No money or property is set aside on account of such
dividends. The items in question do not constitute liabilities. They are merely accounting entries to show the
amounts presently available for dividends currently payable and as well the fund accumulated in respect of deferred dividends. Such entries are analogous to those in
balance sheets of business corporations which show capital
stock as a liability. And until actually paid out as dividends the money or securities used for that purpose properly may be deemed to be maintained for "the general
use of the business."
Under the company's construction of subdivision (c)it
was not liable for the tax for any year while the 1918 Act
was in force. According to its returns it had no "surplus
or contingent reserves." The company does not suggest
and there is no reason to suppose that, in respect of assets
properly so to be classed, it is not typical of mutual insurance companies generally. When regard is had to the
well-known and necessary practice of mutual insurance
companies to collect in advance premiums in excess of
total costs and to pay dividends out of the resulting surplus it is clear that the company's construction is unreasonable. It would operate to defeat the plainly expressed
purpose of Congress to impose a, capital stock tax on
mutual insurance companies.
2. The company contends that in any event subdivision
(b) of § 1000 requires that item 37 be excluded from the
amount used to measure the excise.
That provision is: "In computing the tax in the case
of insurance companies such deposits and reserve funds as
they are required by law or contract to maintain or hold
for the protection of or payment to or apportionment
among policyholders shall not be included." The legislative history of § 1000 goes far to make its meaning clear.
Section 407 of the 1916 Act imposed upon corporations a
special excise measured by the value of their capital stock.

Opinion of the Court.

39 Stat. 789. Its scope was not clear. At first the Treasury Department ruled that as mutual insurance companies
have no capital stock the section did not apply to them.
Regulations 38, Art. 2 (b). That construction was later
reversed. Regulations 38 (Revised) Art. 3. And see
Lumber FireIns. Co. v. Malley, 44 F. (2d) 553.
In the bill for the Revenue Act of 1918 as it passed the
House, § 1000 was substantially the same as § 407 of the
1916 Act. The Senate substituted provisions to tax the
incomes of insurance companies. In conference, the original § 1000 was restored, and there was added to it the
provision in paragraph (c) which specifically declares that
the taxes imposed by that section shall apply to mutual
insurance companies. The provision added was complete
in itself. It specified the rate and indicated the basis
on which the tax was to be calculated; it was adequate to
govern the ascertainment of the amount and there is
nothing to indicate an intention that the language there
used should be modified by anything in subdivision (b).
It is clear that (c) was intended exclusively to govern
mutual insurance companies, and that (b) applies only
to stock insurance companies.
3. The company insists that § 1000 of the 1918 Act did
not impose a tax for the year ending June 30, 1921.
The Treasury Department ruled that the taxes imposed
by § 407 of the 1916 Act were payable in advance for the
year commencing July 1 and that construction was followed while the section remained in force. Undoubtedly
Congress intended that the same rule should be followed
under the substitute provision, § 1000 of the 1918 Act.
And the Treasury Department so construed it. The 1918
Act was not approved until February 24, 1919. The year
commencing July 1, 1918, was the first for which it imposed the capital stock tax. See Hecht v. Malley, 265
U. S. 144, 163. And this company's annual statement for
1917 was the basis on which the Commissioner made his

calculations. The legislative history and the administrative construction make it clear that such taxes were payable in advance.2
The taxes for the third year under the 1918 Act were
calculated on the insurance company's annual statement
for the calendar year 1919 and were payable in advance
for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1920. There is
nothing in the 1921 Act, which was not approved until
November 23, to suggest that Congress intended that capital stock taxes so payable in 1920 were to be returned if
already paid or canceled if delinquent. The company was
rightly held for that year's tax.
4. The collector maintains that despite the 1921 Act
the company is liable under § 1000 of the 1918 Act for the
capital stock tax for the year ending June 30, 1922.
Section 243 of the 1921 Act imposes a tax upon the net
income of every insurance company for the calendar year
1921 and each taxable year thereafter. It declares that
tax to be in lieu of other taxes imposed by that Act,
namely income taxes on corporations generally, § 230,
capital stock taxes, § 1000, and profits taxes, Title III.
Section 1400 (a) repealed, to take effect January 1, 1922,
Title X of the 1918 Act, which includes § 1000. Section
1400 (b) provides: "In the case of any tax imposed by
any part of the Revenue Act of 1918 repealed by this Act,
if there is a tax imposed by this Act in lieu thereof, the
provision [of the 1918 Act] imposing such tax shall remain in force until the corresponding tax under this Act
takes effect." The income tax imposed by § 243 is declared
to be in lieu of capital stock tax in § 1000 of the same Act.

Syllabus.

And, as the latter tax was in lieu of the capital stock tax
imposed by § 1000 of the 1918 Act, it reasonably may be
said that the income tax imposed by § 243 was intended
to be in lieu of the capital stock tax of § 1000 of the 1918
Act.
This income tax was one" corresponding" to the capital
stock tax under § 1000 of the 1918 Act within the meaning of § 1400 (b). And under that provision the last
mentioned tax remained in force until the former took
effect. The income tax imposed by § 243 was "for the
calendar year 1921." Section 1400 (b) makes it plain
that there was no intention to subject insurance companies
to both taxes for the same period. The 1921 Act operated
to cancel or remit the capital stock tax for that year. The
company is entitled to recover the amount collected for
that period.
