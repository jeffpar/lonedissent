1. Alien held liable to deportation, on the authority of Philippides v.
Day, ante, p. 48.

Mr. Claude R. Branch,Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Attorney General Mitchell, Assistant
Attorney General Dodds, Messrs. Albert E. Reitzel and
B. W. Butler, Assistant Solicitors, Department of Labor,
Harry S. Ridgely, and Erwin N. Griswold were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Erwin I. Feldman, with whom Mr. J. Edward Keating was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case raises the same question as No. 92, ante, p. 48,
but, as stated in No. 92, was decided the other way by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Zaja is a
Dalmatian, citizen of Jugo-Slavia. He shipped as a seaman upon an Italian ship and on its arrival at San Pedro,
California, deserted the ship on January 25, 1925. He
was arrested on October 4, 1928, more than three years
after his entry, and after a hearing was ordered to be deported on the same ground as in No. 92. He obtained a

writ of habeas corpus and was ordered to be discharged
fronr custody. 37 F. (2d) 1016. The judgment must be
reversed for the reasons given in No. 92. It is objected
that the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals was not
stayed, but was issued to the District Court and spread
upon its records and that therefore the case is finished.
But that does not defeat the jurisdiction of this Court.
The Conqueror, 166 U. S. 110, 113. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Behlmer, 169 U. S. 644, 648. Rule 45.

FLYNN, EXECUTOR, v. NEW YORK, NEW HAVEN,
& HARTFORD RAILROAD COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS OF
CONNECTICUT.
No. 235.

Argued March 12, 1931.-Decided March 23, 1931.

The Employers' Liability Act gives a right of action to the employee,
or, in case of his death, to his personal representative for the
benefit of the widow and children, and provides that no action
shall be maintained unless commenced within two years from the
day the cause of action accrued. Held that the right of the
representative is derivative and depends upon the continuance of a
right in the injured employee at the time of his death, so that
where the right of the employee was extinguished before he died,
by the lapse of the prescribed period, there was no right in his
executor, on behalf of his widow and children. P. 56.
111 Conn. 196; 149 Atl. 682, affirmed.

Mr. William F. Geenty, with whom Messrs. Thomas R.

Fitzsimmons and William A. Bree were on the brief, for
petitioner.
The statute of limitations begins to run at the time of
