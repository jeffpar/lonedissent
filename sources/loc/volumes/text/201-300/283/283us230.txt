OCTOBER TERM. 1930.
Statement of the Case.

283 U.S.

H. Conner, Special Assistants to the Attorney General,
Erwin N. Griswold, and Clarence M. Charest, General
Counsel, and Allin H. Pierce, Special Attorney, Bureau of
Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. William Clarke Mason, with whom Mr. John Russell, Jr., was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question in this case is the same as that which has
been determined against the respondent in Burnet v.
Houston, ante, p. 223. The subscription to the fund described in our opinion in that case was not made by respondent direct, but by her brother, Samuel F. Houston,
acting as her agent. Otherwise the facts are the same; and
upon the authority of the Houston case the judgment of
the court below, 39 F. (2d) 358, is
Reversed.

Argued March 12, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, after approving a deduction for loss in an income tax return and allowing a claim for refund of the proportional part of the tax, had authority to reopen
the case later, disallow the deduction and redetermine the tax.
2. Decided, as respects proof of deductible loss, upon the authority of
Burnet v. Houston, ante, p..223.
39 F. (2d) 360, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 282 U. S. 821, to review a judgment which
reversed a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 13
B. T. A. 279, sustaining disallowance of a deduction for
a loss, in an income tax return.

Syllabus.

Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher and Messrs. Sewall Key and
A. H. Conner, Special Assistants to the Attorney General,
Erwin N. Griswold, and Clarence M. Charest, General
Counsel, and Allin H. Pierce, Special Attorney, Bureau
of Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Walter Lee Sheppard, with whom Mr. William C.
Alexander, Jr., was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
William W. Porter was a subscriber in the sum of
$75,000 to the fund described in our opinion handed down
this day in Burnet v. Houston, ante, p. 223. The facts in
the present case are the same except that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue first approved the deduction
and allowed a claim for refund of the proportional part of
the tax, and then some time later reopened the case, disallowed the deduction and redetermined the tax. The
court of appeals sustained the power of the commissioner
upon the authority of McIlhenny v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 39 F. (2d) 356; and was clearly right in
doing so. That court, however, upon the main point, following its decision in the Houston case, reversed the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals in favor of the
government. 39 F. (2d) 360. This is contrary to our
decision in the Houston case, and upon that authority the
judgment is
Reversed.
