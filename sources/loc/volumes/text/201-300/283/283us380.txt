APPEALS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

Nos. 470, 471, 472.

Argued April 23, 24, 1931.-Decided May 18,
1931.

1. The power of a State to compel interstate carriers to construct a
union passenger station in a city is not superseded by the Interstate Commerce Act, except that the approval of the Interstate

Commerce Commission must first be obtained, and its certificate of
public convenience and necessity issued, with respect to rearrangement, extension and abandonment of tracks, and the use of the
terminal facilities, involved in the proposed plan. P. 390.
2. An Act of Congress regulating a subject of interstate commerce to a
limited extent is not to be taken as impliedly superseding state authority over matters not covered by it unless, fairly interpreted, it
is in conflict with the state regulation. P. 392.
3. The power of the Commission to issue a certificate authorizing construction, acquisition, extension and abandonment of railroads
(Interstate Commerce Act, § 1, pars. 18-21), may be invoked not
only by carriers but also by a State seeking to require carriers to
construct a union passenger station terminal involving readjustments of trackage. P. 393.
4. An order of a state commission requiring railroads to construct a
union passenger station in a large city, at large expense, held not
repugnant to the due process or the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the full hearings given by the
state and federal commissions and facts showing the inadequacy

The State Commission's order as to joint use of main
lines and terminal facilities and connections between main
lines is void because it involves the attempted exercise
of a power which has been expressly vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission. Par. 4, § 3; Alabama Ry.

The order of the State Commission cannot be validated
by certificates issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. There cannot be a divided authority between
the two commissions. Missouri Pac. R: Co. v. Stroud,
267 U. S. 404, 408..
Paragraphs 18, 19, and 20, of § 1 empower the Federal Commission to issue certificates only on application of carriers, Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Gulf Ry.
Co., 270 U. S. 266, 272; Chicago, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co.
v. United States, 275 U. S. 404, 408.
The purpose of paragraphs 18 to 20 was to protect
interstate commerce from undue burdens or discrimination, Coloradov. United States, 271 U. S. 153; to prevent
carriers from weakening themselves by constructing or
operating superfluous lines and to protect them from
being weakened by another carrier constructing a competing line not required in the public interest. Texas
Ry. Co. v. Northside Belt Ry. Co., 276 U. S. 475.
The proceedings in Congress show that applications
under paragraphs 18 to 20 were intended to be made by
the carriers. See MacVeagh, "Transportation Act,
1920," pp. 220, 221, 222.
When Congress intended that proceedings against carriers might be taken by the Commission on complaint
or on its own motion, such intention is clearly expressed.
Paragraph 21 of § 1 does not give the Commission authority to issue the certificates. United States v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 242 U. S. 208; Second Los Angeles Case,

Argument for Appellants.

Unless the phrase "and to extend their lines" is limited to car service, there would seem to be no standard
set by the Act for the guidance of the Commission in
exercising its powers as to extensions. Such a standard
must be found in the Act. Union Bridge Co. v. United
States, 204 U. S.364, 384, 385; United States v. Chicago,
M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 282 U. S. 311.
If the phrase "and to extend their lines" were intended
to confer upon, the Interstate Commerce Commission
the power to compel extensions other than those needed
to provide "car service," it would impose a construction
on the Act which at once raises grave constitutional questions under the Fifth Amendment. Such a construction
will be avoided. United States v. Delaware Co., 213 U. S.
366, 407-8; Texas v. United States, 258 U. S. 204.
The State Commission's order deprives the railroads of
their property without due process of law and denies
them the equal protection of the laws, and takes their
property for public use without just compensation, in
contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Northern Pac. R. Co. v. North Dakota, 236

Comm., 192 Cal. 307, sustain the contention that the
California Railroad Commission has never had power
under the state statute within constitutional limitation
to require railroads to acquire and dedicate to public use
lands and rights of way, extend their main lines of railroad to reach territory which they have not undertaken
to serve, and to comply with the other requirements of
the State Commission's order.

the reserved power to amend, alter or repeal charters.

The absolute duties of the railroads are limited to furnishing reasonable and adequate facilities to their several
patrons. If a station is too small a railroad may be required to enlarge it. If a station burns down a railroad
may be required to replace it. These are matters within
the realm of regulation under the police power. These
are but carrying out obligations incurred when it entered
upon the field of its activity. But to require a railroad
company to abandon its own adequate facilities and to
go elsewhere than on its own property and acquire additional land and construct new facilities to be used jointly
by itself and other railroad companies, is outside the
realm of regulation, and impairs constitutional rights.
The railroads are denied their constitutional rights by
failure of the State Commission to provide compensation
for the use of their railroad properties by one another.

appellees.
Messrs. Erwin P. Werner, Milton Bryan, Max Thelen,

Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
These are appeals from judgments of the Supreme Court
of California, which affirmed an order of the Railroad
Commission of that State requiring the appellants to construct a union passenger station in the City of Los Angeles,
together with incidental connections, extensions, improvements and terminal facilities, in substantial compliance
with the plan outlined by the Commission. 209 Cal. 460;
288 Pac. 775.
Proceedings were begun before the State Railroad Commission in the year 1916, and in December, 1921, after two
hearings, the Railway Companies were required to remove
certain grade crossings and to build a union terminal within a defined area known as the Plaza site in Los Angeles.
19 Op. R. R. Coin. Cal. 740; 20 id. 937. The Supreme
Court of the State held that the order was beyond the
power of the Commission, because the subject matter had
been committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission
by the Transportation Act of 1920. 190 Cal. 214; 211

Opinion of the Court.

Pac. 460. The judgment was affirmed by this Court.
264 U. S. 331. The Court held that the relocation of
tracks, which was incidental to the proposed union station,
required a certificate of approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission under paragraphs 18 to 21 of § 1 of the
Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 476-478), as a condition precdent to the validity of any action by the carriers or of
any order by the State Railroad Commission.1
Pending the consideration of that case, a proceeding
was instituted before the Interstate Commerce Commission by the City of Los Angeles to obtain an order requiring the three Railway Companies to build the union
station at the designated place. That Commission decided, July 6, 1925 (100 I. C. C. 421), that it was without
authority to require the construction of the station. But,
in order to facilitate the disposition of the case, the Commission made certain hypothetical certificates substantially as follows:2
" (1) That the public convenience and necessity require
the extensions of lines that may be necessary to reach
and serve any union passenger station within the plaza
which may be constructed in accordance with a lawful
order of the State Commission and that may be necessary
to provide for the incidental rearrangement of passenger
and freight routes, and that the expense involved will not
impair the carriers' ability to perform their duties to the
public. (2) That public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment of train service on Alameda Street
and such other abandonments of lines as would be necessary in connection with the establishment of any such

station, so lawfully ordered by the State Commission.
The report further found that such joint use of track or
other terminal facilities as may be incidental and necessary to the proper operation of any such union station is in
the public interest and is practicable, without substantially impairing the owning carriers' ability to handle their
own business."
In reaching its conclusion, the Interstate Commerce
Commission made an extended review of the question of
the expense involved, stating that "if a union station
were built at the Plaza under substantially the plan presented by the California Commission, the new money
necessary to be raised, less the value of property released
from passenger service, would be about $5,500,000. The
total investment in passenger facilities under the Plaza
plan would approximate $9,500,000." 100 I. C. C., p. 457.
After setting forth its findings upon the record before
it, the Commission reserved jurisdiction for the purpose of
making such further findings and orders, and issuing such
certificates, as should be warranted in the event that the
plan of the State Commission as finally evolved should
be materially different from that "as here considered to
be in the public interest." Id., p. 461.
Following this action of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the proceeding before the State Commission was
reopened. The action of the Federal Commission was
submitted, hearings were had at which evidence was received, and, on July 8, 1927, the State Commission made
the order, which was the subject of the judgments now
under review, requiring the building of the station within
the Plaza area and the establishment of the connections,
additions and facilities which that project involved. The
State Commission found that "the present and future
public convenience and necessity" required the construction of the union station, and that it could be constructed
at a cost of approximately $10,000,000 in substantial corn-

pliance with the plan outlined, which was found to be in
all essential respects similar to that considered by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in its order above mentioned. 30 Op. R. R. Com. Cal. 151.
Petitions for final order were then presented by the
City of Los Angeles and the State Commission to the
Interstate Commerce Commission. After further hearing the latter Commission made its report, on May 8, 1928,
adhering to the conclusions of its former report that
"public convenience and necessity" required the extension by the Railway Companies of their respective main
lines in the City of Los Angeles "so as to reach and serve
a union passenger station and terminal which they may
construct in the Plaza district," pursuant to order of the
State Commission to that effect, with "the abandonment
of other portions of main lines to provide for incidental
rearrangement of routes, and the abandonment of train
service on Alameda Street," and that "such joint use is
in the public interest and practicable, without impairing
the ability of the carrier or carriers owning or entitled to
the enjoyment of such track or tracks to handle its or their
own business." The Interstate Commerce Commission
issued its certificate accordingly, but the petition for the
issue of an order requiring the Railway Companies to construct a union station was denied. 142 I. C. C. 489.
Application was then made to the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel
the Interstate Commerce Commission to consider the evidence introduced before it for the purpose of determining
whether the Commission should order the Railway Companies to build the union station, and, after consideration
of the evidence, to make such an order as the facts required. Dismissal of that petition was reversed by the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and, upon
writ of certiorari, this Court reversed the judgment of
the Court of Appeals. This Court held that the Congress

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

283 U.S.

had not conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to require the building of the station.
280 U. S. 52.
Referring to its former decision, the Court said (id.,
p. 71): "The only issue there presented to this Court,
was whether it was.necessary to secure from the Interstate Commerce Commission its approval of the construction of a union station and the relocation of the connecting tracks proposed. The point in that case was the necessity for the acquiescence by the Interstate Commerce
Commission in respect to a union passenger station. We
held such a certificate to be necessary before a union station or connecting lines of interstate carriers could be
lawful. That is all we held."
Thereupon, the Railway Companies petitioned the Supreme Court of the State to review the order of the State
Commission requiring the construction of the station, and
that court entered the judgments of affirmance from which
these appeals have been taken.
The questions presented are solely those of constitutional authority. All questions of fact as to public convenience and necessity, and as to the practicability of
the proposed plan, have been resolved against the Railway Companies by the proper tribunals. This Court has
held that the State Commission could not require the construction of the proposed station, and the relocation of
connecting tracks, without the approval of the Interstate
Commerce Commission. That approval has been given.
This Court has also decided that the Interstate Commerce
Commission has not been empowered to require the building of the station. That Commission has not attempted
to exercise any such authority. The question now is as
to the authority of the State Commission, in view of the
action of the Federal Commission, to require the construction of the station with the incidental arrangement
of tracks and facilities. The decision of the state court

ATCHISON RY. v. RAILROAD COMM.
380

391

Opinion of the Court.

is conclusive so far as the constitution and laws of the
State are concerned. The State Commission has acted
within the power conferred upon it. The only questions
before us are those arising under the Federal Constitution and the Interstate Commerce Act.
First. The Railway Companies contend that the order
of the State Commission is repugnant to the commerce
clause and is in conflict with the powers vested by the
Congress in the Interstate Commerce Commission. The
argument is that as to union terminal facilities, joint use
of tracks and abandonment of lines, the Congress has
occupied the field and that state authority has been abrogated. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Washington, 222
U. S. 370; PennsylvaniaR. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 250 U. S. 566; Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S.
153; Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Jackson & Eastem Ry. Co., 271 U. S. 244; Missouri Pacific R. Co. v.
Porter,273 U. S. 341. The contention presupposes that
state authority could be exerted were it not for the provisions of the federal legislation. That is, that it was
the intention of Congress to prevent the exercise of state
power in this matter of serious public interest, although
no authority was given to the Federal Commission to meet
the public need. Such an intention to override existing
state authority to deal with local exigencies is not to be
imputed to the Congress unless its enactment compels that
conclusion. In deciding that the Congress had given to
the Interstate Commerce Commission no power to require
the building of such a union terminal as that projected
in this case, this Court adverted to the extent of the
authority that would be involved and the effect of its
exercise upon local interests. The Court said (280 U. S.
pp. 68, 69):
"Such authority, if conferred in Los Angeles, would
have application to all interstate railroad junctions, including the numerous large cities of the country, with their

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

2S3 U.S.

residential, commercial, shopping, and municipal centers
now fixed and established with relation to existing terminals. It would become a statute of the widest effect and
would enter into the welfare of every part of the country.
Various interests would be vitally affected by the substitution of a union station for th6 present terminals. A
selection of its site from the standpoint of a city might
greatly affect property values and likewise local transportation systems. The exercise of such power would compel the carriers to abandon existing terminals, to acquire
new land and rights of way and enter upon new construction, to abandon large tracts and to sell territory of the
same extent as no longer necessary for the use of the carriers.
"There would have to be tribunals to apportion the
expenditures and cost as between the carriers. A proper
statute would seem to require detailed directions, and we
should expect the intention to be manifested in plain
terms and not to have been left to be implied from varied
regulatory provisions of uncertain scope. It would be a
monumental work and one requiring the most extensive
exercise of expert engineering and railroad construction.
It would make possible great changes of much impor-.
tance in the plans of every city and in the rearrangement
and mutations of railroad property and public and private
business structures everywhere. We find no statutory
preparation for the organization of such machinery."
The considerations which led the Court to the conclusion that the power to compel the construction of such
terminals had been withheld from the Federal Commission also make it clear that the authority which resided
in the State had not been taken away except to the extent
that the approval of the Federal Commission was required. The principle thus applicable has been frequently stated. It is that the Congress may circumscribe
its regulation and occupy a limited field, and that the

ATCHISON RY. v. RAILROAD COMM.
380

Opinion of the Court.

intention to supersede the exercise by the State of its
authority as to matters not covered by the federal legislation is not to be implied unless the Act of Congress fairly
interpreted is in conflict with the law of the State. Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 533; Atlantic Coast Line R.
Co. v. Georgia,234 U. S.280, 293, 294; Southern Ry. Co.
v. Railroad Comm., 236 U. S.439, 446; Illinois Central R.
Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 245 U. S.493, 510; Carey
v. South Dakota,250 U. S. 118, 122; Lehigh Valley R. Co.
v. Public Utility Commrs., 278 U. S.24, 35; International
Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, 278 U. S. 261, 265. We find no such
conflict in this case, as the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been obtained, and its certificate
of public convenience and necessity has been issued, in
relation to the rearrangement, extensions and abandonment of tracks, and the use of the terminal facilities, involved in the proposed plan, and nothing further was required by the Interstate Commerce Act.
Second. The appellants further insist that the certificates of the Interstate Commerce Commission are void.
The point is that the certificates were not issued upon the
application of the Railway Companies but in proceedings
adverse to them and over their protest. It is urged that
paragraphs 18 to 20 of § 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act
give the Commission no power to issue such certificates
except upon application of the carriers, and that the certificates were also unauthorized under paragraph 21 of
that section.
The provisions of these paragraphs (18 to 21) contain no such limitation as that suggested. While they
relate "to the construction, acquisition, extension and
abandonment of a railroad," and "deal primarily with
rights sought to be exercised by the carrier" (Cleveland,
Cincinnati,Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States,
275 U. S.404, 408) these paragraphs do not exclude appropriate action by the Commission upon applications by

Opinion of the Court.

233 U.S.

those who have a proper interest in the subject matter,
although they are not carriers. If the State could be
deemed to have no authority to compel the building of
such a union terminal as that here involved, the question
would not arise. But if the State originally had this
authority, and the federal legislation has not superseded
it, but has required, as this Court has held, a certificate
of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate
Commerce Commission as a condition precedent to the
validity of any order on the part of the State Conmnission, we find no warrant for construing the statute as
precluding the application which is necessary to obtain
such a certificate. In its first opinion, this Court said
that it was advised that the City of Los Angeles had filed
a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission
and that the Court thought that the course taken by
the City "was the correct one." 264 U. S. pp. 347, 348.
While the statement was obiter, it intimated an opinion
which has been confirmed by further consideration of the
purpose and terms of the statute. Nothing was said in
the second opinion contrary to that view. The approval
of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the issue
of its certificate of public convenience and necessity being indispensable under the Act, application could properly be made by the authorities of the State, assuming
that with such certificate they were entitled to require
the establishment of the station.
Third. We are thus brought to the contention of the
appellants that the order of the State Commission deprives the Railway Companies of their property without
due process of law, and denies to them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (f the Federal Constitution.
The principle that the State, directly or through an
authorized commission, may require railroad companies

for the building of union stations, as follows (280 U. S., pp. 67, 68):
"There are cases in the state courts in which by virtue of statutory
provision railroads are required expressly to unite in a passenger
station, if determined by Commissioners appointed by the Court or
by a Railroad Commission. Mayor and Aldermen of Worcester v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

Railroad Comm. v. Mobile & Ohio R. Co., supra. The
question in each case is whether, in the light of the facts
disclosed, the regulation is essentially an unreasonable one.
Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific R. Co. v. Jacobson, supra;
Norfolk & Western. Ry. Co. v. Public Service Comm.,
supra. And "the matter of expense is an important criterion to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order." Oregon R. & Nay. Co. v. Fairchild, 224 U. S. 510, 529.
In the present case, careful inquiry has been made into
all the relevant facts. There have been three hearings
before the State Commission and two hearings before the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The inadequacy of
existing facilities has been shown and the relative merits
of various plans have been the subject of elaborate study.
The expense involved in the plan adopted, when considered in relation to the importance of the interests
affected and to be served, does not appear to be so large
as to warrant the condemnation of the plan as unreasonable and beyond the authority of the State. In its second report, pursuant to which the certificate of public
convenience and necessity was issued, the Interstate Commerce Commission said (142 I. C. C., 495, 496):
"It will be observed that our findings of fact in the
original report, previously set out, are in effect duplicated
by findings numbered 1 to 6 of the Railroad Commission
of the State of California in its decision of July 8, 1927,
as appears in Appendix 1 hereto. The State Commission
in addition found (7) that the present and future public
convenience and necessity require and will require the
construction by defendants and each of them of a union
passenger station within that portion of Los Angeles described in the third finding, with the track and other
facilities reasonably necessary, convenient, or incidental
to the use of such passenger station; (8) that in its opin-

Opinion of the Court.

ion an adequate union passenger station could be constructed within the described portion of the city at a cost
of approximately $10,000,000, in substantial compliance
with the plan outlined in its Exhibit 4-B, which is found
to be in all essential respects similar to the plan considered
by us in our original decision and report; (9) that such
plan for a union passenger station in the Plaza portion
of Los Angeles in the opinion of the State Commission
is and would be in the public interest, and that its construction is practicable, without impairing the ability of
the defendants to perform their respective duties to the
public; and (10) that such construction ought reasonably to be made.

.

All of the testimony of rec-

ord in the original proceeding before us was examined
and given careful analysis in our original report. We adhere to the conclusions there expressed, upon a further
consideration of the whole record, including the subsequently imported testimony taken before the California
Commission. In our judgment, the findings of the California Commission numbered 7 to 10, inclusive, as appears in the appendix and as above summarized, find
sufficient support in the record."
We find no basis for the conclusion that the findings of
fact are unsupported by evidence, or that, in view of the
facts thus ascertained, the order of the State Commission
is unreasonable or arbitrary.
In this view, the judgments of the Supreme Court of the
State are affirmed.
Judgments affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed upon the
-ground that the assailed order of the Railroad Commission is arbitrary, unreasonable, and beyond any power
which the State is competent to confer.
