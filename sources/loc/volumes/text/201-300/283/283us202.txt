Statement of the Case.

283 U.S.

Third. The defendant contends that there was no performance within the meaning of the Act because it is not
shown that the hotel operated the receiving set and loudspeakers for profit. Unless such acts were carried on for
profit, there can, of course, be no liability. But whether
there was a performance does not depend upon the existence of the profit motive. The question submitted does
not call for a determination whether the acts of the hotel
company recited in the certificate constitute operation for
profit.
The question certified is answered: Yes.

JEWELL-LASALLE REALTY COMPANY v. BUCK
ET AL.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 140. Argued March 3, 4, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. In a case disclosing infringement of a copyright covering a musical
composition, there being no proof of actual damages, the court is
bound by the minimum amount of $250 set out in the so-called "no
other case" clause of § 25 (b) of the Copyright Act, reading, "and
such damages shall in no other case exceed the swm of $5,000 nor
be less than the sum of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty." P. 203.
2. Where more than twenty-five infringing performances of a copyrighted musical composition have been proved and there is no showing of actual damages, the court must allow the statutory minimum
of $250 and may, in its sound discretion, employ the rate of ten
dollars a performance, which is scheduled in subdivision "Fourth"
of § 25 (b), as a basis for assessing additional damages. P. 208.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Charles M. Blackmar, with whom Mr. Kenneth E.
Midgley was on the brief, for Jewell-LaSalle Realty Company.
Mr. Thomas G. Haight, with whom Messrs. Nathan
Burkan, Louis D. FrOhlich,E. S. Hartman, and Maurice
J. O'Sullivan were on the brief, for Buck et al.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and one of its members sued the Jewell-LaSalle
Realty Company in the federal court for Western Missouri
for an unauthorized orchestral performance of a musical
composition for which they held the exclusive non-dramatic performing rights. The infringement was proved,
but there was no showing of actual damages. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs were entitled to only
$10 statutory damages; the plaintiffs that $250 was the
minimum allowable under the Copyright Act of 1909.
The court granted an injunction and awarded $250 damages, 32 F. (2d) 366, 368. The defendant appealed; and
the Circuit Court of Appeals certified questions numbered
II, III and IV relating to the subject of damages.'
Question II. "In a case disclosing infringement of a
copyright covering a musical composition, there being no
proof of actual damages, is the court bound by the minimum amount of $250 set out in the so-called 'no other
case' clause of Section 25 (b) of the Copyright Act (17
U. S. C., Sec. 25), reading, ' and such damages shall in no
other case exceed the sum of $5,000 nor be less than the
sum of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty?'"
1 The

relief for the infringement was sought in the seventh count
of the bill referred to in No. 139, ante, p. 191. The question here
discussed was raised by a cross-appeal. The several questions presented by Nos. 138, 139 and 140 were embraced in a single certificate.
but separate briefs were filed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The provision referred to is § 25 of the Act of March 4,
1909, c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075, 1081, as amended by the Act
of August 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 488, 489, which provides:
"That if any person shall infringe the copyright in any
work protected under the copyright laws of the United
States such person shall be liable:
"(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages
as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the
infringement, . . . or in lieu of .actual damages and
profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be
just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its
discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated, but
[here follow limitations applicable specifically to newspaper reproductions of photographs, and certain motion
picture infringements of undramatized or nondramatic
work and of copyrighted dramatic or dramatico-musical
work], and such damages shall in no other case exceed the
sum of five thousand dollars nor be less than the sum of
two hundred and fifty dollars, and shall not be regarded
as a penalty. But the foregoing exceptions shall not
deprive the copyright proprietor of any other remedy
given him under this law, nor shall the limitation as to the
amount of recovery apply to infringements occurring after
the actual notice to a defendant, either by service of
process in a suit or other written notice served on him."
Then follows the so-called schedule, of which the
"Fourth

" item is:

"In the case of dramatic or dramatico-musical or a
choral or orchestral composition, one hundred dollars for
the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent infringing
performance; in the case of other musical compositions,
ten dollars for every infringing performance."
The Copyright Act confers two monopolies-that of
making copies and that of giving public performances for
profit. It was settled in Westermann Co. v. Dispatch
PrintingCo., 249 U. S. 100, which dealt with the infringe-

Opinion of the Court.

ment by a newspaper of the monopoly of copying, that
for each publication $250 is the minimum damages. An
unbroken line of decisions in the lower courts has since
held that the rule declared in the Westermann case is
applicable also to infringement of the monopoly of giving
public performances. It is now contended that, as applied to performances, the rule is burdensome and unreasonable; that it was followed unwillingly 2 by the lower
courts in the mistaken belief that the Westermann case
required them to do so; that the legislative history of
§ 25, when considered in the light of earlier copyright
acts, indicates that the fourth subdivision, relating to
musical compositions, was not intended to be controlled
by the maximum and minimum provisions of the so-called
"no other case "-clause; and that the decision in the
Westermann case is not decisive of the question certified.
The argument is that § 25 was a codification of § 4965
and § 4966 of the Revised Statutes, which embodied a
distinction recognized in earlier Acts between the imposition of penalties for copying and the awarding of damages
for performing; that there is no language in § 25 indicating an intention to apply the maximum and minimum
provisions theretofore contained in the penal § 4965,
which dealt with unauthorized copying, to cases falling
2

Defendant relies upon statements in several cases in which the
courts have commented upon the ambiguity or severity of the Act.
See Waterson, Berlin & Snyder Co. v. Tollefson, 253 Fed. 859; M.
Witmark & Sons v. Pastime Amusement Co., 298 Fed. 471, 481;
Buck v. Jarvis, unreported, E. D. Va., decided March 23, 1927;
Dreamland Ball Room, Inc., v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F. (2d)
354, 355. Compare Irving Berlin, Inc., v. Daigle, 31 F. (2d) 832,
835. But in all of these cases the Westermann decision was followed.
Occasionally, where the statutory measure appeared burdensome
under the circumstances, courts have reduced or refused to allow
counsel fees. Fred Fisher, Inc., v. Dillingham, 298 Fed. 145, 152;
Cravens v. Retail Credit Mens' Assn., 26 F. (2d) 833, 836. But see
M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway, 22 F. (2) 412, 415.

within the former remedial § 4966, which gave damages for
unauthorized performing; and that a contrary intention
appears from the House Report of the 1909 Act.' This
argument overlooks the fact that the primary purpose of
§ 25 was to incorporate in one section all of the civil remedies theretofore given, including statutory damages
where actual proof was lacking. It is true that the second
subdivision, involved in the Westermann case, had been
part of the old penal § 4965 of the Revised Statutes. But
there is nothing to show an intention to exclude the infringements mentioned in the other subdivisions from the
operation of the maximum and minimum clause. The
history of the section as revealed in the extended hearings
which preceded the Act of 1909, makes the contrary clear.'
We are of opinion that the maximum and minimum provisions were intended to be applicable alike to all types of
8See H. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., February 22, 1909,
p. 15.

The statement relied upon is: "The provision that in lieu

of actual damages and profit such damages shall be awarded as shall
appear to the court just, not exceeding the sum of $5,000, is a modification of existing law, decreasing instead of increasing the amount
which may be obtained in this way." Defendant contends that this
sentence indicates an intention to continue the distinction between
scheduled damages for unauthorized performances, and penalties for
copying, the latter having been limited by the Act of March 2, 1895,
c. 194, 28 Stat. 965, to $10,000. Compare infra, Note 4.
' The suggested consolidation of Rev. Stat. § 4965 and § 4966 was
repeatedly attacked throughout the hearings, which lasted three years.
See Arguments before the Committee on Patents, on S. 6330 and
H. R. 19853, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., June 6-9, 1906, pp. 124, 137, 177;
id., December 7-11, 1906, pp. 36, 144, 176; compare id., March 26-28,
1908, pp. 21, 362. This section was, however, retained in the bill.
See H. Rep. No. 2222, supra Note 3, pp. 15-16; Sen. Rep. No. 1108,
60th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 15. In commenting on the bill, which was
the result of a series of conferences called by the Librarian of Congress,
the latter said, concerning the remedies for infringements: "One
inconvenience is that they [the existing statutes] provide a different
class of remedies and recoveries for different subject-matter; another

infringement except those for which the section makes
other specific provision.
It is urged, however, that under such interpretation the
suggested measure of ten dollars a performance, scheduled
in the fourth subdivision of § 25, would not be applicable
unless more than twenty-five infringing performances
were proved. This appears to be the meaning of the section, read as a whole, particularly since the amounts in
the scheduled subdivisions appear to have been inserted
merely as an aid to the court in awarding such damages as
"shall appear to be just." ' The definite specification of
a maximum and minimum in every case is not contra,
dicted in any way by these legislative suggestions as to
what may be deemed reasonable allowances in cases falling within the prescribed limitations. See Westermann
v. Dispatch Printing Co., 249 U. S. 100, 106, 109. If, as
is that they confuse the duty of the Government to punish a deliberate
infringement

. . .

with the right of the copyright proprietor for

compensation for his particular loss.

The bill attempts to provide

uniform remedies, and it divorces the civil action from the criminal."
Arguments before the Committees on Patents, supra, June 6-9, 1906,
p. 13. Compare Ann. Rep. of Register of Copyrights (1929), pp.
12-14. The provision to which reference was made was Rev. Stat.
§ 4965, as amended by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 194, 28 Stat. 965,
which provided that one-half of all penalties collected should accrue
to the United States. This section was repealed by § 63 (35 Stat.
1088) of the 1909 Act.
5
As originally proposed in June, 1906, the present Act provided
for a maximum and minimum applicable to all types of infringement,
and, in the then appended schedule, for an additional minimum in
the case of "a dramatic or musical composition, [of] not less than
one hundred dollars for the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent
infringing performance." Thus where more than four infringing performances were proved, this original schedule may have imposed a
higher minimum in such cases than the main clause. See § 23,
S. 6330, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., in Arguments before the Committees
on Patents, supra Note 4, p. ix. As finally enacted, it furnished
merely a guide for the court's discretion.

applied to musical compositions, the provisions of the
entire section have proved unreasonable, the remedy lies
with Congress.6 Question II is answered in the
affirmative.
Question III. "Is Section 25 (b) Fourth of the Copyright Act (17 U. S. C. Sec. 25) applicable, in the discretion of the Court, to a case disclosing infringement of
copyright covering a musical composition, there being no
proof of actual damage?"
This question has in part been necessarily answered by
our discussion of Question II, for unless the number of
infringing performances of a copyrighted musical composition exceeds twenty-five, the minimum allowance of
$250 must be made. Where more than twenty-five infringing performances are proved, and there is no showing
as to actual loss, the court must allow the statutory minimum, and may, in its sound discretion, employ the scheduled ten dollars a performance as a basis for assessing additional damages. See Westermann v. Dispatch Printing
Co., 249 U. S. 100, 106. Subject to this limitation,
Question III is answered in the affirmative.
Question IV. "In Section 25 (b) of the Copyright Act
(17 U. S. C. Sec. 25) is the clause reading, 'nor shall the
limitation as to the amount of recovery apply to infringements occurring after the actual notice to a defendant,'
confined in its scope to the particular cases of infringement theretofore specifically mentioned in said Section
25 (b)?"
6 The Westermann case was decided in 1919. Since that time there
have been repeated proposals to amend and/or completely revise the
Copyright Act. See Ann. Rep. Register of Copyrights (1928), pp.

6-11; id. (1929), pp. 16-24; id. (1930), pp. 8-13. No suggested
elimination of the minimum provision has been found. Compare
H. R. 11852, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., § 10; H. R. 12549, § 14 (c) and (d),
in H. Rep. No. 1732, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 8-9; Sen. Rep. 1732,

Syllabus.

202

Inasmuch as the plaintiffs did not ask for more than
the minimum statutory damages of $250, and did not
appeal from the decree awarding only this sum, the question whether the court might have awarded more than the
maximum of $5,000 is not properly raised upon the facts
presented in this certificate. We have no occasion to consider it. Dillon v. StrathearnS.S. Co., 248 U. S. 182, 184;
Reinecke v. Gardner,277 U. S. 239, 245; White v. Johnson,

As to Question IV, the certificate is dismissed.

Question III, Yes.
Question IV, not answered.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA.

No. 155.

Argued March 4, 1931.-Decided April 13, 1931.

1. The question whether a provision in an interstate bill of lading
limiting the time for filing claim for loss of property has been complied with is a federal question, to be determined by the application
of federal law. P. 212.
2. Where a bill of lading for an interstate shipment provides that
claim, in case of failure to make delivery, must be made in writing
to the carrier within six months after a reasonable time for delivery
has elapsed, the reasonable time meant is such time as is necessary
to transport and make delivery of the shipment in the ordinary
course of business, in the circumstances and conditions of the
transaction. P. 213.
3. A demurrer to the evidence must be tested by the same rules that
apply in respect of a motion to direct a verdict. In ruling, the
court must resolve all conflicts in the evidence against the defendant; but is bound to sustain the demurrer whenever the facts
established and the conclusions which they reasonably justify are
legally insufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff. P. 213.
