NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK CITY.
Argument for Defendant.

NEW JERSEY v. CITY OF NEW YORK.
No. 17, original.

Argued April 30, 1931.-Decided May 18, 1931.

1. The Court approves the findings of its Special Master showing
that the City of New York creates a nuisance in New Jersey by
dumping into the ocean large quantities of garbage which subsequently float into New Jersey waters and are washed up upon
New Jersey bathing beaches; and that the City has unreasonably
delayed to make provision for disposing of garbage by incineration.
Pp. 47T, 482.
2. Having jurisdiction of the defendant and of the property injured
by the nuisance, the Court has jurisdiction to enjoin the defendant
from dumping garbage in the ocean beyond the waters of New
Jersey and of the United States. P. 482.
3. The fact that the garbage is dumped at places permitted by the
Supervisor of the Harbor of New York under the Act of June 29,
1888, does not affect the Court's jurisdiction or constitute a
defense. Id.
4. A reasonable time should be accorded the City within which to
carry out its plan for the erection and operation of incinerators, or
to provide other means, to be approved by the decree, for disposing
of the objectionable substances; and the case is again referred to
the Special Master to find what is such reasonable time. P. 483.

is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Central R. Co. v. Jersey City, 209 U. S. 473, 479; Cunard S. S.

In cases of nuisance or trespass, the place where the
act occurs, which makes possible the nuisance or trespass, is the situs of the tort. Home v. City of Buffalo,

If the situs of the object inflicting the injury is the
controlling factor and that is outside the territorial limits
of the United States, why is not the matter of its abatement outside the jurisdiction of this Court. Cf. United

Certain cases which hold that where equity has jurisdiction of the person of the defendant it may give a personal
decree against him although the res of the controversy is
beyond the jurisdiction of the court, seem to be based on
the principle that the court's decree can be enforced personally by contempt proceedings if .disobeyed, or in some
other personal manner. A recalcitrant municipal corporation, however, cannot be imprisoned for contempt, or,
in the absence of statute, fined. Its public property cannot be taken for the purpose of collecting judgments
or enforcing decrees against it. Workman v. New York
City, 179 U. S. 552, 565.
Not every case involving a State as plaintiff and a citizen of another State as defendant, is justiciable under

The courts of both the States of New Jersey and New
York, as well as of other localities, have always held that
they had no jurisdiction over controversies like this.

Compliance with permits issued by the Supervisor
of the Harbor of New York under the Act of June 25,
1888 (25 Stat. 209) as amended (Title 33, c. 9, §§ 441-451,
U. S. Code), exculpates the defendant.
The Master erred in finding that garbage and refuse
reaching the plaintiff's shores from the dumpings by coastwise and other vessels, and from other sources, is negligible
in comparison with that dumped by defendant and reaching plaintiff's shores.
The Master erred in finding that the defendant has unreasonably delayed erecting incinerators to dispose of its
garbage.
There was a complete failure of proof by plaintiff as
to loss of property or values in its seashore communities.
There was evidence for defendant of the summer popularity, growth of the communities and investments therein, and increase in assessed values, during the years while
defendant is charged with fouling plaintiff's beaches and
waters.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
New Jersey invokes our original jurisdiction under § 2,
Art. III of the Constitution.
The complaint alleges that the City of New York for
many years has dumped and still is dumping noxious,
offensive and injurious materials-all of which are for
brevity called garbage-into the ocean; that great quantities of the same, moving on or near the surface of the
water, frequently have been and are being cast upon the
beaches belonging to the State, its municipalities and its
citizens, thereby creating a public nuisance and causing
great and irreparable injury. It prays an injunction re-

straining the City from dumping garbage into the ocean
or waters of the United States off the coast of New Jersey
and from otherwise polluting its waters and beaches.
Defendant by its amended answer denies the allegations
that constitute the gravamen of the complaint.
For a first defense it states that for many years it has
dumped garbage into the Atlantic Ocean under the supervision of the supervisor of the harbor of New York and
in accordance with permits issued by him under the Act
of June 29, 1888 (33 U. S. C., §§ 441, 443, 449 and 451)
at points about 8, 12 and 20 miles southeast from the
Scotland Lightship and about 10, 121/2 and 22 miles respectively from the New Jersey shore and not in the
waters of New Jersey or of the United States, and that
in view of these facts the Court has no authority to
enjoin it from so dumping garbage.
And for a second defense it alleges that for many years
garbage in large quantities has been and is being dumped
by others inside and outside the entrance of the harbor
and at various places from 21/2 to 8 miles from the New
Jersey shore and at other places from 3 to 25 miles southeast of Scotland Light, that this material would float upon
the New Jersey beaches alleged to have been polluted,
that it is impossible to determine whether garbage dumped
by defendant is carried to such beaches, and that, if any
injury or damage is suffered by New Jersey, its municipalities or citizens, the injury is not chargeable to
defendant.
And for a third defense it alleges that the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to any relief.
The Court appointed Edward K. Campbell as Special
Master and authorized him to take and report the evidence
together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and
recommendations for a decree. The Master filed his
report and the evidence introduced by the parties. It
sets forth his fndings, conclusions, and recommendations.

478

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The substance of the findings of facts follows:
New Jersey borders on the Atlantic for about 100 miles.
The shore principally involved extends from Atlantic
Highlands southerly 50 miles to Beach Haven. On this
stretch of shore, there are 29 municipalities. The State
has conveyed or leased portions of the frontage to municipalities and individuals. It still owns 285,000 lineal feet
between Sea Bright and Beach Haven. Municipalities
have about 13,000 lineal feet and private parties the rest.
The assessed value of property within these municipalities exceeds $139,000,000, and their population is more
than 160,000. They are summer resorts, and the number of summer visitors is many times greater than their
population. The beaches are gently sloping and wide
and have been improved at great expense. The ocean
and bathing, fishing and boating are the principal attractions. Inhabitants of the municipalities chiefly depend
for their livelihood upon the business of maintaining these
summer resorts. Approximately 500 persons are engaged
in the operation of fish pounds constructed under authority of the State within three nautical miles from the
coastline. This is a commercial activity that results in
the taking of large quantities of fish annually.
Vast amounts of garbage are cast on the beaches by
the waters of the ocean and extend in piles and windrows
along them. These deposits are unsightly and noxious,
constitute a menace to public health and tend to reduce
property values. Prompt removal is necessary, and men
are regularly employed to haul them away. At times
there are 50 truckloads deposited on a single beach. When
garbage is carried upon the shore the adjacent waters hold
large quantities in suspension. Floating garbage makes
bathing impracticable, frequently tears and damages fish
pound nets and injuriously affects the business of fishing.
Usually the sea along the shore clears within a few days

NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK CITY.

Opinion of the Court.

and sometimes within a single day. The deposits generally occur when the winds are from the east or northeast,
but sometimes southeast winds bring them in. The heavier deposits occur four or five times in a season and
frequently throughout the year, varying in number on
different beaches.
For about 20 years prior to 1918 defendant disposed of
its garbage by a reduction system and, except for a brief
period in 1906, did not dump any at sea. A plant was
destroyed by fire in 1917 and a contractor failed. It then
applied to the supervisor of the harbor for permission to
dispose of its garbage at sea and, because of the conditions
then existing, he gave such permission and designated a
dumping place. But later, because of complaint from
New Jersey beaches, he designated the areas specified in
defendant's answer. The defendant has installed and uses
some incinerating plants but, by reason of increasing population and volume of garbage, the quantities still being
dumped at sea are very large.
Weather permitting, the City dumps garbage daily.
Less is dumped in the winter than in the summer. In February, 1929, the quantity was 52,000 cubic yards, while in
June of the same year it was 192,000. When dumped, the
mass forms piles about a foot above the water, spreads
over the surface and breaks into large areas. Some materials remain on the surface and others are held in suspension. These masses float for indefinite periods and have
been found to move at the rate of more than a mile per
hour. Areas of garbage have been seen between the
dumping places and the New Jersey beaches, and some
have been followed from the place where dumped to the
shore. In his report to the chief of engineers for 1918 and
in each of his subsequent annual reports the supervisor of
the harbor of New York stated that garbage deposited in
the sea, no matter what the distance from the shore, is
liable to wash up on the beaches.

480

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The Master concluded that large parts of these floating
and submerged areas of garbage, dumped by the defendant, are driven and carried by winds and water to and
upon the shores of the plaintiff, and constitute the objectionable materials thereon and in the adjacent water.
In 1907 a committee appointed by the mayor reported
to him: "All of the refuse collections could be dumped
into the Atlantic ocean, but unfortunately the least harmful material sinks and the foulest floats, so that much of
the floatable mass will be scattered along beaches through
the action of current and wind. This fouling of beaches
creates a nuisance that the public should not be asked to
tolerate." In June, 1921, a committee composed of heads
of departments and officials of the City reported to the
mayor: "Aside, however, from the question of cost it
seems undesirable to dump garbage at sea as it is being
done at present. It is known that the Federal authorities
quietly resent, if they do not openly object to it, and
there is always the possibility of objections from other
communities which have in the past claimed that they
have been injured by the practice. When these objections become sufficiently strong it may be that New York
will find itself so unprepared as to be unable to quickly
introduce a more satisfactory form of disposal." The
defendant, through its mayor and other representatives,
has for years been informed that the dumping of its garbage is undesirable, and that other municipalities by the
sea have suffered injury as the result of such dumping.
Governors and the legislature of New Jersey have repeatedly complained to defendant. Ifi 1929 the City had
20 incinerators and considerable garbage is being destroyed
by them. In December of that year the department of
sanitation presented to the mayor a program for increasing the number. The cause of the delay in providing an
adequate disposal system was not shown.

NEW JERSEY v. NEW YORK CITY.
473

Opinion of the Court.

The Master concluded that the method of disposing of
garbage by dumping at sea was not an approved or a
good system and disposition of such material by incineration or the "reduction system" was a proper way to
dispose of the same. He found that the delay of defendant in adopting a proper method of disposal had been
unreasonably long.
The Master found that whatever garbage reaches the
plaintiff's shores from vessels and other dumpings than
those of the defendant was negligible in comparison with
that constantly being dumped by the defendant.
As his conclusions of law, the Master reports that the
defendant has created and continues to create a public
nuisance on the property of New Jersey and that the latter is entitled to relief in accordance with the prayer of
its complaint, but that defendant should be given reasonable time within which to put into operation sufficient
incinerators. He recommends that decree be entered
accordingly.
The plaintiff filed no exceptions to the Master's report.
The defendant excepted to substantially all material
findings and conclusions. The Court has heard the arguments of counsel for the respective parties and considered
their briefs for and against the exceptions and upon final
submission of the case. The evidence abundantly sustains the findings of fact.
The defendant maintains that the Master erred in concluding that it has unnecessarily delayed providing incinerators. The record shows that garbage gathered in the
Boroughs of Queens and Richmond has not been dumped
at sea. The quantities shown to have been so dumped
were taken from the Boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx and
Brooklyn. The amounts collected, the amounts dumped
and the percentage that the latter are of the former for the
years 1924 to 1929 inclusive were shown in the evidence

and are indicated in the margin.* While such percentages
have substantially decreased, the diminution of quantities
actually dumped has been relatively slight.
Further discussion of the evidence would serve no useful purpose. It is enough to say that defendant has suggested no adequate reason for disturbing the findings.
They are approved and adopted by the Court.
Defendant contends that, as it dumps the garbage into
the ocean and not within the waters of the United States
or of New Jersey, this Court is without jurisdiction to
grant the injunction. But the defendant is before the
Court and the property of plaintiff and its citizens that is
alleged to have been injured by such dumping is within
the Court's territorial jurisdiction. The situs of the acts
creating the nuisance, whether within or without the
United States, is of no importance. Plaintiff seeks a decree in personam to prevent them in the future. The
Court has jurisdiction. Cf. Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch 148,
158 et seq. Hart v. Sansom, 110 U. S. 151, 154. Cole v.
Cunningham, 133 U. S. 107, 116. Philadelphia Co. v.
Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 622-623.
There is no merit in defendant's contention, suggested
in its amended answer, that compliance with the supervisor's permits in respect of places designated for dumping
of its garbage leaves the Court without jurisdiction to
grant the injunction prayed and relieves defendant in
respect of the nuisance resulting from the dumping.
There is nothing in the Act that purports to give to one

Syllabus.

dumping at places permitted by the supervisor immunity
from liability for damage or injury thereby caused to
others or to deprive one suffering injury by reason of such
dumping of relief that he otherwise would be entitled to
have. There is no reason why it should be given that
effect.
The Master's conclusions of law and recommendations
for a decree are approved.
A decree will be entered declaring that the plaintiff, the
State of New Jersey, is entitled to an injunction as prayed
in the complaint, but that before injunction shall issue a
reasonable time will be accorded to the defendant, the
City of New York, within which to carry into effect its
proposed plan for the erection and operation of incinerators to destroy the materials such as are now being
dumped by it at sea or to provide other means to be
approved by the decree for the disposal of such materials.
And, in as much as the evidence does not disclose what is
such reasonable time the case is referred to the same
Special Master for findings of fact upon that subject. He
is authorized .and directed to hear witnesses presented by
each of the parties, and, should he deem it necessary so
to do, to call witnesses of his own selection and then with
all convenient speed to report to the Court his findings
and a form of decree.
It is so ordered.
