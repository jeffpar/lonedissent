SECOND CIRCUIT.
Nos. 521 and 522.

Argued April 29, 1931.-Decided May 18, 1931.

1. Prior to March, 1913, the taxpayer held shares in one of several
steel companies, owners of the stock of a company engaged in mining
ore under a long term lease. The lease did not require production
of maximum or minimum tonnage or any definite payments. By
agreement among themselves, the steel companies were entitled to
share the ore extracted according to their stock holdings in the
mining company. In 1916, the taxpayer and her co-shareholders
sold their shares to another steel company, which thus became
entitled to participate in the ores thereafter taken from the leased
mine. The consideration for the sale was part cash and in part
the purchaser's agreement to pay annually thereafter for distribution among the selling stockholders 60 cents for each ton of ore
apportioned to it. Held, that until the receipts by the taxpayer
under this contract shall have equalled the value of her shares in
March, 1913, they are return of capital and are not taxable in part
as income. P. 412.
2. Another of the vendor stockholders died in 1917, bequeathing her
interest in the payments to be made by the purchaser. Held that,
prior to return of the amount at which the bequest was valued
for federal estate tax purposes, the payments received by the legatee
are not income. P. 413.

Argument for Petitioner.

Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher and Messrs. Sewall Key and
J. Louis Monarch, Special Assistants to the Attorney
General, and Whitney North Seymour were on the brief,
for petitioner.
Respondents sold corporate stock, receiving therefor
part cash and an interest in a contract providing for a
payment of 60 cents on each ton of ore which the purchaser became entitled to take from the Mahoning mine.
Respondents later acquired additional interests in the
same contract by bequest from their mother.
The Commissioner determined that the contract had
a fair market value and accordingly treated the sale of
the stock as a closed transaction and valued the contract rights as of the time of their receipt, which he used
as the basis for apportioning the annual receipts from the
contract between income and capital.
The court below held that the fair market value of the
contract had not been established, that the sale of respondents' stock was not a closed transaction, and that
no part of the annual receipts from the contract was
income, because respondents had not yet received the
March 1, 1913, value of their stock or the value of the
inherited interests in the contract at the time of their
mother's death.
Whether property has a fair market value is a question
of fact. The finding of the Board that the contract had
fair market value was supported by substantial evidence
and should have been accepted by the court below, as
it was by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit in a group of cases presenting the same question
with respect to the same transaction. Irwin v. Gavit,

United States, 164 U. S. 380, 382; United States v. Supplee-Biddle Co., 265 U. S. 189, 196.
The annual receipts from the contract were inherently
income; and it is not entirely clear that respondents were
entitled to any of the statutory allowances for depletion
or exhaustion. However, an allowance was made by the
Board for the exhaustion of the contract, and for present
purposes we merely contend that it is sufficient. The
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit approved
the apportionment between income and capital, and its
decision is in direct conflict with the decision of the
court below. The requirement that capital must all
be returned tax free before there is any income is limited
to cases of sales, and in several decisions the courts have
held that, where the period of payment is extended over
several years, it is more logical to say there is some income
involved in each payment. Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens

Messrs. Herbert C. Smyth and John Enrietto, with
whom Messrs. Millard F. Tompkins and John W. Ford
were on the brief, for Mrs. Logan.
The transaction of March 11, 1916, was a sale of stock
and not an exchange of property for property; so that
there is no taxable gain until the aggregate payments
exceed the March 1, 1913, value of the stock. Johnson
v. Commissioner, 19 B. T. A. 840; Pinellas Ice Co. v.
Commissioner, 21 B. T. A. 425; Geary v. Commissioner,
6 B. T. A. 1109.
In determining the gain, if any, on the sale of property, the March 1, 1913, value must be deducted before
there is any taxable gain. Goodrich v. Edwards, 255
U. S. 527; Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179;
Burnet v. Thompson Oi & Gas Co., ante, p. 301; Lucas

Iron Co. v. Commissioner, 26 F. (2d) 30; Kosmerl v.
Commisowner, 25 F. (2d) 87; Platt v. Bowers, 13 F. (2d)
951; Eldredge v. United States, 31 F. (2d) 924.
It is stipulated that the total payment received by
the respondent from the sale of her 250 shares of stock,
down to and including the year 1920, was less than the
March 1, 1913, value of the shares sold. The fact that
some of the payments are spread over a series of years
does not render the statute inoperative and cause something less to be restored, to wit, the supposed present
value determined by mathematical formula of these future contingent payments. Hitchcock v. Commissioner,
44 F. (2d) 756, 757.
Before there is any taxable gain, the consideration
must be received and must be cash, or readily reducible
to cash. Bedell v. Commissioner, 30 F. (2d) 622, 624.
The transaction here involved cannot be treated as a

closed and completed transaction until the promise to
make the future payments is performed.
The expectation or prospect of profit does not give rise
to a taxable transaction. The gain must be realized.
Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 230; Safe Deposit &
Tr. Co. v. Miles, 273 Fed. 822, 825; Weiss v. Steam, 265
U. S. 242, 252; Lucas v. American Code Co., 280 U. S.
445, 449.
In the following cases on sales of property, the court
found that the gain, if any, is postponed to the date of
realization. United States v. Schillinger, 14 Blatch. 71;
United States v. Christine Oil Co., 269 Fed. 458; Bourn
v. McLaughlin, 19 F. (2d) 148; Tsivoglou v. United
States, 27 F. (2d) 564, affirmed, 31 F. (2d) 706.
The taxing statutes and regulations are s'mply aids in
arriving at income and cannot be used to create income.
Taplin v. Commissioner, 41 F. (2d) 454, 456.
The consideration consisting of a promise to make payments in the future, uncertain in amount, for a present
transfer of stock on March 11, 1916, was not the equivalent of cash, and hence, the transaction was not a closed
and completed one in 1916.
The question is whether any fair market value can be
definitely ascertained to the extent that a taxpayer can
be taxed for a profit merely because he is the promisee
and taxed on that profit before performance. A value
presupposes that it can be determined with substantial
certainty and without undue complexity. Algebraic formulae for determining values are not lightly to be imputed to legislators. Edwards v. Slocum, 287 Fed. 651.
The existence of a so-called intrinsic value is not sufficient to support a fair market value for purposes of
computing gain or loss. Bourn v. McLaughlin, 19 F.
(2d) 148; Tsivoglou v. United States, 27 F. (2d) 564,
affirmed, 31 F. (2d) 706.

BURNET v. LOGAN.

Opinion of the Court.

The promise to pay in this case is so contingent, uncertain and indefinite that it cannot be considered the
equivalent of cash or to have a "fair market value."
As to the interest in the payments bequeathed to Mrs.
Logan, she received no taxable income until the amounts
received by her exceeded the value at which they were
included in the gross estate for federal estate. taxation.
Even if the sale was a closed and completed transaction
in 1916, the apportionment of each payment thereafter
into capital and income, as made by the Board of Tax
Appeals and the Commissioner in each year, is wrong.
Mr. Raymond B. Goodell, with whom Mr. Walter M.
Anderson was on the brief, for Mrs. Bruce.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These causes present the same questions. One opinion,
stating the essential circumstances disclosed in No. 521,
will suffice for both.
Prior to March, 1913, and until March 11, 1916, respondent, Mrs. Logan, owned 250 of the 4,000 capital
shares issued by the Andrews & Hitchcock Iron Company.
It held 12% of the stock of the Mahoning Ore &. Steel
Company, an operating concern. In 1895 the latter corporation procured a lease for 97 years upon the "Mahoning" mine and since then has regularly taken therefrom
large, but varying, quantities of iron ore-in 1913, 1,515,428 tons; in 1914, 1,212,287 tons; in 1915, 2,311,940 tons;
in 1919, 1,217,167 tons; in 1921, 303,020 tons; in 1923,
3,029,865 tons. The lease contract did not require production of either maximum or minimum tonnage or any
definite payments. Through an agreement of stockholders (steel manufacturers) the Mahoning Company is obligated to apportion extracted ore among them according to
their holdings.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.
Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

On March 11, 1916, the owners of all the shares in Andrews & Hitchcock Company sold them to Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Company, which thus acquired, among other
things, 12% of the Mahoning Company's stock and the
right to receive the same percentage of ore thereafter
taken from the leased mine.
For the shares so acquired the Youngstown Company
paid the holders $2,200,000 in money and agreed to pay
annually thereafter for distribution among them 60 cents
for each ton of ore apportioned to it. Of this cash Mrs.
Logan received 250/4000ths--$137,500; and she became
entitled to the same fraction of any annual payment thereafter made by the purchaser under the terms of sale.
Mrs. Logan's mother had long owned 1100 shares of
the Andrews & Hitchcock Company. She died in 1917,
leaving to the daughter one-half of her interest in payments thereafter made by the Youngstown Company.
This bequest was appraised for federal estate tax purposes
at $277,164.50.
During 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920 the Youngstown
Company paid large sums under the agreement. Out of
these respondent received on account of her 250 shares
$9,900.00 in 1917, $11,250.00 in 1918, $8,995.50 in 1919,
$5,444.30 in 1920-435,589.80. By reason of the interest
from her mother's estate she received $19,790.10 in 1919,
and $11,977.49 in 1920.
Reports of income for 1918, 1919 and 1920 were made
by Mrs. Logan upon the basis of cash receipts and disbursements. They included no part of what she had
obtained from annual payments by the Youngstown Company. She maintains that until the total amount actually
received by her from the sale of her shares equals their
value on March 1, 1913, no taxable income will arise from
the transaction. Also that until she actually receives by
reason of the right bequeathed to her a sum equal to its

BURNET v. LOGAN.
404

Opinion of the Court.

appraised value, there will be no taxable income
therefrom.
On March 1, 1913, the value of the 250 shares then held
by Mrs. Logan exceeded $173,089.80-the total of all sums
actually received by her prior to 1921 from their sale
($137,500.00 cash in 1916 plus four annual payments
amounting to $35,589.80). That value also exceeded
original cost of the shares. The amount received on the
interest devised by her mother was less than its valuation
for estate taxation; also less than the value when acquired
by Mrs. Logan.
The Commissioner ruled that the obligation of the
Youngstown Company to pay 60 cents per ton had a
fair market value of $1,942,111.46 on March 11, 1916;
that this value should be treated as so much cash and the
sale of the stock regarded as a closed transaction with no
profit in 1916. He also used this valuation as the basis
for apportioning subsequent annual receipts between income and return of capital. His calculations, based upon
estimates and assumptions, are too intricate for brief statement.* He made deficiency assessments according to the
view just stated and the Board of Tax Appeals approved
the result.
In the brief for petitioner the following appears:
"The fair market value of the Youngstown contract on March 11,
1916, was found by the Commissioner to be $1,942,111.46. This was
based upon an estimate that the ore reserves at the Mahoning mine
amounted to 82,858,535 tons; that all such ore would be mined; that
12 per cent (or 9,942,564.2 tons) would be delivered to the Youngstown Company. The total amount to be received by all the vendors
of stock would then be $5,965,814.52 at the rate of 60 cents per ton.
The Commissioner's figure for the fair market value on March 11,
1916, was the then worth of $5,965,814.52, upon the assumption .that
the amount was to be received in equal annual installments during
45 years, discounted at 6 per cent, with a provision for a sinking
fund at 4 per cent. For lack of evidence to the contrary this
value wis approved by the Board. The value of the 550/4000 interest

Opinion of the Court.

283 U.S.

The Circuit Court of Appeals held that, in the circumstances, it was impossible to determine with fair certainty
the market value of the agreement by the Youngstown
Company to pay 60 cents per ton. Also, that respondent
was entitled to the return of her capital-the value of
250 shares on March 1, 1913, and the assessed value of
the interest derived from her mother-before she could
be charged with any taxable income. As this had not in
fact been returned, there was no taxable income.
We agree with the result reached by the Circuit Court
of Appeals.
The 1916 transaction was a sale of stock-not an exchange of property. We are not dealing with royalties
or deductions from gross income because of depletion of
mining property. Nor does the situation demand that an
effort be made to place according to the best available data
some approximate value upon the contract for future payments. This probably was necessary in order to assess the
mother's estate. As annual payments on account of extracted ore come in they can be readily apportioned first
as return of capital and later as profit. The liability for
income tax ultimately can be fairly determined without
resort to mere estimates, assumptions and speculation.
which each acquired by bequest was fixed at $277,164.50 for purposes of Federal estate tax at the time of the mother's death.
"During the years here involved the Youngstown Company made
payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, and respondents respectively received sums proportionate to the interests in the
contract which they acquired by exchange of property and by
bequest.
"The Board held that respondents' receipts from the contract,
during the years in question, represented 'gross income'; that
respondents should be allowed to deduct from said gross income a
reasonable allowance for exhaustion of their contract interests; and
that the balance of the receipts should be regarded as taxable
income."

BURNET v. LOGAN.

413

Opinion of the Court.

When the profit, if any, is actually realized, the taxpayer
will be required to respond. The consideration for the
sale was $2,200,000.00 in cash and the promise of future
money payments wholly contingent upon facts and circumstances not possible to foretell with anything like fair
certainty. The promise was in no proper sense equivalent
to cash. It had no ascertainable fair market value. The
transaction was not a closed one. Respondent might
never recoup her capital investment from payments only
conditionally promised. Prior to 1921 all receipts from
the sale of her shares amounted to less than their value
on March 1, 1913. She properly demanded the return of
her capital investment before assessment of any taxable
profit based on conjecture.
"in order to determine whether there has been gain
or loss, and the amount of the gain, if any, we must
withdraw from the gross proceeds an amount sufficient to
restore the capital value that existed at the commencement of the period under consideration." Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., 247 U. S. 179, 184, 185. Rev. Act 1916,
§ 2, 39 Stat. 757, 758; Rev. Act 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057.
Ordinarily, at least, a taxpayer may not deduct from gross
receipts a supposed loss which in fact is represented by
his outstanding note. Eckert v. Commisioner of Internal
Revenue, ante, p. 140. And, conversely, a promise to
pay indeterminate sums of money is not necessarily taxable income. "Generally speaking, the income tax law
is concerned only with realized losses, as with realized
gains." Lucas v. American Code Co., 280 U. S. 445, 449.
From her Mother's estate Mrs. Logan obtained the right
to share in possible proceeds of a contract thereafter to
pay indefinite sums. The value of this was assumed to
be $277,164.50 and its transfer was so taxed. Some valuation-speculative or otherwise-was necessary in order
to close the estate. It may never yield as much, it may

yield more. If a sum equal to the value thus ascertained
had been invested in an annuity contract, payments thereunder would have been free from income tax until the
owner had recouped his capital investment. We think
a like rule should be applied here. The statute definitely
excepts bequests from receipts which go to make up taxable income. See Burnet v. Whitehouse, ante, p. 148.

plainly indicate that Congress held in mind the distinction between
a positive mandate to the Secretary and permission to take certain
