BURNET v. HENRY.

stock, together with certain bonds, not otherwise described, constituted on March 1, 1913, the entire available
assets remaining of the original "Segal matters." There
seems to have been no difficulty in ascertaining the value
of the stock in 1920; and it is hard to see why its value,
as well as the value of the bonds, could not have been, at
least approximately, determined as of March 1, 1913, and,
consequently, the approximate value of the contingent interest of each of the subscribers to the fund ascertained as
of that date. No reason is suggested by the record or
otherwise, and none occurs to us, for not seeking light on
the subject from those who had been in charge of the
liquidation of the "Segal matters." We cannot assume
that such an effort would have been fruitless. Respondent was bound to produce the best available evidence of value which the circumstances and nature of the
transaction permitted. It does not appear that he made
any attempt to do so.

Statement of the Case.

283 U.S.

H. Conner, Special Assistants to the Attorney General,
Erwin N. Griswold, and Clarence M. Charest, General
Counsel, and Allin H. Pierce, Special Attorney, Bureau of
Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. William Clarke Mason, with whom Mr. John Russell, Jr., was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question in this case is the same as that which has
been determined against the respondent in Burnet v.
Houston, ante, p. 223. The subscription to the fund described in our opinion in that case was not made by respondent direct, but by her brother, Samuel F. Houston,
acting as her agent. Otherwise the facts are the same; and
upon the authority of the Houston case the judgment of
the court below, 39 F. (2d) 358, is
Reversed.
