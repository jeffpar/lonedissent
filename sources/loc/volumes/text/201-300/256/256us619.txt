been described; and, secondly, whether such immunity
properly can be claimed in respect of the ship of a government which has severed and not resumed diplomatic relations with the United States. Both questions are important and also new. Their proper solution is not plain
but debatable. This is frankly recognized in the brief
supporting the motion. Even in admiralty cases a writ
of prohibition goes as a matter of right only where the
absence of jurisdiction is plain. Where the jurisdiction
is debatable the granting or refusal of the writ is discretionary. Ex parte Muir, 254 U. S. 522. It-is nbt plain
that there is an absence of jurisdiction here, for the question is an open one and of uncertain solution. On application to the State Department, it declined to ask the
Attorney General to present to the District Court a
suggestion avowing that the ship belonged to the Turkish
or Ottoman Government and was immune from seizure.
We regard the situation as one in which to refuse the writ
would be a proper exercise of discretion. There are

stronger reasons against granting a writ of mandamus.

Mr. John W. Gr(An for petitioner:
In the absence of a restraints-of-princes clause, the
shipowner's obligation under the charterparty was absolute, and prevention by foreign law was not a defense.
Where a shipowner enters into an absolute covenant
to carry a cargo, without protecting himself by exceptions,
he is bound to perform it or to pay damages. An examination of the charter in suit shows that it contains no
exception whatever applicable to the situation. Spence

The law has long been settled to the effect that, where
there is an absolute obligation, difficulty or even impossibility of performance is no defense, except in cases of
personal disability preventing performance of a contract
for personal service, destruction of the subject-matter
upon the continued existence of which the contract
depends, and prohibition by domestic law.
The ship did not cease to exist, any more than if she had
been delayed by stranding or by collision, or by any other
obstacle. She was merely subjected to a restraint (assuming that the requisition was valid) of a kind not excepted
in the charter and not permanent in its nature. Such a
situation cannot be treated as an instance of destruction
of the subject-matter of the contract. It is simply a
case where performance has been rendered impossible
for the moment by foreign law.
The case presents merely another instance of prevention
by foreign law of the performance of an American contract-the same situation which has been so often and so
uniformly dealt with by the courts both of this country
and of England. 8 Elliott on Contracts, par. 1891; 2

The foregoing authorities indicate what has always been
considered clear law-that, in the absence of an exception in
the contract, the interference of a foreign government preventing the performance of the contract is not a legal excuse.
This is well settled both in England and in this country.
The District Court sought to bring the present case
within the authorities by calling it a case where the vessel
had become non-existent. This is a mere figure of speech.
It might equally well be said that, whenever the act of a
foreign government prevents the loading of a cargo, that
cargo is non-existent, and yet in case after case it has been
held that liability exists under such circumstances. Indeed, any case of impossibility might be stated in the same
sort of figurative language. Where there is truly destruction of the subject-matter, a peculiar situation is created,
with which the law usually deals by declaring, as the
fairest solution, that the contract is annulled. But where,
the subject-matter being intact, an obstacle arises to
performance by one party, the question is: Is the nature

TEXAS CO. r. HOGARTH SHIPPING CO.
619.

623

Argument for Petitioner.

of the obstacle such that, under the law or according to
the provisions of the contract, the default is excused?
There was no frustration of the charter. If the doctrine
of frustration is applied to cases where performance is
prevented by foreign law, then either the general rule
must be overturned (which is inconceivable) or else such
cases must be treated as exceptional,. and a new rule of
law must be established to cover them.
The doctrine of frustration appears to be an effort to
correct what, in some cases, has been regarded as the injustice of enforcing a contract under circumstances fumdamentally different from those which the parties foresaw
or could reasonably have been expected to foresee. The
court in effect makes for the parties a new contract; or,
perhaps more accurately, declines to enforce, for equitable
reasons, the contract which the parties themselves have
made.
Only in a case of the plainest need should such a remedy
be applied, and it should never be applied to a case where
the parties must have had the contingency in contemplation and simply failed to provide for it. Under those
circumstances, it is submitted, no court can annul this
or any other contract.
The so-called doctrine of frustration is really new in
name rather than in nature. Nearly all the cases are
simply instances of the well recognized types of impossibility. No court has held a contract frustrated unless
the obstacle clearly appeared to be such as necessarily to
postpone the performance of the contract beyond the
time when it would be fair or reasonable to require the
parties to perform it. Citing and applying or distinguishing the following: A llanuilde Transport Corporationv. Vacuum 0M Co., 248 U. S. 377; The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, 244

In order to succeed under the facts of this case, the
owners must establish that the mere fact of requisition,
ipso facto and without more, as matter of law, terminated
the charter. Without an exception, without proof of the
probable length of the requisition, without any facts in
the record from which the court can reach a conclusion
about its probable length, there is nothing here but the
mere fact that the veasel was requisitioned. No case has
ever held that this alone is enough to accomplish frustration; numerous cases have held the contrary.
The alleged requisition was not a legally valid requisition.

ex parte statements, preclude the courts of the United
States from ascertaining the true facts with regard to it;
nor should the courts of the United States receive or act
on such statements, at least unless made through and
with the sanction of the Department of State.
Whether or not the requisition was valid, the employment of the Baron 0gifry from April to October, 1915, was
not under any requisition but under a voluntary charter,
and the certificate of the British Embassy should not be
construed as contradicting this undisputed fact.
The respondents, after the happening of the alleged
requisition, did not make efforts to secure the release of
the vessel or to substitute other tonnage.

MR. JUsTICE VAN DEvANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
This is a suit in admiralty to recover damages for an
alleged breach of a voyage charterparty entered into in
New York, February 6, 1915, between a British corporation, which owned the Baron Og7lvy and other freight
ships, and a Texas corporation, which was engaged in
shipping and marketing petroleum products. The charterparty did not name a particular ship as the subject of the
hiring, but required that one of a certain type be designated from among the ships of the British company; on
or before March 15. In due time that company named
the Baron Ogilty and the Texas company assented. 'The
intended voyage was from a port in Texas to another in
South Africa with a full cargo of refined petroleum in cases.
The ship was to be tendered at the initial port ready to
load between April 15 and May 15, 1915, and in case of

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

default the Texas company was given the option of canceling or maintaining the charterparty. If the vessel
was then at that port, the option was to be exercised at
once and if she was not then there, it was to be exercised
within twenty-four hours after her arrival. There was
no clause expressly excepting restraints of princes, etc.
April 10, 1915, the Baron Ogtivy, while in British waters
and being provisioned for the intended voyage, was
requisitioned by the British Government and pressed
into its war service, in which she continuously was retained until October 20, following. On April 12 the
British company notified the Texas company that the
vessel had been requisitioned and therefore would not be
available to carry out the charterparty. The Texas
company thereupon prodiired another vessel to make
the voyage at the time intended, but at an increased
freight rate, and subsequently brought this suit against
the British company on the theory that the latter had
broken the charterparty and was liable in damages for
the difference between the rate which it was to receive
and that actually paid to the other vessel. On the final
hearing the District Court rendered a decree for the
respondent, the principal grounds of the decision Ieing
(a) that when in accordance with the terms of the charterparty the Baron Ogvy was named as the ship to make
the voyage the contract became an ordinary voyage
charterparty for that ship, and none other, and (b) that
that ship, before the time for the voyage, was taken in
inibum by the owner's government for war use for a
period likely to extend beyond the time for the intended
voyage and that this dissolved the charterparty and
excused the owner from furnishing the ship. 265 Fed.

of Appeals, 267 Fed. Rep. 1023; and a writ of certiorari

We agree that after the designation of the Baron Ogilvy,

TEXAS CO. v. HOGARTH SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

conformably to a provision in the charterparty, every
element of an ordinary voyage charterparty for a particular ship was present. It was then as if that vessel
had been named at the outset. And, as there was no provision for substituting another ship, there was no obligation on the part of the owner to furnish, nor on the
part of the charterer to accept, another. NickoU & Knight
v. Ashton, Edridge & Co., 11901] 2 K. B. 126, 131. The
contract related to a particular ship just as it related to
a particular voyage. Neither could be changed without
departing from the contract, which could not be done
without the consent of both parties.
The libelant challenges the good faith of the owner and
seeks by taking mere fragments of the evidence here ani
there to show that the owner invited the requisition,
welcomed it as promising a better return than the charterparty, and in effect voluntarily turned the vessel over to
the government. But the fragments to which attention
is invited must be read with the context and all the evidence must be considered. When this is done it becomes
very plain that there is no basis for the challenge. The
owner made the usual preparations for complying with
the charterparty, earnestly sought to prevent the requisitioning of the vessel, urged the existence of the
charterparty as a reason for leaving her free, and respected
the requisition, when made, because no other course was
reasonably open. It may not be material, but in fact the
charterparty gave promise of a better return and called
for a service which would be less hazardous. The vessel
was taken by the government for the use to which she
was subjected and after the taking the owner agreed to
furnish certain additional facilities by reason of which a
higher compensation was obtained than otherwise would
have been allowed. Beyond this the owner was accorded
no voice in the matter.
As the ship was British and in British waters and the

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

owner was a British corporation the power of the British
Government to requisition the ship is beyond question.
But the libelant insists that those who assumed to exert
this power did not proceed in the mode prescribed and
therefore that the requisition was invalid. The facts
adequately proved are as follows: A Royal Proclamation of August 3, 1914, authorized and empowered the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty "by warrant under
the hand of their Secretary " "to requisition and take
up "British vessels within British waters for use as transports and auxiliaries. The Baron Ogi/j was requisitioned
by an order of the Lords Commissioners and the order
was communicated to the owner by a telegram signed
"Tanspmrs " and saying: "SS. Baron Ogilvy is requisitioned ider Royal Proclamation for government service."
The telegram was sent by the Assistant Director of Military Sea Transports, the officer through whom requisi-

tioning orders were executed. This was the usual mode
of communicating such orders. Formal warrants never
were issued. Generally, the telegraphic communication
was followed, after a time, by a letter of like import bedring a block (printed) signature of the Secretary; but in
this instance, through an error in office routine, no letter
was sent. These letters were intended to be corroborative,
but were not deemed essential; and in actual practice the
Lords Commissioners and those who executed their orders
proceeded on the theory that the ship was taken when
the order was received by the owner, however the order
was communicated, and that a telegraphic communication
of it was effective and must-be obeyed. Indeed, the evidence is that if the telegraphic order was not obeyed the

vessel would be taken by force.

The owner here-six

of whose ships had been requisitioned theretofore--so
understood the practice and respected the order. It does
not appear that the government at any time or in any
way disapproved of the practice, but does appear that in

TEXAS CO. v. HOGARTH SHIPPING CO.
619.

629

Opinion of the Court.

this instance the government treated te telegraphic order
as effective by using the ship as a transport for more than
six months and compensating the owner accordingly.
In these circumstances, the contention that the requisition
was invalid is quite untenable. Whether in different
circumstances it could and should be pronounced invalid
here we need not consider. See Underhill v. Hernandez,
168 U. S. 250; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,
213 U. S. 347; Oetjen v. CentralLeather Co., 246 U. S. 297,
303, 304; Ricaud v. American Metal Co., 246 U. S. 304,
309; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Trading Co.,
195 U. S. 439, 467-468.
In the District Court the British Ambassador was permitted to intervene as amics curiw, object to the adjudication of the libelant's claim and present a certificate
avowing that the requisition was a governmental act.
Complaint is made of this. The permission was improvidently granted, as was afterwards indicated by this
court in other cases. Ex parte Muir, 254 U. S. 522; The
Pesaro, 255 U. & 216. But the libelant was not prejudiced, for the intervention and certificate ultimately
were not considered and the decree was rested on the evidence otherwise presented.
Fmally, the libelant insists that the requisition, even if
valid and not invited by the owner, did not operate to
dissolve the charterparty or to excuse the owner from

performing it. The courts below held otherwise, and we
think rightly so.
It long has been settled in the English courts and in
those of this country, federal and state, that where parties
enter into a contract on the assumption that some particular thing essential to its "performance will continue to
exist and be available for the purpose and neither agrees
to be responsible for its continued existence and availability, the contract must be regarded as subject to an
implied condition that, if before the time for performanoe

and without the default of either party the particular
thing ceases to exist or be available for the purpose, the
contract shall be dissolved and the parties excused from
performing it. Taylor v. Caldwell, 3 Best & Smith, 826,
839; In re Shipton, Anderson & Co. [19151 3 K. B. 676;
Horlock v. Bea [1916] 1 A. C. 486, 494, 496, 512; Bank

Siegel, Cooper & Co., 237 ]llinois, 610. The principle
underlying the rule is widely recognized and applied to
various classes of contracts. The Kronprinzessin Cecilie,
244 U. S. 12, 22-24. But, of course, it does not applywhere
the risk is fully covered by a term of the contract, nor
where performance is not practically cut off but only
rendered more difficult or costly. Columbus Railway,
Power & Light Co. v. Columbus, 249 U. S. 399, 410, et seq.
Perhaps the oldest and most familiar application of the
principle is to contracts for personal service, where performance is prevented by death or illness. Robinson v.
Daviso,

(1871) L R. 6 Exch. 269; Spalding v. Rosa, 71

N. Y. 40. Another application widely recognized is where
a ship chartered for a voyage, after the date of the charterparty and before the time for the voyage, is accidentally
destroyed by fire, lost at sea, or injured in such degree as
not to be available for the service. The Tornado, supra,
was a suit on a contract of affreightment where the ship,
before beginning the voyage, was accidentally burned
and theieby prevented from undertaking it. This court
neld that the contract was dissolved, saying, p. 349:
"We are of opinion that by the disaster which occurred
before the ship had broken ground or commenced to earn
freight, the cirremstances with reference to which the

TEX S CO. r. HOGARTH SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court.

contract of affreightment was entered into were so altered
by the supervening of occurrences which it cannot be
intended were within the contemplation of the parties
in entering into the contract, that the shipper and the
underwriters were absolved from all liability under the
contract of affreightment. The contract had reference to
a particular ship, to be in existence as a seaworthy vessel
and capable of carrying cargo and earning freight and of
entering on the voyage. All the fundamental conditions
forming part of the contract of the ship-owner were wanting
at the time when the earning of freight could commence."
Here the ship, although still in existence and entirely
seaworthy, was rendered unavailable for the performance
of the charterparty by the requisition. By that supervening act she was impressed into the war service of the
British Government for a period likely to extend--and
which as it turned out did extend-long beyond the time
for the charter voyage. In other words, compliance with
the charterparty was made impossible by an act of state,
the charterer was. prevented from having the service of
the ship and the owner from earning the stipulated freight
The event apparently was not anticipated and there was no
provision casting the risk on either party. Both assumed
that the ship would remain available and that was the
basis of their mutual engagements. These, we think,
must be regarded as entered into on an implied condition
that, if before the time for the voyage the ship was rendered unavailable by such a supervening act as the
requisition, the contract should be at an end and the parties absolved from liability under it.
That the charterparty was entered into in this country
is not material. The important consideration is that it
became impossible of performance through a supervening
act of state which operated directly on the ship and the
parties could not avoid.

Decree afaimed.
